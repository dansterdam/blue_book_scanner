PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 23 Oct 60, 21/2143 MDT
2. LOCATION: 15 miles SW of Twin Falls, Idaho
3. SOURCE: 
4. NATURE OF OBJECTS: 1) Other (PROBABLE: ROCKET LAUNCH) 2) Astro (POSSIBLE STARS/PLANETS)
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 - 7 minutes
7. COURSE: Stationary - Visual
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer was driving his tractor when the headlights and radio went out. He noticed a large light rising over the horizon. From within this light as much brighter and smaller light appeared much like a 4th of July rocket except it did not explode. The larger light gradually faded until it disappeared.

COMMENTS: A Minuteman rocket was launched from Vandenberg AFB, California at 1939 PST of 21 Oct 60 (2139 MST); and appears to be the stimulus of the visual sighting. There is no evidence that the visual sightings and the electrical failures are related. The sightings of 11 and 13 Nov are possibly stars and/or planets.

Describe your impression of what it looked like, how it moved, how you estimated its size and distance, and anything else that will help in evaluating the report.

It first appeared to be a steady light about the size of a dime at arm's length. It gradually increased in size until it was about as large as a basketball at arm's length. It then started oscillating, changing color from white to red to green. Sometimes it appeared stationary, other times it moved slowly. Moments later it suddenly disappeared from sight. Its direction of travel was approximately south.

The observer felt a strange sensation during the sighting, as if some form of energy was being emitted by the object. He said, "It was like being under a high tension line, it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up".

This image does not contain any photograph or visual representation. It appears to be a handwritten document or report, likely from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text of the document is as follows:

"On the night of Nov. 6, 1969 I was awakened by a bright light illuminating the hilly countryside southwest of my home, about 15 miles southwest of Twin Falls, Idaho. This light, or "craft", as it appeared to be, seemed to be hovering or resting on the ground. It remained stationary for at least 11 minutes.

Some time after this aircraft, or whatever it was, began moving very slowly in a westerly direction. It was a brilliantly lighted, oval-shaped object. When it began moving, it moved upwards slightly, then slowly moved westward with a very slight swaying motion, almost like a pendulum. It moved very slowly, seemed to be about 25-30 feet above the ground, and disappeared behind a hill about a mile distant.

The night was clear, and I had an unobstructed view of the phenomenon. Its size, from where I observed it, appeared to be about 35-40 feet in diameter. It illuminated a wide area around it, and the countryside was quite bright while it remained there. After it moved out of sight, all was dark again. I've never seen anything like this before, and I'm quite sure there is no logical, earthly explanation for what I observed. The experience has left me rather shaken. There was no sound at all."

The image contains a diagram that appears to depict the position and movement of an unidentified phenomenon or object. The diagram includes an observer's position, angled lines, and some measurements or angles. There is no photographic image included in this particular document page.

had observed strange lights in the sky the week prior to this investigation. As these sightings appeared to have been the most recent reported, a complete investigation was conducted. The INVESTIGATOR CONCERNING THIS WITNESS IN THE TWIN FALLS, IDAHO SIGHTING:

Mrs. [redacted] is a housewife, living on a small farm in a rural farming community approximately twelve (12) miles southwest of Twin Falls, Idaho. She lives with her husband and one (1) daughter. She appears to be a normal, well-adjusted reliable person. She was intelligent and trained as a former school teacher. At no time was it indicated that the family indulged in intoxicants of any kind. She did not appear to be dramatic about what she had seen nor did she appear to be completely disinterested. She stated that the thought it was something the Air Force was doing which she had no need to know about.  She further explained that she realized the Air Force conducted a lot of tests that were not made public and that she accepted this as being necessary. Neither she nor her daughter living with them were interviewed.

[Redacted] lives in the same rural farming community approximately four (4) miles from Mrs. [redacted]. He lives with his wife and two (2) small children. They appear to be normal, well-adjusted, hard working people. There was no indication that the family indulged in intoxicants of any kind.

FINDINGS BY THE INVESTIGATOR:

The area where they live is generally flat land, broken by low ridges and void of heavy vegetation. This land is used as grazing land for some small farms in the area. Recently, farmers in this area have been plagued with the use of hay crops and one-buildings due to mysterious fires. The general feeling in the area is that a predominant has been the cause of these fires. Many farmers and families have been maintaining night vigilance over their property. This explains why [redacted] was looking out the window of her house at the time.
