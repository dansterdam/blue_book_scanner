Dear Sirs:
This note confirms you of the U.S. Air Force sighting reported in my letter of February 22, 1967. It was while 75 feet above a cornfield near Kettering, Ohio, I saw an object, a round disc, hovering near the ground. I am not a crackpot, nor am I seeking publicity, for I know that most people will think this incredible. From the experience I had, I am convinced that what I saw was an Unidentified Flying Object and have a few sketches concerning them, but cannot forward them at this time. I have read the various ways you think we may be seeing natural phenomena, but still insist that what I saw was a metallic craft of unconventional design, hovering silently about 75 feet above the ground. I noticed the "thing" outside was a field of cornstalk and it appeared to be circular in design with a dome on top, with a small light on the top. As it began to rise, a bright light emanated from underneath and it made a slight humming sound as it moved away. I realize it might seem rather far-fetched, but I can assure you that it was at a most close to center of way.

Text extracted from the image:

Where a photograph was felt immediately and shown to others to be very bright, red-orange color appeared to be very white looking, like the shape of an inverted pear with a stem-like projection on top. Several witnessed the object on 24 Feb 1967 at about 7:40 p.m. while driving south on the Dayton-Trenton Road in Kettering, Ohio. The object was first seen in the sky, moved rapidly and suddenly disappeared. No sound was heard. The object appeared to be metallic and its movement gave the impression of rapid acceleration. The observer(s) seemed confused and taken by surprise. I interviewed the sighters and checked their reliability. All information given checked out. The sighters seemed sincere and appeared to be normal persons. I am forwarding this report for your consideration. Your comments and evaluation would be appreciated.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
