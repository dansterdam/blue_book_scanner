Dear [redacted],

Reference your recent letter concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object in March 1967.

We are hesitant in offering any explanation for the sighting without additional information such as detailed flight characteristics, and angular velocities.

Our responsibility does not cover the investigation of sightings outside the continental limits of the United States; therefore, we are unable to perform a comprehensive investigation. Your information will, however, be added to the present data base.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the United States Air Force.

There is no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report. The image contains text from a letter dated September 19, 1967, written by the Chief of the Civil Branch of the Community Relations Division of the Office of Information for the Department of the Air Force. The letter responds to a previous letter concerning the observation of an "unidentified flying object (UFO)". The letter indicates that the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be helpful in identifying the observation and thanks the recipient for reporting the observation to the Air Force.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Sir,

This replies to your recent letter concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO). With reference to the description of the characteristics, angular velocity, or weather information, we are unable to make a scientific investigation. Had you contacted the UFO investigators at your nearest Air Force base, this investigation would have been made immediately, an on-the-spot investigation would have been conducted.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help to you in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information

Proposed reply to letter from July 30, 1957

Dear [redacted],

Reference your recent letter regarding an unidentified flying object (UFO) which was observed in March 1957.

With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essential data such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation. If your grandmother had reported her observation to the nearest military installation at the time, an evaluation would have been possible. The local UFO investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your information will be added to our present data base.

The enclosed brochure on the Air Force project on UFOs may be of interest to you. Thank you for bringing the observation to our attention.

Dear Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.

I am typing this for my Grandma sometime in March 1967 about 2:15 A.M. My Grandma heard the two big dogs Tarzan and Rex barking. She got up to let Cindy our small dog out and quite the big dogs as they were barking. Cindy jumped out and ran up the road barking, my Grandma looked up the road and saw a large object with red yellow and blue lights that was hovering over an orchard about a 1/2 or a mile away. She went back to bed because she was scared, about twenty minutes later she looked again and it was gone.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Last night around 9 p.m. I saw a strange light in the sky. The light had a very fast speed of motion and was quite intensely bright. It seemed to be a solid object and was making a slight humming sound. The object maneuvered in the sky for some time, then suddenly made a sharp turn and disappeared from sight at a terrific speed. I have no explanation for what I saw, as it was not anything like an airplane, meteor, or satellite. I would appreciate any further investigation you can conduct regarding this incident. (known running lights, observed, and such a memorable report)

The object observed was round or elliptical in shape. Its motion was erratic, moving at a high rate of speed and then stopping, hovering, and making sharp turns. It appeared to be a solid object and not a reflection or illusion. The color was reddish or reddish-orange. No sound was heard. The object was observed for several minutes before disappearing over the horizon.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed description of a UFO sighting. There is a redacted or blacked-out section in the middle of the text.

UFO form continued
The size of the UFO was very impressive. The aircraft was strangely flattened. They appeared to be circular. It would appear that the whole surface of the craft was metallic and smooth. There were no protrusions or windows visible. I would estimate the size of the craft to be approximately 80 to 100 feet in diameter. I watched this from beyond 100 yards and the speed at which this craft accelerated vertically was incredible. This was a high speed and very low pitch.

The object is also described as strangely flattened, circular, and metallic and smooth in appearance, with no protrusions or windows visible. The text indicates that the witness estimated the size of the craft to be approximately 80 to 100 feet in diameter, and observed its incredible vertical acceleration.
