There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing text describing various fields to be filled out, such as "Location of Observer(s)", "Identifying Information on Observer(s)", "Weather and Winds", and other details related to documenting UFO sightings.

Here is the text from the document:

Light conditions: (use on of the following terms: dawn, dusk)

Location of Observer(s): Exact latitude and longitude of position which reference to a known geographic landmark also should be given in electrical reports, such as "9 mi N of Deev, 6/ SF Blue Lakes". Topographical errors or "crawling" often result in transmitted messages, making location plots difficult or impossible.

EXAMPLE: 39 14'N, 192 7'W for 39 16'N, 102 21'W.

f. Identifying Information on Observer(s):
(1) Civilian — Name, mailing address, occupation, and reliability.

(2) Report from nearest AWS or U.S. Weather Bureau Office direction and velocity indices at surface, 5,000', 10,000', 20,000', 30,000', 50,000', and 80,000' if available.
(3) Ceiling: 5,000 overcast, 13,000 broken, hourly.
(4) Visibility: 13 miles.
(5) Amount of cloud cover: 1/2 overcast, hourly.
