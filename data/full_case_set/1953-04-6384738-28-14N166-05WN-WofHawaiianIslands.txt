11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
One object traveling at a speed estimated as faster than jet a/c was observed traveling from NW to SW at 2,000 ft. altitude. It was metallic silver in color, round, and about the size of an F-80.

COMMENT: Position of the ship was NW of the Hawaiian Islands within range of jet fighter a/c. Observers say "object appears to remain stationary for a few seconds". An a/c at a distance making a sharp turn could appear stationary. Also a/c at a distance frequently appear round.

Second Officer A. Horrigan of the American SS. American
Starling, Capt. G. Bitsikas, Master, reports the following obser
vation: 

“On April 14, 1953, at 1456 G. M. T., in lat. 35°07’ N., lon.
153°08' E, a meteor was observed bearing 320° at an altitude of
30°. The meteor traveled almost horizontally and disappeared
bearing 295° at an altitude of 25°. The movement of this meteor
was relatively slow being visible for from 5 to 7 seconds, and was
a brilliant white light about twice the magnitude of Venus. The
unusual sight excited the imagination of the lookout who reported
lights in the sky. It, indeed, resembled no meteor that this ob
server had ever witnessed, for about halfway in its travel the
meteor seemed to be five lights moving in procession. There 
was no increase or decrease in the brilliancy of the light and/or
lights which resembled a mother ship which had launched and
was guiding other ships. All five lights moved across the sky in
a line and then suddenly disappeared simultaneously on the bear
ing and altitude mentioned above.”

NON-SCHEDULED NEWSLETTER #25
November 10th, 1965

Important Notice: This Newsletter contains several of the most unusual reports that we have received in recent months. Please do not write us asking for further information. Names and other identifying detalls which have been deleted from these reports are in our confidential files, but cannot be given out to anyone.

FROM THE GRAPEVINE:

WE HEAR of an amazing saucer report that the Ar Force will undoubtedly deny: On April 15th, 1953, a mysterious object thirty feet in diameter was observed landing at an Air Torce base in the midsouthern United States. Startled personnel gaped as they saw three "little men" disembark from the craft and walk towards them. One of the "men” reached into a small enclosure hanging from the right side of his space suit, and took out an object that resembled a gun. A panic-stricken soldier took a rifle and shot at him, apparently inflicting a mortal wound. The others picked up their injured companion, re-entered their craft, and took off, disappearing rapidly in the sky. Jets were scrambled, but the saucer could not be located, despite an intensive search by tracking instruments.
WE HEAR that a major UFO author is presently writing propaganda for the U. S. Information Agency, and other Governmental connections have been hinted at.
WE HEAR that scientists on the other side of the Iron Curtain are almost frantic in their efforts to sguoich the increasingly widespread reports of saucer landings in the Soviet Union and neighboring countries. One report described a crew of "little men” who were seen wandering around one of the collective farms during the night, picking up samples of the withered crops. Security guards surrounded the "men," but a saucer came down out of the sky, landed, and picked up the threatened party. It took off soon afterwards. Other reports described mysterious plane disappearances following UFO encounters.
WE HEAR that one of the district representatives for a saucer publication in the eastern portion of the United States is currently being confined in a mental institution, and rumors are circulating that he has suffered breakdowns on several previous occasions. We wish him a speedy recovery, so that he may help review more of the flying saucer evidence.
WE HEAR that interest in the Shaver Mystery was revived in a large city on the West Coast recently, when a number of people reported hearing mysterious voices in the night. A well-known occult researcher investigated these claims, and, in querying the unfortunate victims about the conversatlons they had heard, he learned the details of a large cave in Arizona that was supposed to house a Dero colony. The researcher equipped an expedition to the cave, and sent letters to several key personalities in the saucer field with admonitions that they were not to be opened unless he did not return. He then left for his trip.
%itnesses saw him enter the cave, and several minutes later they broke out in a cold sweat when they heard violent screams coming from its interior. The group was so frightened that they left without bothering to learn of the poor man’s fate. To this day, he has not been found.
To complicate this mystery, one of the parties who received a sealed envelope from the missing researcher, searched through his files, only to find a few scattered ashes where the envelope was originally placed!

about 280° reaching a zenith of 75° and disappeared near Procyon 
bearing 260°, altitude 65°.

This meteor appeared to be only a short distance ahead of the 
ship and illuminated the entire length of the vessel and surrounding sea area.

UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT

Time Sighted: Approximately 1700 to 1705, Date: 29 April 1953

Size: Approximately that of a F-80 fighter aircraft

Shape: Circular with no extension of control surfaces

Color: Metallic silver

Track of object: From north to east

Flight time observed: 60 seconds

At approximately 1700 the officer sources, enroute to FEAF from San Francisco on the USNS General A. W. Brewster, sighted an unidentified object approximately the size of an F-80 fighter aircraft, at 3 o'clock, altitude 2000 feet, and slightly below the clouds, at a distance of about ¼ mile. This object appeared to remain stationary for a few seconds, then turn at right angles towards the ship, gain altitude and travel in an arc to a position of 5 o'clock disappearing through the clouds aft of the ship.

The object did not perform with the smooth control movements of any known aircraft. Rather its controlled action were erratic with some turns at 90-degree angles and near vertical climbs. The movement from 3 to 5 o'clock was in an arc.

Position of the vessel at time of incident was Lat 28 degrees 14' N, Long 166 degrees 05' W.

Estimated speed of this object was in excess of a jet fighter aircraft.
