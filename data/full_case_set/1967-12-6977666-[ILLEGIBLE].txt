The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The text describes the observer's account of a UFO sighting, including details such as the UFO moving toward the observer, disappearing behind a church steeple, and coming out the other side moving faster. The sketch includes some labels or symbols, such as "Orion", "Foot", and "Tree", but it does not clearly depict any recognizable objects or scenes.

Now acting as an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

162 Jefferson St. 
Perth Amboy, New Jersey

Dear Sir,

I would like to report a sighting of a U.F.O. over Staten Island on the night of Friday, December 1. I am speaking for my club of which most of them saw this object. We (the club) were on the roof of the local Y.M.C.A. having a viewing session (our club is basically an astronomy club for younger boys) when 1 of the elder boys called to my attention an object over Staten Island much brighter than a star and 4 times as big, the color was an orange-red and it was in the shape of an circle. The object came from behind a church steeple and headed directly for us, then it made a 90 degree turn to the north. Then it headed straight on and disappeared in a group of smoke-stacks. Several people saw this including myself, and one of the boys saw this thru a telescope but lost it because of its rate of travel. We verify this to be the truth to the best of our knowledge and there is a diagram on the bottom of this page to show the path taken.

We would appreciate any help you can give us on our observations.

This case concerns a civilian who was requested to come to a military base. The informant states that he was driving and saw two blue lights in the sky. One object started to move very rapidly and disappeared. The other object stayed in the same area and seemed to be flashing lights. The informant could not determine the speed, size, or distance of the object.

This image appears to contain two sketches or illustrations related to a UFO sighting.

The first sketch shows a compass rose-like diagram with various cardinal and ordinal directions labeled. The instructions indicate that this diagram is meant to be used to indicate the direction of the observed UFO phenomenon.

The second sketch shows two landscape scenes. The larger scene depicts a person standing on a road or path between hills or mountains in the distance. The smaller scene shows a similar landscape with a suggestion of something in the sky.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

"9A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "0" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO 
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "O" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "O" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATELY THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN THE TWO POSITIONS. THEN INDICATE GRAPHICALLY ANY CHANGE IN THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON AS IT WAS OBSERVED, IE: LARGER, SMALLER OR THE SAME."

Dear sir,
This report refers to the case of August 5, 1957. on that day a Mrs. June Miller and one or those "saucer patrol" sighting wings were seen down at Lubbock. that occurred on December 12, 1957 at a little past 7:30 P.M. I was watching television. suddenly what seemed to be a jet passing over my house. it was so bright and so fast that at first I thought it was just a jet, but I then noticed it seemed to remain stationary over my house. I thought it was a planet, but it seemed to be over the house and suddenly the lights on the south porch and in the house went out. I looked all around and could see the darned thing to the southwest. I noticed it seemed to be maneuvering. all of a sudden the lights came back on and the thing disappeared. the next day I heard about the sighting at Lubbock and I know about it. if you can tell me about what this could have been, I would appreciate it.

At approximately 6:30 PM EST this day I sighted what is termed a flying saucer at approximately a 130' angle in the sky. It was about the size of a quarter but when spied through 4x10 binoculars it appeared cigar shaped approximately one foot long and seemed to give off a glow very unlike a star. It remained in the sky for about 20 minutes and then disappeared behind some trees. Can you tell me what it was?

It hovered for a short time, then began moving slowly at first, then more rapidly toward the north star. First it looked bright, then faded to a dull reddish glow as it moved farther away.
