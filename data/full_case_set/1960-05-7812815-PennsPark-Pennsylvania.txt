Preliminary analysis of the possible cause of the sighting indicates two possibilities: (1) Jet exhaust and (2) reflection of the sun. Information indicates that the observer may have seen jet exhaust of an aircraft eliminating either entering or going away from the Philadelphia area as a possible cause. The other possibility was a reflection of the sun on some object, possibly a searchlight shining in the Philadelphia area approximately the time of the sighting, but did not this time over the observer, it is felt that the circular reflection of the sun's rays lower that over the observer, it is felt that the circular.
