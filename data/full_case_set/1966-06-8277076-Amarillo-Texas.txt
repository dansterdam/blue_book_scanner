The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a form filled out as part of Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The form provides details about a sighting that occurred in Amarillo, Texas on June 6, 1966. The form includes information such as the date, location, number of objects observed, length of observation, type of observation, and a brief summary and analysis. The conclusion indicates that the sighting was a "Possible (SATELLITE)".

The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains a form with questions about a UFO sighting, but there is no photograph included in this particular page.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes - No - Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The image contains a sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The sketch depicts an instruction or questionnaire for observers to fill out regarding their sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). It contains a horizon line with markings indicating the altitude of the observed object, as well as a compass-like diagram for indicating the direction of the object. There are also instructions for the observer to draw the motion and direction of the observed object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
