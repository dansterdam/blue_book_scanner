The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report from Project Blue Book, describing an incident involving two sergeants working in the VYA-212 Operations Office in Korea on June 22, 1952.

The text of the document is as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: ATIL Office, D/I FEAF
REPORT NO: IR-22-52
PAGE: 1 OF 2

The two (2) sergeants working in the VYA-212 Operations Office, reported sighting an object, approximately four (4) feet in width, at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet above the ground, just above the K-2 airstrip in Korea.

The object was first sighted approximately four (4) feet in width, was first spotted at an angle of 45 degrees, traveling from the north to the south at an estimated speed of 200 - 300 knots. The object was described as circular in shape, silvery in color, and orange in color, at 2215, 22 June 1952. 

As the object passed directly overhead, the sergeants stated that it came to a complete stop, and then proceeded in a straight line for a distance of approximately 1,000 feet above the west end of the airstrip. During this maneuver, the object was observed to oscillate (four to five) times, one-fourth (1/4) mile, (two to three seconds elapsed during this maneuver), where it then proceeded on its original course.

The object then proceeded to make a 180 degree turn to the right, spending about 45 to 60 seconds in the turn. As the object completed the turn, it began a climbing spiral, gaining altitude, and was noticed, followed by complete darkness.

The two observers stated that during the period of the sudden darkness, the object could not be seen. No sound was audible, and during the entire sequence of maneuvers, no sounds were apparent.

Comments by Originating Preparing Officer (1st Lt. Walter H. Polak, Intelligence Officer):

As a result of combined and individual interrogation of the two (2) enlisted men concerned, the following is submitted:

The Marine Air Group Aerology Officer revealed that meteorological conditions prevailing, there was no ceiling or visibility prevailing at the time spotted, and no explanation could be given. The period of the visual sighting would give added credence to the actual phenomenon observed.

Marine Aircraft Group Aerology reports the weather during this period as follows:
Temperature: 71 Degrees
Wind: 4/19 at Cl	25,000 feet
Ceiling:
Visibility: 6-10 miles

STATEMENT OF STAFF SERGEANT "A" P. MOORE CONCERNING FLYING MISSILES:
At approximately 2215/8 Sgt. KENNER and I were returning from the marshall being located down on the west end of the run way when we spotted a strange light about four (4) feet in diameter. It seemed to be hovering and coming down. It then shot back up to about 1,000 feet and then shot straight down again to about 200 feet, The object was inclined at an angle and was coming down tail first. It then straightened out and started coming down straight. As it was coming down, it shot out several large blue flashes of light. The object then went into some trees and we lost sight of it. The whole experience lasted about 30 seconds. At one time the object seemed to be about 1,000 feet from us.
Also Sergeant KENNER and I stopped the jeep we were in when we first saw it and got out to watch it. The object appeared to be about the size of a basketball at the distance we observed it.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS REPORTING (SHORT TITLE: FLYOBJRPT)
MIDDLE TOWN, PA.

John L. Briggs, 23 Lt, USAF, civilian observer

Air Force Letter No. 200-5, 23 Apr 52

Mrs. P. a group of Hagerstown R.D. #1, Pa., reported an observation of a group of strange lights in the sky while at a drive-in theater at Greencastle, Pa. 

The observation was made between 0230Z and 0330Z hours on 20 June 1952.

The observer described the lights as being strange in appearance and not resembling those of an aircraft.

This Office believes that the lights may have been a reflection of some sort of lights located approximately fourteen miles west of the location of the observation. However, this report is forwarded because of the many alleged sightings of flying objects in this area of late.

These so-called sightings may have been stimulated by the recent newspaper publicity on the subject.

(NOTE: This office was advised by Captain Ruppelt, ATIC Project Officer, that to confirm or deny any speculation concerning this incident would be inadvisable.)

Transcription of the text in the document:

b. Upon looking more directly overhead in the Eastern sky, Captain observed what he at first believed to be a meteor but almost immediately realized was not a meteor. This object appeared to be approximately (2) or three (3) times the size of a star of average brightness and seemed to be very rapidly traversing across the sky. The object was seen to stop and hover for a short period and then to proceed in a southeasterly direction at a very rapid rate of speed. This object appeared to be a "trophy" or steady glow, was not a meteor. 
This object appeared to be approximately 8,000 to 10,000 feet, however, he made no attempt to estimate the height at which object appeared would be from 8,000 to 10,000 feet.
After the first (2) or three (3) minutes, the source notified his wife and mother-in-law to observe the object and went into his apartment to call the Operations Officer on duty as the Officer ACAY Squadron to determine if any unidentified objects appeared on the radar screen. The source was instructed to continue to observe the object and was told that the object had moved rather swiftly on a horizontal to the north and disappeared at approximately 2230 hours local time.
c. At approximately 2245 hours local time Captain observed a point of light which he believed to be the object he had previously observed. The object was hovering at an apparently fixed position. Captain attempted to obtain a picture of object, using a Retina E camera with a 50 mm lens, giving (2) second exposure. This exposure was not successful in obtaining a picture of the object, which appeared to be a point of light and no further details could be observed. Captain waited some minutes, hoping the object would reappear, but it did not.

STATEMENT

At approximately 2220 hours on 21 June 1952, while walking in a field near Erdim, Germany, an observer was looking at the stars and pointing out the Big Dipper constellation, and the location of the North Star. On looking more directly overhead, I momentarily thought I saw a meteor but then realized this was not a burning object, but was a star-like object (pale white) round in shape.

It was below the stars, but close to the horizon, and was moving very slowly and steadily in a northeast direction. It did not appear to be burning or glowing and was steady rather than flickering, as a meteor would. I watched it for about 2 minutes, during which time it appeared to change brightness slightly, becoming brighter at times. 

It was about 3/4 the size of the North Star and was at the same altitude or slightly below. This light came from the direction of the north and appeared to be heading in a northeast direction. It maintained an even speed and altitude throughout the observation.

At this point I left a companion and telephoned the USAF base nearby, asking him to look out for any unusual objects in the sky. He saw nothing at that time.

At 2225, as I took another look, the object had disappeared. I waited and looked again, but it did not reappear.

As this was an unusually clear night, it was an unusual sighting. It was an extremely bright, star-like object, round in shape, pale white in color, and did not appear to be burning or glowing, nor was there any sound heard. There was no Moon or clouds in the sky at the time of the sighting.

I have no other explanation for this object, as it did not resemble any known aircraft, balloon, or astronomical object. The observation was 2 to 3 minutes in duration.

The text in the document appears to be detailed notes or observations related to some kind of investigation or report. However, as per the instructions, I will not identify or name any individuals mentioned in the text, but will simply transcribe the written content as an OCR system would.

TRANSCRIPTION:

Can concentrate on the large light at the end (apparent at least 15 miles off). This large light was separated into 2 somewhat distinct source segments which appeared to give off light separately from one another. This large light appeared to be 2 distinct sources of light which were in apparent close proximity to each other. Some smaller lights were observed nearby but it appeared that the main intensity was concentrated in the 2 separate light sources. This main double light appeared to be larger than a star but smaller than the moon. As the observers watched, the double light sources appeared to dim, then become brighter, and this sequence seemed to repeat itself several times before the light finally disappeared. No sound was heard in connection with the observation. The total duration of the sighting was around 30 minutes.

STATEMENT

On the evening of June 21, 1952, my son-in-law and my daughter returning home from the picture show. It was about 10:20 p.m. The night was unusually clear and they observed an object in the northwest sky, which appeared to be about the size of a baseball held at arm's length. At first it appeared to be very bright, bright as a star. As it came closer, it appeared to get even brighter and seemed to be changing colors. It was a steady light, not blinking. As it approached, it slowed down and seemed to go into a downward direction. It moved in a somewhat zigzag fashion, but generally in a downward direction. It seemed to be about 20 minutes in the air, until it disappeared from sight. My son-in-law said he had never seen anything like it before. He had a good look at it for about 10 minutes probably, probably 8 or 10 minutes. When we first noticed this bright object, it was almost overhead. As it came closer it appeared to be descending, and I judged it was perhaps 300 yards or less from us. The object then went behind some trees and the light grew dimmer until it was out of sight.

STATEMENT

On Saturday night the 21st of June 1952 at about 10:20 P.M. while walking home from the Depot Theater with my mother (Mrs. Benedict) she and I both noticed a peculiar light in the eastern sky. It was easily noticeable because of its strange movements and rapidity of motion. When first seen it appeared to be bouncing around in the sky, moving very quickly in one direction and then another.

After watching for what seemed to be about 5 minutes it suddenly disappeared. It was only visible for a short Lapse of time, which appeared to be climbing, and then it disappeared completely. We watched it for about 3 minutes in all. I could not get a good look at it as it was moving so rapidly. It appeared to be larger than a star and give off a peculiar glow. The motion was so rapid that it was noticeably larger than any star and so light as to remain visible in a dark sky. It seemed to be noticeably larger than one would expect a star to appear to be at that distance and to still remain visible. What it was I am at a loss to explain, but I am quite certain that the motion could not have been caused by any known aircraft, and feel sure that the motion could not have been caused by the wind.

UFOs and the Opposition of Mars
Venus is not the only heavenly body to stimulate a flying saucer. Jupiter and even Mercury, the smallest of the planets, have inspired their share of UFOs. Mars, which can also be very bright, has frequently been reported as a spaceship.
On June 28, 1952, an F-47 aircraft was on routine patrol over the Atomic Energy Commission installation at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, when the pilot observed a slow-moving craft was moving in the area where the pilot observed a blinding white light. At about the same time the pilot observed a trail, apparently making passes at him. For the next eighteen min-

The image contains a photograph that appears to be part of a document from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The photograph is titled "FINAL GALLEY PROOF" and describes an incident involving a pilot who sighted an unidentified flying object at 15,000 feet, moving at about 250 knots. The document provides details about the pilot's experience and the subsequent investigation by officials.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

Galley 33-THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
The pilot used visual to intercept the unknown. The plane was at 15,000 feet, moving at about 250 knots. As the pilot turned to meet the pass, the UFO would pull up some 2500 feet above the plane and then move in again. When the plane reached 22,000 feet, the UFO appeared to make a final dive down to 7000 feet, then disappeared. The pilot's reaction in indicated by his answer to one of the routine questions on "piloting the sighting": Did you stop at any time? His reply read: "He' did not".
The pilot's interviews, it is indicated, led officials to ATIC at first suspected that the object might have been a balloon, released as a hoax; only a few weeks earlier, a crane-like had launched a flight of balloons near Oak Ridge and had been caught. But after interviewing the witnesses, the investigators concluded that the UFO was far more probable reply to the pilot's report, "Did you stop at any time?" His reply read: "He' did not".

Dear Colonel Bower:

A further investigation of the incident referred to in your teletype of June 29, 1952 concerning the sighting of a lighted 100 gram pilot balloon with an ascent rate of about 1000 ft./min. which was released at 22:00 EST June 20, (210302) from the Loukes-Tyson Airport near Knoxville. This balloon was observed for 15 minutes at which time the lighting united. The 0902 radiosonde balloon from Nashville was followed presumably by an AST 658, to an altitude of 25,000 ft. No winds above 25,000 ft. were reported by this flight.

The 210302Z wind data from this area are as follows:

Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (FLYOBRPT)

DESCRIPTION:
An intense blue-green light was seen traveling at a high rate of speed at an altitude of about 40,000 feet. The light was traveling in a south-easterly direction as a line "between Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Wellington, Colorado, towards Limon, Colorado, nearly 150 miles." 

The source of the light could not be determined. No objects of any shape or form were observed. The blue-green lights seemed to be a high frequency flash at a distance. These flashes occurred at irregular intervals and without a definite line of flight, as sound could have provided, and any type of propulsion was not discernible.

TIME:
0800 The time described above was observed on 22 June 1958, at about 0615 Mountain Standard Time.  Due to the daylight fact of the place as which the object was sighted, the sighting duration was relatively short.

MANNER OF OBSERVATION:
This sighting was visual, by trained observers, who were the only observers at the time of the sighting. The object was seen for a short period, and it was observed to work at the same time, with no sound or electrical or electronic equipment used in conjunction with the observation.

Mr. [REDACTED] has been a night watchman in the area for 12 years, and is thoroughly familiar with aircraft and other objects in the sky. During the course of his years of employment, he has observed numerous phenomena, but states that this is the first time he has ever observed this type of object.

WEATHER

The weather conditions for the time of observation were as follows:
The weather was clear, visibility fifteen miles. Wind 3 knots. Barometric pressure 30.11 inches and temperature 52 degrees. There were no clouds affectin the report.

EVIDENCE

There is no physical evidence to this report. Due to the fact that the operation was actually based solely on the observation of one witness. Lack of more definite identifying features of the object precludes this report being substantiated definitely for information and as a record of sighting.

Utilization: G. Qlapha
June 24, 1952

Intelligence Officer
United States Air Force
Tinker Field Air base
Oklahoma City, Okla.

Dear Sir:

I should like to report the sighting of an unusual aerial object which occurred on the evening of June 22, 1952 between 7:00 and 8:30 p.m.

I was pointing out the stars of Ursa Minor when the object first came into view. It was silently and slowly circling the area, which led me to believe it was either a helicopter or a small private plane. It was about as plainly visible as a star on a clear night, although brighter. The motion and maneuvering of the object were most unusual. It would fly for a while in a straight line, then suddenly dart off at a sharp angle, change directions, and come back to almost the same spot from which it started. This was repeated several times in the course of about 10 minutes. The object then left the area, with a sudden burst of speed, and I lost sight of it. The entire observation lasted around 15-20 minutes.

The object first came from the southwest, then circled to the west, north and back to the southwest, finally going out of sight in a northerly direction. In maneuvering, it gave the impression of having complete control and of being intelligently guided. Its size was difficult to determine, but it appeared to be a fairly small object, perhaps the size of a large plane. The color was a very bright, metallic-like white, which caught the eye immediately. It left no trail or exhaust of any kind. The illumination was constant and steady, with no blinking or flashing. 

I am enclosing a sketch of the object and the path it followed. The object was first observed at about 7:15 p.m. and disappeared from sight about 7:30 p.m. There was no noise heard.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch that appears to be a diagram or illustration related to a UFO sighting or incident. The sketch depicts a luminous object in the sky, along with some annotations and labels. There is no photograph in this particular page of the document.

Regarding the text, the OCR output is as follows:

My wife and I have collected decrease. I have been on the teaching staff of St. Olaf's College and am now employed in one of the research laboratories. I must ask you to keep this strictly confidential, as it must not be revealed for at least 5 years else I will lose my position. You should not destroy this report as we have tested this and have found it is nearly impossible to avoid any deception. I cannot identify the exact location as I wish to avoid any publicity. It was a very unusual night.

Your truly yours.

The image does not contain a photograph, only handwritten text on a form. The text describes the sighting of two "AF officers" who were fishing on the Patuxent River, and observed a "white cigar-shaped object" that was obscured by greenish-white trails.

21. In your own words please describe the sighting you observed.  Use sketches if desired.  All observations from the time of first sighting to the time of disappearance are important. Include a description of the weather, wind, and cloud conditions at the time of this sighting.

ATIC Comment: Probably astronautical. Dr Hynek should be able to help on this. Data is sketchy and we probably can't get any more without a great deal of trouble.
