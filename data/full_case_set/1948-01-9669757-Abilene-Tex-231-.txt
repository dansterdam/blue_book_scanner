Incident #231 -- Abilene, Texas -- 1 January 1948

This incident has no astronomical explanation.

The fan-shaped glow that extended momentarily from the
horizon to the zenith suggests a maze-made disturbance -- electrical
or explosive. The green color is the only characteristic that
might connect this incident with the "new Mexico green fireballs",
the rest of the description does not.

```
Incident: 231

Information regarding this sighting taken from a letter of ****
addressed to Air **** at Abilene, Texas, in regard 
to Mr. **** inquiry regarding a phenomena he witnessed the 
night of 1 Jan 48 at approximately 2125 A. M. and again at 1:30 
A. M.

Object was described as a fan-shaped glow which originated from a 
large ball on the horizon and which extended to the meridian due 
west of Abilene, Texas, in a perfectly clear sky. Phenomena was 
of 2 seconds duration. Five minutes later it was seen again for 
the same length of time. No sound was heard.

Mr. **** thought the phenomena could possibly be attributed to:

    (1) Disturbance of an electrical system such as transformers 
    blowing out, or

    (2) Experiments at White Sands Proving Grounds which are due 
    west of Abilene.

NOTE: Inquiry at Holloman AF Base, Alamogordo, N. M., 
revealed that research work at night and on 
Sundays does not involve the use of any lighting 
devices or flares such as described in the various 
reports submitted. See Incidents 

See Incident "233" ****

Dear ------------- 

          The brilliant blue-green glow which you report as seen
as west of you at 1:25 A. M. and again at 1:30 A.M., January 1st, could
hardly be any kind of astronomical phenomena that I know of.

          I am more inclined to think that it was either (1) some
sort of disturbance of an electrical system such as transformers blowing
out, or (2) experiments at the White Sands Proving Grounds which I believe
are easily in that direction from you.

          I am sending a copy of this letter to Dr. ------------
of the University of New Mexico at Albuquergue and if he is not under any
restriction as to military secrets, perhaps he can tell us whether possibility
number 2 applies. As to possibility number 1, ------------ of the
Abilene, connected with the West Texas Utility Company, ought to be able
to find out for us whether there was any kind of electrical trouble which I
doubt could have been more than 10 or 15 miles away.

          I note you say that the glow seemed to be fan shaped,
originating from a large ball on the horizon, extending to the meridian, due
west of you in a perfectly clear sky lasting about two seconds each and
extremely bright blue-green; also, that you heard no sound.

                                 Yours sincerely,

TO Commanding General
     Air Material Command
     Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
     Dayton, Ohio
     ATTN: MC/IXO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MC/IX, 
dated 19 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and 
endorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The Incident Summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is reccommended that the "Guide To Investigation Of Un-
identified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Direction
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is
specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Spotting" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.

Dear Mr.

     The brilliant blue-green glow which you report as seen

hardly be any kind of astronomical phenomena that I know of.

     I am more inclined to think that it was either (1) some 
sort of disturbance of an electrical system such as transformers blowing
out; or, (2) experiments at the White Sands Proving Grounds which I believe
are usually in that direction from you.

     I am sending a copy of this letter to Dr. , 
of the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque and if he is not under any 
restriction as to military secrets, perhaps he can tell us whether possibility
number 2 applies. As to possibility number 1, someone right there in
Abilene, connected with the West Texas Utility Company, ought to be able to
find out for me whether there was any kind of electrical trouble which 
could have been no more than 10 or 15 miles away.

     I note you say that this glow seemed to be fan shaped, 
originating from a large bell on the horizon, ascending to the meridian, in a 
west of you in a perfectly clear sky lasting about two seconds each and 
extremely bright blue green; also, that you heard no sound.
