The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, describing a sighting of "Sight Objects In Sky" by residents of the Ramey Home in Ashland, Kentucky.

Ramey Home Residents
Sight 'Objects In Sky'
The second sighting of "objects" was reported to the police in Ashland, Ky., by Miss Gertrude Ramey, founder and superintendent of the Ramey Home, a home for the aged.
Miss Ramey said the objects, which appeared about 10 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 5, looked like silver stars and "could keep her inside most of the night for they kept appearing and disappearing."
Miss Effingham, who said she watches for any unusual objects in the sky, said the objects stayed silvery in color and in formations of about three times. She said they would disappear from sight and then reappear. The children here saw them too, she said.
The home's board of directors said Miss Effingham and Miss Ramey saw "what appeared to be several 'shooting stars' during their sighting from the Ramey Home."
Is beautiful, you know? The moon was full and there was practically no wind, she said. The three hours Sunday night were spent watching for the objects. They seemed to come from the southeast, stay awhile and then leave by going in a southwest direction, she said.
There may be some explanation, but it still remains a mystery about what the objects were and why they were there, she said.

If you have any information on UFO's send it to me and I'll try to help. My friend and I were in my yard the other night when we saw a light over the farm. We watched it for a while. It seemed to just hover, then moved slowly and erratically. I'd like to get up a sighting report if I can. Have you had any other UFO sightings in this area? Let me know what you think.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from a document, which looks like it is part of Project Blue Book, a US Air Force study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document contains a checklist of various UFO-related phenomena, with checkboxes indicating whether the phenomenon was observed or not. At the bottom of the document, there are two questions asking for more details about how the observed phenomenon "finally disappeared" and what the witness saw in front of them.

The text in the document is as follows:

DID THE PHENOMENON
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE? YES
STAND STILL FOR A PERIOD? YES
MAKE ANY SOUND? YES
CHANGE SHAPE OR SIZE? YES
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR? YES
FLUTTERED OR BOBBLE? YES

We were looking for that thing moving through the sky until it disappeared.

Re: TELETYPE (UFOS)

Dear Sir:

Reference your inquiry dated January 2, 1968, concerning any information this department might have relative to a reported UFO sighting in this area the same night. The enclosed newspaper clippings contain about the same type of reports this department received on that particular night.

For your information, this department has not received any other reports since that time concerning people who saw anything unusual in the skies.

Hoping this will be of assistance to you in your investigation, I remain.

P.O. BOX 311, ASHLAND, KY. 41101 MONDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 27, 1967

Police Officer
Sees Flying
Saucers

Police in Ashland have for years been receiving calls about "flying saucers" being seen over Ashland. However, one officer said today that she actually saw them herself last Sunday night.

Mrs. Sally Curley, who resides at 4337 Greenleaf Drive, told police that at about 8:45 p.m. Sunday she and her husband were outside their home and observed two flying objects in the sky. She said the objects were saucer-shaped and glistening, and seemed to be coming toward them. She said she watched them for about 15 minutes.

Mrs. Curley, who is a policewoman, said she has been hearing about the "flying saucers" for years, but this was the first time she had actually seen them herself. She said the objects seemed to be flying erratic maneuvers, and would suddenly stop and hover, then dart off in another direction.

Mrs. Curley said she called the Ashland police station and reported what she had seen, but the dispatcher said there had been no other reports of "flying saucers" that night.

Ramey Home Residents
Sight 'Objects In Sky'
The second sighting of "un-identified flying objects" over the Ramey Home neighborhood in Ashland was reported Sunday night.

Mrs. J. B. Ramey, resident and superintendent of the Ramey Home, said the "things" were sighted by several residents at the home.

The "things," described as silver-colored, moved rapidly through the sky and at times seemed to hover. Mrs. Ramey said the objects came about 8:40 p.m. and that the sighting lasted about 15 minutes.

Mrs. Ramey said residents at the Ashland Community College also had reported the same incident. The objects were also identified by some as "flying saucers."

However, Mrs. Ramey said the objects were not hue saucers, but seemed more like smaller round or oval shapes. She said the objects made no sound.

The children have a large telescope at the home and tried to get a closer look at the objects, which appeared to flash brightly at times, Mrs. Ramey said.

The ABC investigator in Ashland said he had received some reports of the incidents, but no one seemed to have gotten any photographs.

P. O. BOX 311, ASHLAND, KY., 41101 MONDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 27, 1967

Police Officer Sees Flying Saucers

Police officers in Ashland calls about unidentified flying objects seen over different areas of the city.

"I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself," said his co-worker, patrolling with him at the time.

"And I wasn't seeing things either," the officer stated. "They were real."

Ramey Home Residents Sight 'Objects In Sky'

Many persons were reported to have seen unidentified objects in the sky over the Ramey Home.

"They were very bright, silver in color and much bigger than stars," said residents there. One resident described the objects as being about the size of a dime when held at arm's length. 

Miss Effingham, a student, said the objects were seen by other youngsters at the home.

She said they were visible about 7 p.m. and remained in sight for about 45 minutes to an hour.

The ACC sophomore said there were many witnesses who saw the objects but they were too high and too fast for anyone to get a good look at them through binoculars.

(Continued on Page 12, Column 1)

Ramey Home Residents
(Continued from Page 1)

She said the phenomena was sighted on two successive evenings this past week.
 
Ashland Police Chief Donald McCullough said his department received many calls about the sightings. He said, "If they land a saucer in my backyard, I'll be the first to run out and see it, though." The McCullough home is near the Ramey Home.

Miss Effingham, who said she and others watched the objects through binoculars, described them as being round, silver and much larger than any known aircraft or satellites.

She said they seemed to be going in and out of the sky at high speeds. The objects were seen by a group and would disappear and reappear.

"At first I thought it was an airplane," she said, "but it just wasn't."

The ACC sophomore said the only sound made by the objects was a faint hum.

She said they seemed to hover and maneuver in the sky. The objects, she said, would suddenly move and then stop.

"They just seemed to defy all the laws of gravity," Miss Effingham said.

ASHLAND (KY.) DAILY INDEPENDENT WEDNESDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 6, 1967

Additional Sightings Of UFOs Reported Today

(Additional sightings of "unidentified flying objects" were reported today to the Independent, with one local woman saying she saw one over the South Ashland area.)

Mrs. Catherine Salyer, who lives at 25th and Oakview, said she saw a bright light in the sky Monday night which she at first thought was a shooting star, but which after a few seconds seemed to move in a zig-zag fashion and at a high rate of speed.

The Police Department reported that a "brightly-lit object" was also reported in the South Ashland area.

Mrs. Mattie Flatwoods, said she saw what she described as a "ring of light" over her home on Oakview Drive in the South Ashland area.

She said the object appeared and disappeared several times Monday night.

Mrs. Flatwoods said her son-in-law, George Flatwoods, also observed the object and told his wife, who reported the first sighting to police.

The Flatwoods said their 11-year-old grandson, who was watching television Monday night, also saw the object in the sky.

The Police Department said several other persons reported seeing "unusual lights" in the sky Monday night.

There were no reports of any landings or physical objects found.
