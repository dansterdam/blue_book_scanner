There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing text describing a UFO sighting.

The text reads as follows:

On the night of August, on a clear night in August of 1959 my mother-in-law and I were on our way up the hill behind the school in Coeburn, Virginia from about 8:00 p.m. to about 10:30 p.m. When we first got there we parked and I got out of the car and looked around the sky. I saw a few stars and there was no moon. At about 8:30 p.m. I saw a large object come up over Sheeprpck Mountain followed in a few seconds by two more of the objects. They were moving at a very slow speed. The objects were about twice as bright as the largest star on a clear night. They rose steadily and began to follow the top of the mountain ridge. At one time the two of the objects got below the mountain on my side or the mountain. Then they went back to join the other object and traveled on down the mountain ridge. As I have already said, I left the scene before they were completely out of sight. I took the picture at about 9:00 p.m. when the objects were all over the top of the mountain. I used a Brownie camera.

- page 6 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing an encounter with an unidentified flying object.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"I made 35 mm. camera (Kalimar A ) and regular black and white film. I did not use any flash or telephoto lens or any kind of special equipment. When I got the roll of films back from the developer I found that a print had not been made of the negative so I had an enlargement made of it and discovered that the objects had come out on it. So I reported it to the Air Force.

The photographer who did the enlargement for me said that the Air Force was supposed to pay me at least $100 for the pictures and negatives any Unidentified Flying Object that was sent to them. I hope this is true.

Thank You,"

The image appears to be a diagram or schematic of a celestial hemisphere, displaying various angular measurements and directions. The diagram shows a circular grid with degrees marked along the circumference, representing the azimuth or horizontal angle. The center of the circle is marked as the zenith, indicating the highest point in the sky. This type of diagram is commonly used to visualize and analyze the positions and movements of celestial objects.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

90Â° Zenith
135 SE
90 E
45 NE
315 NW
180 S 0 N

SUBJECT: UFO Photograph - Coeburn, Va. (

TO: SAFOI-3D (Major L. J. Tucker)

1. The attached negative was forwarded to ATIC by Mr. who claims the photograph is that of an unidentified flying object, and was taken by him in Coeburn, Va. during August 1959.

2. The ATIC analysis of the film is that the spots are "air balls" and that they appear to be either out-of-focus scattered light, or due to some defect in the film during developing and preventing small areas from being reached by the developer.

3. Mr. stated in his letter that he has been informed that the Air Force pays $100.00 for photographs of UFO's. This is, of course, not true, and it is suggested that this information be included in your reply.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

13 February 1960

I am returning herewith the negative you forwarded recently for the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center taken at Coburn, Virginia in August 1959.

The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center analysis of the film is that the spots are "air bella" and that the wispy image is either out-of-focus or due to poor developing techniques. Air bells result from bubbles forming around the film during developing and preventing small areas from being exposed.

For your information, the Air Force does not pay for photographs of UFO's.

The image contains a black and white photograph showing a landscape or skyline view. The image is dated "August 1959 Coeburn, Virginia" at the top. There are no clearly identifiable objects or structures in the image, which appears to be a largely featureless, hazy or blurry landscape or skyscape. There are a few small dark spots or markings visible, but no discernible details or shapes that would suggest the presence of any specific objects or phenomena.

I have a very interesting photograph that I took in Coeburn, Virginia last summer. I just recently had it developed and an enlargement made of it. It has some very interesting objects on it. I believe them to be UFO's as there were many seen in this area of the country last summer and as far as I know they are still being seen. There are three of them on the photograph, one of which is very large. I also know that there was a check made of them during the summer of 1959 by Secret Service agents. I also know that SAC dropped some strips of aluminum over the area in 1959 to jam the Navy's radar station on Black Mountain near Coeburn.

If you are interested in the photograph please let me know as soon as possible! I think that with further processing this photo would be very valuable to your files.

Yours truly,
