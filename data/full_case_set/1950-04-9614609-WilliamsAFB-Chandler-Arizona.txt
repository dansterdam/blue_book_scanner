PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: April 9 1950 1855Z
2. LOCATION: Williams AFB, Chandler, Arizona
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 Seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-visual
7. COURSE: North
8. PHOTOS: None
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: Astro (METEOR)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The witness saw a meteor, one of the rare daylight sightings of this type. The object showed sharp outlines, almost similar to horizon at North. The object moved at constant velocity far greater than the reported 1,200 mph.
COMMENTS: The fact that this was a daylight observation probably accounts for the precision in describing the position and motion, which can be seen just as easily as the moon or visible planets. The magnitudes of these meteors is as bright or brighter than 3 magnitudes, which makes them very noticeable during daylight.

Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

As 12 o'clock high and in a ruler straight line to the horizon. To flutter or deviation whatsoever, such as with weather balloons, etc.

IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension: Immeasible

How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand:
The objects listed are: Head of a pin, Pea, Dime, Nickel, Grapefruit, Silver dollar, Baseball, Basketball, Other

Circle One: 
(C) certain
(b) Fairly certain 
(c) Not vary sure
(d) Uncertain

How did the object or objects disappear from view? Over the horizon with roof tops in the foreground.

In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object or objects which you saw. Of what type material would you make it, how large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. A balloon or either a small ball would be stmilar.

After bringing the wife's attention to the object (she was sewing with a machine on a table in our back yard) I called the weather office at Williams AFB and they did not release a balloon that day. They did venture an opinion that Davie-Monthan AFB (to the South about 80 miles) did not release one that Saturday.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and asks the viewer to imagine that they are at the point shown. The viewer is then instructed to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when they first saw it, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when they last saw it.

The second sketch contains two smaller sketches. The larger one shows a road or path leading to a town or city in the distance, with a person standing in the foreground. The smaller sketch shows a circular view with mountains or hills in the background.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the text:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

34.1 CLOUDS (Circle One): Clear, Hazy, Scattered clouds, Thick or heavy clouds, Don't remember
34.2 WIND (Circle One): No wind, Slight breeze, Strong wind, Don't remember

37.1 IF YOU ANSWERED NO, THEN WHEN, WHERE, AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES DID YOU SEE OTHER ONES?

38. IN YOUR OPINION WHAT DO YOU THINK THE OBJECT WAS AND WHAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED IT?
It could have been a balloon. BUT IT DID NOT SINK with wind currents and its speed was fantastic. Went from 12 o'clock high to the horizon in less time than it takes to read this. The T-33's flying around to the east gave a good comparison. This object was obviously three times as fast.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be an Air Force Technical Information Sheet that includes a written description of a sighting of an unidentified flying object.

The text in the document is as follows:

I was sun bathing and stretched out on an Army cot looking straight up (90Â°) in bright sunlight, but with the sun well out of my vision to the rear (South) thus, looking down or to the horizon I was looking directly North. The object was traveling from South to North and on first catching it in view I immediately brought it to the attention of my wife who looked up and we then both watched it disappear most rapidly to the horizon. But for its fantastic speed the object could very well been a balloon.

OCR TEXT OUTPUT:

UFO SIGHTING (Capt. Gruickshanks) 

TO: SAFIS-3, Attn: Maj. L. J. Tacker

FROM: AFOIN-4E

COMMENTS (For reverse, if necessary):

1. Search of the Air Technical Intelligence Center* reveals that on all Saturdays in April 1950, failed to reveal that Captain Gruickshanks made a report of a sighting which occurred during this period. 

2. Analysis of the information submitted by Captain Gruickshanks leads to the conclusion that the object of his sighting was a meteor (a fireball).

3. Daylight sightings of meteors are relatively rare; however, the magnitude of Captain Gruickshanks' sighting (seen from 35 or more miles away) are visible in daylight so plausible. 

4. The object of Captain Gruickshanks' sighting traversed approximately 90 degrees in the sky in 10 seconds, indicating a very high velocity. This is obviously great distance from the observer, results in a much higher velocity than would normally be attributed to the 25 miles per minute velocity of a typical meteor, or 1700 miles per hour. However, according to the object, the linear velocity of this meteor is approximately 18,000 to 20,000 miles per hour which is consistent with a meteor.

The image provided does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a scanned page from a document that contains only text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

9,000 to 10,000 knots. Assuming the observer's time estimate to be accurate, the object was obviously moving even faster. As the observer's line of sight (the angle between) moved from 50 degrees to this direction, the further removed from 50 degrees to this direction became the object's path, and an equal angle must have subtended even this path.

Here is the text from the document, produced as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) output:

Aircraft. Balloons. Airships, etc. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS "DISC SHAPED" THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT FIVE FEET IN DIAMETER

Other:

Evaluation of Source Reliability: AIR FORCE COMMAND OPINION

Analysis and Conclusions:
THE FACT THAT THIS WAS A CAREFULLY OBSERVED PROBABLY ACCOUNTS FOR THE RELIABILITY OF THIS WITNESS. MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS BEING A GENUINE EXAMPLE OF A DISC TYPE CRAFT. THE OBSERVERS SOUND AS THOUGH THEY WERE INTERESTED IN AND FAMILIAR WITH THE APPEARANCE OF COMMON AERIAL OBJECTS. HOWEVER, THEIR DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT SEEMS TO BE JUST AN ORDINARY WANING DISC TYPE WHICH IS OBSERVABLE IN DAYLIGHT. THE MEANS OF THESE OBJECTS IS STILL OBSCURT AND DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN A SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION CAN NOT BE REACHED AT THE PRESENT TIME.
