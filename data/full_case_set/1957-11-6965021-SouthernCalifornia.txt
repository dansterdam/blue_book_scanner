ASTRONOMY
Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the brightest object in the sky next to the sun, will continue to be a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the planet Jupiter.
By JAMES STOKLEY
THAT MARVELOUS star-like object in the southwestern sky these evenings is certainly Venus. That brilliant object, rivaling only the stars and the moon in brilliance, is the planet Venus.
What you see is the planet Venus, now shining at its maximum brightness. This is the time of year when Venus is at its best. At this season, Venus is at its greatest brilliance, far outshining any other star or planet. It is in fact one of the brightest objects in the sky, second only to the sun and moon.
If you look at Venus in the sky, you will see that it is very much brighter than any other star or planet. The reason for this is that Venus is relatively close to the earth - about 25 million miles at this time - and the side of Venus which faces the earth is fully illuminated by the sun. This brilliance makes Venus a conspicuous object, truly the "morning star" or "evening star."
Because of its early setting, Venus does not shine very long after sunset. If you watch carefully, you will see it dwindle in brightness as the evening hours go by, until it finally sets. At the time of greatest brilliance, Venus is setting about three hours after the sun.
A little later, Jupiter will join Venus in the southwestern sky. Jupiter is now rising about an hour after sunset and will become an increasingly prominent object in the evening sky.
These major planets, the brightest objects in the sky after the sun and moon, will soon be joined in the heavens by two more of the brighter planets - Saturn and Mars.
Saturn, the ringed planet, will also appear in the southwestern sky a little later in the evening, while Mars, the red planet, will rise about midnight and climb high in the southern sky by dawn.
The star chart shows the relative positions of the planets and prominent stars in the evening sky during the coming weeks. With Venus as the dominant object, the chart should be a useful guide for stargazers.

SAW SPUTNIK
WOMAN SAYS

Mrs. Helen Murphy of 113 
Hickory st. reported today 
that she saw what she thinks 
was Sputnik's rocket passing
over this area last night.
She said it was close to 10:00 
after and looked like a bright
star. "It moved faster than
a shooting star," she said.
"It was moving from north 
to south as it went. I saw it
and ran into the house to
get my husband. He came
out and we could see it in
the direction of the front
yard around to the back yard to 
watch some more. I guess we
could see it for a couple
minutes, something like that.
I looked just like the stars only
it was moving. I thought at
first it was a comet but it was
moving faster than it was.
"We saw nothing like it before
and he could have been wrong
in what I thought it was," she
said. 
H. L. Kissell, board president 
of the Morgantown chamber of
commerce, said his Morgantech team
would be looking againtonigit from
6:15 to 7:30 p.m.

The text in the document is as follows:

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
29 NOVEMBER 1957
SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL

STRANGE "UFO" CAPTURED BY BRAZILIAN AUTHORITIES: Well, what do you know? Someone is almost sure to say that another piece of material evidence has been captured to prove that they are solid. So far we only know about the strange item event from newspapers, but CDPV has already taken steps to have the items collected and turned over to the official scientific project. Do be sure to let us know what you discover regarding this item. It was not until a later date that we learned this event took place on November 29, 1957.

THE STRANGE OBJECT: 50 centimeters in diameter (one foot): fell from the sky on November 29 at 17:20 local time (20:20 GMT) on a farm near Leme. It is a dark round mass, like very fine ashes, extremely brittle, transparent as glass, and appeared to be "hot". One of the witnesses, Mr. Sebastiao Martins, said "My son yelled out to me, 'very high, coming down". It blackened about a foot or two where it struck the ground, apparently disintegrating on overhead. All of us (three people) watched eagerly as it struck the ground inside our location; ye could hardly see how or when it came down". After landing, the thing seemed to shrink a little bit.

A military air base at Araras reported sighting the same event a few minutes after it occurred. They stated that nobody was able to identify the strange thing; the best bet being that the object was the product of some material constructed and it was unnatural. In fact, proper tried to set it aside but the object only became red-hot and resisted. des-tinacao (Brazil's National Defense Secretary) has already taken steps to have the fallen material properly analyzed. So while some could be made an allegation that it was a meteorite, others suggested that it was a burnt coal fallen from the first Sputnik, still others suggested that perhaps the sounded mass is nothing else but... Mr. Martins Silvio: Resident of Leme, has a glass power plant examined the elements with a magnifying glass and concluded that the "wires" are attached to a central densing nucleus. Perhaps he detected what seemed to be a mind. Polícia, has already taken steps to have the fallen material property analyzed. CDPV is doing its best to get a sample, as well the results of the analysis, and if the thing proves to be of any value, a special air-delivered bulletin will be sent to all subordinates.

POST SCRIPT TO THE CAPTURED UFO REPORT.
Less finally, mentioned on page 5 is now being pointed out as more strange thing fallen from the sky in Los Barios, Brazil, reported on paper No.31 (headquarters file No. 9). A strange metal "some-thing" which appeared to be nearly coneless, of a peculiar design, struck the ground near Los Banos. It was pried up and secured by the local militarla forces. A closer examination is promised to determine, if possible, whether it does not represent a Geiger-Miller counter with some of the natural radioactivity, or might be a 'thing' of some other manufactured origin. Thus far the metallurgical and chemical analysis shows it to be a fragment of metal, but not of any regular manufacture. The details are yet to be studied.
U.S. CAPTURED UFO MATERIAL ANALYSIS.
The Institute in Sao Paulo has completed the analysis of the object captured in Lima, that is now known as the "shining things". 
1.) The analysis was made by the chemist Paul Philip, who wrote the following: 
"The sample presents a cluster of 'black' filaments. Submitted to calculation the analysis revealed 40% carbon and a mineral residue of the same sort, essentially constituted by 65% silicon - an amount much above the mineral found in the meteorites. The silicon was not destroyed. These analysis and some complementary others allow us to conclude that the filaments consist of some carbonic matter originated by incomplete combustion of an organic substance.
2.) It is therefore found that the 'filaments' that originate it (are submitted to in-complete combustion. Therefore nothing can be said about what was it"
In just this text we can see that there are no photographs or visual elements, only a detailed text analysis of some captured UFO material.

POST SCRIPTUM TO THE CAPTURED UFO ENTRY: The strange thing fallen from the sky in Lins, Brazil, mentioned on page 5, is now being examined by Instituto de Pesquisas da Marinha (Institute for Marine Research). The material retrieved seems to be made of a special alloy, according to the specialists. The counter instruments attached to the sample indicate that two types of radiation, one high and one low, were present, possibly because if it had, some of the natural radioactivity would be present in the rocks. Another explanation is that this could have been caused by any unusual or nuclear process, because it was found that the material collected has quite unusual properties.

UFO CAPTURED BY BRAZILIAN AUTHORITIES. RESULT OF ANALYSIS: The rapidity of the reactions to the loud sounds and the visual observation of the "Flying Saucer" No.9 (anglos 54-6). The analysis was made by the chemist Paul Philip, who wrote the following statement:

"The sample presents a cluster of black filaments. Submitted to calcination, the material decreases 50% in weight. The chemical analysis revealed that it contains essentially constituted by 95% silicon dioxide (This indicates that the carbonic matter was eliminated by calcination, and some complementary others allow us to conclude that the filaments are constituted by fiberglass coated by some carbonic matter originated by incomplete combustion of an organic substance. The results waiting can be said about the nature of the organic matter that was in?"

30 November 1957
London, England

Source: APRO Bulletin July 1963

Two men were observing the night sky when they sighted an object which appeared to be an aircraft. The object was described as round, emitting a reddish glow, and moving at a high rate of speed. It was estimated to be about two miles away and approximately 1,000 feet in altitude. The object changed direction abruptly and then disappeared from view within a few minutes, leaving no trace.
