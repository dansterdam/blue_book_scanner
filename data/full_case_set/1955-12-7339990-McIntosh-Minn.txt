This page does not contain any photographs. It appears to be handwritten text describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The text reads:

"(5) It was outside of safety, was away stars, from an angle of so degrees to 85 degrees perpendicular to the surface of the earth. It came up right on, it started down a type of reentry, that is the outside light had to use about 5 seconds to return to the ground. This was the wrong in one reason that I couldn't say to report this to the air force at that time, because in those days, people did not listen more than I did, they was just flat. That is a big they were for seeing that particular things."

"Within we got into San Jose I phoned the news paper office - San Jose mercury, to see if anyone else had reported it. When I left are if appeared some may near the McChord field he travel."

"I asked the newspaper office and they would phone them to see if they picked anything over, but they said they had destroyed the papers after a few minutes. I advised them that they would have to fill out the field reports, but they said they did not want to do anything with them. The newspaper office did not tell me that they had been getting a lot of calls lately of UFO sightings, but I'm sure this particular night, Mr. Gordon, I realize that without any scientific proof of the report, it really does not have much weight on the identity of the objects. I have never had any thing like this and I suppose that I would not realize that if it was only a member of the human race it reports as some one like you. One thing that really bothered me when I saw them before I, ..."

Dear Sirs,

I am forwarding a letter to you: office reports on the P.O. Sighting which I had sent to Dr. Edward U. Condon at the University of Colorado. They returned my letter with a note stating that the original office where this was closed out no further action was required, and felt the matter was satisfactorily covered in the information report on the incident.

I hope that you will excuse me for not returning this to you first, but I didn't know who to send it to, and it became a little embarrassing after reading the conclusion of Mr. Condon's report on this page.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

RECEIVED FEB 24 1969

Dear Mr. Comton:

I have read over again the report regarding the information I gained relative to the sighted UFOB. The conclusion of your report plus a few other factors have persuaded me to write this letter.

I would like to report that on being interviewed in 1955, the facts I gave part of there was apparently incorrect, and I now realize it was because of the significance of the sighting which led me to embellish my story is the thought that has dawned on me. This has caused me to feel that I would like the true significance of whether it was a significant sighting or not.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

At the time of the sighting I was
driving in San Jose Calif. with my
oldest brother. We were returning
to San Jose from a pleasant hunting
trip in Britty. We were on the
return trip and had traveled perhaps
and join me) it was approx. 11:17 A.M.
and the weather was as clear as a bell.
I was sitting on the passenger side,
looking out the window - when out of
the corner of my eye I saw a flash.
As I looked up I saw what appeared
to be a meteor-like object streaking over
the trees and falling downwards at a
tremendous speed. It disappeared behind
some trees and I could not see
where it landed, but I yelled out to
my brother that I spotted what 
I thought was a meteor. I don't know
my eye's off of it for a couple of seconds
that my brother had seen it. This
was not was not too mention.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. Based on the text in the image, this appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report.

Transcribed text:

"It looked like a large ball of white fire. At first it was coming to a stop at an altitude of approx 5500 ft and remained stationary for a time, then started off again to move horizontally. It was approx 50 ft to 75 ft in diameter. 

It seemed just like a large ball of white fire. At first it was kind of hazy, but then it became brighter and brighter until it began to glow. I was not able to see that it was newly round. 

There were several sets of lights that were maneuvering one... another that was near it and other distant lights that were also maneuvering.

The object stayed there hovering for about five minutes and then was no sound at all, and then I noticed that the object was beginning to change slightly from white to more of a yellowish, and then it was left in a terrific burst of speed."

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report. The text in the document is as follows:

"It was a reddish colored oblong or whatever you want to call it, that spent maybe four or five years out of at out of a possible eight or so. Their fastest move, but I had never seen anything move so fast as this thing. When it pulled out I little it arc but at the same elevation. As it got further away its color changed to a bright orange, but just before it went out of sight on the horizon there was a flame that shot out again and a little larger. The flame was coming back to where we were, and then it went off some, but it kept receding toward the coast and went out of sight. The sort of thought that this is written in ration has caused it to get brighter again. When it first came into the field of spect it certainly was within less than ten miles per hour."
