This page does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text only.

Here is the text from the document:

People seemed to exist in a state of excitement and hopelessness upon the occasion, they were either terrified or very curious and anxious to obtain information. It was difficult to get any of them to give any reasonably clear account of what they saw. Many of them had been drinking and their descriptions were confused and contradictory.

The object was seen by a large number of people, some of whom were more or less sober, and their descriptions, while not entirely consistent, do indicate that there was a definite physical object in the sky which was seen by a great many people. The object appeared to be hovering or maneuvering rather than in rapid flight although it did move away rather rapidly at the end. It was described as being about the size of a car, round or elliptical in shape, and emitting a bright glow or light. It seemed to be about 1000-2000 feet in altitude and was visible for about 10-15 minutes.
