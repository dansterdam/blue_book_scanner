11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS  
Observer reported to Duty Officer that he saw a saucer-shaped object on 12 December 1960. The craft was about 15 feet in diameter and was seen for 5 seconds. In the direction he observed, the object changed direction several times, traveling at much 2.2 and was seen for 4 to 5 minutes.

The image contains two drawings. The larger drawing is a compass rose with directional labels. The smaller drawings show two different perspectives of what appears to be a person observing a phenomenon in the sky.

AFR 80-17(C1)
6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE - AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. PLACE A "Z" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN.
7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "Y" WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE MOVEMENT
OR DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON. DRAW ADDITIONAL SKETCHES IF NECESSARY TO ILLUSTRATE TACTUALLY AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE
THE LARGER SKETCH.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, specifically the "Sighting of Unidentified Phenomena Questionnaire" form.
