1. The following information is in confirmation of information furnished orally to your command on 17 June 1954, to capitalize on experience compiled on 27 June 1954.

2. On 18 June 1954, at approximately 1930 hours, this office was requested by the Senior Controller, Air Force Missile Test Center Interceptor Officer, regarding the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

3. On 18 June 1954, Major K. C. SMALLEY, Intelligence Branch, AFOATS, advised this office that he had received a report that at 2130 hours, 18 June 1954, civilian employees at a Patrick Air Force Base radar site near Indialantic, Florida, had observed an unidentified object or objects, which was described as circular, about 1/4 the size of the full moon, and was accompanied by a string of smaller lights. The weather was overcast, with intermittent showers. The object was observed to be approximately 100 yards offshore. The light flashes lasted for approximately four (4) seconds and recurred at approximately ten (10) minute intervals; the light began to cycle again for approximately ten (10) seconds, then went out. After the object had disappeared, the lights were observed on the water for several minutes. There was no sound associated with the sighting, and nothing could be seen. The lights did not re-appear after the sighting, and there were no other indications of anything further observed.

4. On 18 June 1954, this office was requested to determine circumstances surrounding the sighting of an unidentified aerial object on 18 June 1954. Concerning the thinking of an unidentified aerial object, it is believed that the likelihood of this being a meteor, natural phenomenon, or the like is quite remote.

SUBJECT: (Unclassified) UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
13 June 1954, under air police desk Sergeant's log, reflected that a 1/JD lawn R. MANLEY, AF-1447944O, a USAF air police squadron, sighted an unidentified flying object. The object appeared to be followed by two fighter aircraft. The control tower was notified. MANLEY was interviewed on 15 June 1954. He noticed a glowing light in the sky, northwest of Post 326, at approximately 9:00 o'clock. The object appeared nearly round in shape and remained in an aircraft's landing light. The object remained motionless for approximately 1 minute and then descended vertically at an extremely fast rate. It remained in the same position, and in color, changing to bright white, and disappeared abruptly. The entire sighting was approximately 4 to 5 minutes. MANLEY stated that he saw a circular white light, about the size of a quarter held at arm's length, and that it moved in a normal airline course. It was not sighted again. 
On 14 June 1954, 3/SGT M. J. BENEDICT, AF-1331748, Weather Observer, reported the following information:

BENEDICT, previously referred to, rather restrained his observation and amplified the following information in the weather observer's report for 15 June 1954:
At 2115 hours, EDT 15 June 1954, this object was observed:
Altitude - 1,000 ft.
Diameter of object - 25-30 ft.
Position - stationary
Duration - 4.5 minutes
Maneuvering - none
Weather - scattered clouds at 4,000 feet
Visibility - 12,000 feet
Reliability - is 4.6
Wind - 210/6 at 3 miles per hour
Altimeter - 29.920 inches 
Remarks - color-white. Appeared to hover at 1,000 ft. altitude for 4.5 minutes.
On 17 June 1954, this office was advised by Major RUSSEL F. HOSELEY, 002900A, Eglin AFB, Florida. that at 2230 hours, 17 June 1954, a jet pilot of the 10th Fighter Bomber Squadron, JINGOLSKI, altitude 32,000 feet, observed a bright unidentified object over the same area, Indialantic, Florida. HOSELEY called to inform him from Base Operations to witness the object. These two (2) sightings were, in the opinion of HOSELEY, positively the same object. JINGOISKJ was scrambled, but the object had disappeared. JINGOISKI was the pilot and DONALD S. DUNCAN, Asst. 19808th Air Base Group, Patrick AFB, Florida, was the observer. 
The object was described as bright and shiny reflecting the sun. It appeared to be circular in shape, with a definite outline and no apparent aerodynamic features. No exhaust or trail was observed. The object was first sighted at an altitude of 35,000 to 40,000 feet and descended rapidly to an altitude of 32,000 feet during the course of its movement and appeared to veer right and left as it moved. The color of the object was blue, fluorescent in nature, changing intermittently to white. No discernible features were observed and the object was completely silent in operation. The shape remained constant throughout the observation.
The elapsed time of the observation was approximately 30 seconds. The object disappeared from view to the northwest direction after the jet pilot broke off directly west of Patrick AFB. The object was observed by ground coverage to ants for 3613 hours, EST, 17 June 1954. The object appeared to be several times larger than the jet aircraft and was visible in the sky also. Occasionally, when the light blinked and became brighter, it appeared that the object might be rotating or changing its aspect on the sun. 
Observation made at 2320 hours, EST, 15 June 1954
Surface temperature - 79 degrees Fahrenheit
Wind - 23, variable to 45 knots per hour
Clouds - 3/10 cumulus at 1,700 feet.
