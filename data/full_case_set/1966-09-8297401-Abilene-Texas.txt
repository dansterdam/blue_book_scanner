There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

4,000 FEET ABOVE GROUND STATION RADAR - NONE 
KNOWN 4-PIECE AIRCRAFT WORKING IN THE AREA. WEATHER, LOCAL FAA, AND CLINE RADIO WERE CONTACTED. 
THEIR WEATHER STATION HAD NO INFORMATION ABOUT AIRCRAFT WORKING IN THE AREA. ONE WEATHER BALLOON WAS RELEASED BY THE CIVILIAN STATION AT 22:22Z. DYFESS TOWER WAS CONTACTED AND THEY SAW NOTHING UNUSUAL. INVESTIGATOR HAS NO WAY TO FURTHER EVALUATE SIGHTINGS AS THE INDIVIDUALS CONTACTED WERE ONLY THE ONES REPORTING UFO.
