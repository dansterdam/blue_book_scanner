Statement

From religious information: Major Rowe
AO3 Report 5-01
Hutchinson Kansas

I have recently received a report concerning the observation of a UFO of small size and unusual characteristics.  According to the information received, the sighting occurred around 11:30PM on 8 July 1962 by Mr. [redacted], a mature and reliable witness residing at [redacted] Hutchinson, Kansas.  Mr. [redacted] observed the object from his backyard as it hovered some 200-300 feet above the ground for a period of approximately 3-5 minutes before moving rapidly away.  The object was described as round, glowing orange in color, and approximately 10-12 feet in diameter.  No sound was reported.  While hovering, the object appeared to be rotating slowly.  During its departure, the object accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds.

This incident was reported to the United States Air Force on 9 July 1962.  The reporting officer is of the opinion that this sighting represents a legitimate observation of an unidentified flying object.  This report is submitted for your review and appropriate action.
