SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

DATE: 20 March 1950

SUBJECT: Observance of Unidentified Objects in Sky, Vicinity of Nashville, Tennessee

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:
Unidentified objects were reported to have been observed in the sky at Marrowbone Lake near Nashville, Tennessee. 

On 19 Mar 1950, two Nashville Real Estate Salesmen, were fishing on the lake (location not specified, Tenn.) when the following incident occurred: Between six and twelve o'clock, the objects were seen hovering above the lake. They were black in color, round in shape, about the size of a 300 lb. bomb, and made a noise like wind blowing through trees. No motors were visible. They were fairly close together, and remained together, revolving at least 500 miles per hour. The witnesses (attached clipping) relates that a spokesman at Stewart Air Force Base, Smyrna, Tenn., indicated that the objects could not have been mistaken for military aircraft because of the descriptions given. The witnesses were contacted at 1200 hrs, 20 Mar 1950 and they had accomplished nothing regarding investigation of the incident.
