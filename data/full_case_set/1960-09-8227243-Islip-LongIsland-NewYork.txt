PAGE THREE RZJZR 29
WAS CALLED IN TO THE OFFICER OF THE DAY AT SUFFOLK COUNTY AFB, NEW YORK WHO NOTIFIED THE SENIOR DIRECTOR AT THE NY AIR DEFENSE SECTOR. AT THE SAME TIME, THE OFFICER NOTIFIED THIS SECTOR EXPERIENCING SOME JAMMING AT VARIOUS OF OUR RADAR SITES. SCRAMBLE ORDERS WERE GIVEN AND TWO F-101A AIRCRAFT WERE SENT TO THE AREA OF THE REPORTED SIGHTINGS. THEY COULD NOT LOCATE ANY TARGET NIT DESCRIBED
BEING "VERY PRETTY AURORA BOREALIS." ADDITIONALLY, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A WEATHER BALLOON WAS LAUNCHED FROM IDLEWILD AIRPORT AT 23332.
THE INTERCEPTOR SECTION ADVISED THAT A WEATHER BALLOON OVER THE ISLIP AREA ABOUT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. HOWEVER, THE INTERCEPTOR CREWS DID NOT SEE ANY BALLOON. IT IS FELT THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE REPORT WAS THAT THE OBSERVED AURORA BOREALIS WAS MISTAKEN BY THE OBSERVERS AS A MANMADE WEATHER BALLOON WHICH DRIFTED AWAY BEFORE THE INTERCEPTORS COULD
REACH THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING. THE COMBINATION OF THE INITIAL SIGHTINGS AND THIS SECTOR EXPERIENCING JAMMING AT RADAR SITES ALL AT THE SAME TIME LEADS THIS OFFICER TO BELIEVE THAT THE AURORA BOREALIS WAS THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT.
