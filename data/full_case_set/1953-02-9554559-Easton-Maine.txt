STATEMENT:

Between 2030 hours and 2130 hours, either 23 February 1953, or 24 February 1953, as I was about to retire for the evening, I did see something unusual in the sky. The object first appeared to me as a starlike object which seemed to be moving in an arc. After observing it for a few moments, I noticed that the object was much larger and brighter than a star. The light was first observed as I was about to close the venetian blind to the window in the rear of my home. These are the facts:

The light was first observed as a starlike object, but as I watched it further, I noticed that it was circular in shape and was much larger and brighter than a star. It had a rather steady bright glow and did not appear to be twinkling as stars do. The light appeared to be somewhat higher than the tree tops and just above the horizon. I watched the light for approximately 10 to 15 minutes and during this time it appeared to be traveling in a slight arc towards the south. The light did not appear to vary in intensity during the time I observed it. I do not know the direction of the wind at the time nor the weather conditions, but the sky was clear and the stars were very bright. 

As I watched the light, I called my daughter to observe it also. She confirmed what I was seeing. She stated that the light appeared to be circular in shape and larger than a star. She also noticed that it had a steady glow and was not twinkling. At one point during the observation, the light appeared to make a slight change in direction, but this change was very slight. I definitely do not believe that this light was a star.

I would like to state that I have lived in this area for over twenty (20) years and am familiar with the various aircraft and other lights that are frequently seen in the sky. This light did not resemble any of the other lights as I have previously observed them. I discussed the appearance of this light with my daughter, who works in the local AF office with my daughter-in-law. They were unable to offer any explanation as to what the object might have been, but they stated that the light was similar to other objects that have been observed in the vicinity on previous occasions. However, as no time have I discussed the subject with others.

I dismissed the importance of this light from my mind and will not return here the only pressure that the following year and month convinced me to report this incident.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document regarding "Cruising Altitudes" and "Visual Flight Plan" for aircraft operations. 

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

CRUISING ALTITUDES WITHIN CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES - During VFR conditions, aircraft at altitudes of 3000 feet or more above the surface of the earth shall conform to airways, including controlled airways, and must be flown at odd altitudes. Where a VOR or non-directional radio range is established, aircraft shall use the appropriate altitudes indicated on the appropriate sectional chart. Eastbound flights - Aircraft shall fly on even thousand-foot altitudes, such as 4000, 6000, or 8000 feet. Westbound flights - Aircraft shall fly at odd thousand-foot altitudes, such as 5000, 7000, or 9000 feet. Northbound flights - Aircraft shall fly at odd thousand-foot altitudes, such as 5000, 7000, or 9000 feet. Southbound flights - Aircraft shall fly at even thousand-foot altitudes, such as 4000, 6000, or 8000 feet. Where a color airway coincides with a VFR airway, the GCA orEVEN rule for the appropriate color airway will apply. Where no color airway is involved and an Even-numbered VOR airway coincides, the EVEN rule or EVEN-numbered VOR airway will apply. 

CRUISING ALTITUDES OUTSIDE CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES - When the flight visibility is less than 3 miles, aircraft must fly at altitudes appropriate to the magnetic course, as illustrated below.

VISUAL FLIGHT PLAN - The Civil Air Regulations do not require that a visual flight plan be filed except for certain flights. However, the filing of such a flight plan is sometimes advisable in search and rescue operations if such action becomes necessary. A flight plan may be submitted to the nearest CAA communications station and, if filed, should be activated upon departure and closed upon arrival. If filing the flight plan, the pilot should state the name of the CAA communications station with which he will file the flight arrival report. This must be clearly understood by all concerned. VFR flights plans are transmitted to the CAA communications system only if filed by the pilot. If information concerning a flight is desired, the nearest CAA communications station should be consulted.

Pilots desiring to make flight operations reports, should include in the report the following: "The flight plan shall contain the phrase INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES - except when a cruising altitude is provided, the term in lieu of an actual altitude indicates that the pilot intends to fly in accordance with Visual Flight Rules. Aircraft may climb or descend to and maintain the cruising altitude provided, unless a defined cloud or other formation prohibit."

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather two drawings or diagrams. The first diagram shows the "SEA LEVEL" with a scale from 500 feet to 2500 feet. The second diagram shows a "5000 FOOT ELEVATION" landscape.

LOSS OF AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE DURING HOT WEATHER
Do you realize that Kansas City Airport with an elevation of 744 feet above sea level can have an effective elevation of 5,500 feet under certain conditions?
Do you realize that Adams Airport at 3,575 feet above sea level, can be above the normal operating altitude of your aircraft during hot, hazy, and humid weather?
The rarified air at high altitude results in a reduction of engine power, and becomes a factor, not only in performance, but in the safety of your flights. A typical light plane that will cruise at 130 mph at sea level may only be able to make 90 mph at 10,000 feet. This plane might be able to clear a 2,000 foot obstacle at sea level, but it certainly will not clear a 4,000 foot obstacle at 10,000 feet. Remember: Any decrease in engine performance (due to high temperature) greatly increases the takeoff and landing distance required.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

CRUISING ALTITUDES
CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES - During VFR conditions aircraft at altitudes of
7,000 to 17,000 feet moy climb, descend, or crosa through control zones and areas 
as specified in the "Aeronautical Information Manual" and "ATC
instructions." Below 7,000 feet, aircraft shall remain outside of control zones and
areas, except as permitted by the control tower or control center. When a color airway 
coincides with a VFR airway, the GCA or EVEN VFR rule for the appropriate color airway will apply. Where no color airway is involved and an EVEN-numbered VFR airway is concerned, the ODD VFR altitude rule will apply.

CRUISING ALTITUDES OUTSIDE CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES - When the flight visibility is less than 3 miles, aircraft must be flown at an altitude appropriate to the magnetic course as follows:

VISUAL FLIGHT PLAN
The Civil Air Regulation do not require that a visual flight plan, or flight plan, be filed for flights under VFR to which the filing of a flight plan is not mandatory. However, the filing of such a flight plan is considered desirable in many operations and in certain circumstances may be required, as in certain control zones or by certain air carrier operating rules. A flight plan may be submitted to the nearest FAA communications facility by telephone, radio, or in person.

If filing the flight plan, the pilot should state the nature of the CAA communication station with which he will communicate, the arrival report procedures, and the method by which the arrival report will be filed. A VFR night flight plan are transmitted by CAA communications stations to other CAA communications stations to determine the location of the aircraft. If no information concerning the aircraft is received by the CAA station at the estimated time of arrival, an alert will be immediately initiated.

It is important that all pilots make certain that notice of arrival of their aircraft has been filed, as failure to do so may result in the initiation of unnecessary search and rescue operations. If a flight is terminated prior to reaching the destination, the pilot should inform the nearest CAA communications station so that the flight plan report would be canceled.

VISUAL FLIGHT PLANS FROM WHICH TO MAKE FLIGHT - Flight Plan, except "Alternate
* VFR" which provides for operating when weather conditions permit visual flight operations but are not adequate for filing an IFR flight plan, in lieu of an actual attitude indicator, that the pilot intends to fly in accordance with Visual Flight Rules. Air carrier aircraft may be required to file a flight plan in accordance with company procedures, even though not required by regulation.

The image appears to contain a chart titled "THE KOCH CHART FOR ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS" that provides information on the effects of altitude and temperature on aircraft flight. The chart includes a graph with various altitude and temperature readings, as well as explanatory text about how to interpret the chart.

THE KOCH CHART FOR
ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS

TO FIND THE EFFECT OF ALTITUDE AND TEMPERATURE ON YOUR AIRPLANE'S FLIGHT PERFORMANCE:

READ THE INCREASE IN TAKE-OFF DISTANCE AND THE DECREASE IN RATE OF CLIMB FROM STANDARD SEA LEVEL VALUES HERE 

EXAMPLE: The diagonal line shows that at 40% increase in temperature (e.g. from 59°F to 83°F) and an altitude of 10,000 feet, the take-off distance increases by 30% and the rate of climb decreases by 40%.

This chart indicates typical representative values for "personal" airplanes.
For exact values consult your airplane flight manual.
The chart may be conservative for airplanes with supercharged engines.
Also remember that long grass, sand, mud or deep snow can greatly reduce your take-off distance.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED LIGHT

I. DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT:
The object was described as a single white light, not bright but dull in color. It appeared to be spherical in shape with a diameter estimated as being larger than two (2) to three (3) times larger than a star. The light did not appear to be pulsating or flashing. It maintained a steady, constant intensity during the entire period of observation.

II. TIME OF SIGHTING:
The object was first observed at approximately 1930 hrs EST. It was observed continuously for a period of thirty-five (35) minutes, disappearing from sight at 2005 hrs EST.

III. MANNER OF OBSERVATION:
The observation was conducted by two (2) observers with the naked eye. No optical or electronic equipment was used. Motions of the light were established by the observers with the help of reference objects (telephone poles, etc.).

IV. LOCATION OF OBSERVERS:
Observers were stationed at two (2) different locations, approximately two (2) miles west of GARFIELD CORNERS, (Near a farmhouse located on the main highway about 2-1/2 miles south of Aroostook UNIONGRANDE Hall (N46°25' W67°59')) approximately two (2) miles west of MAYSVILLE CORNERS (N46°27' W68°01'), They were approximately 3-3/4 miles apart and both observed the light in the vicinity of AROOSTOOK UNIONGRANDE HALL (N46°25' W67°59') approximately 2-1/4 miles north-northeast. Direction of the light during observation was from North to North-west was observed. No estimate of distance from the observers was obtained.

V. IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OF OBSERVERS:
The two observers were identified as Mr. and Mrs. J. D. YOUNG of 5 EASTEX STREET, PRESQUE ISLE, MAINE. They have had no previous experience or training in aerial observation and identification as well as very good knowledge of the area under observation. They appear to be very reliable.

AF FORM 112—PART II 
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: AATS 30073 AlAS, IIAAP3 
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
REFERENCE NO. 29-R-4a
We reached a point on the highway near the Aroostook Union Grange Hall where we observed a strange object for approximately 1 minute. At this time the object appeared to be moving away, considering the fact that it seemed to be farther away. The light seemed to be about the size of the North Star, smaller than a 1-inch ball. It emitted a steady light with no variation in intensity. It was moving in a Northerly direction.
We continued our journey toward Presque Isle, still observing the light through the windshield. The light seemed to disappear at a point near Presque Isle, having maintained a steady course the entire time. it turned sharply toward the east, then as it faded gradually away.
We are very familiar with the area described above and the location of Presque Isle. The weather conditions were very good during the entire observation with the brightness of the star in the west being the only object of comparison. The light was much brighter than the brightest star in the west and found it to be two (2) to three (3) times the size. The above described actions during the entire sighting (15) minutes at various speeds and altitudes with excellent visibility, clear sky, no wind, moon out and all stars clearly distinguished.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this document. I will now proceed to produce the text content from the document:

The 23 February 1953, at approximately 5:20 p.m., EST, 7 unidentified lights were sighted by five civilians, including a 13-year-old girl. The lights were maneuvering in the air over Easton, Maine. The lights were observed for approximately 3 minutes and 30 seconds. 

The lights appeared to be located in the approximate treetop level. The lights were described as reddish-orange in color and were observed to make slight maneuvers in the air, hovering and darting back and forth in an apparently controlled manner. The lights seemed to flicker or pulsate at times. The lights appeared to be flying in loose formation, with the individual lights widely separated from one another.

Upon reaching the above-quoted timestamp, we noticed that the movement of the lights became more rapid. The lights were then observed to accelerate rapidly and disappear from sight, apparently traveling at a very high rate of speed. The duration of the whole sighting was approximately 3 minutes and 30 seconds.

I would like to add that I am a former T/S with 2175 hours and I am familiar with aircraft performance. I have substantial relevant experience in STO during WWII, with the above-named aircraft performance.
