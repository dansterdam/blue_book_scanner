DOD DIR 5200.10

19 June 1954

Subject: Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object over Coachella, California; Special Inquiry, INS 24-332

TO: Director of Special Investigations 
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

1. REFERENCE: On 27 May 1954, a letter was received by letter from the DISTRICT INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 20TH AIR DIVISION, HAMILTON AFB, CALIFORNIA, that on 15 May 1954, a resident of Coachella, California, had reported a sighting of an unidentified aerial object to the local Sheriff's office. The letter stated that the subject reported sighting an object and requested an evaluation.

2. DETAILS: Squadron Leader HOGAN, in a signed statement, advised that he was on exercise on 15 May 1954. He was on an Air Force exercise in the vicinity of Coachella, California, and was not aware of the incident.

At approximately 1330 hours, HOGAN spotted up the risk with positive intention on W/19 and a descend was commenced on a heading of 240 degrees. HOGAN descended to approximately 3500 feet and observed what appeared to be an aircraft in the eleven o'clock position. HOGAN continued his descent, keeping the object under observation. When he was at approximately 2000 feet, the object and he were at approximately the same altitude. HOGAN attempted to close to within visual range of the object and the W/19 appeared to react as though it were under control and was accelerating. HOGAN was unable to close in on the object and the W/19 and his air-speed were exceeded.

HOGAN stated that he considered the object to be an aircraft, but could not identify it specifically. He submitted this report through channels for what it was worth.

DIF OCT, Subj: Sighting of Unidentified Arial Object on 15 May 1954
OVER GERNADA, California, sightings from Elsinore, California.

This report states that the aerial object was descending at an angle of about 24 to 30 degrees, and was observed for several minutes. The object appeared to be "very high," as least the 25,000 foot level.

The report indicates that this series of events took place with great rapidity, and the object had vanished to his view.

The observer concludes that this had been struck, and immediately virtually checked and concluded that it appeared to be a "very high" altitude "jet" fighter, as the object had vanished to his view.

Neither major observing radar, nor Weather Observer, nor Squadron Leader identified the object. Squadron Leader HECTOR concluded that the altitude of all three aircraft at the time of this incident was approximately 5,000 to 10,000 feet, and the people did not see this object.

In a signed statement, Ronald W. PATTEN, Flight Lieutenant, Royal Air Force, flying as Under Observer for "Squadron Leader HECTOR" at the time, corroborated the circumstances of the incident, and stated that it appeared to him that the object observed did not conform to any known type of aircraft.

The statement is co-executed by HECTOR and PATTEN, along with a sketch of the object as it appeared to them.

SIGHTING REPORT--UNUSUAL OBJECT

13 MAY 1954

STATION: ELSINORE, CA, Donald R. Squiller, RAF

SIGHTING REPORT---UNUSUAL OBJECT

At approximately 2235 I was alerted by one of the USAF pilots under my command of a UFO. The object was first sighted in the southeast and was observed for approximately 30 minutes. It appeared to be metallic in nature, oval in shape, and had a red light at the top and a white light at the bottom. The object seemed to be oscillating and changing colors from red to white to blue-green. Its speed was approximately 500 knots and the altitude was estimated at 30,000 feet. As it passed overhead, the object stopped its oscillating motion and appeared to be a single steady, bright white light. After passing overhead, the object then accelerated to an estimated speed of 1,000 knots and disappeared from sight in a northerly direction. The total duration of the sighting was approximately 30 minutes. The attitude of all three aircraft was approximately 13,000 feet and the position was fixed as Elsinore, California.
