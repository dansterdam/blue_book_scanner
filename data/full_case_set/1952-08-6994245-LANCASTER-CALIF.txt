Re. 11:18PM Obs.
While on patrol at location, two bright objects were observed in the southern skies, at the same altitude. The objects appeared to be stationary and then suddenly they appeared to descend toward the western horizon, for approximately five seconds, then stop and appeared to remain in that position for a few seconds. At this time one of the objects appeared to move in an easterly direction and traveled at a moderate rate of speed and parallel to the horizon, for approximately 10 seconds. At this time it appeared to turn in a southerly p__lyotion and disappeared from view.

The other object remained stationary for approximately 10 minutes and started to descend toward the horizon in downward pendulum like motion and disappeared from view.
  
The above object was witnessed by Mr. & Mrs. ____________, at location of Undersigned.
          
At 11:40PM, date ___________, State Fish & Game Warden, called desk and reported seeing the above objects from his home. His description of objects and their motions coincides with above statements of Undersigned.
           
At approximately 11:45PM, date ___________, called station and reported seeing a strange object in the sky over the Lake Hughes Area.
Calls: Patlimo, ___________Air Base of the above and they in turn notified the U.S.A.F. George Air Base.

TITLE:	 USBI: Rumors of Flying Saucers

It is reported from Bonn that a German expert, a writer, will give
information in the next issue of Der Flieger about a flying saucer
which is stated to have landed in Spitsbergen and been examined by a
Norwegian rocket-weapon expert.

A few hours after the landing experts arrived and were certain it
was not manned and consisted, in the main, of a disc of steel of un-
known (alloy) composition. The diameter was 48,4m. An outer ring
was fitted with 46 jet motors which cause the disc to rotate round
and sphere in the center of which there are instruments for measuring
and remote control steering. There are stated to have Russian mark-
ings. The expert found an unamaged observer and sender instrument
with a plutonium core in the wreck which on all wave-lengths sent out
on a frequency of 934 hertz, unknown in any country.

The announcement has caused a great sensation in professional circles
in West Germany. No confirmation has been obtainable, but it is rumored that
the witness is well informed since German experts, have also been
consulted.

The chief of the Norwegian Defense Staff and Swedish experts have no
knowledge of and are skeptical about the information.

A telegram stated that an aircraft flew over a North Norwegian
district on 6 Aug 52 and release 4, apparently round, objects which
continued on a northerly course at about 5,000 m. height. No Nor-
wegian aircraft were up at the time.

(b) Witness stated that his information is based on authentic data,
states that at 4 a.m. on 1 Aug 52 a flying object was observed over
the southern Black Forest, at Herrenalb, in clear weather. It app-
eared as a shining body of light travelling from East to West at high
speed. The noise it made was like that of a turbine: it left a
trail of light.

Witness is convinced that the apparatus is of German origin and has
been appropriated by the Russians.

(c) A flying object, round like a ball at the forward edge, was
seen at Rovaniemi, in Finland, on the evening of 10 Aug 52. Its
color was a clear green and it left behind a red glow which soon dis-
appeared.

- 2 -

1. The flight object of 28.88 meters diameter, conical to the
outside, was unpiloted.

2. The silvery disc of circular shape, built from a metal of
not yet known composition, carries "46 equally spaced
automatic circular nozzles at the periphery, which turn
the disc, when in operation, with reference to the central
plexed glass sphere, which houses instrumentation for
measurement and remote control.

3. The dials and instruments have Russian figures and symbols.

4. The range of the disc seems to be better than 30,000
kilometers, the flight altitude 160 kilometers.

5. The aircraft, resembling the telltale flying saucer,
possesses enough space for a warhead with high explosive,
eventually for an A-Bomb.

The Norwegian specialists believe that the disc was launched
in U.S.S.R. By a transmitter or perhaps receiver breakdown it
impacted on Spitsbergen and destroyed itself partly by the
crash landing. The strange remotely controlled, unpiloted jet
aircraft will be transported via ship to Narvik for further
investigation.

The German weapon designer, Riedel, explained when receiving a
description of the disc: "That is a typical V7, on the mass
production of which I have worked myself."

(END OF TRANSLATION)

REMARKS BY RIEDEL

As usual, this report contains a nice collection of nonsense.
I have, nevertheless, translated as verbally as possible. The
"unknown" 934 Hertz, the statement about range and ceiling
altitude, etc., have to be consumed with a pound of salt. The
last paragraph quoting my name and the V7 is pure invention or
a direct misrepresentation of the "famous" scientist from Tel Aviv,
Dr. Miethe. He has stated in German papers that Germany,
specifically Peenemünde, was developing a V7, which resembled
the flying saucer of today.

Unidentified Flying Objects described in reference; one remaining stationary
over Lancaster, California, and one over Leona, California, approximately 8 miles then
moving slowly along the horizon and disappearing out of sight to the South, were
observed at 2235/PST 1 August 1952. This sighting was accompanied by a report from
other station personnel in Palmdale, California, who observed a brilliant red light
15 miles south of Lancaster during the period 2200/PST and 2201/PST.

2. A sheriff's patrol at 2237PST on 1 August 1952 observed two flying saucers, one remaining stationary over Lancaster, California and one over Leona Valley, California, hovering, stationary, at times, and moving slowly along the horizon, then accelerating out of sight to the south. This Leona Valley object appeared to be about the same luminous degree and the same dimension and visibility below the horizon. Sheriffs of both places compared notes. Records revealed by the two officers red light 25 mils north of Lancaster between 2206PST and 2207PST. One of the witnesses in the Palmdale sighting spent six years in the Navy as a pilot and stated that the sighting could have been a jet plane; however, he could see no normal identification lights.

Weather in the area at the time of sighting was clear. Visibility 15 miles, winds aloft 10,300 feet from 130° at 13 knots, 20,000 feet from 200° at 17 knots, 30,000 feet from 250° at 18 knots.

3. Witnesses: Mr. William D. Mellotte, Sheriff's office, Palmdale, California
                    Mr. H. D. Martinetti, Sheriff's office, Palmdale, California

Flight Air traffic in the area at the time of sighting was one KevIon westbound over Palmdale at 2315PST and one C-46 eastbound over Palmdale at 2236PST.

Comments of Reporting Officers

5. Sheriff Mellotte's six years experience as a Navy pilot should adequately quality him for making accurate aerial observations. Witnesses were not interrogated as interseption action was taken by the 27th Air Defense Command Division and no object sightings were reported from radar sites.

FTD-5        -8-M. . . . . . In compliance with the request of Major Herman on 2 August 1952, 
the Los Angeles Country Sheriff's Sub-station was contacted on that date and the two (2)
sheriff's deputies who reported sighting the "flying saucers" on 1 August 1952 were 
interviewed. The interviewing officer was Captain Paul E. Shoemacher of the Air Force
Flight Test Center. The written report made by the two (2) deputies is inclosed with
this message as well as the report of the interviewing officer. It has not been 
possible to correlate this report with any operation from Edwards Air Force Base. The
only operation of the Air Force Flight Test Center during the approximate time period
was a flight of one (1) F-94C in the general area of the sighting. However, this
aircraft landed at Edwards Air Force Base at 1115 Pacific Daylight Saving Time whereas
the initial sighting was reported at 1118 Pacific Daylight Saving Time. It is believed
that the enclosed reports are self explanatory.

Subject: Report of interview with observersof strange flying objects,
"Flying Saucers", in Lancaster, Calif. area.

Interviewer: Capt. Paul E. Shoemaker, AAFB

Date, 2 Aug 52

Verbal questioning substantiatated the details set forth in the
attached Sheriff's Office report prepared by deputy W.D. Mallette and
T.M. Morrissw.

The following additional facts were obtained:

The sky was very clear; no clouds were visible in any direction
and the moonlight was very bright.

The objects appeared to be white- yellow lights, elliptical in
shape with hazy outlines.

Size of the objects was about that of a B/####/# baseball.

No noise from the objects was discernable.

The objects appeared side by side about 20 degrees above the
mountain horizon in the south. They then moved west in fomation
at the same time descending to about five degrees above the
horizon. One of the objects removed in this motion while
the other returned at the same elevation to the original position
and then became dimmer and dissappeared from view. The one remaining
in the west descended slowly with a pendulous motion for about
14 minutes until it disappeared below the horizon.

The horisontal movement of the objects was described as, "drifting."
