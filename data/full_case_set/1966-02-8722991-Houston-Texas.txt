34. Date you completed this questionnaire:	26 Feb. 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific point questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Friday, Feb. 4, 1966, 5:30 A.M. Mr. and I were in the kitchen when we heard a strange noise coming from outside. We ran outside and saw a very strange looking object hovering over the trees. I cannot correctly be explained. I have never seen anything like this before. The object became brighter and dimmer. When I first saw it I thought a plane was just above the tree line. It was 40-50 feet across and looked like a big airplane with no wings. It made a complete circle and came back to the same spot. At a tremendous speed it took off straight up and the sky cleared. After it was gone we did not hear any sound of an airplane. We felt no warmth and the object was about 20-30 feet above the ground. The object appeared a copper color and more like a well-polished mirror. We felt no heat even when the object was very bright.

On one side of the object there appeared to be a portholes with a blinking light on the other side. I couldn't understand the action. It was very fast and the object simply disappeared in the sky. I didn't notice any landing or takeoff, it was just there one minute and gone the next. There was no smoke and no noise made by the object during the entire observation. We watched it for about 5-10 minutes. It's very hard to explain.

INTER HECKEL QUINTERNILLA. CR. 
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AF8, OHIO 

Dear Sir:

This is in reference to your personal note concerning several reports
of unusual aerial objects observed in relation to recent flight incidents.

Since I have been asked on the report sheet and advice to send
a copy of this letter to your office, if a reported incident
should come to my attention. I have with me several reports 
which I feel I should bring to your attention.

Our son, Capt. ________ _____, is in the ___ ___ in ____ ____. He 
has given us the account of his experience which is in full agreement with
what you have told us not to do, i.e., not to make any publicity concerning 
experiences with unusual aerial sightings. We still are very interested in
this matter ourselves, but will not do this unless I am told otherwise.

Similar incidents are occurring to neighbors concerning what they believe
to be unidentified flying objects. There are persuasive reports of others in 
this area reporting the same. The latest was yesterday. There are no reports
of the sane of the story being connected with the Russian action. Therefore,
it does not seem to be connected to the display on the war. I realise the
makers of the story may not be persons responsible for the making. However,
for your own information, you might want to give this some thought.

Sincerely,

P.S. I am a teacher at Denham Junior High School.

I am the object of the report to you. It looked to me to be as large as my house, with a movement in every direction. It seems to be moving up and down and vibrating as a glowing bright object a big light like shape. It will definitely be a sighting to me and my husband and son also the scene. 25 husband said son "let's go home".
