Dear Sir:
It will probably not come as much of a surprise to you -- it certainly didn't to me -- that at 6:05 pm Friday, Sept. 13, 1968, I saw and was astonished by a UFO. I came into contact with it at a good altitude. It was going extremely fast, much faster than any jet I have ever seen. As it circled, it was swaying as if it had no controls. It disappeared behind the trees and I could see no evidence of any engine or propellant. I am age twelve. My address is Huntington, L.I., N.Y. 11743.
Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
P.S. My father, [Redacted], is a pilot, retired weather C.A.V.U.

The image appears to be a scan of a page from a Project Blue Book report. It contains a sketch or drawing of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified aerial object. The text below the image states "SHOW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENA. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROJECTIONS, AND INDICATE AGAINST OR VAPOR TRAIL. INDICATES IF THE PHENOMENA WAS MOVING." Beneath that, there is a hand-drawn sketch of an elliptical or oval-shaped object with some text written underneath it.

The text in the document states:
