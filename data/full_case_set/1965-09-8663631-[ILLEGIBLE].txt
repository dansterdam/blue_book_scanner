As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and transcribe the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):            Yes           No            Don't Know.           IF you answered YES, then tell what

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color

18. With a match, show me angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any data is of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically show trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The text output from the document is as follows:

1. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

2. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

3. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The text in the document is as follows:

26 November 1965

Mr Hunt/an/SAFVOI/PS/24 Nov 65

Dear Mr. Hunt,

This is in reply to your letter regarding aerial objects which you observed on the night of 27 September 1965.

Your letter is similar to many another reports we have received. The light from satellites is caused by reflection from the sun, and the satellites are in orbits, so attempts were made to identify the specific objects observed.

List your information. It is believed the way satellites are illuminated and the orbital data on them would explain the UFO project.

I hope this information will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

J. Allen Hynek
Astronomer
Community Liaison Division
Department of the Air Force

UFO SIGHTING, 27 SEP 65

TO: USAF SAFOJCO (Mrs Hunt)
REFERENCE: YOUR ATTACHED LETTER DATED 5 OCT 65 IN WHICH YOU REQUESTED THAT A COPY UNDER GO YOUR VIEW. THE UNCLASSIFIED FILE COPY OF THIS REPORT WAS FORWARDED TO MRS HUNT AS REQUESTED ON THE DATE OF 5 OCT 65. 

SUMMARY: ON THE NIGHT OF 27 SEP 65, A USAF OFFICER STATIONED AT RICHARDS-GEBAUR AFB, MISSOURI OBSERVED AN OBJECT IN THE SKY FROM HIS HOME. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING ELLIPTICAL IN SHAPE AND MOVING RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SKY FROM WEST TO EAST. IT WAS REPORTED TO BE EMITTING A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT THAT COULD BE SEEN FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE. THE OFFICER STATED THAT HE COULD NOT IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC OBJECT. HE BELIEVED IT WAS SOME TYPE OF AIRCRAFT BUT DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS. THEREFORE, IT IS PROBABLE THAT HIS SIGHTING CONSTITUTES AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

THE PERSON SAID THAT HE NOTICED THE OBJECT HOVERING OVER THE TREES AND STOPPED HIS CAR TO OBSERVE IT. HE SAID THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ROUND OR CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND WAS A DULL SILVER OR GREY COLOR. HE SAID THAT IT WAS ABOUT FIFTY TO SIXTY FEET IN DIAMETER AND THAT IT WAS HOVERING AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. HE SAID THAT IT SEEMED TO BE ROTATING SLOWLY AS IT HOVERED. 

HE SAID THAT HE WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND THAT DURING THAT TIME IT MADE NO NOISE AND DID NOT SEEM TO BE PROPELLED BY ANY VISIBLE MEANS. HE SAID THAT WHEN HE FIRST OBSERVED IT, IT WAS HOVERING MOTIONLESS, BUT THAT IT THEN BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION. HE SAID THAT AS IT MOVED, IT MAINTAINED THE SAME ALTITUDE AND THAT IT APPEARED TO BE GLIDING OR DRIFTING RATHER THAN POWERED FLIGHT. HE SAID THAT AFTER MOVING FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE, IT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED.

HE SAID THAT HE WAS VERY SURPRISED AND PUZZLED BY WHAT HE SAW AND THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE. HE SAID THAT HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT THAT WOULD MATCH THE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HE SAW.
