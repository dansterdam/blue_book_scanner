UFO REPORT
In light of the above, our conclusions strongly suggest that the object observed was a balloon.
References paragraph 3 of your basic correspondence. From the information regarding subject observa- tion, it appears that he not only has a dizzy-active imagination, and apparently continues making a nuisance of himself to the 551st and other units concerning UFO sightings that get him nowhere.
That he should report all UFO sightings to the nearest Air Force unit, preferably a 4602nd unit, and not the 551st.
The 551st Air Force in Kennewick sighting; the information is being used as part of the list in connection with other current and analysis of similar sightings and identification of these unidentified aerial objects; and that his interest in the matter is not highly recommended.
Further, he should be informed in a rather firm manner that as an officer of the law he is personally aware of the legal consequences of this incident if it is reported immediately - it is of limited value for investigation.
A standard USAF UFO questionnaire together with form AFOIN-4D should be sent to you in accordance with a request that although late for proper processing, the data would be desirable for consideration of the case. A personal interview by some member of your field unit would be desirable in that it will contribute appropriately to a study and make observation of the type of persqn reporting incidents.

Re: Unidentified Flying Objects

Dear Sir:

The following information was furnished to Special Agent Clement W. Parkhurst, resident agent, Richland, Washington, on June 1, 1956:

Sergeant Gordon Richardson, Kennewick, Washington Police Department, advised that about a year ago while on duty he observed a bright light moving across the sky over Kennewick, Washington. Richardson estimated that the light moved at a speed of approximately 2000 to 3000 feet per second or more. Richardson stated that the light had at least two different kinds of motors to propel it and it was emitting a "white glow" of the engine sounding like a tractor engine and apparently an internal combustion engine. 

Richardson stated that about a year ago he was on night shift when he observed a large, shining, metallic ball about 30 feet in diameter moving across the sky at a very high rate of speed and when it got about three blocks east of Richardson's location it seemed to pause or stop and then moved on at a complete breakaway speed easterly at an estimated 2000 to 3000 feet per second or more. 

Richardson stated that the ball had lost a trail of light until it dropped slowly down and made a very slight and gradual turn to the north and then on out of sight. Richardson advised that this was definitely not a jet or other aircraft, and he has no other explanation as to what this object could have been. Richardson pressed his remarks but assures the writer that this is not so.

The information furnished seems to have been weighing very heavily on his mind and he believes the information should be passed on to the Air Station or other interested Defense Agency.

Re: Unidentified Flying Objects

Date: June 12, 1956

ball stood still several minutes and then took off with a speed so great that it disappeared. Richardson stated that obviously some different type of engine was utilized in flight such as a jet engine because of the speed of the ball. Richardson noted no fire or smoke on leaving.

Richardson stated the most disturbing thing to him is that apparently the builders of the ball have mastered the pull of gravity. He stated that this fact most likely cost this country a poor position defensively as the ball obviously either came from Russia or some extraspace planet. In which case this Russian might now bid for world domination. Richardson stated that by any known United States device, the United States does not have this ball or any device like it propelling with a high degree of intelligence. Richardson stated that he believes that whoever produces this ball had to have just about perfect control of all natural phenomena such as light waves. He stated he never saw the ball again and has not advised other persons other than the FBI. He also stated that he did not hear of anyone else seeing the ball but commented that this be to his continuing he is a skilled observer.

The above is for your information and no investigation is being made by this office. There is no objection by this office to your investigation of this matter and your interview of Sergeant Gordon Richardson.

Very truly yours,

Re: Unidentified Flying Objects

Dear Sir:

On June 12, 1955, a letter was directed to your office reporting information, previously given to the Kennewick, Washington Police Department, relating to an incident of an unidentified flying object sighting. This information has continued to cause interest and questioning of the Air Force concerning his original reporting of this incident and has been described that it is not conclusive to the representative of the Air Force concerning his observations of this unidentified flying object sighting as related to us.
It is desired that this letter pass on to the appropriate representatives of the Air Force. S/Sgt. Richardson has been advised that his original information was turned over to your office and that you, in turn, have submitted contents will also be discussed with Major Russell Womack of your office on October 9, 1955 and his suggested that this letter be forwarded. 

Sincerely yours,
