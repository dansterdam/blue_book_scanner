REMARKS Saucer Tales Fly
"Saucer Tales Fly" begins with a report that objects described as "saucers" have been observed flying around the country at more than 1,000 miles per hour. According to the witness, the objects first appeared to be fighter planes, but then accelerated at a phenomenal rate and were soon out of sight. There is also a report of a dark-gray object hovering over a former artillery observer's home, which then suddenly disappeared.
