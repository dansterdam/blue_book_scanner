A woman, wife of a U.F.O. spotter, came to Chester, Pa., on Feb. 6th, at 2:43 P.M. and observed the usual lights and sound of a U.F.O. for some 13 minutes before it left the area. It was silent and went straight up. It seemed to be stationary and was first seen in the north western sky and went into the north eastern sky. The object was not an airplane or a meteorite according to the witness.

Dear Sir,

I would like to report the "Saucer" sightings I observed from my home, on Feb 6th, at 10:30 P.M. which I observed for about 10 minutes.

It was a very bright light, disc-shaped, hovering about 100 yards from my home, making no noise whatsoever. My binoculars and your telescope were also in use at the same time, and they confirmed what I saw.

The size of the Saucer, as I first observed it, would be about 1/2 of the size of the Full Moon. It remained stationary for several minutes, then it moved slightly to the left about 100 yards, then it moved back to the original position. It then suddenly took off at a terrific speed, straight up and out of sight. It made no noise whatsoever.

Since then, I have told several of my neighbors, but since they did not see it, they could hardly believe me. I am a little shaky, but since I care nothing for publicity, I am advising you where the incident took place, and may we will someday find out what it really was.

Sincerely yours,
MR. JOSEPH GREER
Chester, Penn.
