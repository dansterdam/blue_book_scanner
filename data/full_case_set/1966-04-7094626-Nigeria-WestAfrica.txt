3 April 1966
305, Report

National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Cape Kennedy, Florida

Dear Sir,

Please forgive the lack of direction in the above letterhead. I trust it will be enough.

On 3 April, at 8:30 A.M., I was watching for satellites. A most unusual device crossed directly overhead on an easterly course.

The time was approximately 8:30 A.M. and two hours later made a most unusual. The first was its speed. In the 50 to 60 degrees of arc through which it traveled it went faster than one minutes dispelled.

The other was that it blinked very brightly at a rate of about two per second. It seemed to be about the size of a satellite spark and when directly overhead, much brighter.

The color of the light was that of a white star.

I have more than 4,000 hrs flying time, including U.S.A.F. Those with me (F-84G) were equally impressed.

It is very quiet here and high flying jets are easily heard. There was no sound whatsoever.

I would be very interested to hear from you if you have any information on this object. If this was a known satellite or an aircraft, my opinion was neither a satellite nor an aircraft.

Sincerely,

Bob Bailey
