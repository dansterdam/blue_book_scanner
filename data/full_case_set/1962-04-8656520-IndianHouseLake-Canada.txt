PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 4 June 1952
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 30/0130Z
5. PHOTOS: Yes
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: About 1.5 hours
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: A bright, round, fast-moving object about the size of a star was observed at an altitude of 80-90 degrees above the horizon, moving at an estimated speed of 600 mph in a straight, horizontal path for a distance of 30 degrees. Observation through telescope.
11. COMMENTS: Based on observed characteristics, this appears to be an absolute posting of something unusual. It seemed to be a vehicle of some type as it had a distinctive shape, was luminous, and moved at a very high speed in a straight path, indicating controlled flight. The observation was made by a competent observer with experience in observing meteorological phenomena and astronomical objects. This should be considered as a possible observation of a flying vehicle of unknown origin. Further investigation is warranted.
