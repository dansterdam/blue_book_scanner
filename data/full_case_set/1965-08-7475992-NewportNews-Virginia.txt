As analysis of the object would be difficult since the object disappeared from sight almost immediately, whether the sun was still in a position to be the direct object, or whether the object disappeared to the sun, or a combination thereof. It is impossible, however, to an unpracticed eye to make any determination of altitude. If the object had remained visible for a sufficient length of time, weather or research observations might have provided some data, but the great "G" forces that the object would experience precluded any physical evidence.
