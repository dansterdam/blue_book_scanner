REPLY TO
SUBJECT: Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program
TO: HQ USAF (AFCXN)
1. Reference is made to your letter of 7 December 1959 above, subject as stated.
2. Our review of the USAF Aerial Phenomena Program, including the project carried out relating to phenomena reported, indicates that more than half of the program relates to phenomena of a non-scientific nature. Considering the quality of data available from other sources, exploitation of the aerial phenomena observations would not significantly enhance our research programs.
3. For the reason stated above, it do not believe that the transfer of the USAF Aerial Phenomena Program to ARDC is in the best interest of the Air Force.

1. The Air Force Regulation SR 200-2, "Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO)," dated 14 September 1959, requires the investigation and analysis of "unidentified flying objects" and establishes procedures to be followed in the conduct of such investigations.
2. In compliance with the requirements of this regulation, it has been decided to intensify the program directed toward determining the scientific, technical, and operational characteristics of these reported objects. To accomplish this, it has been necessary to determine the extent of any threat to national security which these reported objects may represent.
3. It is my opinion that any future value to the Air Force lies in the possible scientific or technical characteristics of these objects. I therefore recommend that action be taken to transfer the aerial phenomena program which now involves ATIC, ASD, AFOIN, AFCIN to the Research and Development Command.

    Air Research-Development Command
    Andrews AFB, Wash., D.C.

1. Reference Air Force Regulation No. 200-2, subject, "Unidentified Flying Objects," dated 14 September 1959.

2. On 16 July the USAF assumed responsibility for a program of investigation of unidentified flying objects over the United States. This program was designed to determine if these phenomena constitute a threat to our national security, and first, if these phenomena were hostile, and second, had any possible scientific value. A further objective was to determine the nature of each of these reported objects.

3. With the change of the (CO-2) designation that has been no indication that the basic mission of this program has changed. After review of the twelve year record of the intelligence division of the project, it has been determined that the program has developed along lines progressively more scientific in nature.

4. It is my opinion that any future value to the Air Force lies in exploitation of these phenomena for scientific purposes rather than as an intelligence function. With your concurrence, I propose that the program be transferred to your command. This will provide the USAF program with three full-time USAF personnel and one scientific consultant in each agency within your command that you may deem appropriate.

DRAFT
SUBJECT: UFO Program
TO: APTR (General Walsh)

1. Since 1947 the Air Force, and more specifically the ATIC, has been responsible for a program designed to determine if unidentified flying objects were a national threat or had any scientific value. This program at its inception was designed to determine if UFO's were hostile, and had any possible scientific value. A tertiary objective was to determine the nature of each of these objects with the passage of time the absence of positive indication that these objects were hostile or had any scientific value, and the coming of the UFO's the third objective began to take on more nature. Today this objective has grown to such an extent that we are fast reaching the point where the till was the dog. This is a possible great danger to the Air Force prestige and certainly a danger to the intelligence community.

2. The attached study offers as a solution transfer of the UFO project to ARDC with aims toward eventual complete elimination as a special project. I concur with the views outlined in the study that such a move would be beneficial to both the intelligence community and to the UFO program. Disassociation with intelligence would do much to strip the aura of mystery from the UFO program, and the same disassociation would eliminate a project from intelligence which is more or less open to public inspection.

3. It is suggested that the attached study be approved and forwarded to the Air Force Chief of Staff with a recommendation for consideration and possible implementation.

STUDY BY ATIC-SID
FLYING OBJECTS 2 OCTOBER 1959 (BLUE BOOK)
PROBLEM:
To determine if the unidentified flying objects reported in this area would be beneficially classified as a project designed to determine if unidentified flying objects constitute a threat to the United States. This requires from the original intent, that the unidentified objects would be beneficially. This progres for from the original intent, has become an undue burden upon the United States reconnaissance, intelligence, and security services, and has resulted in unwarranted publicity for the air Force - a chain more serious, embarrassing and discrediting than the original problem itself.
FACTORS BEARING ON THE PROBLEM:
5. As of 2 July 1959, 12 years of investigating and analyzing every unidentified flying object which was brought to its attention, the Air Force has accumulated a total of 12,618 sightings from various sources (6m - 4m - from this vast experience with UFOs, the Air Force has failed to determine conclusively that the objects sighted represent interstellar or interplanetary alien beings from another world, nor has any real scientific and/or technical information of value been gathered.
6. There are 30 private UFO organizations in the United States whose members exploit unidentified flying objects sightings for commercial, political, or publicity purposes. There have been instances when the members of these organizations have actually contacted the Air Force by telephone and have demanded that certain actions be taken, after having instructed the witnesses to complain to their Congressmen. These complaints have resulted in the Congressional investigations and unfavorable publicity described.
7. The methods by which UFO reports are forwarded to by "tip or telephone or mail from citizens (all U.S.) This, when compared with the reaction time required to investigations these reports, is time-consuming and delaying. The solution would be to route all such reports from private citizens directly to the ATIC, thus eliminating the present practice of referring them to local, regional, or state law enforcement agencies. Only the ATIC intelligence or scientific and/or technical personnel recognizes the importance of these reports and should be the agency authorized to investigate them.
8. The approximately 60% of the effort in the UFO program is directed toward the public relations objective.
9. The ATIC has a staff of three people who work full-time on the UFO program, and there are no other USAF personnel considered full-time with the program.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

PROGRAM: In addition to these full time, or nearly full time people, there are a great number in the field who must meet the problems of this program on a wide basis (102 officers). Since 1947 this program has accumulated in the amount of work considerably which is outlined in the annual reports. The annual average for the average man's services has been 1,500. In 1922 a statistical study was made regarding the cost of running the program by the Air Force and the listed expenses must be added the operating expenses which can be directly attributed to this program. For all these expenses, the average annual cost is currently estimated to be $33,000.

DISCUSSIONS: 

1. Immediate elimination of the program. To do this would result in disastrous public relations and from the point of view of the public and the press and propaganda. In addition to arousing the confirmed UFO believers, it would virtually destroy the public interest which has been built up over the past years, while the eventual elimination is to be sought as a goal. It must be understood that this public interest would be very difficult to regain at a later date.

2. Reduce the program to a specific agency, by no means restricting it to the Air Force. It appears that the Air Force will not continue this effort in a manner which will satisfy the public and the scientific community. An orderly transfer and reduction of the program and its activities would have to be accomplished in such a manner as to avoid reports of any objects, which may prove hostile, to be intelligence and/or counterintelligence vehicles. The media and public interest which would suffer any abrupt discontinuance of the program.

3. Remove the UFO program from the intelligence community with plans for transferring it to a research and development unit or existing agency. This would have the advantage of moving the project out of the intelligence community which poses the problems of military intelligence. Second, it would eliminate to a large degree the intelligence responsibilities, both in reports and in the official posture, which has been one mainly of public relations. The program could be moved to the scientific community where effort could be expended more along the lines of answering the public interest rather than to providing data for intelligence.

4. Reorganize the entire program under the Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E). This would serve both to strengthen the scientific effort and to place the program in a position where it could more fully utilise all of the available technology. This arrangement would also serve to inform the public and the press of the official interest and intentions regarding the UFO phenomena. The program's activities could be made more on the order of a special research project, thereby providing greater security control and direction to the data acquisitions, and at the same time serving to answer the two major objectives of the program - scientific investigation and meeting public interest. A study program should be undertaken to determine the best organization and the true cause for the concern over these unidentified objects. This plan should make specific correlations to determine, if possible, the cause for the continuing public interest in this program.

OUTPUT OF OCR:

SUMMARY OF REPORTS (This would serve a dual purpose by allowing anticipation of the types and kinds of reports which might be received under this program, and also by giving heavy consideration to the psychological aspects of the program. Should the project now under consideration become unclassified, this report should also give heavy consideration to the psychological aspects involved making for a program that will be acceptable to the public.

The report should give such consideration to the following:

1. The best immediate solution to the UFO program is to discontinue the program. This recommendation is made to the ASAF with SAFIS, AFCIN, and AIS-4n. The program under BLUE BOOK should be eliminated as a specific project.

2. It is recommended that this study be suppressed and forwarded to the ASAF. If for consideration, this is the proposed action: It is recommended to the Air Force Chief of Staff for consideration and possible disapproval of the AFOIR-11.8 project, which is currently unclassified and has become increasingly difficult to maintain in a covert manner.

I. PROBLEM:
1. Examine the current unidentified flying objects program, as conducted by the United States Air Force structure.

II. FACTORS BEARING ON THE PROBLEM:
A. In 1947 the Air Force established a project whose purpose was to collect, evaluate, and distribute all information concerning sightings and phenomena in the atmosphere which could be construed to be of concern to the national security and which might represent technological or scientific developments foreign to our knowledge. This project, designated as Project Sign, was the first centralized effort of the Air Force to deal with unidentified flying object sightings brought to its attention. The Air Force has accumulated a considerable number of case histories of such sightings (DAS-A1). From this vast experience with UFOs, the Air Force has not had, as yet, any conclusive scientific evidence that the physical nature of these flying objects represents technological developments foreign to our present knowledge.

B. The UFO program, far from its original intent of determining the intelligence and scientific characteristics of these objects, has become more of a documentary project. This distortion of what was its basic objective is probably due to the fact that the Air Force is concerned more with containing the harmful effects of public alarm or panic which might result from knowledge which the members exploit unidentified flying objects for financial gain, or religious conviction, or other psychological reasons.

C. The UFO project requires manpower and resources which ATIC might use constructively on other urgent problems. ATIC presently has a staff of three people who work full time on the UFO project, and several others who meet the problems of this program on a day to day basis (TAB-C). Since the project has contributed no scientific data which warrant continuation of the activity, as a scientific consultant, I feel that it could be discontinued and its resources more effectively utilized.

in the person of Dr. J. Allen Hynek. The annual average for Dr. Hynek's experiences has been 2 since 1952 (statistical study of his program) was performed by a civilian contractor. This indicates the large number of air force commitments and operations which can be directly attributed to the UFO program must be added.

1. Retain the program at ATIC and direct the major efforts. The major advantages of this solution is that the project has been associated for a long time at ATIC and the accumulated background of the original objectives. The major disadvantages are that the project is less open to public inspection, and the association of ATIC has become to some degree a handicap to the program. There would be no requirement to establish new lines of communication and/or control.

2. Transfer the UFO project to one of the sub-divisions of RAND. This solution would require the establishment of new directives, and for the sub-divisions of the Air Force becoming familiar with the problem. The responsibility for this full program would probably be accomplished by granting of this contract to RAND. The project would be assigned to a less publicized subdivision, and education on the UFO program would best be conducted by RAND. There are some disadvantages, however, since extensive coordination would be required.

Between the big TITLE and the NOTES, there is text that discusses the objectives of the project. There appears to be a requirement for the project objectives to become familiar with new responsibilities and a new method of operation. 

The text also mentions the direct association between the intelligence community and the UFO project, stating that this program should not be burdened with this task as it has such strong communistic implications. It suggests that this program could lead to a positive exposure of the UFO phenomena to the public, which could strip it of its aura of mystery.

Finally, the text discusses the conclusion, stating that the assignment of the UFO project to an agency with scientific capability is logical, and experience has shown that intelligence agencies should utilize this program to enhance the success of the assignment.

30 November 1959

1. In the fall of 1947 the United States Air Force took official notice of reports of unidentified flying objects. Responsibility for the UFO project was assigned to the Intelligence community.

2. The project as established was to determine first, if UFO's were hostile, second, had they any scientific value, and third, to determine the nature of each of these objects. After 12 years, 6152 cases, and more than 8000 reports, the Air Force has not discovered any evidence which would indicate that UFO's are internal or pose a security threat in any way.

3. During the life of this project there have been indications of its possible scientific value. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, former scientific consultant to the project, now reports as possible sub- stantiating evidence. Dr. Charles F. Olivier, President of The American Meteor Society, has on several occasions requested information from the Air Force to be used for his studies on "Fireball Meteors". Dr. Olivier claims the Air Force information is more complete than his own reports. The UFO files contain reports of cases which were analyzed as being due to rare scientific phenomena such as "ball lightning".

4. In the absence of a security threat from UFO's, it is my opinion that the project's value to the Air Force lies in exploitation of its scientific information. In order to accomplish this goal the UFO program should be transferred to ARDC, and its scientific objectives clearly defined.

STUDY BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
PROJECT 10073 (BLUE BOOK)

I. PROBLEM:
To analyze the current unidentified flying object program as compared to the mission and capabilities of the US Air Force, to determine its proper orientation.

II. FACTORS BEARING ON THE PROBLEM:

A. In 1947 the Air Force established a project whose purpose was to collect, collate, evaluate, and distribute to interested government agencies and organizations information concerning observations or objects designated as "Unidentified Flying Objects". This action was taken as of 23 June 1947, after 14 years of investigating and analyzing every significant report of UFO's (then designated as "flying discs"), better known since 1950, for many objects were reported from more than one source, as "unidentified flying objects" (UFOS).

B. The UfO program, far from its original intent or determining the nature of these objects, has apparently acquired a primary objective of providing the public information. This duplication of public information has in some instances resulted in the release of incomplete information, and in a few cases scientific findings have not been made available to the public.

C. The UFO program, while maintaining the original objective of attempting to identify and analyze technical and scientific aspects of the reported phenomena, has since 1949 occupied organization space and used personnel and supplies out of proportion to the importance of the original objectives. It has been noted that when members of these organizations have actually competed with the Air Force mission, they have not contributed data to the Air Force for evaluation but have relied on their own analysis and conclusions.

D. The UFO project requires manpower and resources which ATIC might use to better advantage on other programs. ATlC presently has a staff of three people who work full time on the UFO project, and several others who devote a portion of their time to it. In addition, the project has required the expenditure of scientific effort and funds which could be more profitably used to meet the problems of this program on a day to day basis (R-D). Since this project had contracted the services of scientific consultant, these demands have materially expanded.

- page 19 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document discussing the Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program to investigate UFO sightings.

In the person of Dr. J. Allen Hynek: The annual average for Dr. Hynek's services has been $2,000. In 1957, a statistical study of the program was performed by a civilian subcontractor. This study cost the Air Force approximately $2,000, which can be directly attributed to the UFO program.

There are several solutions to the problem of proper orientation of the UFO objects toward a ATIC and direct the major efforts toward these ends. Some solutions discussed involve performing analytical studies, detailed examinations, and interpreting visual sightings. The major advantage of this solution is that the program has been established to a higher mathematical and scientific level. This would require more stringent requirements to establish new lines of communication and/or increase the number of qualified scientific personnel. This solution would provide for a more detailed and comprehensive analysis of UFO reports and would increase the possibility of solutions to some operational and scientific problems.

Another solution is to transfer the UFO project from the intelligence community to another agency and establish a separate organization. This approach may allow a fresh approach by an organization which would not be burdened by preconceived notions and which could possibly take on a more positive attitude, and association with the scientific community. There are certain disadvantages to this solution which should be considered. There are certain advantages which could result from a separation of the UFO project from the intelligence community, such as new directives, and for the sub-divisions of the Air Force becoming familiar with the specific capabilities in this area.

This solution is one of the sub-divisions of WAFF - transfer the UFO project to one of the sub-divisions of WAFF. Responsibility for the full program could probably be accomplished by a sub-division of the Air Force. The project could be assumed by an existing division, or a new division could be activated, using Air Force personnel. Evaluation on the UFO program would best be conducted by WAFF. There are some disadvantages however, since certain directives would be required.

between the UFO office and AFCIN, AIC, and ATIC in order to accomplish the primary objectives of the project. There would also be a requirement for new requisition and the administrative support of the AF force would have to be obtained. In addition, the UFO program would lose prestige due to its association with intelligence.

By limitation of the direct association between the Intelligence community and the UFO project findings, the Intelligence community would be unable to carry on a continuing overacquisition of public relations. Also, it has been pointed out more than once during the course this project that intelligence support would be a limitation in accomplishing this mission for obvious reasons. Intelligence would do much to accomplish this as it cannot take part directly due to the military intelligence nature of the project.

These means are a threat or potential threat to our national security program and cannot be overlooked. This objective could be fulfilled again with the knowledge available. This objective would be the same basic program as now except that the means would be accomplished by other means than intelligence. The reason is that the present means are a threat or potential threat to our national security program and cannot be overlooked.

IV. CONCLUSION:

The intelligence portion of the UFO project to be an agency with a scientific capability, i.e. ATIC, is the most logical organization of the program it is believed. This is substantiated in that the program requires the scientific organization which ATIC represents. Since the interpretation of intelligence data and the experience to evaluate such observations is necessary, it would appear that the assignment to intelligence was very logical. Experience to date with this intelligence organization indicates that it will not permit information to leak except in a manner which will not injure the official objectives and has the technical facilities and knowledge required to assist the scientific objectives of the project. To examine the success of this reassignment, the scientific objectives of the project should be more clearly defined.

V. ACTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. It is recommended that this study be approved and the necessary steps taken for possible implementation. Such approval should be accompanied by authorization of the draft document which is attached. A study of this nature should be undertaken in phase with Atomic Energy Commission requirements.

1. In 1957 the Air Force, and more specifically the ATIC, assumed responsibility for a program designed to determine if unidentified flying objects were a national threat. This program at its inception was designed to determine if UFOs were hostile, and second, had any possible scientific value. A tertiary objective was to determine the nature of each of these objects.

This is damaging to Air Force prestige and has a detrimental effect upon intelligence operations.

I concur with the views outlined in the study that such a move would be beneficial to both the intelligence community and to the UFO program. Dissociation with intelligence would do much to strip the aura of mystery from the UFO program, and the same dissociation would eliminate a project from intelligence which is more suited for public inspection.

I. BRIEF HISTORY.

In the fall of 1947 the United States Air Force took official notice of a rising number of reports of unidentified flying objects. These became popularly known as "flying saucers" because they represented, to the general public, a possible threat to national security and had to be investigated. The Air Force established Project "Sign" to collect and evaluate all UFO sightings.

II. UFO PROGRAM:

1. Determine if these objects constitute a threat to national security.
2. Determine if any scientific and/or technical information was available from the sightings.
3. Identify and/or explain all UFO sightings.

In January 1947 until February 1949, the program was identified as Project "Sign". In December 1948, the name was changed to Project "Grudge". In September 1951, the name was changed to Project "Blue Book".

D. As of 30 June 1959, after 12 years of investigating and analyzing reports, the Air Force has accumulated a file of 12,618 cases. The number of reports received under Project "Blue Book" is increasing. However, the number of sightings over the past three years has been downward. This decline for the period since 1 January 1956, is shown in the statistics for TAS *. Another factor which adds to uncertainty requirements is that individuals frequently neglect to report sightings. And millions have been educated to be alert for the 21c phenomena.

"The Unidentified Flying Objects Research Committee  
September 2, 1959

Major General W.H. Blair, Director 
Intelligence, United States Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear General Blair:

Enclosed is a complete report of a UPC sighting. It includes a description of the sighting, the conclusions of ATIC as given in your letter to Congressman Bender, and an analysis of the Air Force treatment of this case.

In the analysis of the Air Force treatment of this case our group has concluded that the investigation was insufficient. This case is typical of all UPO cases and that our charges apply generally to the Air Force treatment of reports.

You have answered many inquiries from members of the U.S. Congress indicating that the Air Force is thoroughly investigating UFO reports. We are presenting you with this report which proves that your statements have been false and that your treatment of UFO reports is inadequate for your purposes.

After reading the enclosed report, please send us your answer to the following questions:

(1) What action will be taken to discipline the ATIC investigation of this case?
(2) What action will be taken to take a proper investigation and evaluation of reports (Regulations 200-2 of Sept. 14, 1959)?
(3) What action will be taken to insure that all future reports of unidentified flying objects will be properly investigated and evaluated?

A reply to this letter at your earliest convenience would be appreciated. We await your reply to the above three questions.

Sincerely,

Fred A. Eichhart
For the UFO Research Committee"

Dear Mr. Kinsley:

Your letter of September 29th, concerning information relating to material allegedly observed by Pilot John W. Brister, has been referred to me.

The Air Force has made a thorough check of all reported sightings of unidentified flying objects in the Pensacola, Florida, area on September 11, 1959, the date mentioned in your letter, and no reliable report of such a sighting has been received.

I have reviewed the official reports of the scientific analysis made by Air Force personnel, and have found no evidence to support the claim that an unidentified flying object was observed on that date in that area.

Much of the descriptive material in your letter appears to be hearsay, and we have not been able to develop any factual data to substantiate the report. 

While the Air Force is always interested in reports of genuine unidentified flying objects, we cannot take official cognizance of reports which appear to be unsupported by reliable evidence.

I trust this information is responsive to your inquiry.

Sincerely yours,

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

Dear Mr. Kinch:

Your letter, dated 26 July 1959, addressed to Senator Bricber
on the subject of unidentified flying objects has been referred to
this office for reply.

The report referred to in your first question is now-classified.
The Air Force has consistently stated that there is a complete lack
of evidence to substantiate the existence of interplanetary spaceships.
The former reports of the scientific physical evidence referred to in your
second question have not been fully declassified for security reasons. 
However, the classified portion of the panel's final report does not
deal specifically with the nature or the character or intelligence
significance which affect the national security. The releasable
portion of the report which you already have been sent with unidentified
flying object cases.

Also, I can assure you that the Final Report of the Panel does not
recommend that the Air Force relinquish its UFO investigative efforts
and all UFO information to the general public.

Your third question is rather difficult to answer. The United
States does not possess a flying saucer as such. However, as you
mentioned in your letter, many devices which we do possess, such
as weather balloons, jet aircraft and missiles, can be mistaken for
an unidentified flying object under unusual circumstances.

Senator Griffen-Ohio
Senate Office Building
Washington, D.C.

Dear Senator Frickers,

Col. J. L. may a "ake an inquiry with the U.S. Air Force
intelligence concerning the questions I wish answered concerning the Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.
"QUESTION 2"
"The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects"
Captain Ruppelt tells of a "100 feet diameter object" of the
"Elliptical" shape with a "dull-orange glow" projecting from it. 
According to Ruppelt, this report states that the UFO are apparently space vehicles. This report was time in late 1949, and Ruppelt says that "No one knew what it was, and no one knows what it is today".

Question 2 - I referred to another report which describes the
sighted on January 7, 1953. It appears that (1) that the reports more than 6 years old, (2) that the details are sketched and may not be accurate, and (3) that the public be given an
the facts in the UFO mystery. The "Project Blue Book" report which is to be unidentified
 Flying Objects" released April 9, 1956 by the Air Force is descriptive but does not give the actual facts.

The public in my opinion is entitled to the true facts known to the Air Force. I hope you can take this matter up with the Air Force to have the actual facts made available to the public.

II. Method of Operation.
A. The method of operating the UFO program has been generally the same since its birth: reporting, investigating, analyzing, and publishing each of these functions, and to what extent, that the program has changed.
As in reporting: the nearest Air Force or other government or military station or agency is notified of the sighting report. Some reports are forwarded directly to the Air Force by civil agencies or private individuals.
The investigations are conducted by the Air Base or station nearest the sighting, either directly or through a district field investigator. They are considered important cases the investigation, upon ATIC request, is conducted by the investigator organization. In some instances the investigation is conducted by the ATIC.
B. Monitoring the records and maintaining the records is the responsibility of the ATIC.
C. The program acts on the information pertaining to UFO's, which is for public consumption, is the responsibility of the Secretary of the Air Force.
D. The Program Policy:
1. The present efforts extended in the conduct of the UFO project are directed toward specific goals:
a. To exploit every means of acquiring the maximum possible intelligence and/or scientific information.
b. To establish a less defensive attitude which has been allowed to creep into the program's public relations philosophy (the attitude which allows subject matter to be controversial cannot be a space.
c. To inform the public that a specific program, such as the UFO project, exists and activities relating to it are essentially for national security. The USAF, in the conduct of its overall mission, will consider and analyze any phenomena that may affect the National Defense (sic) of the United States and those who are in a position to assist in the intelligence and/or scientific value will receive this added attention.
2. To help the general public towards a better understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of the problems through which many innocent people are duped by those who are using the UFO for personal gains by a program of public education.

Dear Mr. Ruppelt:

I have to bring to your attention the interest of Mr. William Plummer in the sighting of an unidentified flying object which he claims was seen by a number of people on or about 11 September 1959.

Mr. Plummer was disturbed by the fact that apparently no official investigation was made of this incident.

This investigation revealed that a military aircraft had been engaged in a high altitude training flight in the area at the time of the incident. The aircraft was operating at a very high altitude and its appearance may have caused the unidentified sighting.

The investigator was that the confusion and misidentification was understandable under the conditions existing at the time.

Mr. Plummer was advised of the result of the investigation and he indicated that he was satisfied that a reasonable explanation had been provided for the incident.

Respectfully,
A. P. Rambert, Jr.

Dear Mr. Hennessey:

I refer to your inquiry concerning the sighting of Mrs. William Fitzgerald of Sheffield lake, Ohio, concerning an unidentified flying object on 21 September 1958.

Air Force investigators arrived in Sheffield, Ohio, on 3 October 1958, conducted an investigation, and took statements of the witnesses to possibly evaluate this sighting.

Investigation revealed that a peculiar event was seen in the home of Mrs. Fitzgerald. The edge of Mrs. Fitzgerald's illuminating a small square on the ground at approximately the same hour of the reported sighting. The train had a rotating headlight which, under some conditions, would produce unusual effects. However, the train was actually over 2 miles away from the location of the Lorial Case. Chief Schott reported that he was using his spotlight in an attempt to attract the attention of a another ship, and that the light was directed towards the ground.

Conclusion: Air Force investigators did not find this sighting to be of sufficient significance for further investigation.

USAF UFO PROGRAM

I. Brief History.-
In the fall of 1947, the United States Air Force took official notice of the public interest in unidentified flying objects. Sightings had become the subject of public concern. The Air Force was designated to investigate and evaluate such reports.

B. On 30 December 1947, the Air Material Command established a project to collect and evaluate all information concerning sightings of unidentified flying objects. The objectives of this project were to determine if such objects constituted a threat to national security.

1. Determine if these objects constitute a threat to national security.
2. Determine if any scientific and/or technical information was available.
3. Identify and/or explain all UFO sightings.

D. As of 31 June 1959, after 12 years of investigation and analysis, the project was discontinued. The findings were that the Air Force had been unable to identify the objects as posing a threat to national security, although some individual sightings remained unexplained. The totals for the more recent years, however, are still far above the totals for the earlier years. The increased interest by the public has resulted in more sightings being reported.

- page 54 -

There is no photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book document. 

The text of the document is as follows:

II. Method of Operation

As mentioned in operating the UFO program has been generally the same since its inception in 1952. Although it is only in which agencies of the Air Force have performed this function, it is considered that too many people have access to these records and no centralization of activities is done. The program as presented at this time, 29 SEP 1959, is as follows:

1. Reporting
Reports of alleged sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena are reported to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, either by military or by private citizens.

2. Investigation
The initial investigations are conducted by the air base or station personnel or others reporting the sightings. In the more unusual or complex cases, these investigations are conducted by the 1127th USAF Special Activities Squadron, specially designated by the ATIC.

3. Monitoring
Monitoring the processing, analysis, and maintaining the records is the responsibility of the ATIC.

4. The release of all current information relating to UFOs, which is in the responsibility of the Secretary of the Air Force.

B. The Program Today.

Today one of the major aims in the conduct of this program is to eliminate the curiosity which has been aroused in the public mind, which tends to inflame public interest and to distort objective analysis. It is not the space to educate the public to the existence of UFOs, but rather to educate them to the realization that each object sighted is not necessarily evidence of an interplanetary origin. Such aims as to educate the public to evaluate each UFO sighting not essential, and the Air Force does not consider such a program necessary. The panel is composed of experts in the following areas:

Physicist
Psychologist
Astronomer
Public Relations

education program, using the media of the newspapers, to inform the
public of the probable causes for those sightings which receive wide-
spread publicity other general information on the program.

2. To heighten the probability of accomplishment of these
ATIC's governement directed objectives, the new directive should improve the reporting procedures and investigation techniques of
this program. A special field investigation procedure has been established. (Special Study Report 21b).
A statistical study of the program covering the years
1947-1952 has been made. Sufficient data has been obtained to assist in determining if the project could be generally improved. This study indicates that the validity of sightings reported to the project is very high, that the public's cooperation and air crew reporting is good, and that improvements can be made in communications and evaluation. Finally it is believed that an education program using the media of newspapers, can be
effective. This education program, using the media of the newspapers, to inform the
public of the probable causes for those sightings which receive wide-

During this reporting period the Aerial Phenomena Group instituted a policy of unidententionally including all reports of only one witness in the insufficient data category. This is in keeping with good intelligence and scientific precepts - if substantiation cannot be found, this decreases in value the information.

This document appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing no photograph or image. As instructed, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

TIME AND RESOURCE CHARGE TO PROJECT 5771 (BLUE BOOK)

1. While no changes can be made to the program, the following is a reasonable estimate caused on a day to day basis:

Military Administrative and Scientific Civilian 6,861
15.33
Total 10,397

If we assume that this rate continues, then we have 20,798 manhours directly attributed to the UFO program during a year.

2. The other additions to overhead which are directly attributable to the UFO program, other than a few telephone calls and telegrams, are:

a. IVY funds for investigators.
b. Installation of air force equipment during investigation (cars, etc).
c. Facilities used for analysis of material reported as part of a space craft.
d. Telephone calls and Teletype.
e. Military aircraft for intercept, transport of personnel, and/or equipment.

3. Scientific consultant for the program - the annual average for consultant services has been $8,500 per year for a period of 11 years, or a total of $93,500.

4. As a supplement to the program, the Air Force had a statistical study conducted by a civilian contractor in 1952. This study cost the Air Force approximately $100,000.

The text in the document is as follows:

TIME AND RESOURCES CHARGE TO PROJECT 5771 (BLUE BOOK)

1. The following in considered to be a reasonable estimate of the charges on a day to day basis for the operation of project 5771 (Blue Book):

PERSONNEL:
a. Civilian (Administrative and Scientific) - 6,931 man hours
b. Military - 10,399 man hours

If we assume that this rate continues, when we have 20,730 manhours directly attributable to the UFO program during a year:

2. The other additions to overhead which are directly attributable to the UFO program are:

a. TAX funds for investigators.
b. Utilization of Air Force equipment during investigations (cars, etc).
c. Facilities used for analysis of material reported as part of the operation.
d. Telephones calls and TWX's.
e. Military aircraft for interception, transport of personnel, and/or equipment.

3. Scientific consultant for the program - the annual average for consultant services has been 3,500 per year for a period of 11 years, or a total of $38,500.

4. As a supplement to the program the Air Force had a statistical study conducted by a civilian contractor in 1952. This study cost the Air Force approximately $100,000.

During this reporting period the Aerial Phenomena Group instituted a policy of automatically including all reports of only one witness in the Unidentified data category. This is in keeping with good intelligence and scientific precepts - if substantiation cannot be found, this decreases the value of the information.
