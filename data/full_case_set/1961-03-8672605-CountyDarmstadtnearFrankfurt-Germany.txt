Dear Sirs! April 4, 1964

I want to report to you a flying saucer which I have seen in County Darmstadt near Frankfurt (Germany). The object seemed to me to have been in the air from the 20th March to the 25th. But perhaps it was the 20th March and the 25th. It was clear that it was the 20th March and I observed this object with my 12x50 binoculars. The surrounding area was full of wood and meadows, but on some nights she was a little in back of me. Not much time passed to wax and wane. I followed it move a couple of seconds, then it gained speed.

The image does not contain any photograph, only handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the output of the text found in the document:

and it started to move faster and faster. then it moved faster and faster until it went out of sight. the object appeared to be round, a bright light in the center, and it was moving erratically, up and down and to the side. then it arranged to a white bulky object. this happened very fast, then it moved slowly down and disappeared. a human being could never have made the object recorded. so therefore i assume it could have come from another planet or solar system which is very fantastic to believe.

The sketch includes annotations describing the movement and characteristics of the observed object, such as "Vanished?", "Speed increased", "Turned sudden", and "Woods". There is also a mention of a "Small Village Population about 10".

BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The witness while looking out the window saw a bright white object which appeared to oscillate or flutter going in a horizontal direction east to west. The object appeared to be flat and disc-shaped in form. It made no sound and disappeared from view. The witness stated the object appeared to be higher than the adjacent buildings and trees and was about the size of a car.
EVALUATION CASE CATEGORY: POSSIBLE
CONCLUSION: It appears the witness observed a natural phenomenon. The description of the object's movement and appearance are consistent with a balloon or other airborne object. No other substantive evidence is presented to indicate this was an unidentified flying object.
