I did not, for security reasons, would probably believe
any way. I did not know who to report it to.
So was one sure with you when you say the
objects. She is said (Mrs. ones) she do not they so they
36.000 feet altitude, now you how that can tell how
sprearphne know their names and addressees.

37.Was this the first time you had see an object or
objects or objects like this? (circle one);

37.1 If so, descirbe then what you saw under what
and under what circumsances did you see them.

I saw the which was above the house for about
10 minutes, it moved slowly across the sky, changing
direction slightly, then went straight up and disappeared.
Then two small onject appeared, coming from behind a
cloud, they moved erraticly and made a dipping motion
toward the moon, something I could not clearly see.
they then went behind another cloud and disappeared.
a brown reddish light did move towards the Earth for a
few seconds before going back up.

39.In your opinion, what do you think the object
was/were? Please describe in detail.

I think the object could have been a number of diffrent things. I
cannot say definitely what they were, but I know they were not
conventional aircraft, and their movement were most unusual.
sitting the moon, something seems erratic, moving towards the
earth, then back up, makes me think they were some type of
unidentified flying objects. I will admit I was quite surprised and
could not clearly make out the details, but I feel they were not convent.

29.Do you think you can estimate the speed or
the objects? (circle which) ABOUT mph would you
If you answered yes, estimate
approximately__________________.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a typed UFO analysis sheet from Project Blue Book, containing various information fields filled out about a reported UFO sighting in Springfield, Ohio on July 27, 1960.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: SPRINGFIELD, OHIO
Date (Local): 27 JULY 60
Hour (Local): 11:00
Satellite: (Det 5 ATIC, Ext 3279)
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): UNUSUAL
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-AE1): -
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc): -
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc: -
Other: -
Evaluation of Source Reliability: CONSIDERED -
Analysis and Conclusions: INFORMATION FROM THE 1960 ALMANAC SHOWS THAT THE MOON WAS ALSO VISIBLE AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. THE UNUSUAL MOTION OF THE OBJECT IS EAST TO WEST, WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE NORMAL WEST TO EAST MOTION OF THE MOON. THIS ACCOUNTS FOR ITS UNUSUAL APPEARANCE AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS MISTAKEN FOR A UFO.

The image does not contain a photograph, only handwritten text. The text appears to be a description or commentary on some occurrences, stating that "the reason the occurrences occurred at that place was due to the conditions at that place" and that "this sighting was possibly due to the degradation of a visual case". As an OCR system, I have extracted all the text from the image, which is as follows:

THE REASON THE OCCURRENCES OCCURRED AT THAT PLACE WAS DUE TO THE CONDITIONS AT THAT PLACE AND SOME OTHER FACTORS.
THIS SIGHTING WAS POSSIBLY DUE TO THE DEGRADATION OF A VISUAL CASE.

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

I acknowledge your recent letter requesting information on a UFO sighting you reported in 1961.

The object you saw was near the moon and was determined to be a "scintillation of GAMMA VIRGO's nearest star.".

Since it appears you are interested in astronomy and science, I recommend you read the new book "INTRODUCTION TO ASTRONOMY" by Dr. McLaughlin. Also, "WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS" will be of interest in the next few months.

Other information which might interest you is enclosed.

Sincerely,

Dear sir:

Last year I wrote to you concerning a U.F.O. sighting which occurred approximately one year ago on Friday, July 17, 1959. At that time I said that I would send a sketch of the object seen. However, I have not done so until now. I hope I am not too late.

The object was approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter, oval in shape and silver-white in color. It was traveling at a rapid rate of speed, and made no sound that I could hear. The sighting lasted for approximately one minute. 

I am enclosing a rough sketch of what was seen.

I hope this information is helpful. 

Yours truly,
[Redacted]
