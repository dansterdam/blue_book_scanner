Section G
15. Object still remained dark grey in color. Tail appeared to me to be made up of many threads of fire, each thread very long.
19.1 As we came to the grove of trees on the west side, was not the trail as large as at first, but we saw it three or four times after that, and seemed to be in clear sight.
19.1 I saw a body, but the trail was about twenty-two or twenty-three degrees altitude, and very clear.
20.1 As we moved further on it seemed to have been more than one point of light.
21. It was looking right at me, and it was gone in less than a wink.
25. Slightly passed over Gorcham & Main before marriage in 1929.
26.1 They appeared to be going in a similar direction as the tail or track that we first saw.
27. They were going in the same direction as the tail and watching it.
28. The trail did not seem to go up or down but remained at about the same angle.

There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. The image shows a page of handwritten text with several sections and questions.

Section A:
We were traveling west and saw the object just as we turned a corner. It got gradually larger and nearer as it passed overhead (blueish green) slightly turning as it passed over - quite fast. It vanished rather suddenly in the distance.

Section B:
1.1 - Do not drink any smokeless gas which the object appeared to be emitting, as this could possibly be dangerous to your health.
1.2 We observed on the edges of the object that it appeared to be slightly spinning or rotating, and seemed to have a metallic appearance. 
1.3 It emitted a bright light. (Can't remember if it was green or orange.)

This page does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a report from Project Blue Book, discussing an incident that occurred on September 26, 1952 in the Azores Islands.

UNCLASSIFIED

26 September 1952
Azores Islands

Description of Incident:
At approximately 0116Z (2316 local time), a C-121 enroute from Harmon AFB, Newfoundland to the Azores observed two distinct green lights 15-20 degrees off the right wing and slightly below the aircraft. The lights were observed for approximately 8 minutes and were reported to the pilot of the aircraft. The lights were described as very bright, stationary, triangular in shape, and estimated to be alternately leading each other. The lights were visible until the aircraft sighted the Azores.
All other known aircraft in the area were checked with the tower and established that they were too far away to be seen. Surface vessels were also checked but more were in the area.
The weather was CAVU.

Comments:
The only possibility considered is another light phenomenon similar to the so-called "green fireballs" that have been reported over various areas, including the Azores. In addition, all aircraft flying in that area keep their position known to the Air Force, so they can be added in an emergency. The only other possible explanation would be unfriendly and again this is doubtful.

The light phenomenon is possible since the light wing carries an man light, and the description is similar to several proposed phenomena. However, the exact nature of this proposed phenomenon has not been determined and can only be attributed to this.

Conclusion:
Unknown

Transcription of the text:

A. A certain world a/s - military airplanes were seen. The type of planes was not identified. No unusual behavior was noted.

7. An explosion cso, Chicago, 11 May 1955. The explosion occurred at 11:00 PM CST and was apparently due to a meteorite or other space object breaking up on reentry into the atmosphere. The noise was heard for many miles around and the incident was well covered in the press.

8. Unusual radar contacts on 25 February 1956. Air Force radar stations in the Gulf of Mexico detected several unidentified targets traveling at extremely high speeds. No visual sightings were made. Analysis indicated the targets were natural phenomena, possibly meteor fragments.

9. Correspondence in the files, 25 June 1958. Several letters and reports were received from commercial airline pilots regarding unusual lights and objects observed during flights. No definite conclusions were reached.

10. There is no case data on the page from reports on 10 March 1952.

11. Foreign pilots have reported seeing strange objects in the sky during flights since 1961.

12. There is no case data on the page from reports on 18 April 1952.

13. 22 September 1973 incident when various government agencies received reports of unidentified objects over Washington DC and surrounding areas. Extensive investigations were conducted but no definitive conclusions were reached.
