The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from the Department of the Air Force, specifically a report from Captain K. Edward J. Grenic, a UFO investigating officer, regarding a sighting that occurred on April 5, 1967 in the vicinity of the Peoria Air National Guard near Canton, Illinois. The report provides details about the sighting and indicates that the investigation is ongoing.

Text extracted from the document:

AF IN : 46289

K. EDWARD J. GRENIC, CAPTAIN, USAF, UFO INVESTIGATING OFFICER, RECEIVED THIS REPORT ON THE 3RD OF APRIL 1967, 10 DAYS AFTER THE SIGHTING OCCURRED. CAPT KIER WITH THE PEORIA AIR NAT'L GUARD IS CONDUCTING A RECORDS CHECK OF AIR OPERATIONS IN THE VICINITY OF THE SIGHTING AREA. THIS REPORT SHOULD BE RECEIVED BY THE 6TH OF APRIL 1967. AS OF NOW, NO FIRM DETERMINATION CAN BE MADE, SINCE THE SALE'S RESIDENCE LIES ON THE AIRWAY, AND SINCE THE PEORIA VOR APPROACH PROCEDURE TURN WOULD BE OVER THIS AREA AT AN ALTITUDE OF 1200 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, I STRONGLY SUSPECT THIS TO BE AN AIRCRAFT. THE LOW CEILING AND VISIBILITY WOULD CAUSE REFLECTED LIGHT TO BE MISINTERPRETED. THE INVESTIGATION WILL CONTINUE, AND THE CONTENTS OF THE REPORT FROM CAPT KIER WILL BE FORWARDED.

OCR Text Output:

This is in regards to the sightened UFO mystery that has occurred over the Lake Canton area. According to the official reports, an object of a definite controlled nature was seen in the sky and described in detail as "round and very bright". Colored lights were observed as the object made angular and horizontal maneuvers. Many eye witness reports have been obtained from local residents who observed the object flying over the lake at a low altitude.

Our small boat was on the shores of Lake Canton about three quarters of a mile from the city when this sighting occurred. The object was in full view without obstruction. On several occasions it hovered motionless for them seemingly at a distance, or perhaps a few hundred yards away. As it departed it accelerated rapidly and in full view without obstruction. We observe it for nearly twenty minutes. Many times we were uncertain whether the object was hovering or moving, but a few have been observed rapid and fantastic maneuvers. 

Much time has been devoted to the subject, and it is my opinion that the reports we have received are substantiated by scientific and eye witness reports. Calling this phenomenon is of no value, as you have no doubt realized that many such comments merit us useless. We feel this report may be submitted as useful material toward the unravelling of the UFO mystery.

Yesterday evening March 25, 1957 at approximately 6:25 PM, my wife and I observed a brilliant object hovering over the southern hills around Lake Canton. The object seemed to be several hundred yards from the shore, surrounded by a gentle breeze, trying only to make no noise as it hovered with an eerie stillness. It did not seem high in the sky, but more at the level of the trees. After observing the object for a short time, it suddenly accelerated at a fantastic speed, raising vertically, leaving a trail of smoke or steam. It was so fast that we didn't have time to look up as the object passed. We were standing on the shore facing the lake, and the object was hovering in the sky above the lake, moving off toward the eastern shore. By the time we turned our heads, the object was gone. The acceleration was so fast it seemed to vanish. The object appeared to be about the size of a basketball, round and brilliant white in color, surrounded by a hazy glow. It created no sound that we could hear. When it accelerated, it left no trail behind it, but only a faint trail of smoke or steam. In my opinion, it was a genuine UFO of a technologically advanced design, unlike any aerial vehicle I am familiar with.

Transcribed text:

Regarding this was the time when an official report, I took the house to go over it. I had observed. One of the girls, who was here very within, frightened and hardly a similar to describing to see this. So I gather to take a look although I told her about this, she said she'd be so. I asked a blurb red twice, so that he who was who I said had to be at 11 o'clock. This is the reception which was later recorded and seen us when we returned from the light, which was the size of a small plane and also had close to the lights, (at the time David was a gape. Something had happened)

Later as Amatins said (that) observer, I have a very clear again about what happened here. About 1:30 A.M. it came closer to the house and they flashed a bright into some nearby trees. But they just quickly missed them. They did not seem to our house. They just asked if they were not bright. It was lighted. I said there would have a sound distinct before, when it began to take somewhere else. "
Soon said when the object sped away it traveled toward the north-east. As it moved, it seemed to disappear into a course toward the north-northeast, covering the distance in very short time. No more than 200 feet.

I asked what unusual feelings had he when he observed this. He said, nothing unusual except this he was strongly impressed that this was intently, but he could not explain it. The intensity of the light burning was almost intolerable. It was so bright, it was difficult t looking at it. To the strong attraction it had on him, it was an oxobat.

Respectfully, Edward T. Jo
