10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING             O Possibly Astronomical
Three (3) white objects, still in sight at the O Possibly Meteorological
time of the preliminary report, appeared the O Other…
size of a star. The objects were seen for a     O Insufficient Data for Evaluation 
period of thirty minutes at the time of the
report. The observer had four witnesses.

COMMENTS
The fact that the observer had four 
witnesses would tend to eliminate the
possibility of optical phenomena. The
description of the sighting could possibly
be the that of a balloon cluster,
reflecting the lights of the city.
Sandpoint NAS releases many balloons,
with winds permitting, drift over 
Seattle.
