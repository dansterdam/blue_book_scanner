SUBJ: UFO OBSERVATIONS, 22 June 1968
Lt. Colonel called me regards to his aerial advertising plane.
Mr. was flying in the area of Miamisburg, Franklin, West Carrollton 
and Kettering on the night of 22 June 1968 and was over Franklin at approximately 
10:30 PM on 22 June 1968. His plane was visible for approximately 15 miles
distance. He was advertising for Steueve Ford of Miamisburg for their sentinel.
He said that his plane was in the area for the Mt. Healthy sighting
that we had written about. He didn't know if his plane was in the area 
for the other sighting since he didn't know the exact location of it. We
told him it was about 20 miles up river from Cincinnati. He said that his
plane is visible for approximately fifteen miles in the distance and that
he had been operating as far east of Cincinnati as Mt Washington. Lt Marano
said that we would write him a short note listing some of the towns in the
area of the sighting.

Dr. Academic Director, AFIT, Ext 54808 observed an UFO on the night of 22 June 1968 at approximately 0200 hrs while driving to Cincinnati. 
Just before the Turnoff at Middletown he sighted an object between two and three foot high. The object was lighted and appeared to be 6 - 8 ft thick, due shaped, 60 - 75 ft long, well lighted, not brilliant. Seemed to be rotating clockwise at a fast pace. The pattern was repetitious, as he watched the object for twenty minutes. Object was heading west. Another thing it seemed to be rotating counter clockwise. He quit watching the object while it was over Franklin. Felt the approximate speed was 60 - 80 mph.
