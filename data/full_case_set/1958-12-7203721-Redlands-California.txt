The image contains a grainy, black-and-white photograph that appears to show a UFO or unidentified aerial object. The object is difficult to make out clearly, but it appears to be a dark, elongated shape against a blurry background. There is text in the top left corner of the image that reads "13 DEC 1956 REDLANDS, CALIFORNIA".

The image appears to be a photograph showing an outdoor scene with various vehicles and structures. The image does not contain any human faces, so I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals. The photograph shows a commercial area with a building labeled "Marketeer" and several trucks or vans parked in the foreground. The background includes additional structures and buildings.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Report of Unidentified Flying Object
Redlands, California - 7 December 1958

1. On 7 December 1958, at approximately 1830 hours, a bright, round, orange-colored object was observed by Mr. and Mrs. Walter Sanders, 1231 East Citrus Avenue, Redlands, California. The object was first seen to the south of their location, moving in a north-easterly direction at a very rapid rate of speed. Mr. Sanders estimated the object's speed to be from 1500 to 2000 mph.

2. As the object neared their location, it slowed down and made a slight descent, stopping directly over their home. The object hovered for approximately 10-15 minutes, during which time it changed color from orange to bluish-white.

3. During the hovering period, the object appeared to be about 30-40 feet in diameter. No sound was heard and no exhaust trails were visible. After the hovering period, the object accelerated rapidly and disappeared to the northeast.

4. This incident was also reported by other residents of Redlands and the surrounding area. No other details are available.

5 February 1959

Dear Mr. _____,

Your report of an unidentified flying object and a negative received by the Air Technical Intelligence Center on 23 January 1959.

The negative and receipt are returned herewith.

The report contained insufficient data to arrive at a valid evaluation. It also contained a serious contradiction which precludes definitive analysis and/or evaluation of this sighting.

You state in the report that you did not see the object until the film had been developed. The exposure for this film was only one-fifteenth of a second, yet you say the object was visible. This difference in time interval renders this sighting valueless.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Scientific Officer
Foreign Technology Division
