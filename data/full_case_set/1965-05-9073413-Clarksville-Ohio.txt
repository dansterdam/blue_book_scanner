The article discusses experts identifying UFOs as man-made satellites based on observations made on a Sunday night. There does not appear to be any photograph included in this image.

Here is the text from the newspaper clipping as an OCR output:

THIS MORNING'S BRIEFS
EXPERTS IDENTIFY UFOS AS MAN-MADE SATELLITES
PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY HAVE BEEN SEEING UFOS (UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS) IN THE SKY HAVE BEEN SEEING SATELLITES IN MOST CASES, EXPERTS SAID YESTERDAY.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE MUTUAL UFO NETWORK INC., SAID HIS GROUP HAS IDENTIFIED THE UFOS AS THESE MAN-MADE SATELLITES. SPOKESMEN AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE SAID YESTERDAY THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED OF SEVERAL CASES WHERE UFOS ARE NOTHING MORE THAN ORBITING SATELLITES.
