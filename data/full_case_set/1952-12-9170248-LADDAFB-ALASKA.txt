Characteristics. The color of the light seemed to change from white to red as if the atmosphere had an effect on it as it gained altitude. Object unidentifiable due to darkness of night, speed of object, and position of observer. Object not audible. When on ground, nothing of a motor, engine, or other propulsion nature was noticed. Temperature approximately -20° and noise could be (have been) heard at very long distances with no wind at that temperature. Upon landing, (Pilot after F-94 landed) the object moved in an erratic flight path for a period of three minutes until it was pointed out again to the pilot and a ground crew members.(????) Then it took up a heading of 160° gaining speed until it looked like a falling star or meteor. Descending all the time, it continued to become a brighter red as it reached the earth. The light appeared to diminish its forward speed and descent to the earth as a helicopter would. At this point the light was noticeably more red than before. Time: 0996:16z to 0996:26z. Weather conditions: Night, VFR CAVU.

REPORT OF SIGHTINGS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (FLYERT-1)

Date: The object was observed on 12 May Lt. Thomas Davis, Major, USAF, Pilot, Lt. DAVID H BROWN, USAF, Navigator.
Mission: Personnel on instrument training flight. Both are regarded as reliable observers.

(f) The weather was CAVU with variable winds.
(g) There is no activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, known that could account for the sighting. It is believed this case is authentic and a sincere attempt was made to determine any possibilities along this line, and suggestions for further investigation will be forwarded in a separate report.

(h) No physical evidence has been developed in connection with this sighting.
(i) No interception or identification action was taken due to a recent or this aircraft during the time.
(j) After landing, the Radar Observer and the Pilot watched the object continue on a south-westerly direction, gradually fading from view. The Davis and Brown both stated the object was definite and real and described it as elliptical in shape, reddish in color, and larger than the control tower building. It was given a negative report in both instances.

2. Ladd Air Force Base, Alaska, 147° 52' - 64° 49' N.
3. Unidentified airborne object (light) heading approximately 205° true at 2,000 feet altitude. On straight course for approximately one (1) minute then it started increasing its speed noticeably. Altitude 2,000 feet. Speed increased up to approximately 600 knots, travel 4½ miles in approximately two (2) minutes. Object white in color, oval in shape. Altitude 2,000 feet. Continued on 240° heading at 2,900 feet for approximately two (2) minutes. No jet or rocket stream noticed.
4. Normal number 55-2282, F-94A, Znd-Jett, F-94A.
One engine, 23,000 feet altitude, speed 600 knots per hour. Sighting, certain number 19-2522.
5. Not applicable.
Dictamen: Aircraft serial number 49-2522, F-94A. It is Donald A. Davies, Lt. Col. USAF, radar observer. Was on base leg to approach for landing when at last 18 Davies called attention to pilot on unknown object at 18,000 of 20,000 contact altitude, object moving from northeast to southwest to port. Target confirmed by pilot. The F-94A was heading 060°, target was heading 205° true, difference approximate 120°. When F-94A, serial number 29-2522, turned on base leg, heading approximately 220°, the object continued on heading approximately 205° same altitude. From position or base area target is passed to ascend at a reasonable rate with a probable control very soon at target characteristics. The object descend to light cloud cover, then reappeared same position at same altitude. The conclusion be able to affect on target was unlikely, at extreme altitude. Object unidentified speed with a maximum of 600 knots and position of observer. Object not audible. When on ground, nothing or a motor sound or engine could be heard as a very long distance with light to moderate visible haze. Upon landing (2) minutes after observation, pilot stated (2) ground crew members said it was pointed out again to the pilot and two (2) ground crew members. Then it broke up at 18,000 and speed until it looked like a falling star or meteor. Depending on the time, it continues to become clear until it is concluded it was a meteor with more luminescence and speed than normal. This would indicate the light was probably more red than before. Time 2050-2052.

1. Reference is made to TMX, date-time 1106452, this headquarters Project 10073, 16 November 1952.

2. The following information, submitted in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding dated 26 April 1952, is presented as a summary of the information contained herein.

On 9 December 1952 an unidentified object sighted consisted of a white light, oval in shape. Size could not be determined, except that it appeared to be of considerable magnitude. It moved at a very high rate of speed and appeared to be at an extremely high altitude. No sound or means of propulsion was visible. The object was observed for approximately 1-1/2 to 2 minutes.

(a) Exact time of sighting: 11/4/1972. No positive clock can be made on duration of observation, but observers estimate four to ten seconds.

(b) Observation was visual only, from the air. The object was seen to fly over a mountainous area for approximately 1-1/2 to 2 minutes.

(c) Observation was made at an approximate elevation of 14,000 feet, while aircraft was at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet.

(d) Due to the high rate of speed and high altitude, no other details could be determined.

Objects (UFO RPT)

From the aircraft was not known, definite attitude cannot be ascertained, however, initial sighting on the object definitely apparent at 0745A MST. The object was ovoid in shape, emitting a bright bluish-white light on the end. At the time of the observation, the aircraft was a heading of approximately 290 degrees, the object traveling in a southwesterly direction.

The Captain of the Alaskan Air Lines, coming from the opposite direction, also sighted the object, having flown in this territory for over six to seven years, and are considered to be very reliable observers. The object was observed for several minutes, varying in size, color, and shape. During the interview, detailed sightings of several years-ago sightings, made by the pilots were discussed. The Captain who was sitting in the aisle of the aircraft was amazed at the size of the object, and the pilots and co-pilots hands shaking as they watched the object.

(A) Anything else regarding that sighting could not be determined.

(B) At the present time, no conditions, such as meteorological or astronomical, could be ascertained for this information, and if an affirmative answer is found, this information will be forwarded in a separate supplement.

(C) No physical evidence is available.

(D) No interception or identification action was taken, either by the aircraft or by any other units, inasmuch as this sighting did not indicate the aircraft or the object were in danger.

(E) Pilot called Ladd Tower immediately after the sighting and reported information regarding only other aircraft in the vicinity. The information received from Ladd Tower was given a negative response.

SUBJECT: Interrogation of Unidentified Flying Objects   11 December 1952

The following is a transcript of an interrogation made 11 December 1952, at the Northwest Tactical Air Command, Lt Col William Brown, Intelligence Officer, interrogating. Also present were Lt. Colonel C. G. Gilman, Chief of Staff Operations and Training; Major John Anstrom, Wing Intelligence Officer; Captain William J. Henderson, Interrogating Officer.
(Witness: Air Lines.)  (Pilot of a Commercial Air Lines was also present.)

Q. Where were you when this happened?
A. We were half way between Pasco and Ellensburg, Washington, travelling in a North Easterly direction across the mountains. About one minute before this sighting.

Q. How long was this visible?
A. Pilot said for about three or four seconds; I think is was off for it to look up at the pilot's watch and see the elapsed time.

Q. That direction was it going in?
A. It was going in a straight horizontal line toward the left wing.

Q. What color was this?
A. It was a blue, greenish, white.

Q. Was there any chase to it other than the lights?
A. No, we could just see the lights out the sight.

Q. What time did this thing place?
A. It was just about 6:10 or 6:15.

Q. How far away did it appear?
A. We couldn't say for sure - there was nothing to compare it to. The crew said it seemed to be fairly close, but it could not better describe the distance.

Due to Air Lines. I am sorry but I am not able to give any more detailed information about a year and half ago near northwest. The radio called us in and received a report to investigate if we had seen anything. At first I thought the reports were a mistake as it was my first sighting of such an object, but I can verify the facts given and I will say that the object did not resemble any conventional airplane, helicopter or other known type of aerial vehicle that I have ever seen. It was very high speed and the color and its operation was quite different from a normal aircraft. Shortly after reporting the incident and during the ground investigation, we were advised not to discuss the details of the incident with anyone other than the investigating officers.

very horizontal path from Northward toward Galena,.
The only one big object with bright linesas fair as distance?
Q. I think that it was going like hell.
Q. It didn't give you any feeling of how far or how close?
A. It would give me about thirty-five seconds but I didn't tell how far or how close it was so well as I should be able to tell, because I was concentrating on bigger than any light that we could pick out. I t look'd like a landing light.
Q. Yes, it seems to be a brightcrthan any star.
A. Yes, and bigger. It really amazed me because it seem'danever saw anything like that before. And that's why I was watching it so closely.
Q. Wwas it like the Air 2 craft? The one that t saw fus was orange from the tail.
A. I don't give you any questions about reporting these things. 
Because I have already told you about this and we thought it 12 will come a report of confirmation.
Q. Do you have anything more to say about observations, how long it lasted, estimate of size, apparent speed, maneuvering characteristics, color, or any other details? 
A. I didn't see anything else except that it was flying and that's all I can tell you. I can't give you anything more than that.
(CIVILIAN WITNESS) I saw one at Elmendorf a couple of year ago over the air base. It was a big orange like a big star with little windows in it. It was about fifteen hundred feet high and moving at a terrific rate of speed. It would be in sight maybe thirty or forty seconds and then gone. I couldn't tell you anything more about it.
Q. What was your first impression of this one when you saw it the other night?
A. We thought it might be a missile, but there were no trails behind it.
Q. Do you have any other details or thoughts you can give us about this sighting?
A. I've all been flying up here about five or six years and we have never seen anything like this before as I have mentioned.

PROBLEM: To obtain additional information on the reporting of contraril sightings in Greenland 10 and 12 December 1952.

FACTS AND DISCUSSION:

1. Received message AFIN 27501 which was garbled, AFIN 27525 dtd 10 Dec 52 was corrected copy. These were followed by AFIN 27571 confirming cable (from Quartermaster A73 Greenland).

3. Received AFIN 28916 dated 12 Dec 52 (from Harrarassauk AD Greenland).

4. Cables received 10 Dec indicated contraril heading of 360° which would indicate aircraft sighting progressing towards the U.S.

5. Cable received 12 Dec contained insufficient information to make a conclusive evaluation. However it was stated Canadian aircraft could have been involved. The time group stated in this cable are correct. Navy Air Greenland to investigate if it could have been one of their aircraft.

6. The Commanding FEAF obtained information that three P-86s landed at Harrarassauk at 1450 Zulu, 12 Dec on a classified mission. There is a possibility that this aircraft could have been responsible for the reported contraril due to a discrepancy in the reported time.

7. That between 1200 and 1300 Zulu, 12 Dec, the visibility was 15 miles and the ceilings and from 1300 to 1800 Zulu 16/10ths stratus cumulus. While it is possible that contraril could have been seen below the over-cast by these ground observers, it is certain that the aircraft could not have been more than 15 miles away and possibly much closer. Further this contraril could not have been observed except by visual observers that it is questionable.

8. The provisions of paragraph 203 of JANAP 146 B were only partially complied with in Cable 27571 from Sonderstrom AFB. Cable 29916 from Harrarassauk does not fall into a CIRVIS category since it was not observed from the air. The information required in the case of CIRVIS incidents should have been reported.

10. Cable 28916 from Harrarassauk indicates that the cable was processed and dispatch at 1300 Zulu reporting the condition of contraril sighting. This would not allow the 1400 Zulu time reported for preparation and time of sighting indicates either a cable or typographical error either in time or date. The fact that both preparation and time of sighting are within 1 hour of the dispatch time indicates a questionable validity within the report.

1. Object sited was a light, comparafle Ln size, intensity and color to a large star. Its duration was dynamic In size or shall or multiple or irregular variation was only a few seconds, no approximation can be made since the duration of the light drawn the observation cannot be accurately established.

2. Time of sighting was from 17/0555Z to 17/0615Z (local time 1555 hrs. to 1615 hrs. on the 17th of Dec.) with intermittent disappearance.

3. Observation was visual from the ground, no optical or electronic equipment was used.

4. See attached map with legend for approximate movement of light should be fairly accurate, however, since distances to not shown it is not known if the observed directions of light are correct.

5. The following is the 1947 74th Air Rescue Sqdn. (on outside guard duty at 74th Air Rescue Sqdn.) was the first to observe the light. He states that he has seen it on this theater 5 months and its characteristics varied. He states at times it appears to be several objects maneuvering close together and at other times it appears as one object. The appearance and disappearance is irregular and rate reliability.

A/1c RICHARD J. ROACH, 74th Air Rescue Sqdn (on inside guard duty) was shown it by 1st Lt. OAKLEY and Cpl. WALLEY. He states that it was a bright light moving at high speed, and that he has had previous experience with unidentified flying objects and no evaluation can be made as to its reporting reliability.

1st Lt. DERHY P. OAKLEY, 74th Air Rescue Sqdn. (on duty as duty controller) was shown it by the above enlisted men and observed it for almost an hour. Since Lt. OAKLEY has been in this theater 22 months and from his experience in flying he should be a qualified person to report such observations. However, since he observed the object only a short duration he does not have too much to report.

1. Position of observers throughout observation.

2. General direction (line of sight) in which light was observed to move. Light was observed to move from East to West.

3. Point at which observer estimated light to be at time of original observation. At this time it had a definite up and down motion. He ascertained this by its position over a nearby telephone pole.

4. Broken and line (- - - -) denotes approximate course and distance as estimated by observers.

5. Red line denotes general direction (line of sight) at which A/C T LIGHT was joined by A/C KOACH in observation at approximately 2000 hrs. A/C states object traveled very swiftly (faster than jet) when first sighted from point (3) and then slowed down to a barely perceptible movement before arriving at the intersection of lines (4) and (5). At this point the light blinked off momentarily and KOACH (who was just inside the bldg.) was requested to come out and observe. Light continued in same general direction and very slowly with a discernable descent to line (6) at which time it again momentarily blinked out. At this time Lt. OAKLY (also in the hangar) was requested to come outside and observe. This was at approximately 2003 hrs.

Target was heading from .star-board to port. (Note: Probably means right to left when looking out port side of a/c.) Targets affirmed by pilot. The F-94 was heading 60°. Target was heading 240° approximately parallel and 130° to fighter flight. During the next 30 to 45 seconds target increased its speed noticeably. When F-94, Serial No. 49-2522 turned in base log (Note: Probably means final approach) heading approximately 240°, target continued heading approximately 240° at the same altitude.
