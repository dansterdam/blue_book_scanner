PAGE TWO
THE OBJ. APPEARED TO REMAIN IN THE SAME GEN AREA AND THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF CONTRACTION OR CHANGE IN SHAPE. IT SEEMS TO US THAT THE OBJECT WAS UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL. AS TO THE MOTION THERE WAS PRACTICALLY NO SOUND CONNECTED WITH IT THAT WAS HEARD BY THE WITNESSES. IT COULD BE MORE PROPERLY DESCRIBED AS FLOATING OR HOVERING EXCEPT FOR THE TIME WHEN IT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND MOVED OUT OF SIGHT. THE OBJ. DID NOT APPEAR TO BE EXHAUST DRIVEN SINCE IT WAS OF THE SILENT TYPE. THE OBEJECTS APPEARANCE AND BEHAVIOUR AS DESCRIBED BY THE WITNESSES WAS VERY UNUSUAL, QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF ORDINARY AIRCRAFT. THEY COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED AS A KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT.

PAGE THREE
IF A LARGE GROUP STANDING ON HIGH GROUND COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE THING AT CLOSE RANGE AND VISIALLY FOLLOW IT AND MARK ITS FLIGHT PEW FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, IT MAKES IT QUITE POSITVE THAT IT WAS A REAL OBJECT AND NOT SOME SORT OF OPTICAL ILLUSION. SHORTLY AFTER FLIGHT WHICH LASTED FROM 2 TO 3 MINUTES THE OBJ. DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. THE WITNESSES WERE RELIABLE PERSONS, SOME BEING AIRPORT PERSONNEL AND COULD NOT BE CONSIDERING AS BEING PRONE TO IMAGINATION OR EXAGGERATION. CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR DESCRIPTION AND SIGHTINGS OF THIS OBJ. MUST BE ACCORDED CONSIDERABLE CREDENCE.

Transcribed text from the document:

THE OBJECT APPEARED TO REMAIN IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA WITH A SUDDEN SHOOTING OFF AT TIMES TO OTHER AREAS CLOSE BY THIS WAS SO INDICATIVE OF CONTROL THAT IT SEEMS APPARENT THAT IT WAS UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL. IT APPEARED AT TIMES TO STOP SUDDENLY AND HOVER AT VARIOUS SPOTS. ITS CHANGE OF DIRECTION AND SPEED WERE VERY RADICAL AND IT APPEARED TO CHANGE DIRECTION SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT PREPARATION. THERE WAS NO EXHAUST OR TRAIL AND IT LEFT OR APPROACHED FROM ANY DIRECTION. IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A STAR. PLANET OR ANY KNOWN CELESTIAL BODY. COULD NOT HAVE BEEN EXHAUST FUMES OR SUCH AS THIS WAS NOT INDICATED BY THIS OBSERVATION. LIKE OTHER SIMILAR OBSERVATIONS, THIS OBSERVATION COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED OR CORRELATED WITH ANY KNOWN CELESTIAL OR TERRESTRIAL OBJECT.

PAGE THREE
SHORTLY AFTER SIGHTING CALL WAS MADE TO SHERIFF'S OFFICE BUT THERE WAS SOME DELAY IN DISPATCHING PERSONNEL TO THE AREA OF SIGHTING. BY THE TIME THEY ARRIVED THE OBJECT HAD DISAPPEARED. WITNESSES STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 40-50 FEET IN DIAMETER AND APPEARED TO BE SOLID AND BRIGHT IN APPEARANCE WITH A REDDISH GLOW. IT SEEMED TO HOVER AT TIMES AND AT OTHER TIMES TO DART AROUND THE SKY IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS. THE OBJECT WAS IN SIGHT FOR APPROXIMATELY 5-10 MINUTES AND THEN DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.
