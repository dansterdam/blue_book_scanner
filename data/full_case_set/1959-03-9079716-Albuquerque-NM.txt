ASTRONOMY

Venus Becomes Prominent

Mercury is also visible for a few days near March 12.
When the most favorable evening elongation for 1959 occurs, Venus will be in the wst after sunset and will be an eveing star. This will occur on March 12.

By JAMES STOKLEV

Spring is bringing animals to the northward, with birds migrating and flowers blooming, and soon the evening skies will be graced by the presence of Venus, which will be quite prominent for some time.

After the planets Mercury and Jupiter disappear from view, Venus will appear low in the west just after sunset, and it will be visible as a brilliant evening star. This will occur by around March 12, and the period of time when Venus will be prominent in the evening sky will last until early July.

Following the same course as the sun in the sky, Venus will travel northward day by day, and at the same time it will increase in brightness. In fact, by the time Venus reaches a position high in the sky, it will be much brighter than any other planet or any star, and there will be no mistaking its identity.

This year, as Venus reaches its maximum brightness, it will still be higher in the sky than most of the other planets. This position is known as the evening apparition of Venus, and it is the brightest and most prominent of all the planet apparitions.

The planet Venus, of course, has a very regular course in the sky, and its movements can be predicted with great accuracy. The brightest object in the sky after the sun and moon, Venus can easily be seen with the naked eye and is always an evening or morning star. Right now Venus is an evening star, and it will continue to grow brighter and move higher in the sky until early summer.

Following the course of the earth around the sun, Venus swings in a nearly circular orbit, and as a result it goes through phases similar to the moon, from a full disk to a thin crescent. However, as its position changes relative to the earth, the illuminated portion of the planet that we see becomes larger or smaller.

SAUCER NEWS LETTER for FEBRUARY 21, 1959

DIES FORETLDS

ATOMIC BEAM PERFORMS BRAIN SURGERY ON RUSSIAN 

A Russian, age 28, was subjected to a new type of "brain surgery" by means of an atomic beam, according to a recent news report published In Italy. The patient was a young man of 34, suffering from a mental disturbance and exhibiting symptoms of a dangerous or criminal psychosis. After a pre-operative physical and psychological examination, the patient was given local anesthesia and an operation begun. Instead of the usual incision, a beam or ray was directed at certain areas of the brain. The operation took about two hours. The patient remained conscious throughout the procedure and reported no pain. He was discharged from the hospital after 10 days, completely cured of his mental disturbance. The operation apparently left no scar or external evidence. Some Russian scientists claim to have achieved this method of "bloodless brain surgery" through the use of atomic or nuclear beams, but little is known about it in the West. It ts not known whether or how this process would be applicable to the treatment of mental diseases in the United States.

FORCES EARLY DIAGNOSIS FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

T. EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS:

The National Multiple Sclerosis Society, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, has
 pointed out that much valuable time is being lost in the diagnosis and treatment of this serious disease. Often the signs and symptoms of this disease are dismissed or misinterpreted in the early stages, resulting in delay of proper treatment. Some indications of the early stage of MS are fatigue, numbness, tingling, weakness or incoordination to one side of the body, loss of control of the bowel or bladder, and blurred or double vision. These symptoms may recur and disappear, only to reappear later. The Society believes that prompt recognition of these early signs and symptoms can lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment. If the disease is detected in its early stages, the patient has a much better chance of arresting or controlling the progress of the disease.

INSECT JUVENILE HORMONE FOUND TO DETERMINE SEXES

THE "JUVENILE HORMONE" that holds males and females in life-stage balance was used to prove that it determines the sex of certain insects. Dr. Carroll M. Williams of Harvard University said that when the hormone is "stolen" from immature insects, their sex can be reversed. This discovery may have far-reaching implications in the study and control of insects. The hormone, essential for most insects as they grow, is present in larvae and pupae but declines in adult life. Its withdrawal from young insects has been found to affect the sexual development of many species. The research indicates that the juvenile hormone is a key factor in determining whether an insect will develop into a male or female.

CARTOON SHOWS CARTER SNAKE CAN HARBOR SLEEPING SICKNESS VIRUS

A recent cartoon in the New England Journal of Medicine depicts a Carter snake coiled around a stick, with the comment that Carter snakes can harbor the sleeping sickness virus. The snake is shown to be the vector or carrier of the virus, which can be transmitted to man. Carter snakes have been found infected with the virus in some parts of the United States. The sleeping sickness, or encephalitis, can be a serious disease and the cartoon serves to warn the public about the dangers from these snakes in certain areas.

WASHINGTON, MARCH 17--(UP)--THE NAVY SAID TODAY THAT A WEATHER BALLOON, NOT A FLYING SAUCER, WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A REPORTED SIGHTING OVER THE UNITED STATES. COMMANDER JOHN M. FORD, OF THE NAVY'S OFFICE OF PUBLIC INFORMATION, SAID THE NAVY'S TRACKING PROGRAM HAS REVEALED MANY SUPPOSEDLY MYSTERIOUS AERIAL OBJECTS TO BE WEATHER BALLOONS.

THE AUTOMATIC TIMING DEVICE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE CAUSED THE BALLOON'S COURSE AND SPEED TO CHANGE, WHICH WOULD HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE SIGHTING. BECAUSE OF THIS, THE TIMING DEVICE DID NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY.

IT WAS NOT EXPECTED TO SOAR BEYOND THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, IT DRIFTED INTO THE UPPER AIR STREAMS AND WAS GOING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE FLIGHT WAS PLANNED TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF A NEW TYPE PLASTIC BALLOON CAPABLE OF TRANSMITTING PRESSURE, ALTITUDE AND POSITION DATA UNTIL RADIO CONTACT WAS LOST.

Balloon released from Stanton, Minn. at 1220 A.M. EST Friday, 13 March 1959. It was not expected to soar beyond the United States. However, it drifted into the upper air streams and was going at a high rate of speed, more than 100 miles an hour at a height of 34,000 feet. The flight was designed to test the feasibility of a new type of plastic balloon equipped with instruments to transmit pressure, altitude and position data until radio contact was lost.

REPORT RECORD: 1959-03-9079716 
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT OVER ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO
On the evening of 8 March 1959 at approximately 1949 hours, a very bright light was observed moving in a northwesterly direction over the Albuquerque, New Mexico, area. The object was observed by numerous persons and its course and speed were verified by the control tower at Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico.
The object was observed as a rapidly moving, extremely bright light which appeared to be traveling faster than any known aircraft. The object left no vapor trail or sound as it moved at great speed. It was observed by Albuquerque police and Air Force personnel, and its course and speed verified by the control tower at Kirtland AFB. The object was visible for approximately 2 minutes before it disappeared from view over the northwest horizon.
Military and civilian observers were unable to identify the object as any known type of aircraft or other aerial vehicle. Project BLUE BOOK has classified this incident as "UNIDENTIFIED".

Transcription of text from the image:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. If the object remained at a constant altitude, place an "A" and "B" at the same point.

28. Draw a picture there will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" or "C" any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
