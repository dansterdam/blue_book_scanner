NUMEROUS BALLONS AT 0902Z BY SPRINGFIELD, PEORIA, ST LOUIS, TERRE
HAUTE, DAYTON, AND OTHER WEATHER AGENCIES IN THE AREA OF LOUISVILLE.
A STRONG POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT THE SIGHTING COULD HAVE BEEN A
WEATHER BALLOON RELEASED FROM A STATION WEST OF LOUISVILLE. THIS, IN
CONJUNCTION WITH A WESTERLY FLOW OF AIR ACROSS THE SECTOR COULD HAVE
POSITIONED A BALLOON IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF LOUISVILLE AT THE TIME
OF THE SIGHTING. CHADS WEATHER STATION CONFIRMED A WESTERLY FLOW UP
WIND AT AN ALTITUDE BELOW 32,333 FT. LE NONE. M. PILOT 
STATED THE OBJECT MIGHT BE AN OBJECT IN SPACE.
