Transcribed text from the document:

"New 'What's It?' Crosses Our Sky
Greater Cincinnati was said last night to have passed under a strange phenomenon in the skies, described as a "What's It?" which crossed over the area about 7 p.m.
A phone was received last night by a night telephone operator here who reported the object moving across the sky. She said it was definitely not a plane or satellite. Other persons also reported seeing the strange object.
Unless the sighting was something commonplace, this is the second report of a strange sky object in the Greater Cincinnati area within the past few days. On Sunday night, a saucer-shaped object was reported by several persons to have been spotted in the sky over Hamilton, Ohio." 

This text appears to be a news article or report describing a sighting of an unidentified flying object or "What's It?" over the Greater Cincinnati area on the evening of November 17, 1960.
