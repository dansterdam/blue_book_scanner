Dear Sir:

This is a belated UFO report. I was always curious whether sightings on this similar. It could indicate if your files would be worth while to pass it on anyway, even at this late date.

Date: 4 February 1957
Departed: 2400 hrs, 3 Feb 57 on TWA Constellation
Destination: St. Louis

(I was in the nest on the last seat on the right side of the aircraft.)

Approx. 0145 or 0200, (4 Feb 57) I was gazing out the window watching skyline, just a dark city with no moon that I noticed anyway. There were no city lights to draw my attention. It was somewhat tired, but not sleepy. I kept my head leaning against the window port of my left ear dreaming.

Suddenly, from underneath the aircraft to the right wing, this round 3 still red object comes into view. I just watched it pass by below and disappears from view. It must have been a food 3 or 4 second look at it. All I can say is that it was round and seemed to be illuminated from the inside, not like a reflection, as any thing that looked like windows or openings. I don't recollect from my position it around the edge, it just seemed to be illuminated like stars.

If we never lost any sleep over this, but I've always been wondering what it was. I started to write to TWA once after the flight, but never did. If the opposite had seen it, I believe he would never have made a 360 turn nor together look. A report on this opinion. Nothing has happened to me because of this incident, to my knowledge. I debunk this because I was flying. It was a lot like looking up the side of a jet, but this could also have been something on the ground such as some kind. Comparing the speed it disappeared to give you an idea, it was below us and not above the horizon, if it was above the horizon I think a would have forgotten about it anyway.
