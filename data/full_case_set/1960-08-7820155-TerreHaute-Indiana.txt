TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion or the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? The objects that I saw would about the size of an object between a pin and a pen at arms length.

22. Can you estimate the angular size? Hold a known object such as a pencil at arms length. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had performed this experiment at the time, about how much of the known object would have been covered by the match head? The match head would cover about the same amount that I used to estimate the size of the object.

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes. The object gradually became smaller and disappeared.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw. The only common objects that I could use to describe the size and appearance of the object I saw would be something like a satellite such as Sputnik I or about the size of our largest satellites.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather it shows two sketches illustrating visual perspectives. The first sketch depicts a curved line along which an object is moving, and instructions are provided to imagine the object at different positions along the line. The second sketch shows two larger views, one showing a person on a road and another showing a distant landscape.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (a dotted line).

CODE:

On Aug. 13, 1960, at about 11:13 P.M. I was watching for the launch of a satellite. I saw a small bright object coming from the direction of Terre Haute, Indiana, traveling rapidly at a constant angle. It appeared to be a large conventional aircraft, however it was completely silent and had no lights. As it passed over my head I could not hear any sound. It seemed to be at about 2500-3000 ft. altitude. As it passed over the house I ran outside to watch it, however it had already disappeared from sight by the time I got outside. The whole observation lasted only about 10 seconds. When I ran outside I could see nothing in the sky. I checked the area thoroughly with binoculars but saw no aircraft, either conventional or otherwise. I could not identify the object nor explain what I had seen. It did not fit the description of any known aircraft. I am quite familiar with aircraft, both military and commercial, and this was definitely something unusual. I would like very much to know if anyone else in the area observed the same thing at about the same time.

Unidentified Phenomena/object (blank)
3 OCT 1960

1. Reference copy of attached letter to Lt Col L. Tacker from:

2. The ATIC analysis of (...) a report of an unidentified flying object observed on 15 August 1960, reveals that the objects were probably aircraft. These objects were reported to have appeared to have lights on them and to have been maneuvering. It is generally believed that the lights observed were a normal phenomenon associated with aircraft in flight in that particular area of the southwest. It is quite possible that these objects were two high altitude aircraft which were conducting aerial refueling operations and were seen in conjunction with the satellite which had precessed orbits.

3. It is possible to conclude the high flying aircraft and not something from space. The witness did not receive the outline of a span or wing with binoculars on a dark night. Due to the relativity bright trailing running lights, it is impossible to determine if they were attached to the aircraft itself. 

4. Due to the great amount of traffic through the area, it is impossible to determine the specific aircraft which were observed.

5. "Recommend we send you a copy of the statistics from 1...9 through Jun 1960, and print a copy of the "Noted Cases" per your request."

The text in the document is as follows:

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Terre Haute, Indiana
Date: 13 August 1960
UT (Coordinated Universal Time): 23:15
WX (Weather): Clear, dark sky, no moon
Description: See attached
Direction of Motion: NE to SW
Satellites: (AGIN-43, Phone 66219) This is the direction the object was observed to move.
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): Several unusual observations reported.
Radar Analysis (AGIN-43): -
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): -
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: none observed.
Other: -
Evaluation of Source Reliability: reliable - -
Analysis and Conclusions: the witness observed an unusual aerial phenomenon which moved from northeast to southwest. The object was described as elliptical in shape and emitting a bluish-white light. No specific astronomical or weather phenomena were reported that could account for the sighting. While the witness is considered reliable, without further corroborating evidence, a definitive identification of the observed object cannot be made.

The text in the document is as follows:

5 October 1960

Dear Mr. _____,

This is to acknowledge your letter of 11 September 1960 concerning the unidentified flying object you viewed on 16 August 1960.

The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center's analysis of these objects reveals that they were probably velocities comparable to that of satellites and appeared as two end magnitude lights. These observations indicate typical high-flying aircraft.

It is possible to see the lights of high flying aircraft and not be able to resolve the outlines, even with binoculars, on a dark night. The lights seen by you would be the relatively bright running lights on the bottom of the aircraft.

Due to the great amount of traffic through the area, it is impossible to determine the specific aircraft which were probably responsible.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER

Dear Capt. Waldrop:

I wrote you once before about aircraft in my area when I was checking for a lady. Now I am checking for myself. I have already checked with both airfields at Terre Haute.

Two objects were seen traveling NE to SW at a high altitude. Crossed about 40 to 45 degrees of arc in one minute 43 seconds. The lights were white and stayed the same distance behind each other.

Respectfully yours,

P.S. Time was 11:45 p.m. C.D.T.

The writer has several questions for the recipient, such as inquiring about the Air Force's views on the object they had observed, how many reports the recipient has received, and whether the recipient could send them the relevant fact sheet. The letter ends with the writer expressing gratitude for the recipient's cooperation in answering the questions.

Dear Lt. Colonel Tacker:

Enclosed you will find the report form I sent to you on September 2, 1960. I have filled the report out as best I could. I have several questions that I would like to ask you.

1. When evaluation and analysis is completed on my report will a copy be sent to me so that I too may know what the Air Force thinks the object was that I saw?

2. How many of all the reports that you have received from 1947 to the present concerning U.F.O.'s have not been explained away?

3. Will you please send me the present fact sheet out on U.F.O.'s?

4. What does the Air Force think these objects are? Is it true that many of the Air Force people think these objects are from other planets?

Thank you very much for your co-operation in answering my questions. I am very glad that I have been able to help the United States Air Force.

Respectfully yours,
