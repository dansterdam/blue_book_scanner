The handwritten text is as follows:

"The first thing I noticed when I entered the house was the TV was going off and on. Then as I was leaving I saw a light in the sky over my house. It didn't appear to be very high up. Then it slowly started to descend. Then a cloud came and the light disappeared. Then it went out again, only it was moving. The light started getting wider and the was shaking from side to side. Then it glowed a little brighter again, and the TV came on briefly before the light went away."

The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to study unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains two illustrations, one showing a curved line with angles and angles, and another showing a compass-like symbol. There is also handwritten text describing the illustrations and asking questions about the motion and arrangement of objects.

OCR output:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass to show the direction from which you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

First 6 pairs 6 - 30 sec. 
distinct for 3 - 5 secs each.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how were they arranged? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.

First single line 15 - 30 sec.
