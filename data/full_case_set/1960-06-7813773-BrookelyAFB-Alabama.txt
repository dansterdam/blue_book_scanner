UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Brookley AFB, Alabama
Date: 25 June (EST) 1964 - Hour (2)
WX: see attached
Description: Air Defense Radar - color orange-reddish
Disc shaped - made a sudden turn - speed estimated over 2000 mph
Direction of Motion: East - north
Satellites: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219) - Seen 26 June 1964
Radio: None
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): Possible Meteor
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4R1): n/a
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): -
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Possible high speed aircraft - object was faster than aircraft
Witnesses: Were more than observer - fair than excellent
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Probably good.
Analysis and Conclusions: It is very probable that this observation was a meteor or similar astronomical phenomenon that was observed. The speed and sudden turn indicate this was not a conventional aircraft or other known object.
