NAME:
SIGNATURE: 
DATE:

On June 8, 1961, about 10:30 p.m. or a little after, I saw what appeared to be the silhouette of a man or human figure outlined against the bright sky with a bright white light on top of the head, and there appeared to be a smaller light or glow around the figure.  The figure seemed to be standing still, and gave the impression of being about 200 yards distant from where I was standing.  After observing the figure for about 20 seconds, it seemed to just disappear into the night sky.

1. DATE: 12 Jan 61
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 1900 CST
6. DURATION OF OBSERVATION: 1-2 min
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Witness observed a large brighter than star object with a lot of close, fixed away to the east, remaining stationary for a while on West, then moving N and disappeared. No sound was heard. The object appeared as large as man's hand at arm's length, brightening and fading at intervals.
11. COMMENTS: The object, seen at all probability, was star-like of unusual brightness, momentarily intensifying and moving slightly back and forth but remaining on station for several minutes. No evidence that would indicate this was anything other than a star-like phenomenon, possibly a planet or a bright star affected by atmospheric conditions.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, with various questions and space for handwritten responses.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path of the object's "A" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or one's length to line with a known object and determine how much of the object is covered by the hand of the match. If you had performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match branch?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words any common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance which you saw.

It looks like a detailed questionnaire or report form related to a UFO sighting.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved horizon line with an object above it. The text asks the reader to imagine that they are at the point shown as "A" and to indicate how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when they first saw it.

The second sketch shows a wider landscape view with a person standing in the foreground. The text asks the reader to place the object at the position shown as "A" and to draw another sketch as an example of how to complete the information.
