UFO Observation, 29 July 1967

PAA Control Tower
Springfield Municipal Airport 
Springfield, Missouri  65802

1. The Aerial Phenomena Branch has received a report of an unidentified flying object which was observed from the Springfield Municipal Airport on 29 July 1967. The object was described as white, flashing light that crossed the sky (west to east) in approximately one minute.

2. The description is similar to that of an aircraft observation. Any information you can provide on aircraft in the Springfield area that may have been responsible for this observation will be helpful in our investigation.

In response to your letter of August 22, concerning UFO observation, we can be of little assistance. The controller on duty during the time indicated has no recollection of aircraft being in the area, nor did he see any unusual lights. It is entirely possible that the observer of which the controller was not aware.

If you have not already, I suggest you contact the Watch Supervisor of the Air Route Traffic Control Center at Olathe, Kansas, who may be of assistance.

Proposed reply to letter from July 31, 1967 (Incoming 507.67):

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference your letter of July 31 in which you described the various unidentified flying objects which you have been observing since December 1966. 

At this time, we would be unable to undertake a meaningful scientific investigation into your earlier observations. 

If you would like us to investigate your latter sightings of July 4 and 7, 1967, we will need additional information. Upon completion of this included AFD form 6-2, our analysts will undertake a detailed investigation into your observations.

In the future, if you should observe another unidentified flying object, please contact the nearest military installation at the time of your observations. The UFO investigator at your nearest military installation is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

"Braman Training School
Braman, Vermont
20 July 1967

Air Defense Command
Department of the Air Force

Dear Sirs: 

I am not sure where to direct this letter, but I thought if you were not the proper agency at least you would know.

Last night at about 12:30 I was sitting with a friend in the training school which we live. We were noticing the night sky and suddenly saw a bright light above us. It was moving in a very fast path, zig-zagging back and forth, and finally disappeared over the horizon. My friend was looking directly over my left shoulder and saw the same thing. At that time I looked into the city but could see no other lights without telling her what there was to be seen. She saw the same thing.

I got about a 5-10 second glimpse of it, as she did. It was not only a fleeting glimmer of light but seemed to be a solid object that had a glowing appearance, as a slow moving streak. It appeared to be following an erratic course, but it was able to follow it over. I cannot describe it better than that. It seemed far off in the distance at first, then appeared to be closer and closer until it disappeared from sight. The distance between the lights never varied. The light emitted was a dull glow, pure white, which was never varied. The light was either small and very close, or very large and far away. 

The night was very dark and the air was calm. Visibility was unlimited. All the stars could be seen. The temperature at that time was 55-65°F.

At first I thought it might have been a plane, but there were no running lights, only the two huge glows. I listened for any sound from an engine or other normal source, but there was none. It did not make any sound.

I have been trying to convince myself that it was a very large meteor, but there seems to be two holes in this line of thought:
1) Its luminosity was that of a dull glow rather than a bright light, which is more characteristic of a meteor.
2) The distance between the two glows did not vary, which would seem unusual for a meteor.

Later when I returned I notified the Brandon police to see if they had any more sightings of this object, and to make a report. I have heard nothing further.

Sincerely,
[Signature]"

The text reads:

July 11, 1967

U.S.A.F.
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sirs,

Since December, 1966, I have witnessed four objects which I feel warrant attention as possible U. F. O.'s.

The first sighting occurred on Friday, December 2, 1966. Around 11:00 P.M. I glanced out the kitchen window and noticed a bright red and blinking light curving slowly from west to northeast. It was at a fairly low altitude. I don't feel qualified to estimate its size, but it was similar in appearance and slightly larger than the red light of a water tower about 1 to 2 miles from our house. However, the slower light is not visible off our patio where I was watching.

I observed the thing for about five minutes. It moved erratically, veering from west to northwest. It climbed and then it disappeared behind the houses behind our's. It apparently landed in a field between our house and the water tower.

The image appears to contain an old document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document includes handwritten text describing a UFO sighting. However, the image does not appear to contain any photographs or illustrations - it is solely text.

Here is the text output from the document:

waited another five minutes but it did not reappear.

It was silent and did not resemble any
conventional aircraft that I have ever seen. 
(Much aircraft passes over our house.) It
was an overcast night and no stars were visible. The object appeared intelligently
controlled.

No one was home but myself at the time
and when I told my mother she only laughed. 
A week or so later, F. B. I. sightings occurred in our
area shortly afterward.

Sometime last spring and again on July
4, 1967 at around 10:30 P. M. I witnessed
a similar one on the same object as that of my first
sighting.

My last sighting occurred last Friday,
July 7, 1967 at around 10:30 P. M. It was
exactly like the others except that it was
either smaller or farther away. It was fol-
lowing the opposite course of my first sighting.

My mother saw it also and we watched it
for about five minutes. It was moving east.
We both noted that it moved erratically.
At first it moved at a moderate speed but

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten description of a UFO sighting. The text describes four similar objects that "appeared suddenly and disappeared in the distance." It notes that the objects were not conventional aircraft or heavenly bodies, but were "silently controlled." The text also provides details about the sighting, such as the time it occurred, the course the objects took, and that they landed in approximately the same spot. No humans are identified in the image.

Here is the text transcribed from the image:

"It then spel up suddenly and disappeared in the distance. It was a clear night and stars were visible. This was not a star, meteorite, etc.

All these sightings have much in common:

All four were similar on the same objects.

All four were silent and did not resemble conventional aircraft or heavenly bodies, but did seem to be intelligently controlled. 

With the exception of their last sightings, all followed approximately the same course at approximately the same speed, and all landed in approximately the same spot.

The last sighting was following the opposite course of the others (west veering northwest) and appeared to be either smaller or farther away.

All were sighted between 10:15 P.M. and 11:15 P.M."

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, with handwritten text and some blurry visual elements that resemble film grain or static.

I am fairly certain of my sanity (please don't judge by my typing ability) and I wish you would investigate these strange occurrences.

Sincerely,
