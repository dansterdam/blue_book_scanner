ATTENTION: MCIAOX-3

1. In accordance with FS Regulation 200-1, subject: Unidentified
Flying Objects, dated 2 November 1948, the following report of informa-
tion received concerning the sighting of unidentified flying objects is
submitted.

a. Location and time of sighting: Ten (10) miles northwest of
Mountain Home, Idaho, at 1205 MST, 24 July 1949.

b. Weather at the time; As reported by Mountain Home Air Force
Base for 1130 PST was scattered clouds at five (5) thousand feet, visi-
bility thirty (30) miles.

c. Names, occupations, and addresses of witnesses; The only
individual who reported this sighting was █████████████████
of Ritchie Field, Nampa, Idaho, address Nampa, Idaho.

d. Photographs of objects if available; Photographs of objects
were not available.

e. Sketches of object's configuration; The objects were delta
wings with no protrusions. The angle of the apex as reported by ██████████
was between thirty (30) and forty-five (45) degrees with the base of the
triangle being a slightly curved convex.

f. Objects sighted:

(1) Number; Seven (7) objects were sighted flying in a
V formation.

(2) Shape; In addition to the description in paragraph
the pilot████████ noticed a dark circular structure where
was normally situated. The leading edge of this
dark circular structure was approximately one-fourth
(1/4) the distance from the apex of the delta wing
to the rear. This dark circular structure was
noted at the time █████████ was below the objects.

(3) Size; Larger than an P-51.

(4) Color; Darker than normal aluminum skin and not shiny.
Mr. █████ reported the surface seemed to be between a
light gray and a dirty white with no markings or dif-
fusion of color.

---

(5) Speed: Faster than an F-51 and estimated by Mr. to be at least six (6) hundred miles per hour.

(6) Heading: Mr. reported that when first sighted the formation was heading approximately two (3) hundred degrees. The formation passed by him and then made a one hundred and eighty (180) degree turn to approximately one hundred and twenty (120) degrees.

(7) Maneuverability: Mr. reported that no maneuvers were noted other than the one hundred and eighty (180) degree turn. The objects did not appear to bank during the turn. When the objects were first sighted and before the one hundred and eighty (180) degree turn was made, the outer wing surfaces appeared to move slightly.

(8) Altitude: Mr. reported the formation between eight (8) thousand five (5) hundred and ten (10) thousand feet. When the formation was first sighted Mr. was cruising at ten (10) thousand feet and the objects were slightly below and one-fourth (1/4) of a mile to the left of his position. When the formation made the one hundred and eighty (180) degree turn Mr. descended to eight (8) thousand five (5) hundred feet and was below the formation when they came back.

(9) Sound: No sound was noted from the formation.

(10) Exhaust trail or not: No exhaust trail was visible.

6. General remarks: Mr. was enroute from Burley, Idaho, to Nampa, Idaho, in a Cub Cruiser when the objects were sighted. When the formation was first sighted they were going in approximately the same direction as Mr. and were approximately one-fourth (1/4) of a mile to his left and below. Mr. was cruising at ten (10) thousand feet at this time. He observed the formation until it made the one hundred and eighty (180) degree turn at which time Mr. descended in his aircraft and made a ninety (90) degree turn to the left in an effort to intercept the formation. He was able to get below the level of the formation at eight (8) thousand five (5) hundred feet at which time he noticed the dark circular bulye on the bottom side of the objects. Because of their speed the flying objects soon became lost from the sight of Mr. who proceeded on to his destination. Mr. who states that in his opinion Mr. is a reliable witness.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
          _______verbal account of his sighting was as follows: On 24 July 1949, _______,
was flying his Piper Clipper aircraft (N5622H), from Ogden, Utah en route to ______, Idaho.
was 270 about 1205 hours (MST), was flying at 10,000 feet MSL altitude, with
a heading of about 270 degrees, ten (10) miles from ______, Idaho, when he sighted seven (7)
flying objects at about 7 o'clock, (nose of his plane used as 12 o'clock for this
reference), flying the parallel course, but about 500 feet lower. For an instant as
he had his plane at his left shoulder (he was flying alone in a single cockpit Piper
aircraft), and the objects turned out to be about 25-26 feet across. _____ also
knew that they were right; that he had over 4000 hours. The objects overtook his
aircraft, passing on his left (south side) at about 500 feet distance, at approximately
500 feet lower, or 9500 feet MSL altitude. The objects were flying perfect formation,
to - rows of three (line abreast) and the seventh slightly to the rear about
slightly above the rest. The distance that the formation was vy tight, being about
one-third of the object's span extended from tip of one object to tip of the other
(approximately 15 feet). The same distance was maintained from trailing edge of lead
objects to nose of objects in second line. When the objects had passed
craft, they made a turn to the right, passing about 1500 feet in front of, and 500
feet below ______ the objects again turned to the right, and passed on the right
(north) side of _______banked or skidded. The objects made perfect formation turns, and
in so doing they neither gained or did the objects disturbed that when the objects first
turned, he thought they meant to ram him. As soon as the objects passed to his right,
______ turned his aircraft so that he might keep the objects in view. He stated that
the objects remained in view for approximately 1 or 2 minutes _____ and that their
speed was estimated between 450 and 550 miles an hour.
the objects suddenly disappear at approximately ten (10) miles distance from him.

        In describing the objects, _____ said they were delta shaped flying wings to
estimated their span as being between that of an F-51 and an A-26 aircraft (35. 55
feet), & their length (nose to trailing edge) at about 20 to 30 feet, and their
thickness from 2 to 5 feet. _____said that the objects were light color except
for a circle or dark color or approximately 12 feet in diameter which was placed
midway between th tips of the object, and which extended to the trailing edge of the
object (see sketch). _____said that he could not describe the colors---they were

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
white and blue; except that they were shades of white and black that he had never seen before. said that the top of the object was primarily flat, and that the bottom of the object was flat except for a shallow dome-like protrusion of approximately 10-12 feet in diameter, with a depth of approximately 2-5 feet.
stated that he saw no propeller arc or any row or row of exhaust flames or stacks. So far as he could tell the were no air intakes or jet or rocket openings. Stated that the objects flew with unusual stability and appeared to be under absolute control at all times. stated that to best of his knowledge the objects were no audible sound, but that the smaller object was square, as though sawed off, level; a flat surface. thinks that the second, or a trailing object, stated that when first sighted by him, his rottation an oscillation of the of the outer panels of the objects, stated said he oscillation decreaseed as the objects approached.
stated that it was a smooth oscillation, not a flutter. a skewed-emphasized the fact that when the objects turned they did so without a bank or a swerve. also stated that it appeared that to objects had used approximately 1/2 as turning point, maintaining a standard turn about disaopearata at approximately a mile distance. stated that when the objects airborne from sight, they did not raise or lower but disappeared. There was no gradual fading from view, 
stated. First estimated that speed of the objects as somewhere btween 550 and 650 miles per hour; then stated that they were traveling not quite that fast. Also to the fact that the circle in the center of the objects changed color slightly from time to time, and that the oscillation or movement of the outer panels was down to about 30 degrees, then to a flush position. stated that he had a good view from all angles except below and to the left.

stated that as he passed th. flight path of the objects he expected a great amount of turbulence, ant that he was surprised when he felt nothing. as soon as he had passed the objects' flight path, however, he noticed that his engine began running rough. stated and engine are brand new. His engine is a Lycoming 4-cylinder opposed, 115 horsepower.) Soon after landed, he had one of his mechanics inspect the engine, and it was found that all of his spark plugs had been shorted and burned out.

These plugs, except for one that could not be located were forwarded directly

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

NARRATIVE SUMMARY
from A'Timeno AFB to Wright–Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, on 28 July 1949, for analysis, in accordance with their instructions. Only seven of the original eight plugs were forwarded because Mr. ______ had discarded all eight prior to the arrival of the writer and the subsequent search for them revealed only seven.

Soon after ____ had lost sight of the objects, at approximately 1212 hours, MST, he called Boise Radio, Gowen Field, Boise, Idaho, and told them that it was an emergency transmission and then asked them to check for any aircraft in his vicinity. He was later notified by Boise Radio that atOrchard Field, Washington, Hill AFB, Utah, Oregon, Utah, and intermediate points had been checked, and that no aircraft had been near his aircraft at the time of his sighting. ______ further stated that the sky was less than 1/10 covered, and that there was no mist or haze; the only clouds being; tufts at approximately 12,000 to 14,000 feet MSL.

______ stated that he has been flying for twenty-one (21) years, and produced a log book that indicated that Clark had 15,933.25 hours air time (all civilian time.) ______ holds Commercial License #29281, Flight Intructor and Flight Examiner License #72, and Airplane and engine license #1229. It is concluded from this that x_______ vision and judgment are excellent.

Lewiston, Idaho
July 25, 1949

Base Intelligence Officer
Spokane Air Force Base
Spokane, Washington

Dear Sir:

This letter is to inform you of possible aircraft over Lewiston last night. It is probably useless information but after reading the Associated Press report of a Boise pilot seeing "flying objects" over southern Idaho yesterday, I decided to send you this report anyway.

I am a weather observer at the Weather Bureau Office at the Lewiston Municipal Airport. Was on duty yesterday from 1600P to 2400P. About 2310P I went outside to see if there were any clouds in the sky. The sky was clear. As I was about to go back inside I heard a faint noise. It sounded like a formation of several aircraft at high altitude west of the airport. The noise increased and decreased in volume intermittently, as if they were circling. After about five minutes of this the noise faded gradually and I returned to the office. While listening I was also looking for aircraft lights but saw none. If there were any it probably would have been easy to miss them against the background of bright stars, and as I said before, the noises seemed to come from a high altitude.

I have told nobody, except in this letter, about what I heard and do not intend to tell anybody. Also I will not tell anybody about this letter.

In case you are interested, here is my military experience: Served with the AAF from Feb. 12, 1942 to March 1, 1946. Was a Weather Forecaster, A.I.O.S. 787, T/Sgt., A.S.N.

If you have any questions about this, I will be glad to cooperate with you in any way possible.

Yours very truly,

1. Forwarded herewith, in compliance with your request of 27 July
1949, are seven (7) spark plugs which were taken from Aircraft Number
N5622A, a Piper "Clipper" on 25 July 1949. The eighth spark plug from
this aircraft had been thrown away and could not be located.

2. Subject aircraft had on 2 July at 1203 hours (lST) been ap-
proached within 1500 feet by seven (7) unidentified aerial objects,
according to Mr. --------- of Mountain Home, Idaho, who was flying
subject aircraft at time of incident. As soon as Mr. --------- flew his;
aircraft through the flight path of the objects, he states that his
engine began running rough. Upon landing, Mr. --------- had plane in-
spected and found that all the spark plugs from the Lycoming engine which
powers his plane, had been shorted, and that the insulation of the plugs
had been broken down. Mr. --------- states that his plane and engine are
new, and have less than 20 hours time.

3. A complete report of Mr. --------- account of the incident is presently
enroute to your office through District Headquarters, 16th District.

4. The plugs which are forwarded herewith, were removed from
aircraft about 1600 hours (lST) 21 July 1949, and were thrown into a
trash can where they remained until 1630 hours (lST) 25 July 1949. From
1630 hours, 25 July 1949, subject plugs were kept in the container in
which they are herewith forwarded.

SPECIAL INQUIRY (Unidentified Aerial Objects)

DETAILS:

1. Investigation initiated upon appearance of an article, by Mr. DAVE JOHNSON, Aviation Editor,"Idaho Morning Statesman" Boise, Idaho, in that same publication.

AT NAMPA, IDAHO

2. This investigation conducted by the writer.

3. At approximately 1600 hours, 25 July 1949, this agent arrived at the office of Mr. ------ Owner and Manager of a Flying Service, Nampa, Idaho, where ------ was contacted. ------ completed a form supplied by Headquarters, Air Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, entitled "Essential Elements of Information (Re Sightings of Unidentified Aerial Objects) PROJECT STIGN". See Inclosure No. 2.

------ 's verbal account of his sighting was as follows: On 24 July 1949, ------ was flying his Piper Clipper aircraft (N5622H), from Ogden, Utah en route to Nampa, Idaho, ------ at about 1203 hours (MST), was flying at 10,000 feet MSL altitude, with a heading of 270 degrees, ten (10) miles from Mt Home, Idaho, when he sighted seven (7) flying objects about 7 o'clock, (nose of his plane used as 12 o'clock for this reference,) flying a parallel course, but about 500 feet lower. For an instance, ------ said he believed the objects to be F-51's or A-26's, on second glance, ------ said he knew that they were nothing that he had ever seen before. The objects overtook his aircraft, passing on his left (south side) at about 1500 feet distance, at approximately 500 feet lower, or 9500 feet MSL altitude. The objects were flying perfect formation, two rows of three (line abreast) and the seventh slightly to the rear and maybe slightly above the rest. The objects span the formation was very tight, being about one-third of the object's stated that the formation tip of one object to tip of the other (approximately 15 feet). The same distance was maintained from trailing edge of lead object’s to nose of objects in second line. When the objects had passed approximately 150 feet away, they made a turn to the right, passing about 1500 feet in front of, and 50% feet below a turn in the objects again turned to the right, and passed on the right (north) side of doing neither banked or skidded. ------ stated that when the objects first turned, he thought they meant to ram him. As soon as the objects passed to his right, ------ turned his aircraft so that he might keep the objects in view. He stated that the objects remained in view for approximately 1 or 2 minutes in all, and that their speed was estimated between 450 and 550 miles an hour. ------ said that he watched the objects suddenly disappear at approximately ten (10) miles distance from him.

5. In describing the objects, ------ said they were delta shaped flying wings. He estimated their span as being between that of an F-51 and an A-26 aircraft (35 to 55 feet), their length (nose to trailing edge) at about 20 to 30 feet, and their thickness at from 2 to 5 feet. ------ said that the objects

were a light color except for a circle of dark color of approximately 12
feet in diameter which was placed midway between the tips of the object, and
which extended to the trailing edge of the object (see sketch). [Redacted] said
that he could not describe the colors--they were white and black, except that
they were shades of white and black that he had never seen before. [Redacted]
said that the top of the object was perfectly flat, and that the bottom of
the object was flat except for a shallow dome-like protrusion of approximately 
10-12 feet in diameter, with a depth of approximately 2-5 feet. [Redacted] stated
that he saw no propellor arcs and saw no jet exhaust or smoke. So far
as he could tell there were no air intakes or jetty and rockets openings. [Redacted]
stated that the objects flew with unusual stability and appeared to be under
absolute control at all times, but that on trailing edges were square, as
though came to a Nevada flat surface, the thickness of the object, as
trailing edge of, [illegible] a stand that when first sighted by him, he noticed an
oscillation of part of the outer panels of the object. [Redacted] said this
oscillation decreased as the objects approached, to the point that it was
a smooth oscillation, not a flutter. [Redacted] re-emphasized the fact that when
the objects turned they did so without a bank or a skid. He also said that it
appeared that the objects had used his aircraft as a turning point, maintaining
a standard turn about his aircraft at approximately 1/4 mile distance. [Redacted]
stated that when the objects disappeared from sight, they disappeared all of a
sudden. There was no gradual fading from view, [Redacted] first
estimated the speed of the objects as something between 550 and 650 miles per
hour; then stated that maybe they were traveling not quite that fast. Also
from time to time, the circle in the center of the object changed color slightly
from [Redacted] stated that the oscillation or movement of the outer panels was
down to about 30 degrees, then to a flush position. [Redacted] stated that he had
a good view from all angles except below and to the left.

[Redacted] stated that as he passed the flight path of the objects he
expected a great amount of turbulence, and that he was surprised when he felt
nothing. As soon as he had passed the objects' flight path, however, he
noticed that his engine began running rough. [Redacted] aircraft and engine
are brand new. His engine is a Lycomnig, 115 horsepower. Soon after [Redacted] had he and one of his mechanics inspect the engine, and
it was found that all of his spark plugs had been shorted and burned out.

a. These plugs, except for one that could not be located were
forwarded directly from Mt Home AFB to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton,
Ohio, on 28 July 1949, for analysis, in accordance with their instructions.
Only seven of the original eight plugs were forwarded because [Redacted] had
discarded all eight prior to the arrival of the writer and the subsequent
search. After them revealed only seven.

12. 7. Soon after [Redacted] had lost sight of the objects, at approximately
anm hours, MST, he callg Boise Radio, Gowen Field,, Boise, Idaho, and told
them that it was an emergency transmission and that asked them to check for
any aircraft in his vicinity. He was later notified by Boise Radio that

The image appears to be a hand-drawn illustration of a triangular-shaped object with a circular center. The circular area is densely filled with lines, giving the impression of texture or pattern. The triangular portions extend outward evenly on all three sides, appearing as symmetrical wings or fins. The label "TOP VIEW" is written above the image, suggesting that this is a representation of the object as seen from above.

As an AI, I am unable to provide OCR text extraction from images. Please provide text for analysis or describe another task I may assist you with.

The image shows a simple line drawing, a sketch labeled with the words "Front View." There is no actual photograph present. The sketch appears to represent some sort of object with a flat top and a concave underside. Below the sketch on the right side, there is a handwritten note that reads "Sketch approved by."

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch, not a photograph. The sketch appears to depict a side view of an unidentified flying object (UFO), with a shape resembling that of a classic saucer or disc. The top part is flat, and the bottom is curved, with a straight protrusion that seems to represent a stabilizing feature or perhaps a part of the object's structure. Above the sketch, the text "Side View" is written, indicating that this is the side perspective of the object depicted.
