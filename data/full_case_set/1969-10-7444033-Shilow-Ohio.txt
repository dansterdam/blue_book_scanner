The image contains two black and white illustrations. The top illustration is a compass rose, which appears to be providing instructions on how to indicate the direction of a phenomenon when it is first seen. The bottom illustrations show two sketches - one appears to be a landscape view, and the other appears to be a smaller sketch provided as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

DATA TRANSFER:

14. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a blank page in an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with text instructions at the top on how to describe a photograph if one were present. Since there is no photograph in this image, I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document.

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WELL AS POSITION, AND INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

ALSO ESTIMATE HOW IT COMPARED IN BRIGHTNESS, LIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE MOON'S DIAMETER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
