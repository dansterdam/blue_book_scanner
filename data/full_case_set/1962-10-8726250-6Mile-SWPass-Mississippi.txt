Jacksonville, Florida

On October 4, 1962, two power failure occurred within a period of 15 minutes. One was in the southwestern part of Jacksonville, the other was in a wide area covering the Northside and Arlington areas. The witnesses reported that when the power failed, they looked out and saw a large bright object hovering over their homes. Mrs. Baker said she looked out and saw the object hovering over and across the road, and it was so bright she had to shield her eyes. The object then went straight up at a high rate of speed and the power came back on. The witnesses across the areas where the power failed also saw the bright object go straight up and the power came back on. The case appears to be one of the more unusual power failure cases on record.

GLOWING LIGHTS INVADE HOME
On Pampas Drive, which connects with Spring Park Road, an unidentified woman (by request) said a formless "glow" moved through her house, and about a half a block long, and brilliant illuminated car and objects in the yard, that as the glow moved through the house, it moved...and this glow hand light children screamed, through fear. 
Mrs. Gladys Pawette of Cascade Road, the street from which Mrs. Bakers' fire-hall screamed to come, said she saw a glow about 2 feet long between her home and the adjacent house. She said the form was too vague to identify, but called it a "terribly big brilliance." She said the circuit which carries electricity to her bathroom and bedroom was burned out about this time, and was still out the next morning.

It turned, sharply changing direction, and seemed to be oscillating or vibrating as it moved rapidly across the sky. It was a bright light, larger than a star, and finally it disappeared over the horizon. The object was seen at a distance of about six miles southwest of Formosa, Argentina by an unspecified number of people. The report indicates that the observation was close at hand, with the object displaying unusual and fast maneuvers."

ASTRONOMY

VENUS AT GREATEST BRILLIANCE

Venus, the brightest of the naked-eye planets, Mercury, will come into view in the evening sky. Shelley reports.

THE PLANET VENUS, which has been conspicuously in the evening sky for the last several months, will reach its greatest brilliance shortly. This is its last fling, however, for by the middle of October it will have passed beyond our line of sight, having reached a point where it is no longer visible in the evening.

Other bright planets--Saturn, Jupiter and Mars--will be in the sky this evening, and one can see them shine against the background of stars about an hour after sunset.

Only Venus, however, will be visible for some time, for it does not set until about three hours after sunset, and its afternoon appearance and evening appearance are fully ten weeks apart. Observers at the equator or in middle northern latitudes can see Venus at its brightest about ten weeks earlier or at the end. Venus sets too early, and stars rise too late, in the southern hemisphere.

Venus sets about an hour and a half after sunset, so that during most of September it can be seen shining brightly in the western sky even after sunset. Its greatest brilliance, which has a magnitude value of minus 4.3 on the astronomical scale, will occur on September 29--the first day of the autumnal equinox. At this time Venus will appear nearly three times as bright as Sirius, the brightest star in the sky.

In fact, Venus can be seen even while the sun is still up, shortly before sunset. Its brilliance during the daytime is such that it can occasionally be glimpsed with the naked eye.

Jupiter's magnitude is October 11 minus 2.1, Saturn's magnitude is October 14 minus 0.5, while Mars on October 16 has a magnitude of plus 1.2. These are the brightest of the planets, Jupiter being the brightest, and Saturn being the second brightest, while both Mars and Venus are much brighter than the first-magnitude stars.

Venus, It is said, is at its greatest brilliance for about two weeks before and two weeks after September 29, and is visible for some time after sunset and a little earlier than Saturn, in the evening.

Among the stars, the brightest is Venus, in the evening sky. Sirius, which is high in the south about 9:30, and Arcturus, in the northwest, are next in brightness. The brightest star directly overhead is Vega, the eagle's star, in Lyra. Above and to the left of Vega is Altair, the eagle, and still higher, Deneb, the swan's tail.

Other stars of interest in the evening sky are Capella, the goat, which is in the northeast, and Fomalhaut, in the south, which has a reddish color.

Satellite Radio Link
Planned for America
PROJECT RELAY, the communications
satellite which will link North America and
Europe directly for the first time, is being
prepared for launching late this year, it was
announced in Nutley, N. J.
The launching will be by National Aeronautics and Space Administration from Cape
Canaveral and the satellite will be placed in

First Live Color
Television From Europe
TELSTAR, the communications
satellite which has broadcast the
first live television from Europe to
the U.S. and vice versa, is believed to
be the first commercial satellite to
transmit high-quality color television pictures. The picture was transmitted in color to Washington, D. C.
It was the first time the satellite
has been used for color television
transmissions.

Radiation Belt No Hazard
Geostationary Satellites

TELSTAR VI, the latest research weather
satellite aimed for use primarily in the near
future, is expected to transmit clear pictures
and collect useful radiation data without presenting a hazard from trapped radiation belt
particles, according to George Ludwig of
Princeton University.
Some space shots have been delayed by the
hazardous radiation of the Van Allen belts,
said Ludwig, an astrophysicist for the U.S.
National Satellite Weather Center.
Telstar VI, named Nimbus III, is due to
orbit at 700 miles from the earth during August, Sept., Oct. and its weak signals will be
relayed to the U.S. Weather Bureau.
During the extreme success of the research
satellite mission, some satellites have experienced occasional failures attributed to the
"higher than expected" radiation belts.
Telstar, the first "open" from the weather spy, as well
as others other communications satellites are
planned by the Communications Satellite Corp.
to be used operationally until the
1964 system becomes available
to the public.
These weather satellites equipped with
vehicles was launched at the end of August.
The electronic boxes protecting the equipment
and extending the useful life of the satellite
have withstood the Van Allen belt radiation remarkably well, it will take at least several
months before recharge of the orbiting batteres is necessary, Dr. Ludwig reported.
Telstar system has just been subject of
checks by the U.S. and its counterparts in
Europe. Technical problems have been ironed
out and the satellite will be available for its
inaugural services said Dr. Ludwig.

Instrument Packages to
Reach Venus After 1965
A new series of Venus probes will be launched
landing on the hidden surface sometime
after 1965.
The packages, specially designed, will be
dropped from a Venus orbiter, then will radio
back data during the descent and operation
on the surface.
Another Mariner fly by Venus in 1964.
A new sophisticated Mariner that can
carry an additional 300 pounds
of science gear to Mercury and
Venus on the planet's encounter course
was approved by NASA and will be
launched in 1964 or 1975.
Earlier Mariner flights in 1962 and 1973 will be
paving the way for the 1964 vehicle's more
complicated mission of detailed
study of Venus and Mercury.

COMMUNICATIONS cable that looks like ordinary telephone cable has been developed by the Navy Ordnance Test Station at China Lake, Calif. and the Bell Telephone Laboratories at Hickory, N. C. and Stopless Wire & Cable Company, Canton, Mass. The technique for manufacturing, installing, and using this cable, which can be transmitted throughout Europe, makes possible "beyond the horizon" communication with modest transmitter power. The cable's insulation strength and anticipated long life make it attractive for many commercial and military applications.
The air-insulated cable is expected to have long life and wear, with high dielectric strength. According to both Simplex and Superior, for VCNG, this type of information transmission should result in reduced maintenance over existing solid dielectric cables. Technical details are not available at this time, but applications for telephonic communication, railroad and utility installations (railroad, community, and military systems) are indicated in the patent claims.

SILVER BALL SEEN IN ONTARIO

At 12:10 a.m. on Monday, October 1, 1962, a silver ball the size of a basketball was reported hovering near the village of Jarvis, Ontario, Canada. It was first seen hovering about 100 feet above the ground and then rose rapidly out of sight at midnight and no explanations were forthcoming from investigators. The London Free Press informed one inquirer that "it would probably be some sort of phenomenon, perhaps a celestial body." But the observers said "it was different" and that "there have been numerous articles on all this before in the local newspapers." "So, after analyzing all the answers, we never seem to look at another object again like it. Well, that's the way it is." This seems to be good advice, inasmuch as no further explanation is offered beyond what the local press had already stated.
