The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Project 10073 Record Card from the Air Force's Project Blue Book, which investigated UFO sightings. The text on the card provides details about a UFO sighting that occurred on 3 September 1956 in Washington, D.C. The text describes the object as one single size, sighted at arm's length, and moving with vertical motions. The observer concluded that the object was probably caused by a temperature inversion, although its direction of sighting and behavior did not fully support this conclusion.
