"Farmer Tells of Watching G-54 Launch Flying Saucer
Dowagiac, Mich., July 6 - A young, hard-working farmer not given to seeing things' was reported watching a flying saucer launched from an Army G-54 on June 29.

"John Keller made the report to the Dowagiac newspaper, and said his two young sons would verify his statements.

"Keller said he watched a saucer shaped like an automobile hub cap, about 25 to 30 feet in diameter, and 12 to 15 feet thick, launched from a G-54. He said the launching took place about a quarter of a mile from where he was riding a tractor, in a hay field.

"The plane was heading southwestt at a low rate of speed, about 300 feet up, when the saucer came from the belly of the plane. It climbed rapidly and was soon lost due south. It easily outdistanced the G-54 and was out of sight in five seconds.

"It looked like a gigantic hub cap or half of a sphere. It's top side looked like chrome and had a little dome protruding, and the bottom was dull gray. I didn't believe it until I saw it', Keller is quoted as saying.

"His sons, Larry and Johnny, then he saw 'the launching.'"
