The object was observed to be about 10 feet in diameter and 150 feet long. The object was metallic silver in color and appeared to have bright blue lights on each side. The object had two fins or stabilizers in the back and was traveling at a high rate of speed. The object was tracked for about 10 minutes by the witnesses before it disappeared from sight. Other watchers had observed similar objects in the past, but this was the first time a balloonlike object was launched from Victoria, Texas at 0515. The observer stated that it looked like a balloon of some type.

UFO OVER LA PORT IS REPORTED BY WITNESS

Four men reported seeing a UFO over La Porte, Texas on the evening of November 8, 1966. According to the report, the object was seen at about 6:45 p.m. and was observed for about 15 minutes. The object was described as being about 125 feet in diameter, round in shape, and glowing with a bluish-white color. It moved slowly across the night sky and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared. The witnesses estimated the UFO was about 1,000 feet in altitude when it was first observed. The report states that the object made no sound and appeared to be controlled.

Victoria Launschlin, A Weather Balloon?
The unidentified flying object/vehicle, They said it was cigar shaped, sighted over La Porte, Texas at 5:15 a.m. Sunday probably was a weather balloon launched from Victoria, Texas, according to Clyde Young, meteorologist at the Victoria Weather Station.
The object was seen by several persons, including Victoria Launschlin, who called it a "UFO." It looked about 15-20 feet long and 5-6 feet in diameter, and was sighted in a westerly direction, moving slowly at first but then accelerating and moving out of sight in about 10-15 minutes. The object also was seen by other persons in other directions.
According to Young, the object likely was a weather balloon launched from Victoria at about 4:30 a.m., which would account for its location and movements as described. He said weather balloons of that type are quite common in the area.

9. Unusual Meteorological Account for UFO Sighting: None (see comments of investigating officer).

10. Air Traffic and Balloon Releases:
(A) Remarks: The observer reported seeing what he thought was a jet fighter type aircraft producing a con-trail approach the UFO from the west at an altitude much higher than the UFO. When the jet reached the UFO, both stopped and hovered for a few seconds, then the jet turned and proceeded in a northerly direction. The observer did not think the jet could have seen the UFO because of the higher altitude. No jet aircraft departed from Ellington weather station stated that jet aircraft would produce con-trails at 25,000 feet and higher.

The image does not contain any photographs. The text in the document states "No photographs were taken."

b) Balloon: The U. S. Weather Bureau released a weather balloon from its weather station at Victoria, Texas, at 0515 on the date of the sighting. The description indicates that the path of this balloon was tracked from the weather station's official records. These records indicated the balloon burst at an altitude of 62,000 feet almost two hours before the UFO sighting could have occurred. It appears that this balloon could not be an explanation for the UFO sighting.

31. Photographic evidence: No photographs were taken.

32. Conclusions: Although investigation did not disclose any other balloon launches, it was his opinion that this was a balloon of some type. The investigation could not uncover any other logical explanation for this UFO sighting.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old project Blue Book document detailing assigned radio frequencies for air navigation.

ASSIGNED RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR AIR NAVIGATION
Stations in different countries are assigned different frequencies for their particular needs. These frequencies are allocated and protected by international agreements.
This is a list of some of the more important frequencies assigned for various air navigation and communications purposes.
