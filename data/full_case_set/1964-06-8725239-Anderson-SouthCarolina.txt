Flying Objects Puzzle
North Georgia Residents
Persons in South Georgia who reportedly saw strange objects in the sky early last week are not alone, it appears.
Residents of the North Georgia area were also puzzled about what they saw in the sky early last week.
Last Monday a Toccoa, Ga., woman said she saw a strange object streaking across the sky about 11 p.m. She described it as a brilliant glow and an elongated object.
A number of Gainesville, Ga., residents also reported seeing a strange object in the sky early Thursday morning of last week.
Several persons in the Toccoa and Gainesville areas said they saw an elongated object with a brilliant glow moving rapidly across the sky.
The object was seen about 4 a.m. and witnesses said it appeared to be changing color. A number of persons in Elberton, Ga., also reported seeing the strange object.
The next Tuesday night, one week later, little Patty Upchurch came running into the house in what her father described as "a state of panic." She and a friend had been in the back yard and had seen something strange in the sky.

The image contains a typed document with the title "Strange Objects Traveling a Trail of Light". The document describes an incident where multiple people in Greenville, South Carolina witnessed an unidentified flying object on the night of June 4, 1964. The document includes details about the sighting, such as the object being described as circular in shape and emitting a bright light, and how it flew silently over the area for several minutes before disappearing. The document also mentions that the object was photographed, though the image is not present in this particular page.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Strange Objects Traveling a Trail of Light

On June 4, 1964, a number of inhabitants of the Greenville, South Carolina, area reported seeing a very unusual flying object. Several persons said they had never seen anything like it before.

According to eyewitness accounts, the object was first observed at around 8:30 p.m. It was circular in shape and was emitting a very bright light. The object flew silently over the area for several minutes, leaving a trail of light behind it.

After being seen by many people, the object finally disappeared from view. A number of people tried to photograph the object, but it is not known if any of the photographs were successful.

The sighting was investigated by military authorities, who were said to be very interested in the incident. Those who saw the object were interviewed, and their descriptions of what they had seen were obtained.

Whatever the object was, it certainly caused a great deal of excitement and speculation among the inhabitants of the Greenville area on that June evening in 1964.

THE MACON NEWS, Thursday, July 16, 1964

Unidentified Flying Object With Bad Smell Reported in Toccoa

TOCCOA, Ga. (UPI)--An unidentified flying object accompanied by an "offensive odor" was reported near the South Carolina border.

Wilford Reid, a police counter intelligence officer, said the object, described as being white and round, came in low over a field and gave off a bad smell. Reid said he and a group of 20 persons observed the object for 10 or 15 minutes as it hovered 75 to 100 feet over the field.

According to Reid, the object appeared to be the size of an automobile and was traveling at about 600 miles per hour. It made no noise and left no trace of its presence, he said.

The incident was reported early Tuesday night, but no explanation of what the object was has been given so far.

DRAFT/S AS-C OPPY 

This is in reply to your letters of recent date
relating to the sighting of Defense and so members
of the Air Force, in further reference to unidentified
flying objects.

The project Blue Book Office at Wright Patterson
Air Force Base has queried the personnel of Anderson
Airport, South Carolina, concerning the report of an
unidentified flying object by Mr.
Mr. Woodcock of the Federal Aviation Agency at Anderson
stated unequivocally that he found no trace of radio-
activity on Mr. when he based it with a
Geiger counter. Mr. Woodcock informed personnel at
Warner Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, of this incident,
and it was investigated by personnel at that Base. The
phenomena was determined to be St. Elmo's fire. The
report was not forwarded to the investigating office at
Wright Patterson since it was evaluated on the same and
there was no need for additional investigation.

The Air Force will continue its investigation of
unidentified flying objects as directed from the Department of Defense. Reports will continue to be analyzed and
evaluated, and releases made to the public when warranted.

Project Blue Book: Int. Officer
The Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 

Dear Sir:

In reference to my letter concerning a UFO sighting by a Mr. Learned Barham of Hallandale, South Florida and investigation of his sighting on the night of 28 June 1964.

I have heard from Mr. J.A. Long, Administrative Assistant of the Air Force Reserve in Atlanta, regarding his conversations with the investigators of Anderson Field, S.C. NOT TO BE RADIOACTIVE.

Today I received a signed letter from Mr. Farham in which he states you were given false information by the U.S.A.F. man who is in conversation with him. Mr. Farham states they did not receive three (3) witnesses to the original readings on his car and THEY WERE RADIOACTIVE.I do not believe the investigation has been thorough enough to warrant the conclusion of "Not To Be Radioactive" and I ask most serious that this investigation be gone into more carefully.

The three witnesses Mr. Farham has are (3) reporters and they would be hard to find by F.A.A. officials to the Government Investigators. I don't consider this case closed and would like your document and further evaluation of same as soon as possible.

Mr. Farham can be contacted for further information or I can send you a photo-copy of his signed letter.

Please indicate it you can continue this investigation and what action, if any, I am to take.

Sincerely yours,

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

This is in reply to your letter in regard to a possible UFO sighting on June 4, 1964. The information you provided indicates that the observed object was not likely an aircraft or spacecraft. The object was apparently a bright red light, partially obscured by haze, that stayed stationary for several minutes before moving away.

The Air Force has thoroughly investigated this incident and concluded that the observed object was likely a celestial body or a known type of aircraft. The object's behavior and appearance do not match the characteristics typically associated with unidentified flying objects.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. The Air Force appreciates citizens reporting potential UFO sightings, as it helps us better understand the nature of such phenomena. However, in this case, the evidence suggests a conventional explanation. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,

SIGHTING : MAN BURNED BY FLYING SAUCER IN GEORGIA: A thoroughly frightening occurrence was reported by Galene Nash in her article of June 29th. 1964, in a North Carolina magazine. A young man who was parked along a highway had a flying saucer descend upon his car, and a beam of light struck him, severely burning him.

According to the report, the young man's automobile stalled, and he saw a brilliantly lighted object hovering about 70 feet above him. The object descended rapidly, and a beam of light was directed at him, burning him severely. He was able to restart his car and drive off, but the UFO followed him for a considerable distance, and gave off terrific heat.

Parhaps said that he could remember nothing more about the incident than that it was terrifying and that he felt intense heat. There were ground markings found on the spot where the incident occurred, and tire marks were found as well. The heat from the UFO was so intense that it scorched the ground in one direction only.

No photograph accompanied this report.

Object buzzes car
We are indebted to Mrs. Charlotte for the following account from the diary of the Reverend Melvin J. Parsons:
"On the following Sunday (June 29), while he was driving home from Lancaster, at about 8:00 P.M., he noticed a bright light in the sky ahead of him. This light came closer and seemed to be hovering over the road. As the Reverend Parsons approached, the object suddenly darted up and down and from side to side, just above his car. It appeared to be pacing his car and was no more than 30-40 feet off the ground. It cast a white beam of light down on the car. The Reverend Parsons said the object was about 30 feet in diameter and seemed to have a red-orange center with a bright white light around the outside. He estimated it was hovering 50-60 feet above the road.
"As the Reverend Parsons watched, the object suddenly shot straight up and disappeared from sight. The entire incident lasted about a minute and a half. Afterward, the Reverend Parsons said his car motor seemed to be affected.
"A.C. Mancine, a newspaperman, said on Thursday night, June 25, while driving on Highway 521 near Lancaster, he saw a bright light flash across the sky. It moved vertically down, hovered and then shot straight up and disappeared. Mancine said he notified the local sheriff's office, but no one else reported seeing the object."
