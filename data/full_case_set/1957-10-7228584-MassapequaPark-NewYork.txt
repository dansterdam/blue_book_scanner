Sirs:

This is for the UFO section of the "To whom it may concern" department; our Sensible Flight Sargent reports that he has had a strange occurrence within his section of the circular flight tests going on.

Matter of fact, the winds were and still are what could be called "hallucinations", and objects including those that can be explained as regular targets. F-51's, F-84's and F-86's, appear to be zigzagging rapidly in their flight paths. This sort of thing has happened before, but the odd maneuvers observed this time appear to have no reasonable explanation - as if to the leit with someone else's control. 

At this time I do not think I'm completely on flying status in the Reserve, but I would very much appreciate your personal, confidential comments, as you have already indicated you are normally one (still on flying status in the Reserve). You see, I don't want the report to appear to be a "phony", based on any impressions that I still get the flying pay. Also, I think from my experience, one or two other officers including the ones involved in the flights are convinced of the sincerity of the officer who made the report. Please let me know what you think.

So may I normally confident, there was no hallucination involved, as the objects appeared to zigzag, shift positions, and accelerate at a rate of speed that was astounding to normal jet pilots. As they would go north, through an arc to the east, then south and through an arc to the west, they would reach a velocity that appeared to be faster than the fastest jet, and then again slow down to a crawl - so as to linear velocity. But the angular velocity seemed incredible. I think if these were the brightest planets, the maneuvers would still have been astounding, and I have a feeling these were not the brightest planets.

A weather would of course be the nearest natural phenomena, but I tend to discard that as a possibility, since these appeared to be silent, motionless, and having a trajectory entirely different from our modern jets.

On the million-to-one chance this has any relevance to your work, I remain,

Very truly yours,

The image provided appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a map and text discussing "See Fall Constellations".

The text is as follows:

See Fall Constellations
Some of the constellations which were visible in the southern sky during October, which also brings an unusual stellar eclipse visible from Antarctica.
By JAMES STOKLEY

The image also contains a map showing the constellations of the zodiac, with labels for the different constellations.

The image does not contain any photographs, only text. As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

The object was seen in Massapequa Park, Long Island, on 7 October 1957. The witness was a woman who observed the object for approximately 45 minutes. The object was circular in shape, silver in color, and hovered at an altitude of about 150 feet. At times it seemed to oscillate or wobble. The object had no visible means of propulsion, yet it moved silently across the sky. The object vanished suddenly, as if switching off a light.

It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report or document, with text describing what seems to be a UFO sighting over London, England on October 28th. The text mentions a "UFO with lights seen over one of Britain's Atomic-Bomber bases" and provides some details about the incident, though it does not identify any individuals.

Oct.28--London--UFO with lights seen over one of Britain's Atomic-Bomber bases by a USAF-Fighter-Pilot & picked up by Radar. Object turned-off its lights & was discovered according to the report "accelerating at an unbelievable speed away from the fighter in a matter of seconds."

Shipparr Point,
Stonford, Conn.
December 17, 1957.

United States Air Force Intelligence Center, 
Wright Patterson Air Force Base.
Attention: Colonel W. Elwood, 
Assistant Adjutant.

Dear Sir:

Enclosed please find a clipping from one of the New York papers. The difference being that this object was just passing by us for routes unknown. The object appeared to be hovering for a considerable length of time, and I am wondering if you would be interested in having details about it - or perhaps even using them for fuel. As far as I am concerned, I am not waiting to you about the flying objects seen over the New Jersey coast (CAN DID) , and I would just like to write about space government and classification between the people and the government. The little of them I have left, is very strange.

So that I would like to have permission to have my sighting released, along with the look also deals with unexplainable objects.

Very truly yours,
[Signature redacted]
