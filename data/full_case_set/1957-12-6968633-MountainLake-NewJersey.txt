Dear Sir:

Last night at 7:50 I was standing outside near my house at about 8 feet from the house when I noticed what seemed to be an airplane approaching from the east, making a very rapid approach. It was traveling from east to west at a tremendous speed. As it came closer it seemed to turn into a streak of light, and burned continuously rather than flashing on and off as airplanes usually do. The streak of light continued for several seconds and then disappeared leaving no trace.

Several miles behind this "airplane" I observed a very likely military aircraft approaching. This airplane, which was flying at about the same speed and altitude, seemed to be following the first object's path. I thought this might be a case of retrieval or interception, so that my failure to hear the other plane was just what would be expected, so that my failure to hear the other plane flying in pursuit of the first object was just what would be expected.

I am naturally puzzled, because of my many years of Air Force experience, I see no plausible explanation for what I observed. Are you able to enlighten me in any way on this subject, even if it is only to tell me that you cannot furnish information? Your reply will be greatly appreciated.

Yours very truly,
[Redacted]

P.S. A friend was with me when we both saw this. Neither of us had been drinking!
