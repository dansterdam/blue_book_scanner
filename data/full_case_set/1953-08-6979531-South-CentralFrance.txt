Transcription of the text in the document:

ON 17 AUGUST 1952 AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS SIGHTED OVER SOUTH-CENTRAL FRANCE (APRX 44.75N/0.30E), BY TWO PILOTS OF THE 55TH FIGHTER BOMBER SQUADRON, 20TH FIGHTER BOMBER WING, ON ROUTE TO THE UK FROM GERMANY, ITALY.

PERSONS INTERVIEWED WHO OBSERVED THE OBJECT WERE:

CAPTAIN WALTER G. CARTER, AD 732153
LT LT. THOMAS E. SAUNDERS, AD 1229891

BOTH OBSERVERS ARE CONSIDERED RELIABLE, EXPERIENCED PILOTS.

NO OTHER AIR TRAFFIC WAS KNOWN TO BE IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING.

UNUSUAL WEATHER CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING.

INSPECTION OF FLIGHT CHARTS OF THE LOCATION DISCLOSES SEVERAL RESTRICTED AREAS IN THE VICINITY OF THE SIGHTING. IT IS CONSIDERED LIKELY THAT EXPERIMENTATION DEALING PLANE IN THOSE AREAS MAY HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BY THE TWO PILOTS.

PAGE OF PAGES

On 17 August 1953, we, Captain Walter J. Cotter, AO 7/21633, and 1st Lt. Thomas M. Falvey, AO 1099691, USAF, members of the 28th Air Div., observed a strange aerial phenomenon near the village of St. Saturnin, a few miles north of Clermont-Ferrand, Department of Puy-de-Dôme, South-Central France.

About 19:20Z over the approximate position of 45°43'N-2°50'E (South-Central France), climbing at an altitude of 26,500 feet and exceeding a measured air speed of 230 degrees, we observed an unusual aerial object, bright metallic in appearance, traveling in a southerly direction at an estimated altitude of 45,000 to 50,000 feet above the horizon.

With sky conditions in this area clear and visibility unlimited, the initial sighting was of an bright silvery, spherical object, traveling at a considerably higher altitude than our aircraft. The size was estimated to be approximately 30 feet in diameter. The object was observed for several minutes until it disappeared from view above the horizon.

Because of the unusual appearance and altitude of this object, we altered our flight path for a closer inspection. This change in course permitted us to approach the object for approximately 10 miles. As we neared the object, its speed was estimated at 660 to 725 mph on an approximate heading of 180 degrees. At the minimum distance of 15,000 feet, the object was clearly visible, the shape appearing definitely spherical in configuration, bright metallic in color, and emitting a light of its own, giving off light rays in intermittent bursts of varying intensity.

The total length of observation of the object was approximately 15 minutes, at which time it appeared to have accelerated and disappeared from view at an altitude of 55,000 to 60,000 feet.

Subject: Report of Unidentified Flying Objects

1. On August 6, 1953, a report was received of a sighting of unidentified flying objects over the south-central region of France. The sighting occurred at approximately 9:15 PM local time.

2. The report states that multiple witnesses observed several bright, disc-shaped objects maneuvering in the sky over the region. The objects were said to have performed seemingly impossible maneuvers, including abrupt changes in direction and speed.

3. No physical evidence or photographs were obtained during this incident. This report was filed as part of Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation into unidentified flying object sightings.

4. The map provided shows the general location of the sighting, centered around the area between Paris and the city of Reims in northern France.

5. No further details or conclusions are provided in this limited report. The case remains unresolved within the Project Blue Book records.
