PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP 24/0342Z SEPTEMBER 65
2. LOCATION Bellbrook, Ohio
13. CONCLUSION 4/0
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Sighting lasted from about 1:45 to 2:00 PM, EDST. Objects appeared to be of metallic construction, traveling in a northeasterly direction at a high rate of speed. No discernible lights or markings could be seen on the objects, and they gave the impression of gliding rather than powered flight. Objects were sighted by witnesses on the ground, as well as from an aircraft in the vicinity. Their altitude was estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000 feet. Objects were not visible on radar as reported by the Wright-Patterson AFB Control Tower. Their flight path and apparent speed and maneuverability indicate these objects do not fall within the category of known aircraft.
