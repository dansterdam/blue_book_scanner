The image does not contain any photographs. It consists of two sketches that provide instructions for visualizing and describing the appearance of a UFO sighting.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The text below the second sketch provides additional context, stating that the sketch is supposed to show a view that is "similar to what you saw" and to "complete the larger sketch" based on the smaller sketch example.

U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)

IT WAS 5:15 PM, DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME, OCT. 15TH, 1956, NEAR NEWBURGH, NEW YORK.

SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS OBSERVED A VERY BRIGHT OBJECT ABOUT THE SIZE OF A CAR, HOVERING ABOUT 2000 FT. ABOVE GROUND, 
WHICH SUDDENLY SHOT STRAIGHT UP AND OUT OF SIGHT IN ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE SPEED.

IT WAS A PURE WHITE LIGHT, SEEMINGLY LARGER THAN A STAR, WHICH APPEARED TO BE OVAL IN SHAPE AND HAD NO EXHAUST OR FLAME. 

THE WITNESS, WHO WAS IN A PARKED CAR, STATED HE WAS WATCHING TELEVISION IN HIS CAR WHEN HE NOTICED THE OBJECT THROUGH 
THE WINDSHIELD. HE CALLED HIS WIFE TO LOOK AND THEY BOTH WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES.

THE WITNESS SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE, AND THAT IT WAS UNLIKE ANY CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

NO FURTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

OCR Output:

YOUR LETTER DATED 7 OCTOBER 1956 ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE HAS BEEN REFERRED TO THIS HEADQUARTERS FOR REPLY.

WITH REGARD TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION, A BALLOON CAN BE SEEN AT TWO WIDELY SEPARATED PLACES CONTAINING, OF COURSE, ON ITS PAYLOADS. HOWEVER, OUR INVESTIGATIONS INDICATE THAT THESE CANNOT BE THE SAME BALLOON BUT WERE TWO OTHER BALLOONS RELEASED AT THE SAME TIME FOR THIS BEING THAT BALLOON RELEASES ARE SCHEDULED AT INTERVALS FOR REASONS I CANNOT GO INTO HERE DUE TO SECURITY REASONS.

INASMUCH AS YOUR LETTERS INDICATE YOUR KNOWLEDGE OR WHERE-ABOUTS OF THESE BALLOONS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 6,000 CUBIC FEET AND CAN ONLY RISE TO A MAXIMUM ALTITUDE OF 100,000 FEET, YOUR FURTHER QUESTION WILL BE ANSWERED BY PROVIDING YOU WITH THE FOLLOWING:

CONCERNING YOUR SECOND QUESTION, WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THESE OBJECTS, AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED, COULD CONTAIN, PAYLOADS WHICH COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT. MANY OF OUR OWN SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS USING BALLOONS CARRY PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT, AND APPEARING TO BE UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON TO THE UNAWARE, WOULD BE PERFECTLY NORMAL TO THOSE CONDUSTING THESE EXPERIMENTS.

WE FEEL WHEN PERSONS SUCH AS YOURSELF SEE UNUSUAL EVENTS IN THE SKY, IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT YOU WOULD BE MUCH CONCERNED WITH WHAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE. THE ASSOCIATION OF YOUR DESCRIPTIONS WITH OUR OWN EXPERIMENTS USING BALLOONS FOR SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES WILL, I HOPE, ALLAY FURTHER SPECULATION OR CONCERN ON YOUR PART RESULTING FROM YOUR ORIGINAL OBSERVATION. A LARGE PORTION OF SUCH OBSERVATIONS CAN BE SATISFACTORILY EXPLAINED IN THIS MANNER. YOUR FURTHER INTEREST AND COOPERTION IN THIS MATTER WILL BE APPRECIATED.
