10 November 1957

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

I sighted and photographed an unidentified object at 12:10 A.M. on the morning of Wednesday, November 6, 1957.

I was driving West on Katella Ave. on my way home. As I approached the Santa Ana Freeway overpass, a strange light appeared in the sky ahead of me and it seemed to be moving, I continued up onto the bridge, which crosses over the freeway. As I stopped my car to take a look, I noticed the light had descended and seemed to hover over Disneyland. I turned and advanced the roll of film one frame as a precaution against a closer approach. 

As I continued to observe the object, it seemed to me that it was hovering over Disneyland. It seemed as though it was a very thick circular shaped object. It appeared to be a weird gaseous mass glowing in a vivid pinkish red color and slowly oscillating or pulsating.

Looking across the top of the carand bracing myself between the car and opened door, I located the light in my view finder and snapped the picture. While I was advancing the film, the light suddenly disappeared. I only took one picture of it.

When I got off work that afternoon at 2:00 P.M. I drove to the Garden Grove Motel. I intended to leave the film for regular 24 hour processing. There was only one photographer with the Garden Grove Daily newspaper with me. When I showed him the film, he insisted upon taking the film to have it developed and stated that he would develop the roll free. He took the film with him in his car. When we arrived at the newspaper office, he took us waited in the city room. After the film was processed, he called us in to look at the negative saying, "You didn't get a damn thing!" Upon closer inspection of frame 1, which was quite dense, revealed a small vague image. The photographer conferred with their city editor while the negative was drying.

Statement of Cont'd

Then I enlarged and printed the negative in question. I was amazed and printed the sphere which appeared on the print was not evident to the naked eye at the time I took the picture. The entire image was more defined than my eye had perceived it.

Photographs, for what they are worth, were printed in many papers. At Anaheim, California, 12-year-old * * * was driving homeward in the vicinity of Disneyland when, at 12:10 p.m., he says, he saw a small blimp, pinkish-red in color. It seemed to emerge from view, then reappeared, hovering at a distance. It appeared to be flat, and it made a passing glance. It went out, reappeared and then went out again. About 15 minutes later, the object began ascending. It went out, reappeared and then went out again.
CDC supervisor at Garden Grove, said the had almost continuous sightings of a strange light in about the same spot near Disneyland. It was a large, orange-colored ball, and was reportedly considered by Garden Grove observers.
"I don't know what it was."

II. RELIABILITY: Source was very cooperative and spoke freely. During the interview he seemed to be pleased with the publicity he had received and believed that he had a very important story to tell. The sighting was reported to someone the following day. The complaints did not seem serious or of such nature that they could not be checked.

III. OBJECT'S DESCRIPTION: On 6 November 1957, at approximately 11:00 hours (PST), the witness sighted an aerial object hovering over Disneyland, Anaheim, California. The object was described as being approximately sixty-five (65) degrees above the horizontal and to the northwest, approximately five miles distant. It was in sight for approximately two minutes. The object appeared to be saucer-shaped and was observed through a pair of binoculars. It had the brightness of an automobile taillight and was of a pinkish-red color. It had the brightness of an automobile taillight and was of a pinkish-red color. It had the brightness of an automobile taillight and was of a pinkish-red color.

The witness stated that the object hovered and then moved to the east at a very rapid rate of speed and disappeared from sight. He stated that the object was observed again approximately five (5) minutes later, hovering in about the same position as before. After about thirty (30) seconds, it moved rapidly to the north and disappeared from sight.

The witness stated that the bright spot on the object appeared to be a source of light and resembled a piece of molded glass. He could see no fins, wings or attachments to the object. The witness described the object as cold with a slight mist, slight breeze, and a faint humming sound.

The witness was fairly certain that the object was in sight thirty (30) to forty (40) seconds during the observation. He stated that the object was sighted through eyeglasses.

The witness stated that he had moved his film ahead one frame so that he could re-expose the film at f/5.6 and a shutter speed of 1/30 of a second. He stated that the object he saw could have been a light reflection or some unexplained or unexplainable phenomenon.

A.M. I sighted and photographed an unidentified object at 12:10 on the morning of Wednesday, November 6th, 1957.

I was driving north on the Santa Ana freeway (U.S. 101) on my way home. As I approached the overpass (sic) a strange light appeared on the sky, to the head of me and a little to my right.

It was visible only for a moment as my automobile passed under the overpass. I stepped my car to look for the object (sic) of the light I had just observed. Just then I saw the same light again but it was higher and to the right of the freeway in which I was traveling. 

I stopped my car to look for the object. I noticed (sic) the light for a double exposure. It then opened the car door and as I was getting out to investigate further, the light disappeared. A few moments later the light reappeared. It appeared to be approximately 600 yards away and about 100 feet in the air.

The light shown (sic) like the planet Venus but much brighter. It remained stationary for several minutes when it suddenly went out. A very short time later, approximately 1 or 2 minutes, the light reappeared and this time it was red in color.

The red light hovered for less than a minute and then moved rapidly to the north, making a 90 degree turn and disappearing.

I hurried to my car, restarted the engine and chased the car (sic) myself between the car and open door, I decided (sic) to take my camera on the trip. While I was taking a picture the light disappeared (sic).

I only took my eyes away for a moment - when I looked back it was gone. When I arrived home, I developed the film but it was completely underexposed and I was unable to get any usable photos.

When I got off work that afternoon at 2:00, the light (sic) did not return as I had hoped. I was quite cold and drove on home, thinking I had photographed a strange sort of aerial phenomena.

CONTENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER

1. A positive conclusion as to the cause of the sighting cannot be made, however, an evaluation of possible hoise in sighting. The following observations are the basis for this conclusion:

a. The sodium amber lights of the Santa Ana Freeway, from a distance, have the same general appearance as the object in question, photo graphs during daylight stated that the lights appeared to be those of cars on the freeway.

b. SCURP's photograph has the appearance of a time exposure of night and forth in the photograph, as such, could possibly give the same appearance.

c. From the comments of several citizens of Garden Grove and from those there, including military observations of others, it would appear that the sighting was of ordinary lights on the Santa Ana Freeway, Garden Grove Daily News personnel developed the negative in the newspaper darkroom observed by the G-2.

The image contains a photograph of a "Flying Saucer, by Jingo--or Something?". The photograph shows an oblong-shaped object in the sky, surrounded by a blurred or distorted effect. The caption below the photograph indicates that it was photographed by Edwin G. Laidford of Anaheim, California, who claimed to have photographed a "flying object" that he was unable to identify.

WASHINGTON DAILY NEWS 
2 NOV 1957

Flying Saucer, by Jingo--or Something?

"Head," according to Edwin G. Laidford, of Anaheim, Calif., is an "unidentified flying object" which he photographed it from his car about midnight for the purpose of photographing unidentified flying objects. He said it flickered with a reddish-cast light. Exposure on 21/2 x 31/2 inch film with a 1/50 second focal length lense. Laidford says he does not know what it is. Photo is believed to be upside down. Negative was turned over to the Air Force, which will tell us what it is in 2 or 3 days.

The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a saucer-shaped UFO. The caption below the photograph states that the photo was taken at 12:10 p.m. on November 6, 1957, by a witness whose name is redacted. The object is described as "pinkish-red in color" and "looked like a circular mass" that "appeared to be drifting northwest over Disneyland, California." The document expresses some skepticism about the authenticity of the photograph, stating that it "is probably genuine" but that the witness's "flying saucer" comment "doesn't even believe in flying saucers."

Extracted text from the document:

This photo was taken at 12:10 p.m. on November 6, 1957, by [witness name redacted]. The object, which was pinkish-red in color, looked like a circular mass, and appeared to be drifting northwest over Disneyland, California. The photograph, in our opinion, is probably genuine. However, the witness's comment that "it looked like a flying saucer" doesn't even believe in flying saucers.

There does not appear to be a photograph in this document. The image shows a page from a project blue book UFO report document, containing text describing a "similar 'halo' effect" that was photographed by a member of the ATIC photo branch.

Text transcribed from the document:

AN EXAMPLE OF A SIMILAR "HALO" EFFECT WAS MADE BY A MEMBER OF ATIC PHOTO BRANCH BY PHOTOGRAPHING A STREET LIGHT. ALSO, SIMILAR "TASTY PULP" EFFECT CREATED BY PHOTO OF MOON WITH PROPER CAMERA MOVEMENT. PRINTS OF UFO AND SIMULATED EFFECTS BEING FORWARDED UNDER SEPARATE COVER.

IT IS NOT BELIEVED THAT THE OBJECT IN QUESTION WAS CREATED BY LIGHT REFLECTION FROM CLOUDS OR SKY, BUT BEFORE THE INFERENCE THAT OBJECT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH DISNEYLAND IS RULED OUT, AN INVESTIGATION WILL BE MADE TO SEE IF ANY OF THE RIDES IN DISNEYLAND ARE SIMILAR IN SHAPE TO THE CIGAR SHAPE BECAUSE THRU A TRICK TECHNIQUE A SPACE SHIP IN DISNEYLAND COULD HAVE PROVIDED THE PECULIAR SHAPE.

THE SKY PRODUCED IN THE PHOTOGRAPH GIVES IT AN UNREAL ISTIC APPEARANCE BECAUSE OF THE EXPOSURE RECEIVED BELOW THE OBJECT AND THE FACT THAT IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE NORMAL SKY EXPOSURE, i.e. TOP HALF OF PHOTO IS BLACK, BOTTOM HALF VERY LIGHT. AN EXPOSURE OF 1/10 OF A SECOND AT f/4.5 WHEN CAMERA IS POINTED AT THE SKY WILL REPRODUCE THE STARS UNLESS THERE WAS A CLOUD COVER. ALSO, THIS EXPOSURE WILL NORMALLY NOT PRODUCE AN EXTREMELY DENSE NEGATIVE AS STATED BY SOURCE. ATIC EXPOSED STREET LIGHT AT 1/30 AT f/4.5 AND AT 5 SECONDS, f/3.5. THESE EXPOSURES TEND TO DISPROVE EXPOSURE DATA STATEMENTS MADE BY SOURCE.

IN THE REPORT OF INCIDENT IT IS VERY APPARENT THAT THE SOURCE HAD EITHER A GOOD WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF PHOTOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES OR ACCIDENTALLY USED SETTINGS THAT WOULD REPRODUCE A GENUINE UFO EFFECT.

OBSERVANCES SUBMITTED TO PROJECT BLUE BOOK

Date: November 6, 1957
Location: Anaheim, California
Time: 9:00 PM

The witness was a housewife who had been watching television in her home when she observed a bright flickering light in the sky outside her window. She stepped outside and saw an unidentified flying object descending rapidly, emitting a gray smoke trail. The object hovered briefly before accelerating and disappearing from view. The witness reported the incident to the local police. No other details are provided.

CASE NO. 10C7 - ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA - 6 NOVEMBER 1957

ON 6 NOVEMBER 1957, AT APPROXIMATELY 1935 HOURS, WITNESSES AT DISNEYLAND, ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA OBSERVED A LUMINOUS OBJECT MANEUVERING OVER THE PARK.

THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS ROUND OR DISC-SHAPED, METALLIC IN APPEARANCE, AND APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT WAS LUMINOUS AND EMITTED A BLUISH-WHITE LIGHT. THE OBJECT MOVED IN A "JERKING" FASHION, SOMETIMES STOPPING AND HOVERING, THEN ACCELERATING RAPIDLY, MAKING SHARP TURNS AND MANEUVERS.

SEVERAL EYEWITNESSES WERE INTERVIEWED, INCLUDING DISNEYLAND PARK RANGERS AND SECURITY PERSONNEL. THEY ALL REPORTED ESSENTIALLY THE SAME DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT AND ITS FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS.

The image appears to be a black-and-white photograph or document. It shows a dark, grainy background with a small, indistinct object visible in the center of the frame. The object appears to be a dark shape or blip against the dark background, but its nature is unclear.

The object was observed for a period of 3-5 minutes as it moved across the sky from the southwest to the northeast at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet. The object appeared to be round, dark in color, and approximately the size of a small to medium basketball. No sound was heard from the object. No trail or exhaust was observed. The object appeared to be coasting or gliding through the sky with steady movement.

SOURCES STATEMENT AND UFO PRINT.
A. SOURCE STATED HE TOOK PICTURE OF OBJECT WHILE STEADYING CAMERA ON ROOF OF EARLY 1950 MODEL SIX CYLINDER FORD. ENGINE WAS RUNNING, LIGHTS WERE ON AND THE AUTOMOBILE DOES VIBRATE WHILE RUNNING. THE NEGATIVE WAS DENSE. IT TOOK SEVEN MINUTES OF EXPOSURE TO MAKE THE PRINTS.
D. THE PHOTOGRAPH IN QUESTION IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN COMPOSED OR MADE UP BY SOME SORT OF TRICK TECHNIQUE REQUIRING TWO OR MORE EXPOSURES OR ELSE WAS A TRANSPARENT PLASTIC OR FLORESCENT PAINTED BALLOON OR WAS A COMBINATION OF THE TWO. THE LATTER IS LESS APPARENT DUE TO THE SPOTTING IRREGULAR TONE OF THE CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT ESPECIALLY NOTICEABLE IN FRONT. IT IS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT THE BRIGHT LIGHT WITH HALO EFFECT (TOP REAR OF OBJECT) WAS PHYSICALLY A PART OF THE CIGAR SHAPE BECAUSE ANY LIGHT AS BRIGHT AS THAT ON TOP OF AN OBJECT WOULD HAVE REFLECTED LIGHT FROM THE OBJECTS TOP SURFACE; THEREFORE, IT IS BELIEVED THIS LIGHT WAS MADE BY ANOTHER EXPOSURE.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying object (UFO) reports. The document is a "Joint Messageform" that describes a review and analysis of an Anaheim UFO case, which was passed on to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense and then to the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) on Saturday morning, November 9, 1957. The message indicates that an extensive search by a UFO unit on Saturday morning disclosed no knowledge or receipt of the incident, and that the photos of the incident were shown on both Friday and Saturday nights on nationwide TV hook-up.

SUBJECT: Request for Analysis - UFO Photography
TO: AFCIN-3E3	FROM: AFCIN-4A2F	DATE: 15 NOV 57
COMMENT NR 2

1. In analyzing the attached photograph and report of incident by the source, the following facts are evident from a photographic viewpoint:

a. The photograph in question is believed to have been composed or made up by some technical technique. It does not depict an actual aerial phenomena or a painted balloon or is the combination of the two. The object especially noticeable in the photograph is extremely unlikely that the bright light with it's luminance would have been photographed as a part of the object. It is physically impossible that the light shape because, by light theory, any light so bright as that on top of the object would have reflected by the object and distorted the alleged shape because any light so bright as that on top of the object would have reflected by the object and distorted the alleged shape.

b. It is not believed that the object in question were observed or photographed by light reflection from clouds or sky as concluded by investigators but before the inference that object identified with Disney-land have been concluded out, an investigation should be made to see if any of the rides in Disneyland are similar in shape to the object because of the track technique as space in Disneyland could have video the peculiar shape.

c. The copy reproduced in the photograph gives it an unrealistic appearance because of the exposure received below the object and the fact that it does not look like the normal 8" x 10" as exposures of 5/10 of a second at f/4.5 when exposed directly gives the impression is painted by an artist. Also, the graininess will reproduce the stars unless there was a cloud cover; also, the round shape object (moon) at 5 seconds, f/3.5. These exposures tend to disprove exposure data statements made by source.

d. In the report of incident, it is very apparent that the source had either a good working knowledge of photography or else received very experienced opinions when reporting the details of the technical information. Possible in the first paragraph he stated that he advanced film as precaution against double exposure. After reading the report, the reader is left with the impression that the photographer was attempting to cover all inferences that might lead to the thought of double photography.

e. Also inclosed are copy prints and negative print as requested.
