More & more coming up the Hwy. 10 to 5:28 to 5:30 or there abouts.
At the Simen home & many others, this object turned around & went back almost due west, & back again toward the south, seen about 5-10 minutes by numerous witnesses over the homes, making sharp turns, saw it clearly below tree tops, just about 500 feet alt. 
Then it went up in the air rapidly, & we never saw it again after it reached the tree tops. This happened from about 5:10 to 5:20. The sky was clear & moon was out, which helped a lot to see this object against the sky. As it went up it seemed to get smaller, & disapated somewhat, but not like a burning obj. or shooting star. More like a maneuverable obj. which could be a missile or aircraft, due to it's peculiar movements & speed. I observed it from start to finish thru field glasses which makes this a more reliable sighting, GS-70 or 15 min. This happened alot of people in the area who saw the same thing, but I was the only one who got a good close look & saw it clearly under the tree tops.

This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten report or account describing an observed UFO sighting.

The text of the document is as follows:

"I had to bend forward towards the wheel a bit to get a still better view of the same. It seemed to just sit there without moving for some time. Then it turned on its side and descended very quickly until it was out of sight. The thing seemed to disappear below the horizon very quickly - a blink of an eye and it was gone. The size of the object would compare to a volleyball, and the color was a metallic silver or gray. I am quite certain that the object traveled at an extremely high rate of speed when it turned on its side and descended. It appeared to have been hovering for some time, but when it turned on its side and descended, it left within a second or two. There were no engines, fins, or other appendages visible. The motion was very smooth and silent. There was no sound at all that I could hear. As far as I am concerned, this is the most unusual thing I have ever witnessed. I am quite certain that this was no conventional aircraft, but rather something out of the ordinary. I feel that what I saw was a real and accurate sighting of an unidentified flying object."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely an old report or log from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's UFO investigation program. The text in the document is as follows:

This incident occurred while I was fishing on the Chippewa River. I had noticed a strange light in the sky a few minutes earlier and as I continued to watch, the light became brighter and seemed to be coming in my direction. It suddenly halted and remained stationary for several seconds, then started moving again, zig-zagging back and forth through the sky. At times it would stop and hover motionless, then suddenly dart off in another direction. The light seemed to be oval in shape and was a glowing white-orange color. I watched it for about 10 to 15 minutes as it maneuvered around the sky in an erratic manner, making sharp turns and changes in direction and speed. Finally it disappeared over the horizon. I have no idea what it was. It definitely was not an airplane or any type of conventional aircraft that I'm familiar with. I've never seen anything like it before or since. It was a very strange and puzzling sight.

This image does not appear to contain any photographs. It seems to be a typed document or report from the Project Blue Book investigation of a UFO sighting in Cochrane, Wisconsin on April 4, 1968.

OCR Text Output:

4 Apr 1968
Cochrane, Wisconsin

On 4 Apr 1968 at about 8:15 p.m. CST, the observer and her young son were driving on Route 35 about 18 miles south of Cochrane, Wisconsin when the lights of the car ahead went out. The observer then sighted an orangish-red light ahead which appeared to approach the car. The observer assumed it was the headlights of another car in the distance. The object then reportedly hovered over her car. The engine of her car then reportedly stopped and the lights and radio stopped working also. Particularly the tachometer of the observers car was affected to return to zero or the object then appeared to move away and was observed to return again toward the car and then disappear. The observer stated that the entire incident lasted over 5 minutes.

WEATHER DATA: At 6:00 p.m. CST, the sky was obscured and visibility was 1/2 mile with light drizzle.
At 7:00 p.m. CST, there was 3/4 cloud cover with fog from the surface to the base of clouds and visibility of 1/2 miles.
At 10:00 p.m. CST, it was overcast with fog from the surface to the base of the clouds and visibility was 1 miles.

COMMENTS: Although the observer indicated that she was traveling NE, the map of the area indicated that she was traveling SE. The observer stated in her description that the object was crescent shaped. There was a crescent moon confused the observer into thinking that it was something near rather than the moon. The observer would have had to leave her car to have observed the object as closely as she described it. The fog in the area would have caused a blurring of the outline of the moon and would account for the observer sometimes commenting that the object had clouds around it. Further the observer indicated that there was no moonlight the night of the sighting. However, the phase indicator shows that there was a 3/4 illuminated moon that night. When the object appeared to be hovering over the observer's automobile, she rolled up the vehicle and closed all the doors. It seems to be at this point that the observer began to feel hot. However, the observer stated that she had not felt afraid or panicked at any time, particularly on the feet.

The observer was quite upset during the sighting and states in her testimony that "... I started crying a little bit..." It seems quite possible that in her excitement or fright the engine of her car stalled, thus accounting for the engine stopping. 

The observer was quite interested in the subject of UFOs and had read about them, and when the ran into something that contained her interest, she immediately assumed it was a UFO.

Sub j:	Your Memo of November 22 concerning the UFO report from
	Cochrane, Wisconsin, (3 April 1968)

To:	Hector Quintanilla, Jr., Lt. Colonel

I cannot agree that all pertinent data has been gathered. For example, the comments of the preparing officer stated that "the moon was in its quarter phase that night and moonrise was approximately 2000 hours local time". Moonrise on that day was approximately noon (1) and moonset was just about midnight. Therefore, at the time of sighting, approximately 2015, the moon was still fairly high in the sky. It was not in its first quarter and could not have been mistaken for the object being observed, the bearing of which was approximately 15 degrees toward the northeast. 

Evaluation of this sighting depends largely, as I see it, on the reliability of the conditions under which her observation was made. This point is similar to that reported in many other cases happened. I feel it would be eminently worthwhile to obtain Miss Lichtle's testimony by telephone, and to send you a transcript, so that we can collectively make some judgement as to her objectivity and reliability.

I fail to understand how the preparing officer could have been so fillpreparedly.

To:	Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla

1. I enclose evaluation cards for all four cases requested. I regret that some of these cases are being sent to you unduly late. Reorganization of my office files should prevent this in the future.

2. I regret also, from your standpoint, that all four cases must in my opinion be evaluated as unidentified.  

3. I would rate the one case from July 1968, Omaha, Nebraska, case as the weakest in this category and the one at Cochrane, Wisconsin, the strongest. I obtained a good summary of the Cochrane case, and will send you a copy of the transcription as soon as my secretary can accomplish this.

There is some additional data which I obtained on the Omaha July 1968 case, because I needed to close up some portions of the investigation. This will be sent to you after I obtain an additional transcript which I requested.

TRANSCRIPT OF PHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN HYNEK & MRS. LEITHA

H Hello, is Mrs. there?
L Just a minute. 
H Hello, Mrs. This is Allen Hynek at Northwestern University.
L Oh yes.
H Hi. Do you a minute to talk with me now?
L Yes
H Good. I am quite interested in the sighting that you had back there in April, the third of April I believe it was.
L Yes, it was.
H And several questions that I'd like to ask and I'm not sure whether the best thing to do here is to ask those questions or to ask you to sort of take a deep breath and start over again. First of all, are there any questions you want to ask of me, as to why this is being done, or what sort of thing? Or did I explain enough of that is the better?
L Well, I kind of know that, but the thing that I wondered about is, is it really something or isn't it? You know, because so many people look at you - like the other day there was some distant relation of mine I happened to see him on business, and he wanted to see me - and he looked at me just as much to say, well gee, what's the matter with you. Maybe I don't want to do business with you. You know. And I was just wondering if there is something or if there isn't or..
H Well, of course this is precisely what we're trying to find out. And you might think that after all this time we would know, but we don't.

because you see, people are reluctant to talk, and there are no good photographs, or very, very few, and it's a very tricky subject, and the only way we'll get anyplace is by talking to as many people who have had this experience, and seeing what patterns there are, seeing what things hang together, what things arethe same and what things are different and so forth, and so you really will be helping us if you do this.

Now, there's a few basic points I wanted to check out. You, did you manage to get a compass and did you find out the directions. 

Well, the Highway 35 is where it is and it's Northeast a little bit, goes northeast a bit . .

Well, you see at first the Air Force thought - the Air Force at Wright Field anyway, generally . .

See, that road is so - at times it's north and at times it's northwest and then its northeast on Hiway 35

Yes. Well, basically you were going north. How fast were you traveling? 
Oh gee. See when I was down, maybe about 3 miles below_________ and then a car passed me real fast and it was 65 or 66 Ford, it was tan or tannish colored and it looked like a car that my uncle owns and I though maybe he'd given it to her a grandson and he went by me at a terrific speed and then I dimmed my lights right away them, and I could see, I though I could just one person - of course you would probably just take that for granted, you know - and well then he went on a terrific speed down the highway and I was going about, oh I'd say about 55 - 60. at the time when he passed me, and we went up the highway a ways, maybe 2 miles or so, mile and a half, and then all of a sudden - Mark said to -

Ms. "Mom, look at that red thing," and I looked and all of a sudden I saw the red thing and then this car that was in front of me when the red thing came up between the little and the valley there, it, um, the car just nothing. The lights went out and there was no lights or anything anymore.
H Now these were the lights on which car?
L On the other car. 
H On the other car - shushhhhd.
L The headlights and the taillights went out. And I thought, well isn't that a crazy trick to play on me at this time of night, you know.
So then I kind of started to pull over to the right hand side of road so in case he could be then I wouldn't hit him from the back. Well, when this red thing started, it was above this car in the area, and all of a sudden there was no car there.
H I can't hear you now, is somebody on the line?
L Are you there?
H Hello?
L Yes, are you there?
H Well, there but I somebody must have picked up the phone again.
L No, there's no one down now, he's upstairs now.
H Well, I can hear you reasonably well. Go ahead. Can you hear me?
L I can hear you very little, but I can hear you.
H Well, I don't know whether to try this connection again, or not. Maybe I'd better try to get - let's keep on, maybe it'll get better.
L OK - and I started -
H I'll tell"What - why I don't I get the operator and have them call you.

Connection repaired

H:I don't know what went wrong, but something did. At any rate, where were we? Oh yes, the car in front of you had just stopped and the lights went out.

L:Well, I thought it had stopped because all of a sudden there were no lights, you know, at about the time this thing came above it, and it was in the road, you know. Except it wasn't this object; it was above the telephone posts; I remember that, above that height - 

H:And how far ahead was this other car of you, would you say?

L:Oh, maybe around 4, 5 6 car lengths, that's all.

H:That close. So you must have had to stop pretty fast yourself. 

L:I did. It stopped and then I stopped; I was slowing down all the time and so this thing - you know the other car, after it had passed me, had slowed down to normal speed, and then I pulled over to the side of the road see, or kind of on the side because I didn't want to hit it.

H:But now, did you put your lights out yourself?

L:No, I pulled over to the side of the road and I left my lights on so I could see if anything happened, and then, all of a sudden, my car kept running, and then I watched this thing as it was up in the air above the other car; well, then pretty soon I was watching it, I didn't watch the other car and it may have driven on - or I don't know. See, that's why I won't say what happened to it, because I don't know. But I know when I was watching this, it could have driven off, but it didn't turn on its lights/ if it did. And then Mark and I looked and it came up -

and it was above out car and we looked up underneath the windshield, you know, and we had to bend way down in the front seat to look up under the windshield. And then at that time is when it cut my engine and this and that, on our car.

H: Now, let's go into that in a little more detail, because this is very important. What happened first?

L: Well, let's see. It's been so long ago. I'd have to have that letter back, you know, and I took that it to Mr. [redacted].

H: Yes. I wonder if I have - well I do have part of your letter here I think. It says, [redacted] and I were coming up the highway 35 and 8:20 or thereabouts by the [redacted] house. Car came along and passed us, occupied by one person, a tan metallic color, and so forth and so on. Is that the letter you mean?

L: Yes. You told me to write every detail I could think of.

H: Yes, well, I'll read that very carefully after a bit, but just go ahead and to the best of your recollection, I'll tell you this, well, did you - were conscious at all of stopping your car or did the motor go out entirely by itself?

L: No. I stopped it.

H: You stopped the car?

L: And the car was running.

H: Well, I mean the engine. The engine was still running.

L: Yes, the engine was still running.

H: And then what happened?

L: I was parked over there, I might have had one tail out in the gravel or something, you know, and then this red object came, it hovered, it

came sort of smooth and slow and it passed from up above that other car in the sky and it came above us and that's when we looked down and all of a sudden everything got real still and it got real quite because the car engine stopped, and I think I had the car radio on too, because I usually do, and it, everything went off, just like that.
H How about the lights? How about your car lights?
L Oh gee, there was quite a bit of light at that time so I don't know - I'd have to look back and remember out of my letter that detail - that's kind of small.
H Well, it's very important to know if your lights went out by themselves.
L Well, if they went out, they (you know I'd have to look in my letter) if they went out and I think they did, it was when that happened, because everything cut then.
H Well now, tell me about the - if you had some magic way of putting something up in the sky that closely resembled what you saw, what more-or-less common thing that you have around would you put up there that would most closely resemble it in shape would you say?
L Well, you know those rolls that you buy of Bisquick or Pillsbury and they're in that little tube in your refrigerator case in the store?
H I think I do.
L And you rap that on the side of your counter and I then you get out a triangle shaped of dough and then you roll that up and it looks like a crescent shape, that's what it would look more like.
H I see. Well, I'm not exactly a cook, but I can figure this. Let's see, are you acquainted with Australian boomerangs?
L Australian?

Leithe - 7 
Well, boomerang, you know what a boomerang looked like? 
I've never had one
Would it look anything like that?
It would be like that, similar, except it was more rolled, than to be flat.
Now then, you kept calling it a red color. What shade of red?
I all point, and the best color I can say it would be, is an orangish - reddish color and it looked like, sort of like angel hair that you could see through, and yet it had an orange and red, and it was like an Indian sunset or something color.
I see. Now did it have sharp edges, or did it get fuzzy toward the edges? 
When I looked at it, and what I could get from Mark, too, when it was away from us, then it looked like it was all lines, but it wasn't a distinct line like a pencil mark, but it had, it wasn't foggy, kind of. And yet it had a shape.
Did the shape change?
Well, when it came above us, then we got to see it more clearly, then we looked up directly underneath it, then it had. Before that it didn't, because we could see it an angle.
Did it appear to be a solid object, or did it appear to be mostly light? 
Well, when it came above us, then it was definite, I mean, there was a definite pattern, but it seemed to be more solid, and then toward the edges it was more like that angel hair.
Then, did it ever stand still.
Uh huh, when it was in the air it did. Of course, it was always in the air, but when it stood right above us and I tried to start the car and it ...

I tried and I tried, and as long as that thing was above us I just couldn't get that car to go. It just didn't even want to - it just nothing. It wouldn't even turn over, just grunt a little bit and that was it. And then when it was above the other car it stood still and it seemed like everything was so still at that time, and then it moved off.

H How long did this last? How many seconds?

L At the time I was shocked, I couldn't believe it, that it wasn't some- thing like that and I didn't know what it was going to do. Oh, maybe a minute seems so long then, you know, maybe it was - at the most maybe four minutes. 

H I'll tell you what. Let me try a little experiment here. When I say go pretend the thing has just stopped over your car and the engine has stopped, and then just, even if we are silent for a while here, just relive that, image it's happening, and you don't have to say anything, and then when it goes away, say OK.

L Yes, OK. 

H Alright, go.

L About now.

H It was exactly 61 seconds. So, but when things like this are happening, time seems much longer, so don't worry about that. Alright, then, I wanted to ask if your starter worked when the thing was overhead and the engine wasn't going, did the starter try to turn over or what.

L At this time I was trying to start it see, and it might a little bit longer, because I asked Mark I just wonder what that thing is doing.

and he just didn't want to talk and I thought something was wrong with him so I tried to take care of him too, so it might have been longer than time and I turned it and it went "urp" and then it wouldn't go any more, nothing.  
You mean, what I'm trying to get at, you know how things are when your battery is dead, that is, if you don't have any guess, then the starter turns over, goes zzzzzzzzzzzzzz  
Yes, that's turning over  
Or otherwise, it doesn't go at all. Which did it do in this case?  
Well, I turned the key and it went zzp, and that was all. Then it didn't do anything, it was like a dead battery.  
Well, that's very important to know that. Now, then, when it left, did it go up or sideways, or what.  
No, it didn't go straight up. It went straight over towards, southwest, it went sort of, because it went behind us on my side, and it went over in the field toward a farmhouse there, and it might have gone a little bit, but from where we were it just went straight.  
And now, I'd like to ask whether at any time it passed in front of anything, like a tree, so we could judge how close it got to you.  
See, what I mean. If I asked you just how close was it, well, it's sometime very hard to judge distances unless it's very, very close.  
Well, I think that if I went straight up in the air, it would be maybe as far as a three story apartment building or something like that.
That's how close it was.  
That's how close, huh?  
And then when it came out of - it came down that road -

- page 42 -

Leithe - 10

came down there, right in between that farm there, and it came from 
between the trees and it went between telephone poles, you know, I mean
in front of them but it was above them.  I was coming down the road and
see the telephone poles in front of it.

H Incidentally, are there any power lines - high tension lines - near there?
L Are those high tension lines there, Ralph, or are those just telephone 
lines?  He said he thought they were high tension lines.
H The kind of high tension lines I mean are those, you know, you've seen 
them cross the fields, these high poles with big insulators on them and 
all that.
L No, they don't have any great big insulators on them, cause we've got 
one of those out there.  Anyway, when I was down the highway, see there's 
a mill near Cochrane and that's maybe about 5 floors high, and I could 
see this thing against the mill, and that was a mile up the road.
H OK.  By the way, is Ralph there?
L Yes, he's here.
H After awhile, I would like very much to just say Hello to him.
L OK
H I west to also ask something about the brightness of the light.  Did 
it light up the road, or could you read a newspaper by it?
L If I was standing outside I think I could have, directly under it, except 
it wouldn't have been a light like in the house, it was more of a, like 
a darkroom light, about like that.  It wasn't real light, but you could 
have if you would have stared.
H I see.  In other words, not a brilliant light.  Now after it left, you 
say it went near the farm house.  Did it stop there at the farm house or

Leitha - 11
L          did it go . . . ?
L          No, it went toward that farm house and it was going up the field, you know and it stopped.  It just went real smooth and it didn't hesitate
and it didn't jerk and it went straight over.
H          How long did it take to disappear?
L          It didn't right away.  I finally - then when it left, then the car sort
of jerked.  It turned over it went ur-urur and then finally it turned
over real good and I finally got the car started.
H          That is, you were using the starter?
L          Yes, I was using it.  And it went over there above[ the field, and then
as soon as I got the car started, then it started to come back toward.
me again, like it was teasing me or something, and by that time I had
floored the car and I gotten up to Cochran by the time there and the
high way is lighted, so then it just gradually went back again, and I
saw it crossing the railroad tracks and then I looked down the railroad
tracks toward that field there and it was just going slowly down.
H          You didn't hear any reports from any witnesses, or any other people 
around there?  Of course, people often don't talk about this.  This is
the trouble. 
L          Yes.-- There's a lady in Cochran that saw something like this come from
that same direction one man morning, because I talked to her sister and
I mentioned this about my - you know - and she told me her sister had
seen something but she won't talk to anybody because she said, people'd
figure she was crazy. 
H          Yes.  This is of course a problem I run into time and again, and it's a
rough one.  Now, I also want to know - we haven't talked about sizes.

If you had - why don't you do this right now, even though it looks a little silly, hold your hand straight out in front of you, as far out as you can get it, and your thumb now, straight out (I'm doing it here too). Now if you'd held your thumb up against the light, would your thumbnail have covered it, would your thumb have covered the whole thing?
L    Ex If I held my thumb up against the light, v would my hav
H    Yes, that is, pretend your holding your thumb up toward the light and how much of the light,would it have covered all of it?
L    Oh, see those two ends went back, you know.  It would cover the whole middle part.  
H    I see.  But your whole hand would have covered it?
L    I just have my thumb up.  No, the middle part maybe.  You'd still see the edges.
H    Uh huh.  Let me put it this way.  As you were looking through the windshield at first - you never got out of the car did you?
L    No, I was too scared. My feet and hands were hot. Everything in the car got real hot.
H    Now this is something new that you hadn't told me before.  Tell me about xxxhhxxgaa that now.  Did you, I'll shut up now and you go ahead and tell me.
H    Well, Mark was - you know, Mark saw it first and he was looking at it and I asked him what that is, and he said he didn't know and then he wouldn't talk any more.  He just sat there and looked.  And then, if I remember I started crying a little bit, you know, I said Don't be scared.  Lock all the doors:  And we didn't get out because everything got hot.  It seemed like the inside of the car got hot, the bottoms of our feet.

and our hands started to burn and I could hardly hold onto the wheel
and it seemed like everything in the car got real hot like you were
put in an oven, you know. And it was real stuffy, real hot in there.
and that's about all I know of that. 
Now, when you said you had to look down under the windshield sort of
Yes, I had to put my head up toward the dash and look up in order to
Yes, if you'd had a ruler on the windshield, how many inches do you
think the object would have covered, if you'd had the ruler on the
windshield?
If I'd had the ruler on the windshield?
Yes, how many inches then would the object have measured?
When it was away from us or on top . .
No, when it was quite close.
When it was on top of up it was bigger than the road, from side to side.
I see. That's important to know.
Yes, I think the highway if 18 feet wide there, cause I looked after I
crossed away. Now when you looked, when it was over you then, could you
see anything at all when you looked out the side of the windows, the
side of the car?
You mean, the bushes and things?
No, I mean could you see any part of the object. Was the object big
enough to still cover the sides?
Oh yes. Yes it was.
So - well, if you want to take a guess, and of course this would just be
a guess - but assuming it was this close, how many feet across its
largest part would you say it was? Compare it let's say to a car or

L Oh boy, see there were three sort of like points, but they weren't points you know, like that crescent-shaped roll, you know, and from the two back ones, oh it was maybe - cause see it went over the sides of the road too because when you looked out to seem' and I looked the side windows too, it was maybe about as wide as the road and maybe 3 or 4 feet on each side.
H Now did you, you could just probably fit it into a good size living room?
L No, it would be much bigger than that.
H Much bigger than that.
L It was maybe as big as an FB9, I think. Isn't that - a jet like that. That's about the nearest thing. I was in one of those in Panama one time. That's why I err kind of rememder that size, you know.
H Ok, now you certainly gave me some additional information in that heat because I can tell you now that this is a thing that other people have reported also, you see. Now, did you ever find out who owned the other car?
L No, because I - right away I called the traffic officer that lives in town and I thought it was maybe my cousin with his grandmother's car and I really called her first to find out if * had her car that night and she said No. So then I didn't say anything to her, and so then I called and I reported it to * because I thought that sure was a trick to do to somebody you know, in case he had done something like this, and then he asked me what happened, and I told him.
So then he said, Well you, better call - no he said, I'll have * call you and he said, I'm coming down to get - then he had *.

call me, then he said I had to write down every detail I could possibly remember and that he and __________ would come over and pick it up and that he did that night, I think.

Now, who was this again?
The traffic officer. He's a county Traffic Officer.
Well, he did the right thing. This is fine. That's how it got then to the Air Force.
And then __________ called me that night and then some other man called me from Indianapolis and he told me not to tell anybody anything until I talked to him first and he never called me back and I can't even remember his name or anything, and then a different man called me from Chanute - that was a day or two later, and that one in could verify.
I guess, if I remember right - because he knew him, but he said he never heard of this other one, but they told me not to say anything until they talked to me first.
Well, that's certainly strange. I don't think that could have been from the Air Force. Now, the information I have here is that you are a school teacher there, is that right?
Yes. Not this year though. My mother-in-law was too sick, so I took off a year.
How long - what grade do you teach there? Or grades?
I caught Grades 1 through 3 and then I had first grade.
Uh huh. Keep you busy, didn't they?
Oh yes.
Well, now is ________ within hearing distance. I want

Can you - maybe I'd better ask him what he said, and how he - and then I'd like to ask you a few more questions before we sign off, so if I could talk to- it would be fine.
Hello.
Hello, how are you?
Fine.
This, of course, has been some time now since all this happened, but you probably still remember it pretty well, don't you?
Yes.
What did you think about while the whole thing was happening?
I was just scared. 
Did you say anything, or were you just too scared to talk, or what?
I was just too scared to talk. I just watched it, it just stayed up there.
Did you think that it was going to harm you?
Sort of.
Now, let me see. From the standpoint of color, what color did you think it was?
Reddish-orange.
Reddish-orange also. So you heard your mother talking. Is there anything you'd like to add, or anything that you think could be corrected a little bit.
Let me ask you this, did it get hot in the car?
Yes, it did.
What I really should have asked you, I know it got hot, what I should have asked is how hot. You've been in very hot rooms at school or someplace, how hot - just how hot did it get?

M - Yes, real hot.
H - Was it hot enough though, did it hurt at any time?
M - No, my hands and stuff, my feet. They just got like, burning up. 
H - How about your eyes?
M - They burned a little bit.
H - Alright, well I'll go back to the first thing I asked you, is there anything that you would like to add - well, let me ask you this way. What of the whole thing - the whole thing happening - what impressed you the most? What do you remember most easily?
M - When we stopped the car it got hot, it just stayed up there.
H - Uh huh. What did you think it was, when you first saw it?
M - At first I thought it was a helicopter, but xxxxxxxx I've saw helicopters and airplanes; dothen, and then, all the stuff in the papers of people seeing flying saucers and then I thought it wasn't and I just sat and watched it, cause I wasn't sure.
H - By the way, I should have askedyour mother and I'll ask you. What was the weather like that night?
M - Where we came from all the clouds were ________ you could see the moon, but it
H - What direction was the moon from you?
M - Well, it wasn't -
H - Was the moon in front of you or back of you or what?

quarter that night - I looked it up - and it would have been in back of you, so that's - I was trying to catch you on that one, a little bit. But now, let me see. Somebody said it was foggy that night. Is that right?
M    Not too, not too much. At that time of the year it isn't too much. 
H    Let me see. Could you see the stars?
M    No, one or two by the moon.
H    OK. Alright, then, can I talk to your mother again?
M    OK
H    Thanks very much Mark.
L    Hellow
H    Yes, well, enjoyed talking to _____. He apparently got quite scared.
L    Yes. He didn't say much; in fact when I got home I tried to help him have him help me piece the story together and he couldn't - he just didn't want to talk about anything. He just seemed to huddle up in his bed and that was about it. He was ten at the time.
H    Well, what do you think of this whole experience now, now that a year or so has gone by. 
L    Well, I'll tell you once I got in my house I stayed there and I wouldn't even go outside for a long time at night.
H    Uh huh. Now, what sort of treatment have you had from people that you have talked to about it. Do they - How about at school?
L    Well, my kids of course, are real interested, but I didn't say anything when they told me not to at first, and then after that they were real anxious interested, and after I had had this experience, then came out this Weekly Reader with a UFO in it. They were really interested then.

And some of the school teachers were 
like I was a crack, and my husband said he wished it had been him instead 
of me, and I wished it would have too.

H    Well, I wish it would have been me, because I have never seen anything
like that; I would like to.

L    I'd never want to see one again.

H    You don't, huh?

L    No sir.  Not after that, because I thought it had control of me, and 
when it came above us - you know if you stay in a house at night and 
everything is still, there's still the noises of living, you know, but
when this thing was there, there wasn't even the noise of living.  It
was nothing.  It was an eerie quiet.

H    I see.

L    And then something else I was thinking about.  When it got hot it was so
hot that you're feet and your hands, it was when like when you touch
dry ice.  That's the kind of hot it was.  Real hot like that, but it
seemed like it was in an oven, and yet it was just that hot.  It was
just instant hot.

H    So I' suppose you'd call it a sort of a dry heat.

L    Yes, and at the same time it was stuffy.  Kind of choked in your breathing.

H    Well, is there anything more that you could tell me.  For instance, how
did you feel the next day.  Both physically and mentally?  I mean how did
xxxxxxxxxxxx I don't mean that it affected you mentally, I mean how did
you think about it?

L    Well, every time I went outside I was looking up.  And I guess maybe
inside I felt a kind of jittery and outside I didn't shake or anything, 
but I was still uneasy and I kept looking up and for a while - now it's
almost a year later - but for a while, I though, Gee, if they have
some place on this thing, you know, this spaceship.

that much control they could come and just stop me cold anyplace. You know, it*fs like kind of always wanted to be around people. I didn*t want to be alone.

H Yes, you had a - your car was a fairly recent car, wasn't it?

L Yes, it was a 66 Pontiac Catalina.

H I just looked it up here. Your report said it was a '66 Pontiac.

L It was in tip-top condition, otherwise he wouldn't have let me take it to LaCrosse.

H Well, Gee, I certainly do thank you for this information. It has to go down in the books now as a completely unidentified - because I don't know what it was.

L I don't either.

H And I wish I did. But it fits a pattern, a very definite pattern we've been having from not only this country, but other countries, and sometime I hope we find out what it is.

L I do too.

H Now if anything else happens up in your part of - where is Cochrane by the way? How close to Oshkosh or something?

L This is on the Mississippi River, 65 miles north of La Crosse, we are. But you know, one day - in was in Spring and I was coming home from school, this was way down by the Archery Club, maybe about a mile and a half or two or three out of Winona, and you know, the sun setting - you know - and all of a sudden everything in the road lit up in front of me, and I didn't think anything of it. I thought, this is great! pretty sunset, you know, and I looked over to the west, there was no sunset. And that night in the paper - and I can't remember the day or

anything - that night in the paper and there were people talking about it, then other people in Winona had spotted this flying object too, and they said it had come from across Wabasha over the river you know.
H    That sounds very much to me like a very bright, what we call in astronomy a fireball.
L    Oh
H    And it probably lasted only a few seconds.  That's not a UFO; that we know about.
L    Oh, and then there's - I think it was here, Mrs. - she's from Elmer, she's a school teacher and she did at that time drive down to Fountain City every day which is about 20 miles from where he home is, oh, maybe about 5 or 6 miles above where I saw this thing quite a few mornings she saw a flying object come from in the valleys there and hills, and it came down - and this is early in the morning. She always went to school real early, had to be there I'd say about 7 o'clock, quarter to 7.
H    Do you think you could get her to write me a description of this?
L    I don't know her - that well, but I know other people were talking about it and that she was talking that she had seen it, you know, and I don't whether she would or not, because I haven't talked to her about it, but I know other people told me - this was before I had even, or so, it was right after I had seen mine - then I said something, and they told me, well, she does kind of things.
H    Well, if you can get me any more information on that, I'd appreciate it. 
Now, I think I've taken enough of your time.  You've been very kind and all this, and if I - I would like to think that something will come of

Mrs. 
Route 1
Cochrane, Wis. 54622

Dear Mrs. Lietzau:

In my capacity as scientific consultant to the U. S. Air Force on the matter of unidentified flying objects, I have had occasion to investigate a number of reports that have been submitted to your unit. In doing so, it has become apparent to me that certain aspects of the analysis and assessment that is possible regarding UFO reports can be somewhat confusing or at least not as definitive as possible in certain instances.

Although I have cleared up such details as the exact direction you were moving, the condition of the sky, and the color of the object or objects you saw, the more important factor, I would just like to talk with you to see what you now think of the incident, now that a year has passed. I am also interested in knowing how your account of the sighting was treated by your friends and acquaintances. It appears that in instances where sightings are published, there is often a negative reaction to consider.

I would like to place a call to you some evening during the week of February 24, preferably Wednesday the 26th, or Thursday the 27th. Would either of those dates be convenient for you? I would appreciate an envelope addressed to me to facilitate your reply.

I wish to assure you that no publicity or inconvenience will result from your talking with me since I have made it a practice over many years never to disclose the name of a person who makes a sighting without their specific permission. I hope, therefore, that you will cooperate with me in the interest of science and that any reluctance you may have in fighting with this project will continue to the eventual conclusion of this particular case.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director

1. Dr. Hynek reported this unusual UFO sighting from near Cochrane, Wisconsin. Dr. Hynek feels that this sighting should be carried as an unsolved. We would like to have your views on the sighting before we reach a final decision as to the standard. Our policy regarding UFO illuminations is that we consider the case. The observer was driving US 63 at approximately 0330 and noticed the object over the rural area SE 3.5 miles S-SE 23 c(23) which he described as a large luminous object larger than a star. There was no moonlight. The Buffalo County traffic officer who interviewed the witness after the sighting, stated that the moon was quite bright. Yet it seems unlikely that the moon would appear so orange according to the witness.

Dear Hector:

I am sorry to have been so long in replying to your letter of 14 May, concerning the UFO sighting of April 3, 1968, by a Mrs. Cochrane, Wisconsin. I have been out of the country and, on my return, found myself swamped with so many things that I couldn't really give the report the attention it deserves until now. However, I have read and re-read the report and have some fairly definite ideas, some of which were not mentioned in any of the reports or correspondence. Some of the questions I would like to have had answers will probably be answers will be obtained.

Considerable emphasis is placed at the very beginning on the car passing Mrs. Cochrane at high speed and, apparently, disappearing into the distance. Yet she seems to think it was just ahead. In my opinion her impression of its putting out lights or losing its lights was caused when the car went over a distant rise. It was going at high speed and nothing in her original report indicates that it slowed down because she was afraid she might run into it is perhaps just her own illusion. She does not wear glasses, but I should really like to know what her true correction is.

It is perfectly clear that she did not know what direction she was traveling in. She said northeast, but the map clearly indicates that the direction was northwest. This fact that she was traveling in the wrong direction but thought she was going northeast is perhaps the most significant thing in the whole story.

That the road goes northwest. There may be, of course, some turns that do not show in the map.

Her description of it as a "boomerang" or "crescent" is revealing in itself as a crescent moon relatively low in the western sky. There was also some haze. And she could easily have become confused that it was something near rather than something far in the sky. And this assumption would have led her to conclude that it was rapidly moving, chasing her, and then when she stopped, hovering over her. I think her use of the words "moving again" again and again is revealing, though no one seems to have previously pointed out that this is a word closely associated with flying saucer. There is evidence from some of her testimony that she was interested in the subject of UFO's, had read a lot about them, and when she ran into something that confused her, immediately assumed that it was a UFO. There is no way of checking, but when she stopped the car, looked around, of, of the gas, the car engine simply died. It had nothing whatever to do with the thing above her. I think she so frightened that she killed her own engine by taking her mind off the road. Clearly she was pretty scared and her fright communicated itself to the susceptible fellow who locked the doors and presumably rolled up the windows. It was then that the heater was on and going full. And hence the sensation of heat that she experienced was greatly over-exaggerated. There may, of course, have been a heater or even engine malfunction so that the floorboard of the car felt somewhat hotter than usual.

I don't believe her when she says that she kept cool. The record shows quite the reverse. And her description of additional sensations are not necessarily those experienced by people who are so frightened that they have what is sometimes referred to as a "sinking feeling in their guts." The report indicates that USAF also leaves something to be desired. He says, "I estimate from the observer's report the elevation to be approximately 15 degrees in azimuth. If the object indicated, then the moon could well have been west. The estimated altitude of 15 feet is not inconsistent with the elevation of the moon. The moon was two days out of first quarter and very near maximum part of the declination. Therefore, the horns of the crescent, therefore,

Transcription of the text in the document:

(6) Thunderstorms in area: No official report but I was told there were none at that time.
(7) Vertical temperature gradient: Not available.
1. Any other unusual activity or condition, meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise, that might account for the sighting: None known.
2. Clearance moon and fog in area.
3. Intersection or identification action taken: None.
4. Location, approximate altitude, and general direction of flight of any air traffic or balloon referenced in the area that might possibly account for the sighting: None.

COMMENTS: I received notification of this report on 23 April 1968. She reported practically every detail exactly as we have it here. The only major addition was that she said that on the advice of the local pastor she waited for several days before making the report. The minister advised her to wait until Monday (2 April) to see if more was to appear. She said she had planned to report it immediately, but heeded the minister's caution. A Buffalo County traffic officer was informed. As was the sheriff, 3 April 68, at approximately 0115 hrs. 
I telephoned the witness on 15 May and she essentially confirmed the details. She said the chief witness was an airplane and then a helicopter because it was stationary. At first she thought it was the sheriff coming, but chose to call the sheriff because it was so strange. Her story was still the same.
It appears that there had been a heavy rain prior to the report, and that the moon was also quite bright. In addition, the report indicates that between 15-20 minutes elapsed from the sighting position, a mile across the river, there was a swampy area near the sighting position.
I have two possible explanations: 1) That Mrs. Liedin saw a reflection of the moon on the layer of fog from either the Mississippi River or a swampy area near the sighting position. This possibly is the cause of the sighting.

The driver specifically says that the side windows were down but the object remained visible through the side windows. This would account for the increase in temperature and possibly also contributed to the blurred appearance of the object.

Sorry that I cannot do anything more with the sighting, but I shall be interested in hearing your reaction to my analysis. I think there is absolutely no reason to one that Mrs. [redacted] needs glasses. And I bet two to one that Mr. [redacted] needs glasses.

With best wishes, I am

I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

I do not have an explanation for why the automobile engine stopped and why the lights went out. She insists the ignition key was on all the time. The radio or in the air showed the ignition system was all right. The question of why the person in front of her stopped, according to her report, the same thing must have happened to him.

Unidentified Flying Objects

Colonel Robert C. Kintz
Asst. Director, plans/Operations

Chanute Air Force Base, Illinois

Dear Mr. Kintz:

This is in reply to your request in your letter of 17 April 1968 concerning the sighting of the unidentified flying object in Buffalo County, Wisconsin.

The report was made by a Mrs. Cochrane, Cochrane, Wisconsin, 54622, to a Buffalo County Traffic Officer, H. A. Ziegebein, who also lives in Cochrane, Wisconsin. Mr. Ziegebein received the report at about 8:20 or 8:25 P.M. on April 3, 1960. His station is near where they sighted the object. Mrs. Cochrane and Cochrane, Wisconsin at a point in the road known as then
"passed my home and made the report to me, knowing that I was a Major in the USAF (Res.) and active as District Attorney for Buffalo
County."

I then phoned Mrs. Cochrane and knowing that she was a school teacher, I questioned her in detail as to what she had observed. She estimated that she and her son observed the object for 15 to 20 minutes. She stated that it seemed to be about the size of a car and was bright or luminous but not sharply defined. She said the object hovered about 40-50 feet above the power lines and at times seemed to pulsate. They observed no sound, and there was no trail of any kind.

I have retained a photostatic copy of this and you may, therefore, keep this report.  I am sorry it is not in better penmanship but believe you will be able to read it.

The telephone number of Mrs. Cochrane, in Cochrane, Wisconsin is also given. The witness, her son T. lives with her at the same address. The Buffalo County Traffic Officer, H. A. Ziegebein, may be contacted at telephone number at Cochrane, Wisconsin 16 608-248-2235.

If my office may be of any further help, please call on me.

Very truly yours,
Roger L. Hartman
