Data: Jan. 6, 1957
Longmont, Colorado

Daytime sightings over Longmont, Colorado on January 6, 1957 by Messrs. Carl and Alvin Taylor. The sighting was observed at approximately 1:00 pm, duration 2-3 minutes, several large dark circular objects, appearing to be metallic, operating at a high speed and great height. The objects appeared to be changing direction rapidly and suddenly disappearing from view. The objects were observed by the observers to be metallic and dark in color, circular in shape, operating at a high rate of speed and at a great height, and capable of sudden and erratic maneuvers. No sound was heard and no trail was observed. The observers were impressed by the highly unusual performance capabilities of the objects.
