ATIC-12336
WRO 04-38-3997, 12 October 1950 (N)

Astronomical Astrophysical Observatory
Amherst, Massachusetts
Subject: Unidentified Aerial Object
Bearing: 33 degrees azimuth

1. Witness observed sight of presumed light or star-like object 60 degrees above the horizon (elevation) moving in a circular path against the background of fixed stars. Estimated speed at 12,000 to 15,000 knots between 1244 and 1250 hrs (estimate).

2. The ATIC analysis indicates that the sighting was of a satellite, based on velocity, trajectory, and time of observation.

3. Telescope contact with person who reported the sighting verified that it was an artificial satellite, not an unidentified flying object.

4. This has not as yet been able to pin down the specific satellite concerned, but the identification as a satellite is confirmed.
