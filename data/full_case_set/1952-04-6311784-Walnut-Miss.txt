Transcription of the text:

From: 216th Troop Carrier Wing
Memphis Municipal Airport
Memphis, Tenn.

Report of unidentified flying object by Mr. [redacted], GIL agent, Naval Air Station, Millington, Tenn., reports he and daughter [redacted] lighted Unconventional Flying Object while enroute from Ripley, Miss., to Millington. Observers driving Northeast on Highway 72 about two miles from Walnut, Miss. Object sighted at daybreak on morning of 7 April 1952. Object appeared to be very bright with brilliance of big arc light. Object was many times brighter than aircraft beacon nearby. Traveling too fast to estimate speed. Distance unestimated but object appeared to be smaller than full moon. Object appeared solid. Thinking object was not about to crash, observer stopped, and cut off engine. Observers expected crash but object disappeared behind pine trees. Object made no sound, left no trail or exhaust. 216th Wing Comments: Launched daughter confirmed report. Both sources appear reliable, veracity appears unquestionable to this interviewer.

Report released by INS described "fireball" sighted, Bacon, N.C., about 350 airline miles NNW Memphis early morning 7 April 1952. Considering position of this sighting two objects possibly could have been one and same.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Unidentified Flying Object(s)
Sighting, Tenn.

Date of Information: 7 April 1952
Date of This Report: 7 April 1952

Subject: Julius J. MIEROP, Captain, USAP

Summary:

At 0645 hours 7 April 1952, under VHR subject, a bright light was observed over the Kendrick Hotel, Memphis, Tenn. The object had a "brilliant hazy glow" and was in a hovering position. Although distance was indetermined, observer estimated the object to be approximately one mile distant. The object remained in the same general area for about 5 minutes, then accelerated at a terrific rate and disappeared in a northerly direction.

The weather was clear and warm, and the morning of the sighting was otherwise uneventful. The object made no sound and left no trail. It is the opinion of the observer that this sighting was of an unidentified flying object. The observer is a 38 year old male, has 15 years of air intelligence experience, and is consider by all indications, reliable and responsible.

It is highly probable that this observer sighted some unconventional material object.
