USABILITY OF REPORT: VALID
SPECIFIC:
VALUE: PROBABLY TRUE
FULFILLMENT OF REQUIREMENT: PARTIAL

1. The targets which moved and then became stationary are believed to have resulted from a possible temperature inversion that would justify false echoes on ground targets. However, this report is the first to detail so long an all-borne sighting of pyramids of UF0's, and it is surprising to find the radar operating normally on a target of this type.

2. The fact that 15 targets originally appeared on the PPI scope, but only 2 were observed on the AI radar, tends to substantiate the spurious response theory. Also, it seems probable that the 2 AI targets were part of the original 15 targets. It would be possible for the radar to malfunction during the flight and still check out after the flight but it would be unlikely.

3. There is not sufficient data upon which to make a firm evaluation, and any additional information would be welcomed. This is a very interesting report, well prepared, and the incidents which happened cannot be satisfactorily explained.

This investigation developed the incident, as it evolved in chronological order, from the initial sighting to tho subsequent observations and any information relative t o the object reported. It also records the specific details of the sighting, i.e. number, size, shape, color, speed, direction, duration, etc.
The initiating event was the CPSD radar contact at 2355/14 December 1954. This initial contact was under the control system of the GCA radar station located in the Tokyo area. The object was tracked on this radar for approximately 13 minutes until it passed out of range. The radar scope showed the object to be traveling at a speed approximately 1,230 (ground speed) knots. The object traveled the distance of about 80 miles in the 13 minutes time indicated. It also had a 0-50 which had a signal return from Yokata AB 3,700 feet above the ground. No further amplification of this information was available from the GCA radar crews. Approximate.y 1235 (local time) the Tokyo Radar Traffic Control (hereafter referred to as TRTC) came on watch and immediately picked up the target on their radar. This target was about 15-20 miles northwest of Tokyo proper when picked up by TRTC. The target was tracked until approximately l30l at which time it was at a position about 25 miles north of Tokyo proper, at an approximate altitude of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. It was controlled by TRTC until it passed out of range at about 1301. During this period it was observed to make an abrupt turn to the southwest and back again on several occasions. It was also observed that the target seemed to be alternately tracking southwest and northeast in no apparent pattern or sequence, The TRTC radar crews stated that they had obtained precise plots of the target which indicated the sudden changes in direction and high rate of speed at times. However, they advised that they could not be certain of the distance or altitude between the various plots of the object. It was also stated that the radar had trouble locking onto the target due to the high speed and erratic movement. The target showed on the scope as a single, bright return approximately the same size as a B-29 on radar. No other objects were observed in the vicinity of the target. TRTC was in contact with all aircraft in the area at the time and none were coincident with the target. The target appeared to be completely unrelated to any known air traffic in the area.

At approximately 1300 (local time) a Tokyo Tower Watch Center operator observed what he believed to be an extremely bright light in the vicinity of Mt. Fuji. This was observed from the Tokyo Tower for approximately 10-15 minutes. At times the light seemed to fade and then reappear at about the same position. The light was visible to the naked eye and was described as a very brilliant white light. It appeared to be at a high altitude and its position was in a southwestern direction with respect to Tokyo Tower. During the visual observation, the object was tracked and plotted by the radar at TRTC. The TRTC radar confirmed that the bright light observed was their radar target, which they had been tracking. The TRTC radar operators had visual confirmation of the object through the use of binoculars and they stated that the object appeared to be self-luminous and was not reflecting sunlight. The TRTC radar crews advised that they continued to track the object until approximately 1330 when it faded from their scope, presumably passing out of range. The operators stated that the object showed no signs of engine exhaust or any other visible means of propulsion. Its course was described as erratic with sudden changes in direction and speed. It was reported to have traveled over 100 miles during the time it was under observation. No other aircraft were observed in the vicinity and there were no reports of any other known air traffic in the area during this period. No information was available as to what the object could have been. The report stated that the object was not any type of known aerial vehicle and that "the sighting remains unexplained."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO. ER-21-55
PAGE 3 of 6 PAGES

Lt CASA, ATIO
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS SIGHTED OVER TOKYO, JAPAN ON 15 MARCH 1955.

AT APPROXIMATELY 2300 HRS, 15 MARCH 1955, A VISUAL OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY AN AMERICAN CIVILIAN, XXXXXXXXXXX, AND THREE JAPANESE CIVILIANS, OF AN UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT OVER THE CITY OF TOKYO, JAPAN. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING APPROXIMATELY 200 YARDS IN DIAMETER, LUMINOUS WHITE IN COLOR, AND MOVING AT AN APPROXIMATE SPEED OF 1,000 MPH. IT REMAINED IN SIGHT FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 SECONDS AND THEN DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

SINCE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE SIGHTING, THE WITNESS WAS NOT FULLY CERTAIN OF HIS SIGHTING'S CREDIBILITY, HE DELAYED REPORTING THE INCIDENT UNTIL SEVERAL HOURS LATER WHEN HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE INCIDENT'S VERACITY WAS INCREASED. HOWEVER, HE ALSO STATED THAT HIS VISUAL OBSERVATION WAS SUBSTANTIATED BY TWO JAPANESE CIVILIANS WHO WERE IN HIS COMPANY AT THE TIME. ADDITIONALLY, THIS OBJECT WAS DETECTED ON RADAR BY AN AIR FORCE RADAR INSTALLATION AT TACHIKAWA AIR BASE ON THE SAME DATE AND AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME.

THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED TO MAKE A SLIGHT TURN AND THEN ACCELERATE TO AN ESTIMATED SPEED IN EXCESS OF 1,000 MPH. THE RADAR INSTALLATION ESTIMATED THE OBJECT'S ALTITUDE TO BE BETWEEN 15,000 - 20,000 FEET. IT WAS TRACKED FOR LITTLE OVER A MINUTE. 

IT IS THE CONSIDERED OPINION OF THE LOCAL AIR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER THAT THIS SIGHTING, WHILE UNEXPLAINED, APPEARS TO BE OF A LEGITIMATE AND UNUSUAL NATURE. HE RECOMMENDS THAT IT BE INCLUDED IN INTELLIGENCE FILES FOR FURTHER STUDY AND ANALYSIS.

1. At the 2300 position, the informant reports to the NE was clearly silhouetted against the sky. This mas the same object which was previously reported to have covered a distance of approximately 2 miles in 3 seconds. The informant states that the object appeared to zig-zag in its course and that at times it appeared to be hovering. At one point, the informant reports that the object broke down into a cluster of 4 or 5 smaller objects but that they regrouped and continued on as one object. The object was under observation for approximately 30 minutes, after which time it gradually faded away and disappeared.

2. The technical representative for the possible misorientation of the observed information on the AAT in use can be found.

3. This case compares closely with some recent reports which indicate that pilots of the F-86 had approximately 25 hours total time, while the observers in this case had a total of 12 hours observation time.

4. The pilot's rough estimate of his speed and the time of the actual sighting. For instance a time was approximately 15 minutes for the sightings.

5. As soon as the sighting was on the ground the MGRC of render intelligence assistance was instituted. The decision of the closing was made on the information which was not a record. This condition would have conducted an immediate search operation in which no object was found.

6. The technical representative and the operation of officer of the 32nd Squadron were informed that the sighting was similar to the known system. And it is well, it can now be determined.

16. The information in paragraph 13 of this report is considered for reliability paragraph is qualification a significant reduction in the estimate of the danger of this incident.

17. Enclosures #1 and 2 are attached. This air force release is classified under the provision of AFR 205-1 and is not further classification downgraded or approved for public release.
