Between 14:50Z and 15:00Z, 8 February 1953, two rated pilots of an unidentified aircraft flying at approximately 20,000 feet, altitude, observed a round white light, which was seen to move rapidly at an angle, and a SPIRAL upper air spinning, which was reportedly released at 03 15 53.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

The following report is based on personal interrogation of the source (Captain Robert S. Barnes) and has been reviewed by source for accuracy and completeness.

On the morning of 8 February 1953, Captain Barnes was thawing and heating a C-47 aircraft at the Barter Island air strip, Barter Island, Alaska. Captain Barnes was wearing a fur parka and was standing beside his aircraft which was being readied for a mission. Suddenly, his attention was drawn to a bright object hovering approximately 1,000 feet above the ground and slightly to the west of the strip. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was giving off a very bright light, which illuminated the area under the object. The object hovered for approximately 5 minutes, then started moving rapidly over to the heater located in front of the left wing of the C-47. He immediately realized that the object was not only illuminating the area but was causing a bright glare, washing out the details of the C-47. The object then moved to a position directly over the point which was not being heated, i.e., the tail. The object then rapidly moved from this position directly overhead to a point about 2,000 feet over the building area where it had been hovering initially. 

The color of the light was similar to that of white hot metal except that it did not appear to illuminate the area and only seemed to be glowing or shimmering when it blinked out. He described it as a cold but brilliant light.

Captain Barnes estimated the size as smaller than a C-47 or approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. Captain Barnes reports that this estimate was based on the fact that the object maintained a fixed relation to the C-47 and the fact that the object passed directly overhead.

The object seemed to be affected by the wind as it hovered at 2,000 feet, and Captain Barnes estimated its speed to be controlled craft. As it moved against the wind to near its original position, the object moved about 500 feet.

The sound emanating from the object was described as not loud but a deep, heavy sound such as large congregated motors would make while operating.

After hovering for approximately 45 seconds, the object began to climb out using a pulsing or fluttering type of motion. The climb was not at a high rate of speed, and the vertical movement was greater than the lateral movement. As it climbed, the object blinked regularly at about one minute intervals.

During the climb-out, 1st Lieutenant Lewis E. Griffin was driving a vehicle from the building toward the object for Lieutenant Griffin. At this time, the object was directly overhead. Lieutenant Griffin estimated the object to be 10,000 to 12,000 feet in altitude and estimated its diameter to be approximately 30 to 40 feet.

Three minutes (fast). Captain Barnes did not note the time of disappearance. The two observers continued to watch the light for approximately two more minutes, as it travelled Easterly blinking as it went and disappeared in the distance. As it ascended the object seemed to pick up speed and became somewhat smaller and soon on an erane.
Captain Barnes is an F-94 jet pilot with 9 years service and 1.470 hours of flying time. He has been stationed in Alaska since March 1950. Captain Barnes has been and remains an outstanding fighter pilot. There have, however, been no known similar sightings by Captain Barnes or any members of his flight. He has never seen anything similar to the object reported herein.
Lieutenant Griffin is a pilot with approximately 1,100 hours flying time. He has been on active duty for 10 years and is presently stationed at Eielson AFB, Alaska. He has been on active duty for over 5 years since graduating from pilot training.
The following weather sequences were reported from Earter Island at the times indicated:
08/1302Z 5000! scattered, visibility 7 miles, very light snow, wind SE 9 Knots, temperature -=-29 dew point -.37
08/1532Z 5000! scattered, visibility 7 miles, very light snow, wind 3M 8 Knots, temperature -32 dew point -42
Following are winds aloft from the 08/1500Z sounding:
10,000! 170
15,000 230 37 Knots
17,0001 220 30 Knots
The following information regarding the 08/1602Z weather balloon release was supplied by the Earter Island Weather Detachment:
a. Exact time of release of 8 February 1953 balloon was 1915 GMT plus or minus 5 minutes.
b. The balloon was DIAK, with a free lift of 600 grams. 
c. The balloon was lifted and tracked by the station.
d. The balloon was lost from tracking at an altitude of approximately 49,000 feet after rising through very light and variable winds, the wind direction swung thru 360 degrees between surface and 49,000 feet level.
e. The complete code of data of winds aloft for this observation is as follows:

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
1. Although the time of sighting and time of movement, course of travel and ascension rate agree with the report, the possibility that the sound reported was a coincidence rather than caused by the object that was sounding is raised. It is considered likely that the exact time of release as reported by the Barter Island Weather Detachment may possibly be the time that the sound started.
2. In regard to the sound reported, Captain Barnes agrees to the possibility that, due to his initial surprise at seeing a strange light, he may have jumped to conclusions in associating the sound with the light.
3. Captain Barnes feels sure that the object was descending when he first noticed it. However, the possibility exists that an illusion of descent may have been created by the light variable surface winds and the resultant changes in direction of travel.
4. The falling-leaf pattern and blinking of the light could have been caused by the oscillations normally associated with PEAL released.
5. Considering all factors, it is the opinion of the preparing officer that the object sighted was probably the light from the PICAL sounding. The observers indicated the proximity of the light would witness certain release from Merrill Field as a PICAL event.
6. It is felt that the importance of this report lies in the fact that a qualified air observer may have mistaken the light on a PICAL for an unconventional flying object.

The text found in the document is as follows:

Barter Island, Alaska
8 February 1953

I. Description of Incident
Two pilots on this station made a ground-visual observation of an unidentified aerial object coming in over their base in a falling leaf pattern from the west. This of the observation was 0250 J.C.T. It traveled; consisted of brilliant orange white lights seen for a period of eight minutes after which the object disappeared. Thoughts is gave off a pulsing light of an approximate size of C-47 aircraft.

II. Discussion of Incident
This report is based on the investigation made by the writer. While the line of sighting is believed to be possible, however, that the above-average sources may have to be based on additional information on helicopter traffic which AEFC has requested.

III. Conclusion
Insufficient data.
