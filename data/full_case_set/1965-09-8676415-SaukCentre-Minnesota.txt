Dear Mr. [REDACTED],
Please refer to the delay in replying to your letter regarding your unidentified flying object sighting. The volume of UFO reports received at this time requires a considerable amount of time for investigation and reply. 
Your sighting of September 11, 1966 has characteristics of aircraft observed by several witnesses. However, because of the limited information contained in the report, it is difficult to make a conclusive determination. As discussed with you on the telephone, the object would appear to be a normal aircraft. The fact that the object was at a very high altitude may account for the difficulty in identifying it at the time of the sighting.
Thank you for your interest in our program; I regret that it took us so long to reply.
Sincerely,
GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.

TO: Hq USAF SAFOIDG (Mrs. Hunt)

REFERENCE the attached letter from Sgt. Atch, USAF, a resident of Sauk Centre, Minnesota. The following ia suggested reply:

Dear Mrs. Hunt:

1. Your sighting of 11 September 1965 has characteristics of an aircraft observation. However, it is impossible to check the military traffic at that time to determine positively your identification. Your description of the blinking light and disappearance of the object is consistent with an aircraft at high altitude. An aircraft at high altitude often appears to disappear when reflecting surface of the aircraft becomes invisible as it banks away from the observer. The fact that it was not seen to land is explained by the fact that the aircraft was at a very high altitude.

Sir:

First, let me say that I am not writing this because of all the sightings of UFO's that have been reported but only because I feel this is a matter that I would like to state just what I saw--without any doubts whatever.

On September 8, 1965, I was doing some repair work on my car here in Sauk Centre, Minnesota. About 8:30 p.m., I went out to get a part from the hardware store. As I went back into my garage, I noticed a strange object hovering in the sky over the Sauk Centre water tower. I called to my son and he also saw the object. It was round, and had a blue glow around it. It seemed to be about 500 feet from the ground. The size I would estimate to be about 75 to 100 feet in diameter. It made no sound and it just hovered there for about two minutes and then suddenly shot straight up very high out of sight. It made no noise and it disappeared immediately. The other man who saw it with me was a neighbor who came out to see what I was looking at. He was just as amazed as I was. This is exactly what I saw. I have good glasses and my eyes are excellent for at my age (65). I would appreciate hearing from anyone who can explain this. If there were any plans in the area and in trouble we should know about it.

Very truly yours,

[Signature redacted]

Sirs, I am sorry that I am not writing this because of all the exciting sightings of flying objects that have taken place only because it disturbs me no end to have to do it. I wonder if there is any way to prove just what I saw without any fear of ridicule.

I live in Sauk Centre, Minnesota. I would like to state just what I saw without any further comments. On the west and of town, I drove out to the west side of town to see if there was anything at the new road construction. I saw a large object hovering above the ground about 150 feet up. It was circular in shape and about 75 to 100 feet in diameter. It had a large light on the bottom which was brightly lit and seemed to be changing colors, white, green and red. There was no sound coming from it. I watched it for about 15 minutes from a distance of 500 feet or more. There were no other planes in the sky. I had a pair of 7x50 binoculars with me and I could see the object very clearly. Suddenly it disappeared immediately and the other one was in sight for only a few seconds. I rushed back to town thinking there must be some explanation, but I could find none. A few weeks later I was at the local airport to see if there were any planes in the area and to trouble me more, there were no planes in the area and nothing that could be moving like the object I had seen before.

I am puzzled and worried about this experience and I would like to know if there is any way it can be explained without being ridiculed. I am a sane, intelligent person, 43 years of age and I know what I saw. There is no doubt about it in my mind. Would appreciate hearing from you.

Very truly yours,
[Redacted]

TDEM/UFO
UFO SIGHTING, 11 SEPTEMBER 1965

HQ USAF SAFOICC (Mrs. Hunt)
This refers to the attached letter fr requesting information on unidentified flying objects. The following is a copy of the letter:

a. Dear Mrs. Hunt:
Your letter of 11 September 1965 has come to my attention due to the interesting and unusual nature of the sighting it describes. The information and description of the two objects appear to be very close to aircraft and they would require explanation. The sun's glint produced the impression that the objects were motionless, when in fact they were moving away from the observing point and would no longer reflected the sun's light toward you. The fact that there was more than one object simultaneously observed is very unusual and raises questions requiring explanation.
