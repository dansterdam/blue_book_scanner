PROJECT BLUE BOOK
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
DATE: 6 SEPTEMBER 1962
LOCATION: NEWARK, OHIO
REPORT NO.: 8114

On the night of 6 September 1962, a man in Newark, Ohio reported seeing a bright, rapidly moving object in the sky. The object was described as round, with a glowing red light, and moved silently at a high rate of speed. The witness was unable to determine the size or distance of the object due to the poor lighting conditions.

The witness reported the incident to the local police, who in turn notified the Air Force. An investigation was launched, and the object was determined to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). A physical trace was found at the reported location, which was collected and sent to the Air Force for analysis.

The analysis of the trace evidence revealed that it was a small, irregularly shaped rock or meteorite sample. No further information or conclusions were provided in the report.
