There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned document from the Project Blue Book archive, containing a report about a sighting of unidentified aerial phenomena near Congaree AFB and Shaw AFB in South Carolina on March 3, 1953.

The text from the document is as follows:

On March 3, 1953 about 1715 hours, 1st/Sgt. Dunlap and Airman Foley were in the ball turret on a B-36 bomber at Congaree AFB, South Carolina, stating that he had received word from Captain Harrington, Radar Operations, that Captain Harrington had seen three objects at Alta, South Carolina. Captain Harrington was trying to get a plane to intercept at Shaw AFB, but had been unable to do so. He stated that Captain Harrington was trying to get a plane to intercept these objects as he wanted to see if the objects would enable a radar lock on. He also stated that they would have to contact the pilot of the Air Defense Command to handle the situation. They were unable to get a plane to fly on an intercept as the pilot on the aircraft had to get back to Shaw AFB. They informed him that they would have a pilot on standby later that night to fly if the objects reappeared. At 1725 hours, Major Ballew from Congaree AFB called in for a veteran radar operator at Congaree to monitor the situation. They reported the objects to be located somewhere between Congaree and Shaw AFB, traveling in a westerly direction. The veteran radar operator reported locking on to the objects and stated that they were traveling at an estimated speed of 600-700 miles per hour. At 1730 hours, Captain Harrington again called Congaree and stated that the objects had been observed by his crew and him visually at Alta, South Carolina. The report stated that the objects were triangular in shape, with three lights on each point of the triangle, and they were observed to execute vertical and horizontal maneuvers. The report further indicated that AF 401 was unable to get a plane airborne to intercept the objects and that the radar operators at Congaree were unable to obtain a positive radar lock on the objects. The report concluded with the statement that the sighting was classified as unidentified.

In compliance with paragraph 7a, Air Force Letter 200-5, the following information is submitted:

1. The object was sighted at 1825 hours, 26 March 1953, approximately 30 miles north of Congaree AFB on a heading of 300 degrees.

2. No other aircraft or ground installation was observed in the vicinity at the time.

3. The object was described as a light circular shape with variable color, initially bright white but changing to orange and then red during the observation. The object was estimated to be approximately 50 to 60 feet in diameter. It was observed for a period of approximately 30 seconds.

4. No sound or trail was observed emanating from the object.

5. The sighting was made by two pilots who were on duty. These airmen are rated excellent in regard to reliability, experience, and powers of observation. They were on a routine Operational Readiness flight at the time of the sighting.

6. The weather conditions were as follows:
(1) Charlotte, N.C. - Thin broken clouds at 25,000', 15 K. Vis.
(2) Columbia, S.C. - Thin broken clouds at 18,000', 15 K. Vis.
(3) Augusta, Ga. - Thin broken clouds at 20,000', 15 K. Vis.

The radar operator was scanning the area at the time of the sighting but no target indication was observed.

This report is being submitted to higher headquarters for further analysis and inter-action without concurrence.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

STATEMENT

At 1655 5 March 1953, I received a call from Captain Warrington, Commanding Officer, 727th Tactical Control Group, Shaw AFB, South Carolina. He said to put a ground radar back on the air and copy 577 so objects on same. At 1705 radar was back on the air and we had the target over restricted area.

From the call from Captain Warrington just came in, I immediately answered that orders for a control to immediate send any officers or radar personnel MCO's were available. As approximately 1715 S/Sgt John Harnage and S/Sgt Briggs had arrived to give assistance. At that time we pick up approximately 7 plots on the unknown objects. The initial plot was 215252. The object was moving towards Congaree. When the object passed within 11 miles of Congaree, the object made a sharp turn to the north of base. The object then faded at 360Â° 20 miles at 1723.

I took over the job of keeping the log and causing continuous investigation while S/Sgt Harnage and Briggs worked with A/C sent to investigate.

Transcription of the text in the document:

AT 1715 HOURS, 5 MARCH 1953, 1ST LT. JOHN TAYLER, WAS IN THE BASE OPERATIONS AT CONGAREE AFB, SOUTH CAROLINA AND NOTICED AN OBJECT ON THE BASE RADAR SCOPE AND THE RESTRICTED AREA. LT TAYLER AND HIS RADAR OPERATOR WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND PROCEEDED TO CONTACT THE RADAR SITE AT SHAW AFB, SOUTH CAROLINA. THE OBJECT WAS FLYING AT AN ALTITUDE OF 55,000 FEET FROM EAST TO WEST. THE RADAR OPERATORS AT SHAW AFB CONFIRMED THEY ALSO HAD THE OBJECT ON THEIR RADAR SCREENS. THE OBJECT WAS FLYING NORTH AND WHEN DIRECTLY OVERHEAD, IT STOPPED AND HOVERED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. THEN IT PROCEEDED TO MOVE AWAY AND DISAPPEARED FROM THE RADAR SCREENS. LT TAYLER AND HIS OPERATOR WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF AIRCRAFT IT COULD BE USED FOR INTERCEPTIONS.

LT KELLEY TOLD ME THAT A F-51 NATIONAL GUARD A/C AND A/C 4522 WOULD BE SCRAMBLED TO INTERCEPT THE OBJECT. THE F-51 WAS ONLY ABLE TO REACH AN ALTITUDE OF 35,000 FEET AND THE A/C 4522 WAS UNABLE TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT. THE PILOTS REPORTED THEY HAD TO BREAK OFF DUE TO LACK OF FUEL AND THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED FROM RADAR.

Dear First Lieutenant:

Thank you for your letter and comments. I too think that we are getting some genuinely interesting data on various types of unidentified flying objects. The truly unknown cases with their peculiar behavior are of course principal interest. We should in time be able to separate the wheat from the chaff as unimportant or natural phenomena are more definitely identified and eliminated.

We should in time be able to set up some important tests to demonstrate these phenomena with their real properties. This can only be done by selecting proper cases and having the necessary cooperation of those who are in contact with the actual occurrences. 

I note that you will continue with your work and that we can have occasional meetings.

Well, here, we are on this watch of 16 March. Of the 12 cases in this report, Bacon, J. has a few that are distinctly different. Two show a rise and sudden disappearance and reporting to the same instant. One shows the Venua case as nearly so (Second Centralia). And the rest of the cases seem most probable to have been some natural phenomenon such as St. Elmo's fire, and 7 March seem most probable to have been some unusual natural phenomenon at Shaw AFB.

I am sending you a copy of this report. As you may be interested in some of the more important cases, the most important at present seem to be the data and reports from Congaree AFB and Shaw AFB on the night of 7 March.

I will be looking forward to our next meeting.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

TEXT OUTPUT:

29 MAR 1953

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

1. On 27 March 1953, at approximately 1610 hours, two citizens of Congaree, South Carolina, reported sighting unidentified flying objects in the sky over Congaree Air Force Base and Shaw Air Force Base.

2. The two citizens stated that they observed three round, white objects at an estimated altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. The objects were observed for about 20 minutes, moving in an erratic manner and disappearing and reappearing several times.

3. A check with Congaree Air Force Base and Shaw Air Force Base revealed that there were no known aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.

4. This case is being submitted for your information and evaluation.

Dear First Lieutenant:

Thank you for your letter and comments. I am think that you are getting somewhat baffled with this system of ours. I have made a rather careful search and analysis of the truly unknown cases with their follow-up so that a true scientific evaluation can follow up on critical points of the data. I want to go to the other extreme and make a much more complete analysis of thse cases, so that I can convince myself that little outstanding values can be eliminated. We should be able to set up some experiments to demonstrate these phenomena as well as we can do with other things, and this can come only to existing phenomena. 

I hope that you will continue with this work and that we can have a successful attack on this watch of 16 March. Of the 12 cases in this watch, 8 were within the USAF and 4 were in USAF reserves. The have the following up to the same incidents seem to be worth definite attention: On 7 March there were 8 sightings, and 12 those of 6 British reports. On 9 March there were 7 watch again seem to have been down. 

Now as to Shaw AFB, I am sure you are of some interest, the most important is of watch, as perhaps we have had some 200 sph and still have been unable to get confirmation of a few minutes on any of the following: a) Aircraft of unknown configuration taking off or landing at Shaw AFB but seen for only a few minutes, b) Two unidentified objects over Shaw AFB APB a few hours later refer to the same thing. 

We are naturally interested that the object could have been 30 feet or more in diameter, but information is still too scanty to come to firm conclusions on the actual size, shape, speed, etc. of the phenomena. Have you received any other reports on this case?

I. DESCRIPTION
At 1245 EST, the Assistant Director of Security at the Savannah River Project observed a silver, saucer-shaped object visually from the ground for a period of 2-3 minutes. This object was at a very high altitude, and very little intrinsic motion was observed through interrogation of the object.

A detachment of the 73rd Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron at Congaree, South Carolina, was notified as a result of the above visual sighting. They picked up this object on radar at 1507 EST that the same day, and tracked it to the northeast. This radar contact was reported to the Air Force officials and a pursuit aircraft was dispatched in an attempt to intercept the object. The pursuit aircraft was airborne within 10 minutes, but the object had disappeared from the radar screen. The F-86 returned to its base.

II. DISCUSSION
A check was made to determine if there were any aircraft in the vicinity with the Assistant Director of Security. There is practically an ALL time an hour between ALL three military installations (Congaree, A.F. Savannah River Project, Shaw A.F.B.). There was one aircraft on the ground at Congaree that morning, a T-33 from Shaw A.F.B., but there is really not enough information contained in the report concerning its flight activities. For the observer to have seen an object that long a period, it would have to be traveling at a very slow speed. Information gathered indicates that the object tracked on radar, and the object observed visually, were considered to be one and the same.

This information was sent to the Intelligence Branch of ATIC for analysis. This branch, after carefully reviewing the reports, evaluated it as possibly coincidental and not necessarily related.
