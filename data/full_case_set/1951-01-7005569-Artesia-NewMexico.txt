UNCLASSIFIED

Following is a report of the sighting by the undersigned of an unidentified aerial object in the vicinity of Artesia, New Mexico, on the evening of 17 January 1951.

At approximately 10:10 while driving southbound on the highway approaching the intersection of routes 82 and 285, approximately 12 miles north of Artesia, New Mexico, I [redacted] and [redacted] observed in the sky in the east-northeast direction a bright light, very brilliant in nature. The light appeared to be oval or circular in shape and was relatively large in size, approximately the apparent size of a half dollar held at arm's length. The object was observed for a period of approximately 2-3 minutes. During the time it was under observation the object did not appear to be moving. Suddenly, it disappeared completely. This disappearance was not gradual as might be expected of an aircraft or other conventional aerial vehicle, but rather instantaneous, as though the object had been extinguished or had moved out of sight with tremendous speed.

As approximately 1630 while driving northbound on the highway, [redacted] and I again observed a bright light in the east-northeast, similar in appearance to the one previously described. This time, however, the object was observed for only a short period, approximately 30 seconds, before it disappeared just as suddenly as on the previous occasion.

The observation was reported to the nearest Air Force installation, and it is believed that the object sighted was probably some type of experimental aircraft or guided missile, the possibility of which cannot be entirely ruled out. However, the tremendous speed and instantaneous disappearance would tend to make this doubtful. The possibility of the object being a satellite or similar astronomical phenomena is also considered unlikely due to the intense brilliance and the fact that it was observed on two separate occasions within a relatively short period of time.

The observation was recorded by [redacted] for subsequent investigation by authorities concerned. It is requested that this report be treated as UNCLASSIFIED.

On 11 January 1951 an unidentified aerial object was sighted by five (5) persons while driving in the Cottonwood, New Mexico area. At the time of the observation, the object appeared to be round, white, and luminous. It was stationary for approximately 20 minutes, at an altitude of 2000 to 4000 feet. Two cylinders which appeared to be smoke trails were observed trailing from the object. When the object began to move, it traveled at a high rate of speed and in a straight line. Five (5) civilian employees of the NMA Division, Holloman AFB, New Mexico confirmed this observation. At the time of the observation, no weather balloons were known to be afloat in the vicinity of the controlled area. It is believed that no weather balloons were aloft at the above time.

Telephone, the weather bulletin furnished by the U. S. Weather Bureau, Knoxville, Tennessee, indicates visibility on the day of observation was "excellent" at 1500 hours. Based on flight testimony, this object was observed for 25 to 30 minutes, whereas State Police witnessed the object for 15 to 20 minutes.

As further incidents of this type are reported, Additional information will be forwarded.
