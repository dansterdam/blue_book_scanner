LOI example XXX.

U. S. WEATHER BUREAU OF ANNOUNCEMENT OF SCIENTIFIC ATTACHE

White Sands Proving Grounds, ..., New Mex-

“Flying saucers” seen in Britain throughout France, Italy, ‘Belgium,..., 
and Egypt by hundreds of observers in 1947, continue to cause speculation
in the press.

Military authorities deny that any such apparatus was built or could be built
and suggest either mass hypnotism or a very real, 
albeit laugh-off-able, scientific fact.

As all Americans, it puzzled me to a great extent after reading 
an article "Saucers don’t laugh it off" by ..., who from 1940 to 1945, was
with the British R.A.F. in scientific work, and trying to do a quite 
reticulated evaluation of the elements that might figure in the controversy.

Regardless of conjecture - That fact remains - the mysterious “saucer” was
particularly well demonstrated during my twelve months tenure at the command
of White Sands Proving Ground in technical and scientific evaluation 
group in the Spring of 194..., traveling at a speed approx. of 
three to four miles a second!

One afternoon last May, for instance, a highly polished, pear shaped object
approximately thirty feet across and fifty feet in overall length, and traveling
about twelve miles high calculated an engineer after having been followed
by a photo theodolite atop a mountain top for 60 seconds until it was over 
the general area of Alamogordo and vanished as suddenly as it appeared! 
Three to four miles a second!

Air observers at first thought they saw a conventional fighter aircraft
but on examining their street pictures of the apparatus with an unbiased "eye"
discovered the mystery ship to be a saucer shaped and manned by at least
3 occupants..., traveling up to 12 and 15 miles in altitude and converted
“sunbeam” for a propulsion element.

Contained..., short - line all-azimuth technical projected saucer; object
that 25 times assumed a nose end was traveling at a course of a "V-2 test,
located in a 20-power elevation telescope, an instrument that can follow
a missile to altitudes of 100 miles or more.

It isn’t known what it was, but I had never seen anything like it before,"
he told me. “It seemed to be metallic, but I couldn't tell its size, its
speed or its altitude. It would be impossible unless you knew one of the
three factors."

He added he had informed his superiors of the incident and was told the 
next morning he had seen a "disk".

probably a weather balloon," but one informed the enlisted technician is 
considered "highly" UNCLASSIFIED

U.S. Officers
Report Seeing
Flying Disks

BY MARVIN MILES
WHITE SANDS PROV-
ING GROUND, N.M., Aug.
29—Flying saucers—or at
least mysterious flying "ob-
jects"—have been sighted by
several personnel at this vital
center of America's upper air
research.

I talked with three men,
senior officers and an enlisted
technician who reported seeing
strange objects in the sky during
recovery a la high Frisbee, or as
requisition for a high-altitude
invisible airc.

Men in flash, these missile had
pointed out that other officers,
and engineers at White Sands
accept the reports and put them
down to imagination, weather,
hall-o'ween, dual images in high-
powered optical equipment, or
possibly distant planes reflecting
sunlight.

Xeresienceed Observers
Yet the men who gave their
words presumably are famili-
par with such posssible as sour-
ces of balloons and planes as
quixotic result of star-
shooled juntas in the sky if

One officer believes, sincerely,
that the objects seen are a basic

tion throw a high-photo there.
show the "object" was 35 to 40
miles high—a "fizgig" approach-
ing of fantastic speed and travel-
ing for a missile a speed of three
to lout incredible seconds!

The observer in this case nto
sad, was tracking a balloon, jhet
the upper air when the object
bowed across the balloon's path
and averted for some 10 seconds
flocking gravity up to 22 times the
force of turn before it undap-
peared. It had no visible means of
propulsion.

Technicians Report
The enlisted technician report-
ed seeing an "object at 3:35 p.m.
the afternoon of a yet was tracking

in a 20-power elevation telescope.
an instrument that can follow
missile to altitudes of 100 miles
or more.

"I don't know what it was, but
I had've never seen anything like it
before," he told me, "It seemed to

size, its speed or its altitude.

He added he had informed his
superiors of the incident and was
told "the next morning the had seen
a disk."

'Weather Balloon?
A check of one officer elicited
the response: "It was probably a
'weather balloon," but the descri-
ed "the mill technicum is con-
ered a "reliable man."

First Rule's: object seen
by a senior officer shortly after 11
a.m. and reported to the airport com-
mander. The Observer was prepar-
ing for a missile firing and scan-
ning the skies through binoculars.
"I don't know what it was, but it
came out of the north and a south

wouldn't guess at speed or size."

He hesitated to explain the 'sauc-

The document contains hand-drawn illustrations, not photographs. There are two drawings present:

1. The top drawing depicts an arc with angles marked, indicating the movement of an object in the sky, with annotations "A.B." and "A.B." at different points of its trajectory. The arc is annotated with angles in degrees, showing the position of the object at various times.

2. The second drawing, below the first, depicts the trajectory of an object with an "X" marked at the beginning of the path and a circle marked at the end of the path, with annotations indicating the direction of movement with arrows. It is labeled "A" at the start, "B" in the middle, and "C" at the end, with "Down" and "Fast Turns" written alongside the path.

     afterward we heard many reports.
