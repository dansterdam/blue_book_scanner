Gentlemen:

Enclosed for your file and possible distribution to SAFOI and other interested organizations are two reports:
1) Ann, Mass. (8/2/67) again sighting (See Ann detailed report to NICAP)
2) Waldwick, N.J. (8/3/67) sighting. (See attached report to send the complete file).

Both of these sightings were also investigated by the USAF-sponsored university COLORADO PROJECT which called upon the Joint NIGAP-COLORADO PROJECT "Early Warning Coordinator" system of the NICAP, as a courtesy to send the Massachusetts case.

It would be of great value to UFO researchers if local USAF AFB UFO officers could submit detailed sightings reports to the Joint NIGAP-COLORADO PROJECT system rather than to USAF MIlitary/government agencies. This would indicate that the government is giving UFOs serious attention, rather than the usual secrecy and unacknowledged investigation which would normally indicate that the government is not taking the UFO problem seriously.

It is very apparent to me that "Bluebook" is certainly not representative of the true government attitude and functions, which controls investigation, research and lower-echelon military and intelligence personnel. I trust that such steps as a stronger attitude and actions to obtain public information may have "thought-time" for a second look and re-evaluate the facts.

USAF Government public "image" of UFOs and made UFO facts uninterested segment of the scientific community. Colorado is a welcome sign of official transition.

(*) except for Airline Pilot sightings.

Sincerely,
Raymond E. Fowler
Chairman: NIGAP MASS.

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTINGS - 7/26-27/67 - Newton, N.H.  
DATE: 11 August 1967  
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler  
Consultant: NICAP MASS SUBCOM  
TO: NICAP, Washington, D.C.  

* - Included under NOTES 2 as information possibly having connection with Newton UFO.  

SIGHTING BACKGROUND:
Upon returning from vacation on July 25th, I was notified the following regarding a UFO sighting with my sister (Mrs. Evelyn Trappier) and brother-in-law (Mr. Harry G. Trappier) earlier in the evening. The sighting was made by this party to a very unusual UFO sighting with a sister (Mrs. Evelyn Trappier) and brother-in-law (Mr. Harry G. Trappier) earlier in the evening. The sighting was made by this party at approximately 11:00 PM EDT and continued until approximately 1:30 AM EDT on the night of August 15-16, 1967 on their property in Newton, N.H.  

Two interviews with the witnesses have been conducted in addition to two telephone calls. The first interview was conducted by NICAP SUBCOM Investigator Richard Fowler and the second interview, conducted August 4, 1967, was attended by Richard Fowler and NICAP Subcommittee member Ronald Duey and myself.  

The Colorado team arrived late in the evening at Logan Airport, Boston, Massachusetts on August 9, 1967. The morning of August 10, 1967 was spent by the team in making inquiries at Hanscom AFB and the Gloucester, Massachusetts Newspaper office, regarding information pertaining to the Newton, N.H. sighting which occurred on August 15-16, 1967. The afternoon was spent by the Colorado team at my home in Newton, N.H. on August 10, 1967.  The afternoon was spent by the Colorado team at my home in Newton, N.H. on August 10, 1967.  

CHARACTER OF WITNESS(ES):
Mr. and Mrs. Trappier are members of the First Baptist Church in Newton, New Hampshire. I phoned Rev. McClelan who is their minister and who knows them well. He told me that they are both highly regarded church people who would not seek publicity. Mrs. Trappier is the Sexton and Organist at the Church. Both Gary Story and Evelyn Trappier were radio operators.

and have had experience in the identification of conventional aircraft. Both have had military and civilian training beyond high school but do not hold degrees. We received the impression that all witnesses were following the strange craft.

{ * telephoned Rev. MacClean on 12 August 1967, RR #1,  WEARE, CODY 603-529-2274. }

SIGHTING ACCOUNT:
The following account has been compiled from signed UFO Data Sheets and processed through various steps of verification and authentication in other sections of this report.

On the date in question this witness and had brought his telescope with him and was observing the night sky. At about 11:00 p.m. he noticed a bright, star-like light higher than most aircraft and it seemed much larger than the normal aircraft lights. He watched it for some time and it remained stationary. No sound could be heard at any time. As he continued to observe the object, he noticed that it seemed to go out of sight to the left, but almost immediately he could see it again to the right. This was baffling to him as it should have taken some time to cross the field of view if it were an aircraft or meteor.

It continued to move from left to right and then back again in a sort of zig-zag pattern. No one else was with him who could verify these observations at the time. Each time the object disappeared in the left portion of the field of view, it seemed to reappear in the right, always holding its elongated shape. After watching it for about 10 minutes, it began to move in a generally northerly direction. As it began to move, he noted that a bright light appeared on the bottom of the object. This light seemed to pulsate and blink at varying intervals. 

As the object moved northward, it seemed to increase in brightness as it descended towards the horizon. Two white lights became visible on the rear portion of the object. These lights appeared to be flashing or pulsating in a synchronized manner. The object was observed for a total of approximately 30 minutes before it disappeared below the horizon.

sight but still could be heard for awhile. The object was still nowhere in sight but was going away as it appeared the second time suddenly. It appeared in the same spot where it had shut off its lights but as a bright fiery glow like object of a round configuration and approximately the same size as previously lighting configuration of 2 white lights and a red light. This object soon disappeared and did not reappear.

SIGHTING DATA: * - except the two white lights, when flashing, response - 

The object seen through the telescope just about took up the whole field of view during the initial pass of the object but was 10 sec closer on each pass of the object. The brightness of the object's lights varied with the observer.

The apparent brightness of the object's lights seemed to vary from as bright as a 1st mag star to as faint as nearly undetectable. The lights were like distant car lights.

The size of the lights were all described as the size of a small light, were closely grouped and appeared to be on one edge of the object.

The solid object was seen only by Gary with the telescope. The others could only see the lights through what appeared to be a dark body or shadow. The object was estimated to be about 200 yards away and about the size of a car, appearing at the level of the treetops when nearest last quarter phase.

The elevation of the object increased as the object moved closer from the first sighting. It was seen to rise slightly when making the second pass, was about the same elevation on the third pass, and appeared to be about the same elevation on the fourth pass.

Though estimates of the apparent size varied, he was asked to compare it's apparent size with the full moon, which was about 2 degrees. He estimated it was slightly smaller than the full moon.

During the sighting, it was almost impossible to see any detail. Gary did not recognize better but in the distance the dark outline he saw through the telescope.

The observer stated that the object appeared to move down as if it started to move if Francis saw the change from a white to a strange color. It started slowly then sped up greatly escaping from the observers' field of view through the telescope.

This caused the object to display only a white light and a red light. All lights shut off unexpectedly when the object was at the most distant part of its observed travel. The lights reappeared out-of-sight, before returning to the same white light configuration again.

All lights became bright and distinct again as the object came closer. Gary could always see the white lights with his unaided eye. During the whole sighting including this dimming mode, Gary could always see the flashing sequence particularly in the red light mode. 

When it flashed twice and disappeared on its last easter1y pass, the sighting area is seven countryside and in an area of complete silence.

Dear Sir,

I would like to ask you some questions about U.S.O.R.

If there really are U.S.O.R.'s, because some material shows they could be real, I don't know how much to believe the reports, unless there is geographical and other data to give them more credibility. Can you give me any information on U.S.O.R.'s or refer me to any sources?

August 11, 1967 a U.S.O. was reported W.C: 55 15 to 11:00. something crashed in the water and sank, but no samples recovered. Can you give me any information on this or other U.S.O. sightings?

At this time of night, Acoustics are such that traffic can sometimes be heard up to 5 miles away. The object never passed in-front-of or behind-of anything while in the area.
The speed of the object was constant and although no estimate was made, it was computed to be only several hundred miles per hour. It was compared to the speed of a jet fighter, which was estimated as 600-800 mph in that area.
The object moved back- and-forth in Westerly and Easterly flight paths. The object's movements appeared to have been a search pattern. No specific direction was indicated that they were looking at NNE and ENE flight terminus points, or as are of complete pattern that would have been oriented to MLS and other range marker.
The time lasted between estimates of 5-10 minutes. Such maneuvers would be those of a jet fighter in course corrections and variations between estimates of 5-10 miles such maneuvers in the order of 2 to 3 minutes. Ten such maneuvers in 30 minutes would mean an angular velocity for the object of approximately 10+ degrees per minute.

7/26-27/67 - NEWTON, N.H.

DATE: 27 July 1967
TIME: 2:00 AM EDT
WITNESSESS: 4 Knots
VEHICLE: Automobile

TELESCOPE DATA (Refracting Type)
MANUFACTURER: TASCO, 1075 N.W. 71st St., Miami, Florida 33138
OBJECTIVE DIAMETER: 60 mm
FOCAL LENGTH: 700 mm
OBJECTIVE STRENGTH: 4000 mm
EYEPIECE: H15.5 mm
DIAGONAL PRISM: 45° (used during observation, giving up-right image)

BINOCULAR DATA 
MANUFACTURER: TASCO
MAGNIFICATION: 7X (stated)
POWER: 35 mm
PERFORMANCE: 1000 yards/117 Feet

SPECIAL FEATURES IN AREA
"Long stretch of 138KV power lines run in about an East to West direction about 5 miles north of the observers. This shows on the map showing the direction of the sighting in relation to the witnesses. Map shows they run in a NNE to SSW direction."

The nearest Airport, to, the sighters area would be Haverstill Municipal Airport, about 7 miles North of the observers. This airport is not active during the early morning hours.

SIGHTING EVALUATION
Astronomical/Satellite: - Negative
Conventional Aircraft: - Improbable (Overall Data rules such out unless positive observer-observer exists)
No sound was heard and helicopter or plane would have been heard easily in this area - no conventional lighting lights were observed. When jet aircraft approached which would be against regulations that close to the airfield, the objects remained stationary for long periods - the abrupt reversals and erratic behavior and disappearance could not be accounted for by conventional aircraft.

The flashing like an "identification responder" can only be postulated, and the sudden maneuvering observed (up 60 minutes) under the circumstances would indicate a definitely unconventional aerial objects.

SIGHTING EVALUATION (continued)
Conventional Aircraft: (continued) ((SEE NOTE I ))
Both aircraft were military and were apparently families with aircraft and were
Radar Observers during their military course. They appeared to look like
families returning t.o the air-base. THIS AIRCRAFT HAS BEEN POSITIVELY
IDENTIFIED: Hoax: Improbable in ligh t of wi tness background and consistent
accounts of their s ightings.

NOTE I: My first guess at an explanation when first learning of this
sighting was that a conventional aircraft with its landing
lights on was responsible for the UFO sightings. This would have explained
the abrupt reversal on the end of the first sighting as well this may have accounted 
for the oth er sightings. However, upon considering the additional
data, I am convinced that this can not be the answer. The reversal and other
maneuvering of the obj ects as reported would hardly be consistent with
conventional aer a. During these other passes the white light
would be visible and would rise vertically, hover, dart, etc. and both
white lights would appear and the object would reverse its path. This was not clear
in the initial report, but the additional data strongly indicates that the observers
trailing and maneuvering of the obj ects would not fit any conventional
aerial vehicle. However, repeated attempts by the observers to correlate 
the sightings with any aircraft in the area have not been successful. The other
data, such as color changes, extreme speeds, hovering, and vertical ascents
and descents of the objects would eliminate the possibility of these being
conventional aircraft. So I must conclude that some unconventional aircraft
or phenomenon was responsible for the sightings reported by these witnesses.

Further checks: - The Colorado team is making a check-out of a
jet fighter(?) that was flying south to North
course and was identified. This would
further substantiate the evidence that the object
is limited in those areas.

CONCLUSION: If this is the only occurrence, I would conclu
de out conventional aircraft. The evidence seems to be
in favor of a definately unconventional and artificial
object. However, since no photographic evidence was obtained, it would
be classified "UNK" unless further evidence is forthcoming that would
indicate the true nature of this sighting.

7/26-27/67 - NEWTON, N.J. 

NAME: POSSIBLE SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR THIS SIGHTING

On 7/30/67 I received a phone call from Mr. Paul Muser, Superintendent of the New England Military School on air base in Newton, Massachusetts. He said that on 7/26 and 7/27/67 they observed a bright light in the sky like a searchlight beam which seemed to be at a high altitude. The light would dim and then brighten again. This happened several times. He checked doors, etc. before retiring when he heard a loud scratching noise on the outside screens. He looked out the windows and saw nothing. The next day the same thing occurred again. He looked out the windows and saw nothing so rushed outside. He then spotted the light in the sky which he described as clear, then suddenly dim down like a dying campfire, then brighten up again rather quickly. This occurred several times. 

The document then goes on to discuss reported phone calls from residents north of Boston concerning a weird humming sound and strange activities, as well as local law enforcement investigating the incident. It also mentions an orange glow being observed in the sky during the sighting. The report concludes by stating that the incident seems to be of the increase in this area, and that the sighting was apparently observed by many and is worthy of investigation.

CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS:
There are minor inconsistencies on the part of the witnesses' account such as apparent size, number of passes, etc. and this is to be expected. However, the basic facts are consistent and this is to be considered reliable. The witness had first observed the object at 11:03 AM and then he observed it again at 1:50 AM, but he estimated that it was approximately 1:10 AM when he first observed it. The fact that his estimate of the time was off in this manner would mean if maintained this position like a stationary star. However, this was not observed continuously. It cannot be proved that it was always in the same position, since the observation was not continuous.
The UFO characteristics described as such: 1) A cylindrical configuration, 2) No exhaust or visible propulsion system, 3) Unconventional maneuvers and speeds, and 4) No noise associated. This all points to an INTELLIGENCE SOURCE which would indicate some kind of INTELLIGENTLY MANEUVERED DEVICE, not merely an INANIMATE OBJECT, BUT a device under some form of INTELLIGENT CONTROL. The fact that the object could maneuver abruptly and change directions within 10 seconds of the stimulus overwhelming points to an INTELLIGENT CONTROL and MANEUVERING MECHANISM.
The object was not photographed, nor were any samples collected. However, other signif icant factors are mentioned in limited number of other signallings.
This report is of MAJOR importance if the contents are accurate. The facts appear to be reasonably established and the investigation to be conducted under Subcommittees will be formed and tied into the EARLY-WARNING SYSTEM.

Respectively submitted,
Raymond E. Fowler

The image appears to contain a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. There is no photograph present in this image. I will now transcribe the text found in the document:

Date 1967 April 5.32 G.M.T.
Time past time at end point 92 sec
Apparent elevation at end point: 
- at 20° = 42° 52' 2 = 48° 28' at 129 km
Ending ele at 89 km 
Ending azm at 89 km 23° 11' 0 = 44° 23' at 81 km
Altitude: s= 555 km h = 519.3 km 
Observed velocity: 41 km/sec
Radiant with atmosphere correction h = 19.3
         a = 144.1°
         d = 39.2°
Parabolic orbit: 
a = 146.9" 
e = 1.0
q = 0.93 A.U.

FIREBALL of 1967 July 24.69 G.M.T.
I.A.U.C. No. 2113

This fireball is unique, so far as the writer knows, in that it appeared over the Atlantic Ocean and its radiant was determined by the Project Duplication Team, W.W. Salisbury of the National Research Council, Canada, and others. The essential data follow in order:
Arrival time: 1967 July 24.69 G.M.T.
Duration: 3.0 sec.
Brightness: Comparable to full moon
Trajectory: Last seen heading upward and slightly ESE.
Apparent altitude of point of disappearance: 15 to 20 deg. (precise value uncertain)

R.A. = 20° 31', DEC = +46° 36', 20° 10.15 sec.
H = 155° 50', W = 55° 28' PI = 19° 30' D = 1.10 sec.
H = 13° 30', W = 52° 55', PI = 16° 37' D = 0.90 sec. 
H = 11° 00', W = 51° 00', PI = 14° 01' D = 0.75 sec.
H = 9° 00', W = 49° 15', PI = 12° 18' D = 0.60 sec.
(Precise times uncertain)

It is obvious that as two longitude and three latitude are given only to whole degrees, the precision of the results is compromised. The duration, however, is 3.0 sec. with a beginning flash lasting 0.2 sec. as seen at all stations. Such reported events differ because of differences in sensitivity, location etc. This fireball is considered to be a real event, being reported from several stations throughout eastern North America. Its brightness suggests that the apparent magnitude may well have been -12 or even more. For location, the usual place would be a spot in the Atlantic Ocean about 75 n mi SE of New Jersey, latitude 38° N, longitude 72° W.

Date 1967 July 24.69 G.M.T.
Ending over 65.90° W 37° N, at 99.6° h = 15 km
Path ling 65.90° W 
Path 39 km 
Radiant uncorrected R.A. = 304°, DEC = 24°

It is obvious that the solution is too approximate to warrant calculation of an orbit, but despite this shortcoming, the fireball's probable errors in the sightings, the conditions are too unique and to place this fireball on record.
