INSTRUCTOR, AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE OFFICER COURSE- INTERVIEWS
WITH OBSERVERS ONE AND TWO REVEALED THAT OBSERVER ONE FIRST
SIGHTED THE UFO AND POINTED IT OUT TO OBSERVER TWO. OBSERVER ONE
STATES THAT THE OBJECTS WERE IN V FORMATION MOVING FROM SE TO
NE AND DISAPPEARED INSTANTANEOUSLY SECONDS LATER. OBSERVER TWO
THOUGHT AT FIRST THE OBJECT WAS A STAR BUT APPARENTLY WAS
CONVINCED BY OBSERVER ONE THAT IT WAS UFO'S. BOTH OBSERVERS
HAD BEEN LYING ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING. SKY CONDITIONS AT
THIS TIME WAS SCATTERED WITH HIGH BROKEN CLOUD COVER. WIND
WAS FROM 278 TO 233 DEGREES. IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE OBJECT
SEEN WAS A STAR. BY LOOKING STRAIGHT WITH NO REFERENCE POINT
IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET THE ILLUSION THAT THE STAR WAS MOVING IN
CAUSE OF CLOUDS MOVING TO THE SE. CHICAGO CENTER ADVISES THAT
THERE WAS NO KNOWN AIRCRAFT TRAFFIC OVER CHAMPAIGN AT THE TIME
OF THE REPORTED SIGHTING.
