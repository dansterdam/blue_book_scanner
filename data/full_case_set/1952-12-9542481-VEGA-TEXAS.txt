AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DATE OF INFORMATION 9 December 1952
DATE OF REPORT 9 December 1952
SUMMARY:
Following report of unidentified objects in the sky was given by two A-13A pilots: Aircraft on routine training flight from Reese Air Force Base, Texas, spotted two round, white, fast moving objects at 40,000 feet altitude on 9 December 1952 at 1800 hours. These objects were observed for approximately 10 minutes. They did not change course or altitude during this period. The pilot and co-pilot both observed these objects, which appeared to be metallic in nature and were not aircraft. Other pilots have reported similar objects in this area. Such reports are considered usually reliable.

SUBJECT: AIR CORPS FIELD, TEXAS
PAGE 2 OF 23 PAGES
(1) On 3 July 1952 one object was observed which was slightly oblong in shape and about 60 feet in diameter. The object was observed at 10:10 - 10:26 p.m. Central Standard Time a t the Air Corps Field, Texas. The object was sighted visually and also detected by radar. The object was described as a bright light which appeared to flash at regular intervals of about two seconds. The speed of the object was estimated to be 1,500-2,000 mph. The object was under observation for 16 minutes and 15 seconds. It then disappeared into the clouds.
(2) The object was sighted at 21:33 hours. Central Standard Time, and was observed for about 5 minutes.
(3) Observation was made visually from a T-33 aircraft, altitude 3,000 feet. The object was also tracked on radar.
(4) Location of observers was on 48' 15" N, 102' 15" W, approximately 5 miles south of the Air Corps Field, Texas. The object was about eleven o'clock to the south west of the observers and was at an elevation of about 30 degrees.
(5) The two officers have not previously experienced the observation of any similar objects as described here. The observation was made during routine flights in the military service nearly ten years and Captain DOWLEY has logged about 3000 hours flight time.
(6) Weather was clear with visibility fifty miles and with wind velocity of about 10 knots.
(7) There was no known condition, meteorological or otherwise, which would account for the sighting.
(8) There is no known existence of evidence of such as fragments, photography, or other tangible evidence.
(9) At the time of sighting, the two officers related the observation as in the Air Intelligence Report. No further action was taken.
(10) Shortly before the observation was made, an unidentified background aircraft was sighted at an altitude of about 7,000 feet.

There is no photograph or image present on this page. This appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report from Project Blue Book, containing a written statement by Captain Willard F. Bowlby.

The text of the report is as follows:

STATEMENT BY CAPTAIN WILLARD F. BOWLBY
On 13 January 1952 Captain WILLARD F. BOWLBY, participated in a tracking operation of a visual object observed by ground observers. This object was tracked by Captain BOWLBY in his F-86 jet for approximately 20 minutes at which time the object was lost from view. The object was first sighted at approximately 11:20 AM CST by observers at the Ground Intercept Radar Station near Amarillo, Texas. The object was traveling at an estimated speed of 800-900 knots and an altitude of approximately 60,000 feet. Ground radar confirmed the presence of the object. Captain BOWLBY was then scrambled to intercept the object. Visual contact was made and the object was closely trailed for approximately 20 minutes at which time the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. The object appeared to be a white or very light gray circular object, slightly larger than a P-51 fighter plane. During the time it was under observation, the object maintained a relatively steady course and altitude, although minor deviations were noted. At the time the object was lost from view, Captain BOWLBY estimated it to be in excess of 7,000 feet and traveling at a speed far beyond the capability of any known aircraft.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED

Statements by Captain WILLIAM T. LEWIS

On the night of 29 December 1952, Captain WILLIAM T. LEWIS was on duty as the Officer-in-Charge of the 3505th Interceptor Squadron, Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona. At 2130 hours, the radar operator reported a high speed target 80 miles southwest of Tucson, at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. Captain LEWIS observed the unidentified target on the radarscope for about 20 minutes. He reported that it appeared to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, making a sharp turn, and then disappearing from the scope. He stated that it was unlike any known type of aircraft. Captain LEWIS further reported that during the time the target was visible, it made an abrupt change in course which would be impossible for any known type of aircraft at that time. Captain LEWIS stated that the target appeared to be under intelligent control.
