The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and illustrations. The diagram shows a curved line and a compass rose, and the instructions ask the viewer to mark certain points on these illustrations. The text below the diagram and illustrations provides further instructions for the viewer to follow.

in the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass when you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

April 7, 1967
Narrative:
On the night of April 7, 1967, I was driving on route 11 approximately 5 miles north of Salem, Virginia, returning home from the city of Salem when I observed a large, bright light in the sky. The light was hovering and appeared to be composed of smaller lights clustered together. As I drove closer, the light began to move and quickly accelerated out of sight. The object was silent and did not appear to have any other distinguishing features. I was the only witness to this event.

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object Report

1. On 7 April 1967, this office received a report of a sighting of an unidentified flying object near Salem, Virginia. The report was forwarded to Project Blue Book for analysis.

2. The object was described as a dome-shaped, disc-like craft approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed moving slowly at an altitude of approximately 1000-1500 feet. The object emitted a bright glow and made a humming sound. It was observed for approximately 10-15 minutes before disappearing from view.

3. Interview of the witness indicates that the object was not an aircraft, satellite, or any known natural phenomenon. Project Blue Book has been unable to identify the object.

4. Based on the information available, this office is unable to provide a conclusive explanation for the sighting. The report has been forwarded to Project Blue Book for further analysis and inclusion in their files.

No physical evidence of the object was found at the scene. The report was evaluated as an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) due to the credible witness account and lack of a conventional explanation.

NEAR SALEM, VIRGINIA - APRIL 7, 1967

On April 7, 1967, at approximately 8:00 P.M., Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Darr, who reside on a farm near Salem, Virginia, observed a strange object in the sky over their property.

Mr. Darr was outside doing some chores when he noticed the object hovering over a field about 100 yards from the house. He called his wife to come and look at it. They both watched the object for about 15 minutes. 

The object appeared to be round or circular in shape, about 25 to 30 feet in diameter, and surrounded by a hazy, blurry light. It hovered silently over the field, then suddenly shot straight up into the sky and disappeared from view.

Mr. and Mrs. Darr were both convinced that what they saw was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. They described it as a "strange, unidentified flying object."

This incident was reported to the local police department and the United States Air Force, which was conducting investigations of UFO sightings under Project Blue Book.
