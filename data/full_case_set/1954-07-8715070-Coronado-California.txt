SFCT INTELLIGENCE REPORT, Subj: Report of Unidentified Aerial Object
TO: Major General, Coronado, California

22 July 1954

Adviaed that, while standing in front of his home on Coronado Boulevard at Coronado, California, he had heard the sound of an object which appeared to be proceeding slightly southwest at a high speed which seemed to be coming straight for him.

He said that he could make no estimation as to the altitude, and described the object as looking like a light about the size of an automobile tire, which appeared to be above the trees, which he estimated to be at 1500 feet, and which appeared to be round, white and luminous. General further stated that he considered the sound he heard important enough to report, as during his 25 years military aviation, he had become acquainted with the sound of jets, rockets, and artillery shells, and that this sound did not seem to be any of these, and that he did not know what it was.

ACTION: No similar reports relative to this matter were received, and no action was taken as a result of this report by this District Office.
