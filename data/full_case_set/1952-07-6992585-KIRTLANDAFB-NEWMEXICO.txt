AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO.
DATE 2-8-52
FROM Operations, Maxwell Air 
Force Base, Alabama
PAGE 1     OF 1 PAGES

The following account of the sighting of an unidentified flying object is submitted.

1. The object, sighted in the vicinity of Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, appeared round and about the size of a pencil head. The single object changed colors from white to amber to bright red. There was no trail and no sound coming from the object. When not travelling in a straight line it appeared to be suspended in the air. During the sighting the object made no unusual maneuvers. It disappeared gradually.

2. Object was sighted at approximately 2310 hours (local time) 30 July 1952 and remained in sight ten (10) or twenty (20) minutes.

3. Three of the four observers used field glasses (power 7 x 50) to accomplish the sighting. The fourth observer viewed the object with naked eye.

4. The observers were located in the Maxwell Control Tower (32°23'N 86°22'W), facing west. The object was estimated to be 20 to 25 miles from the observers, travelling SW at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet.

5. The original observer, chief of the tower crew, claims 13 months experience as a tower operator. Two other observers were members of the tower crew, with two months experience apiece. The fourth observer was NCIC of AACS Facilities at Maxwell. All of them disclaim previous sightings of unidentified flying objects.

6. At time of sighting winds at 30,000 feet were 70 to 85 knots, clouds were scattered at 28,000 feet, visibility was 15 miles plus, temperature was 81°, and surface winds were SSW at 7 knots.

7. There was no activity or condition in the area which might be responsible for the sighting.

8. No physical evidence of the sighting was obtained.

9. Interception or identification action was not taken because of the unavailability of necessary resources.

10. At one time during the sighting there was a C-47 aircraft over Maxwell travelling S to W at 5,000 feet. An attempt was made to contact the pilot but the attempt proved unsuccessful.

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Object

1. Observation was made by the undersigned at approximately 2310 hours on 30 July 1952, from the west side of Maxwell tower, seventy-five (75) feet above ground level.

2. Object was seen west of Maxwell Field and appeared to be at a distance of more than twenty-five (25) miles and at an altitude of more than twenty (20) thousand feet.

3. Close observation through the use of binoculars revealed that this phenomenon was a revolving spherical mass similar to, but larger than, a star whose colors alternately changed from light blue to amber and red. There was no sound coming from that direction and no trails were observed. The object, definitely not a conventional type of aircraft, had a slight swaying motion similar to the one of a pendulum. Its motion covered an angle of approximately fifteen (15) degrees. It was still in the same location at 2345 hours, the time at which I left my post.

4. The above facts are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Maxwell. This object was about thirty (30) to thirty-five (35) thousand
feet in altitude and traveled from S3 to 77°. The object seemed to change
colors from white to bright red. It was in sight for approximately ten
(10) minutes.

2. I will not eliminate the possibility of this object being some
form of astrology, however, in my opinion it was not.

It looked something like a falling star except that it was suspended.
The color appeared to change from the time seen red to bright white.
There was no set rule as to the time. At times the object seemed to
be stationary and other times it moved up and then to the west slowly.
I observed the object while under the weather observer's observation
scope, which is built into the window. I observed that the object was
turning as it began to recede. I kept it in sight for approximately
twenty (20) minutes up to 2320 hours local. I estimate the height

NARRATIVE SUMMARIZED BY: Captain Eugene P. Daspid

HEADQUARTERS, 2ND AIR FORCE, as opinions below, ATION/C-D/C-2, HQ USAF, dtd 19 Dec 1951, referring to above report. Dissemination on Unidentified objects lacking documentation. 

SUBJECT: Requirements of Information in this Type of Report

SUMMARY: (Cover explanation of report. Give opinions in general on these particular people. List references or lead-ins. Brief analysis of report as of 27 Sept 52. - N.T.)

1. At approximately 2335 hours CST, 30 July 1952, Captain Eugene P. Daspid and Technical Sergeant James B. Hansen sighted an unusual object on the PPI scope of an AN/CPS-5 radar set located at Keesler AFB, Mass.

2. The target, which appeared on the PPI scope in a teardrop shape, was first sighted at an azimuth of 330° approximately forty-three (43) miles distant. The size of the target was estimated to be approximately that of a B-36 aircraft.

3. During the period of observation, the target was seen to travel in a general southerly direction for a distance of one (1) mile; a maneuver which involved two (2) minutes. It remained in a near stationary position for four (4) minutes. The object then began a very slow movement north for an approximate period of three (3) minutes where it again assumed a stationary position for two (2) almost, then disappeared completely. The target reappeared approximately three (3) minutes later and began a more rapid movement in a northerly direction for approximately FIFTY (50) miles (from the CPS-5 set) at which point it disappeared from the PPI scope. The nearest estimate as to rate of speed was forty-five (45) to fifty (50) miles per hour.

4. The unusual maneuvers and the slow speed of the sighted object, in addition to a prevailing temperature inversion, has led the observer to advance the opinion that the target was a non-flying object. Acting upon this assumption a General Agent for the Illinois Central Railroad, Emmet...

                                          STATEMENT

Personally appeared before me, the undersigned, authorized to
administer oaths in cases of this nature, Captain
3998th Technical Training Squadron, 3303A Technical Train-
ing Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, and upon being warned
of his rights under the 31st Article, Uniform Code of Military Justice,
and upon being duly sworn according to law, made the following volun-
tarily sworn statement:

"At approximately 2335 hours CST, 30 July 1952, Technical Sergeant
                     the undersigned located an unusual blip (target) on
the PPI scope of the CPS-5 radar set, located at Keesler Air Force Base.
The target was first sighted at an azimuth of 335°, approximately
forty-three (43) miles from the site of the radar set. The target moved
very slowly south for approximately two (2) minutes, moving only a mile
or so; it then stopped for a period of four (4) minutes; it than began a
very slow movement north for three (3) minutes, stopped for two (2) min-
utes and disappeared. Approximately three (3) minutes later, it reap-
peared and began moving at a more rapid pace north and at fifty (50) miles
from our site, the target disappeared completely. The estimated speed
of the target was forty (40) to forty-five (45) miles per hour.

"During the observation at 2400 hours CST, the undersigned requested
the two tower operators to scan the azimuth of 330° to 340° with binocu-
lars to ascertain if they could sight any object or lights, moving or
stationary. Only one star was sighted.

"A query was made by the undersigned to the Base Weather Forecaster;
these records indicated that a temperature inversion was existent over
the area in which the target (blip) was sighted. Further study of these
position of the track on TAC 167 revealed a railroad track and highway in
line with the position of the target.

"In view of the above findings, it is the opinion of the undersigned
that the object sighted (on the radar scope only) was some ground vehicle
and the unusual pick up was caused by the prevailing atmospheric condi-
tions.

"It is recommended that the Illinois Central Railroad be contacted
to ascertain if any trains operated in the vicinity of Keesler and

That wouldn't fit it then.. a little incident happened up in
that area out of my area there of so, it's out while it was on
train projection, thanks it does affect certain military areas.

Mr.

Well, if you want this figure any closer, any other way we can
let' you, 'just let me know and I will get after them. You see,
I called up there and that's what they gave me. I talked to
the trainmaster's office. But that time in Battlesburg 14 spots

The document contains two simple sketches, not actual photographs. The first sketch appears to be a circle with a smaller circle beneath it, perhaps depicting a spherical object. An arrow points to the right, indicating the direction of movement. The second sketch features two circles of differing sizes, with a pair of lines resembling a simple face with eyes, and an arrow pointing to the right, representing movement.

Here is the text as requested, acting as an OCR:

There are two hand-drawn diagrams in the image. The first diagram shows a straight dashed line labelled "STATIONARY" with arrows pointing from "A" to "B" (labeled "ROUGHLY WEST TO EAST"), indicating motion, and at point "B" there is text saying "OUT OF SIGHT". The pattern of the lines suggests an object moving across the sky and then disappearing from sight.

The second diagram shows two shapes: one is a cross with a circle in the center, and the other is an ellipse. There are notes beside these shapes. 

Here is the OCR output of the text in the document:

The document features hand-drawn illustrations rather than actual photographs. These illustrations appear to depict unidentified flying objects (UFOs) as described in the report. There are three main drawings in the document:

1. The first depicts a blacked-out ellipse with a clear, dotted outline, labelled "Glowing orb."
2. The second image shows an irregular line annotated as "Paint Light Reflected From Overcast above Object."
3. The third drawing, similar to the first, shows a dotted outlined ellipse, labelled "Glowing orb 3200° color," with additional smaller lights beneath it, described as "Small Lights Underneath Appeared to be Reflected Eight From Within Object on Either Itself or Something Underneath."

The image does not contain a photograph. It seems to be a page with various stamps, handwritten notations, and typed elements.

Some of the text seems to be notation related to the document's processing within military or government channels, evidenced by the reference to Kirtland AFB (Air Force Base) in New Mexico and possible date-time groups or codes.

The image contains a photograph at the bottom which appears to be very faint and seems to show hand-drawn arrows or symbols, oriented in various directions, with the letter "W" next to one of the arrows. There's also a handwritten annotation "0725 E" near the bottom right corner of the photograph. The quality is poor and the image is indistinct, making it difficult to determine what is depicted beyond these symbols.

The document appears to be a questionnaire response with additional commentary related to the sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The content includes descriptions of how a trail was observed, descriptions of the object's appearance, and the behavior of the phenomenon as witnessed by the respondent and mentioned daughter. Some parts of the text are not completely clear due to the quality of the scan or the handwriting.

26. Was this the first time that you have seen an object like this?
(Circle One): Yes No

26.1      If you answered NO, then when, where, and under what conditions
did you see other ones?

27.  In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have
caused it?        do not know.     I first wondered if something 
was coming down and will explode.     When movement changed and trail
beginning movement took off toward Southeast, wondered if Kirt Base
was having some kind of practice or test, or if it could be that
an enemy was experimenting from high above with a guided missile,
or experimenting with something not dangerous to see what could be
directed to a given spot successfully or not in event an enemy
desired to effect sabotage or war.
23. Give the following information about yourself:

          NAME

Reference
5220710/61, Your Pg.5, #1.1. The movement appeared to go down into
or behind a large cloud beneath it and I wondered if it would appear
again in the blue sky beneath it as I watched but instead it came out
but leaving a much narrower appearing trail out from the south east
end of the cloud.

#20. 1 Though the trail was many feet above the earth, yet I am not
able to judge how many hundreds of feet high.

I felt hesitant to report the movement for possibly our
Government authorities might be fully aware of this & I would not
want to hinder or trouble with a trifle and yet I reasoned that if
they knew all about it there should not be any harm done in reporting
and so I immediately 'phoned last no one in authority could have seen
it from where they were and, therefore, might be wisdom to follow it up
to determine if it were something that was, or was not, according the
regulations.

       At 3:19 pm on Wednesday, July 30, 1952, I was sitting at a table by a 
picture window and my little five year old daughter called my attention to 
something in the sky at about a 50° angle toward the southwest which appeared 
to be coming directly down from the clouds, bluish sky above. The sky beneath 
appeared blue and the movement seemed very steady or even. The trail it left 
behind appeared white, thick, like fleecy white clouds, and not over four 
inches wide. Then, going straight down, disappeared into a large white cloud,
sort of greyish, toward the east.
 
       We watched to see if something would oust into this cloud but it did not 
appear in the blue sky between the cloud but instead, after a short time, about 
two minutes, we saw the movement with a sort of "twisty" appearance going hori-
zontally instead of straight down and behind it left, or only the appearance of 
thick, fleecy solid white, the width to the eye now only about like a clothes 
line line and going into the blue sky toward south a little but much more toward 
the east. We went outside in front of our house which is south facing on East
Mantato Street. 

       Then, because of trees across the street, it was lost to sight toward 
the southeast at an angle of about 35° at 3:26.

       The white trail did not seem to widen as it disappeared but rather faded 
out slowly from top part of rear end as trail moved southward.

(Circle One): Yes or No

29.2 Please list their names and addresses:
I am unable to list their names as They lived across the

I feel rather silly answering this particular

Army A.F.B. advised me to make an official report & besides "I
did" I remember no eliminations that were werthy to mention
but I did see an object which I am unable to identify.

My delay in answering were caused by my attendance
at school at Fort Holoberd, Maryland from 9 August-1-December.

HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY
FORT SAM HOUSTON. TEXAS

1 August 1952

SUBJECT: Sight of Unidentifiable Object

TO: Commanding General
     Fourth Army
     Fort Sam Houston, Texas
     ATTN: ACoFS, G-2

The undersigned lives at 681D, Infantry Post, Fort Sam Houston,
Texas. At 2230 hours, 31 July 1952, he heard his neighbors make the
following remarks: "There it is." "There comes one," etc. Lieutenant
******* went outside to investigate the possibility of seeing a
"Flying saucer." At approximately 2235, facing southwest, he saw an
object moving across the sky at a speed less than that of a jet but
seemingly greater than that of a conventional aircraft. It had no
blinking lights on its wings and no flaming exhaust. It had some type
of motor, as a hum was heard which seemed to be a hundred yards behind
the object. Its color was red in distinction to the stars, which were
yellow. The size seemed to be that of a star and the shape appeared to
be round. It did not seem to be burning, yet the entire object cast a
reddish glow. It appeared to be flying at an altitude of between 3,000
and 6,000 feet. It disappeared after being visible for a period of
about one minute.

At 1902Z on 30 July 1952, the pilot of an F-89 aircraft while
flying on a routine test hop contacted the GCI controller at
Casnil, Maine, for practice intercepts and Aitrborn Intercept
Training. The aircraft vectored to what the controller called
a "Meteorological Object" in the vicinity of Marys Hill, Maine.
The aircraft was doing at the speed of 150 knots per hour at an
altitude of 30,000 feet m.s.n. The object appeared to be at least
10,000 feet higher and the observed error hostile acters observed
about the unidentified. It appeared to be balloon-shaped, smooth,
and nothing protruding from it. It was of a white translucent
color. The observer is an A-1 source.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM (LOCATION):112th De'nse Wing
Presque Isle A.D., Maine
REPORT NO.
PAGE 2           OF 2 PAGES

At 1507 EMZ, 30 July 1952, Houlton, Maine Radio notified Presque Isle Tower
of call from Maine State Police of reported civilian sighting of unidentified
flying object over Monticello, Maine (46°48'N - 67°50'W). The OSI at this station
was advised of this report and very efforts has been made to contact the individuals
reporting this sighting. This has proved to be unsuccessful. The following infor-
mation was relayed to Presque Isle Tower concerning civilian report:

Shape - Unusual
Size - approximately 200 feet wide
Manner of Observation - no report
Speed - unknown
Length of time observed - unknown
Altitude - reported object as being just above clouds. Base Weather
          Station reported clouds at time of reported sighting to be
          5000 scattered

Air traffic in the general area at the time of sighting was one Canadian
helicopter which had departed this station at 1357 EMZ and landed at 1455 EMZ
approximately 13 miles (in the vicinity) of Monticello (47°01'N - 67°51'W).

Pilot reports having been in the air miles south of Monticello.

Taking into account the reported route taken by the Canadian helicopter
following take-off from this base, it is not unreasonable to assume the re-
ported sighting may have been that of this helicopter. The evaluation placed
upon this reported sighting is P-6.

At 1515 EMZ, 30 July an F-86 aircraft from 75th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron
was vectored to investigate a "meteorological objective" in the vicinity of Presque
Isle Air Force Base. The pilot reports having sighted object approximately 20 to 
25 miles at his 10:00 o'clock, 10,000 feet for approximately 15 minutes. Object appeared
as a white, opalite and glass, drop shape was a weather balloon approximately 6 feet
in diameter, white and pilot stated it was. This balloon was observed from 2,000
feet below object.

At 1545, second F-86 aircraft observed an object 80 to 90 east of this 
base. SW,000'. Pilot descriptions identical with first pilot report and also 
identified as weather balloon. Pilot stated he could not get closer than approxi-
mately 3 miles to object at 40,000 feet.

Local weather at the time of sighting as received from the Base Weather Office
was as follows:
5000 feet scattered, 20 miles visibility, temperature 74°, dew point 50,
wind S1 9 knots.
Visais alerts: 5001 - 250° 37 K
                15,000' - 200° 13 X
                20,001' - 240° 25 K
                30,000' - 240° 37 K

There is no inference or new fact ways observation within our radar faciylor an
soft files, of that sighting.

Evalution placed on pilots' observation is A-2.

The image contains a sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch appears to depict a classic "flying saucer" shape with a dome on top. There is text adjacent to the drawing that reads "Front View," "zig zagging life," "Saucer shaped & shiny silver," and near the bottom of the saucer it says, "Moved towards us and then to right." An arrow pointing to the left indicates the direction of movement.

STATEMENT OF WITNESS

I, Jack T. Keely, 7519 North Fourth street, Albuqurque, New Mexico
do hereby make the following statement.

On 30 July 1952 at approximately 2315 MST I saw a strange object
in the air. It was difficult to tell the altitude as the size was not
known. It was the same color and had the appearance of a star and 
was moving from East to West at a very high rate of speed. There was
no exhaust that could be seen. There was a constant light also to be 
seen. It appeared to be round and moved at different speeds. I observed 
this object for about 30 seconds.

29. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object?

(Circle One): Yes or No

29.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object too?

(Circle One): Yes or No

29.2 Please list their names and addresses:
[REDACTED]

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper if necessary.

o Description of what [ saw.
It was still light and one could see to the west
(citry east) in a clear northeastern sky an extremely
bright, white light moving in an arc swinging
or for about 30 seconds with no variation in altitude
or color whatsoever. When the light went out
a dark object appeared coming towards us. As
it came closer, its torpedo shape or cone and
fin like projection became evident. The 
swoosh type motion became evident. The
object came directly (from 20000 to about 2000)
as it came and gracefully took a north-
westerly 
(tempo) disappearing behind a hill of about
4000 feet altitude or places itself on the
same.
The object probably landed and stayed
for a short time on the ground at the western
tip of one of the Sandia.

The photograph depicts a hand-drawn sketch, which is meant to illustrate a sighting described in a UFO report. The drawing shows an oval-shaped object with an arrow pointing to the right, indicating the direction that the object was moving. There is handwriting next to the drawing that appears to be an annotation or identifier for the object, but it's not entirely legible.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and reproduce the text from the document:

SUBJECT FLUORBRPT

In accordance with AFI 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title: FLUORBRPT), the following, report of unidentified flying objects is submitted:

On 29 July 1952 + 2302 MST, 1st Lt. George E. Funk, Duty Controller, 135th AC&W Squadron, Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, N.M., observed a strange light in the western sky. In company with several airmen, Lt. Funk watched this light for approximately three minutes through a transit. He still was able to see and follow the light as it moved in the sky for about ten (10) minutes and gradually seemed to fade away. No radar contacts were made with the object by this squadron.

At approximately 0015 MST 30 July 1952, the 769th AC&W Squadron, Continental Divide, New Mexico was notified by Lt. Funk that an unconventional flying object had been sighted. This unit made electronic contact with the object and several people went outside of the building to look for it. The object was soon hovering under a cloud to the east. It hovered nearly motionless for a few minutes, and then, it traveled slowly a flat circle. The object appeared to be approximately 25 miles away and resembled a large light. When the object reached a speed of approximately 200-knots, the light went out, and it disappeared toward the north. The time of observations by observers at the 769th AC&W Squadron was approximately ten (10) minutes.

A fighter (F-86) from the 93rd Fighter Interceptor Squadron was scrambled in an attempt to intercept the object; however, no sighting was made by the fighter.

The reliability of the observers making the above sightings is considered good.

Please note that "CMA" likely stands for "comma" and is used to indicate where commas would be in the text, and "PD" may stand for "period." The text contains gaps and redactions. The date at the bottom seems to read "30/11/52 JUL. JESVA," possibly indicating July 30, 1952, although the letters following July are not a clear month abbreviation. The handwritten notation "Cy 1" is present at the end of the main text block. Additionally, there are some words and possibly numbers at the very bottom of the page, which are too faint to be legible.

1. An unidentified flying object was observed twenty-three miles north of Jackson-
ville, Florida, 30 July 1952. Sighting occurred at 0336 EST and the object was visible 
for a total of 4 or 5 minutes.

2. The object was sighted from the Eastern Airlines Flight 635/1, a constellation,
while passing the St. Marys Fan Marker. The aircraft was making a speed of 260 knots
at 3,000 feet when the sighting occurred. The object was described as a stationary,
extremely bright amber light which after 2 or 3 minutes accelerated to an extremely
high speed and headed in a westerly direction. The object was first observed off the 
left wing of the constellation, then moved directly in front of the aircraft and dis-
appeared from view off the right wing. It appeared to be 10 miles from the constalla-
tion.

3. Weather in the area at the time of sighting was clear, visibility 12 miles,
winds aloft 3,000 feet, 260°, 18 knots.

4. Witnesses: Captain ..., pilot of Eastern Airlines F635/1, and a 
co-pilot, name unknown. Officers may be contacted through Eastern Airlines Crew
Scheduling Officer, Mid-International Airport, Miami, Florida,
and exchange.

5. Known air traffic in the area at the time of sighting was one west bound C-97,
A 859, 15 miles north of Jacksonville, Florida.

6. Present employment of witnesses indicates adequate aerial observer qualifica-
tions.

IR-7-47-52

Flight Service, MATS
3600 Newark Street, N. W.
Washington 25, D. C.

1. An unidentified flying object was observed near Sunland, California, 30 July 1952. The sighting occurred at 1825PST.

2. The witnesses were seated on a porch in Sunland, California, watching planes arriving at Burbank, California, when they saw an intense white-blue light in a cloud to the north northwest. The light burned for about seven seconds. Both witnesses then saw a saucer shaped object approach southeast overhead at the same time and almost the same in altitude but at a speed which appeared faster than that of a commercial DC-6 still in the vicinity of the airport. The object had a wobbly sort of motion and a saucer like shape. It turned to the right, following the path of approaching aircraft and disappeared behind the hills. The witness is a Douglas engineer and states the object appeared at least as large if not larger than a DC-6.

3. Weather in the area at the time of sighting was clear with 10 miles visibility. Winds aloft at 5,000 feet rose 130° at 5 knots; 10,000 feet from 200° at 7 knots; 15,000 feet from 180° at 9 knots; 20,000 feet from 150° at 15 knots.

4. The xxxx are xxxx xxxx xxxx Los Angeles, California, telephone xxxxxxxxxx and an unidentified woman.

5. There were numerous planes flying in the vicinity of Burbank at the time of sighting. Burbank tower does not keep a log of their landings and take-offs therefore, an accurate check of air traffic could not be obtained.

Comments of Preparing Officers

1. Present employment of the witness indicates adequate aerial observer qualifications. Witness was not interrogated.

Teletype HNIBRIT 310652 July submitted by March Flight Service Center

An unidentified flying object consisting of an intense white-blue light in a cloud followed by the appearance of a saucer shaped object was observed as approximately 1235PST on 30 July 1952. The light burned for about seven seconds. The object had a wobbling sort of motion and was approximately three miles from the observation

posts mainly used by landing aircraft at Burbank, California. The object appeared to be at least as large if not larger than a DC-6.

The image presents several hand-drawn sketches, which appear to represent the same object from different perspectives or at different moments. There are sketches of disc-like shapes from a top view and side views. Additionally, there is a sequence of drawings that illustrate an object resembling a "classic" flying saucer with a central dome on top. One of the sketches seems to show the object in a wavy, oscillating motion. The text alongside the sketches suggests that the person who drew them is attempting to describe their observations of the object's appearance and behavior.

Here's the text as requested:

(all the same object)

I believe this
craft spins like
a gyroscope. One end
does not wobble.
Spinning would
account for
the pure white
pure light. Can
turn this light
on or off quickly.
Can hover or
speed away very
quickly (instantly).

Perhaps saucers
which rotate sharp
to turns are remote
controlled, while
others contain life-
forms, or otherwise,
and do not make
sharp turns.

It has often
dipped toward the
earth and
"skipped" out.

Ss Act
 from the side of the object at its greatest 
point of observing I judge that it was
about 100 ft in diameter and about 120
hdsk at the center. I base this on
the very large pines appearing of a similar
distance on the same bearing.

2) What I Observe;
The gliding, absence of the bright light seen
at both the front and rear, the speed
and the dark object - taking by
owning premises - and, pretty well 
enables me to liken, wings, reflections, 
headlights, similar occurrences are fallacies.

It is obvious to me that what I 
saw is the same type of craft which
[REDACTED] of Salem, Mich. the components
were reported on July 12, 1952 and the
same type of craft which was phenotypally
in [REDACTED]
[REDACTED] (spelled) and was featured
in one of their magazines.

I believe these came none from
another planet.

If they are not from another 
other planet, and are of some so

I sure would like to know where the existing
