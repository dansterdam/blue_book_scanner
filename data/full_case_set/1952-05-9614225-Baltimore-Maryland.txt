"There was no noticeable sound whatsoever, and this seemed strange and because the sight was quite still and sounds could be heard from the stadium, which is approximately 20 blocks away."
"We also watched several airliners in the following few minutes. All these planes could be heard distinctly normal."
Witness: C.R. - WEATHEROLT
"Original copy of above statement is on file in District Office #4 and will be referred to if needed."
Interview of Miss HELEN HAAS, reflects identically the same information as related by WEATHEROLT.
Review of flight records at 29th Infantry Division, Headquarters Battery, 222d Field Artillery Bn, reveal that U.S. Army planes, AT-6D's and L-17's, that were in the air May 27, 1952 from 2150 to 2350 hours and 2150 to 2250 hours, respectively, were identified by the TOWER and BOSS.
Interview of WEISHEIPT reflects that on 27 May 1952, at approximately 2230, CADWALADER and CAPT. GRAESER were flying a CADWALADER's T-6 aircraft. That their plane was apparently unidentified and aircraft was not in class and in motion was seen to go up and to the left and then dropped approximately 500 feet. On reaching the ground there were no landing lights on, but were a rather large white navigation light located on the bottom and green and red navigation lights were not working. His aircraft was an unoriented, unidentified T-6 aircraft.
After CADWALADER left his state of flying, he was simulating instrument flying. He had flown at approximately 500 feet at a speed of 100 mph. During this time he believes that he saw some unusual lights spotted by MORRIS. He described the weather as very clear and dark, with no moon.
OFFICIAL INDENTIFICATION was not determined from Friendship International Airport, is as follows:
Weather report from 27 May 1952:
2325 Hours: Clear, visibility 15 miles, surface wind southwest 5.
2357 Hours: Clear, visibility 10 miles, surface wind southwest 5.
CADWALADER was not available for interview at this time. He is taking examinations and attending graduation exercises.

WILLIAM SEERS, AF-22395762, 1413th Fighter Squadron, Harbor Field, charged of Custodian LEONARD JONES, 4017 Edmondson Ave., Baltimore, Maryland, had informed him on 27 May 1952 he had "seen those flying saucers."

AT BALTIMORE, MARYLAND:

1. LEONARD JONES, 4017 Edmondson Road, advised on 16 August 1952, at Baltimore, Maryland, Education - High School and Trade School, presently employed with Bendix Radio Division, Maryland, was interviewed on 27 May 1952 and stated that on 27 May 1952, between 2330 and 2345 hours, while sitting on his front porch with his wife, he observed two (2) large, bright white lights moving at a tremendous speed and immediately disappearing. He stated that the objects made no sound and seemed to change direction abruptly or zig-zag. This object had a peculiar characteristic of slowing down and speeding up. "These objects were much larger than usual aircraft lights" (estimated speed 300 miles per hour) and then increased in speed to "mail plane" (estimated speed 500 miles per hour) and then decreased in speed to a slow speed. There was no sound from the lights. He later decided that the two white lights were very round and were not similar to landing lights on aircraft. The distance between the lights did not vary. He stated the weather was very clear at the time of observation.

RICHARD BOSSE: a fellow employee at Bendix on the same night, but in a different part of Baltimore and at an earlier hour.

Interview of RICHARD ADAM BOSSE, 2914 Warnke Avenue, presently employed by Bendix Radio Division Maryland, on 27 May 1952 between 2230 and 2345 hours, he observed two unusual lights. A statement was obtained from BOSSE as follows:

Directions: Two large white lights appeared, low in the horizon, in a southeasterly direction. The lights looked similar to landing lights on airplanes. At first they appeared to be standing still, but they suddenly moved in a straight line and disappeared. These lights were like (green) lights on my car at a distance - just lights. The lights were 15 to 20 degrees out of the car. The lights separated, the one on my right veered upward and to the right and passed behind the second house. We observed it move rather slowly and at times seemed to float and "bob," though it was affected by air currents. It moved in an unnatural position, but when it passed behind the last house it was lost from sight.

The appearance was not comparable to anything I could explain. There seemed to be no form of a body, which should have been visible as a silhouette against the sky. The lights were as bright as though 1000 watts but seemed to have irregular pulsations or fluctuations as to intensity. The lights appeared and disappeared without any trail whatsoever. UNCLASSIFIED

SYNOPSIS: This is an initial report.

Investigation predicated on alleged sighting of unconventional aircraft on 27 May 1952. Two persons described an object seen between 2150 and 2220 hours, flying at a high rate of speed and altitude. The object was observed to reverse its direction and hover for about one (1) minute, then resume its high speed flight. No unusual sounds were heard. The person described the object as two (2) bright lights, one green and one red, moving in unison. Ballistics and technical examination of the area for night or sighting most discussed.
