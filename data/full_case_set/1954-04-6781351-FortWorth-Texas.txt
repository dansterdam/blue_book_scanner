It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a filled-out form with various information fields, such as the date, time, location, source, conclusion, and a brief summary and analysis of an observation. The text in the form indicates that the observation was of some unidentified aerial phenomenon that changed color from red to white to blue and back, and was observed around 2035 hours.

HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE 
OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS
District Office No. 23 - Carswell Air Force Base
Fort Worth, Texas

30 APR 1954

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

On 28 April 1954, MAC alerted the Base
Operations Officer at Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas
that radar had picked up an unknown object over Dallas, Texas.
The object made a rapid movement in a northeasterly direction
toward Fort Worth. The Base Operations Officer dispatched a
T-33 jet aircraft to investigate. The pilot made visual
contact with the object, described as round, white, and
30-40 feet in diameter, moving in a westerly direction at an
estimated speed of 500 knots. The object was at an
estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. The pilot chased the object
for several minutes but was unable to overtake it. The object
then accelerated and disappeared from view. The pilot stated
that the object was brighter than the sun, and its speed and
maneuverability were such that it could not be an aircraft of
known design.
