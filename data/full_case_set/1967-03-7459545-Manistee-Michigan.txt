PROJECT IC-673 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 27 MAR 52 - 1342Z
2. SOURCE: AF INTELLIGENCE
3. LOCATION: MANISTEE, MICHIGAN 
10. CONCLUSION: AERO-GASTRIAN (UNUSUAL)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched a group of several objects about the size of large birds or small airplanes for nearly 20 minutes. The objects were white, red and green, and appeared to be the color "reported by others" as observed during similar sightings in the area. The objects appeared to be moving and maneuvering in a somewhat erratic manner and one appeared to disappear and reappear in a different location. No physical evidence was found.
