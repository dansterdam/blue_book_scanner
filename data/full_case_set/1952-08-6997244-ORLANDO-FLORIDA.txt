The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Project 10073 record card from Project Blue Book, the US Air Force's official program for investigating Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) in the 1950s. The card is filled out with details about a UFO sighting that occurred on 5 Aug 52 in Orlando, Florida. The details include the type of observation (ground-visual), the number and type of objects observed (varied civilians), and a brief description of the sighting ("Silver ball-type object, appeared to hover when moved erratic").

PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14

1. This report covers the period from July 1948 through December 1952. During this period 3,201 sightings were reported to Project Blue Book.

2. Of the 3,201 sightings, 1,198 were considered unidentified. This represents 37.4 percent of the total.

3. The remaining 2,003 sightings, or 62.6 percent, were identified as having natural explanations, such as astronomical bodies, aircraft, balloons, birds, etc.

4. The characteristics most frequently associated with the unidentified sightings were:
(a) Unexplained maneuvers, e.g., sudden starting, stopping, and 90 degree turns.
(b) Unexplained speed, e.g., up to several thousand miles per hour.
(c) Unexplained configuration or shape, e.g., circular, elliptical, etc.
(d) Unexplained color, e.g., bright red, green, blue, etc.
(e) Unexplained lights, e.g., steady, blinking, etc.

5. Many of the unidentified sightings were made by highly reliable observers, such as aircraft pilots, control tower operators, and other technical personnel. A few of the sightings were made by more than one reliable observer.

6. The report concludes that a significant percentage of the sightings remain unexplained, and that these cannot be satisfactorily explained on the basis of a statistical study alone. The report recommends that further studies be made of the problem.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects, Captain, USAF, A/2-9370, Singapore, D.C.C.

PLACE: Singapore, Malaya
DATE: 5 August 1952

ORIGINATOR: Air Liaison Office, Singapore, D.C.C.

REPORT: Following article appeared in the Singapore Standard Newspaper on 5 August 1952:

SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS SPOTTED IN SINGAPORE SKY

At 7:40 P.M., they first saw a very bright round "globe" traveling from the direction of the sea towards the land. About two hours later, another similar object was seen again.

The Chinese resident said today that the "objects" travelled at a terrific speed without trail, smoke or sound. When he tried to look at it carefully, it disappeared.

Suddenly it disappeared before I could look at it carefully, he said.

Last Thursday evening, excitement was also caused in a near town when villagers there noticed a bright "strange" speeding across the sky.

The object was said to have radiated a bright greenish light and disappeared behind the hills near Bukit Timah.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: L.G.33400B Flying Training Wing
SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying Object
DATE: 3 August 1952
LOCATION: Orlando Air Force Base

Between 0700 and 1010 hours 3 August 1952, an unidentified object was observed over Orlando, Florida. Rosewald Park, Orlando, Florida.

The object appeared to be a solid silver ball, with no audible sound or visible means of propulsion. It was hovering and then moved at an estimated 5000 feet altitude. Object was in sight approximately ten minutes when it flew off to the northwest and disappeared.

At each sighting the object appeared to hover, with little or no lateral or vertical movement, and then leave the scene at a very high rate of speed.

Just prior to accelerating, the object appeared to slow, as though from intense heat.

On August 3 1952, the object was observed by Orlando, Fla. These observers confirmed the description and location of the object. It was not possible to identify the object.

At the time of sightings visibility was unlimited, with 7/10 coverage of cumulus clouds.

No interceptions were made and no photographs were taken.

The observers have had no previous experience in aircraft observation.

Alternate plans have been made to intercept the object if sighted again. However, no contact has been made and the object has not been seen during this period.

Text from the document:

type of observation was made again at about 2:00 p.m. on Aug. 6, 1952, over Orlando, Florida. The object was first observed as a bright light moving very rapidly in the sky, approaching from the southwest. It appeared to be traveling at an extremely high speed and made an abrupt turn to the right, moving across the sky at a very high speed. It then made an abrupt turn to the left and continued on generally northward until it disappeared from view. The object did not show any trail or leave any evidence of exhaust or propulsion system. Its maneuvers were very sharp and precise, and it appeared to be under intelligent control. Estimated height was approximately 20,000 to 30,000 feet. No sound was heard. No other objects were observed in the vicinity. The observation was made by ... and several other persons. The time of observation was from approximately 2:00 p.m. to 2:10 p.m. The object was observed through 7x50 binoculars. Investigation is continuing in an effort to determine the nature and identity of the object observed. 

The above report is respectfully submitted.
