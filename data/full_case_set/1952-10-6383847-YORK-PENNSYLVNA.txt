First of all, clarification of question 14.8: The three terms used do not apply specifically to the object reported, but they did give me pause to occasional reflection. They mentioned the object; ascended to vertically while in flight; a side to side pendulum movement but on a short arc.

As the distance I was from it, it could have been very large or very high up a thousand feet or less. Question 20.1 if it was very large it could have been flying at several thousand feet or more. Question 20.2 What would the light be, say five or six thousand feet up, conditions could affect its appearance? (Answer 20.1)

Question 20.3 If it were the size of a Piper Cub it was flying at approximately 90 to 100 miles per hour, provided that it was flying above a thousand feet. This particular selection then it had to flying high and at a high speed to remain in my vision as long as it did.

Question 20.4 since all of the above is conditional I can only add that I am certain of having seen the object flying under the above conditions.

In general, the object observed appeared rounded and as it passed from my view, it did not appear to have a gaseous halo about it, nor did it seem to have a thing, more than a light-train around it. There were no other lights about it either (red and green or other running lights). It was just a solid, yellow orange orb. In conclusion, this is all I can really say in positive observation; 16. This is not what I would rate as an unusual sighting, however, sounds were equally absent. In actual seen under similar circumstances would have been more positive.

SUMMARY: Civilian observer reported observing an unidentified flying object. The object was described as bright silver in color and moved at a high rate of speed. It was visible for approximately 1-2 minutes.

The observer stated that he heard no sound from the object. The object followed a level flight path, but appeared to accelerate rapidly as it climbed and disappeared from view. According to the observer, the object was not a balloon, airplane, or other known aerial vehicle.

This case offers no definite explanation of the sighting. The observer appears to be a credible witness, but without additional information, a positive identification of the object cannot be made.

Guard Intelligence Division, U.S. Coast Guard Station, Boston, Mass.,
are interrogated by Special Agent WILLIAM F. ROELL, USAF and identified the
witnesses as follows:

a. GLOUCESTER Life Boat Station, M 2/c FLOYES
b. Straitsmooth Life Boat Station, Rockport, Mass.
c. Race Point Coast Guard Station, Provincetown, Mass.
d. Coast Guard Cutter "Yankton" 
Lieutenant WILLIAM M. JEANOTTE stated that no record was made of the report from the fishing craft off Gloucester from this object, since it was not definable and could not be investigated further. The Coast Guard Lifeboat Registry lists one craft named the "Charles G. Shilley" which is further identfied only as a Fishing Boat with some port at New Bedford, Mass.

On 15 October 1952, JOSEPH LT is/o LT 2/c USCO and questioned on 16 October 1952.
Viewed by Special Agent DANFORTH P. RICE, on 16 October 1952, Case continued telephonically by Special Agent BOWLING in Washington.

By his description the object sighted was described as being spherical in shape, lighted with a short exhaust or tail section, giving the overall impression of a clear shape.

It appeared the object sighted by him to be a football with a short trail of the rear. He added that after the object passed, the trail was not distigning but traned the object for a short distance and then disappeared. His overall impression was that of a bright yellowish light.

A long cigar with a brilliant whitish light in front and bulish vapor trail, which appeared to the crew, giving the impression of a gun with the whitish end toward the front.
Interviewers could not determine the exact nature of the object they sighted, but stated that there was no change in altitude or direction, and that they observed a vapor trail or exhaust, other than described above. The sound on the object was uniformly described by interviewees as "tremendously fast" or "such faster than a jet aircraft."
Object north to south, no variation in altitude, and no maneuvers of any kind noted. The object was traveling south to north and seemed to gain altitude just before it disappeared.
14 October 1952. Crew which sighted the object at 2020 hours E.S.T. by his own watch, from Provincetown, Mass., and observed it for an estimated minute (1) seconds.
Object at 2:23 hours according to the Crew "Closeup Station" on 14 October 1952. He estimated the duration of sighting as six (6) seconds.
The object from the Sandwich Life Boat Station at Gloucester at 2025 hours was "adding north," indicating the same object, and seemed to gain altitude just before it disappeared in four (4) seconds.
The object was sighted by the Coast Guard Station at Race Point, near Provincetown, Mass., at 2013 hours and estimated the duration of sighting as one (1) minute.
According to his own watch the object described by him at 1640 hours "ranged from the Coast Guard Station of Provincetown, New Hampshire, approximately 22 miles east of Provincetown," and stopped after three (3) seconds.
Sighting was by visual observation with no optical or electronic aids. A No. 7.50 Navy type pilot's binoculars were used by the individual who sighted the object through the optic sight, according to the crew.

3. Identifying information on observers: J. J. Couroy, Coast Guard, Boston, Mass., 32 yrs. of age, and was employed as an Aeronautical electronios Technician. He advised that he has done considerable photographic and astronomical work with all types of cameras, and stated that although he has seen falling stars, he had never observed anything similar to the object described.

Lt. D. H. Preble, U. S. Coast Guard, 30 yrs. of age, has been in the U. S. Coast Guard for (3) years. According to his statement, he considers himself very familiar with both jet and conventional aircraft, but he has never seen anything comparable to the object described.

"Size in relation to a DC-3 aircraft (wing span 95 ft), appeared to be about 1/4 to 1/3 the size of a DC-3 aircraft, and advised that he has some knowledge of aircraft identification, that he has never seen any type of aircraft comparable to the object described by him to be distinctly different from anything he has ever observed before.

Race Point, Provincetown, Mass., is 31 yrs. of U.S. Coast Guard station, and has been in the Coast Guard for the (3) years. He also positively identified the object to be distinctly different from anything seen before.

Stated that the object described by him was different from anything he has ever observed, the convinced him that it was not a shooting star or a meteor, because while he observed was appeared to be a constant source of light and seemed to come straight across the sky in a horizontal direction, a shooting star generally falls downward and has an intense but transitory burst and intensity. He now regards the phenomena as a new development in the realm of air defense.

Weather conditions: Perfect clear at the time of the sighting, temperature indaicate, visibility unlimited, wind 10 mph, barometer 30.12, temperature 55 degrees.

Gentlemen:

After completion of the copy of the enclosed report I find another from a clipping from an amateur report in Bronx, N.Y. which indicates that the object in question was a brilliant meteor or fireball. 

According to Fitts, F.M.F.E.S., "this indicates that it was undoubtedly a meteor and could not have been the object described by you. He gives colors as red, white, green, duration 2 to 5 seconds, no explosions or sound."

He saw it over Massachusetts. I could confirm this observation. Said it covered most of the sky.

Under Zodiacal light and meteor observations, said it followed.

He further drew the picture.

In view of these two good reports, there is absolutely no doubt that the object in question was not artificial, but was simply a brilliant meteor or bolide. If you wish the technical term for an exploding fireball.

Very truly,

[Signature redacted]
Director

Unidentified or unknown flying object sighted
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Dear Sirs,

Re: The Technical Information Center, Directorate of Intelligence, Headquarters of the United States Air Force, Washington 25, D.C.

Concerning this unidentified flying object as clarified and promulgated on 28 September 1952, the object in question was first sighted at 12:43 a.m., Eautern Standard Time, on 6 October 1952 near York, Pennsylvania. The object was observed for approximately 2 1/2 minutes. It was described as a single bright light, silvery in color, and oval in shape. The object was traveling in a straight and level course at a high rate of speed. It was first observed in the southeast and disappeared in the northwest, covering a distance of approximately 30 miles. The total duration of the sighting was approximately 2 1/2 minutes.

All the observers agreed that the object looked like a long cigar with a brilliant white light in the center, and that its course was 225 degrees, and that it varied "tremendously fast".

Additionally and at approximately the same time, a military flight check was made, and several fighter planes from an air force base in the area were observed taking off, but there was no contact or interception of the unidentified flying object.

Your report of astronomical activity tends to believe that what the object sighted was, in reality, some natural phenomenon, and therefore, there is a strong possibility that the item does not fall into the category of unidentified. However, the time, location, speed, and maneuver of the object are not typical of known natural phenomena, and the report is hereby submitted for your analysis.

We must have the observer's name, the place from which the object was sighted, the position of the observer's station must be given (latitude and longitude), the direction in which the object was moving, the time at which it appeared, and the hour and minute when the object appeared itself, the determination of its size by comparison, if possible, meaning an angular measurement in degrees or mils if at all possible, and the height or two altitudes. "the Painter" of the Big Dipper are five degrees long. Neither will help in estimating a distance in degrees. Warning should be here given that the use of miles, yards, feet, or inches to describe the heights or lengths of paths of meteors is not possible meaning and the words used do not convey a definite meaning and the words used do not convey a definite meaning. It is always useful to give the angle of the path - in degrees which the meteor was going. The object's speed should be compared with that of the full Moon or some planet or bright star. Here again the use of "inches" in describing diameters has absolutely no meaning, nor has the comparison of the meteor with the diameter of the Moon, the duration of flight in seconds, and if an explosion is seen, one should state carefully how many minutes or seconds elapsed before the explosion was heard. This is an excellent check on other observations. If the object is seen in daylight, exactly the same observations should be made, except that here it is impossible to use the stars as reference points. In all cases additional motion, etc., are useful. Any report which has only part of the desired data may be very valuable; please send us everything noted about the fireball, whether it is much or little. Your observations may include just the one point lacking in reports from other people, and we may make possible a solution of the heights and orbit.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a table listing various annual meteor showers, including their name, duration in days, date of maximum, and hourly number of meteors seen.

ANNUAL METEOR SHOWERS

For the information of the casual observer the following data concerning the principal annual meteor showers are given. For leap years the dates should be one day earlier than those listed here. All dates are shown of the evening on which the maximum is due, even though the shower may appear after midnight and therefore on the following calendar date. For the midnight and therefore on the following calendar date. For the midnight and therefore on the following calendar date. For the average year the Perseids are the richest stream, followed in order by the Geminids and Orionids. The American Meteor Society is always glad to receive accurate hourly counts of meteors made by persons on any of the nights when annual streams are active.

Dear Sirs: 

The Air Technical Intelligence Center is in receipt of a bulletin on an UFO sighting described in your letter of 14 October 1952 in the York, Pennsylvania area. Our own report concerning this sighting indicates a few differences in the particulars. However, the following items may be of interest:

1. The object is described as having a brilliant, slightly bluish-white light which was observed on four occasions, each lasting from 10 to 15 minutes.
2. The object was first sighted at about 8:00 PM on 6 October 1952 southwest of York, Pennsylvania.
3. The object was observed to move in various erratic manners, hovering, accelerating rapidly and maintaining constant altitude. It would appear and disappear at will.
4. All the observers agreed that the object looked like a "lens-shaped" craft with a brilliant white light in front and a similar trail at the rear. 
5. Additionally, and at approximately the same time, an unidentified flying object was observed over Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which was described as appearing to be larger than the object seen over York.
6. The report indicates that the object seen at Harrisburg may have been the same object seen over York, due to the proximity of the two locations.
It seems probable that the object seen at Harrisburg, Pennsylvannia, and the one described in your letter are the same, inasmuch as the descriptions and behavior are similar. However, in the attached report, the object seen over York appears to be definitely the one described in your letter.
Your report of astronomical activity lends us to believe that the first group of observers really saw the brilliant meteor or fireball reported in your statement for 14 October.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and indicate the direction the object was moving.

WHICH I CAN HARDLY TO THE CLUSE

I CAN NOVOE, THERE WAS A CONTINUOUS LIGHT TO IT, SORT OF A METALLIC GROWING SOMETHING, BUT NOT BURNING.

SECTION B

26. Was this the first time that you have seen an object like this? (Circle one): YES NO

26.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what conditions did you see other cases?

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it? It was obviously not a meteor because it was in a level flight and not descending rapidly. I suppose for want of a better explanation it could have been a disc of some kind, but it was not a reflection as it was clearly defined brilliantly visible at the same time to the southwest of the point of sighting, and remained there for something of the order of 10 or 15 minutes.

28. Give the following information about yourself:
