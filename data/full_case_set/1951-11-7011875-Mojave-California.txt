Biographical information redacted
Preliminary report of objects observed being flying over Mojave, California on November 7, 1951.
I reported observing several objects maneuvering in the sky over Mojave, California on November 7, 1951 at approximately 7:30 PM PST.
The objects were metallic in appearance and appeared to be flying at an extremely high rate of speed in formation. I was unable to determine their exact size, shape or altitude, but they seemed to be flying at a very high altitude. They were visible for only a brief period of time before disappearing from view.
I immediately reported the sighting to the nearest military installation. This report is submitted in accordance with current directives regarding the reporting of unidentified flying objects.
