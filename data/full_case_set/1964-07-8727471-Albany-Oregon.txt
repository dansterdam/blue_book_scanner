BOLIDE OF 1964 JULY 19. A.M.S. No. 2384
BY CHARLES F. OLIVIER
Narberth, Pennsylvania

Over sixty visual observations of an unusually bright bolide, sighted over British Columbia on July 19, 1964, 0:44 p.m. P.S.T., have been analyzed to determine the approximate parabolic path of the object.

SOMMAIRE

Plus de soixante observations visuelles d'un bolide particulierement brillant apercu dans le ciel de la Colombie Britannique le 19 juillet, 1964 a 0:44 p.m. heure normale du Pacifique, ont ete analysees pour determiner la trajectoire parabolique approximative de l'objet.

ON July 19, 1964, at 0:44 p.m. P.S.T., an unusually brilliant bolide was sighted over British Columbia and, moving in a general south-easterly direction, ended over Washington. Mr. R. F. Rogan, regional director for the American Meteor Society, began collecting numerous reports from Canadians and others in the Washington area. Eventually these were all sent to the writer, who belatedly attempted to calculate the path. However, it became evident that sighting reports from Canada would vastly assist in the solution, hence the writer applied to Dr. W. M. Millman of the Meteor Centre, National Research Council, Ottawa, for assistance. Dr. Millman's reports, as well as a drawing of the preliminary projected path, derived by Prof. R. E. Slawson, University of British Columbia, Canada, from observations he had collected. Three reports were received from the RCMP with various degrees of accuracy and were utilized first and last observed positions and azimuth lines were drawn for the directions in which the bolide was first and last observed from each station. As always there were great discrepancies in the angles given, ranging 40° 15' N., saw it begin at a Ursae Majoris and cross over ▵ Aquillae-actually it went much further. This observation gave fundamental points on the path and a very fine projected path since it passed almost through the zenith. Several other Canadians saw it near their homes and one reported it to be very low over the trees.

The sub-end point was based mostly on American reports and a large proportion of these gave estimated on Astronomical Research, Vol. 59, No. 6

This bolide has been assigned by the Society.
The writer expresses his misgivings regarding the thirty-second duration of flight, which, he states, have been very uncertain with Boogar, whose personal view in many previous reports, and the U.S. Air Force more than do indivisible observers about to report; without such co-operation is impossible.

BOLIDE OF 1964 JULY 19, A.M.S. NO. 2384
By CHARLES F. OLIVIER
Narberth, Pennsylvania
ABSTRACT
Over sixty visual observations of an unusually bright, long-lived, sighted over the northwestern U.S. on July 19, 1964, 9:44 p.m., P.S.T., have been analysed to determine the approximate trajectory path of the object.
SOMMAIRE
Plus de soixante observations visuelles d'une boule de feu brillante et long-vécue, aperçue sur le nord-ouest des Etats-Unis le 19 juillet 1964, à 9 h 44 p.m., H.P.E., ont été analysées pour déterminer la trajectoire approximative de l'objet.
ON July 19, 1964, at 9:44 p.m. P.S.T., an unusually bright bolide was sighted over southwestern Alberta and moving in a general south-easterly direction, ended over western Missouri. Dr. F. R. Hogan, regional director for the American Meteor Society, began collecting reports at once from observers and correspondents in Washington. Eventually these were sent to the writer, who belatedly attempted to calculate the path of the bolide. To assist in this sighting report, Dr. A. Millman of the National Research Centre, Ottawa, was asked for assistance.
From the sighting reports, the path derived by Prof. W. F. Sawyer, University of British Columbia, Canada, from observations he had discussed, have been utilized. These reports were received from the U.S. Air Force and vary in the degree of completeness available. The path and limits of the region, and the lines drawn for the directions in which the bolide was first and last observed, are shown. As always there are great divergencies but fortunately the Canadian observer at Union River Logging camp, W. J. Delaforce at 47 N, gave a good determination of the radiant and a very fine projected path since it passed very near his position. Several other Canadians saw it near their zeniths and could tell on which side it passed. These observations confirmed the above projected path. The final print was based mainly on American reports and a large proportion of these were fairly estimative.
