The provided image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads as follows:

Re: 11/Sept/68, Green Bay, Wisconsin

There are several other possibilities. A satellite is also likely, or a specially lighted aircraft. A genuine UFO phenomenon is also a possibility. From data given, it is impossible to decide which is the more likely. As a guess, I'd say satellite.
