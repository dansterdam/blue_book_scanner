The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Project Blue Book record card from January 1956 regarding a sighting in Long Beach, Long Island, New York. The sighting lasted for 20 minutes and was described as a smoke trail that appeared to be falling and moving NNE, and looked like the 1st phase of 1/4 moon. The observer reported that it disappeared with setting of sun. The conclusions section indicates that it was possibly a balloon.

The SOURCE estimated the object to be at an angle of elevation of 30°.

At the time of the sighting the sun was located low in the west, with the object being between the observer and the sun, creating the effect as seen in the SOURCE's sketch of the object on page 3 of this report.

I. SOURCE:   Address: ...., Atlantic Beach, Long Island, New York
Age: 42
Occupation: Summer Resort Operator 
Education: High School
Qualifications: None
II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was a mature, level-headed, well-to-do businessman and had a good reputation in his community. He had felt he should file this report, but was worried about receiving any publicity over the matter. At no time did SOURCE indicate that he had received a saucer or other interpla-netary craft, but felt compelled to report certain observations and events that had taken place before his eyes. At no time did the SOURCE tend to exaggerate or embellish the details involved nor did he indicate any contradictions in his statements.
III. DETAILS OF DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was driving home at 18:30 on 7 Apr 56 on Beach St., in a westerly direction. About four miles from home he noticed that a bright object low on the horizon had attracted his attention. Once more however it had changed its position from vertical to horizontal. Once more it gave him the impression that it was slowing down and speeding up as if it were under intelligent control. At one point it appeared to be an entirely different position he became concerned and stopped his car to observe it more closely. From this position it appeared to be an elongated oval or circular in shape and was luminous, emitting a blue-white light. It appeared to be about 20 miles away at a heading of about 275 degrees. It was about the size of a fifty-cent piece held at arm's length and that it was about 20 miles away at a heading of about 275 degrees. It was about the size of a fifty-cent piece held at arm's length. He estimated the object to be some 40 to 60 feet in diameter. He was said to have given the impression of being well versed, but that his voice appeared to tremble slightly. It gave SOURSE the impression that the object was white and brighter than the background sky and since it remained visible for some 10-12 minutes until it disappeared. SOURSE were glasses and made his observation with 10x50 binoculars through the rearview mirror of his automobile. all movement was erratic that it may have been under intelligent control. He did not notice any celestial bodies at the time of the sighting. He stated that he appeared to be about 3 or 4 miles away from the object and that the duration of the sighting was about 10-12 minutes. SOURSE gave the impression of a commercial and professional man.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
1. A check was made with the Filter Center at White Plains, New York, which has not reports of the same area at the same time. 
2. A check was made with the Base Operations Section of Mitchell AFB, New York,  and the records of this AO reveal no reports.
3. A check with the Stewart AFS Weather Office revealed that on the afternoon of 14 Jan 56, the sky conditions were clear and the winds were as follows:

LEVEL        DIRECTION       VELOCITY
1,000 to 5,000 feet        180 degrees      15 to 30 knots
5,000 to 10,000 feet       360 degrees      30 knots
10,000 to 15,000 feet      360 degrees      35 knots
15,000 to 20,000 feet      330 degrees      50 knots
20,000 to 25,000 feet      330 degrees      55 knots
25,000 to 30,000 feet      330 degrees      75 knots

Considering the wind factors above, the only stations in the area surrounding the reflecting object(s) are those of RAOB's at Albany, New York; Buffalo, New York and Mitchell AFP, New York. These balloons are released daily at 0000Z and 1200Z. 
4. Contact with the Coast Guard Station located at Montauk Point, Long Island, New York, and the Flanders Market, Long Island, New York, revealed that no flights were made in their areas on 14 Jan 56.
5. A check with Newsday, the Garden City, Long Island newspaper, revealed that a woman has called and reported an object in the sky at the same time; however, no name or address was given - the paper stated that it appeared to be a reflection and that it hovered and then disappeared.

COMMENTS OF Preparing Officer:
1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the sighting might have been caused by weather balloons released from Long Island, New York at GFOC since the reported velocities were insufficient to transport the object the required distance in the 40 minutes elapsed from the time of the sighting at 23:00Z and the time of the balloon release at 21:02Z.

2. The north and north-westerly winds tend to rule out, but the probability of balloon originating at Mitchell APB, which lies about 25 miles northeast of the location of the sighting.

WILLIAM J SAUCOKI 
Lt Colonel, USAF
Officer in Charge

COMMENTS OF Approving Officer: 
1. The following additional information was revealed by the Investigating Officer:
a. Piball balloons are released at 0000Z, 0900Z, 1200Z, and 2100Z daily from both civil and military locations in the New York City area, including Idlewild Airports release this type balloon at the above times.
b. Piball balloons under some conditions do not indicate correct balloon color depending upon sky conditions at the time of release. On a clear day as was 18 Jan 56 in the New York area, piball balloons would have been white.

2. It is the opinion of this headquarters that this sighting is explained by piball balloons released at Idlewild Airport (New York City area) at 1800Z on 17 January 1956. The following items are given in support of the above hypothesis:
a. Idlewild Airport is located fifteen (15) miles north-northeast of the SOURCES home. Winds at the time of the sighting were from the north and northwest as indicated at 15/2000Z.
b. At 2102Z, the time of the sighting and forty (40) minutes after the release of the piball from Idlewild, it has followed an approximate course that the subject balloon would have been approximately eight (8) miles west of the observer and at an altitude of 22,000 feet.
c. From the above figures we can obtain the angle of elevation of the balloon since its location is known.
