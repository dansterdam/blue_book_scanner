Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

Both Myself And Mr. [redacted] were keeping 
a close watch on the balloon. I observed first two objects
in formation - Very quickly they were joined by four
others. The five objects were observed to join formation
in trail behind the leader. They appeared very quickly
and joined this trail formation. While in formation they
were spaced very evenly. When I saw three of the
objects I asked Mr. [redacted] what he could see.
He saw exactly what I did. [redacted] While he was watching 
I took pictures with a 16 mm Bolex with a 6" Telephoto 
lens. As I was taking pictures the objects moved
slowly under the balloon and to a due direction. Very
suddenly the objects seemed to go straight up at
right angles to their level flight position. They
remained in perfect trail formation and seemed to
"peel or break" straight up at terrific speed and
disappear.

In my opinion these were not reflections from
the aircraft wind shield nor were they reflections from
the balloon. The sky was a clear deep blue and the
objects . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The objects I feel were
almost . . . . . . . . must have been clear though I did not have
time to adjust the f stops properly.

2 North Mianus
School Boys Tell
Of Seeing 'Saucer'

The story of two North Mianus school pupils who swear they saw a "flying saucer" was revealed by the witnesses yesterday.
The story witnesses are Waldo Merrill, 11 yr old Ray Rd., and his neighbor and pal, Roy Mather. Waldo came flying into the house the other night breathless, scared, and white as a sheet.
"He told his mother he and Roy saw a flying saucer over the Mianus Res. 
"I knew he saw something. He tops wouldn't even go making up. He forgets.
"He saw for cookies later, and worried, my ideas, couldn't," Mr.
does."
Roy and Waldo came down to the the Mianus Res. about 7:45 p.m. last Saturday. They had been skating. Waldo started to explain.
"I saw it coming from the direction of the reservoir. Both boys identified the flew saucer. Green-colored, silvery and apparently much larger left and toward North Mianus," the boys averred.
"What that, partially blocked rivals, each other, Waldo stopped lacing.
The pair watched in awe as the heart-shaped flying object neared below with a saucer."

looked. It must have been a couple holes in the saucer shining like stars," Roy reported.
Waldo said "the saucer did not shine on the ice or cause any shadows.
The two boys said they watched the saucer for about three minutes, getting water they believe it was so high.
"That's why they told their father they."
Waldo threw off his loose skate — put his shoe back on, and scrammed.
"I set a new world's record when I ran to the house," Waldo admitted.
Roy stopped playing to the main curb. His house. He turned for answer.
Both boys at their house heard about the other loud buzzer sound and had gone to the ice on the exposed. Roy's said, his statements directly.
Roy nose: "Green-color, no signs of he saw a flying saucer."
Waldo's parents told her, trying to find out what it was.
"I don't believe you saw the saucer. Don't change your mind because people kid you." They said. The focus shifting in the doors are sure. Most boys saw a flying ice saucer the two agreed that it mustn't come from Mars.
"It's probably the Army or Navy testing some radio-controlled device," was Mr. and Mrs. Merrill think. They had fancied a television alloy on flying when the theory which was mentioned the learned play that the armed forces are the great source of the strange mania.
