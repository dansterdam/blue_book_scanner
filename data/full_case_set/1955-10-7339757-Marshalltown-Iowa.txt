The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a Project 10073 Record Card from the Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The card provides details about a sighting that occurred on 2% Oct 55 in Marshalltown, Iowa. The sighting was described as "Visual" and the "Source" was listed as "Civilian". The "Brief Summary of Sighting" mentions that a "large white object" was seen at arm's length, and the observer possibly described it as a balloon launched from General Mills. The "Conclusions" section indicates the sighting was "Possibly sighting generated by balloon launched from General Mills Inc." and was "Insufficient data for evaluation".
