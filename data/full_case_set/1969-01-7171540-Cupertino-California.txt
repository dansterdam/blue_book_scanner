Text extracted from the document:

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE
THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM PERSONS WHO HAVE OBSERVED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFOS) OR OTHER UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA. THE INFORMATION OBTAINED WILL BE USED FOR RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS BY THE OFFICE OF AEROSPACE RESEARCH, USAF. YOUR COOPERATION IN COMPLETING THIS QUESTIONNAIRE AND RETURNING IT TO AIR FORCE BASE INVESTIGATOR FOR FORWARDING TO ATIC IS REQUESTED. WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO 45433, WILL ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF YOUR QUESTIONNAIRE.
1. WHEN DID YOU SEE THE PHENOMENA? DAY 4 MONTH January YEAR 1969
2. WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENA? HOUR 2 MINUTES 15 A M P M
3. WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENA? HOUR 7 MINUTES 10 A M P M
4. TIME ZONE: EASTERN CENTRAL MOUNTAIN PACIFIC STANDARD OTHER

A HAND DRAWN MAP WHERE YOU WERE STANDING WITH REFERENCE TO THE ADDRESS IF IN THE COUNTRY, IDENTIFY THE LANDMARK YOU USED TO ARRIVE NEAR AND SAY TO WHAT PART OF THE RESIDENCE OR BUILDING THE PHENOMENA WERE VISIBLE.

This would be a relatively out of a residential area. The phenomena was about 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon and approximately 3 to 5 miles distant. It was a discernible object of considerable size, shaped somewhat like a manta ray, with lights of varying intensity visible along its perimeter.

IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH. PLACE AN "X" ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH THE PHENOMENA WERE ABOVE THE HORIZON. PLACE A "Y" ON THE SAME CURVE TO SHOW THE ANGULAR DISTANCE FROM YOU TO THE PHENOMENA.

The image contains three illustrations. The top illustration is a compass rose with 16 directional points. The middle illustration depicts a person standing on a road surrounded by hills or mountains. The bottom illustration shows a similar landscape, but with a smaller person figure.

6A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A CIRCLE AROUND THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THE PHENOMENON AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE. INDICATE, WITH A LINE, THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON IN RELATION TO THE OTHER OBJECTS USED FOR COMPARISON. EXAMPLE: YOUR OWN FIGURE COULD BE USED AS A SCALE FOR THE LARGER SKETCH.
