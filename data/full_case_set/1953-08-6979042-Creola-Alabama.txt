Transcribed text from the document:

Investigation report
Investigator: Donald S. Keyhoe Major, USAF (Ret.)
Location: Creola, Alabama
Date: August 6, 1953
Incident: At approximately 1000 GCT, on 21 July 1953, the object was sighted and investigated.

The following observations were reported by the observers:

On 21 July 1953 at approximately 1000 GCT, two citizens of Creola, Alabama were observing the sky from their home when they noticed a bright metallic object in the sky at an estimated altitude of about 3000 feet. The object was traveling in a general westerly direction at a high rate of speed. The object was visible through the windshield of an automobile for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The object appeared to be circular in shape and about the size of a quarter held at arm's length. The object was observed to make an abrupt 90 degree turn and continue on in a generally northerly direction at the same high rate of speed. The observers stated that the object was completely silent and left no visible trail. The location of the observers at the time was approximately 30 minutes west of Creola, Alabama.

Later on 21 July 1953, members of the USAF Radar Laboratory in New York, New York were questioned regarding the above sighting. The personnel stated that no unusual radar targets had been detected in the Creola, Alabama area.

The Investigator's opinion based on the investigation is that the object sighted was not an aircraft or a weather balloon. The facts that the object made an abrupt 90 degree turn and was traveling at a high rate of speed, coupled with the lack of any sound or trail, tend to rule out a conventional aircraft or weather balloon. The Investigator is unable to offer any definite explanation as to the nature of the object observed. It is possible that the object was some type of unconventional aircraft or other aerial phenomenon. The Investigator recommends that the case be filed for further study and investigation should additional information become available.

SIGHTING OF
CREOLA, ALABAMA

On 1 August 1953 at 20:30 PM local time, I was just getting into my automobile when I noticed something in the sky. I called out to my wife, "Lo, there is the space side of "way up heading in a zig zag direction." I could not make out any shape to it and the only thing I noticed was the color of the light. It appeared to be glowing a reddish color in the center and had a reddish glow surrounding it. It was traveling very rapidly and the direction appeared to be straight and level.

It was traveling higher than any aircraft I have ever seen and the whole duration of the sighting was approximately 5 to 10 seconds. There was no sound associated with the sighting. It seemed fairly large in size. There was no aircraft anywhere in the area at the time of the sighting. It appeared to be going in a straight and level flight.

Headquarters Office
Second Air Force, Alabama

The attention of the observers is called to the incident described herein. The observers were instructed that they should not identify any individuals or persons in the case of their observance as the witnesses. There was no description of any individuals made in this case.

On 17 August 1952 at 2355 hours local time, two observers reported observing a bright, orange-colored object moving slowly from the north to the south. They estimated the size of the object to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter and 8 to 10 feet thick, elliptical in shape. Both observers agreed that this object was silent, and at the time of the sighting was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet and traveling at a speed of approximately 150 to 200 miles per hour. The object was observed for a period of approximately 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing to the south.

No interrogation was attempted since the sightings were late in being reported. 

The weather is reported as in Inclosure #7.
