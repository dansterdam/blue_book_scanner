9. FURTHER COMMENTS
Radar and visual sighting. Small object on radar. Full and the same color as the background lighting. It seemed to move rapidly and then hover for a short time and then disappear.
10. CONCLUSIONS
Size of the object was reported to be very small. The ground radar made a positive detection and at the same time it was visually observed. The ground radar was not operating in the area at the time it would have been normally. The movement and disappearance of the object was erratic to say the least, appearing to be under intelligent control. There was absolutely no explanation for the sighting.

Sept 17, 1961

Reported on October 12, 1961. My husband and I were looking out of a window in our home about 9:30 p.m. when we saw a bright light moving in the western sky. At first we thought it was a plane, but it was moving much faster than any plane we had ever seen. It appeared to be oblong in shape and red in color. As it moved it seemed to change shape, sometimes appearing round, other times oblong. It moved in a zig-zag fashion, then would stop momentarily, then dart off in another direction. The speed with which it moved was incredible. After watching it for about 2 or 3 minutes, it suddenly disappeared. We have never seen anything like it before and have racked our brains trying to figure out what it could have been. We are both very level-headed and certainly not prone to imagining things. This was a definite, unexplained phenomenon which we observed with our own eyes. I would be very interested to know if anyone else in this area observed the same thing at about the same time.

Text from the document:

"When I awoke that morning shortly before 6:00 AM I had one of the most unusual and unpleasant experiences of my life. My sleep the past few nights had been fitful and disturbed, and this morning was no exception. I awoke with a feeling of great oppression and dread, and I seemed to have only partial control of my physical faculties. I felt heavy and sluggish, as though my body was not my own. As I became more fully awake, I tried to shake off this strange feeling, but it persisted. I looked around the room and everything seemed normal. The curtains were drawn, letting in some daylight, and the furnishings were exactly as I had left them the previous evening. My wife, sleeping soundly beside me, seemed undisturbed.

Suddenly, a wave of strange sensations came over me. I felt an urge to get up and go to the window. I hesitated, puzzled by this impulse, but something seemed to be drawing me there. As I approached the window, I became aware of a flickering glow outside. Looking out, I was startled to see a large, luminous object hovering silently just above the tree line, perhaps a hundred yards distant. It was disc-shaped, and seemed to be rotating slowly. Dazzling beams of light were flashing from its surface in all directions.

I stared at the object in amazement, unable to comprehend what I was seeing. Glued to the window, I watched as it began to rise slowly, the flashing lights still playing about its surface. As it ascended, it gradually increased in speed until, in a matter of seconds, it had disappeared from view. I rubbed my eyes, wondering if I had been dreaming. But the strange sensations I had experienced, and the sight of the object itself, were far too vivid to have been imaginary.

I dressed quickly and went outside to see if there were any clues or evidence of what I had witnessed. But the area was completely quiet and normal, with no sign that anything out of the ordinary had occurred. Troubled and perplexed, I returned to the house, my mind full of unanswered questions."

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or man's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the hand of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give us a clear picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
