Transcription of the text in the document:

August 6, 1964

I am writing this report in regards to what I saw on this date. I am sorry to bother you with this report, but I feel that it is necessary to inform you of what I saw. It was a bright and saucer-shaped object that was hovering approximately 150 feet above the ground. I first noticed it while driving down the highway. It appeared to be metallic in color and was spinning slowly. It seemed to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. 

As I got closer, I could see it more clearly. It was a metallic, saucer-shaped object that was hovering motionless above the ground. I watched it for several minutes, and it did not move or make any sound. I was quite startled by what I saw, and I immediately pulled over to the side of the road to get a better look at it.

As I was watching it, the object suddenly accelerated straight up at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. I have never seen anything like this before, and I am not sure what to make of it. I am reporting this to you in the hope that you may be able to provide some explanation or insights into what I witnessed.

out of sight, this object started moving towards the end of the wood and I felt It must be a strange object as It was making a sound
I did only let It go t very look as though it went throgn it as it was a complete stop for about 10 minutes and then disappeared very suddenly.
There are no photographs of this report, but the text describes an unidentified object that was observed moving through the woods and then disappearing suddenly.

August 30, 1964

Dear Mr. -----,

This is in response to your recent letter in which you reported observing an unidentified flying object on August 26, 1964.

As you observed, this observation was undoubtedly an aircraft. You described it as a bright light in the sky which moved rapidly. This is a common observation of aircraft.

While we appreciate your reporting this observation, the Air Force has concluded that the above explanation will most likely account for the sighting.

Sincerely,

M. H. JACOBI
Major, USAF

Office of Information

Celina, Ohio
