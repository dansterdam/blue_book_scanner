The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" marked on it, and a "B" on the same curved line. This sketch is meant to illustrate how the object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it, and how high the object was above the horizon.

The second and third sketches are larger and depict a landscape scene. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road, with a curved horizon line and mountains or other structures in the background. The third sketch shows a similar landscape, but from a different perspective, with a person standing in the foreground and the horizon and landscape features in the background.

The text:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

(SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and ended as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may include past information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches which you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observed event as completely and accurately as possible, and if any other papers are attached, indicate that fact here.

NAME: (Do Not Write in This Space)

DATE: 9-22-59

As described in the questionnaire, I was in my backyard at around dusk on 9-22-59 when I observed a large, disc-shaped object hovering silently in the sky. It was brightly lit and seemed to give off some kind of a glow. At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it made no sound and was completely motionless. After watching it for a few minutes, the object suddenly shot upward at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. This event greatly puzzled me, and I have continued to wonder what it could have been. I have a clear recollection of the incident and am fairly certain of the details I have provided. If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Not sure and Thin about a seen
Possibly of flying saucers near or around
Cincinnati. I'm sure it was something
not earthly from my standpoint-I mean
standing into my house and watching
it for several at the object. I did see
it move directly overhead. I watched
until it disappeared-it left just
The tail so was just below ant
The clouds-a strange looking object. 
It moved much faster than any jet or
airplane and seem to have no noise. 
The experiment was startling. If it was
the first time I ever seen anything like
Lighting for. Moore did not see it
With me at the time. This is the report
of the first time I ever seen anything
like that. I though at the time it was
an object help it is not at all what
I have read much about these strange
little craft.
