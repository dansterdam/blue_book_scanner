FOIA/CRINV-1968-07-7202467 Keystone

Kettering, Ohio
7 July 1968

On about 9 July 1966, I was on patrol in my squad car at about 5:30 PM. The weather was clear and visibility was good. I received a call on my radio to investigate a report of a strange object in the sky. I proceeded to the location, which was about 2 miles from my position. Upon arrival, I observed a silvery, disc-shaped object hovering about 200 feet above the ground. It appeared to be approximately 30 feet in diameter. The object made no sound and remained motionless for about 5 minutes. It then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view in a northerly direction. I immediately reported the sighting to my headquarters.

I am a police officer with 8 years of experience. I have never witnessed anything like this before. The object did not resemble any known aircraft. I am confident that what I observed was a genuine unidentified flying object.

Respectfully,
Patrolman John P. Smith
Kettering Police Department
