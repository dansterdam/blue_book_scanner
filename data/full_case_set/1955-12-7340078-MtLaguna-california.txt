The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Project 10073 Record Card from the Project Blue Book archives, dated 27 Dec 55, for an incident that occurred at Mt. Laguna, California. The record card provides details about the sighting, including the time, duration, type of observation, source, number of objects, and a brief summary indicating that the sighting was of a "Trace of unusual high speed observed on ground radar equip by 3 USAF operators. Speed estimated at 1,143 knots."

PART TWO MY 172282Z. PARA 1: JAMES D BUNCH S/LT. USAF, SENIOR CONTROLLER AT RADAR COULO BE CREDITED TO INTERNAL INTERFERENCE, HOWEVER, AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, THE RADAR PRESENTATION WAS NO INTERNAL INTERFERENCE ON OUR RADAR EQUIP. ALTHOUGH THE SPEED OF THE TRACK INDICATED WAS ESTIMATED AT 5,000 KNOTS, THE CALCULATED SPEED TAKEN FROM MEASUREMENTS OF THE TRACK SHOWED SPEEDS IN THE ORDER OF 1.500 KNOTS. WE BELIEVE THIS TRACK COULD POSSIBLE HAVE BEEN A TEST AGET FROM HUGHES ON EDGARS AFIS.HOWEVER, COULD NOT CONFIRM THIS TRACK WITH ANY OF THEIR ACTS. OBJECT APPEARED TO BE USING RADIO ALTIMETRY. THE JOCKEYS FINGERS SEEMED DAGGERS. ALTHOUGH THEY DID NOT RESEMBLE ANY PREVIOUSLY KNOWN INTERFERENCE INCURRED AT THIS RADAR INSTALLATION.

Downgraded to Unclassified 21 Sept 55 in accordance with declassification procedures. Duration 62 sec. Velocity 1,500 knots. Distance 50 miles. Time 1950.
