Memo for the Record: 16 Aug 67
There are no available records of air activity in the area. The person who took the report maintained that his child saw a light maneuvering or hovering in the sky. He suggested that the object was probably an aircraft. He suggested that we contact the Church because they are often engaged in night time operations.

Text output:

If there was MORE THAN ONE of them, and they were in a formation or appeared to be connected, and just observed for a time, then it was probably a single object, broken up in some way due to an optical illusion or disintegration, and the pieces were closely associated.

There are high tension wires along the parkland. I saw this object for about 2 minutes while approaching the area all the time trying to figure out what it was. Looked back after passing it and it seemed to be farther in the sky and then I lost sight of it in the fog. N.Y.

The clipping describes sightings of cigar-shaped unidentified objects flashing over several European countries. It mentions the U.S. Air Force also confirmed the sightings. The image does not contain any photographs, only the newspaper text.

World News 
Thousands See UFOs Flashing 
Over Europe
WIESBADEN, Germany - (AP) Cigar-shaped, unidentified objects flashing brilliant lights and zipping over Europe yesterday reportedly were seen by thousands. 
The U.S. Air Force said the sightings were confirmed by radar-equipped observers in England, France, Germany and Switzerland.
None of the objects were identified and no air force planes were in the areas when the sightings occurred, the press reported.
A Warsaw U.S. Air Force officer said the objects were sighted the past several nights, often after midnight, and had made sharp turns and accelerated rapidly. He said they looked like "fireballs" as they flashed lights that sometimes beamed to the ground.
One object was reported to have been tracked on radar for 15 minutes, flying at an estimated speed of 1,000 mph.
The sightings were similar to those reported earlier over parts of the United States, the Air Force spokesman said. Although there was no explanation, he added. "we don't believe they are imaginations or hoaxes."

MEMO FOR THE RECORD 19 July 67

Contact with SPADATS revealed that object number 2379 appeared somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean at approximately 0010Z. This was an unconfirmed visual report from NORAD's Saginaw, MI, over Europe and was responsible for many reports. SPADATS is contemplating its final decay message.
