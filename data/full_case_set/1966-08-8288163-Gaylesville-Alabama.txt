The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that describes a factual observation. The text discusses an object that was observed in the sky, including details about its movement and appearance. However, there is no photograph or image of the observed object included on this page.

Appendix 
Factual Observation:
(12) When the center "object" (light) was in its most forward position (see diagram), it was a brilliant white disc in intensity. The decrease in the intensity of the region where the leading object and the center object overlapped was only a fraction of a second but it was long enough that it was noticeable.

I didn't think that this was important until I was discussing the event with some professors at Georgia Tech. They seemed to think that it could be important. One professor in the Physics Dept. said that this could be important in being polarized and the increase in intensity being caused by interference, however, this would indicate that the "objects" were transparent - possibly gases.

Dear sirs:

It has been over a year now since I sent you the report of a UFO sighting, or rather a UAP, which I referred to it. I from time to time have wondered as to what your findings were. Surely you have had enough time.

The report which you might have misplaced (or my family) made the sighting: since then I have considered it possibly important to science findings. Please let me know carefully if you are conducting some further investigations. I have compiled file on the requirements for an engineering at U.S.D. in space engineering at Redstone Arsenal. In 1962, I was employed by Thiokol Chemical Corp. as propulsion engineer on the Pershing missile system. So you understand my interest.

Thank you for your time and waiting for your immediate reply.

Sincerely,

STATEMENT TO USAF DOBBINS AIR FORCE BASE
STATEMENT
Friday, 26 August 1966 my wife, three children and I were traveling from Huntsville, Alabama, to our home in Gaylesville, Alabama, our state line where highway 20 becomes highway 9. Four miles past the state line we intercepted highway 33. Approximately 6:15 PM CST as we turned onto 33, we noticed a cluster of objects, which my wife noticed were larger than a nickel held at arm's length and almost directly overhead. She said nothing to me at this time.
As we continued along 33, these objects closely followed us. They seemed to be maneuvering both in relation to each other and to our car as we drove along. When we reached the intersection where we turned off 33 onto the road leading to our home, the objects were still keeping up with us, remaining in position overhead. She said nothing to me at this time.
Upon arrival at our home, my wife commented that they were moving relative to several "near by stars." As we moved toward our right, away from the objects, they seemed to move more to our left, apparently in an effort to keep paced with us.
She pointed in the general direction. I paid little attention to this. Approximately 15 minutes later, the said "I can remember coming in just do not land in the middle of God's Country." She then looked over toward me and said, "What's the biggest air disaster that ever happened around here?" I did not know.
It was then that I looked up (about 6:15 o'clock) directly in a plane to the road. The objects had made a smooth maneuver, turning from East to West and pressing over us. I noticed that the car was slowing down. Three were at the vertices of an isosceles triangle moving with the objects vertexing in the direction of flight; the fourth object seemed to be moving more rapidly between the other three with rapid sporadic motion FORE and AFT along different directions.
The objects passed directly overhead normal to the highway and off into the distance. There was no noticeable wind on the ground, the temperature in Fort Payne, Ala. was 89® (approximately 16 miles away), the sky was clear - so clear that I could have easily driven my car by the bright moon light.

- page 10 -

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing a factual observation of unidentified objects. The text in the document is as follows:

(there was a 3/4 full moon), which was behind me and shining over my left shoulder. The objects were first sighted at 8:55 (+ 1/2 min) in CST (no daylight saving time).

when I went down the window, the objects were in clear view, and no discernible sound could be heard during the observation. the objects produced

FACTUAL OBSERVATIONS:

(1) The objects were sighted when directly behind the moon, when distance could not be determined. The diameter of objects was from 1/3 to 1/4 that of the moon.

(2) The objects' formation increased in size approximately seven to ten times.

(3) The time of final observation was 8:55 pm CST + 1/2 minute.

(4) The objects were circular.

(5) The triangular pattern was maintained by the objects for the duration of the observation.

(6) The light received by us was orange-yellow when they were at maximum size and bright white when first sighted.

(7) The objects made a smooth maneuver, turning from East to West.

(8) There was no noticeable wind on the ground and visibility was excellent for that time of night.

(9) The moon was bright and about 3/4 full.

(10) All objects were of equal intensity and were glowing when closest. (The center object was slightly a shade brighter than the outer three.)

(11) There was no detectable sound produced by the objects.

(12) When the objects reached their furthest position, there was a definite decrease in the intensity of the light. This corresponds to the center and three outer satellites being seen at their closest visual position. This was significant enough that it was noticeable; I didn't think that this was important during the observation, but the Physics Department said that this could be a result of the light being out of focus but still being held together by interference. 

*This statement was sent to the Air Force the next day as an appendix to official report. I believe it to be the most significant factual observation.

NON-FACTUAL IMPRESSIONS:
(1) The objects appeared to be higher than about 500 feet.
(2) If it was assumed that their speed was that of a conventional airplane, 400-500 mph, it would seem to indicate an extremely high angular velocity - my best guess would be 10 degrees per second.
(3) The time from first sighting to the time when they passed overhead was approximately 2 to 3 minutes.
(4) The time from passing overhead was approximately 1 to 2 minutes.
(5) The airport tower controller in Huntsville the next morning told me that there was only one small aircraft in the sky, and that it was south of there.
(6) I initially do not believe it was a conventional airplane.
(7) I leave open only the obscure possibility of balloons; however, I initially do not believe it was balloons because of the rapid motion of the center object and the cancellation of light when the two objects crossed.
(8) If they were balloons at an altitude of 500 feet, and if assuming their speed of balloons would be 25 mph, Recalling balloons and farther away they would seem unrealistically small for such clear weather conditions. If they were balloons and farther away, they would have been very large.
(9) I do not believe the objects were reflection, since I saw them clearly with my head outside of the window. Also, since there were no clouds, I do not believe it was a reflection of a light on a cloud.
(10) I am considerably (but not dogmatically) sure of what it was not. The objects were clearly seen by my wife, all of my three children, and myself. The above observations, as stated, are true and continue our conviction that an unusual object or objects of some kind were observed.

ESTABLISHMENT OF MODEL OF THE U.A.P. (U.F.O.) 

COMMENT 1: The "lights" (objects) were seen by my family and me as distinctly as you see the figures which are in their outline. The objects had absolutely no blur and their outline was sharp.

COMMENT 2: I arrived at this solution about two weeks after the sightings, but waited for the Air Force to contact me. The objects they never have done, then made these calculations, and was mightily astonished to discover that the electrical power lines were not noticed by me until May 1967, when I saw them on the extended map while examining the details of sighting when the objects were nearly overhead.

Transcription of the text in the document:

MAY 12, 1967

ESTABLISHMENT OF MODEL OF U.A.P. (UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENA OR U.F.O.)

The triangular pattern of the U.A.P. (U.F.O.) (lights) never changed during the sighting and one wide initial observation. This statement is based upon detailed discussion with her - they definitely maintained formation arrangement as reported. Even the road traveling west.

When first sighted, they had acute angles and were as small as "near star" with the center object (not rotating) apparently relative to the others. However, my wife mentioned that the formation was moving (recall that we were traveling/paralleling 50 mph) relative to the "near by" stationary stars.

Formation

very slowly southwest.
(a) moving slowly (relatively)
(b) center object not rotating
(c) constellation (relatively) stationary stars - but small.

Notice acute angles of triangle formed by outer three objects. Also lights appeared high in the sky (at least 20° to 25° clockwise from the north)(road direction is 10° counterclockwise from the north).

As the lights approached us (turning westward) they appeared as shown in figure 2 (on trajectory of overall colored formation).

The image contains a diagram and explanatory text related to a UFO sighting. The diagram depicts the movement and position of a "center light" or "object" that was observed, including the estimated point of equilibrium and the most forward and aft positions of the center light. The text provides details about the sighting, such as the frequency of the object's movements and the witness's perspective on the event. No human faces are visible in this image.

When "lights" passed over the car (station wagon), I first saw them. The figure being in 45 degrees to the north (center line of car), they were of a bluish color and varying in size from about the size of a dime to that of a silver dollar, occurring in rapid succession, with a frequency of about 2 cycles per second. (Notice that the object was single formed by the leading light.)

Figure 3.

As viewed when looking slightly directly straight up. 

Most forward position of center light.

Estimated point of equilibrium.

Most aft position of center light.

The dotted circles show limits of movement of center ("object") light. When in the more forward position, as shows in the figure above, the center light "overlapped" the leading light. When this occurred there was a "blink" as shown below.

My wife and I are both positive of this.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Assumptions:
(1) Objects (lights) were 500 feet above the level of the road. (My best guess)
(2) Each object was approximately 9.3 feet in diameter. (Based upon: measurement of finger's 3/4 inches from the eye and the estimate that the diameter of the object is the size of the length of the finger nail.) (= 0.5 inch)
(3) Assume three objects formed an equilateral triangle. (All angles = 60°)
(4) Guess from scaled drawing that, sides of triangle are 10 meters.
(5) Assume angle of attack (a) about 30° or so and get height of center light at maximum of about 8 meters.
(6) Assume the "lights" were electronia (electron clouds) and motion unaffected by atmosphere (assume vacuum).
(7) Assume positive charge for three outside lights and negative charge for moving center "object" (light).
(8) Assume dynamic probablity shown to be true only for the dynamic case.

May 18, 1967

Personal Comments:

1. After considering the facts as stated in the report as to the Air Force's have concluded that the unusual aerial phenomena that we observed were caused by natural atmospheric conditions combined with the electrical field near the ground and the magnetic field of the earth.

2. I believe that the "lights" were gases, electrically charged, which derived their energy from the natural electrical field and the magnetic field of the earth.

3. I think others, working in the field of U.F.O. or U.A.P. (unusual aerial phenomena) should be made aware of this observation - especially the "LINK" which occurred when the two subjects in the photograph came under the influence of the cause or causes that created the phenomenon.

4. NASA should not ignore the U.A.P. since it could possibly lead to new ideas for interplanetary probes for purposes of mapping the magnetic fields of other planets.

Dear [Redacted],

This will reply to your letter of November 5, 1967, whereby you reported sometime ago.

Your report on the sighting of your UFO sighting that you identified was that only this particular incident was called to our attention. You submitted particulars and it was established as the case, but it would appear as the only known objects observable in the area at the time.

Should you ever sight again significant UFO objects in the area, I will appreciate it if you will immediately report it through your force public information office, if any. We will conduct the UFO investigation and report the finding.

We hope the enclosed project blue book report will be of interest. Thank you for your interest in the Air Force UFO program.

1. Our office is in receipt of a report of an unidentified flying object sighting at approximately 2050 CST, 26 August 1966 in the Gadsden, Alabama area.

2. The observers reported a small cluster of star-like objects with a bright light at the rear. The objects were observed moving in a formation from east to west and passing over the observers. The observers saw four objects in the formation, each larger than the trailing one. The objects appeared to be maneuvering, changing altitudes, direction and speed. The fourth object maintained a constant object above the others in the direction of flight. The group was observed for approximately 10 minutes.

3. Request information on any aircraft activity or other identifiable objects which could have produced this sighting. Any assistance which can be provided to confirm or deny this report as to any objects or scope at time of observation. Any assistance which can be provided is appreciated.

Friday, 26 August 1966 my wife, three children and I were traveling from Ft Payne, Georgia to Gaylesville, Alabama. Our trip began on US Highway 11 and then became Highway 35. Four miles past the State line we intersected Highway 35 at approximately 9:55 pm. EDT. The sky was clear and the objects, which my wife noticed were then at our upper right (Gaylesville direction). She said her attention rested on them because they appeared a little larger than usual and seemed to be moving relative to each other. She said nothing to me at this time.

It was then that I looked up (about 11 o'clock) directly in front of the car. I was normal to the road. The objects had made a semi-circular passing movement and seemed to be at equilibrium in the center of the triangle and moved relative to each other through rapid progressions and rotations, once configuring themselves in the air direction.

The objects passed directly overhead normal to the highway and off into the distance.

There was no noticeable wind on the ground, the temperature in Fort Payne, Ala. was 65°F (approximately 16 miles away), the sky was clear. It looked to me that I could have easily driven my car through the triangle. The objects were far off in the vast at 8:55 (± 3 min).

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing text-based observations and descriptions.

FACTUAL OBSERVATIONS:
(1) The size of the objects when directly overhead had a relative diameter of approximately 1/3 to 1/2 that of the moon's diameter or about the size of a dime.
(2) The objects' formation increased in size approximately seven to ten times.
(3) The time of final observation was 8:55 pm CST + 1/2 min.
(4) The objects were circular.
(5) The reddish-orange pattern was maintained by the objects for the duration of the observation.
(6) The color of the light received by us was orange-yellow when they were at lower sizes and bright white when first sighted.
(7) The objects made a smooth maneuver, turning from East to West.
(8) There was no noticeable wind or sound and visibility was excellent from that time of night.
(9) The moon was about 3/4 full.
(10) All objects were of equal intensity and were glowing when closest.
(11) There was no detectable sound produced by the objects.

NON-FACTUAL IMPRESSIONS:
(1) The objects appeared to be higher than about 500 feet.
(2) If it were assumed that their speed was that of a conventional aircraft (about 300 mph), I would estimate their altitude to be approx. 3000 feet. I do not mean that they were at 3000 feet. I am only trying to establish the angular velocity of their position vectors.

The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a typed document discussing a UFO sighting. 

Here is the text from the document:

(3) The time from first sighting to the time when they passed overhead was about 2 to 3 min.
(4) The time from passing overhead was approximately 1 to 2 min. (These are only estimates)
(5) The airport tower controller told me that there was only one small aircraft near the sighting area, but that it was south of there.
(6) I personally, believe that it was not a conventional airplane.
(7) I do not believe they were space ships. The possibility of balloons; however, I intuitively do not believe it was balloons.
If they were balloons at an altitude of 500 feet, and if my assumption is correct that I could hear the balloons would be no more than 1 mile, this would hardly seem realistic. If they were balloons and drifted away, they would have been trailing light and they would have been very large.
I do not believe the objects were reflection, since I saw them clearly with my head outside of the window. Also, a light on a cloud would not seem to move that fast on a clear night.
(10) I am considerably (but not dogmatically) sure of what it was not.
The objects were clearly seen by my wife, all of my three children, and myself. The above observations are stated, as I recall, to the best of my knowledge of what actually occurred.

NOTE: Sighting reported to Fort Payne, Ala Police at 9:20 EST.
