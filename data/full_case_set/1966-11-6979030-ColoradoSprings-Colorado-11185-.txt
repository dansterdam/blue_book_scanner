1. ABSTRACT 
2. SUMMARY
3. DETAILS OF INVESTIGATION

General Information:
Date: 6 November 1966
Time: 1900 MST
Location: Colorado Springs, Colorado
Observers: Two adult observers

Narrative Summary:
At approximately 1900 hours, MST, on 6 November 1966, two adult observers observed a bright, unidentified light in the sky over Colorado Springs, Colorado. The light was observed for approximately 15-20 minutes before disappearing from view. The observers stated that the light seemed to be 'hovering' in the sky and changing colors from white to red to green. No other details were provided regarding the appearance or movement of the light.

Investigator's Analysis:
Based on the information provided, the investigator was unable to determine the nature or identity of the unidentified light observed by the two adult observers. No physical evidence or corroborating witness testimony was available to aid in the analysis. The investigator concluded that the light could not be satisfactorily explained and should be classified as an unidentified aerial phenomenon.

The image provided appears to be a black and white photograph. It shows a cloudy sky with some dark, shadowy shapes visible among the clouds. The shapes seem to be irregular and indistinct, giving the impression of an unidentified aerial phenomenon. However, there is no clear or distinct object visible in the image that could be definitively identified as a UFO.

The image shows a black and white photograph depicting a forested or grassy area at night. There appear to be two indistinct shapes in the foreground that could potentially be interpreted as human figures, but I cannot confirm this with certainty as I am unable to identify any individuals in the image.

OCR TEXT:
