The following is a translation of a report made by the Astronomical Society of Valparaiso on 28 August 1963:

"On 28 August 1963, around 23.00 hours local time, on the Eastern side of the Observatory of Pago Hondo (latitude 33.03'S, longitude 71.35'W), there was observed a luminous object which is close to the top of one of the mountains between the Cerro La Campana and the Cerro Alegre up to an altitude of approximately 20 to 30 degrees. This object was seen for about 30 minutes between 23.00 and 23.30 hours, when it suddenly shot upwards and disappeared in a fraction of a second."

The circles which this subject was making represented a slight inclination and fluttering motion. It appeared to be gliding. If these ovals were interpreted in its two dimensions with the naked eye, they would appear to be spheres. This movement was completely and again disappearing in the air, the nearest to the observer and the farthest away seeming to be the same size, a factor of approximately 2 meters in diameter with an increased brilliance. It appeared between West and South and its trajectory was accompanied by a long luminous trail.

Commentsin regard to this sighting:"Apparently this was a very brilliant light which is puised by radio signal system interlining the ground station plus a picture at the time could not be obtained. The radio receivers on this equipment are similar to the ones used for some intelligence purpose. The light phenomena was of a very high intensity and it has been observed by MASA specialized in the astronomical site of Cerro Tololo over a period of 15 days. Being submitted to preclude the listing of a sighting report by another agency.
