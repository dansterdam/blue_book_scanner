The text in the document is faded, and there are elements like regulatory form numbers at the bottom and classifications markers at the top and bottom of the document that indicate its official nature. Some fields in the form are filled out, suggesting it is part of a collection of data, possibly related to a UFO sighting given the date and the content of the fields.

1. The statement is made to create a basic misconception concerning the significance of the fact that a disk presumably seen near Holloman Air Force Base had its origin as part of a domestic secret development of the US Government is incorrect in every respect but one. It is understood that the term “disk” does not refer to any specific object which can be classified with identifiable properties.

2. During the late part of August 1947, the air surveillance system operated by this unit recorded as many as thirty-two unusual aerial phenomena in the area of Holloman Air Force Base. These phenomena varied in description from “circular disks of light” to “shapes that moved rapidly across the horizon and then suddenly stopped”. The occurrences were observed during daylight and evening hours and were variously described by experienced observers.

UNCLASSIFIED 11 May 1948

Report of trip to Holloman Air Force Base, 5 & 6 May 1948

1. The primary purpose of this trip was to interview _______, representative the Watson Laboratories, who was temporarily on loan to Holloman Air Force Base. Upon arrival, it was learned that _______ had returned to ____ _______ Laboratories, and Mr. Bank, J., not a teletype sent from Holloman Air Force Base stating that _______ would not be available for an interview did not reach Eg., AIC in sufficient time to postpone the visit. However, it was learned that _______ would be at Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, Ala. on or about 11 May 1948 for an indefinite period of time.

2. A civilian, Mrs. __________ who works in the same laboratory with ________, had also seen the unidentified flying object while in the presence of ________. Mrs. __________ interviewed with the following stated results:

a. The object definitely was not a balloon.

b. The object appeared round and white; was at a great altitude and moved at a high rate of speed.

3. Mr. ______ promised to send in a detailed report through channels, together with the report of another civilian who also witnessed the phenomenon.

4. It was also learned that ________ who works in the radar laboratory at Holloman A/F Base has, on several occasions in the past, witnessed on his scope unidentified objects at high altitude, moving at very high rates of speed. Major _______ was not available for interview, however, a request for a detailed report of these observations was forwarded to the Commanding Officer, Holloman A/F Base.

5. Lt. Colonel James C. __________ and Mr. Alfred O. _________ proceeded to _________, n.m., to interview Mr. ___________ and follow up on the report and photographic submitted by him two months ago. Although Mr. _________'s occupation employed as a poultry-plumber a night club, his primary interest is in a small but quite complete laboratory behind his house. According to the business cards, the laboratory in called "________ Research - Laboratory and ObservatorY", and Mr. _________ is referred to as the "Chief of Staff". Mr. __________ appeared to be completely sincere and apparently is quite interested in various atmospheric ________ phenomena and was an aircraft gunner and instructor during the last war, and that in his opnion, the object sighted definitely was not a wind-blown object. He reiterated that the object was not less than 2000 ft. away and that it was not much more than 2000 ft. away unless he had greatly underestimated its size. He _________ pointed out where he was stood when he took the picture of this flying object and indicated ________ exact marks of approach and departure. The object was first seen through a gap in the trees directly away from his observed that appeared to him to be as opening or vast cavern the entire trilling edge. Mr. __________ promised to send many other more detailed reports, incorporating this observation.

6. All agreed on the following; the object was very high, moved 
faster than any known aircraft, possessed a rounded, indistinct form, and
disappeared suddenly rather than fading away in the distance. It was under
observation 1/2 minutes or slightly less. It was definitely not a balloon
and evidently not manned judging from the violent maneuvers which were per-
formed at a high rate of speed.

7. A meteorologist stated that he placed great credence upon these obser-
vations because all these men are trained balloon observers. He suggested
that an observation team equipped with a special theodolite be on call and
that it be placed at Holloman Air Force Base in order that more definite informa-
tion might be secured in the event of a recurrence of an incident of this
type. He also suggested that the radio sonde stations in the U. S. be alerted
for incidents of this type, the personnel to alert the observers in this depart-
ment to be on the watch for and to report any similar incidents.

8. Mr. xxxx  of the Radar Laboratory was interviewed on 4 June
1948. His statements did not check very closely with those contained in Lt.
xxxx's report but this office xxx very xxxxx xxxxx that Lt. xxxx was
one of two observers on a xxxifid 50 MC Optical Tracking Device. The
observations this xxxxxx xxxxxxx see on this equipment could not be con-
firmed at any time by the other tracker. Mr. xxxx xxxxxxxx off the xxxxx

the view xxxx. He xxxxxxxxx that his xxxx of the xxxxxx and was possibly
due to a distant xxxxx. On 8 may he did not observe the xxxxxxxxxx and
also spoke of "cirrus" which is the effect on radar by the white xxxxx xxx to

reported from China Edwards.

                 ACTION OF OS XALXON

1. In the light of Mr. xxxx statements, the frequency of the
sightings at Holloman Air Force base does not warrant the placing of an ob-
servation team at that station. Should the sightings become more frequent
and more substantial evidence be received xxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx

       The xxxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxx pepper XXXXX Xxxxx will be questioned
