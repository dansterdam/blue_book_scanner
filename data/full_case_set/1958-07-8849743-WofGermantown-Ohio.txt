The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet (SUMMARY DATA) where an observer has provided a written account of a sighting of a bright light that was moving and eventually disappeared.

The text in the document states:
"I was well aware that may be a natural formation or astronomical phenomena. The light first appeared was reddish colour and seemed to linger around for some time, dimmed and then suddenly appeared a bright light which I though was a low flying aircraft. It moved around briskly and suddenly appeared still and gave the impression of being quite large. Light was unusually bright, had no blinking and steady. Light was still visible after some time and suddenly disappeared but may have gone behind some obstruction."
