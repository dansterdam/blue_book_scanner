2. SOURCE: Military 
3. LOCATION: Glasgow AFB, Montana
10. CONCLUSION: Sighting: Others'(confusing report) Insufficient data for evaluation
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
SEE CASE FILE
The observers state the object was bright, white, round, and much larger than a star at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet and no sound was heard. The data is confusing, does not have sufficient detail to be conclusive, and is not contributing as positive factual information to aid in the evaluation of the sighting as of 27 Feb 67.

Reference is your subject as above, dated 22 August 1967. The following is submitted:

1. The first object was observed for a few minutes. The second object was observed for about one hour by Sergeants Vaughn, Hansen, and others.

2. The first object was viewed on radar. The second object showed up on radar but in a different position. The objects showed intermittent activity.

3. FTD Form 165 is designed to cover sightings of only one object. Therefore the information was conflicting.

4. Tower personnel were contacted. Air activity in the area at the time the objects were sighted. Tower personnel did not observe the objects.

5. Sergeant Hansen was the only one that heard the sound of the engines. 

Added information: The sightings were of flashing lights.

1. Reference is made to the subject UFO report(attached).
2. Although the sighting was reported to have been observed on radar, the references to red, white, and blue light beams are not consistent with the radar sighting. Obviously, the references to red, white, and blue light beams and an oscillation of the object with which the radar sighting is associated indicates that the visual sighting is inconsistent with the radar sighting.

Dear Mr. Low,

Reference my telephone conversation with Miss McKelvey concerning a radar-visual observation from Glasgow AFB, Montana. I enclose a photofluorographic information on the 25 February 1967 sighting.

We had requested more information on the radar portion of the sighting but the data indicates only that a radar contact was made. The duration, however, seems to indicate the target was tracked for only one-two minutes while the radar sighting was in excess of that time.

Sincerely,

The image contains a sketch or diagram related to a report on an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch shows a compass rose, as well as instructions for the observer to mark the location of the object and its direction of travel. There is also a question asking how many objects were observed, with the observer providing a handwritten response.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object. 

28. Draw a sketch that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, THEN HOW MANY WERE THERE? 2
Draw a picture of how they were arranged and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.

We reference your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation in the above subject. Unfortunately, we do not have any photographic data to confirm your observation, however, correspondence with you and any persons present is still appreciated.

2. Questions of your sighting are confirming: at times we find it difficult to distinguish what you observed you may have seen. Could you provide a more detailed description of the object, its size, shape, color, speed, direction of movement, and duration of the sighting (two hours) to the best of your recollection? Any additional data would be most helpful in assessing the nature of the occurrence.

3. You also indicated that you saw "the object" on a radar display. Since additional indication was that it was then "visually sighted", please clarify how long it was painted, what altitude, speed and direction of travel it displayed, and any other pertinent radar data available.

4. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

TEXT OUTPUT:

TEST/UFO (Maj Quintanilla/70216/ths/22 Aug 67)
UFO Observation, 24 February 1967

314th Combat Support Group
Reference your unclassified message, BC OO-25, 5 March 1967, subject "Report of UFO Sighting: The initial report from your office with the forms completed by the observers, several consulting and investigating individuals, became available. Before considering any action, the following additional information is requested:

1. The watch of the two objects was observed for several minutes and subsequent observation was also visually for several minutes.

2. Did the radar operator actually observe any of the objects, both, or visually only? If there were two objects, did both appear on radar? 

3. At the object for two minutes, yet a completed FAI Form 14 indicates their observation only for less than two minutes.

4. There was no indication whether tower personnel were contacted; and it missing observe the objects. If none, why?

Your report also indicates that Sergeants Vaughn and Hanson heard a sound similar to a jet engine. However, the completed form indicates that the observer, Sgt Vaughan, did not hear any sound. Request this discrepancy be clarified.
