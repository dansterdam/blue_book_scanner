FRICK PARK AREA, PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA
15 September 1959

On 15 September 1959 the Pittsburgh police investigated a reported explosion in the Frick Park area of the city. The explosion was reported to have occurred on 9 July 1959. The investigating officer reported that the object was conically shaped, and the body was of polyethylene plastic, yellow in color. There was a circuit consisting of a light bulb, battery, and an antenna attached to it with 1/2" bolts. The weight of the object was twelve pounds.

During inspection of the object attempts were made to open it, but nothing was destroyed except a mercury switch which controlled the internal circuitry. The object appeared to be entirely free of moving parts and the wiring contained in the aluminum were the following items, all imbedded in a glue-like substance which was used to fill the interior:

a. Nickel metallic lantern battery container with switch.
b. Signal flare (chromium leads ends); 5 1/2" long and 1 3/4" diameter.
c. Light ray-o-vac flashlight batteries (four in the battery container).
d. Two mercury switches.
e. Tiny atom 1/200th horsepower electric motor (Wilson's of Cleveland).
f. Transformer (Cleveland Transformer Division, Boonton, N.J.).

The batteries, mercury switches, electric motor, and light bulb were all wired; however, the electric motor was not connected electrically to anything. The antenna and transformer were not a part of the circuit. 

Vision's or Cleveland, manufacturer of the tiny atom electric motor, when contacted concerning the motor indicated that their chief outlets were hobby shops. In view of the relatively great weight, fragsushtedly, overall lack of any productive function, and crudeness this object is ruled out as a device designed to collect information.

All evidence indicates that this object was not airborne at any time. An object containing a heavy cylindrical base would, upon falling, cause the sharp points of the base to dig into the ground, thereby indicating that this incident was the fact that the light bulb and 1/2" plastic cover were found intact.

It is the Air Force conclusion that this object and the explosion were all part of an incident, flashed by mercury switches, and the whining of the transformer was the result of the contacts of the several circuits being closed. Since this incident happened at the beginning of the school term, this was probably a prank or school experiment.

1. On 15 September 1959, the Pittsburgh police investigated a reported explosion in the Frick Park area. The explosion was reported to have occurred about 10:30 PM. During the investigation, the police discovered an unidentified object in the area of the reported explosion. This object was found to consist of a shape similar to that of plastic, and had a metal cable attached to it with a 1 inch bolt. The object was subsequently turned over to the Department of the Air Force.

2. The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center was notified of this report by the Air Defense Command Post received the message from AFOIN Indications Center.

3. In compliance with a telephone request from ATIC, Captain Trembley, as Chairman of the ATIC Evaluation Group, conducted a preliminary investigation and forwarded the object with his report to ATIC. Captain Trembley pointed out that he was unable to determine what the object was.

4. The object measured nine inches in diameter at the base and eleven inches in height. The body was of polyethylene plastic, yellow in color, three-sixteenth inch in thickness. It contained a thin stem or shaft protruding from the base which was attached to a steel cable with a 1 inch bolt. The weight of the object was alleged to be about the same as the object was burned.

5. Attempts were made to open the object without destroying it, but it was found to be impenetrable. Under the outer skin of plastic, the object was found to contain an inner skin or shell which was concentric in the aluminum was the following items: a light bulb, a switch, and some other items that could not be identified and appeared to be of a technical nature.

The image contains a description of a device, but does not include any photographs. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

a.  dilos Huntlite lantern battery container with switch.
b. Steel pipe (threaded both ends) 2Â¼ inches long, 1 3/8 inches 
diameter. 
c. Eight Ray-O-Vac flashlight batteries (four in the battery container) . Batteries outside of the container were covered with electrical tape.
d. Two mercury switches.
e. Tiny atom, 250 horsepower electric motor (Wilson's of Cleveland).
f. Transformer (General Telephone and Radio Corporation, Houston, Texas).
g. Flashlight bulb and socket with red plastic cover.
h. Flexible antenna (approximately 54 inches long).
i. The batteries, mercury switches, electric motor, and bulb were all wired together. The antenna and transformer were not a part of the circuit. This circuitry appeared to be a haphazard construction that did not seem to have any specific purpose. The only thing that held it together was the construction of the device.
7. Wilson's of Cleveland, manufacturers of the tiny atom electric motor, was contacted by telephone. They stated that they do not have a contract to supply the U. S. Government with these motors or connectorsTor them. The president of the company informed that one of their small motors had been involved in some "shady" dealing or transactions. 
8. In view of the relatively great weight, absence of any transmitter or receiving equiptment, and the incapability and overall lack of an obvious productive function, this object is ruled out as a Rawinnsonde or any device used by the government for upper air research. 
9. All evidence indicates that this object was not airborne or flying saucer. An observation was made that should an atomic vehicle be able to operate without the usual associated equipment, this object would not qualify, as it has been noted that the tow weight and lack of "gadgets" are the chief requirements for such a vehicle. 
10. It is also certain that this object and the explanation were all in a downward trend. At the time of the report, the authorities were making every effort to help to attract attention, however the intensity of the interest was rapidly diminishing as it was the beginning of the school year. This was probably the prank of college students.

1. Enclosed as attachment 1, a true copy of a report, dated 15 September 1959, which was forwarded to this headquarters by the Greater Pittsburgh Airport. The object was sighted by the airport tower operator and a copy of the Police report along with sketches of the object received are attached.

2. The undersigned, upon receiving a call from Sgt. Bollou, Greater Pittsburgh Airport Control Tower, was informed that the object was possibly a part of a weather balloon radio transmission and that as soon as visibility allowed, the ground crew would attempt to locate and recover the object. A complete description was given, the weather man furnished additional information to me, and as no further contact was made operations, the object and identified it as a weather balloon and informed the Intelligence Center accordingly.

3. Investigation by the Pittsburgh Police and Bales Station, no evidence of an explosion or reason for an explosion was found. To the best of my knowledge no other agencies were notified of the incident and no further action had nothing to do with it.
