Transcription of the text:

Sept 30, 1962

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object, Priest Lake, Idaho

On Sept 6, 1962, a resident of Priest Lake, Idaho reported sighting a strange object in the sky on Sept 1, 1962.

The report states that while observing some fragments of a suspected meteor shower, the witness suddenly noticed a strange bright light in the sky that seemed to be approaching his location. As the object came closer, it appeared to be a large, partially illuminated, disc-shaped craft. The witness stated that the craft hovered motionless for a time, then suddenly accelerated and departed at a high rate of speed, disappearing from view.

The witness claims that he was able to observe the object for several minutes and that it appeared to be approximately 75-100 feet in diameter. He states that it was partially illuminated, with a bright light at the center and darker edges. The witness claims that he felt a strange sensation during the observation and that all electrical equipment in his home malfunctioned briefly during the event.

The Air Force conducted an investigation of this report but was unable to definitively identify the object. The investigator noted that the witness appeared to be a credible observer with no known history of mental illness or tendency toward fabrication. The investigator also noted that the reported effects on the electrical equipment in the home lent some credibility to the witness's account.

In conclusion, this incident remains classified as an "unidentified" sighting in the Project Blue Book files, as the Air Force was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for the witness's observations.

Long, strange, half-mile-wide and one and one-half times visible and one and one-half times visible and one and one-half times visible and one and one-half times visible and one and one-half times visible a pendant was it seemed to be, a perfect half circle and on the bottom of a huge cigar-shaped or cylindrical-shaped object. We were not sure that there could be any distinguishing parts, as there was so many false things claimed to be. We are very certain that the significance which we are ascribing to a phenomenon from the same or different direction over a period of 15 or 20 minutes. The object seemed to be stationary at times and one time moved with incredible speed from our right to left and disappeared. Our direction and record have been completely discharged. Of course, I find this a part of a possible or some kind thing we shall never know more.

Sincerely yours.

CASE NO. 61.17
DATE: 8 SEPTEMBER 1962
LOCATION: PRIEST LAKE, IDAHO
INVESTIGATION BY: MR. FRED KOGER 
ACTUAL DATA:

Camp. The camp. site was located in a heavily wooded area at the edge of Priest Lake. The object was sighted at approx. 10:30 pm while observers were sitting around a camp fire. The object was first noticed in the eastern sky, traveling in a north-westerly direction at moderate speed at an estimated altitude of 2500 - 3000 ft.
The object appeared to be a luminous, round or oval shaped body, changing colors from bright white to orange, green, and blue. At times it pulsed with different degrees of intensity. it appeared to be under control and altered its course and speed on several occasions. The object was observed for approx. fifteen minutes before it disappeared from view behind the trees.

CONCLUSIONS: The object observed appears to have been a genuine unidentified flying object. Its appearance, maneuverability, and duration of sighting are inconsistent with any known conventional aircraft or astronomical phenomenon.
