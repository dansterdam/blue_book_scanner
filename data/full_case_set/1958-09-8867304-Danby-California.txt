STATEMENT

Last fall about the last of September three of us were standing
at the mill at railroad Danby. we saw a strong glow of light coming from the foothills of the clipper Mtns. We thought this to be a bank of mines. This intense glow lasted about 20 minutes. It was approximately 4 miles from where we were standing. Time 9 P.m. The next morning "X", and myself discussed what it could be, but started it was no mine bank and it was something that did not belong there. The next day it happened again at the same time and lasted about 20 minutes. Until the sun had moved and the glow went out, however this time there was just two of us "X" and myself. We watched it through a telescope. Under the glass the glow was more vivid. two cylindrical shaped, round nosed, glowing objects were packed in a large deep gully. They were about 40' apart sitting approximately north and south. They were about two or even keel and we could see no signs of life. They were very bright whitish color light and as bottles. We thought at first it was a crashed airliner. The next morning we went out and searched the areas, and found nothing. At 4 p.m we again waited at RR Danby to see the glow but it did not occur. again. They had left during the night. I am quite sure I can almost pinpoint the place if I return to the area.

STATEMENT

        Around the end of September two other men and I were standing at Richelieu's Mill talking about prospecting when we noticed a glow in the direction of Clipper Kent. We watched the glow for a while and then it disappeared. Later that night we talked about it and decided to watch for it the next day. The next day it appeared again at the same time. We knew there was nothing metallic in that area and thought it might be an airplane because of its metallic glow. Mr. __ took his telescope and looked at it, and spotted it on the hillside. We drove as far as possible and walked for three or four hours in the general area. The exact spot was on a line from RR Danby northwest over Route 66 Danby. We aligned ourselves with two fixed places and searched but could not find evidence of the objects. I remembered a few days later that the objects were visible almost every day in the same area so a friend and I investigated further. We used a powerful pair of binoculars and watched the glow. We noticed guy wires coming from it and looked closer and saw rods radiating from the guy wires. We remembered that mill radio antennas of the California Highway Patrol were at Route 66 Danby and determined that the sun cast a reflection on the antennas and that that was what we were looking at all the time and that was why we could find no evidence in the foothills. We did not report this information and thought the whole thing had been solved.

DANBY, CALIFORNIA
2 October 1958

On 6 March 1959, this Center received a letter from a resident of Los Angeles, California reporting the sighting of an unusual object. The limited information contained in the letter was insufficient to allow analysis. A request for investigation was made to a unit directly associated with the organization which falls under the jurisdiction of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence. The following is a summary of the information derived, and the final conclusions reached concerning this incident.

On 2 October 1958, three men were standing at Richeleau’s Tungsten Mill at Railroad Danby discussing prospecting. The time was approximately 1600 hours PST, when what appeared to be a bright glow, or flash of light, in the northwest attracted their attention. One man said it must be the sun reflecting off a bank of mica. The other two didn’t think there was that much mica in that area because they had prospected the area in the past. The glow was in view for approximately two and one half hours and then disappeared when the sun lowered in the sky.

The next day at the same time the glow or light reappeared in the same location. Two of the observers looked at it with a small telescope and the glow appeared to be oblong as in an aircraft fuselage, and the color of aluminum. The size of the object appeared to be approximately 15 feet long, 5 feet high, and solid. The distance to the object was estimated to be about five miles. The three men then drove as far as they could toward the object and walked around the area for three or four hours, but could find no evidence of such an object.

A few days later one man remembered that the object, or glow, was visible almost every day in the same area. Two of the men decided to investigate further. They took a pair of powerful binoculars, studied the object, and noticed guy wires coming from it. Upon looking closer, rods were seen radiating from the guy wires. They then remembered that two tall radio antennas used by the Highway Patrol were located at Highway 66, Railroad Danby and decided the sun was reflecting off these antennas.

Air Force investigation confirmed the views of the witnesses. The antennae were found to protrude above the tree tops approximately 20 feet, and were spaced approximately 20 feet. It was determined that the reflection from these attenneas could be seen from Railroad Danby only during a relatively short period of the year for the hour of this report. This explains why the sighting appeared unusual to the witnesses who are residents of the area.

It is concluded that the cause of this sighting was the sun reflecting off radio antennaes.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER

In view of observations made by SOURCES at Danby and by the two
investigators, an evaluation of probable optical illusion caused by sun reflec-
tions on radio antennae is given this report. It is felt that Los Angeles
SOURCE would have agreed had he been given the time for further investigation

COMMENTS ON FIELDSONS OBJECTS

In view of observations made by sources and study made by the two investigators, the explanation of probable physical illusions caused by the satellites seemed reasonable to both groups; it is felt that all practical sources would have been given this case for further investigations as did the other observers.

The bright sun reflected at a particular time from an object invisible to the observer often produces a puzzling phenomenon, such as the flying saucer reported from Danby, California, early in October 1958.

About 4:00 in the afternoon on October 2, three prospectors standing near a tungsten mill at Railroad Danby noticed a sudden bright glow in the northwest sky which remained visible for about 2% hours and then disappeared. When a glow appeared again the following day at the same time and place, the observers tried to identify it by using a small telescope and saw a bright, oblong object hovering above the horizon; it was the color of aluminum, approximately fifteen feet long, five feet high, and about four miles away. Getting into a car, the men drove in the direction of the object and searched the supposed location on foot for several hours, but could find no trace of the UFO.

Several days later, realizing that the object reappeared every day at about the same time and place, two of the men decided to investigate further. Studying the object through a pair of powerful binoculars, they could see guy wires coming from it and rods radiating from the guy wires. Remembering that two tall radio antennas used by the highway patrol stood in approximately the same location, the witnesses found the explanation, which Air Force investigators confirmed. The antennas, placed some twenty feet apart, extended about twenty feet above the trees. The cigar-shaped hovering object was a special effect depending on a particular combination of circumstances: only during the first part of October, and only late in the afternoon, did the sun’s rays strike the antenna in such a way that the reflection was visible to an-observer at Railroad Danby [1]:

                Report of Inquiry

    On the (blank) day (blank), at about (blank) hours, I made 
observation. While standing outdoors, I noticed an object at 
certain height.
    Suddenly, this object made a maneuver in the western skies, 
an (blank) bore in mind (blank).
    The object appeared to be shiny and cylindrical in shape. As 
it moved, it left a visible trail behind it. The trail was 
noticed for an estimated (blank) minutes before fading. 
    I estimate the speed of the object to be in excess of 
(blank) miles per hour at which point it disappeared from sight 
about (blank) degrees to the west of my location.
    After this, there was an unusual silence that ensued the 
disappearance of the object. No further sightings were made 
by myself or any other observer present in the vicinity at that 
time.
    This account was relayed to Project Blue Book for further 
analysis and documentation. Signed,

Text Output (OCR):

Of all the 590 UFO reports the Air Force received in 1958
probably the most dated report came from Danby California. About 10:00 A. M. on October 5, 1958, two men driving a grader spotted a bright light in the sky coming from the east. At first it looked like a used discarded parachute liner blowing in the wind but after thinking about the speed it was travelling they decided it couldn't be. As the object came closer they could see it was round and appeared transparent with darker heavy objects inside giving off the reflection in the direct sunlight. They saw what appeared to be the top of a bright white light dome
