SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

SIGHTING OF SUPPOSED "FLYING SAUCERS"
JACKSON, MISS.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:
Mrs. R, a housewife - reportedly sighting two "flying saucers" Friday afternoon, February 26, 1960 at approximately 1500 to 1630 hours, heading in a westerly direction, maintaining equidistance between them, at an estimated 1000 to 1500 feet altitude. According to her account, this sighting was to the best of her judgment, the objects were approximately three to four feet in diameter, round, metallic in appearance, and giving off a vapor trail similar to that given off by jet aircraft. She stated she observed them for approximately four minutes, and further stated that she was unable to determine the exact speed of the objects but that they were very fast. Mrs. R stated that in this vicinity, Mrs. Jackson, Miss., told her they (the objects) were similar to those she had observed some while working on a cotton plantation in the area. Examination of Mrs. R by this office revealed that her recollection of the incident was detailed and her sincerity appeared unquestionable.

A check with Mr. George Fisk, meteorologist, U.S. Weather Bureau, Jackson, Miss., revealed that the two objects seen by Mrs. R could not have been weather balloons indicated travel by same in the opposite direction of the objects sighted.

Jackson Woman Vows She Sees 'Fantastic' Saucers
The report describes how two "flying saucers" were observed by Mrs. Ed Morgan, a prominent woman in Jackson, Mississippi, who claimed to see strange aerial objects during the daytime. The objects were described as moving in a straight line and keeping the same distance, with a vapor trail behind them. The report also mentions that the objects gave off a steady light, but the sound was not like that of a jet aircraft.
