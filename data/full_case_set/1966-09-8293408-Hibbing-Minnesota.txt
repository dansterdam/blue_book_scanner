WED (ETTER) J, 
t a 34533

Greenfield, Minnesota 55719

Dear Mr. 

After investigating your most unusual observation in the sky on May 12, 1966, I find that it might be interpreted as a nice-Apache rocket launched from Fort Churchill, Canada. 

Having considered the available information and having received a report from the Directorate of Space Systems, USAF, and from the National Research Council of Canada, contact was made with a Mr. McRae of Goddard Space Flight Center. The following information:

"On October 19, 1966, there was a Nike-Apache rocket launched from Fort Churchill, Canada. The rocket reached an altitude of 105 miles and was in the upper atmosphere for approximately 6 to 7 minutes over a wide area. The objectives of the test were cloud releases to obtain motion pictures and spectroscopic data, and to obtain data on the upper atmosphere."

Although there were several different cloud releases during the day, your observation of the launch at 0132Z was the single launch corresponding to your observation. These cloud releases are a truly fascinating phenomenon to observe, and I am sure you will attest.

Sincerely,

EDGAR QUINTANILLA, JR. MAJOR, USAF 
Chief, Project Blue Book

At 0132 14 Sept. 66 there was a rocket launch from Fort Churchill, Canada: rocket was a Nike-Apache (11-278 ACA-D) and altitude of 102 status miles. This was not a specific ballistic missile launchial it was a chemical and it would have produced color to those launched in August also.

Additional launchings -
