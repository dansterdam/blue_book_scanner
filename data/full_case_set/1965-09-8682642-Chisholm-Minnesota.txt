The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a sketch or diagram that seems to depict the movement and direction of a UFO or unidentified object. The sketch includes various angles and measurements, as well as a compass rose. There is no photograph present in this particular image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine they you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve that shows how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" where I saw the object leave the horizon (skyline).
28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The shape of the object seemed to be circular with a dome on the top surface. The color, from a distance, appeared to be metallic gray. It moved across the sky at a high rate of speed making no sound whatsoever. It appeared to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. At one point during the sighting, the object seemed to hover and then accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed, disappearing from sight within a few seconds.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a report about a UFO sighting that occurred in Chisholm, Minnesota on September 29, 1965.

The text in the document is as follows:

CHISHOLM, MINNESOTA 
29 SEPTEMBER 1965

These 5-9755, observer, noted five strange colored objects in the west at an elevation of about 30Â°. All of a sudden three of the objects made a turn toward the southwest and the other two seemed to just disappear. Within a minute or two one of the objects reappeared and made a turn toward the southeast and then also disappeared. He also stated that the objects were moving much faster than a jet, which he had watched before. Particular attention was given, by the witness, to the objects and 22 green lights which he had never seen on an aircraft. He stated these were none.

COMMENTS
The observation has characteristics of being either aircraft or other flying objects, however, certain factors conflict with such a conclusion. A weather balloon from Duluth would have been in the area at the time of the observation, however, distortion scintillation with this condition since the witness denies any resemblance to such an object. Also, there was no reported aircraft in the area and the objects traveled much faster than an aircraft and made extremely sharp turns. As such, the case must remain in the unidentified category.

The text on the page reads:

"A call was made on January 14, 1965, to Miss REDACTED of Chisholm, Minnesota. Reference to sighting of 22 September gave a report regarding in unsatisfactory condition owing to absence of quantitative data. Almost entirely possible that it was three aircraft. As long as the witness insists that the lights traced faster than aircraft and made no sound, the case must remain in the unidentified category."
