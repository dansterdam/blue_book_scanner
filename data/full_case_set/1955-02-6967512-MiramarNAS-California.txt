3 FEBRUARY 1955

FROM: OFFICE OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE (ATTN: LT 200 SFC. OF OPERATIONS), SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA

SUBJECT: OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT

1. AT 1150 HOURS, THE MORNING OF 2 FEBRUARY 1955, THIS OFFICER DEPARTED THE MIRAMAR NAS IN A PRIVATE VEHICLE IN ROUTE TO THE U.S. NAVAL HOSPITAL, BALBOA PARK, SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA.

2. WHILE CROSSING THE MAIN RUNWAY OF THE AIR STATION, THIS OFFICER OBSERVED A SMALL SILVER-COLORED AIRCRAFT AT A DISTANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET ON THE RUNWAY. APPARENTLY THE AIRCRAFT WAS TAKING OFF SINCE IT WAS AIRBORNE BY THE TIME THIS OFFICER ARRIVED AT THE SPOT WHERE IT HAD BEEN OBSERVED.

3. DURING AN EMERGENCY, THIS OFFICER CAREFULLY OBSERVED BOTH LANDING GEAR AND THE NOSE WHEEL AS THEY WERE DOWN. SIMULTANEOUSLY, I NOTED THE OTHER DISTINCTIVE MARKINGS, BUT COULD NOT ASCERTAIN EXACTLY WHAT THE DEPARTING OBJECT WAS. IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT IT WAS SOME SORT OF AIRCRAFT, BUT JUST PASSED.

4. BEING UNABLE TO ASCERTAIN EXACTLY WHAT THE DEPARTING OBJECT WAS AND NOT BEING ABLE TO OBTAIN FURTHER INFORMATION BECAUSE OF THE BREVITY OF THE OBSERVANCE, I IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDED TO THE U.S. NAVAL HOSPITAL, BALBOA PARK.

5. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE HOSPITAL AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES, I SUBMITTED A REPORT OF THE INCIDENT TO THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES. 

IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE EVEN APPROXIMATELY THE OBJECT'S SPEED OR ALTITUDE. FURTHER, IT WAS NOT DISCERNIBLE BY SIGHT OR SOUND TO WHAT TYPE OF AIRCRAFT IT BELONGED. ALTHOUGH THIS AIRCRAFT APPEARED TO BE OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE, IT WAS DUBBED BY EYES, LOOKED AWAY FOR AN INSTANT AND AGAIN CONCENTRATED ON THE ESSENTIAL. THOUGH HAVING ALTITUDE, DESCRIPTION, COLOR, ETC., IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE EVEN APPROXIMATELY SPEED OR ALTITUDE. IT WAS OBSERVED APPEARED TO BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 5 TO 10 SECONDS. I WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE AN AIRCRAFT, BUT WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE ITS SPECIFIC TYPE. A BRIGHT REFLECTION FROM THE SUN, I WAS FURTHER ABLE TO DETERMINE THE OBJECT'S GENERAL OUTLINE WAS NOT SIMILAR TO ANY KNOWN CONVENTIONAL TYPE AIRCRAFT. UPON LEAVING THE SCENE, I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES.

runs reasonably true north and south at that point. It is with extreme caution that this officer is writing this description. I would hazard a guess the object was not less than 25 to 35 feet in diameter. That is disregarding the relative size. The distance involved and the fact that this officer was unable to force himself to approach closer to his suspicion of the nature of the object is very probabaly the reason the object was beyond determining what it really was, or if there were any opening or construction. This officer has been serving in Naval Aviation for approximately 25 years and is familiar with the normal illusions one can see in connection with high speed, high altitude aircraft. This officer did not at any time paint or sketch any phenomena and I believe this statement to be a honest one on the part of this officer, the object, a definite mass and was not a reflection or an optical illusion.
