10. CONCLUSION
The person who reported the sighting believed that a flying object was observed in the air, but it was simply an illusion that was not reflecting the actual size or shape of the object observed.

11. DATA SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object was observed at 2020 in the NW. Looked like a planet, was red, green, blue and white, and moved into two parts. The part moved into the center, and the other part disappeared. At this point it disappeared. No other observations were made.

The image on this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book does not contain a photograph. Instead, it contains a sketch or diagram showing a curved line with various angle markings and a compass rose.

Here is the text that has been produced by the OCR system:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object or objects were above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object or objects were above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

If you have any more questions you would nat answer don't hesitate to write me.

Acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 3 Day 5 Month 1965 Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

1) Military types of things which have been photographed before. This is not something new, but an occurrence of these phenomena.
2) Daytime observation - I know it was not planes, as the object hovered, moved swiftly, and maneuvered in a manner not consistent with the behavior of aircraft.
3) angle - I know it was not meteors, as the elevation angle remained fairly constant for long periods of time.
4) the change direction so rapidly and unexpectedly without sound was most astounding. 
5) Numerous objects and similar activity observed on prior occasions.

If my statement 1 above is deemed significant (as I sense the same original skepticism), I would be pleased to have a meeting with your representatives to clarify my observations, which in no way can be considered an "imaginary" or "fantastic" sighting. My observations were precise and factual, and my report is made in good faith. I realize there are many facets of the UFO subject which may not be acceptable or credible to your organization, but I am confident that your thorough investigation of this case will reveal the factual nature of these observations.
