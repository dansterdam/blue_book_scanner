There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed document that appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report from the United States Air Force.

Here is the text from the document, produced by an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system:

On the 6th of August, 1952, at 07:12 an unidentified target was observed on our radar scopes in the vicinity of Carp Bay, Ontario. This blip had the appearance and size of a multi-engine aircraft, but manner of flight characteristics was not characteristic of normal flight handling by this station.

The above-mentioned caused us to plot this target and notify ACAO of same. Radar maintenance men on duty at the time did not believe that the blip was caused by interference from a nearby station.

This target when first observed was on a 300° heading into our station, and varied within a range of 70 miles. It then approached at a range of 30 miles on an outbound course of 050°. Speed was estimated in excess of 800 knots. At the time of last detection, the target was at a range of 200 miles.

The shared image appears to contain no photograph, only text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

On the 8th of August 1952, an unknown target appeared on radar for about 7 minutes. It was tracked on visual observation also, and it traveled at a speed of 700 to 800 miles per hour. Two subsequent plots established a track on a heading of 200 degrees, with a speed estimated at 900 to 1200 knots. This track did not have the appearance of a track normally plotted by this station. USAF was notified and the information was passed on to ATIC.

The target found it a course of 25 to 30 miles, and maneuvered on a heading of 20 degrees. The operators plotted the track to confirm range, on the same heading, and at the same speed mentioned above.

The entire maintenance crew on duty at the time witnessed the incident, and did not believe the target to be interference from any other station.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing a radar sighting event that occurred on August 6 at approximately 0230 hours. The document discusses the targets detected by the radar, their speed and altitude, and the nature of the radar returns. The document concludes that the radar returns were likely caused by some phenomenon other than interference.

On the morning of August 6, at approximately 0230 hours, the radar scope observed what seemed to be targets traveling at very high speed, estimated to be well above eight hundred knots an hour.

These targets were painting on a slight angle, not perpendicular to the scope when it appeared. According to the report, this suggested that the targets were tracked by interference from another radar site. If it was interference, it was not like any that I have ever seen on this radar site.

The returns looked very much like ordinary targets except for the slight angle when they appeared. It was reported that if these targets occurred between this station and another, they could be definitely classified as interference.

However, since the returns were seen traveling in two different directions at times, it is very likely that there are two more radar sets within our range transmitting on the same frequency. I would say that these returns were caused by some other phenomenon other than interference.

REPORT OF Unidentified Flying Objects
SUBJECT OF
DATE OF OBSERVATION Aug 8, 1952
LOCATION Port Austin, Michigan
SOURCE
Lt. Balsh, L.C., Air Attache
SUMMARY: On 8 August 1952 a Finland pilot, Captain - - - U.S.A.F. made observation of a round object flying in the sky. The object was seen at approx 10,000 feet, moving in an easterly direction at an estimated speed of 700 mph. The object was estimated to be approximately 30 feet in diameter and appeared to the witness as a luminous glowing ball in the sky. The object was under observation for a period of 20 minutes.
COMMENTS:
This account appears to be more authentic than the one reported on 6 August 1952. The witness, a Finland pilot, Captain - U.S.A.F., is considered a reliable source. No definite conclusions are being drawn at this time. However, the similarity between this and the 6 August 1952 incidents, since they are approximately 200 miles south of the Lake Huron sightings, a strong possibility exists that the 'light colored spheres' being observed over Lake Huron may be of the same phenomenon, which has intensified since 17 July, according to the local press, are being called "flying saucers". An in depth analysis will be forthcoming.

PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES

ATIL OFFICE, D/I FEAF

Statement of 1st Lt. Wesley R. Holder

At 0000I, I was scrambled to investigate an unidentified object reported by a central tower operator at Haneda. The object was reported to be in the Tokyo Bay area. It observed nothing at this time. At 0045I the object was estimated to be at an altitude of 5,000 feet, traveling at a speed of 220 degrees and directed to look for. When I reached the object's position, it seemed to disappear from radar contact at 10 degrees port at 6000 yards. The point of view rapidly from port to starboard and disappeared from the scope. I had no visual contact with the target. Soon after this contact the search was abandoned, as it continued to search the Tokyo Bay area indefinitely until 0215 hours. Another Lockheed P-80 was scrambled at this time. The object was observed to be traveling at 660-70 miles an hour. The only known air traffic at the time was a C-54 in the pattern at Haneda and another C-54 over Johnson about 35 minutes later.

State of 1st Lt. Aaron M. Jones

At 0000I, Lt. Holder and I were scrambled to investigate an unidentified target encountered on radar west of Tokyo Bay. As we were approaching the OCCI Hi Junction, we observed a single stationary light at 10 o'clock position. We then started a starboard searching orbit under GCI control south east of Haneda. At 0015, a GCI link gave us a vector of 320 degrees. At this time we observed a stationary radar echo and gave us the vector to intercept the unidentified target which appeared to be at an altitude of 3,000 feet and an approximate distance of 6,000 yards. The target was rapidly moving from port to starboard and a turn was made in an attempt to intercept, but the target disappeared. No definite radar echo and we continued our search over Tokyo Bay. At 0030 Hi link released us from scrambled mission. The only other aircraft interrogated during this mission was a C-54. This aircraft was identified as a C-54 on course of 250 degrees altitude 5,000 feet and look like maintaining a normal traffic pattern. We noticed nothing of unusual nature from this time until we landed at 0120.

STATEMENT

At approximately 2330 hours, 5 August 1952, while on duty as Controller of Detachment #4, 532nd Aircraft Control & Warning Group, I received a call from Harcida tower operator that they could see a bright light out over Tokyo Bay. Northeast of their station at approximately 1000 to 1500 feet.

I relayed this information to ADCC and started checking for an indication on the radar scope on both high and low beam. There were three (3) or four (4) blips on low beam but none I could definitely get a reading on or none I could get a reading on the HRI scope.

At 2345 hours I was relieved by Lt. Albert.

STATEMENT
The undersigned officer reported for work at Sta #1, dt 23159F, 5 August 1952. Controller being relieved informed me of an unusual sighting reported to him by Antenna Operator. This was reported to me as being a lighted object hovering NE of Haneda. After discussion with ADDC controller, it was decided that an OCR should be germinated.
At the time of scramble, I had what was believed to be the object in radar contact. The target as picked up indicated the object to be due south of this station over Tokyo Bay and approximately eight (8) miles NE of Haneda. The target was at a slight angle below horizon at the time.
The F-94 reported in airborne at GOKU, 5 August 1952, the call sign was Sun Dial 20. Sun Dial 20 was vectored to the object and maintain 5,000 feet as the time. I had negative radar contact with the target. Sun Dial 20 reported sighting and visual contact with the object but could not identify it due to the unusual occurrences. The object was again sighted by radar at GOLI7I on a star-board circuit in the same area as before. Sun Dial 20 was vectored to the target. He reported contact at 00251 and reported looking contact at 00256. Sun Dial 20 followed the target into the ground and no contact was made any longer.
Both target were using GYRO, reporting evasive and rapid maneuvers. This again resumed his visual search. ADOC controller during and following occurrence was unable to give any further assistance. All the above information was reported to ADOC controller during and following the incident.
Members of my crew were outside at reported time of above occurrences and were unable to sight anything unusual. All of the above information was reported to ADOC Controller during and following the incident.
Type radar used at this station is AN/CPS-1 and AN/CPS-H. Both pieces of equipment appeared to be functioning normally. Slight information was unavailable due to nearness of target to our clutter area.

STATEMENT OF LT. L. HENRY E. ALBERT, CONTROLLER AT SHIROI (CONT'D)

The F-94 departed in airborne at CGOAF, 6 August 1952, the call sign was Sun Dial 20 was ordered to investigate a radar target 20 miles east north east and maintain 2,000 feet at this time. It had negative radar contact with the target. Sun Dial 20 was ordered to remain in the general area. The target as picked up by radar at CGOAF on a static and erratic in the circling flight by radar scope. It could not be chased or photographed. An attempt was made by Sun Dial 20 to close on the target but it was unable to sight anything unusual. All of the above information was reported to AISS Controller, who was unable to sight anything unusual. All of the above information was reported to AISS Controller, who was unable to sight anything unusual.

Type radar used at this station is AN/CPS-1 and AN/CPS-4. Both pieces of equipment were functioning normally. However, due to heaviness of traffic to our clutter areas, correlation of target information was unsatisfactory.

Lt. Henry E. Albert is stationed at Shiroi and is not immediately available to give corrective statement.

The initial sighting of the object was orange in color, which gradually changed to an opalescer greenish blue. The object was circular in shape, but was not as brilliant as the original orange color. The source could not tell the exact size of the object, and the aerodynamic characteristics could not be determined, nor was there any trail of the object, but compared to a 14cm anti-aircraft tracer fired at its trajectory, he was familiar with the observed flight path, nature and speed of the object, which he judged to be greater than 500 mph, and at an altitude of 10,000 (5,000) feet. The sky was clear with a full moon shining at the time of observation. ETIME estimated the strange object was sighted at thirty (30) seconds. At the same time that SOURCE saw the object, he also saw an aircraft SOURCES estimated as twenty-five hundred (2,500) to three thousand (3,000) feet above the object. He identified the aircraft as an F-51 type. He said the unidentified object was characteristic entity, and also very rapid in its movements, but did not describe or identify the aircraft further.
2. SOURCE observed the object for approximately thirty (30) seconds, at 2300 hours, 5 August 1952.
3. SOURCE observed the object visually.
4. The point of observation was from SOURCE's bedroom window which faced due south and the location of source is approximately two (20) miles south of Valdosta, Georgia. (30/SCN-83/17). From where SOURCE was standing at the window, the object was at an angle of forty-five (45) degrees above his head.
5. SOURCE appeared "willing and gave his answers in a straightforward manner". His manner to the interviewer was found to be sincere and cooperative. He appeared to be an honest and truthful individual for fifteen (15) years, all this time as a photographer. He was an aerial photographer in the ALEUTIANS during World War II, and was a photographer on OPERATIONS CROSSROADS in 1946. He had returned from Korea on 1 March 1952, after eighteen (18) months there as PHOTO RECONNAISSANCE COORDINATOR. 
6. A check with the Moody Air Force Base weather station confirmed the weather conditions on the night of the sighting to be ceiling and visibility unlimited; winds aloft conditions unknown. A full moon was present at the time of the sighting.
7. Negative.

STATEMENT:
TO : When It May Concern

I, Frank C. Waterman, Master Sergeant AF690727B, do make the following statement of my own free will.

On the night of 5 August 1952, I was aroused from sleep by my wife, Helen C. Waterman, to observe an lighted object from our bed room window. The time was 2300 hours and the visibility very good for there was a full moon at that hour and also few or no clouds. The bedroom window faces due North and the location of the house is approximately ten (10) miles South of Valdosta, Georgia.

This lighted object appeared to be orange in color when first observed and gradually turned bluilsh green or yellowish as it went away from sight. The course of this object was a North by North-East and was judged by me to be between forty-five hundred (4,500) and five thousand (5,000) feet. The speed of this object is very difficult for me to approximate but I would judge it to be similar to that of a 40MM shell (tracer) traveling at a flat trajectory. The altitude of this object was also computed by me to that of a 40MM shell, which I judged to explode at five thousand (5,000) feet. The shape of this object was circular and not defined as to outline. I would estimate the total time of observation to be about thirty seconds from my angle of view, until the object completely disappeared.

At the same time as I observed the fore-mentioned object, a jet type of aircraft with flashing red and green lights, was seen and heard by me passing over head in the same general heading as the object and at a slightly higher altitude of approximately seventy-five hundred (7,500) to eight thousand (8,000) feet.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects
DATE OF INFORMATION: 6 AUGUST 1952
PLACE: PORTAUSTIN, MICH.
SOURCE: Lt. Col. Ralph L. Broun, Air Attache, Lima, Peru
ON 5 AUGUST 1952 A PRIVATE PILOT, CAPTAIN [REDACTED], REPORTED A SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS OVER LAKE HURON (APPROX 30 MILES SE OF PORTAUSTIN, MICH.) AT 1:13 PM EDT. HE ESTIMATED THE SIZE OF THE OBJECTS TO BE APPROXIMATELY 3000 FEET. 
THIS ACCOUNT APPEARS TO BE MORE AUTHENTIC THAN THE ONE REPORTED ON 4 AUGUST 1952. HOWEVER, THE FACT THAT A SIMILAR SIGHTING WAS REPORTED AS HAVING OCCURRED ON THAT DATE LENDS SOME DOUBT AS TO THE TRUE RELIABILITY OF THE PRESENT SIGHTING. THE LOCATION OF THE SIGHTING, HOWEVER, COINCIDES WITH A RECENT PUBLICITY IN THE STATES OF "FLYING SAUCERS" WHICH HAS INTENSIFIED PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE MATTER.

ID-23 1 65-3

In physical appearance with that of the first object, followed the same course of sighting, gaining in brightness and taking on a more round or elliptical shape. The seeming disappearance of the first object was the cause for noticing the second object.

a. GAYVR's residence is located approximately one (1) mile northwest of the center of Belfast, Maine, and is across the city of Belfast, Maine, and is approximately 1/2 mile from the harbor.

b. At 1930 hours on 5 August 1952, the sky was overcast, and visibility was limited somewhat by a drizzle. Both this sighting was reported over the harbor just north of the city of Belfast, Maine.

JACKSON advised that he and his wife observed the phenomenon of two unidentified flying objects from their residence just north of the city of Belfast, Maine, which are docked and anchored in the harbor just north of the city of Belfast, Maine, and it is not unusual for searchlights to be reflected against the clouds.

JACKSON advised that GAYVR, a person who has been described as reliable, claimed that the lights seen by him appeared to be larger than the searchlights, and that no reports of other persons having observed unusual objects in the sky had been received.

ACTION:
Two (2) copies of this report will be forwarded to the Commanding General, Air Technical Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. Attention is invited, and one (1) information copy forwarded to the Commanding General, Air Force, Washington, D.C. No further action is contemplated by this District Office.

Air Intelligence Information Report
IR-52
8 August 1952

The text in the document is as follows:

LT KEARNEY, LIEUT FORT

1. In accordance with existing instructions, the following information is submitted:

SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
On 6 August 1952, the control tower operator at CRTC Ft. Custer, Michigan, observed a "clear sky" moving in a westerly direction at a speed of "1,000 miles per hour" for 2 to 3 seconds. This was reported to be high altitude and the object was observed in the daytime. There were no sound or trail effects noted. 

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE OBSERVATION:
The observer, a pilot with several years experience, stated that the object was "disc-shaped", silver in color, and had no wings or tail. It was very small in size and appeared to be a solid object. This officer is considered reliable and his report has been checked closely. No other witnesses were available.

EVALUATION:
The presence of the object described, as reported, coincides with published information on similar flying objects. It is this agency's belief that the reported sighting represents an actual phenomena and is not an illusion or misinterpretation of a known object. However, the source of these flying objects is indeterminate at this time. Such reports merit close study and evaluation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended that this report be forwarded to the proper authorities for further study and analysis. No further action is contemplated at this station.
