Page 2 Incident: ____
Name and Addre.e of Observer:

Description and method:

Source of Information: Airfield-Suisun AFB, Calif
                       Control Tower Operator
                       FFC, USAF
Reliability of Source: Considered fully reliable and a competent airman. Sighting
also witnessed by [REDACTED] Sgt AF [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] OIC
considers them high type individuals fully qualified both mentally and
physically for control tower duty. Considered competent, reliable observers
psychologically stable.

OBJECT IN SIGHT:

Object first got into view about 2 miles north of the Control Tower
flying at low altitude between 500 & 4000 ft, climbing on a low trajectory
with a speed estimated in excess of 1000 MPH. Immediately after sighting 
[REDACTED] remained to east side of tower. By this time object was estimated
to be not more than 1500 feet altitude and its speed had slowed for several
seconds to perhaps 200 MPH. At this state object had a very slight undulating
or bouncing motion. When in position oriented with the Line between the
tower and the air freight terminal, but a slight distance east of the terminal,
the object took off almost vertical rise or climb and leveled off again
at an estimated 3000 ft. At this point [REDACTED]
watching as PFC [REDACTED] attempted to summon the AACS operations Officer.
Sgt [REDACTED] reported the object almost immediately afterward started a
fast climb toward the south-southeast and reached about 20,000 ft at which
point he lost sight of it. PVT [REDACTED] never saw the object again after
leaving to phone.

Object was viewed thru 8-power binoculars, All that could be seen was a
circular light one to 2 feet in diameter. It had the intensity of a Ramp
floodlight and was so bright that it blanked out any silhouette (if any)
when sighted in binoculars. In size it was comparable to one of Fairfield-
Suisun AFB's high-intensity runway lights. No sound was herd nor was
any exhaust trail observed. The light was clearly seen with the naked eye
It was brilliant but by no means blinding. Observer (PVC [REDACTED]), was
convinced it was not an aircraft's navigation light. The night was clear,
and the wind indicated southwest at 10 MPH on tower instruments. A weather
balloon had been released 45 to 35 minutes previous to sighting but was
lost ten minutes after release.

STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED 12 January 1949

At the request of Chief of Intelligence, this undersigned wishes to describe as accurately as possible his impressions of the brief appearance of an unknown illuminated object which appeared over Fairfield-Suisun AFB at 2025 PST on 3 December 1948. The object first into view about 2 miles north of the control tower, flying at a low altitude between 500 and 1000 feet, climbing on a low trajectory, with a speed estimated at something in excess of 400 miles per hour. Immediately after sighting, this observer rushed to the east side of the tower. By this time the object was estimated to have not more than 1500 feet altitude and it's speed had slowed to several seconds to perhaps two-hundred (200) miles per hour. The observer can recall that a this stage the object had a very slight undulating or bouncing motion. When in this position overhead with a line between the tower and the air freight terminal, but a slight distance east of the terminal, the object took an almost vertical rise or climb and levellal off again at an estimated three thousand feet. At that time the other control-tower operator on duty continued watching, raised the lights in observatian throgh the AACS binoculars of the object on this business he reported that the object, upon motion checking with the operations be so that he might be able to get a look at it. The other tower operator reported the object last immediately afterwards started at a crash climb toward the south-southeast and reached about twenty thousand feet, at which point he lost sight of it. The undersigned never saw the object again after going for the telephone.

Pertinent information is that the light was clearly seen with the naked eye, brilliant but by no means blinding. In size it was comparable to one Traffic-field-sun AFB's high-intensity runway lights. The observer is convinced it was not an aircraft navigation light. The night was clear, and the wind was indicating southwest at 10 miles per hour on tower instruments.

I certify and affirm that the information herein is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and ability.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #218 -- Fairfield Suisan AFB, California -- 3 November 21.48

If the observations were exactly as stated by witnesses, 
this "ball of light" could not have been a fireball.  Moreover, 
astronomers receive several thousand reports of fireballs and 
they are prepared for almost any kind of a story.

Even trained observers are sometimes greatly fooled by
the illusion of closeness; cases are on record of fireballs which 
were reported to have fallen in adjacent fields, are usually seen
to span sigma 200 miles away.

A fireball would not come into view at 1000' and rise to
20,000'. If this observation is correct, an astronomical interpretation for the incident can be ruled out. Under unusual conditions 
a fireball might, however, appear to rise somewhat, as a result of 
perspective as it starts into the earth's atmosphere.

Absence of trail and sound definitely does not favor the 
meteoric hypothesis, but, as in many other cases, does not rule it
out with finality.

It does not seem likely that any known meteorological or 
auroral phenomenon would have been as bright as this object was 
reported to be.

In the almost hopeless sargasso of day-or-night-miracle, era- 
plasmoids(?), and other less respectable of the object's origin,
have to note, even though the description does not fit very well,

No. 215. Very high winds 60-70 M.P.H. from SW at all levels,
definitely would have prohibited any balloon from making any southerly
motion. Also, last scheduled released time was three hours prior to
sighting at 1,000 feet. No time in sight given so cannot compute rate
of climb to 20,000 feet. Fairly conclusive, not a balloon of any kind.

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MCIAXX, dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents summaries 173 through 233 have been checked against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide To Investigation Of Unidentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Disposition of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and horizontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move. "Relative to Radar Settings" should include a statement of the type of radar set used.

with total evidence thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four which contain some evidence tending to disprove ready explanation. This section is true only under the assumption that the evidence is accepted as reliable and accurate, without psychological and physical factors not known to, considered by, or of significance to ATIC. Evidence taken strictly as published in T/I and: C/S, or from files of ATC Material Command Intelligence, February 1949 (see ende T/I).

All "Hoax" (101) and "Psychological" (see below) (102 Time date censored)

There is very significant psychological explanations for most of the discredited flying objects to provide plausible disentangles from reports not otherwise explainable. They serve to identify the trivial frauds which any free press allows to attain types and phase. 

Also all (see remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail in separate "report. 34 is incidents form no pattern in regard to area of the type of officer or manner of person. There army indications hey, these few sightings were influenced by earlier reports...probably not as been accumulated until or projected on any problem.

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix "B") are of a certain unproveable. Two of them, by statements of the reporter only a few minutes interval with no other note of it; one a solitary incident in LA. (See- most distributed without problem throughout the United States. Few were observed in the S, to give descriptions of appearance or performance was exactly alike. The reported sightings occurred at various times of day and years.

In the following section of this reports, each remaining unexplained incident is considered one at a time. This lends itself to general character of observers, but each case has two individual a pattern as yet to be determined.
