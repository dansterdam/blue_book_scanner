The image contains two diagrams. The first diagram is a sketch that shows the observer's perspective of an unidentified object in the sky. The second diagram is a compass rose.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the horizon line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass to show where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
