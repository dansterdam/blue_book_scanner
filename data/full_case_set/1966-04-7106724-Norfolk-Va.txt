(4) When first sighted, the object appeared to be bouncing or oscillating until it was directly in front of the observer, where it seemed to stop and hover. A small, brilliant light appeared to leave the bottom of the larger object and descend into the water, where it was no longer visible. The larger object then appeared to ascend and hover over the spot where the smaller object had descended and hovered once more.
