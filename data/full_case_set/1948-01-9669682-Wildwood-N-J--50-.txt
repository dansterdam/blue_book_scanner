C. L. ADAIR, C.E.M., USCG


1. On date of 1 April, 1948, this investigator proceeded to Wildwood, N.J. for
the purpose of investigating subject incidents.

2. Donahavin Charles, in charge of Hereford Inlet L. B. Station was contacted,
who had heard nothing in regards to strange objects having appeared in the
air in the vicinity of Wildwood. He agreed to check up on his own and felt that,
due to a 24 hour tower watch being maintained at the station, some of his men
should have observed such incidents. He was again contacted on date of
5 April, 1948 and he stated none of his men had observed any strange objects and had heard nothing about them. Large Foot registered, had also made discreet
inqueries at the local American Legion Post & was told by reputable business
men with negative results. He is told quite positive that, if the incidents
had occurred on several occasions, some Foots have been sure to have heard of it, as
others would have observed the objects.

3. Chief Torris Donatavein was contacted on data of 3 April, 1948, he
stated that he had received no reports about the matter and had heard no local
talk regarding same. Mr. Torris, group commander, Atlantic City L.B. Station,
stated that he would contact the crew-members of the several stations under his
command to learn if any of the tower look-outs had observed such phenomena.
Mr. Torris was again contacted on date of 5 April, 1948 and he had learned that
none of the men at his group of stations had observed or reported any strange
objects in the sky or water, or at sea. He is quite sure occurrences had happened
on several occasions, his station men should have observed same.

4. A visit was made to the Wildwood American Legion Home and a personal talk
was had with its members who stated in summary, who said that never remember
any mention by Post members, of strange aerial phenomena having been observed
in the vicinity of Wildwood. A member said that in his tower would soon be
a common matter of discussion had local folks observed real silvers.

Aerial phenomena at Wildwood, N.J.,
Report of Investigation
7 April, 1948

5. The Wildwood, N.J., Police Department was visited. Captain
of Police, A. L. Pocccum, stated that the department maintained four
police cars on 24 hour continuous patrol and a watchman on the board-
walk on 24 hour duty. None of his men had reported observing any
strange aerial phenomena and he firmly believed that if such things
had occurred on several occasions, it would have been observed and
reported by the police or by private citizens in a town as small as
Wildwood.

6. The Wildwood Crest, N.J., Police Department was visited. They
had heard nothing and received no reports about aerial phenomena in
the vicinity. This small borough also maintains a 24 hour police car
patrol.

7. The American Legion Club and Post Home at Cape Hay, N.J., was
visited. The manager and steward, Mr. --------, had heard nothing
about aerial phenomena having been observed in or about this town which
is along the coast and a short distance south of Wildwood.

3. An interview was had with Mrs. --------, mentioned in corre-
spondence to the Hq, U.S.A.F., as having witnessed the incidents, at her
second floor apartment at -------------, Wildwood, N.J. She informed
that she only observed one incident, that of the evening of
7 January, 1948, at about ten o'clock, her attention was produced by
a Glover she had written or who, not named, came in as follows; it and a
TV living room window a most unusual thing drop out of the sky, I think
it was a flying saucer as I have never seen anything equal to it before,
apparently it droped in the ocean. I live about 500 feet from the
boardwalk and beach. This thing fell south of Cape Mayne roads,
Wildwood avenue. I have been asked over the radio to let you know of
anything unusual," Mrs. -------- stated that this Mrs. -------- was visiting
her in Mrs. -------- apartment on this particular evening and it was
Mrs. -------- who called Mrs. -------- attention to the object in the sky.
Mrs. -------- stated that what she observed appeared to be two round
orange colored discs or balls, one very being smaller than the
body so light appeared to be than the normally annoying to, and in a
slow and steady manner until disappearing from sight (the sky, from
Mrs. -------- apartment living room, is to the south in the general direction
of the Coast Guard Air station at Cap May, N.J.). Mrs. -------- placed
a small -------- for the approximate position the object or -------- getting
in 10 January, 1948, in this position and with the limits imposed by
her standing porch-roof window of vision from about 22 to 29
altitude. Mrs. -------- stated the objects were visible for from 3 to 5
to 6 seconds before disappearing from view, -------- before there were 
two objects, apparently related, but then, -------- informed --------, she saw

nearly every evening and since the incident of 10 January, 1948 she has
kept a good watch but has observed nothing since. Mrs. ****** appeared
to be a normal person of about 55 years of age.

9. Efforts were made to contact Mrs. ***** *****, residing at the

result, and it was presumed that she was out of town, although she had

Downfall rates with regard to real estate, all have the motive of seeing
several separate incidents of aerial phenomena between the dates of
27 December, 1947 and 11 March, 1948, all in the company of her son,
with the exceptions the one incident of 10 January, 1948 at which time
Mrs. ****** was also a witness.)

Incident #50, 50a -- Wildwood, New Jersey -- 10 January 1948

In view of the unbalanced character or at least one of
the observers (as indicated by the report of the interview), this
investigator wonders how much credence can be given to the reports
of two objects or objects cited. For instance, two summary stats
that the first object was in sight 5-3 seconds, while two interview
indicates l5-20 minutes. Assuming that this first incident was
authentic and the shorter time correct (it evidently being the
estimate given by the second observer), there is nothing in the
evidence that is contradictory to the notion that the object ob-
served was nothing more than a slow-moving fireball. The color,
splitting into two pieces, and manner of disappearance all support 
this view.

Objects were brought to Mrs. [redacted] attention by Mrs. [redacted] who
saw "a most unusual thing drop out of the sky. I think it was a flying 
saucer as I have never seen anything equal to it before!" She then states that 
she saw what appeared to be 2 round orange colored discs or balls, the one 
being smaller, and that these objects appeared to descend vertically toward 
the earth in a slow and steady manner until disappearing from their sight.
Mrs. [redacted] stated that she saw one object with two objects (apparently related), but 
that they were originally one object which separated at about the time Mrs. 
[redacted] sighted it.

All witnesses+ (Mrs. [redacted], her son and Mrs. [redacted]) agree on the following:

Color and size - that of an old-fashioned gas light which had a yellow, red or 
amber shade. Outline was distinct and did not appear false 
or irregular. No noise or sound of kind. No smoke or exhaust 
trails seen. Swam[e] oval to round, all stated. No motion pattern 
not to their knowledge a balloon, dirigible, flare, or parachute 
or any other known object and all seemed to have a pretty good 
knowledge as to the appearance of the foregoing.

NOTE: Witness appeared calm and normally sensible in her responses to various 
questions.

1. As a result of a letter received from Miss ***** regarding an incident
in connection with Project "SIGN", a personal interview was considered necessary. Re-
cent visits to military bases where these incidents take place and results obtained by
personal contact with witnesses indicate the necessity for this trip to **********, N.J.
This city is located in a remote part of New Jersey and is not readily accessible by
ordinary transportation means. It was decided, therefore, that travel by military air
was more expeditious.

2. A teletype was sent to Miss ***** 6 February 1948 indicating thst a visit would
be made on or about 15 February for an interview. It is necessary, therefore, to ac-
complish this mission as a result of the arrangements with Miss *****

UNCLASSIFIED

6. Mrs. █████'s family consisted of four children, three boys and one
girl, one of the boys having died several years ago, and who would now be
approximately 27 years old. One son and daughter were in the service
during World War II. The younger son apparently was too young to be a ser-
viceman. During the ten minutes that he was observed, he appeared normal
in every respect, and was typical for a young man of 21 years of age. It
is our understanding that Mrs. █████ is deceased and may have left some in-
surance money and provided some other income so that Mrs. █████ and her son
could live moderately at this resort, because no statement was made as to any
business activity of her own.

7. Mrs. █████ apparently did not marry until World War I while travel-
ing in Europe as a representative of the Red Cross. There she met a Hungarian
who had three sons. They were RAF pilots during World War II and all were
killed. Her present son, █████, who is 21 years old, received all the in-
heritance from his step brothers and also from his father who is also
deceased. Mrs. █████ boasted how well off her son is as a result of the in-
heritance of property and money. Mrs. █████ claimed that she had no financial
worries of any kind, and therefore could devote all her time toward knitting
and standardizing various designs of woollen article of apparel.

8. Mrs. █████ took the initiative in frequently relating about strange
happenings in the town of Wildwood for a number of years, including such
things as submarine sights, numerous activities in and out reported landings of
so-called spies by submarines during World War II, and peculiar activities of
many alleged inhabitants world by that practically all the rest is in
Philadelphia area. In that connection three well posted factual steps showing
They both explained that Wildwood is primarily a summer resort and therefore,
the town is rather vacated during the off-season period during which time the
recent popular activities take place. They claim, therefore, that the flying 
dis is some other kind of aerial approach to carry out adverse activities 
by a fereign country. They firmly believe that a recent horital fire that 
started in the roof was caused by the flying discs. A description of the 
discs was not clearly presented as to the shape; however, it was what one 
would except from such individuals not having a technical background and the 
inability of other competent observers to describe exactly what they have 
seen. The best description as to shape and color was that of an oval or tear-
drop shaped object this design, but with no one to verify its true use. The 
one in Wildwood was a pointed out during a walk to Mrs. █████'s apartment as
localized and might be this design again likened by ███ claw like its but may 
thought she said was about the same from where they were viewing it. They 
not say exactly what the actual dimensions were as they could not judge the 
distance.

9. Mrs. █████ was not certain that the objects flow directly over any 
particular house, although they appeared to do that. Both Mrs. █████ and 
█████ █████ said that the object could have had had a considerable el-
lasion, by that, they meant over the open water just below Cape May, and
that the objects would always come from the open water approach over Cape May, 
and then follow the waterway up towards the general direction of Philadelphia. 
All witnesses stated that where witnessed only one incident, at which time the 
seperation of two objects occurred. Her description tallied somewhat in that

15. During the interview, Mrs. ████ frequently hinted about corre-
sponding with President Truman, the well-known commentator Drew Pearson,
and other officials regarding the incidents, and insisting that some action
be taken, and that she was not interested in any reflection it might bring
on the town of Wildwood which always had a bad reputation. Her chief con-
cern was for the national security.

The image contains a scanned page from a document with typewritten text and redactions. There is no photograph present in the image. Below is the text extracted from the document:

Birmingham, Alabama newspaper photographs of two objects having a general 
oval shape where the leading one was approximately three times the six of 
the rear object which seemed to be attached or following very closely and 
separated at a distance of about two or three lengths of the small object. 

10, Mrs. █████ pointed out how this object was brought to her atten-
tion while sitting in the second floor and looking out through the window in 
a southerly direction when the two objects were seen floating slowly across 
the horizon and then suddenly separating and disappearing below the house 
tops. She could not state that they dropped in somebody's backyard or even 
on the ground, but that they simply dropped slowly from view and were not 
seen again. Mrs. █████ however, thought that one object separated or brok'n 
in two and dropped from view. 

11, Mrs. █████ son, █████ who also claimed to have seen the objects, 
agreed with Mrs. █████ and Mrs. █████ that the color appeared to be the 
same as a yellow, red or amber colored flashlight. This but little 
we stated that it was not one that would appear flame and irregulat. They all 
stated that it was not a frightening thing, but seemed to be very quietly 
and peacefully moving along, coming from a high altitude over the water in 
a downward slow moving path toward the shore and then lightly rising again 
and rapidly disappearing in the distance in the general direction of Phila-
delphia.

12. The object appeared to be in view far at least 15 to 20 minutes on 
each occasion Mrs. █████ stated once that she had seen it approximately 20 
times, but upon further questioning as to the exact number of times, she re-
duced it to about 5 times, according to the following schedule! 25 and 28 
Dec 47, 3 and 10 Jan, and 13 Feb. Mrs. █████ stated that the Coast Guard 
visited that vicinity ie. Wildwood' and 10 Jan to view the next occurrences, 
but evidently did not see anything. 

13. A map of the town showing the layout of the city blocks and streets 
was presented to indicate the direction of objects which was brought back a 
part of the case for the purpose. They stated that no noise or sound of 
any kind was emitted; no smoke or exhaust trails were seen. They also in-
sisted that it was not any balloon, dirigible, flare, parachute or any other
thing that they knewl and they seemed to have a pretty good knowledge as to 
the appearance of such things. They claimed it was something they had never 
seen before. They could not describe it accurately, but they assured us it 
was very real. 

14. Mrs. █████ sent this hq a latter dated 16 Feb transmitting a copy 
of "Mirts and Crafts" published by MacMillan Company that carried an article 
about her activity in the writing filed, which substantiated most of her 
statements in this respect, Also inclosed was a book entitled "Hand-
book of █████'s" written by her and published by Consolidated Book

SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

TO: Chief, Air Weather Service,
    Andrews Air Force Base,
    Washington 25, D. C.
    ATTN: DCS

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investi-
gation and interpretation of data relative to sighting of unidentified
flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries 1 thru 172 from the files
of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendations as to
which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine
synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological
Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached
may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that
has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except
that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball
lightning. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are
conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are
obtained by the Intelligence Department of this Command. Those checks
usually made direct from the Project "SIGN" Office, MXC1LXO-3. These
checks are distinct from the check of synoptic balloon flights made by
Weather Service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department
of Commerce, (U.S.Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed inci-
dents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This
list does not eliminate the possibility that many of the remaining
incidents are balloons.

     a. Eyeglasses          Yes          No
     b. Sun glasses         Yes          No

26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or ob-
jects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The last line of the document contains characters that seem to be individually placed, rather than forming a coherent sentence or phrase. They read: "A T U B E W I T H A N A N T E N N A O N T O P." This could possibly represent an attempt to describe the shape of the observed UFO as a tube with an antenna on top, expressed in a disjointed manner.

The image contains two diagrams. The first diagram shows a protractor-like angle measurement from 0 to 90 degrees, with trees at the bottom, and two points labeled "A" and "B" indicating the apparent trajectory of an object above the horizon. The second diagram is a compass rose with points "A" and "B" indicating a change in direction of an object's movement.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

UNCLASSIFIED

An Incident Reported In Cincinnati
Summary

A letter dated 19 June 1950 was received from a
Mr. ******* reporting a flying contraption
which, according to his letter, was found in his back 
yard. Photographs enclosed indicated the incident was
a hoax. However, since it could not be explained,
based on the evidence available, the matter was refer-
red to OSI.

Upon checking, it was found the originator was no
longer in Cincinnati. After a search half around the
country it was finally determined that the object re-
ported was built of scrap materials and reported as a 
joke.

UNCLASSIFIED

1. In an interview, ------, service station operator, said
that he found the object referred to in previous reports as "Man undec-
iphered material object", about 2 years ago. This object was found behind
------ TAVERN in Warren. The "machine" was obviously made from various
objects, such as an old washing machine cover, parts of a tube or chassis
of a TV set and spark plugs set in a "violet ray" unit. The object had
been treated very roughly by youths throughout the countryside, and, as a joke, the
men at ------ ranch had it dangling beneath a large model airplane which
the boys local youngsters, also intended to give the object to found to
the newspaper for display. ------, later forgot about it and eventually had
someone take it to a local ------ with other lines of junk. Before he
did so, however, ------ at ------ had had the object in ------, and he
object and apparently believed he had some -----. ------ took photo-
graphs of the object with ------ holding it. ------ believed the object
actually had been made by ------ local, initially.

2. He had not made the "aerial object" himself but he had only "rigged it"
that he had not made the "aerial object" himself but had only "rigged it"
to the "tail pipe" of his contraption with a welding torch, at the request of
the "mail manager" of the local Glass to Coach hardware store. This was
done to make it appear that hot gases had been discharged from the pipes.

3. ------ was out of town on the day the agent visited Warren, but in
an interview ------, at clerk at the Court by Coach store, ---- ---- ----
submittedly ---- a radio repairman, and himself, had made the
the object as a joke about 2 years ago. In addition to the parts listed in
the first paragraph, the makers also utilized parts of a welded broader
stove and miscellaneous scraps.

AGENTS NOTE: In view of the above information, no attempt was made
to locate this "aerial object". According to ---- ---- ----
it would be almost impossible to do so in view of the
large mound of steel at the city dump, which also is
periodically covered over with earth by a bulldozer.

ADDITIONS TO THE ABOVE REPORT ARE AS FOLLOWS:

Dear Sir:

I am anxious to know what this contraption is. It was 
found with its point buried in the hard ground in my
home town some time ago.

I have enclosed my return addressed envelope for an
answer and the snap shots.

Yours most sincerely,

---
Birmingham, Alabama newspaper photographs of two objects having a general oval shape where the leading one was approximately three times the size of the other object which seemed to be attached or following very closely and separated at a distance of about two or three lengths of the smaller object.

10. Mrs. █████████ pointed out how the objects was brought to her attention while sitting in the second floor and looking out through the window in a southerly direction, when the two objects were seen floating slowly across the horizon and then suddenly separating and disappearing below the house tops. She could not state that they dropped in somebody's backyard or even on the ground, but that they simply dropped slowly from view and were not seen again. Mrs. ███████, however, thought that one object separated or broke in two and dropped from view.

11. Mrs. █████ █████, who also claimed to have seen the objects, agreed with Mrs. █████ and Mrs. █████ that the color appeared to be the same as a yellow, red, or amber colored flashlight and that the outline was distinct and not one that would appear as flame and irregular. They all stated that it was not a frightening thing, but seemed to be very quietly and peacefully moving along, coming from a high altitude over the water in a downward slowly moving path toward the shore and then lightly rising again and rapidly disappearing in the distance in the general direction of Philadelphia.

12. The object appeared to be in view for at least 15 to 20 minutes on each occasion, Mrs. █████ stated once that she had seen it approximately 20 times, but upon further questioning as to the exact number of times, she reduced it to about 5 times, according to the following schedule: 25 and 28 Dec, 47, 3 and 10 Jan, and 13 Feb. Mrs. █████ stated that the Coast Guard visited that vicinity to investigate and to view the next occurrences, but evidently did not see anything.

13. A map of the town showing the layout of the city blocks and streets was presented to indicate the direction of objects which was brought back as part of the case for future reference. They stated that it was not any sort of party object was emitted; no smoke or exhaust trails were seen. They also insisted that it was not any balloon, dirigible, flare, parachute or any other thing that they know, and they seemed to have a pretty good knowledge as to the appearance of such things. They claimed it was something they had never seen before. They could not describe it accurately, but they assured us it was very real.

14. Mrs. █████ sent this HQ a letter dated 16 Feb transmitting a copy of "Hints and Crafts" published by Macmillan Company that carried an article about her activity in the writing field, which substantiates that she is of sound mind in this respect. Also inclosed was a booklet entitled "It Happens Every so Often... What Will They Say?" written by her and published by Consolidated Book Publishers.

SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

TO: Chief, Air Weather Service,
Andrews Air Force Base,
Washington 25, D. C.
ATTN: DSC

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investigation and interpretation of data relative to sighting of unidentified flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries 1 through 172 from the files of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendation as to which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball lightning. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are organized by the Intelligence Department of this Command. These checks are usually made direct from the Project "SIGN" Office, MCUXO-3. These checks are distinct from the check of synoptic balloon flights made by weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department of Commerce. (U.S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed incidents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This list does not eliminate the possibility that any of the remaining incidents are balloons.

The image contains a sketch, not a photograph. The sketch appears to be a visual aid for reporting the observation of an unspecified flying object. It shows two arced scales representing elevation angles from the observer's point of view. The left scale has angles marked from 15° to 90°, and the right scale is in the form of a compass showing cardinal directions. On the left arced scale, two points "A" and "B" are marked, indicating the initial and final elevation angles of the object's observed path. On the compass scale, point "A" is marked on the "N" indicating North, and point "B" is marked between "NE" and "E" which indicates the Northeast and East directions.

An Incident Reported In Cincinnati
Summary

A letter dated 19 June 1950 was received from a 
Mr.__________ reporting a flying contraption
which, according to his letter, was found in his back
yard. Photographs enclosed indicated the incident was
a hoax. However, since it could not be explained,
based on the evidence available, the matter was refer-
red to OSI.

Upon checking, it was found the originator was no
longer in Cincinnati, After a search half around the
country it was finally determined that the object re-
ported was built of scrap materials and reported as a
joke.

UNCLASSIFIED

1. In an interview, [REDACTED], service station operator, said
that he found the object, referred to in previous reports as "an unidentified
aerial object", about 2 years ago. The object was found behind
[REDACTED] Tavern in Warren. The "machine" was obviously made from various
objects, such an old washing machine, parts of a radio, a silo chute,
sieves, and a spark plug, welded together. At the time there
was great excitement nationwide on "flying saucers" or objects and as a joke the
object was talked of by his customers throughout the country and as a joke the
object was taken everywhere on a slightly varicies [sic] parallel schedule which was to
be kept local "sightings" places, intended to give the object its found to
the newspaper for display along with other lines of junk. Before the
source took it to the local [REDACTED] who had charge lived in Warren, so he
did so however, [REDACTED] taking several [REDACTED] took photos-
object and apparently believed it had some [REDACTED] then believed the object
was of this object with [REDACTED] holding it. [REDACTED] the object
actually had been made by [REDACTED] Local, initially.

2. [REDACTED], Warren, Minnesota, stated in an interview
that he had not made the "aerial object" himself but had only "triggered"
the "mail plot" of our conversation with a writing both, at the request of
[REDACTED], manager of the local Gambles to head hardware store. This was
done to where it appear that hot gases had been discharged from the pipes.

3. [REDACTED] was out of town on the day [REDACTED] visited Warren, but in
an interview [REDACTED clerk at the Court by Clouds store, and
[REDACTED], a radio repairman, and himself, had made to
the object as a joke about 2 years ago. In addition to she parts listed in
the first paragraph, the makers also utilized part of a jukebox speaker
store and miscellaneous scraps.

ACTIONS NOTE: In view of the above [REDACTED], no attempt was made
to locate this "aerial object". According to [REDACTED]
it would be almost impossible to do so in view of the
large number of old items in the city dump, which also is
periodically covered over with earth by a bulldozer.

UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT
Cincinnati, Ohio

DEAR SIR:

AF CINCINNATI, OHIO

On 11 August 1950, Mr. [REDACTED] was interviewed regarding the unidentified aerial object
about which he wrote to the Air Force. He advised that Mr.
[REDACTED] who operates a service station on the main
highway in Warren, Minnesota, found this aerial object about
two (2) years ago in the vicinity of Warren, Minnesota and
informed photographed it just an hour or so after it was found.
He stated this it contains a fuel tank, three (3) tube radio,
and dry cells and that the opening at the rear of it appeared
to have vented hot gasses, causing informant to believe that it
had been jett or rocket propelled. He disclosed that it contained
no directional steering and had been completely covered with
aluminum paint. In examining this object, informant found
nothing to indicate its place of manufacture. He further stated
that his son [REDACTED] then the Walnut Hills High School,
Cincinnati, Ohio, and feels qualified to say that the main body
of the object was made in a press rather than by hand, which
indicates to him that it was a product of mass production. He
[REDACTED] advised that during the summer of 1950 he talked with
Mr. [REDACTED] who indicated that he still has the object in his
possession in Warren, Minnesote. Informant explained his delay
in contacting the Air Force by saying that it was many months
after he made the picture before someone suggested his writing
to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

The document contains three black-and-white photographs. The photographs are somewhat blurry and difficult to discern in detail, but I will describe them as accurately as possible:

1. The first photograph at the top left shows a person kneeling on the ground with what appears to be some kind of instruments or measuring equipment. There is also an item to their left on the ground, which could be part of the equipment or another object of interest. The label "Exhibit 'A'" can be seen below the image.

2. The second photograph at the top right shows a person lying face down on the ground, with their arms extended and a large round object, which may resemble a disk or saucer, resting on their back. There is also what looks like a piece of cloth or garment draped over the lower part of their body. The label "Exhibit 'B'" with a number, which is difficult to make out, appears beside the image.

3. The third photograph at the bottom mirrors the second one, with what seems to be the same person in the same position, again with the round disk-like object on their back. The lighting and contrast in this photograph make it harder to distinguish additional details. There does not appear to be a label with this photograph.

Unfortunately, due to the quality of the image and the level of detail presented, no further accurate descriptions can be given.

As for acting as an OCR system, the only discernible text in the document, apart from the "Exhibit" labels, appears to be illegible labels or numbers next to those labels, which are too unclear to read accurately. Thus, I'm unable to provide an OCR output for any additional text that might be present.
