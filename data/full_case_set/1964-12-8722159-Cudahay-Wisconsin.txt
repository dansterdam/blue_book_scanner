Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your recent letter in which you identified an object which you could not identify.

From the information which you submitted, the duration of the speeded up object would indicate a speed observation; however, the description including the color change is not considered valid since this would ordinarily indicate a time lapse photographs which is not in accordance with the flight path from northeast ending in the south unless there was a change in course of the object.

Analysts at the Project Blue Book Investigation office are unable to determine the cause of your report. However, as you were served in conjunction with the lunar eclipse on 19 December 1964. Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDEV

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (18 Dec 64, Cudahy, Wisconsin)

TO: Hq USAF SAPOR PB (Mr. [REDACTED])

1. Reference the attached letter from [REDACTED] reporting an unidentified flying object observed on 18 Dec 64 over Cudahy, Wisconsin.

2. Both the lunar eclipse of 18 Dec 64 was observed by many astronomers, and the observations could have been of some astronomical phenomena. Further explanations were made.

3. From the information which has been presented to us it seems that the description, as included, is in no way definitive. The description itself is not in accord with the flight path from northeast to south, unless there are changes in the course of the reported object.

4. Analysts are unable to determine the cause of his observation. However, we cannot assume there is any unusual object or phenomena was observed.

January 2 1965
Cudahy, Wisconsin

Dear Sir:
Upon thought it comes back that last year at New Years time I had a chance to see what was once described, might as well have been seen, as a strange object ascending in a large manner the sky, as if it was something quite usual to see such a thing, it did ascent rather slowly and gradually than with a sudden movement.

1) It was dark and airplan like 14 14 14 in the evening.
2) It alter its speed, size, changed in its brightness.
3) The object was a silver in color.
4) The color of the object changed.
5) The object was very fast.
6) As it ascended it seemed to speed up and come back toward the earth.
7) It seemed to start to rise over a period of 7 seconds.
8. It started in the north east and traveled in the motion east to west in the distance.

And I thank you for say, it helps me to know I was not just seeing a vision, cause many people of this area have said they have seen it at various times. I hope this report tells everything I saw, if you have any question, please let me know.

Yours truly
