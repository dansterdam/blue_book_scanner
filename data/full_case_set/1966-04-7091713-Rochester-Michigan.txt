The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and transcribe the text from the document:

"Gentlemen - 
On the night of 1-25-66 about 7:30 PM my husband and I were both outside when we observed a rather bright light that was travelling at a very high rate of speed. This light were (sic) green in color and about the size of a small dinner plate. It was green, but did not seem to be on anything. My husband was in the air force and he said no aircraft could travel that fast and be that small and be green. There was no sound. The light just appeared and disappeared."

"and are aware that your Chemical in association with a certain type of operation and wonder if their project is being tested in this manner."
