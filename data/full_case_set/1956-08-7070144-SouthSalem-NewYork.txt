6 September 1956

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

This is in reply to your letter of August 28, 1956, concerning your sighting of an unidentified flying object. We are still interested in these sightings. Enclosed is a USAF Technical Information Sheet for you to complete regarding the phenomenon you have observed.

Any aerial objects, so long as it remains unidentified, are of great concern to the Air Defense Command which is charged with the air defense of the United States. It has, for some time now, been the joint responsibility of the Air Defense Command and the Air Technical Intelligence Center to investigate unidentified flying objects and to correlate developments outside our own scientific knowledge.

It is requested that you forward the completed form directly to:

Air Technical Intelligence Center
Attention: AFOIN-4B4
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base

Your interest is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

TIMOTHY R. JOHNSON

The image contains a drawing of an object or objects on a path, but there is no photograph present in this particular document.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. 

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand (Circle One):
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Nickel
e. Quarter
f. Half dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22.)
a. Certain
b. Fairly certain 
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Slowly, gradually, suddenly, straight, or did it no longer visible?

24. In order that you may give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, would you please imagine that you could recreate a model of what you observed? Describe in your own words what that model would be like, and what characteristics it would have of the object or objects which when viewed up in the sky would give the same appearance that you observed.

The best I can do is to say that it would be a real bright, highly polished brass, somewhat in the shape of a bullet but tapered at both ends. As for the size I'd have no idea - it did not appear to be as large as the average airliner. More perhaps like a jet- or DC-4.

Furthermore, all of those have on accompanying noise which this did not have at all. This was absolutely silent, and it also moved steadily from end to end.
