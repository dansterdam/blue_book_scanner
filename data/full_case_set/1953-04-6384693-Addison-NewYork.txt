The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon (skyline) and an object above it, with instructions to imagine how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it.

The second sketch contains two larger panels. The panel on the left shows a person standing on a road with trees and buildings in the background. The panel on the right shows a more distant view of the landscape with a curved horizon line.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position later to similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
