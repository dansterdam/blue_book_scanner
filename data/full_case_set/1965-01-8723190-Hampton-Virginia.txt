As an OCR system, I can output the following text found in the document:

0600L. (?) vertical temperature gradient: Not taken except at
0600 28 January 1965
Surface temperature: 4.4c
4 meters (900') - 2.8c (This is a small inversion that
would disappear 1200)
6400 meters - 14.8c
9100 meters: - 18.56
18,300 meters (60,000'): - 53.6c

h. No unusual meteorological activities or conditions were reported.

There was no interception or immediate identification action taken
because the object in question disappeared from the reporting time. 

Norfolk Weather Bureau stated that a balloon had been launched
from their facilities at 1215 (15 minutes prior to the sighting). However,
position of the sighting at any time.

k. This report prepared by Captain Page G. Beale, USAF, 4400
Air Base Wing (ADC-H), Langley AFB, Virginia. The description of this UFO
sight-ing was written on 29 January 1965 after contact was made via telephone conversation
with the observer. The observer stated she was leaving town that evening for a few days. Several
attempts had been made to contract her subsequent to the initial sighting. Item can be pointed
stated repeatedly that numerous jet aircraft were observed in the immediate
vicinity of the sighting. However, due to the apparent extraordinary movement of the UFO, more
than the contrails the aircraft were leaving.  At certain high altitudes

(1) No physical evidence was reported to exist.

The observer stated she probably would not have reported this incident to the Air force if many
reports of late had not been made in the area and that she wanted to help.
