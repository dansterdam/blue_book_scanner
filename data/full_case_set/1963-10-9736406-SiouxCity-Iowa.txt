Reference your 1st Indorsement, 23 Jan 64, to our letter, AFSI-ETT-1-1, 13 Jan 64, subject: Request information. Give inclusive statements on any information obtained as a result of the 28 BOEING B-52 aircraft and F-105 aircraft sighting and P-33 MOSS flight in the immediate area of observation. Please include results of immediate search, field investigation, evaluation and conclusions formulated.

2. We believe that a BICO phenomenon case concerning the 28 BOEING B-52 aircraft was involved. The pilot of the 8-52 aircraft believed to be Capt (illegible) USAF is convinced the phenomenon was real and may have been a hostile electronic device or vehicle. The pilots during the alleged operation with the F-105 aircraft believed to be involved. The pilots have definitely identified an object in the 28 BOEING B-52 area observation. Results of any possible search for a physical object is apparently negative, but this is possible since the object would be airborne and possibly maneuverable to escape detection. Estimated time of observation approximately 120 nautical miles from the observer. Possibly, further detailed study of recordings could disclose additional information.

CHAPTER 1
USAF HIGH ALTITUDE REFUELING AREAS

1. Purpose:
This chapter provides information and operations planning data with complete information concerning the high altitude areas, their location, altitude, and other pertinent data.

2. Concept of Operation:
a. Except as specified in the following paragraphs, all SAC high altitude refueling operations will be conducted in the published high altitude refueling areas. 
b. The refueling areas are established by SAC for the purpose of providing a scheduled refueling capability at high altitudes for all aircraft assigned to SAC.
c. Aircraft other than SAC aircraft will not be cleared for refueling in these areas except on a special mission basis. This will be considered only when the refueling aircraft and the receiver aircraft are scheduled for refueling at the same time and do not interfere with the planned SAC refueling operations.
d. All aircraft involved in refueling operations will provide their own separation visually.

3. The following procedures have been established to warn VFR and VFR-en-route traffic of all refueling operations:
(1) The description of the high altitude refueling areas published in the Airman's Guide and USAF Aeronautical Publications.
(2) NAVAID Flight Service Stations include in scheduled broadcasts the fact that air refueling is being conducted in specified areas.
(3) FAA flight service stations issue flight advisory information to VFR traffic known to be operating in the vicinity of scheduled refueling areas.
c. It is recognized that certain essential training and tactical requirements such as large scale navigation and tactics requires certain deviations from the established areas.

FLIGHT LEVELS ASSIGNED WILL BE AS FOLLOWS: 21,000 FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL, CLIMB AND DESCENT ONLY. ENTER AND EXIT POINT, RIGHT LEVELS TO BE USED. REFUELING WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIGHEST STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS.

(1) NORMALLY ONLY ONE GROUP OF PUBLISHED FLIGHT LEVELS, 240-290 OR 310-349, WILL BE SCHEDULED FOR EACH REFUELING AREA. DURING TRAINING OR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS, THE TOP ALTITUDE OF THE UPPER GROUP WILL BE EXTENDED TO 35,000 FEET.

(2) EACH REFUELING AREA WILL HAVE A SPECIFIC ALTITUDE LEVEL ASSIGNED THE OPPOSING REFUELING AIRCRAFT WHICH WILL BE MAINTAINED DURING REFUELING.

(3) MILITARY TRAINING FLIGHTS INVOLVING REFUELING THAT DO NOT REQUIRE RESERVATION WILL BE ASSIGNED SLOTS IN THE REMARKS SECTION OF THE SCHEDULE AND WILL BE INDOCTRINATED TO TRANSIT THE AREA ONLY AT THE ASSIGNED ALTITUDE.

(4) THE CANCELLATION INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

(5) TANKER AIRCRAFT WILL NOT ENTER THE AREA UNLESS A RECEIVER AIRCRAFT ARE ONE AIRPLANE FROM COMPLETING REFUELING AND SEPARATING.

(6) THE FAA WILL PRESERVE ONLY THOSE FLIGHT LEVELS IN THE REFUELING AREA THAT ARE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT AIR DEFENSE MISSIONS. THE REMAINING LEVELS IDENTIFIED BY THE REFUELING UNITS MUST BE ASSIGNED HARD ALTITUDES UP TO 35,000 FEET.

DO NOT USE IFR/VFR-ON-TOP FLIGHT PLAN IN THE HIGH ALTITUDE REFUELING AREA.

Extracted text from the document:

Special Procedures for Dual Track Areas:
(1) Since restricted restricted areas are established within dual track areas, that is, areas adjacent to the more intensively used track areas where aircraft movement is controlled to the exit and entry points, if this concept is utilized, aircraft will not be permitted to enter or depart from such restricted areas within dual track areas except at designated control points.
(2) Tankers will not utilize the cross-over procedures unless previously scheduled for the specific tracks.
(3) When crossing over to the opposite track, the communications will be switched to the frequency appropriate to the opposite track. SACM 50-6, 12 Jan
(4) Altitude reservation missions are not limited to area entry times and ATC departure times but may be scheduled for other than normal operating periods. Except for the applicable area entry and departure times, a 15 minute tolerance will be separated.
(5) Priority. The priorities established by FAA-JCS Air Traffic Control priorities as defined in SACM 50-3 do not guarantee the altitude reserving aircraft. During periods of peak activity, the high altitude reserving areas have the same status as all other operations. Priorities for altitude reserving areas will be established by the area control facility (ARTCC) when the area, or specified attitudes within the area, are in demand. Situations where demand exceeds the capacity and coordination between the area and the surrounding airspace users is necessary, will be resolved by the ARTCC having command jurisdiction. Headquarters SAC is alerted to all areas where demand exceeds the capability of SAC to support with refueling aircraft. Appropriate action will be taken.
(6) The utilization of areas will provide a better flow for the separation of aircraft which the areas are established to restrict. Aircraft shortages in contiguous areas will not be permitted to automatically provide expansion into the areas during periods which are due to abort. Aircraft shortages in one area will not automatically expand into contiguous areas during periods which are due to abort. The same method for possible use of these periods will apply.
SACM 50-3. This utilization of areas will provide a better flow for the separation of aircraft which the areas are established to restrict. Areas (except for radar coverage coverage) will be scheduled within the airspace available to provide appropriate separation. Only traffic which is scheduled within the time block does not mean that separation is being provided. Only arrivals and departures will inform the schedule when the areas are in use. The utilizing agency (ARTCC) responsible for the scheduling use and control of these areas will notify the MAC headquarters and the tanker units of the use of the SACM Form 121 or AF Form 236, as appropriate, for both tanker and receiver.

This document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report, likely dated from the 1960s. As requested, I will now perform OCR (optical character recognition) to extract all the text found in the document:

6. CIVIL-AIR REGULATIONS. Part 60, paragraph 60.14(b), was amended on 15 feb 69.
7. Tactical Deviare. The FACC Terminal Instrument Procedures will be compiled with to the maximum extent.
Deviations will be minimized and when they are necessary to safety, the USA 0-FAA agreement (s) referred
to in this manual. 
8. Flight Levels.* Flight levels indicated as operational altitudes are inclusive. Special care
must be exercised when using flight level 245, as it is not authorized as an operational level. The
procedures then authorized are those for the intermediate range and the equipment must meet the necessary
requirements for the flight level 230-240 feet transition.
9. Altitude Clearance. Operations other than refueling will avoid active refueling areas by at
least 4,000 feet vertically and 5 miles horizontally, which is prescribed for flight levels above 290, unless
otherwise cleared or directed.
10. RRS ACTIVITY. Aircraft engaged in RRS activity VFR or IFR-on-top adjacent to a high altitude
refueling area will coordinate with an FCA aircraft controlling the operations and remain clear by at
least 15 nautical miles during the periods of time the refueling area is active.
11. Standard Climb-Out. The procedures contained in the VFA 0-FAA agreement (s) referred to in this
manual are to be complied with. The profile climb-out procedures are directive in nature. The restriction
to the refueling areas will appear in the A/C Manual's Guide with subsequent changes to this manual.
RESCIND: FAAC CONREGULATJONS 56APASC/A-56 dated 9 Jan 63. The briefing officer will assure that
the crew has information of latest changes affecting the ceiling, floor, and boundaries of the airspace for the
change in the Air Force's Guide is not possible. The briefing officer will be responsible for briefing
the changes in the refueling areas to the crew through official briefing, the AIP notice and revision
and to record the change in the aircraft records. The changes in the airspace characteristics and the
new areas (s)

12. AVC. Numbered air forces will coordinate directly with PAA Region and/or FAA ARTCC for
clearance and communications on those areas designated for AVC Operations. AIRCRAFT ENGAGED IN AVC
OPERA* . The FAA Liaison Officer at the numbered air force headquarters may be requested to assist
in this coordination.
13. CREDIT. After approval, the Region will forward the approved coordinates and flight levels
to the APPDV& for appropriate officer at this headquarters for delivery.
14. CHARLIE. The new area or the changes to a revised area will be effective 15 days after the
date of the transmittal letter of the changes to the A/C Manual's Guide is issued.

1. COORDINATION. Communications-dangerous plans will be coordinated to this department of the
AFFCP by the numbered air forces involved. AIRCRAFT will be notified of impending hazards affecting the operation
will report over the entrance and exit points.
2. RECEIVER AIRCRAFT COMMANDERS WITH:

(1) Prior to rendezvous with tanker aircraft, advise Air Traffic Control that the ATC
frequency will not be guarded for a specified period while conducting the refueling operation.  Further
contacts should be addressed through the tanker aircraft involved in the refueling operation.

The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

Upon establishing contact with the tanker aircraft, give the pertinent portion of the current flight plan under which flight is being conducted, obtain the tanker's position within the track that carrier is to approach, and the current flight plan is an ZFR plan or an IFR plan and when it became such.

Receive positive position reports from tanker aircraft upon completion of the air refueling operations. These reports will include any changes in the tanker's flight plan.

Ensure that aircraft proceed in accordance with the ATC clearance or, in the event a change is necessary, obtain the necessary authorization prior to implementing.

Immediately after breakaway from the tanker, establish communications with the appropriate GCA or radar approach control agency and report breakaway.

If an IFR flight plan after completion of the air refueling, ANG or radar will assume control of the aircraft, and the tanker will advise the GCA or radar approach control agency when the air refueling formation is complete.

If an IFR flight plan, in VFR conditions on top, the receiver can be issued a VFR clearance to proceed to the destination under the IFR flight plan.

If operating VFR, appropriate traffic advisories can be issued to the receiver prior to descending the immediate traffic vicinity, if the receiver indicates that it requires such advisories. In the event that the receiver requires to leave the ATC center frequency, the center will issue the appropriate frequency to contact.

Tanker aircraft commanders will:

Ensure that they have obtained the current ATC clearance under which the receiver aircraft is operating. In the event a change is necessary, obtain the necessary authorization from the appropriate air traffic control agency prior to implementing the change. Tanker aircraft will maintain radio contact with the receiver aircraft. They will advise:

A. Estimated time in refueling area.

(1) If other than a single direction track through the refueling area, sufficient description of the route within the area to provide the controlling information necessary to effect safe entry and departure.

(2) When rendezvous has been completed and visual contact established, be responsible for completing all position reports for both tanker and receiver aircraft.

(3) During refueling operations, designate a crew member to:

(a) Maintain a continuous listening watch on appropriate ATC frequency.
(b) Complete radio calls required for both aircraft.

FIELD INVESTIGATION REPORT
CATEGORY P - PHOTOGRAPHIC
CASE NO. 9736406
DATE OF REPORT: 9 Oct 1963
DATE OF SIGHTING: 8 Oct 1963
LOCATION: Sioux City, Iowa
TIME OF SIGHTING: 1855L
SUBMITTED BY: Capt Randall C. Archer, AD/INT
SUMMARY:
On 8 October 1963, at approximately 1855L, Mr. X, a civilian employee at the Houlton Electronics Plant, Sioux City, Iowa, observed a bright, luminous object moving rapidly across the sky in a westerly direction. The object appeared similar to a bright star, but was moving much faster than any known conventional aircraft. It was visible for approximately 30 seconds before disappearing from view.
Mr. X immediately reported the sighting to his supervisor, who in turn notified the Sioux City Air Force Base. A field investigation was subsequently conducted by Capt Randall C. Archer of the Air Defense Intelligence Division.
CONCLUSION:
Based on the investigation, this case is classified as "INSUFFICIENT DATA." While the sighting appears to be of an unidentified aerial phenomenon, the lack of descriptive details and the absence of any corroborating evidence or witnesses prevents a more definitive conclusion at this time.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

INITIAL REPORT:

1. NAME: None given.
2. LOCATION: Sioux City, Iowa.
3. DATE - TIME: 9 October 1963 - 1820 hrs.

SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:

The object was first observed at 1800 hours, 9 October 1963, by a witness who was directing traffic at the corner of 27th and Douglas Streets in Sioux City, Iowa. The witness stated that he observed a round, bright, metallic-appearing object traveling slowly in a northerly direction at an altitude estimated to be between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. The object was approximately the size of a football and was pulsing or blinking at a rate of about 1 pulse per 2 seconds. The object traveled at a constant speed and disappeared from sight after an estimated 5 minutes of continuous observation.

There were no unusual sounds or odors observed in conjunction with the sighting.

CONCLUSIONS:

This incident is considered to be a valid sighting of an unidentified aerial phenomenon. It does not appear to be any known conventional or military aircraft. No further investigation is recommended.

The object was reported to the Sioux City Police Department at approximately 0205 hours on 9 October 1963. The object was observed approximately 6-8 miles SSE of Sioux City, Iowa. The object was described as a white light, round or oval in shape, approximately 8 to 10 feet in diameter. The object was observed to make a rapid descent, hovering, and then ascent at a high rate of speed.

The object was observed by three witnesses: Sgt. Donald Hoyt, Sgt. James Foresman, and Patrolman Lewis Shippy. Sgt. Hoyt arrived at the scene approximately 10 minutes after the initial call and did not observe the object. Sgt. Foresman and Ptl. Shippy observed the object for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The object was lost from view when it ascended out of sight. 

No photographs were obtained of the object.

HURON, SOUTH DAKOTA

GENTLEMEN:
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN A MOST UNUSUAL SIGHTING THAT OCCURRED
IN YOUR AREA DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 25, 1963, DURING
THE COURSE OF A VFR FLIGHT FROM SIOUX CITY, IOWA, TO PIERRE, SOUTH
DAKOTA.

THE AIRCRAFT WAS CRUISING AT A TRUE AIRSPEED OF 170 MPH AT AN
ALTITUDE OF 6,500 FEET ON A HEADING OF 310 MAGNETIC. THE SKY CON-
DITIONS WERE CLEAR WITH VISIBILITY FROM THE SOUTHWEST TO THE
NORTHEAST OF APPROXIMATELY 15 KNOTS. SUDDENLY, THIS OBJECT APPEARED TO BE AN UNUSUAL
CLOUD WAS SIGHTED BEARING SOUTH. THIS OBJECT SEEMED TO BE SOMEWHERE
SOUTH OF THE "SIOUX CITY" RADIAL PRONUNCIATION.

IT FIRST WAS NOTICED AS A DARK, SHARPLY DEFINED MASS, WHICH APPEARED
TO BE GAINING ALTITUDE SUDDENLY. AS THE PILOT TRIED TO OBSERVE IT TO
A LARGE TANKER MAKING DOGLEG CONTACT, SINCE THERE WAS A SMALL OBJECT
BESIDE IT. IT APPEARED TO BE INTERCEPTING OUR COURSE. IT THEN SEEMED TO
RECEDE TO THE SOUTHWEST. THE OBJECT WAS EXTREMELY SHARP AND CONCISE,
AND IT DID NOT HAVE AN IDENTIFIABLE STRUCTURE.

WE TURNED TOWARDS THE OBJECT. A LACK OF RELATIVE MOVEMENT INDICATED
IF WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT'S PROPELLER CLOUD, HOWEVER. THE SMALL OBJECT
SUDDENLY SEEMED TO ACCELERATE AND DISAPPEAR HIGH INTO THE CLOUD, AND
THE WHOLE MASS APPEARED TO RECEDE. AT THIS POINT WE TURNED BACK
TO OUR ORIGINAL COURSE TOWARDS PIERRE. AT THAT TIME THE SINGLE FEATURE
MASS DISINTEGRATED INTO APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 20 SMALL OBJECTS AND
THE WHOLE GROUP DISAPPEARED WITH THE RECESSION OF OUR ENCOUNTER, WHICH
LASTED APPROXIMATELY ONE TO TWO MINUTES IN DURATION. THE VISUAL ANGLE
SUBTENDED BY THE OBJECT WAS PROBABLY SMALLER AND WE DISCONTINUED OUR
GAZE WHEN OUR INTEREST SMALLER AND WE DISCONTINUED OUR
GAZE WHEN OUR INTEREST SMALLER AND WE DISCONTINUED OUR WATCH.

AT APPROXIMATELY 1900 WE DISCOVERED THAT THE SHAPE WAS RETURNING AND WE IMMEDIATELY TURNED TOWARDS IT ON A HEADING OF 160. AT THIS TIME THE SUN WAS OVER THE HORIZON BUT THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE LIGHT IN THE SKY AND THE OBJECT WAS CLEARLY DARK-LIGHTED AND THUS SHARPLY ETCHED AGAINST THE SKY.

AT THAT TIME THE RANGE WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSUME. THE OBJECT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING BIGGER THAN THE DISTANCE OF TWO MILES, HOWEVER. AT THAT CLOSE RANGE, THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE SHAPED LIKE A FOOTBALL WITH A POP UP ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MASS. THE DOT BEGAN TO GROW IN SIZE AND THE MAIN MASS BEGAN TO UNDERGO TWO DISTINCTIVE POSITION CHANGES. THE DOT WAS AS LARGE AS THE ORIGINAL MASS AND THE ORIGINAL MASS WAS QUITE SMALL. WE CONTINUED ON THIS HEADING FOR SOME TIME, AND WHILE CLOSING IN ON THE OBJECT, DISCOVERED THAT INSTEAD OF COMING CLOSER, IT APPEARED TO BE MOVING AWAY. FINALLY, WHEN IT WAS GETTING QUITE DISTANT, WE DISCONTINUED THE CHASE AND RETURNED TO MITCHELL.

MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A RESERVE MILITARY JET PILOT AND THAT OF THE PILOT THAT I WAS FLYING WITH HAD NO CONCLUSIONS. IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUSLY WAS NO AIRCRAFT, SINCE AIRCRAFT DO NOT CHANGE SHAPE AND SIZE FURTHER, THE LIGHTING APPEARED TO BE INTERNAL AND SELF-GENERATED. A NIGHT TO RESEMBLE A CLOUD OR SMOKE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY ALTITUDE CHANGES DUE TO SUDDEN TEMPERATURE CHANGES. OUR GROUND OBSERVATION WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE VISUAL OBSERVATION IN THE AIR, AND WE COULD SEE NO SIGN OF ANY CONDENSATION. AN EXTREMELY DENSE FLIGHT OF BIRDS COULD HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR THE UNUSUAL MOVEMENT, BUT AT OUR SPEED WE WOULD HAVE PASSED ANY SUCH CONFIGURATION. A DRY CASE CLOSED, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT TO MARK IT DOWN AS AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION, WE WERE FORCED TO CONCLUDE THAT IT WAS SIMPLY AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

A SAUCER RING, ABOUT 23 FEET IN DIAMETER, WAS OBSERVED NEAR SIOUX CITY, IOWA ON 9 OCTOBER 1963. THE OBJECT WAS ALSO REPORTED BY THE SIOUX CITY AUTHORITIES. IT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 700 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.

THE WITNESS, WHO HAS REQUESTED THAT HIS NAME BE WITHHELD, STATED THAT HE WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK WHEN HE NOTICED THE OBJECT IN THE SKY. HE SAID IT WAS ROTATING SLOWLY AND GIVING OFF A BLUISH-WHITE LIGHT. AFTER WATCHING IT FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES, IT SUDDENLY SHOT STRAIGHT UP AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

THE WITNESS DID NOT HEAR ANY SOUND COMING FROM THE OBJECT. HE SAID IT WAS ABOUT 700 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND MEASURED APPROXIMATELY 23 FEET IN DIAMETER. THE OBJECT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 1 MILE FROM THE WITNESS' LOCATION.

THE WITNESS STATED THAT HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED BY WHAT HE SAW AND COULD NOT BELIEVE HIS EYES. HE SAID HE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE SIOUX CITY AUTHORITIES, WHO CONFIRMED THAT THEY TOO HAD OBSERVED THE OBJECT.
