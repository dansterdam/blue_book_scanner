Possible (HOT AIR BALLOON)
The police dept of Cincinnati reported that they had received so
reports of unusual sightings on 1 Jan 68 from 930 to 930 P.M. The
description is similar to these balloon reports. The object has not been
identified.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer reported two red lights in the eastern sky. The
objects changed position relative to each other. After watch
for approx 15 minutes the lower light became dimmer and disappeared. The total time to disappear was about 15 se
About 1 minute later the upper light also disappeared. The time was 022

UFO Observation, 1 January 1969

1. This office is in receipt of a report from the Cincinnati Police Department, Flying Object (UFO) report from Cincinnati, Ohio, which occurred on 1 January 1969 at approximately 9:30 p.m. EST.
2. The observer sighted two bright red lights at an angle of 15-degree elevation, directly east. One remained fixed while the other moved in various directions behind the first. It flashed on and off. The objects would disappear and reappear below the first. The movement was very slow. The lower one disappeared at 9:35 p.m. and the first object disappeared at 9:30 p.m.
The objects would start to get dimmer and then disappear about fifteen seconds later. It was no sound associated with the sighting, but seemed to flash intensively throughout the sighting, but seemed to flash and flicker.
3. Did you receive any reports of unusual objects for this date? We would appreciate your comments as possible cause for this sighting.
Please thank you for your assistance on this matter.

None brighter and appeared about the size of the brightest stars. Although it varied in intensity through 7x35 binoculars, no edges or other details could be observed. They appeared to be flashing, but synchronization. My original impression was that they were a radio tower with red lights, but, of course, I know there was more at that direction.

GARNET BAG HOT AIR BALLOONS

Hot air balloons made out of garnet bags usually appear as a red, orange, yellow or white light in the sky and may remain aloft as long as 10 to 15 minutes. If they are fairly close, they may appear as two objects, one on top of the other. The bottom object is the heat source and is quite bright and the upper dull glowing object is the garnet bag. 

Usually the heat source is on a bales wood platform. When the object is aloft it may move in an erratic manner or a straight trajectory, depending on the wind. The balloon also flashes and flickers as the wind blows the candles. When the candle-burn down the platform may catch fire and sometimes causes sparks and pieces of burning debris to fall; however, they usually burn out before they hit the earth. Shortly after the sparks stop falling the object disappears.

When they got to about the height of the trees they just seemed to get dimmer and dimmer until it disappeared. The time they took to disappear from sight was just about 10-15 seconds.

During fighting, my neighbor, Mrs. BLACKED OUT called the local police to ask if they knew what they were. The police replied that they didn't know but they were watching.
The following morning, Jan. 2, 1968, a small item about the sighting appeared in the Cincinnati Enquirer newspaper. I wanted the newspaper (Cincinnati Post and Times Star) further information but when the information was given, I decided to file a report. The night of the sighting I wrote down all the information I could think of.

APR 28-17(C1)
WE were driving home on the evening of Jan.9,1968, 2 noticed two bright lights in the sky. The lights were about a mile apart and were very still at the time. After about 3 minutes later, I had arrived home. I went to the side of my home and saw the lights were still there. I hurried inside, grabbed my 7X35 binoculars and went to my back yard where I could see them. My first observation was a slight halo and a reddish color around the outer edges. I have a good video camera to the Minox & Bolus 16mm movie camera, but it was not suitable for distant photography. We all witnessed a slow, gradual change of position. I observed and watched to note the time. Watching through binoculars did not yield any additional information. After watching for 10 minutes (the lapse of time), we observed the lights and disappeared. A minute later they reappeared. The total time required to disappear was estimated at about 15 seconds. This object like that of a lightning flash out of about 9 second interval. We confirmed this brightness to that of the brightest star. The temperature was noted to be +9°F with no moon and no wind. There were no clouds and no sound was heard. After the sighting, I wrote down all the facts in some detail as soon as I could.

Andrews-Patterson Air Force Base
Wright-Patterson AFB, OHIO

Dear Major Quintanilla:

After searching the local newspaper for three weeks and reflecting upon the situation, I feel it as my duty to report a UFO sighting. I deleted them in item at the end of the sighting and left none in item form.

DATE: Monday, January 1, 1968
TIME: 5:20 to 5:30 EST (Checked by wristwatch)
PLACE: My yard, 1448 Narrowsburg Dr., Cincinnati, Ohio
OBJECT: Two bright red lights, about the size of the largest, starry night.
BEHAVIOR: Two bright red lights, as bright as the brightest stars; remained fixed while the other moved swiftly, the motion directly below the first and moved horizontal with respect to the first and then back to below the first. Movement was very slow. The lower one disappeared at 5:30 p.m. The upper one remained fixed, but dimmer, until 5:35 p.m.; when it too disappeared. The movement was directly away until it seemed to disappear in about 15 seconds total.

VISIBILITY: Continuous; Brightness not constant, but seemed to get dimmer about every 4 seconds. No sound; viewed through Binoculars, and no other observations made.

WITNESSES: Mr. & Mrs. (redacted) and Mr. & Mrs. (redacted).

I pulled my car over to the side of the road when I first saw the object in the northwest sky. It appeared to be changing in shape and brightness as I watched it for several minutes. The object did not move in a uniform fashion but seemed to dart from one position to another and even changed direction at one point. I have observed many aircraft over the years but have never seen anything quite like this before.
