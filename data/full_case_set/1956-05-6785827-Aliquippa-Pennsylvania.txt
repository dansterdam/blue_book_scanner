The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force investigation into unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
A formation of seven objects, side-by-side in color. The size was like baseballs and a shiny object moving south at a speed of 35 MPH. FRED scrambled but negative distinctions.
11. COMMENTS
This sighting is not being investigated due to the condition of this file, which is probably incomplete. The objects were reported by birds (note - not formation, speed and altitude of the objects). It is unlikely that further investigation would reveal valuable data.
12. CONCLUSIONS
Px Unidentified
Probably Satellite
Possibly Balloon
Was Aircraft
Probably Aircraft
