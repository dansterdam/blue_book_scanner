Text from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED
Colorado Springs, Colorado  L December 1952

I. Description of Incident
An Air Force sergeant and a civilian sighted a round aluminum colored object flying east to west. It appeared to be changing shape as it proceeded out of sight to the west. The sergeant estimated the time of observation to be 10-15 minutes. The two men stated the object was slightly larger than the full moon, and traveled slightly faster than the speed of sound. Their observation indicated the object was not an aircraft, but they could not identify it.

II. Discussion of Incident
Aircraft in the area included B-29's and B-50's as well as Camp Carson observation planes. The B-29's and B-50's are said to be a possibility since they were on a south heading 7 minutes after the sighting took place. The observation plane, however, was in the area at the exact time of the observation and was discounted. The sighting lasted but a short time.

III. Conclusions
Possibly aircraft.

On Dec. 4, 1952, at approximately 11:30 p.m., my attention was called to a strange object in the sky over COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO.  A round, luminous object was observed moving slowly from west to east. It was observed for a period of approximately 45 minutes. Size: - 600 to 800 yards in diameter. Speed: 20 to 25 miles per hour. Course: 11:30 am. Weather: Clear, warm, no wind. 25 degree elevation, 330 degree azimuth. The object appeared to be oscillating or pulsating and would change in size and brilliance at irregular intervals. Without any apparent sound or trail, it finally disappeared in the east.

To determine accurately earth lines, proceed the
following steps: 1. Measure the grid distance between
two adjacent ticks on the east-west grid lines and 
divide this distance by the actual ground distance
between the same two ticks on the earth. This will give
the scale of the map in feet per inch. 2. Measure the
angle between grid north and the north-south grid
lines. This angle is the divergence of grid north.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED
DATE OF REPORT: 9-12-52
SUBJECT: COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 5-23-52 
TIME OF OBSERVATION: 8:00 AM
LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO
OBJECT OBSERVED: The observer stated that the object appeared to be a round, discus-shaped aircraft, steel grey in color, with a flat bottom and a dome-shaped top. The object was approximately 20 feet in diameter. It was observed to be moving in a horizontal direction at a high rate of speed and made no sound. The object was observed for approximately 20 seconds and then disappeared from view.
COMMENTS: This is an initial report and the case is still under investigation. Further investigation disclosed that this could have been a very unusual, extremely rare, and unique natural or man-made aerial phenomenon, and there is no evidence that it was an enemy aircraft. However, the report is considered worthy of further study and investigation.

Narrative Statements of Unidentified Flying Object
The report describes the sighting of a strange flying object on December 8, 1952 at approximately 11:00 hours. Witnesses called it a "strange flying object" and described it as being approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter. The object was observed traveling at 600 to 1000 feet in altitude, traveling at 500 to 600 miles per hour. The report mentions that the object disappeared into the distance.

It also mentions a secondary observation or projection out of the object, where a "secondary projection or projection out" was noticed. The report states that the object disappeared into the west at about same distance.

There does not appear to be any photograph or image in this document. The document seems to be a narrative statement about an unidentified flying object sighting. As an OCR system, I will now proceed to extract all the text from the document:

Narrative statement of unidentified flying object
About 1200 hours of the 4th of December 1952 I was talking to a man by the name of [REDACTED] on the installation course No. 1 on Camp Carson, Colorado. I heard a loud an object somewhere about 30 degrees from the south on the horizon.
At first it appeared to be a star, but as I watched it, the object began to move from one side to the other. At this point we decided to draw to our left and then light back on the same line. The object continued to be visible. The detail I can give you is that there was no noise - - it seemed to be moving at a tremendous rate of speed. There was no flame, no exhaust - just a round object that had an eerie glow about it.
The project officer for the 6952d intelligence squadron observed the object with me. We both felt that the object was not a known type of aircraft. The project officer phoned his information to the nearest air defense direction center.
