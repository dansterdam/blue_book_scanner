Dear ---,

Reference your unidentified observation of 9 January 66. The information you submitted to Hillendron Air Force Base on your sighting was insufficient for us to reach the conclusion as to the nature of the object. Because you complied the information on the observation so long after it occurred, the chances of verifying the incident are greatly reduced.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
