PROJECT 10973 RECORD
2. LOCATION
DAYTON, KENTUCKY
10. CONCLUSION
PREPARED AIRCRAFT WITH ADVERTISING SIGN
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observers sighted an object that had spinning lights on the bottom and seemed very low. COMMENTS: The description is similar to those normally given for electrical aerial advertisers. Dale Earn's aerial advertising plane was operating in the Cincinnati, Ohio area that night. (Dayton, Ky. is just south of Cincinnati).

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with handwritten text.

Performing OCR on the text in the image:

The girls insisted the object was 60 feet in diameter, shaped like a disc, and seemed to be vibrating or giving off a pulsating motion light they felt a tremendous pull of gravity towards the object which was hovering about 30 feet above a big field. when it started to move out over the field at a very fast rate of speed they became frightened and ran back to the car.

This document contains a photograph of a sketch or diagram that appears to be related to the sighting of an unidentified phenomenon. The sketch shows a curved line and an angle diagram, along with several annotations. However, there is no human face visible in the image.

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE
THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING ANY UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA THAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED. PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS. THE INFORMATION YOU GIVE WILL BE USED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES, AND MAY ASSIST IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF ANY PHENOMENA WHICH HAVE BEEN OBSERVED. IN SOME CASES, ADDITIONAL SKETCHES OR PHOTOGRAPHS ARE NEEDED FOR EVALUATION. THEREFORE, YOUR COOPERATION IN PROVIDING INFORMATION AND, IF POSSIBLE, SKETCHES OR PHOTOGRAPHS IS GREATLY APPRECIATED.

- page 3 -

The image contains two illustrations related to a UFO phenomenon. The larger illustration is a compass-like diagram with various directional markings, indicating the direction of the observed phenomenon. The smaller illustrations depict a landscape with a person standing on a road, suggesting the perspective of the observer.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

THE OBJECT APPEARED AS A SINGLE BRIGHT ORBLIND THAT REFLECTED LIGHT FROM THE SUN OR MOON. IT SEEMED TO MOVE SILENTLY AND WOULD SOMETIMES DISAPPEAR BEHIND CLOUDS ONLY TO REAPPEAR LATER. BASED ON ITS MOVEMENT AND APPEARANCE, IT SEEMED LIKE SOME SORT OF AIRCRAFT OR AERIAL VEHICLE RATHER THAN A CELESTIAL BODY LIKE A STAR. I COULD NOT MAKE OUT ANY DISTINCT FEATURES OR DETAILS ON THE OBJECT ITSELF.

"27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

At this point the sighted case was received at the Dayton Air Force Base and not even the report forms could accurately reflect the details involved. There was apparently no real investigation - just routine calling up of the witness and obvious effort to dispel the sighting as anything unusual. The right of the witness was obviously to cover up something and the report was written that way. The details were of considerable interest and yet were not properly reported."

DESCRIPTION: The object had spinning lights around the bottom and seemed to be very low. It appeared disc shaped and may have had windows around it. 
Mrs.    , said were what is could have been that they saw, as I said that I thought the description was similar to others I had received of Dale Barnes' aerial advertising plane. I said that I knew that Mr Barnes' plane was operating around Cincinnati, Ohio on that weekend and asked her how close Dayton, Kentucky was to Cincinnati. Mrs.    replied that Dayton was just south of Cincinnati across the river.
DAYTON KENTUCKY IS IMMEDIATELY ACROSS THE RIVER FROM CINCINNATI, OHIO.

The image contains two photographs. The larger one appears to be a compass rose or navigation diagram, with labeled cardinal directions. The smaller image on the bottom left shows a landscape view with a person in the foreground.

AFR 60-17(C1)

Now imagine you are at the center of the compass rose. Place an X on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when first seen. Place a 4-on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when last seen.

In the sketch below, place an X at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a 4 at the position of the phenomenon when last seen. Connect the X and 4 with a line to indicate the path of the phenomenon. Refer to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
