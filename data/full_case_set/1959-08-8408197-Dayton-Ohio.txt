The image does not contain any photographs or images, it only shows text that appears to be handwritten on a page. I will now proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text found in the image:

of the description seem to be at least, so that some understanding may be obtained as to the nature of the objects in question. However, due to the complexity of the reports and the sketchy nature of some of the information given, it is difficult to arrive at any definite conclusions. There were no witnesses to the landings or takeoffs of the objects, and no tangible evidence was recovered. All the information is based on visual sightings only. 
The cases described here do not lend themselves to any easy explanation, and more information would be needed to attempt a solution. It is hoped that more definite data will be obtained in the future to shed light on these reports.

The image provided appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a typed text describing an incident, but there is no photograph present on this page.

The text in the document is as follows:

"To be truthful the first report I recorded was not recorded before they had made their presence known to the observer. At the scene of this activity a triangularly lighted object was observed hovering at tree top level for approximately 2320 to 2330 hours. This object was approximately 30 to 50 feet in diameter and at an altitude of approximately 150 to 200 feet. The object was observed to be illuminated with a bright white light which seemed to be emitting from the whole body of the object. No structural details could be distinguished. As the observer was observing the object it was noted that it was slowly moving in a northerly direction. After several minutes of observation the object accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight in a northerly direction."

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the instruction to "Imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it."

The second sketch contains two illustrations. The larger one shows a person standing on a road with buildings and landscape in the background. The smaller one shows a person standing on a hilltop with mountains in the background.
