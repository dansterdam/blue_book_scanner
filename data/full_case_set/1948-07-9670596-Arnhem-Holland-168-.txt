Incident #168 -- The Hague -- 20 July 1948

This information herein is too limited even for
guesswork. It is extremely difficult to take at face value the
report of an aircraft with two decks using no wings, travelling,
with supersonic speed, even if "seen four times through clouds"
by the chief of the fleet of KLM and his daughter. It seems
much more probable that the observers had a subjective impression
of ordinary aircraft or a fireball. Even though those two items
are at opposite ends of the scale, there is nothing in the evi-
dence to favor one or the other.

In passing, it is interesting to note that this inci-
dent occurred just four days before the famous "Chiles-Whitted
ship". Maybe our 'visitors' from Mars were cruising around!

Incident No. 168 -- 20 July 1948, 1730 hours, Arnhem, The
Hague.
Observer saw an object intermittently through clouds four times.
The object had two decks and no wings, was said to be very high, with
speed comparable to V-2.

A/C Opinion: Insufficient information. It may be well to point
out that the V-2 is not visible in flight, therefore, it follows that
this object would not have been visible as described if traveling at
that speed.

20 JULY 44

With all indicating causes eliminated, there remains thirty-four which contain no evidence which warrants special explanation. This statement is true only under the assumption that the evidence is regarded as reliable and convincing. When evaluated and considered, and when due taken into consideration, all of these thirty-four 
is explained rationally, as pointed out by letter of Commanding General of Air Material Command Headquarters, Wright Field. (See appendix ".")

A consideration (Appendix I for survey 
& incidents considered)

When time and sufficient psychological explanation for the major
unidentified Flying Objects to provide plausible explanations for the reports not otherwise explainable. These errors in identity, these hasty results shortly from inability to estimate speed, distance, altitude.

All of the remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail in appendix "E". Since no incidents show path in two directions at some object, or moment of path curvature, they are judged as to what is going on by the attitude body or spiritual entity, probably the former, not yet been considered crucial or important as no reliability.
