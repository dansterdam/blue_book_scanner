There is a photograph present in this image, which appears to be an article from a newspaper called the "Wakefield Daily Item" dated September 10, 1964. The article is titled "Flying 'Object' Sighted In Area" and discusses a reported sighting of a mysterious object in the sky.

Text from the document:

Volpe Flying High?
Flying "Object" Sighted In Area
While it must be accepted as fact, from the bridge of The Ship That In Once An Airborne Tooting Doodle 1 In Livingston, England, There has been a considerable excitement through this region known as Lynnfield, over the sighting of what they describe to be an unidentified flying object. The object was viewed by several, including professional policeman, those who John Zappala and two passers-by, who witnessed what they believe to be the mysterious object soar through the skies of this particular section of New England.
The object, reportedly, was first sighted by the above named participants; then later, according to statements made to Daily Item reporters, it was sighted by the residents of many homes within the area, where it was seen to be zig-zagging at a speed of some 3o to 4o miles an hour, and at an estimated height of 3oo to 5oo feet.
The object, according to witnesses, appeared to be circular in shape and about the size of a "crashed automobile", Mrs. Jean Walsh of 4 Jefferson St. (65) told a Daily Item reporter. She was the first to spot it from her home, she said, and her husband, Willitm E. Walsh, Sr., Confined to his home with a broken leg, also saw the strange aerial object traversing the sky. They describe it as being "faster than any plane that they had ever seen." The circular object was then seen by several others in the area, who all seemed puzzled by its appearance and actions.
Glenn Collins of 33 Lake St. told the Daily Item that he and several others observed a "flying saucer" passing over the junior high school in Lynnfield, just before 7 p.m. last Wednesday night. He said that the object was traveling at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight rather quickly.
Other reports were made from surrounding and more residents in Lynnfield and surrounding towns, all with the same description of the object, stating that it was a noiseless, unidentified flying object, and not an airplane.

Attention: Major Maston M. Jacks

Dear Major Jacks:

Thank you for your letter of 14 October 1964 in response to one of several that I wrote to the Director of Project Blue Book concerning the UFO sightings on 9 September 1964 in the Boston, Massachusetts, area. These matters are concerning the experiences of a friend of mine, and his friend was a searchlight or spotlight, and I am supplying the following information.

One of my initial questions to Mr. Washer was whether a searchlight or close-by light was what he might have witnessed over Boston and such a light could have performed the maneuvers he described. Only the "bottom" of the object was viewed, and it was solid, flat, and flying below the cloud base. Only the "bottom" of the object was viewed, and it was solid, flat, and flying below the cloud base.

The answer to the search light consideration was negative, as the object in question was over the Charles River towards Boston and the apparent and disappearance of the object was too rapid to have been caused by a searchlight, and it was a more positive sighting than could be caused by a searchlight. There was also a negative reaction to the suggestion that it could have been an advertising plane, as the object made a much sharper turn than any aircraft could perform. I merely pass on these details as they concern the experience of this friend of mine, and I am seeking clarification and trying to resolve his experience, which was startling and resulted in some personal reflection on the event.

For some reason, there has been a delay in UFO sightings in this area, and the Air Force has been rather inactive in following up on these sightings. As soon as I have any further information, I will be in touch with you. If there is anything further I can do to assist you in this matter, please let me know.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

which was on a landing approach to Hanscom AFB. It was dark gray or other appendagaes were observed, No noise, No exhaust trail. It hovered momentarily and then departed at high speed. There was no physical contact and just before the sound barrier was broken, a low hollow sound was heard for a few seconds. It has been estimated that this object was about one quarter mile in diameter.

In accordance with AFR 200-2, dated 20 July 1962 and amended on 30 July 1963, would you please send me the USAF fact sheet on the well-publicized New Mexico UFO sighting by Captain Joseph C. Meier on 23 May 1964. Your office making available to the public "will be appreciated" concerning information on this case.

For official use only, but would those reports cleared by your office to be made available to the public and what procedures would I have to go through. We would have to put on a distribution list for future releases or would I have to ask for specific cases and am dependent upon UFO information through UFO organizations, newspapers, magazines, professional societies and others.

The Director of the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force would be officially notified and the investigations and conclusions concerning UFO's would be made available as much information as possible to carry on and continue to be public as these objects.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Yours sincerely,
Raymond E. Fowler

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

14 October 1964

Dear Mr. Fowler:

We are in receipt of your report of unidentified flying object sightings on 9 September 1964 in the Boston, Massachusetts area. 
These sightings, as seen with your conclusions on sightings, agree in some detail with your conclusions on 2 August 1964 Boston, Massachusetts sightings. As in the previous case, the information does serve as confirmation of the visual contacts displayed by aircraft with unidentifying characteristics.

The sightings of witnesses one and two cannot be evaluated as the same time. This sighting presents some characteristics of a reflection of ground lights, and does not permit establishment of a cloud or haze layer and the presence of a second object.

The Air Force wishes to thank you for your interest in aerial phenomena.

Wenhum, Massachusetts
Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

We are in receipt of your report of unidentified flying objects sightings on 9 Sep 64 in the Boston, Massachusetts, North Shore area. We have evaluated your conclusions on sightings there with your permission, since these reports are of identified objects and not unidentified.

The sightings or witnesses are over an area of two square miles and for a considerable time. This sighting presents some characteristics of a reflection search/other ground light. Verification of weather data to establish a cloud or haze layer and the presence of personal searchlight/spotlight in the area is also highly suggestive of this explanation. The second object was varying to different shape with fuzzy edges, no noise, dull grey color diffused with yellowish tint. This motion is also highly suggestive of this explanation.

Did James Washer have the feeling that the second object was trying to interact or catch the advertising plane? The Air Force wishes to thank you for your interest in aerial phenomena.

The text in the document is as follows:

22 October 1964

Dear Mr. 

We are in receipt of your report of unidentified flying object sightings on 9 September 1964 in the Boston, Massachusetts, North Shore area. This report has been considered with the conclusions as follows:

Apparent there were two or more objects observed and not identifiable as known aircraft. The sightings could not be evaluated as natural phenomena. 

The sightings of witnesses are and two cannot be evaluated as the available data provides insufficient detail of the observation to determine the nature of the object. A complete evaluation would include the weather conditions at the time of sighting, the nature and details of the terrain, the location of the observers, and the direction and movement of the object in relation to ground and celestial references. The object is in accord with this evaluation. The object was elliptical in shape with a well-defined outline. Color was reportedly silver/grey and brightly lit. No exhaust or vapor trail was observed.

By your continued investigation this possibility could be finding that the second object was just a star or planet and the first object was a more conventional aircraft such as someone with a spotlight perhaps attempting to locate the UFO.

The Air Force wishes to thank you for your interest in aerial phenomena.

Sincerely,

MASON H. JACKS

HARVARD SQUARE BRIDGE - 9:30 PM
(Data Sheet to NICAP)

James and his wife were driving across the Harvard Square Bridge in Cambridge, Massachusetts, when they observed an extremely bright object coming down toward the bridge. The object appeared to be controlled, and as it descended, it illuminated the area so brightly that it was almost like daylight. The object passed over the bridge and then suddenly shot up at a very high speed, disappearing from sight.

Other motorists in the area also observed the object, and it was reported to the Air Force. An investigation was immediately initiated. The results so far are as follows:

SIGHTING ACCOUNTS (continued)

When the object sped up and accelerated vertically out-of-sight, the witnesses noticed something peculiar. The object seemed to have several lights on its surface which were either blinking or flashing rapidly. The object moved in a straight line and the witnesses could hear no sound as it moved. It was observed through binoculars and the witnesses noticed that it changed color from white to orange or red during its flight. The object moved at a high rate of speed and was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes.

WITNESS # 2

NEAR FENWAY PARK - 8:30+

Path witnesses saw a low-flying object near Fenway Park (see Map) which was described as flat with bright lights on it. It accelerated rapidly and climbed vertically out of sight. (The witnesses requested anonymity and confidentiality for fear of ridicule and job loss).

TV-RADIO STATION WBZ - 8:30-8:55+ PM
(On-the-scene camera crew through WJAR member reporter Stuart, WBZ)
WJAR member station staff witnessed the object together with WBZS crew.

The report was of the witnesses' observations when the low-flying light was observed. The object was observed to rise rapidly and silently from one point and then moved off to another point, almost hovering there and then moved off again to a third point, at which time it appeared to pick up speed and moved out of sight at a very high rate of speed. No sound was heard during the observation. The object was described as round in shape and appeared to have a reddish glow around it.

The witness, Mr. Herman Sokoloff, of Newton, Mass., reported that on Sept. 9, 1964, at approximately 8:45 PM EDT, he observed an unidentified flying object over Boston, Massachusetts.

He states that the UFO was first noticed while he was driving his automobile on the Massachusetts Turnpike near the Allston-Brighton line. He said he watched the object for approximately 4 minutes as it hovered and maneuvered in the sky. 

The object was described as rectangular in shape, approximately 50-75 feet long and 15-20 feet high. It had no visible means of propulsion and made no sound. The color was reported to be a dull silver.

Mr. Sokoloff said the object was observed to make several distinct maneuvers such as hovering, accelerating rapidly, and making sudden turns. At one point, the object appeared to "flip over" rapidly and then resume its original position and heading.

After several minutes, the UFO accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view to the northeast.

Mr. Sokoloff stated that he had a clear and unobstructed view of the object throughout the sighting. He also said that he pulled his automobile over to the side of the road in order to observe the object more closely.

The report was received at the Boston office of the Federal Aviation Agency on September 10, 1964. A field investigation was made by an FAA investigator that same day.
