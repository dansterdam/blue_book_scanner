11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a red/green, and blue colored object travel across the sky opposite the horizon. The object was noted moving into the west and disappeared from view into three distinct sections. The first or upper section was red, while the lower half was blue and green.
Due to the late date of the report, it is being carried as insufficient data since it would be extremely difficult to determine the nature of the activity.

The image does not appear to contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram related to a UFO sighting report. The diagram shows a compass-like illustration with various angles and directional markers, along with some instructions for the person filling out the report.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The image appears to be a form from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects. The form contains questions related to the sighting of a UFO or similar object, including the date, location, and whether anyone else witnessed the event. However, there is no photograph present in this particular page.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before. If so give date or dates and location.
No

31. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? (Circle One)
Yes No
31.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object too? (Circle One)

maiden, n.c. 
maiden, n.c.

32. Please give the following information about yourself:
NAME
ADDRESS Street MAIDEN city STATE n.c. Zone  State
TELEPHONE NUMBER
AGE 15 SEX Male
Indicate any additional information about yourself, which might be pertinent.
I was observed and considered myself an attentive attomey. I have seen many notions and indicia, and I have wondered a great deal about the nature of human and extraterrestrial objects.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? May 22, 1966 Sheriff of Catawba County, North Carolina.

The image does not contain any photograph or visual element. It appears to be a scanned page from a document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, a historical program for the investigation of UFOs by the United States Air Force.

The text on the page is a handwritten response to a questionnaire, describing the witness's observations of an unidentified object. The text provides details about the object's appearance, behavior, and the witness's interactions with it.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 10 December 1964
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: The object appeared to be divided into three sections. The top section appeared to be red, and was the brightest part of the object. The lower half was divided into two portions of blue and green. The object radiated light all over the body, and was very bright.
The moon was in the sky, but it was in a lower position of the sky. We were in an open field when we saw the object. We only watched the manifestation of the object.
Estimated the speed and the distance away from the object. An another question (26) of could not think of an object or aircraft when placed in the sky would look like the object or seen.
