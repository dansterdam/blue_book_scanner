UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Minot, North Dakota
Date: 25 July 60 
Time (Z): 0657
Weather: Wind NW 5 mph
Description: Round, size of car at arms length, flickered from white to red to blue to write to red.
Direction of Motion: circled
Satellites: (ARIN-APD, Phone 69219) Duration excessive, and flight rate is not consistent with a satellite.
Astronomical Phenomena: (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.) from astro (vega)
Radar Analysis: None
Natural Phenomena: (Ball Lightning, etc.) None
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Remained in the same general area for 1 1/2 hrs
Evaluation of Source Reliability: less reliable
Analysis and Conclusions: Apparently a large number of people saw the object, but only the impression of one individual was reported. It is believed that the object could remain unidentified for three hours and disappear as daylight appeared. The object's movements seemed to be erratic and its color changes appeared inexplicable. Balloon, meteor, planet, and other common explanations do not seem to fit the reported phenomena and it is probable that the object was something not recognized.
