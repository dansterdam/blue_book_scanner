track; however, sighting is
characteristic of orbital obser-
vation. 1958 Gamma was visible

Sputnik III

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 16 AP
-- Harvard University said last
night that its radar pickedup
Sputnik III and three rocket
boosters in the second stage of
launching. The identification was
made by Dr. Fred L. Whipple,
director of the university's Air
Force-Smithsonian meteor proj-
ct. Whipple is also chairman of
the Smithsonian satellite track-
ing program. "Radar echoes re
ceived this morning,” Whipple
said, "strongly indicate the
Sputnik III is in four earth satel
lite orbits simultaneously." Seven
other members of the Air
Force-Smithsonian project staff
joined Whipple in the announcement.
