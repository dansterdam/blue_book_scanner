The text in the document states that several objects were observed as they accelerated and decelerated, with a "white-ish glow" or "haze" around them. The objects were accelerating and decelerating, and were seen for 2-3 minutes. The observer considered the observations to be reliable, but the conclusion was that there was insufficient data to determine what the objects were.
