TO: Chiefj Air Technical Intelligence Division

1. Reference our AF Form 28 Augusta 1950, same subject as above.
Attached large scale maps of the area in question were obtained and the correct spot rather than that shown on the map was located by Bill Magellan and myself. The object was found to have crashed into the water about 10 fathoms of water. A search for the object would entail diving operations at this depth.
2. It is suggested that all documents pertaining to this case be filed in the event the future status of Project Blue Book proves to be a mystery.
3. All documents referring to this one are returned herewith.

The image provided appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document does not contain any photographs, but there is text that discusses the details of a reported UFO sighting.

Using the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

REPORT
INITIAL REPORT OF UFO
LOGS AND DESCRIPTION:
In the period 10 October 1950, a Project Blue Book report indicated an unidentified object was sighted and reportedly made contact with the ground near Spearfish, South Dakota. It was determined that the object had fallen into the sea.
1. This information was forwarded to ATIC-232 for the purpose of determining the possibility of an attempt to recover or otherwise locate the object.
2. A photographic chart of the area was obtained to determine the coordinates of the investigation. However, it was found that the data reported by the observer did not fully with the theory that the object had fallen into the sea.
3. Subject matter will not be suitable for inclusion in the Daily Staff Digest.
ACTION RECOMMENDED:
7. Apparent signature and dispatch of attached PR.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, which consists of text only.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

The passage describes an incident involving a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO). It mentions that the object was observed by several witnesses, who provided detailed descriptions of its appearance and movements. The passage also notes that the object was tracked on radar. However, the exact identity and origin of the object remain unclear based on the information provided.

- page 28 -

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing only text.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

The object was first observed by the witness at approximately 8:50 p.m. Central Standard Time on November 3, 1950 in the vicinity of Fort Pierce, Florida.

The witness was driving west on State Road 606, approximately 4 miles from Fort Pierce, when he observed the object. He stated that at first he thought it was an aircraft, but as it came closer he realized it was not a conventional airplane.

The object was described as being disc-shaped, silvery-white in color, and approximately 50 feet in diameter. It was traveling in a northerly direction at an estimated speed of 500-600 miles per hour and at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. 

The object was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes before it disappeared from sight. No sound was heard during the sighting.

The witness was a 42-year-old male, had 20/20 vision, and reported no physical effects from the sighting. He appeared to be a reliable and credible witness.

This report was forwarded to the Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, the official U.S. government program for investigating unidentified flying object (UFO) reports.

The image contains a hand-drawn diagram or sketch, but no photograph. The diagram appears to be related to an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Project Blue Book.

SOURCE: 
Well, now, the G.I. didn't see the splash. They did see the light. They thought it was just another aircraft. Let's of these aircraft would come over and turn on their lights to say "hello". We'd shine ours back to them.
CAPT RUPPELT: And they came up where you were playing pinochle and told you about it. It took them about three minutes to get up there?
SOURCE:
A little longer than that. About five or ten minutes.
CAPT RUPPELT: O.K., then that's about it.
