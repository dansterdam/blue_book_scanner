2. In contact with a Capt. Mignano and a WFASF Reserve, Miame 5392, the following general summary was given. 

- These were a conditionally invisible, but passively luminous, round object.
- Object appeared to be about 51'4" in diameter, and emitted a light of intensity up to 15,000 candle-power. 
- Object was intelligibly and rapidly maneuverable.

Memorandum: The above is a portion of the IT UFO incident file, furnished from the restricted project BLUE Book records.

DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO. SUBJECT Radar UFO Report
TO AFCIN-DESA FROM AFCIN-DESA DATE 1 Aug 57 COMMENT NO. 1
1. In accordance with established ATIC policies for the study and appraisal of UFO radar sightings, request your review and analysis of the incident in attached teletype reports, by comment hereon.
2. To possibly assist you in this matter, the following pertinent items are made a matter of note:
a. Video was turned off for one complete sweep - but object continued.
b. Area in which object disappeared (195 miles, 66 degrees from radar site in the Burro Canyon Area, Utah). This area has a VHF and a GCA station. The electronics facility did not show the object.
c. The line-plot from the radar station to the first "hump" (30 degrees) and the point of disappearance (66 degrees) generally parallels a traffic array. (This is offered for whatever it may be worth in your analysis).
d. A check with weather units in the area indicate that there was a conditionally unstable temperature gradient in the area, with broken cumulus activity up to 12,000 feet.

SUBJECT: Radar UFO Report
TO: AFCIN-4B31
ATTN: Capt. Gregory
FROM: AFCIN-4B31
DATE: 15 AUG 57

1. Check of personnel familiar with the AN/FPS-3A radar indicates that it is possible to obtain various radar videos and targets due to display.

2. The extreme speed of the alleged target eliminates the possibility that it is a normal aircraft.

3. Normally, the reflection from the target aircraft is observed, although weaker than the LRP returns.

4. This appears to be another case of a radar sighting for which there is no satisfactory explanation, due to lack of sufficient data.
