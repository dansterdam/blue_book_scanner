At approximately 7:11 PM, the observer sighted a bright, circular object in the sky to the northwest. The object appeared to be approximately 20-30 degrees above the horizon and was stationary. 

The object was an estimated 3-5 degrees in apparent diameter and appeared to emit a bright, white light. The light was intense, but not dazzling, and illuminated the surrounding hazy area.
