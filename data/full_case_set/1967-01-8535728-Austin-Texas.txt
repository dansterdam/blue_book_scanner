Observer watched a white colored object that appeared to blink like a star. The object traveled toward the southeast part of the sky. After the object disappeared it appeared to slow down and then disappear. All of a sudden the white object reappeared. The description is consistent with that of a satellite. The satellite in question is Echo II, which was in view in the area at that time over 1004."

Place a "Q" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place an "X" on the compass where you last saw the object.

(1) At approximately 0315, AST AND 4:38 PM EST, OUR OBJECT.

(2) The object was described as an extremely bright light, estimated as approximately 35 feet in diameter, and which appeared to be at an altitude of 500 to 1,000 feet. The object hovered very slowly at this altitude for approximately 45 seconds, the light being pulsating or blinking.

(3) the object then moved in a northeasterly direction at a high rate of speed, being lost to sight in approximately 15 minutes.

(4) During this time, a light switch in the house was flipped off and on, as if a light was turned off and then on. 

(5) The witness stated he had never seen anything like this before, and that it appeared to be as bright and large as a house on fire.

(6) The object was visible for approximately 15 minutes, giving a clear and steady view.

(7) The object was saucer-shaped for approximately 15 minutes, giving a little time to observe it.
