The provided image contains a diagram and a compass rose illustration, but no photographic images. The diagram appears to be an illustration used in a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass to show the direction from which you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were travelling.

Air Force Academy 
Washington 25, D. C.
Dear Sirs,
What I am about to tell you is very, very important. First I wrote to the National Aeronautics and Administration in Houston Texas. They said I could write to Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Then they referred my letter to the SAO (Smithsonian) Observatory Cambridge Mass. Finally they said I could write to you, so here I am. On July 1, 1963 the altitude (used a theodolite) was 29 degrees and the azimuth was 240 degrees. It was round to the naked eye and was moving very slowly. I had an aurora - The time was 10:00 to 11:00 then it was going down to the horizon slowly. It was also bright. Could you tell me what this is?
Sincerely,
SMC
