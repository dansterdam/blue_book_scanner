I know what I seen with my own eyes, Retired school teacher. I have. Taught school at Middleport for over 20 years and am well known in the community. On April 7, 1967 at approximately 8:40 P.M. my wife and I were driving home from a church meeting. It was a clear night with no clouds in the sky. We were traveling south on Route 18 about 3 miles west of Middleport, N.Y. when I noticed a bright light in the eastern sky. I pointed it out to my wife. We both watched it for about 5 minutes. It appeared to be hovering in the air and changing colors from bright white to orange to red. After hovering for about 5 minutes it suddenly took off at a high rate of speed and disappeared over the horizon in a matter of seconds. I have never seen anything like it before. It was quite a sight. I would be willing to take a lie detector test or send a committee to come to Middleport to check out the details of my story. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY 

FEB 8 1967

Dear Mr. _______,

President Johnson has asked that I reply to your recent letter regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The Air Force is responsible for investigating reported sightings of UFOs to determine if they pose a threat to the United States. After investigating some 12,000 sightings in the past 20 years, NO EVIDENCE HAS EVER BEEN REVEALED THAT UFOs ARE A THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. However, we will continue to investigate any information on UFOs which I hope you will find interesting and informative.

I am informed that we do not have a record of the sighting of August 1967 which you mention. Therefore, it is requested you complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the envelope provided so that an analysis of your observation can be made. It will not be necessary for you to travel to Washington to make this report.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

Sincerely,

B. M. ETTENSON
Colonel, USAF

Transcription of the text:

"Slid out the bear cub, just went the streets a-jumping up and down the skyl I threatened to punch the trashman who lives with a canning army. Shut that is bad for it was a recluse and a grading enemy. 

About 4:45 P.M. the skies opened up, many people, including me, received a very bright light, severe enough to blind me for about 5 seconds. Same phenomenon occurred yesterday in the same area. From all accounts, it seems to me from the same object that appeared yesterday. 

Some said that it might have been a missile test. I must now ask the president (if he will listen) the rest of my life. I want to come to grabs with this matter which as I said before is intriguing to our country. So Mr President, if you would please for me to be certain to Washington D.C.? Sooner would not be too early for when the comet gets in, we want me to appear before the public should my story be acceptional with what I say. Sincerely, The shape, size etc."

1. The main illustration is a compass rose diagram, which appears to be an instructions guide on how to indicate the direction of an observed phenomenon using a compass. The diagram shows the 16 cardinal and intercardinal directions labeled.

2. The bottom portion of the image contains two sketches depicting a person's field of view when observing a phenomenon. The sketch on the left shows a wide panoramic view, while the sketch on the right shows a more focused, close-up view.

Text Extracted from the Document:

DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "-" AT THE POINT OF THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "-" AT THE
MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE IMMEDIATE MOVEMENT
OR PATH OF THE PHENOMENON. ANY ABRUPT CHANGE IN DIRECTION SHOULD BE SO INDICATED. AS AN EXAMPLE, HOW TO COMPLETE
