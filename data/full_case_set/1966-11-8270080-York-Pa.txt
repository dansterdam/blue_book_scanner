To whom it may concern,

I would like to report an Unidentified Flying Object. Before I begin though, I must tell you that I have sent an exact copy to A.P.R.O.

On November 11, 1966, I was on my way home. As I stood outside the door I saw something in the sky.

It looked like a very shiny metal cone with short wings. 

As I watched, it disappeared behind a row of houses on our street. By the time I had run out back it was gone.

The next day, between 4:15 and 4:30 I again saw the thing almost in the same position as before. This time I did a bit of research.

When I saw the thing I was standing approximately 90 feet from a telephone pole which was feet high from ground level. Directly above the pole was the thing. It moved in a easterly direction and seemed to be about a mile away in the sky. To me it seemed to be about an inch long.

Would you please give me some information concerning the object.

Yours truly,

[Signature]
