The text:

The same morning June 2nd, I discussed this further with Chief Radarman Warren Nielson. Ret., who lives on Washington Island but he reached Radar in the past during the school years. He explained some of this phenomena. (The busy from the Escanaba area), as the bending of light rays over the water as a possibility.

During the day we also heard a report of a huge barn fire in the Sturgeon Bay area which alite is some distance to the south over water. Whether this accounted for the fire-like sighting on water level I have no idea.

On Friday June 25, 1965 Mr. Nielson heard over the news on radio from Marinette, Wisconsin that an additional similar sighting had been reported at 2230 Thursday June 24 in the area of Escanaba, Michigan. That same evening, June 25, I called the Escanaba Coast Guard Station inquiring of Reg/ic Silver about later sighting on Thursday 24, (June 24). He had not heard about this and suggest I call Truax Field and report my sighting, which I did immediately. Your Lt. Patterson requested that I file this report which I am submitting herewith.

Following this call, I had a chance meeting in the village of Washington Island with the Specialist 1/c and his Chief from the Plum Island Coast Guard with whom I had talked on Thursday 4PM at the time of the initial sighting. Both he and the Chief, my wife and I discussed this further. The Chief said they had searched the area in small craft during the daylight hours of the day I made my report, Thursday June 24, to no avail. All was reported in the log book on Plum Island, according to the Chief. I told them of my conversation to Texas Field.

We have made an attempt to sketch the objects as seen, plus the slides enclosed for your evaluation. We have also enclosed maps of Washington Island and of the Whole Door County area, for your information.

In closing I would like to give my interpretation of what this could have been.
This would appear to be a spacecraft, approximately 100 ft. long x 20 ft. in diameter with flat ends. From the apparent individual actions of the lesser objects it would seem to be some kind of homing (?) and/or maneuvering device launched from above.
If we can be of further service please contact us.

My wife's name is REDACTED. Age 44.
We reside at REDACTED Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53209.
We are both in good health, both have good vision, and for the purpose of the sightings our naked eyes served very well.
Yours very truly,

SYNOPSIS: Information reported concerning unidentified flying object sighting in the vicinity of Washington Island, Wisconsin.
DETAILS:
1. On 4 JUNE 1965, at approximately 2300 hours, a USAF patrol car on routine patrol observed an unidentified flying object hovering over the water approximately 1 mile off the shoreline of Washington Island, Wisconsin. The object was first observed to the east of the patrol car and was approximately 1/2 mile out over the water. It remained stationary for a period of approximately 1 minute and then rapidly accelerated in a westerly direction and disappeared from sight in approximately 3 seconds. The object was described as round or oval in shape and emitting a bright white light. No sound was heard emanating from the object.
2. The patrol car commander immediately notified the Commanding Officer, 21st Air Division, USAF, who in turn notified higher headquarters. An immediate investigation was conducted by the 21st Air Division. No further information has been received from the reporting agent concerning this sighting.
3. This case is being forwarded to Project Blue Book for analysis and evaluation.

FLY-IN FISH BOIL in mid-July
The SKIN DIVER will find fascinating underwater rock formations. There are numerous sunken vessels to be found in the Death's Door passage and other locations.
The season begins with the perch run about mid-April, just as the ice leaves the harbors. Northern Pike, Rock Bass and Small Mouth Bass thrill the fisherman from spring through autumn in the natural spawning grounds of this area.
The harbors and forests are great places to explore. For the nature lover, the woods abound with wild flowers, a variety of song birds, animals and wild game. An added dividend is finding the rare Calypso Orchid - LOOK but don't TOUCH these delicate blooms.
From childhood, the natives are taught dances and take pride in the Scandinavian Festival in August. Islanders are noted for their delicious cooking as exemplified in Scandinavian - homeland foods.
Should you miss the annual festival, the Scandinavian Dances are offered for your entertainment on Thursday evenings at 8:30.
Gorgeous foliage, migrating birds and cool crisp nights make September and October ideal vacation months for those seeking perfect rest.
Potato Harvest Season presents its own rewards as everyone joins in the picking.
A fresh, peaceful over Washington Island is a sight you will long remember.
On the Island, you will experience a warmth of friendliness, so rare in the hustle and bustle of city life. Symbolic of Scandinavian hospitality is the huge coffee pot near the ferry dock, hand-painted with the Norwegian inscription "COFFEE IS THE BEST OF ALL EARTHLY DRINKS".
For the airborne, fly to the Washington Island airport - it's lightest Telephone.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
23 Oct 65
Mr. - noticed a shadow on the negative.

Mr. - had called the Coast Guard. Called Racnabe and filed a report to Madison. He understood that there was another report in the area. He was out on Washington Island and there was no breeze. Mr. - said this thing appeared North-Northwest about 10,000 ft. from an unscientific approach. It was traveling Northwest-after 10 seconds it started down. The whole thing lasted in the area of 15 to 30 minutes including the phone call to the Coast Guard. He was facing West. The thing came out of a right angle. Approached him 1/2 to 1 mile or 1 1/2 mile - came at him about 5 to 8 seconds. There was a loud roar. Sounded as if he was near 20 to 60 feet from a jet motor. At the point it was still hovering he called the Coast Guard. Triangular flare - 2 degrees to 3 degrees to the left - good 200 yards - facing West - the object scooped South and to the East-Northeast 8 degrees to 6 degrees to the left and 1 or 1 1/2 straight in front of him. He was a flare to the immediate right pointing North bound. The following day one of the fairies was captured - This fairie had hit something of a submerged nature, motion of West-Northwest came toward him hovering phase reddish flare. 10 seconds - hovering 5 to 10 minutes - loud noise - then brakes. Hovering was steady. Had sharp distinct edges. Rectangular object would cover 5 to 9 miles.

HDQ. 30TH AIR DIVISION
JULY 19, 1965
Director of Intelligence, O. I. C.
TRUAX FIELD, WISCONSIN
SUBJECT: U. F. O.
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
AFTER MUCH PREPARATION, FILM DEVELOPING AND DISCUSSION WITH MY WIFE, I WISH TO REPORT THE FOLLOWING SIGHTING ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 24, 1965 AT APPROXIMATELY 0235 TO 0255 AT SUNSET RESORT, WEST HARBOR AREA, WASHINGTON ISLAND, DOOR COUNTY, WISCONSIN. WE WERE VACATIONING IN THE AREA.
AT THIS TIME AND PRIOR, I HAD BEEN OBSERVING THE HEAVY STAR COVER WITH 7 X 35 BINOCULARS, ALSO CHECKED A POSSIBLE SHOT OF SAME WITH A RICOH 35MM CAMERA WITH FLASH BY LAYING SAME ON GROUND, WIDE OPEN 30 FT. TO SECOND SETTING. I HOPED THAT I MIGHT CAPTURE IN SILHOUETTE SOME ADJACENT CEDAR TREES. (NO SLIDE) IS THE RESULT WITH STARS ONLY VISIBLE.
AT APPROXIMATE HOURS MENTIONED ABOVE I OBSERVED A BRIGHT ORANGE-CYLINDRICAL OBJECT IN THE DIRECTION OF GILLS ROCK TO THE SOUTHWEST. (SLIDE #19) PINPINTS THE AREA AT INTERSECTING ORANGE LINES. THE OBJECT WAS PROCEEDING IN A N-NW DIRECTION, AT APPROXIMATELY 10,000 (7) FEET. FROM THE 5 TO 10 SECONDS OR SO THAT I OBSERVED THIS UNTIL THE FOLLOWING OCCURRED IT APPEARED TO BE DECREASING IN SPEED. (NEAR STOP CONDITION) AT THIS TIME THE OBJECT (CLEARLY VISIBLE WITH NAKED EYE), SPEWED A POD OF FIVE OR SIX LESSER OBJECTS FROM THE FORWARD END, SIMULTANEOUSLY SCATTERING IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS, ONE OF WHICH ARCHED IN MY DIRECTION AND CAME STRAIGHT IN. NO EXHAUST WAS VISIBLE FROM ANY OF ABOVE AT ANY TIME. I LOST SIGHT OF MAIN OBJECT AS THIS WHITISH SMALLER OBJECT APPROACHED ME, TURNING TO BRIGHT ORANGE AS IT GOT CLOSER. THIS LESSER OBJECT CAME TO A NEAR STOP POSITION AND HOVERED OVER THE GREEN BAY AREA PINPOINTED BY INTERSECTING BLUE LINES ALSO ON (SLIDE #19).

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. 

Transcribing the text from the document:

From launch is hover position approximately 5-8 seconds. This bright orange, saucer-shaped, smaller object now hovers approximately 1/2 mile away. It is emitting a sound similar to a rocket (a rear) as opposed to a jet or whine, continuously. Upon putting the field glasses on same, the orange solid mass with naked eyes appeared as a circular orange mass with rapidly oscillating vertical electrical waves; three or four multi-colored.

This orange mass filled up most of the outer lenses of the glasses thus its assumed short distance away (C/S to 1 mile?).

At this time I awoke my wife who confirmed the above through the glasses. While we were observing the above, the following was also observed at water level approximately 1/2 mile to the right of the arm of land (north) as seen on slide #12.

Directly west of the Resort where we were staying and just south of a red marker buoy presumable from the Escanaba area there appeared a large, bright orange mass shaped somewhat like a figure of 8. This area is estimated on slide #18. You will note there are no islands in the area, no arm of land and Escanaba is approximately 48 miles Northwest. During all this, I attempted with #12 and #13 (slides) to capture all on film. Though framed appear blank, at least through hand viewer and slide projector. Perhaps specialized equipment at your disposal can see something on these or #13 and #14 which came back unmounted. #13 and #14 do have silhouettes visible at an angle to the eye with daylight and magnifying glass although nothing shows on the projector. These slides could prove the best results of this sighting.

At approximately 0300 I called the Coast Guard Station on Plum Island and reported some detail of the sighting to the Petty Officer on duty, assumedly while the foregoing was still in progress. He checked the radar scope while I waited at the phone and reported nothing, and said than that he would enter our conversation in the log book. After my call, I no longer could see anything further (about 10-15 minutes later, and it was getting light so I retired.
