REPORT OF INTELLIGENCE REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object at Little Rock, Arkansas

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

1. SYNOPSIS: Mrs. Silas Sims, Little Rock, Arkansas, reported she observed an unidentified object which appeared in the sky over Little Rock for approximately 1030 hours on 15 September 1952. She took a photograph of an unidentified flying object which appeared in the sky over Little Rock.

2. DETAILS: Mrs. Silas Sims, of the Jones Corporation, 2000 Martin Field, Little Rock, Arkansas, reported to the 11th District Office of Special Investigations, Little Rock, Arkansas, on 29 September 1952, that on 15 September 1952, she was standing on her front porch, facing south, when she observed a disc shaped object in the sky. The object, which had a silver color, was moving in a northerly direction at a rapid rate of speed. She stated that the object had no visible means of propulsion and that it made no noise. She immediately took a photograph of the object with her personal camera. The negative of this photograph, which is approximately 2 by 2 1/2 inches in size, shows an object which appears to be a disc shaped flying object. The photograph was shown to several persons who agreed that the object in the photograph was unidentified.

The original photograph has been reproduced as a 5 by 7 inch print. The original negative has been returned to Mrs. Sims per her request.

5. The information was informally reported to the Sunday Ghibli, an English language weekly published in Tripoli, Libya. The information was carefully and photographically reported and the published article listed many essential details.

Witnesses were one English couple and a Welsh couple, all unidentified. One reliable source reporting this flying lights or objects near Tripoli, Libya told of seeing Spanish speaking Libyan.

6. Solid object 3,000': 15 miles visibil- ity, 4000'. Surface winds 40' 22 knots. A low pressure area was centered that day over Tripoli. The surface temperature a cold front, the air slowly cooling, a rare atmospheric condition for this time of year in North Africa. Both the cold front and the warm area meets nearly stationary in the Tripoli area. 

Winds aloft:  3,000'   210 17 knots

10. No other air traffic.

2. Excerpts of these two Sunday Ghibli articles are copied herewith verbatim:

"FLYING SAUCER SEEN OVER GARIAN GHEEL"

Third Libyan appearance reported

Another "Flying Saucer" has been seen over Libya. This is the third reported appearance of this phenomenon in Libya, which when sighted in other countries has puzzled scientists and military experts alike.

Observers reported that they saw a disc high in the sky over the airfield, and they said it remained perfectly stationary for several minutes. Immediately afterwards, the disc disappeared rather quickly at an amazing rate of speed, after a stay of some two or three minutes. After a day in the mountains, the witness told the newspaper that while he was driving to Tripoli, suddenly the object reappeared and hovered over his car for a matter of four minutes and then disappeared. He said it was about the size of a small aircraft and had a metallic appearance - it shone brightly in the intense sunlight and its shape was typical of the usual descriptions of a "flying saucer."

UNQUOTE

The Ghibli article said that "Tripoli people have been startled by the sight on the eastern sky over the Gharian district of a disc-shaped object, flying at a tremendous speed and silently - It had a faint bluish tint and was a circular light approaching on the horizon." It had a "tail of about twenty metres in length following it." The article added that "this sighting confirms the previous reports from other parts of Libya and the many others reported from various parts of the world."

Confirming these facts, the next witnesses were a "civilian and his wife, walking in the Garden City villa across the opening. They passed that it was some too miles to an and they only stayed for a spended or so before they were behind the buildings".
"It was travelling north west to south east". 

Merrifield reports are still being received confirming the details of last week's "flying saucers".

"No little girl distinctly as a wheel along on the ground motion".

Four Italian residents of Tripoli tested on their sightings near the Tobacco Monopoly Building also confirm the above. 

They thought it was a meteorite until suddenly they realised it was going up instead of down.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
Captain Morey S. Jeffery, Intelligence Officer, 7th Air Rescue Squadron has rejected the possibility that the unidentified object sighted on 22 September 1952 was a weather balloon. The object exceeded the capabilities of any balloon according to Squadron Leader Robert Carter, RAF, intelligence officer.

1. All six objects appeared to be of the same shape, size, and color. They were traveling in a tight formation, with the three front objects slightly higher than the rear three. The objects 
were observed for about 15 minutes, and there seemed to be no appreciable change in their formation or speed during this time. The objects disappeared from sight suddenly, rather than slowly drifting away.
2. Time sighted: 13 minutes, 11.30 located for about 60 seconds.
3. Manner of observation: Visual only.
4. Location of observer: 16 miles south of Tucson, Arizona.
5. Identifying details: Aircraft identification or registration, aviation fuel consumption, and noise; no such data available. There is a preliminary opinion that the objects are possibly a flight of six jet aircraft. The source is considered to be reasonably reliable.
