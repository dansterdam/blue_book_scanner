THIS PAGE, OR PAGES, FROM A FILE OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORTS MAINTAINED BY THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE UNDER PROJECT BLUE BOOK. THESE REPORTS ARE AS RECEIVED AND TYPED WITH NO CHANGES OTHER THAN STANDARDIZATION OF FORMAT. THE INFORMATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WITH THE LIMITATIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL CASE.

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT OR THE MOON, AND ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE OBJECT THE MATCH HEAD COVERS. THIS WILL GIVE AN IDEA OF THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE OBJECT. SINCE NO CALIBRATION OR RANGE INFORMATION IS GIVEN, NO ACCURATE ESTIMATE OF THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.
