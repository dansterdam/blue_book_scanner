At first it was one object which appeared to be a Lighted blob (no defined shape). It moved behind trees and appeared to go out and on again. Then there were 2 similar objects that appeared to the right of the first one. They seemed to move from right to left and appeared to go out and on again. They did not seem to be connected or related other than apparently being lighted objects of some sort. After a short time they all seemed to disappear.

Time of Observation: 0215 hours
Location: Outside of Fairborn in hills.
Duration: 3 hour 27 minutes
Description: The two boys were camping out when they sighted an object in the sky in a small clearing. The object looked like a bright light. The observers were approximately 10 miles from the object. The object was first seen behind trees, then took off into the trees. The object turned white and showed a pulsating motion. The object continued straight and just looked like a bright light to him. The light was considerably brighter than the stars and house lights in the area. There was no smoke from the object. The object was solid and didn't seem to be a searchlight or reflection. There was no change in the position of the stars at the time of the sighting, but there were slight changes through binoculars.
Comments: Confusing and conflicting report.
2. Mr. XXXXX stated that he had reported a sighting about a year ago.
