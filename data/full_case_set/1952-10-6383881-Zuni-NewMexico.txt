The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book record card, which is a form used to document UFO sightings. The text on the form provides details about a sighting that occurred on October 14, 1952 in Zuni, New Mexico. The observer was a high-ranking government executive who reported seeing an illuminated object that performed erratic maneuvers and had a strong spotlight effect. The form includes details about the type of observation, the number of objects, the duration of the sighting, and the observer's conclusions about the nature of the object.

On 15 October 1952, at approximately 1900 hours, Mr. BROOKS, New York, telephonically reported to this office that he had been on the roof top of a building watching searchlights from a nearby carnival which had been set up. He observed strange objects to the east and to the south, which he estimated to be some distance away. The objects were a bright blue color and gradually changed to a pinkish orange color and then back again to bright blue. There was no blinking effect given off by the lights so that it appeared to be a continuous display. He stated that the objects appeared and disappeared, that is, came into view and went out of view, and reappeared at intervals. The objects appeared to be at an eight mile range. The object in the sky was quite high in the sky, almost straight over head. He estimated that the objects were quite high in the sky, in the region of 6,000 to 10,000 feet. The spotlight on the objects came on after the objects appeared and went off when they disappeared. He estimated that the objects gave off a bright light. He estimated that they could not possibly have been airplanes as long and also they did not fall from the sky in the normal manner of aircraft.

Text Output:
Ltr to HQ OSI, Subject: FLYJJJG ? SPECIAL INQUIRY
"FIAME" REPORTED 
SEEN OVER INDIANA
A "big blue flame" that reportedly passed over New York International Airport, invisible, at 7:25 o'clock last night mystified airport personnel.
The phenomenon was observed in the area by a pilot who reported to the control tower being requested to take off to allow a pilot about to land, control over personnel and some mechanics at the field.
The control tower men, who are employees of the Civil Aeronautics Authority, said they had report to their supervisor to what they had observed. They indicated the object declined to describe what they had seen.
It was learned that the "flame" was reportedly seen traveling at high speed, leaving a trail, and that it had no apparent sound. The pilot over Buffalo was talking to the tower at the time and asked the operators if they saw the "flame". The replied that he had seen something, but at the request of the pilot made a record of the incident.
A spokesman for O.S.I. said later that a controller at the airport told him visual observers had seen an object about 1,500 ft. in height, which the object seemed to have dissipated off the periphery of the airport. In accordance with precedure, he notified military authorities.

Dear [REDACTED],

The inclosed report of an unidentified object has been presented to me with an unusual degree of fervor by the author. He states that up until the time he saw the damned thing he was an unalloyed sceptic, but that now he is a thorough-going convert.

His qualifications for unbiased observation are considerably higher than most people's. He further makes the point that he had co-observers with qualifications and prior attitudes similar to his.

Sincerely

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text.

11 Oct. 52 Sighting. Zuni, New Mexico 

It is fair to estimate that it was approximately 6:30 p.m. at the sighting time. 

The object was cylindrical in shape and was quite bright or luminous. It was about 5 or 6 times the size of the first star seen, and seemed to have a slight alternating motion up and down. The distance to the object could not be determined, but it was definitely in the northeast portion of the sky.

The object seems to present the most plausible sighting in the present time and is that seen by experienced observers under rather good conditions. There is no indication whatsoever of any misinterpretation of the observed phenomena and, therefore, it would seem most probable that this is a real sighting of some highly unusual aerial object.
