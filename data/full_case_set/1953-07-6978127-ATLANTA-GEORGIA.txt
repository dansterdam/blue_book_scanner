THE INVASION CONTINUES
Sherman, Texas photo:
Large, unidentified flying object, sighted over Sherman, Texas. The UFO appeared as a "submarine-shaped" object, silvery grey in color, and measuring an estimated 60 to 80 feet in length. It was observed to be flying at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet over Denton, Texas, on April 3, 1953.
Early in the Spring of 1953:
Two young men and two young women, driving alone on a country road near Atlanta, Georgia, reportedly saw an unidentified flying object which passed very close to their car. The UFO hovered for several minutes before speeding away. The incident was reported to local authorities.
Tuesday night in Oklahoma City:
The control tower at Will Rogers Airport received several calls from citizens reporting "strange flying objects." It was later confirmed that no such objects were detected on radar. However, sightings were reported from other parts of the state.
The flag of sightings were reported over a three-night period over the same area. We have been in situations before where sightings occurred over the same area for several consecutive nights, indicating that something is there. The question now is, what are they and where do they come from.

CASE NUMBER: 6978127
DATE: JULY 1953
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: ATLANTA, GEORGIA
DETAILS:
On the evening of July 2, 1953, several witnesses reported seeing a bright light in the sky over Atlanta, Georgia. The light was described as being oval in shape and moving erratically. Attempts were made to photograph the object, but the results were inconclusive.
The case was investigated by officers from the United States Air Force's Project Blue Book, a program established to study unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The investigation included interviews with the witnesses and an examination of the photographic evidence.
Despite the efforts of the investigators, the true nature of the object observed that evening remains unknown. The case was classified as "unidentified" and added to the Project Blue Book files.

OPERATIONS REPORT - 6 THRU 10 JULY 1953

During the past week press activity concerning unidentified flying objects has increased noticeably with the most apparent case in which press publicity was given being centered around the Atlanta, Georgia, area. In this instance this rising concern seems to be centering along in a few near Atlanta where persons have reportedly sighted a flying disk with three creatures attempting to enter it as the car approached. The three men stated that two of the unknowns got back into the "saucer" but the third was hit by their car. They took this object back to Atlanta with them and one of the observers, Mr. R. displayed it in his hardware shop window.

Upon investigation by the 35th Air Division, Intelligence Office, and pressure from local and national news agencies, was assessed the whole story to be a hoax in an attempt to gain publicity. The unknown creature which he had reportedly hit with his car was in fact a monkey which he had chained. A local pet shop reported that three monkeys had recently escaped and one was damaged about the story being a hoax was never in doubt.

Waters stated that before his planned sighting, he had attempted to spread stories of the flying saucers and found people very eager to transmit his rumors.

Text from the document:

7 July 1953
Description
On the night of 7 July 1953, three observers from Atlanta were driving on Highway 78. While passing through Decatur, Georgia, they encountered a brightly lighted saucer-shaped object in the middle of the road. There were three small animals near this object. As the observers bore down on this object, two of the animals entered the "saucer" and escaped. As the "saucer" rose at a 45 degree angle, it turned a light blue color. The third animal was knocked unconscious. After getting out of the car and finding this animal, which was lying on the ground, the observers stayed at the scene and several other automobiles stopped. The animals died in about 30 minutes and was taken to one of the Atlanta newspapers. A reporter for the newspaper called the FBI, who in turn called the incident.

Discussion
This animal was first examined by a local veterinarian who stated that the animal was a small bear-like animal. However, the university authority identified it as a member of the monkey family and not an animal from space. A member of the State Crime Laboratory and another member of the Emory University staff identified the animal as a monkey which had been shaved and from which the tail had been removed. Observers confirmed that the whole animal (except the shaved spot and the lack of a tail) could not get his picture in the paper. Observer was fined $10.00 for obstructing the highway and was released at that time.

Conclusion
Other - None.

Note: This is one of many similar reports received by Project Blue Book.

LIKE ESCAPED CAPTIVE, ASSERTS PET FARM OWNER

Just a Monkey, Experts Say Of Tiny "Martian"

by Katherine Barnwell

Atlanta - (AP) - The "moon man" who was a space man to some, has been traced finally to an impish monkey from a secluded pet farm on the outskirts of Atlanta.

For three months an alleged rash of sightings of the "little man with a bulbous head" sent throngs of reporters, cameramen, and scientists on his trail, but it turned out to be just an ordinary little Rhesus monkey escaped from a farm on McDonough Street, whose owner, J.C. Jones, said:

"He's not a Martian - he's just a monkey. The scientists and the police finally traced it back to me."

Jones said the monkey, believed to be 8 to 10 inches tall, was hardly more than a baby and had the characteristics of a midget Rhesus monkey. It escaped from his farm Saturday and was picked up by police in the Oakland City residential section of southwest Atlanta Monday morning.

The head, the shape of the mouth and teeth were all those of a Rhesus monkey, Jones pointed out, and he said the animal was easily frightened and would run away from the farm's visitors.

A veterinarian, Dr. John Marshall, examined the animal and agreed with Jones that it was a Rhesus monkey, not a Martian, space man, or other similar creature. Jones said the monkey will be returned to the farm from which a veritable colony of similar creatures have often escaped to roam the nearby woods.

"HERE'S 'FLYING SAUCER' AS SEEN BY BARBER WALTER MINTZ WHO LIVES AT 1222 LITTLE RAY STREET."

"SPACE CREATURE" EXAMINED AT CRIME LAB ... VERDICT: "SHAVED MONKEY"

Here are some of the remarks about the alleged "Martian":
* "He was about a foot tall, had a huge head, thin body and arms and legs." 
* "He moved very rapidly and strangely - just like a wind-up toy."
* "He was covered with hair and had a large mouth with tiny eye sockets."
* "When I tried to get close, he ran away at a terrific pace."
* "He came along, looked at me, and then took off like lightning."
* Others said that he had three-fingered hands, no neck, and a face like a lizard.

Martian Is A Monkey 
ATLANTA. July 6--(AP)--The aerial saucer or unidentified flying object which was observed over Atlanta last night, according to a newspaper report, was apparently a monkey belonging to an Atlanta resident. The report stated that the object which was seen by witnesses was an object resembling a saucer or disc which hovered over the city and then disappeared. It was stated that the object seemed to move too slowly to be an airplane and appeared to be controlled by some kind of intelligence. However, it was later determined that the object which was seen was a monkey belonging to a resident of Atlanta which had escaped from its cage and was floating through the air supported by a cluster of balloons to which it was attached. The monkey was said to have been highly trained and was used for exhibition purposes. It was apparently the monkey which was misidentified as a flying saucer or unidentified aerial object. There was no evidence found to indicate that the object was an extraterrestrial spacecraft or anything other than the escaped monkey supported by balloons.

Monkey-Hoaxer Pays a $40 Fine; Sun Valley Any What Were Fooled
KATHARINE BARNWELL, the feisty Atlanta fighter who posed as a space visitor - and cost the state $150 in useless searches - was fined $40 in Fulton County recorder's court Tuesday. She pleaded guilty to charges of disorderly conduct and using loud and profane language.
BARBER ADMITS HOAX
Testifying, she admitted she hadn't come from outer space after all. The girl, who only recently emerged as the Athena of this region, said she was kidding when she said she was from Venus. The space mystery solved, the court assessed the $40 fine and then dismissed the charge. Walnuts thinks the judge was pretty lenient on her, considering the cost of the whole incident. 
Hoax Ends In Health Fine of $40
The girl appeared in court Tuesday night, where she pleaded guilty to the same charges and was fined $40.
"ARE you that?", he questioned. 
"Yes, sir, that's me," she replied.
"Well, I'm going to give you a $40 fine for disorderly conduct - that's all I can do," the judge said. Miss Barnwell thanked him and left the courtroom, apparently relieved that the incident was over.

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a photograph that shows a flying object in the sky. The text on the page is a description of the UFO sighting that occurred on July 31, 1965 in Wynnewood, Oklahoma. It provides details about the sighting, such as the time, location, size, and movement of the UFO.

THE MAIN INVASION WAVE
July 31, 1965. At approximately 1:05 a.m. Saturday morning several persons observed bright lights traveling north, toward Oklahoma City and about five miles west, observed for about two min- utes. During this time it flashed a red light several times.
At 1:05 a.m. the morning of
Saturday, July 31, 1965 a UFO came back to Oklahoma. Wynnewood, Oklahoma police officer identified a flying object approximately 30'x25' of yellowish-white color which flew over their town. The UFO was also being watched simultaine- ously by residents from Tinker AFB, Ft. Worth, Texas. Officer Stiles observed the UFO with his own eyes as it came to a stop in front of their home, when Officer Stiles drove across the street and observed it for five minutes.
Officer Stiles' wife, Gail-Jean continued to watch the UFO until 2:00 a.m. A 'intelligent control' was in- dicated, following the object through 'observation when the object gradually covered 10,000 ft. in approximately one and one-half minutes; it climbed to an estimated altitude of 20,000 ft. confirmed by radar at 6,000 ft. The UFO remained at this altitude for about 15 minutes and then abruptly disappeared approximately 15002000 ft.

Space Story Hoax: Pilot Real Thing To Earthling
ATLANTA, GA.--A newspaper story that a bright object had been sighted near Atlanta was a hoax, according to Air Force officials. One man who reported seeing the object later admitted he had fabricated the story. The Air Force stressed that any authentic reports of unidentified flying objects are promptly investigated, but that the Atlanta incident was a hoax. In addition, Air Force officials said no one was injured when the supposed object was reported. They explained that this type of hoax, designed to create public excitement, is a disservice to the community and to the Air Force program investigating genuine reports of unidentified flying objects.

know about it. Within an hour my
wife, Delphyne Clelland, and
our photographer and Public Relations man were on our way. I
was permitted to interview Officer Shea for two hours. We interviewed over fifty eyewitnesses. We ran down leads and came up with a story for Sunday's paper. Saturday night telephone calls to the home of W. F. Rizer, our Senior Director, interrupted Officer Shea's action.
Upon returning to Oklahoma City
a full report was typed out.
Fred Black, Gene Edwards, and Mike Buchanan said that the Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper located near Edmond, Oklahoma had been receiving UFD reports since 8:50 p.m. So far they had received in the neighborhood of 23 reports all telling the same story. People were observing the UFD's from Purcell north thru Norman to Chandler and Shawnee.
Shawnee reported that the UFD's
were flying in a diamond type formation. Cushing, reported four of
the UFD's. They estimated that
they had four UFD's come on radar at 2100 ft. which coincided with
visual sightings. The UFD's were
all multicolored. They hovered for
as much as two hours, faded out
and then disappeared with great 
speed.
As the night continued on did
the UFD reports continued, Gov.
Moore, Tulsa, Purcell, Chandler, Gape, Del City, Midwest City,
Edmond, El Reno and Oklahoma
City. Then the reports came in
from Texas.
Odessa, Midland, Fort Worth, Canyon and Dallas. New Mexico also
reported UFO's over Hobbs, Carlsbad and Artisia. The UFO reports
that came in from Kans. Guymon,
Belle Plaine, Winfield, Caldwell,
Newkirk, Enid and Wichita also
reported the UFO'S as egg-turtie
shaped flying in formations, making sharp maneuvers and changing colors. By midnight UPD from
Dallas reported that several thousand UFD'S had been sighted over
Texas and Oklahoma. All sightings
were as amazing as they could be.
Reports came in later than they could be handled. Ft. Sill,
Harrah, Yukon, Paula Valley, Stratford, Oklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper, Lindsey, Pauls Valley, Stratford, Lindsay, Pauls Valley, Stratton, Mcalister, Wewoka, Durant, Me
Donald and Sulphur also reported
Eufaula. Also all sightings were
made by Shell Highway Patrol
Units and police officers.
The Air Force has announced
that the "bright objects" seen recently in Washington said initial
study of the flood of sightings indicates they were probably reflections
of the moon, off high altitude in-
struments in the upper atmosphere. "The objects observed may have been the
planet Jupiter or the stars Rigl, Capella, Betelgeuse or Aldebaran,
which are now low in the northwest," the Air Force said. "At the time of the sightings, the maximum and elevation of
the reported objects coincided that
period of time when these stars and astronomical
Jupiter would present the pronouanced phenomenon and temnptation confusion" It was also pointed out that the temperature
varies from Washington to Oklahoma City by sixty degrees or more, which would prevent a
nation-wide observation of the same objects.

On Mars
beam appeared to be hundreds of
miles in length and was observed
for seventy minutes. Professor
Lowill believed they could have
been signals, while the received
Professor W. H. Pickering (Mt. Wilson Observatory, California), On May 20th, 1903, a "chat-a-dike" object was observed near the terminator of Mars by
Lowed, which remained visible for
several days.
From October 10-12, 1924, clouds
appeared to project from the Martial surface and covered the large
region known as Hellas.
On June 4, 1937, Japanese astronomer, Shiro Honda observed
luminous Jacus near Syd Regions on Mars. They observed the unusual phenomenon for a
full five minutes at 850 millimetimes the diameter reflecting
the phenomenon in the Earth.
Saheki sighted a luminous yellow
cloud, 700 miles in diameter and
40 miles above the planet's sur-face. It was believed to be a "brilliant alone" lasting several minutes. Kubrick's most sighting "the cloud" of illumination forming about the center
in July, 1954 when the Mrs observer was Briggs. On representation suddenly brightened for about five seconds.
On August 30, Dr. Gerard P.
Kuiper reported that a "misty
circular" inflatable the right before took a form 1000 miles in length 
and 20 miles wide. The following
day, the cloud elongated to a
length of 3000 miles and had a 
width of 200 miles in the strange
shape of the letter "E".
