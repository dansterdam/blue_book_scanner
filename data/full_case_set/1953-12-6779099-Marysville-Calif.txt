As an OCR system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

Lc Gol. Hector Quintanilla
Page 6

14 June 1968

It occurred at a small airport and the duration was one and a half minutes. A followup should have been made to determine whether there were other potential witnesses. Since it occurred at an airport on December 28, it is possible that there were no other witnesses available. Must be carried as unidentified, single witness.

15. 12 August 1965, Ramona, California.
One witness duration of sighting only 15 seconds. Witness was a 67-year-old lady. A bright light was observed at 9 p.m. daylight savings time. The object was in the air no longer than 15 seconds and did not stop. The object made no noise. This sighting occurred after 6 p.m. at night. Must be listed as unknown (danger data).

16. 26 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire.
I have in my files for 26 February 1966, Manchester, New Hampshire. I do not seem to find a Bartlett, New Hampshire case. See attached supplemental sheet A. 

17. 17 July 1966, Centerville, Ohio.
Temporarily not in file. Will study this case when I visit Dayton.

18. 9 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.
Since by an admitted breakdown in communications the Dover Air Force Base delayed some five months in investigating this case, all I have is the NICAP report. Evaluation pending my getting a copy of the Air Force investigation of same, based on NICAP report, the details is obviously unidentified.

19. 12 February 1967, Grand Rapids, Michigan.
I have only the card on this case, but judging from it there seems to be a possibility that this sighting was caused by low-flying birds reflecting light. The sighting lasted 4 to 10 seconds, and witness mentions a high-pitched chirping noise.

20. 1 April 1967, Wellington or Loco, Texas.
I had a great personal involvement in this case, much of it undoubtedly not in the file.
