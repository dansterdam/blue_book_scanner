The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an illustration that appears to be a schematic diagram or drawing related to the motion or trajectory of an observed object. The diagram shows some lines and curves that could represent the path or motion of an unidentified object.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known angular size of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this, how much of the object was covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words, the object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance which you saw.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the path of an object in the sky, with instructions to place the object's position on point "A" on the curve and indicate how high the object was above the horizon. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road, with instructions to indicate the position of the object when it was first seen.

The text in the document is as follows:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve that shows the path of the object. Place a "B" on the sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it. Refer to a similar sketch or example of how to complete this drawing.
