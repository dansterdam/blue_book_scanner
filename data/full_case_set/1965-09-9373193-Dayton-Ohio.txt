The image contains a handwritten report describing the observer's sighting of a meteor on the evening of September 7th. There does not appear to be any photograph present in this document.

Here is the text from the document, produced as an OCR system would output it:

8 September 1965

To: TD4 TDBA (UFO)
WPAFB

From: Troy, Ohio 45394 Kings Rd.

Subject: Meteor

On the evening of September 7th, at about 7:10 PM I was riding a bike in a generally southwest direction (West by South) when I saw the meteor.

I started to look over my left shoulder(or to the south) to check on traffic behind me when I saw the meteor.
It was about 60° off the horizon and looked to be travelling the same direction that I was taking.
I watched it for perhaps three or four seconds and then it burned out.
There were no cars or any farm equipment close by, and it was very quiet. There was absolutely no noise from the fireball.

Later, as I changed my course to one almost due south I glanced around to see if any other objects were in the sky, but there were none. Nor, did I see any sign of the meteor after it burned out.

I'm sure this was a meteor - and it was a beauty!

Text Extracted from the Document:

Meteorite Seen Streaking Across Sky
This report tells of a "bright light" that was seen "streaking across the sky about 7:15 p.m. yesterday." The object was seen by several people who described it as something "like a shooting star but much larger." It was said to have traveled in a southwesterly direction. Some witnesses said it looked like "a very fantastic object" and "something from outer space" that was very fast-moving and bright. One person said it appeared "about 100 yards in front of his house" and lasted only a few seconds.

Meteorite Seen (continued from page 1)
The report continues, saying that the meteorite was observed by other people and that the descriptions of it varied. Some said it was "round and bright with a blue-green tail," while others described it as "long and thin with a bright tail." The object moved quickly through space and was more or less continuous, with no sudden changes in brightness. The meteorite was burning up as it passed through the atmosphere, creating the wide band that was observed. Everyone agreed that it was an unusual phenomenon, and some speculated that it was a piece of a satellite or asteroid burning up.

Dear General:

In res: Missile over Kentucky

In the late afternoon of September 7th, at just about 6:00 o'clock Central Standard Time (7:00 P.M. Eastern Standard), a missile was observed to be proceeding on a northeast course.

The rounded forward end of this missile was illuminated by the setting sun in the west. The missile was traveling in a straight and had a gold metallic appearance. There was a mist or white cloud around the missile, from away a distance.

The trajectory followed the surface of the earth at about a 90° angle to where it appeared to level off.

The missile left a light greenish-yellow or yellowish-green vapor behind where it passed out of view.

The missile, or some other flying object or objects, was seen by people at the time all the way from Louisville to Cincinnati, but I have a creditable report that it was observed from my own home on the great Claiborne Farm horse breeding establishment, located on the Ohio River, south of Cincinnati. I may state the missile emerged from behind some trees on my far right, and sped across the sky until it went out of sight.

This missile went at the speed of a super-sonic plane, or perhaps two or three times that speed.

There was no sound.

I was standing by my side at the time, and accustomed to outdoor observation, said immediately, "Take that! A warhead!"

Artickee machine from Paris, Kentucky, Enterprise and the Cincinnati Enquirer, relative to object or objects seen by others at approximately the same time, the early evening of September 7th.

Is it possible a stage of the missile may have dropped off in the vicinity? At any rate, I pass this information to you and I saw the observed detail.

From: Troy, Ohio 78 Rd.

Subject: Meteor

On the evening of September 7th, at about 7:10 PM I was riding a bike in a generally Southwest direction (West by South) when I saw the Meteor.
 
I started to look over my left shoulder(or to the south) to check on traffic behind me when I saw the meteor. 

It was about 60o off the horizon and looked to be travelling the same direction that I was taking.

I watched it for perhaps three or four seconds and then it burned out. 

There were no cars or any farm equipment close by, and it was very quiet. There was absolutely no noise from the disappearance.

Later, as I changed my course to one of almost due south I glanced around to see if any other objects were in the sky, but there were none. Nor, did I see any sign of the meteor after it burned out.

I'm sure this was a meteor - and it was a beauti

In re: Missile over Kentucky

What has been written here about a flying missile need not be discounted. In any way, what has been described is likely based on outdoor observation, having spent time in the aggregate half a dozen years of my life on many night-time and occasional daylight investigations of military and civil aircraft. I am highly trained in outdoor observations, and I do know to look sharp for his safety - you can appreciate the need for careful observation in long range celestial activities.

If Cape Kennedy cannot account for the missile, then I suggest most earnest consideration of which from Cuba.

Sincerely,

P.S: A check with a compass shows that I was looking almost due northeast, actually on a 360 sight, when the missile passed by from my right to my left.

Transcribed text from the document:

Investigated the sighting report of the A. C. 0. C. dated 7 September 1965 at 20:43 hrs. Interviewed the officer on duty at time of sighting and obtained additional supplement and complete details regarding the incident. The initial observations I made were against the background of the night atmospheric observations I made earlier on the evening of 7 September 1965 where the initial sighting was reported. As called, 50-called object struck the M.D. tower and was reported at several locations. The tower is also located at the center of the calling and the brightness seemed to intensify just prior to the calling and the brightness seemed to intensify just prior to the calling and the right-ness remained afterwards for a period of time as the brightness seemed to die out. The lighting condition in employment was apparently a sinuous glow at a distance from the light of the tower and as immediate as the tower itself and commenced a pulsating or pulsing action which seemed to encompass the entire area. This lasted approximately 1 to 1 1/2 minutes and was observed by a number of officers. The location of the light source appeared to be in the general area of the radar tower but the exact point of origin could not be determined. There were no photographic or other sighting evidence made available. The officer in question had not previously had such an experience and was at a loss to definitively explain what he had observed. I could find no physical evidence at the scene to support the sighting and there were no unidentified radar targets or other substantiating data. In my best judgement, this case can be reasonably explained as the illumination of the radar tower itself through natural atmospheric conditions prevailing at the time. There were no physical indications of any residual or conclusive residue as we would expect with an actual UFO contact.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

It was just eight. The light, that is, was on and stationary as I saw it. As it was easily more than three or four times as bright as any star, I immediately realized that this was no ordinary astronomical object. The illumination and color of the light were quite unlike anything I have previously observed in the sky. It had a very peculiar and distinct quality about it.

This seems that if I had been asked a question at that point, I could not have answered it satisfactorily. I was so amazed and puzzled by what I was observing that I just stood there watching it intently. The times that I recall of a similar experience ware very, very few.

Some times that go by this early in the morning are so brief, so that I cannot regard this observation as long or to have lasted over some great rate of time. From some fifteen seconds to possibly as many as thirty seconds I believe to be a fairly accurate time estimate.

Since I have attached many notes with the sighting, I feel that it is very significant and worth of careful evaluation. I have seen no other movement than what I have described, and any maneuver or change in brightness is simply what I have stated.

I have attached many notes with the

The transcribed text from the document is as follows:

"I am writing to report a rather peculiar incident which occurred on the evening of September 9, 1965 in Dayton, Ohio.

I was driving north on Highway 25, north of Dayton, at around 9:45 PM. The night was clear and quite dark. Suddenly, I noticed an extremely bright light in the sky ahead of me, moving rapidly from right to left across my field of vision. 

The light appeared to be shaped like an ellipse, and was much brighter than any star or planet I have ever seen. It seemed to be at an altitude of perhaps 5,000 feet and was moving at a tremendous speed. I would estimate its speed to be around 1,000 mph. As it moved across the sky, it seemed to accelerate and change direction slightly a few times. 

After observing this phenomenon for perhaps 10-15 seconds, the light suddenly disappeared from view. I have no idea where it went or how it could have just vanished. I am not the kind of person who is prone to seeing strange things in the sky, but this was certainly one of the most impressive and perplexing sights I have ever witnessed.

I wanted to report this incident to the proper authorities, in case it may be of interest to your project. If you have any questions or would like any additional information, please let me know.

Yours very truly,
[Signature]
Dayton, Ohio"

Dear Sir,

Supplementing my December 27th letter on the varhead sighted by me over Paris, recently. In September 1965, when I think may have happened, a missile firing from a submarine but before it hit the target, it dropped off and disintegrated, producing the effect seen in the skies and lights.

I do hope that our naval base in Cuba is equipped with a seismograph, so as to be informed thoroughly about any missile firings from that area.

SINCERELY,

Dear Sir:

I am writing this letter regarding our earlier letter of December 16 concerning the sighting of a circular unidentified flying object which is entering the earth's atmosphere at a high rate of speed, and which is considered to be a closer distance for this time of the year.

Although we do not presently endorse books pertaining to the subject of unidentified flying objects, you may wish to read two books on this subject which are generally considered a reliable source of information. These books are "Flying Saucers and the Straight-Line Mystery" by Coral E. Lorenzen, and "Anatomy of a Phenomenon" by Jacques Vallee.

Dear General:

In re: Missile over Kentucky

In the late afternoon of September 7th, at just about 5:00 o'clock Central Standard Time (6:00 p.m. EDT), a silver missile was observed falling from the sky over Kentucky's Diamond field, accompanied by a thunderous roar.

The rounded forward end of this missile was illuminated by the setting sun as it came down. The missile was tubular in shape and had a gold metallic appearance. There was a mist or white cloud around the missile, from away behind the missile according to observers.

The trajectory followed the surface of the earth at about a 90° angle to the earth. An unusual trail was visible behind the missile as it traveled.

The missile left a light greenish-yellow or yellowish-green vapor behind where it passed. 

The missile, or some other flying object or objects, was seen by people at the time this was observed, according to witnesses. One of them had a camera but had not had time to get it in use.

The owner's home on the west was informed. I am now having a map prepared showing the locations from which the missile was observed, and the path it followed.

This missile went at the speed of a super-sonic plane, or perhaps two or three times that speed.

There was no sound.
Mrs. - - - - - -, located by my side at the time, and accustomed to outdoor observation, remarked "It was a missile, it happened to was a guidance."

Articles are attached from Paris, Kentucky, Daily Enterprise and the Cincinnati Enquirer, relating to the object or objects seen by others at approximately the same time, the early evening of September 7th.

It is possible a stage or the missile may have dropped off in the vicinity?

At any rate Ms. ---------, say the overhead itself.

In re: Missile over Kentucky

What has been written here about a flying missile need not be discounted in any way, and can be taken 100% for granted. I am high on the list of people who has had 20 years of experience with so-called flying saucers. I have consulted many military pilots, radar experts, and other experts of various kinds.
If a person spent six years of his life in a combat, he would have the same instinct for fear of death that a deer has when it hears a twig snap in the woods. That is the way I feel about flying saucers. 

If Cape Kennedy cannot account for the missile, then I suggest most earnest consideration of the conclusion it was not from Ohio.

Sincerely,

P.S: I agree with above that I was looking almost due northwest, my lights on a 40° sight, when the missile passed me very right to left.
