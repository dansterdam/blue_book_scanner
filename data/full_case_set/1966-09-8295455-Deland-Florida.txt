Supplemental Information

The young lady appeared very sincere when she was questioned about her sighting and did indicate that she had an unidentified object pass over her head at a low altitude. She wanted to provide this information. I had to encourage her several times to make this information.

The course of identity cannot be ascertained at this time. The local police station stated that they received no reports of any unusual object sightings or activity on that night. Although Sanford Naval Air Station had aircraft flying that night, the Captains log does not show evidence of any unusual activity. The local airport reports shut-down operations after 1600 hours daily. New Smyrna Beach Coast Guard confirmed that they had no sightings and no reports of any unusual activities.

In summary: A clear night and no obstructions to visibility could rule out a weather phenomenon, but it does not completely rule out an unusual flying sighting. Although the lady was interrupting aircraft proceeding to Sanford Naval Station, McCoy Memorial Field and other nearby airfields, Sanford Naval Air Station had no record of any unusual activities on that night.

The image appears to show a black and white photograph of a UFO or unidentified flying object. The object is depicted as a bright, disk-shaped form in the sky, with a trail or streak behind it. Below the image, there is some handwritten text that says "As described by witness" followed by a redacted portion.

As for the text in the document, here is the output from the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system:

As described by witness
