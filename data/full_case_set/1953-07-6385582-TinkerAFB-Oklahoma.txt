Transcription of the text in the document:

I have an object which I would estimate between 25,000 and 30,000 feet
high and clearly visible to me. This object appeared to be hovering
motionless above the area for about 10-15 minutes. There was no trail or
exhaust, and no sound was apparent. All the time I was watching it,
they seemed to be stationary, moving neither to the right or to the
left, nor to the fore or aft. I was watching this with the naked eye.

The time was 19:15 and it lasted for approximately (30) minutes.
I visually observed the object through the binoculars and also viewed it
directly with the naked eye from the control tower. He went on to tell
me that I could observe this object from the water tower. It was
distinctly over my head and appeared to be stationary. It did not
appear to be flashing or traveling at a high rate of speed.

I have been working in the control tower for two (2) years.
The sky was clear behind the object. There were scattered clouds, but
the object appeared to be above these clouds. The size was about the
same as the full moon, and it appeared round in shape. It hovered
motionlessly for about a half hour, and they told us that is about the
time they watched. I spotted the object at 19,000 feet. It appeared to
be about the size of a basketball at arm's length. I walked out on the
field and spotted it directly over the field and looked at it for a few
minutes. I watched the object and noticed it was not flashing any lights
and made no sound. I conclude that this was not an aircraft, jet, or
helicopter, as we would have been able to hear the noise. I watched the
object through the binoculars and it appeared to be metallic and
somewhat lens-shaped. It was just sitting there motionlessly, not going
up, down, or sideways. It disappeared from view and I turned to the
observer and asked what he thought, and they said they did not know what
it was. I then called my sergeant and turned in this report that I filled
out to the cryptic matter.

Text from the document:

2'to objects I saw this point in silene and .thia is what I saw. Bigger than a pea. I just saw one object. This was very tall, smaller than a ball. It started to slow down, it just disappeared. I was looking at it, It was disappearing.

It gave a bluish flash this time it was when I saw this object. I observed

I swear this object was the round type.

The the air force base control tower man I observed this object it was about 30,000 feet up directly obove the base I observed this object for about two minutes.

In the vest there were a few scattered clouds. Just a little after the object disappeared. in the east it was clear.

I didn't take any photographs nor cinema at this time.

I don't see any air traffic at this time.

The text found in the document is as follows:

The object was round, very shiny like chrome. I would estimate it to be from 25,000 to 30,000 feet high. It seemed to be stationary and no trail. It would blot out the sky as it passed through the haze. I didn't see the object until it disappeared looking at it through glasses. Considering this would be doing other objects. Every one of a while either side to the horizon would disappear.

I watched this object approximately 21 minutes.

I watched it through field glasses and with the naked eye. The field glasses glass shown the object more clearly.

I was at Tinker Air Force Base Control tower when I saw this object. The object seemed directly overhead at an estimated altitude of 30,000 to 35,000 feet high.

I have been working in the control tower for one year.

The day was clear and a few clouds. The object was very clearly except for some clouds way off on the horizon in the haze and a few wisps.

I didn't take any photographs and didn't see any fragments.

There was one aircraft about 2,000 feet. This aircraft was nowhere near the object.

Considering the way the object disappeared, I don't think it was a weather balloon.

I saw a white spot in the air. It looked like a star, going out, 
there was no trail nor contrail. It came straight down very fast, and 
there was no sound. Where it went I can't say, it just vanished.

I don't know what this is, I can't think of this object. I watched it
with binoculars. I couldn't find it with binoculars when I scanned the 
sky. 

This object was directly overhead so finder air crews could have seen it. Idea how high it was.

From what I tell the present time I have been a member of the Air Force 
for several years and employed as a millwright air force base.

The weather was clear, I don't remember any clouds. There was something 
on the horizon but nothing unusual.

I have observed weather balloons, but never saw one as bright as this 
one was.

No fragments or physical evidence of the object were observed.

It looked like it was twice or Tinker Air Force base and south of Oklin Tinker AFB 35 was 15,000 or 29,000 deed likeness.

I have been on the chart force for eleven (11) years. I am usually opposed to the weather and observe aircraft over the field.

The weather was clear, the sun shining. There were a few floating clouds.

I believe it was a weather balloon. The sun was shining on it.

I saw one object. It was round and looked like a balloon. It was brilliant in color, changing from small near-objects to the broad horizon. At first it had a trail and then it just vanished there was no sound.

It was about 1935 when I saw it. I timed it about ten (10) minutes.

I observed the object visually from the ground and used binoculars. The balloon appeared to stand over the horizon 7,500 feet in the air. When I got the glasses on it, it looked like a balloon twelve to fifteen inches in diameter.

The object was directly overhead (Tinker Air Force Base).

I have been in the Air Force at Tinker Air Force Base for eleven and one half months. I view aircraft regularly and this was no aircraft. The weather was clear, there were no clouds - nothing to block the vision. 

There was no fragments or physical evidence of the object.

I doubt it was a weather balloon. I would judge the object to be about 10,000 feet high.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing an observation of an unidentified object.

I saw this (1) object. It was white or silver in color. I would say that it had approximately a 20 to 30 foot diameter. It was almost directly overhead, and a little to the south. I sighted this object around 1935 and I watched it for about a minute.

I was uncertain as to the exact size, as I could not determine the distance to the object very well from the ground. I should think the object was visual from the ground. 

The object was almost directly overhead at a little under 2,000 feet altitude where I have been on the guard force at Tinker Air Force Base for some time. I then in the infantry (1.5) years. I was observing aircraft carriers observing aircraft.

There was very little surface winds. There was a small haze in the atmosphere.

It seemed to me that this object was around 1,000 feet to 1,500 feet. I don't know the exact altitude as there was no reflections or physical evidence of the object that I observed.

21 JULY 1953

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATAC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt.:

This is quite a batch coming back at you. I think the idea of being in readiness with a press release is a good idea. I should like to have Dr. [redacted] comments on our pinchbottle cases.

In two cases here we are taking the liberty of sending out Form A6, with the request that the editor having informed to us an earlier possible astronomical significance, and would they oblige us by filling out the report. If you have any objection to this procedure let us know.

As to seeing you in the near future, I hope so too. Did you know I am sailing for Europe on August 28th? I would like to send you a postcard because I know of your interest in cosmic rays. But I must leave here by September 1st, so the only time we may get to see each other would be this coming week.

There appears to be only two possible pinchbottles in this last batch: The 21 June Okinawa and the 22 June Goose AFB. On both of these I should like to request a complete report and follow-up.

The Okinawa one may yet prove to be a balloon, though the evidence is against it. Object: Bright white and clearly distinguishing into cloud with relative velocity of 60 knots. I think the best thing to do is to wait for further data. I am asking Jen to handle both you and me on these follow-up bounces unless we are told some other way to proceed.

The Goose AFB also needs follow-up with special attention to the 9 questions on our Form 'Eyes'.

Now as to the others: we pass by with a smirk the little monkey man. As to the rarer 'Unger' cases: how come such an epidemic of balloons? Can't they tell a balloon from a hole in the ground? Most interesting of the Tinker batch was only 3rd. Glad to see that a camera was used. What did the pictures look like? And on the July 6th case, I must admit the observer.

On the others, the notes we have made on the forms I just about cover the case. We have some reference 'Tx's but we don't know to what they refer. They would probably be important only if they refer to our pinchbottle cases.

We have developed new comments and a careful analysis of what we think of this array rather quickly. Please give an indication of the only 6 cases of the handling and sightings worth following up. That either you or this office have on this method handled.

Cordially,

Text from the document:

I saw the object at 1930 hours and observed it for 20 minutes.
The object appeared to be high-powered and traveling at high speed. I was standing still. I did not use field glasses or binoculars.
When I saw the object, it was at 270°7' azimuth and 59° elevation. The object appeared to be about 4,500 feet high.
The object has been reported on the ground from Tinker Air Force Base for eleven (11) years.
The weather was very clear and calm. The wind was approximately 15 to 20 mph from the south southeast. Around 1900 hours, the weather conditions changed in approximately 2 minutes.
I did not take any photographs and did not obtain any negatives.
After 15 to 20 minutes, the object disappeared in a very high, fast climb toward the west about 1-1/2 minutes.
The object appeared to have a bright glow and it remained on at all times. The color of the object was white, similar to chrome at any time.

Transcribed text:

The ob.ject looked round and was real shiny. It was probably still slow as it passed a couple of cars was around the field and stopped. Once in a while it would dim the lights on the cars. There was a light like a star or planet in the center.

It was about 1215 when I saw the object and I was about 20 minutes.

This object was visual from the ground.

I was one (the the 377 bomber) it seemed about 150 feet or more. When I say this object it seemed about 150 feet or more. I don't know why I didn't get a better look at it, it was very bright. The object was about 1000 feet I would say.

I have been in the Guard Forces at Tinker Air Force base for 21 years.
The weather was very clear and there was a slight breeze.
I didn't take any photographs nor obtained any fragments.
There was no aircraft in the air.

The object looked round just like a big basketball, it was bright white - it looked like it was made of a highly polished metal surface. It was about 15 to 20 feet in diameter.

It was hovering about 50 feet above the ground and there was no sound. There was no exhaust and no glow.

I saw this object at 1930 and I watched it for one (1) hour.

The object was visible from the ground. I first saw this just slightly that the bright light attracting my attention. 

It was at east end the 77ft hanger the guard was on duty, were it was hovering.

I would say it was at least 35,000 to 40,000 feet high.

There were 4 jet clouds in the west, 24 to 30 miles high in the west.

I did not take any pictures and no fragments were obtained. 

Along toward 1235 there was a 40-50 cane just flying high over the field.

The object I saw started getting dim and faded away until you couldn't see it.

As requested, here is the text output from the OCR:

On 2 July 1953, I saw one object. It was round as a balloon or a cigar. As it was about 1,000 to 1,500 feet up, it could be seen clearly. It would be about 40 feet long. It did not seem to be anything we could recognize. It seemed to stand still, but it moved a little. It did not seem to be anything known to us. It moved up, it moved down, but it did not seem to go straight up, as it did not fly very high. If it had been a balloon, it would have gone straight up. 

I saw this object between 1930 and 1940. I stood to the side and observed it for 10 or 15 minutes. It seemed to be 1,000 to 1,500 feet up. It did not seem to move very fast. It would come to a stop and then move on again. It seemed to cover from 1/4 to 1/2 mile while I observed it. It would come back to practically the same spot, as if it would come back to the same place.

I observed this object through binoculars for 7-850 from the ground. The object was about 5° 3' from directly overhead (higher air force base). 

I have had quite a bit of experience observing aircraft in the air. I was in the army for 4 (4) years and I was a pilot for 3 years. This was not anything known to me nor anything I have ever seen before. 

The weather was clear. There was a blue sky background.
The object was 40,000 to 50,000 feet high.

I didn't see the object move at all. The object was directly overhead.

I observed this object for approximately 1 or 2 seconds at a time.

I observed this object visually from the ground.

I was the 32nd person who reported this, when I saw this object. I couldn't estimate how high the object was.

I have been on the guard force, Tinker AFB, for about 13 1/2 years. I have had a lot of weather balloons and other objects seen in the sky during this time.

I don't remember about the weather.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line, with instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when first seen, and a "B" on the same curved line to indicate how high the object was when last seen. The second sketch shows a larger scene, with a person in the foreground and buildings/landscape in the background. There is also a smaller inset sketch in the top right corner.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will extract all the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
