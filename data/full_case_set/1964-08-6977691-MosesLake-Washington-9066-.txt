The aircraft was immediately dispatched to the area and the crew's report is as follows:

1. At approximately 1515 hours on 6 August 1964, an unusual object approximately 40-45 feet in diameter was sighted due east of the Larson AFB landing pattern at an altitude of approximately 2000 feet.

2. The object appeared to be hovering and ascended at a rapid rate of speed to an estimated altitude of 5000 feet where it remained stationary for approximately 3-4 minutes.

3. The object then accelerated at a very rapid rate of speed and disappeared from view toward the east-northeast.

4. The object was tracked visually and by radar at Larson AFB.

5. Ground observers in the Moses Lake, Washington area also reported sighting the object.

This report is submitted for your information and evaluation.

PROJECTBLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14

A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1. To obtain and analyze all available information on unidentified flying objects.
2. To determine the extent of interest and concern in unidentified flying objects on the part of the general public, the military, the scientific community, and the news media.
3. To determine the over-all effect of the unidentified flying object program on the Air Force.
4. To utilize the knowledge gained from the investigation and analysis of unidentified flying objects to reduce the number and to increase the efficiency of investigations.

B. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 
1. Analysis of reports received during the period 1 July 1952 through 31 May 1955 shows that about 22 per cent are classified as unidentified; the remainder are identified as known astronomical, meteorological, or man-made objects or are classified as insufficient information for identification.
2. The percentage of unidentified reports fluctuates from year to year and from month to month. From July 1952 through June 1953, the percentage of unidentified reports was about 30 per cent. During the following year, the percentage dropped to about 20 per cent, and during the first 5 months of the third year it was about 22 per cent.
3. About 700 of the reports received during the period 1 July 1952 through 31 May 1955 were not considered for analysis, either because they did not contain sufficient information or because the reports were received too late to be processed in time for Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14.
4. The sudden increase in reports during 1952 created an overload on the investigative and analytical facilities available to Project Blue Book. The percentage of unidentified reports increased during this period of overloading.
5. Analysis of the characteristics of unidentified reports shows that they do not contain any significant information that cannot be explained by present scientific knowledge or that would lead to the existence of new physical principles.
6. The public, military, scientific, and news media interest in unidentified flying objects is considerable. Over the 3-year period, there was a steady increase in the number of reports submitted and the degree of publicity attached to them.
7. The major impact of the unidentified flying object program on the Air Force has been the time, effort, and personnel required for the investigation and analysis of reports. The over-all effect, both psychological and economic, has been considerable.

INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS OF REPORTED UFO SIGHTING

1. INTRODUCTION

On August 6, 1964, a report of a UFO sighting was received from Moses Lake, Washington. This report was investigated and analyzed by Project Blue Book personnel.

2. DETAILS OF SIGHTING

According to the report, a local resident observed an unidentified aerial object near Moses Lake on the evening of August 6, 1964. The witness claimed the object was circular in shape, approximately 30 feet in diameter, and hovered silently approximately 50 feet above the ground before departing at a high rate of speed.

3. INVESTIGATION

Project Blue Book investigators were dispatched to the sighting location to gather additional information and evidence. An aerial search of the area was conducted, but no further sightings of the object were reported. Ground exploration of the site revealed an apparent ground disturbance, which was photographed and is included with this report.

4. ANALYSIS

Based on the witness testimony and the physical evidence gathered, Project Blue Book analysts were unable to conclusively identify the nature of the reported UFO. The case remains classified as "unidentified" pending further information or similar reports that may help determine the origin of the sighting.

5. CONCLUSION

The Moses Lake UFO sighting of August 6, 1964, remains an open case in the Project Blue Book files. No definitive explanation for the reported object has been determined. Further investigation may be warranted if additional information or similar sightings come to light.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

INCIDENT INVESTIGATED BY: J. ALLEN HYNEK, CONSULTANT, U.S. AIR FORCE PROJECT BLUE BOOK

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING

DATE OF INCIDENT: AUGUST 6, 1964

LOCATION OF INCIDENT: MOSES LAKE, WASHINGTON

WITNESS: MRS. ROBERT TABER

TYPE OF INCIDENT: VISUAL SIGHTING

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT: ON AUGUST 6, 1964, MRS. ROBERT TABER REPORTED SIGHTING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN THE SKY NEAR MOSES LAKE, WASHINGTON. MRS. TABER DESCRIBED THE OBJECT AS SILVER IN COLOR, ROUND IN SHAPE, AND APPROXIMATELY 40 FEET IN DIAMETER. SHE STATED THAT THE OBJECT HOVERED IN THE AIR FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE FLYING AWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.

INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS: PROJECT BLUE BOOK CONSULTANT J. ALLEN HYNEK CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT. AFTER REVIEWING MRS. TABER'S ACCOUNT AND EXAMINING THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE, HYNEK CONCLUDED THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED WAS MOST LIKELY A WEATHER BALLOON OR OTHER KNOWN AERIAL PHENOMENON. NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION WAS DEEMED NECESSARY.

CONCLUSION: THIS INCIDENT WAS CLASSIFIED AS "UNIDENTIFIED" BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK, THOUGH THE INVESTIGATING CONSULTANT BELIEVED IT TO BE A CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY INVOLVING A KNOWN AERIAL OBJECT.
