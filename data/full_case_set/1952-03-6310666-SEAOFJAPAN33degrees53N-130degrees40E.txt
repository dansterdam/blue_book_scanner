UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
SEA OF JAPAN, KYUSHU AREA
MARCH 1, 1952
PREPARED BY: CAPT. R.F. CROFHAUS, USAF INTEL. O.
SUMMARY: (Content of text summarizing the report)
1. ON MAR. 1, 1952, THE PILOT AND CREW OF A C-54 TYPE TROOP CARRIER SQUADRON (H), APO 75, SIGHTED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. THE C-54 WAS RETURNING TO ASHIYA AIR BASE 15 MILES WEST OF THE BASE, OVER THE SEA OF JAPAN AT AN ALTITUDE OF 11,500 FEET, AND THE C-54 WAS TURNING TO 300 DEGREES. THE PILOT, LT. E.J. WEED, AO 2053855, STATED THAT THE OBJECT WAS HEADING 220 DEGREES, APPEARED TO BE OVAL-SHAPED, AND THAT BOTH THE TRAIL AND THE OBJECT WERE BRIGHT ORANGE IN COLOR. THE OBJECT MAINTAINED THE TRAIL WAS APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET IN LENGTH, AND THAT IT SEEMED TO GRADUALLY FADE FROM SIGHT.
2. THE OTHER TWO CREW MEMBERS, 2D LT. T.G. CAMIDGE, AO 1911543, CO-PILOT, AND 2LT. R.L. ARCHIBALD, ENGINEER, CONCURRED IN THE ABOVE ACCOUNT OF THE SIGHTING.
3. LT. WEED FURTHER STATED THAT THE OBJECT WAS DEFINITELY NOT A JET AIRCRAFT - HE HAS ALSO SEEN JETS OPERATING WITH AFTERBURNERS DURING PERIODS OF DARKNESS, AND THE CREW WERE VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE OBSERVATION, STATING THAT THEY ALMOST FORGOT TO LAND THE AIRCRAFT BECAUSE THE OBJECT SIGHTED HAD CAPTURED THEIR COMPLETE ATTENTION.
