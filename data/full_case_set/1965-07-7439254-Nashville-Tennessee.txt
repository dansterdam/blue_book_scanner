There does not appear to be any photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, specifically a report about an observation of an unidentified object in the Nashville, Tennessee area on July 30, 1965.

The text in the document reads as follows:

PAGE 3 RWPTPRA19I5 UNCLAS
LOCATION OF OBSERVERS. AIRCRAFT WAS FURTHER POSITIVELY IN THE AREA OF THE DESCRIBED OBSERVATION AT THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION. THE CESSNA 172 TOWED OBJECT WAS MOUNTED BENEATH THE AIRCRAFT AND CAN BE EXTENDED TO 30 FEET IN LENGTH, EIGHT FEET IN WIDTH AND CONSISTS OF MANY SMALL LIGHT BULBS. THE ACTION OF THESE BULBS IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE NEWS FLASHER ON THE TIME SQUARE NEWS BUILDING IN THAT WORDS ARE SPELLED OUT IN A CONTINUOUS MOVING MOTION, THEREBY GIVING THE ILLUSION TO A DISTANT GROUND OBSERVER OF AN OBJECT SPINNING. THE LIGHTS ARE CLEAR AND THE AIRCRAFT IS CREAM AND BURNT ORANGE IN COLOR WITH A ROTATING RED BEACON ON THE VERTICAL STABILIZER. THESE PHYSICAL FACTS ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENT COLORS SIGHTED BY THE OBSERVER. THE LOCATION OF THIS AIRCRAFT WAS VERIFIED BY CROSS CHECK WITH POSITION OF OBSERVERS EACH TIME THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED BY SEVERAL OBSERVERS, BY BERRY TOWER AS THE OBSERVERS CALLED IN. TOWER HAD CONTINUOUS RADIO CONTACT WITH AIRCRAFT. VISIBILITY ON THE NIGHT OF OBSERVATION WAS FIVE MILES AND HAZE AND CAUSED LIGHTS OF CITY TO REFLECT ON TOWED OBJECT IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO PRESENT AN OBSERVATION SUCH AS SIGHTED BY OVERVERS WAS THE OBJECT UNDER TOW BY THIS CESSNA AIRCRAFT AND THAT NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED. A LIST OF OTHER OBSERVERS NAMES AND ADDRESSES FOLLOWS. THEIR SIGHTINGS WERE QUITE SIMILAR IN NATURE BUT NOT FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED.
