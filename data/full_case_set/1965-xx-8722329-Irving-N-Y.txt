UFO SIGHTINGS

Mr. USAF RESERVE (Ret. Ring)

1. We have received a letter from Mrs. *****, who apparently resides in the vicinity of *****, Texas. According to her account, she and her family sighted a UFO on the evening of November 8, 1965. The duration of the observation should not exceed two to three minutes. 

As described, the object appeared to be high in the sky, and was a bright, steady light. It did not appear to move, or change color, or even disappear. It just seemed to hang there, without any visible means of propulsion. No sound was heard.

During the course of October, this planet VENUS was very bright, low in the southwestern sky, and could have been mistaken for a UFO by some observers. As the description given is rather meager, it is difficult to determine if this was indeed a UFO sighting, or simply a misidentification of a well-known celestial object.

3. ALL REPORTS, regardless of their apparent validity, are recorded in terms of man-made objects or of objects attributed to natural explanations. It is regrettable that the scope of this case precludes a more detailed investigation. However, without an actual sighting, or other tangible evidence, a definitive conclusion as to the identity of the object cannot be made at this time.

OCR output:

AS TO THE EXACT CAUSE. IN OVER 20,000 REPORTS OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTs NO ONE HAS BEEN HARMED BY THE OBJECT ITSELF. IT APPEARS THAT SOME REPORTS OF OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN FABRICATED OR EXAGGERATED EITHER INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY. REPORTS OF ENCOUNTERS UNDER UNUSUAL CONDITIONS OR CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT JUSTIFY ANY ALARM.

The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

near 11 miles and 1/2 from where I am now Siting the object move inclose to the ground about 300 to 400 feet and then move up again to about 1200 to 1500 feet in the air it moved around in diffrent directions and stay up there for about 10 to 15 minets and then just took off out of sight at a very high rate of speed I have seen lots of different objects in the sky but never one like this before it look like some kind of craft or something I dont know what it was but it sure wasent any plane or helicopter or anything like that I wach it close and I dont think it was any kind of mirage or anything like that it was real and what I saw I saw with my own eyes if you want me to go into more details let me know and I will try to describe it the best I can as I saw it.

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document page from a UFO report.

The full text of the document is as follows:

One can not relate minutiae of the event and remains after the incident, since I recounted the event as best I could without being overly long winded. My memory is not a photographic one and I tried to represent the event as I remembered it, necessarily omitting many details which might have been observed. The other two witnesses, [redacted] and [redacted], were not available for interview. Since this report is necessarily based on my own recollection the obvious limitations of such a source must be recognized. I hope the information provided is of use in your study of this case. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
