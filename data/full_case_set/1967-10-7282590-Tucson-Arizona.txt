1. In the basic letter, four questions were asked concerning the flying object and the enclosed photographs developed in reply to the four questions and may be helpful in your evaluation.

2. With reference to the first question concerning a feasible explanation for the cause of the impressions in the sand, the following paragraphs describe the limited laboratory study which provided relevant information.

Site Information
a. These Laboratories have on file numerous Corps of Engineers Condition Survey or Airfield Pavement Evaluation reports which describe details of soil and geological conditions, terrain, and drainage. Information in these reports primarily relates to the airfield, general observations of soil and climatic conditions apply to the location of the UFO observance.

b. The climate in the area is generally arid. Rainfall is the fall-months averages about 0.75 inches per month. Free ground water is rarely found at depths less than 200 feet.

c. The natural subgrade soils in the area consist mainly of sand (SC-SM), gravel (GP), and sandy clay (CL) in various proportions with an appreciable filling of lime carbonate. Sandy clays occur in many areas to depths of at least six feet, and existing materials, ranging from a loose to medium dense condition, are of common occurrence at depths varying from three to six feet.

d. The strength of these dry soils is in their natural uncompacted state. The modulus of subgrade reaction is on the order of 100 lbs per inch. This measure of soil strength is significant because of the way in which test values are obtained. The test procedure involves applying a static load to a 30-inch diameter plate and observing the indentation below the ground surface.

e. For convenience in discussion, the Air Force photographs have been assigned the arbitrary numbers A1 through A7.

f. Photographs A1 through A3 show how many footprints indicating sandy material is both dry and loose. The footprints near the impressions indicate a sinkage of about 1/2 inch which implies that material could be easily disturbed by shovelling. Static loading on a circular footing of approximately 22-inch diameter would include a bearing failure including a raised lip outside the footing. However, the cross section of the lip would show a rather sharply peaked shape.

g. Photographs A3 through A6 indicate areas immediately adjacent to the depressions that appear smooth. The smoothness is the result of the loose surface material by a flat board or the back of a shovel.

h. The shape of the raised lip (Photographs A2, A3, and A6) is sharply peaked. This sharp lip is not characteristic of soil failure due either to static surface loads or certain from high-velocity impact.

i. Photographs A2 through A6 reveal disturbances on the inside of the depressions which further rule out static loading. These disturbances are aligned along a diameter of the depressions.

each depression and consist of a ridge of material built up on the inside surface of each depression. The ridge is not uniform in height but is divided and curved as shown by photograph. The outside diameter of each depression appears to be less compacted than the ground surface of the immediate vicinity.

Simulation Tests:
1. In an effort to simulate the observed depressions, these Laboratories conducted a limited series of tests based on the hypothesis that some mechanism other than static or dynamic loading produced the unique appearance.
k. A standard sieve analysis completed on the material sent to us from the site revealed a sandy material similar in gradation to bank run sands present in the Chinidoro sand. This material is physically similar to the Arizona sand and was selected as a site for field testing.
1. The ridges in the left-hand depression of Photograph A6 appear to be the result of a rotational digging action. To test this hypothesis, simulation tests in the laboratory and in the field were accomplished and recorded on Photographs 01 through 07. Photographs 01 through 03 were taken in the laboratory using a simulating photograph taken at the nearby gravel pit.
m. The device used to make depressions in the laboratory was a steel pipe measuring 6" x 7" x 1/2". Photographs 01 and 02 show the pattern developed after standing the plate on the sand and rotating it clockwise, into the sand and at the start of each test. The raised lip with its sharp crest was caused by spillage around the leading edge of the plate and not by displacement. The ridge was formed by simply stopping.

the rotation and removing the plate vertically. However, the resultant ridge appeared too large in comparison with the Ar-sized depressions. Although 0.3 inches square of the ridge can be reduced while still retaining the sharp peaked torsional lip. This depression was started in the same way as the previous tests except that several handfuls were scooped from the bottom of the depression after which the steel plate was again rotated. The 0.7-inch edge of the plate was parallel to the ground surface during the rotation which was completed after the scooping operation.

n. Photographs 04 through 07 record the tests completed in the field under conditions shown. The photographs were recentered and printed directly form the film on the direct-positive principle. The main difficulty with these tests was the existing natural water content of the sand, which did not flow as readily as the dry sand tested in the laboratory and left marked striation along the sides of the depressions. We were unable to obtain photographs of the freshly made depressions because of malfunctioning of the equipment. Photographs 04, 05, and 07 show some breakdown in structure along the lip presenting the possibility of the start of a crater forming during the second visit to the gravel pit and shows the effect of moisture on the consolidation of a freshly-dug depression. All of these difficulties were discovered only after the tests were completed.

The bottoms of the depressions in each case contained loose material.

Summary - First Question

A. The shape and depth of the depressions rule out the possibility of either static or dynamic loading applied through 21-inch diameter footings.
B. The general appearance of the depressions can be duplicated by rotating a vertically oriented, flat plate in loose sand.

OFFICE-RP (9 November 1967)  
SUBJECT:  UFO Observation, 9 October 1967

1. With reference to the second question concerning the weight of the object, the strength of dry soils can be based on a static load test plate. The estimated modulus of subgrade reaction for the general area is about 100 psi per inch. If a weight-foot diameter is loaded, a material, approximately 500 psi would be required to produce the observed surface. The loading intensity and penetration depth corresponds to a total static load of about 30,000 pounds. Assuming that the vehicle weighed about 16,000 pounds, the total weight of the object would be about 460,000 pounds.

2. If the observed object was solid (assuming a 4-foot diameter and 8-foot high object), the resulting vehicle size (volume) would be still over nine times larger than the 4-foot diameter by 8-foot high object described.

3. The estimated modulus of subgrade reaction of about 100 psi per inch used above was the minimum found for the area in the site data. The soil sample furnished and assuming a low moisture content for the soil, based on the photographs, would indicate that the modulus of reaction would be in the range of 900 psi per inch. The higher the modulus the greater the compressive forces that the object would have to produce to leave the observed impressions. On this basis, the modulus should be considered, if necessary, for the modulus.

4. As described in paragraph 2m and 2n, the depressions made by a single individual whose height and weight are 5'8" and 160 pounds. This person required moderate effort to turn and embel the plate into the soil.

5. With reference to the third question of whether it would be feasible for a two-legged object of the shape described to make the depressions, the object described would inherently unless it contained some sort of stabilizing mechanism or was less penetrated deeply into the soil.

7. With reference to the fourth question of whether
it would be possible for a vehicle to make a deep depression
and leave a lip-like those in the photographs, the results
of the laboratory study provide some insight into ways the
depression can be duplicated. Based on required weight and
stability, it does not seem reasonable that a vehicle would
produce the depressions, such depressions, however, were reproduced with little difficulty by a single individual.

NARRATIVE:
On 7 October 1967, a private citizen photographed an unusual aerial phenomenon over Tucson, Arizona. The witness reported seeing a bright, circular object moving rapidly in the sky. 

The witness was able to take several photographs of the object before it disappeared from view. The photographs depict a distinct, circular object with a defined outline against the background sky.

Project Blue Book has analyzed the photographic evidence and determined that the object does not correspond to any known aircraft, weather phenomenon, or other identifiable aerial object. 

The case remains under investigation, and further analysis of the photographs is ongoing. No definitive conclusions have been reached regarding the nature or origin of the observed aerial phenomenon.

WITNESS STATEMENT

WITNESS: Robert H. Woodside, Captain
LOCATION: Tucson, Arizona
DATE: October 7, 1967

On the night of October 7, 1967, at approximately 8:00 PM, I was on duty as an air traffic controller at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona. While monitoring the radar screen, I observed an unidentified object displaying unusual flight characteristics. The object appeared to be larger than a conventional aircraft and was moving at a very high rate of speed. It made several sudden, erratic maneuvers that were not consistent with normal aircraft behavior. 

I immediately contacted the local authorities and the U.S. Air Force to report the sighting. A thorough investigation was conducted, but no definitive explanation for the object was ever determined. The incident was documented and filed as part of Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects.

I am submitting this witness statement as an accurate account of the events I observed on the night of October 7, 1967. I am willing to provide any additional information or clarification if needed.

SPECIAL REPORT
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO)

1. DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:
On 7 October 1967 at approximately 1815 hours, Mr. Mike Cosgrove, an employee of the Tucson Gas and Electric Company, observed an unidentified flying object over the northwest section of Tucson, Arizona. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
Mr. Cosgrove stated that the object appeared to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter, circular in shape, and bright silver in color. The object hovered for several minutes, then shot straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. No sound was heard during the observation.

2. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:
Mr. Cosgrove immediately reported his observation to the Tucson Gas and Electric Company dispatcher, who in turn notified the local Air Force Reserve unit at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. An investigation was initiated by the Air Force.

3. CONCLUSIONS:
Based on the information gathered, it is the conclusion of the investigating officer that the unidentified flying object observed by Mr. Cosgrove was most likely an advanced aircraft or experimental vehicle of some kind. The high rate of speed and abrupt vertical departure from the area are indicative of a highly capable and sophisticated aerial vehicle. However, the actual nature and origin of the object remain unknown.

SUBJECT: Letter of Appreciation
Upon our request, the Ohio River Division Laboratories provided pertinent information relating to a UFO incident during August 1967. It was necessary to obtain this information in order to prepare the draft report for a UFO investigator of the University of Arizona who also investigated the report and to track up our belief that the sighting was a hoax. The report is one of the most comprehensive scientific reports that has been presented to the Aerial Phenomena Office on a UFO sighting. For this reason, I feel that a letter of Appreciation should be sent to Mr. James McDonald, Chief of the Army Engineers Division, to express our thanks for a job well done.
