The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch shows a compass rose and instructions for drawing a picture to illustrate the motion and direction of an unidentified object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text.

The text on this page is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  4 May 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

This object that attitude-bearing and moving about made us realize this was not a star or aircraft of any kind that we were familiar with. And the fact that it could float motionless for a time and almost without any other shape or motion, seems only a little bit peculiar to military evaluations.

The image appears to contain a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. There is no photograph or image present in this particular page. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and transcribe all the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Faded out in the direction of northwestward sky.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes NO Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: ___________

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound None b. Color The colors - milky, white, haze

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? At arm's length it would probably cover completely

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
