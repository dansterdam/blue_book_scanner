PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: APR 22
2. LOCATION: DALLAS, TEXAS
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 1950-04-22/1920
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: 0 Ground-Radar
5. SOURCE: 0 Air-Visual
6. COURSE: Unknown
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 - 5 minutes
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
9. COURSE: Unknown direction
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Briefly, it was seen as a "fiery light," turn on and off, no definite formation.
11. COMMENTS: May have been probably say the pilot's sighting of some ordinary aircraft out there, the "fiery light" effect being probably due to his vision or the atmospheric conditions rather than indicating that it was anything extraordinary since it later was identified from the flight log that no aircraft was within the area.
