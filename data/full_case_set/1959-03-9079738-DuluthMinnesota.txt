The text in the report is as follows:

I. SOURCE: 1st Lt. Owen L. Schwatka, AD 3053631, USAF
Address: 11th CIS, DULUTH Municipal Airport, Minnesota
Area: 23
Occupation: Pilot, USAF
Education: High School Graduate, State of Maryland
Qualifications: Pilot, Instructor, USAF, DULUTH
Flying Time: Approximately 1,000 hours jet time, and 300 hours
conventional. 

III. SUBJECT'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 14 March 1959, at 0212 hours, 1st Lt. Owen L. Schwatka was airborne on a routine training mission in the vicinity of DULUTH, Minnesota. He was flying at an altitude of 5,000 feet when he observed two (2) lights to the north. These lights appeared to be about 10 miles distant and at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. The lights appeared to be rotating and changing colors, going from red to green to blue and then white. This cycle was repeated several times. The lights remained stationary for about 1 to 2 minutes and then accelerated and climbed at a 45 degree angle, reaching a speed which SCHWATKA estimated to be 1,000 to 1,500 mph. At the point of maximum speed, the lights appeared to be about the size of a dime and then simply disappeared from sight. The entire sighting lasted approximately 3 to 4 minutes.
SCHWATKA states that he is certain that the lights were not aircraft, satellites, astronomic bodies, or any other known object. He states that the lights were intelligently controlled and were capable of maneuvers and speeds far in excess of any known aircraft. SCHWATKA further states that he has discussed this sighting with other pilots and officers at the base and that they are of the opinion that the sighting was of an unidentified flying object.

SUBJECT: RED T CALLED GALARD and described the 14 object
  1. On Mar 7, 1956, at 2325 CST, subject observed a group of 14 objects moving in a N direction at a high rate of speed over Duluth, Minnesota. Subject first called them lights and then when they came closer, he could see they were red in color and shaped like a cigar. The objects made no sound and were at an estimated 2000 ft elevation. Subject observed the objects for about 2-3 minutes. 
  2. The subject stated that he took a 33 degree bearing and saw the objects maintain a steady course to the NNW. He stated that he was positive there were 14 objects in this UFO formation. He further stated that as the objects approached, they appeared to be rotating or oscillating and when they were overhead, the subject noticed that they appeared to be a bright red in color. The subject described the objects as being cigar-shaped and stated he could see no protrusions or wings. 
  3. The subject stated that he took several people outside, including his wife, to observe the UFO's. He stated that they all agreed with his observations and that he believes the objects were under intelligent control.
  4. The subject was advised to not discuss this incident with anyone other than proper authorities, and to report any further sightings immediately.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

USAF 715
This appears to be the south or southwest of the city, but I am not certain of the exact location. The object was estimated to be about 30 yards long, cigar-shaped, and was about 200 yards higher in altitude than the twin engine airplane that I saw. The object appeared to be moving at about 400 or 500 miles per hour, and I watched it for about 20 to 30 seconds. It disappeared into the distance at a high rate of speed.
This appears to be the description of the observed unidentified flying object. The document does not contain any other details or information beyond this textual description.

SOURCE: Captain Earl G. Weaver, 5212PA, USAF
Address: 1124 NE 14th St., Diluth Municipal Airport, Minnesota
Age: 34 D.O.B.: 5 September 1924
Occupation: Pilot, USAF
Education: High School Graduate - 1942
Qualifications: Cadet Flying School - 1942. 1st Reservation School - 1942. 1st Fighter School (P-51) - 1943. Hours flying time - 2900 hours.

II. RELIABILITY: Captain Weaver is considered a reliable and sincere observer. He has had over 2900 hours of flying time and is considered an above average intelligent officer. The information submitted agrees with previous information given.

III. SUMMARY: Captain Weaver, while on routine patrol at 11,000 feet in the vicinity of Diluth Municipal Airport, Minnesota (5:35 pm on 3 March 1959) sighted an unconventional aerial object. The object first appeared as a light in the sky, but as Captain Weaver closed within 2 miles, the light separated into two separate lights, one white and the other red. The white light suddenly accelerated and disappeared from his sight. The red light continued to maneuver in the air for approximately 30 seconds, then also accelerated and disappeared. The entire sighting lasted approximately 2-3 minutes. Captain Weaver stated that the object did not resemble any conventional aircraft and that he had never seen anything like it before. The pilot radioed the tower at Diluth but they reported no other aircraft in the area at the time. All information was submitted voluntarily.

SIGHTING REPORT 1-OD-32-59
CONCLUSIONS
An F-94 on night training flight near Duluth, Minnesota observed a bright light which appeared to be gaining altitude and moving away from the aircraft. The pilot accelerated but was unable to close on the object. He lost sight of the object as it disappeared. The unknown light was descried by the pilot as glowing with a constant intensity and as he ended the sighting, he decided that he could not make close on the unknown light.

COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICER:
1. The opinion of the reporting officer is that the unidentified visual sightings probably were the planets Venus.
2. On the basis of information, it is believed that the electronic sightings should be evaluated as "unknown" due to the absence of any reported instrumental data. They cannot be explained otherwise and should be considered as a possibility of unreported and unattended aircraft.

SIR:

The subject is an unusal circular shaped object sighted by me on 29 March 1959 near Duluth, Minnesota. The object was observed for approximately 4 minutes before it disappeared.

The subject was dark in color, appeared to be spinning, and was rapidly moving in an erratic manner. The object was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter.

The attached information sheet is submitted for your review. For your information, your office will be informed of any further developments.

FILE NO.		SUBJECT
IR DT-UFOB-2-59		FROM   AFOIH-LBI

Attached report (DT-UFOB-2-59) is principally concerned with visual sightings. Examination of this report indicates that the sightings reported by one F-102 pilot appear to be more like interference than an actual sighting. Apparently the pilot did not obtain the precise details necessary to identify the object. It is suggested that this report be evaluated on the basis of the visual sightings rather than the reported physical evidence.

The text found in the document is as follows:

DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO. SUBJECT UFO #D7-UFO-8-1-59
TO AFOIN-4Hqs FROM AFOIN-4H1 DATE 6 May 1959 COMMENT NO. 1
The following information is forwarded based on an analysis of UFO #D7-UFO-8-1-59.
1. It is difficult to accurately correlate the attached film with the report, without identification of the shape, orientation, range setting and time indication.
2. The reports of airborne contacts cannot be evaluated as actual airborne objects due to the insufficient data as the interceptor approached the radar target.
Since the AN/FPS-6, height finder, was unable to pick up the targets at such a close range (15-18 miles), it is believed that the phenomenon of "angels" could have been due to meteorological conditions rather than actual aircraft. Such indications of "angels" have been experienced before.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PROJECT 10073 RECORD
PART: 9 PAGE: 20

I. SUMMARY:
Subject: sighting of Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)
Date: 9 March 1959
Location: Duluth (GOODVIEW, MINN), Minnesota
Witness: Captain Joseph Murphy, 756th Acft Control Sq, USAF, Duluth (GOODVIEW, MINN), Minnesota
Age: 32, 29 June 1936
Occupation: Director of Radar (P-69 Radar Site) and Intelligence Officer at P-69
Education: Graduate student in Latin University in June 1958 (Chemical Engineering, also studied Astronomy). GCI course at Tyndall AFB.

II. RELIABILITY:
Was interrogated for six (6) months at P-69 radar site. Considered to be a reliable and competent observer. The entire interview was taped and a copy of the tape has been forwarded to Project 10073 file. He has been in the service for over four years.

III. DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:
At approx 2050, 9 March 1959, Captain Joseph Murphy observed a single, bright, motionless light at approximately 10,000 ft, west-southwest of the P-69 radar site. The light was observed to be stationary for about 45 minutes, then it suddenly accelerated at an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared from sight in about 2 to 3 seconds. The object was estimated to be traveling at a speed of over 1200 mph during its departure. It did not leave a trail. The object was tracked on the P-69 radar scope and the speed calculation was confirmed. No sound was heard. The night was clear with unlimited visibility. The object was observed by Captain Murphy through binoculars for the entire period of the sighting. A few other personnel at the site also observed the object, though the number is not specified.

AF FORM 112--PART II 
APPROVED I JUNE 1949
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Detachment 7, 1006th AISS 
Selfridge AFB, Mich. 

SUBJECT:   DY-UFO-3-59   PART 2:79 
DATE:  20  MARCH 1959  

1. On 3 March 1959, ARTHUR GODFREY, from Duluth, Minnesota, called the 1006th AISS on a report he had received from a civilian pilot.

2. The pilot, (BLANK), stated that on 25 February 1959, at approximately 1805 CST, he was flying a single-engine aircraft at 7,000 feet over Duluth, Minnesota. The weather was clear with visibility unlimited. At that time, he observed a bright, disclike object which appeared to be hovering in the air at his altitude. He first observed the object at a distance of approximately five (5) miles to the west of his position. As he approached the object, it appeared to glow bright orange in color. The pilot stated that he had a good look at the object and that it seemed to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. He further stated that the object appeared to have a row of "portholes" or lighted areas around its perimeter. The object was motionless, except for a slight oscillating or rocking motion. After observing the object for approximately four (4) minutes and then lost contact. 

3. The pilot further stated that when he first observed the object, his aircraft instruments began to fluctuate, the compass going completely wild. Approximately one (1) minute after he lost sight of the object, his instruments returned to normal.

4. The pilot stated that he tried to contact the object by radio on both the tower frequency and the emergency frequency, but received no response.

5. The controller called CHARLES GLISS at (BLANK) to advise him of the sighting and to obtain any additional details he could provide. GLISS stated that he was aware of the incident and that he had a good visual observation of the object. GLISS stated that the object was illuminated and gave off a reddish-orange glow. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was estimated to be approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter. GLISS further stated that the object was observed to be motionless, except for a slight oscillating or rocking motion. GLISS stated that he was unable to determine any details of the object's construction, but that it appeared to have some type of portholes or lighted areas around its perimeter.

6. The T-33 controller stated that the probable order was as follows:
a. Rendezvous on (1) - 50 bird (C-130A)
b. Master angle 20
c. Center CAUTIO on ten (10) when airborne

7. The T-33 controller stated that GODFREY had a (C-130A) of the 11th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, which reported that the object hovered at 10,000 feet for approximately 20 minutes before slowly moving off to the southeast at a high rate of speed.

8. The sighting was reported to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, as required.

PT. 1: Here controller vectored RED I on a 030 degree heading at 7000 knots.
PT. 2: RED I at 25,000 feet had a contact on his scope 25 degrees to the right from his position. He had intermittent contacts for about 15 seconds.
PT. 3: Here controller vectored RED I to the left on a about a 320 degree heading at a high rate of speed. Red I lost contact after approximately one (1) minute. 
PT. 4: Here RED I had contact on his scope 90 degrees to his port side. At 17 miles, RED I maneuvered AF chloroform designed on his target which was on a northerly heading on his port side.
PT. 5: Here controller had RED I join the formation, which had seven (7) unknown objects in a "V" formation, heading 320 knots ground speed, at 250 knots air speed.
PT. 6: Controller then vectored RED I to the left on a heading of 300 degrees.

The sighting of an unidentified object was reported by the controller and said he had contact 50 degrees to his left at 10 miles. RDD it's contact faded. Controller was unable to say how long RDD it.

Pp. 9: Controller stated had it to a 329 degree heading.
Pp. 10: When the object was in sight the controller vectored RDD it on a star course and it went in direction of Ely, Minnesota. Controller vectored RDD it a star course on approximately 279 degrees heading and said had it on scope for approximately 3 minutes. The controller stated that RDD it flew through an unknown exhaust, and the pilot was unable to describe. Controller then vectored RDD it to his home base.

Pp. 12: More data: Pilot pick up on GPA-23 scope at F-89.

IV: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Shortly after vectoring RDD it back to base, F-89 controller called ADDC for further information. ADDC advised that USAF technical information sheet ATIC Form 322 (classified data 1952) indicated nothing of significance. POISON answered that they photographed RDD it's mission.

REF UFO SIGHTING OVER DULUTH, MINN AREA ON 14 MAR 59. THE FOLLOWING IS OUR ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS OF THIS INCIDENT. THE RADAR READINGS WERE MORE LIKELY DUE TO INTERFERENCES, PROBABLY FROM THE EXCESSIVE ACTIVITY OF AURORA BOREALIS, RATHER THAN AN ACTUAL PAINT. THE OBJECT SEEN VISUALLY WAS PROBABLY THE PLANET VENUS WHICH WAS A FEW DEGREES BELOW THE HORIZON AT A MAGNETIC BEARING OF APPROX 300 DEGREES. AND REFRACTION COULD BRING THE PLANET INTO VIEW AND DIFFRACTION AND DISTORTION BY THE ALTERNATE LAYERS OF AIR OF DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES COULD CAUSE THE EFFECTS OF MOVEMENT AND CHANGE OF COLOR AND SHAPE. THE FACT THAT THIS OBJECT MAINTAINED ITS SAME RELATIVE POSITION, AND THAT THE F-102'S WERE UNABLE TO CLOSE ON IT, LENDS CREDENCE TO THIS CONCLUSION.

Where was CADO case 907 dated 1-12-57 which indicated a satellite 'with the body and tail of one of the Russian Sputniks of 1957' and with a long trailing 'flame' had been observed by a radar operator at Goose Bay Labrador at 0305Z on 1-11-57? This observation was made upon the same night, at the same place, by the same radar operator and the description of the object is almost identical with the 'Sputnik' case. On that night the 'Sputnik' had been observed for a period of 30 minutes, with the tail glowing brightly. What observations, if any, were made of this second satellite or probe by the Airforce in this area, and what was the explanation, if any, given by the authorities? The satellite or probe moved rapidly in the same general direction as the 'Sputnik' of the previous night, and was under observation by the radar operator for approximately 5 minutes, and was confirmed by visual observation."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: (Name/Address) Lt. Looen Atae 
Duluth, Minnesota  
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting near Duluth, Minnesota on 22 Dec 58
I. SOURCE: 1/Lt James R. Ryans, A/C 17455331, USAF
Address: 75dth ACAW Squadron, K.I. SAC (ATC 4545), Minnesota  
Date: 29 Dec 58
Occupation: Intercept Control Technician (ICT) at K-63 radar site
Education: High school graduate - radar operator's course, Keesler AFB
II. SYNOPSIS: On the night of 12 March 1959 (2300) subject sighted an unidentified aerial object from his radar site near Duluth, Minnesota. The object was tracked on radar and visually observed for approximately 15 minutes. It displayed characteristics of an aircraft, but was unable to give complete data on its speed, altitude and direction of flight due to interruption of radar contact. The object subsequently disappeared from radar.
III. DETAILS: On 12 March 1959 at approximately 2330 hours, Lt. James R. Ryans, A/C 17455331, of the 756th ACAW Squadron, K.I. LAND (GCI 4555), Minnesota, was on duty as an Intercept Control Technician (ICT) at the K-63 radar site. While performing his normal duties, he observed on the radar scope an unidentified object traveling at an estimated speed of 1100-1500 knots at an altitude of approximately 38,000 feet. The object was observed on radar for about 15 minutes and was also visually observed during this period. It was described as glowing white in color, about the size of a large aircraft, and traveling in a straight and level course. During the time it was tracked by radar, the object made several abrupt turns and altitude changes, which were noted on the radar screen. Although the object displayed characteristics similar to those of a jet aircraft, Lt. Ryans was unable to obtain positive identification or give complete data on its speed, altitude, and direction of flight due to interruption of radar contact. The object subsequently disappeared from radar.
Lt. Ryans stated that the object was definitely not a meteor, balloon, or any other known type of aircraft. He had several years of experience as a radar operator and was thoroughly familiar with the normal indications of various types of aircraft on the radar scope. He is convinced that the object observed was of an unidentified nature.

AF FORM 112--PART II
HEADQUARTERS I USAF
SUBJECT: 'Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object 
Duluth, Minnesota, 19 March 1959 
REFERENCE: D7-0033-1-59

CLASSIFICATION: nONFIDANTIAL

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. GENERAL: A pilot of the Lake Superior Air Defense Sector, 4707th Air Defense Wing, Duluth, Minnesota, sighted an unidentified aerial object on 19 March 1959 at approximately 1800 hours (6:00 PM). The pilot was conducting a routine training flight in a F-102A jet interceptor aircraft and was flying at an altitude of approximately 11,000 feet when the sighting occurred. 

2. DETAILS: The pilot, a First Lieutenant, stated that he first observed the object at a range of approximately 10 miles. At this range the object appeared to be approximately 1/4 the size of the full moon. The object was oval in shape and had a distinct color which the pilot described as "white-silver". No exhaust or propulsion system was visible. The object appeared to be motionless, although the pilot could not determine if it was hovering or not. After observing the object for approximately 30 seconds, the pilot attempted to close in on it. As he did so, the object appeared to accelerate and rapidly pull away, disappearing from sight in a north-easterly direction. The pilot estimated the speed of the object to be several times faster than his own aircraft which was traveling at approximately 500 knots. The pilot stated that he had a clear, unobstructed view of the object throughout the sighting and that the object gave off no reflections or light. The object did not appear to leave any trail or vapor in its wake.

3. CONCLUSION: According to the pilot, this was the first time he had ever observed an unidentified aerial object. He stated that in his opinion there was an "airborne object there" which did not conform to any known aircraft. The Technical Information Sheet is attached.

AF FORM 112â€”PART II
DOCUMENT NO. D7-U203-1-59

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

I. SOURCE: 2nd Lt. James D. Chapman, AO 3654207, AND
Address: 1726B 3rd (SAC) FLIGHT MAINTENANCE SQ, DULUTH MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, MINNESOTA
Age: 25 D.O.B: 1 August 1933
Occupation: Security Police, Northern City Police Dept. prior to entering military service
Education: High School Graduate, June 1951. Graduated LACKLAND
AIR BASE BASIC TRAINING, JUNE 1956.
Qualifications: Approximately 600 flying hours; 500 hours jet.

II. SUMMARY: On 23 March 1959, at approximately 0800 CST, the witness (Lt. Chapman) was proceeding in a security patrol car on the north perimeter road of the Duluth Municipal Airport. He observed three bright, shiny silver-colored, round or disc-shaped objects hovering and maneuvering in the air over the airport. The objects were approximately 1,000 to 1,500 feet above the ground and about 1/2 mile southwest of the witness' position. The objects were completely silent, with no visible means of propulsion. Lt. Chapman stated that Lt. Colonel GALLAHAN, the 148th Fighter Interceptor Squadron Commander, also observed these objects.

III. DETAILS: The three objects first appeared in sight at approximately 0800 CST, March 23, 1959. Lt. Chapman estimated their size as approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. The objects hovered and maneuvered silently for about 10-15 minutes, then accelerated rapidly and climbed out of sight at an estimated altitude of 25,000 feet. No exhaust or contrails were visible. The objects were observed to be silver-colored and round or disc-shaped. Two of the objects flew in tight, circular maneuvers, while the third object remained stationary.

Upon completion of his patrol, Lt. Chapman immediately reported his sighting to Lt. Colonel GALLAHAN. Lt. Colonel GALLAHAN stated that he had also observed the objects from the control tower and had called the radar station in an attempt to get a radar fix on the targets. However, the radar could not pick up the unidentified objects.

The two (2) targets that performed the circular maneuvers were lost after approximately 10 minutes, while the third stationary object remained in sight for a total of 15 minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

The practice of intercepting unidentified aerial objects was discussed, and GALLAHAN stated that to take a photo of such objects, a 35MM camera would have to be on constant alert at the control tower, and that the pilots were not equipped to get close enough to take a photo. GALLAHAN expressed the opinion that the objects were not aircraft, but were unidentified flying objects.

REPORT NO. 77-U-35-1-59

PART I: UFO SIGHTING
Incident 7, 1956th AISS - Date and Time of Sighting: 10 March 1956 - 6:15 pm 
Location: Duluth, Minnesota - Distance from Observer: Approximately 8-9 miles, but nothing beyond.

This unidentified sip, however, was oval in shape and had a definite metallic sheen. As he described it, its size was approximately 30 feet in diameter. He stated that it appeared to be hovering at an elevation of 500-600 feet above the ground. He observed it for approximately 8 minutes before it rapidly accelerated to an estimated speed of approximately 1,500 mph and disappeared from sight.

The observation was briefly interrupted when the observer was called to the telephone. When he returned outside, the object was still in view, hovering at the same approximate elevation. He was able to observe it further for about 2 to 3,000 feet altitude.

The pilot of an aircraft observed a light below his aircraft at approximately 6:30 pm, in the same general area as the reported sighting. There was no radar contact established and no other witnesses could be located. No further information.

Dining car in night train received message and Conductor contacted me and said a missile was sighted over Lake Superior and to be alert. Looked out of train window and saw a light in sky followed by what appeared to be a missile coming from south high-speed and gaining altitude. Had a solid trail like a vapor trail. I watched it for about 15 seconds until it disappeared from sight. I called the attention of other train passengers to it and they agreed it was a missile. I don't know if that's the case or not, but it was definitely something that appeared and behaved like a missile.

III. DETAILS OF SIGHTING: The witness stated that on 13 January 1959, at approximately 0930 hours, he was flying a small private aircraft (Aeronca Defender II) on a routine check flight from the Duluth Municipal Airport when he observed an unidentified object about 10 miles north of Duluth. According to the witness, the object appeared from the north, flew past the aircraft, and continued south at a very high rate of speed. The witness estimated the speed of the object to be approximately 1500 mph. The witness stated that the object was in sight approximately 15-20 seconds and disappeared from view to the south. The witness described the object as disc-shaped, silver in color, and approximately 50-60 feet in diameter. The witness stated that the object appeared to be tumbling or rotating as it passed by the aircraft. The witness further stated that he had no idea of the altitude of the object, but that it was definitely below the altitude of his aircraft, which was approximately 2500 feet. The witness stated that the object made no sound and left no exhaust trail. The witness stated that at the time of the sighting, the sky was clear and the visibility was excellent.

The witness further stated that approximately 1 hour after the sighting, he landed the aircraft and immediately reported the incident to the Duluth Municipal Airport Control Tower. The witness stated that he was convinced that what he saw was not an aircraft of any known type and that it was unlike anything he had ever seen before. The witness stated that he was very impressed and concerned about what he had observed.

Qualifications: 1950: 142 hours Angling toward training in radar and jet aircraft. Graduate Radar Observer, Perrin AFB. Texas, 1952. Rated as Navigator/Observer, USAF.

II. RELIABILITY: All information was voluntarily submitted. Source was very cooperative and frank. Reliability and trustworthy by his fellow officers, as a Radar Observer. He was absolutely normal and healthy.

III. DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 13 March 1952, between 1600 and 1800 CST, Source noticed several bright white objects moving rapidly across the sky at a high altitude. The objects appeared without warning, maneuvered erratically, and disappeared in much the same manner. No trail or exhaust was visible. At no time was the peculiar movement of the objects identifiable as that of conventional aircraft. They appeared to be completely silent. The objects were estimated to be approximately 6-12 miles distant, and to be about 40,000 feet in altitude. The source attempted to track the objects with the radar equipment in his aircraft, but was unable to obtain a radar return. During the sighting, the source was operating an F-94 jet aircraft. Weather conditions were clear. Objects were observed for approximately 3 minutes.

IN SIZE RAPIDLY, SEEMED TO BE DIRECTLY ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH US. I
WAS TRYING TO LOCK ON THE TARGET AIRCRAFT, WHICH WAS TRAVELING IN
DIRECTION CONTRARY TO OUR OWN, CLOSING RAPIDLY. AS WE NEARED THE OBJECT,
IT APPEARED TO SLOW DOWN UNTIL IT CAME TO COMPLETE STOP ABOUT 300 YDS. FROM
OUR AIRCRAFT. THE OBJECT WAS MAKING A DEFINITE GLOW AND APPEARED TO BE ROUND
OR DISC-SHAPED. THE COLOR WAS A BRILLIANT WHITE-ORANGE. OBJECT REMAINED
STATIONARY FOR ABOUT TWO (2) MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME THE RADAR OBSERVER
IN OUR AIRCRAFT WAS UNABLE TO PICK UP ANY RETURN. ALTHOUGH THE OBJECT WAS IN
FULL VIEW OF BOTH PILOTS, THE RADAR OPERATOR COULD NOT DETECT IT.
AFTER REMAINING STATIONARY FOR ABOUT TWO (2) MINUTES, THE OBJECT ACCELERATED
TO A FANTASTIC SPEED AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE DISTANCE, LEAVING ONLY A
BRIGHT TRAIL OF LIGHT. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO ACCELERATE SO RAPIDLY THAT
IT SEEMED TO EXTEND INTO A STRAIGHT LINE OF LIGHT WHEN OBSERVED.

1. DETAILS OF OBSERVATION: Lt. Tony A. Cox, Jr., AC 30713, USA
Address: 11th FIS, DULUTH MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, MINNESOTA
Age: 25 Ht: 5 ft 11 in, Wt: 175
Occupation: Pilot, USAF (31-1030A)

EDUCATION: Graduate High School, Trussville, Alabama, 1950;
Graduate University of Alabama (BA-Physics) and
Chemistry) 1954.

QUALIFICATIONS: Pilot, Flight Training, 6 months, 4 January 1957; Mainstream Air Base, Georgia, Single Jet Transition, 6 months, April 1957; Instrument Pilot Training 3 months, July 1957, Greenville, South Carolina. Overall total flying hours: 900.

II. RELIABILITY: Lt. Cox, Jr. was extremely cooperative, friendly and conscientious in his handling of this interview. All information was voluntarily submitted. Lt. Cox's description was very detailed and thorough. He instinctively felt that the sighting was important enough to report.

III. DETAILS OF SIGHTING: On 13 March 1959 at 0135Z, 1st Lt. Tony A. Cox, Jr., AC 30713, USA was piloting a T-33 jet aircraft (Ser. No. 52-9502) in an S-1025 designated training mission over Lake Superior, approximately 20 miles northeast of Duluth, Minnesota. The object was first sighted at a distance of approximately 10 miles and was observed for about 2-3 minutes. It appeared to be about the size of a T-33 aircraft and was luminous (whitish-yellowish glow). It seemed to be stationary and hovering, maintaining an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet. Lt. Cox conducted a series of maneuvers to get a better look at the object, which appeared to respond by making similar maneuvers. He noted that the object seemed to accelerate rapidly when it moved, and that its speed was greatly in excess of the T-33's capability. At one point, the object appeared to divide into two parts, which then rejoined. Lt. Cox felt that the bodiess were nearly spherical in shape. The flight was terminated at approximately 0215Z, and Lt. Cox immediately reported the sighting to the control tower. He stated that the bodies were very obscure (like a pilot's silhouette was well acquainted with this type of flight). There was no sound associated with the object, and it displayed no visible means of propulsion.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 9 March 1959 at 0840Z, 1st Lt. Tony A. Cox, Jr., Pilot, 11th FIS, Duluth Municipal Airport, Minnesota, observed a bright seemingly metallic object, in the Westerly direction at an altitude of approximately 20,000 ft. The object was reddish-orange in color and changed to a bright white luminosity. It appeared to be approximately three times the size of a B-29 Bomber and remained stationary. Lt. Cox called this sighting to the attention of other pilots in the flight. He maneuvered his aircraft in an attempt to close in on the object but the object then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. This incident lasted approximately 1 minute. The object was observed again at 0900Z when the flight returned to base. Attempts to contact the object by radio on UHF and VHF were made but no positive results.

NAME  Chester A. Lowe
ADDRESS  3602 Edgewater Drive, Duluth, Minnesota
WITNESS STATEMENT  On March 13, 1959 at 5:40 p.m. I observed an unidentified flying object in the sky. The object was approximately 1 mile west of the Bong Bridge, Duluth, Minnesota. It was moving in a southeasterly direction at a high rate of speed. It appeared to be round or oval in shape and about the size of a car. It had no wings, fins, or visible propulsion system. The object was traveling on a level course and was observed for a period of 8-10 seconds. There was no sound associated with the object. The weather conditions were clear and visibility was excellent. I am a licensed pilot with over 600 hours of flight time and this is the first time I have observed an unidentified flying object.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

In the opinion of the preparing officer, there were a number of radar contacts made during the period of time which may or may not be related to each other.

On the basis of the obtained information, it is believed that these electronic signities show a relationship to the reported sightings, but do not necessarily account for the presence of any unidentified flying objects which might have been observed.

There is a remote possibility that the radar siguals may in the minds of the observers have been mistaken for the brightly illuminated objects that were reported. This factor cannot, however, account for all of the electronic sightings. 

Certain during the period of time a number of aircraft were operating in the area, including unreported Air Force operations in the area at the time.

Regarding visual sightings of contrails in the sighting area, these signities may have been contrails from aircraft, but liquid reported that several aircraft were producing contrails (the liquid reported that aircraft were producing contrails).

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document can be transcribed as follows:

Tail light 30 degrees on each side. The lights also cover approximately 60 degrees in azimuth. The lights will be such that the Beacon Lighting Company indicated that same lighting equipment as used on a T-33 and that the Federal Aviation Agency had no restrictions on a T-33 aircraft. The lights will be operated by a 6-9.0v battery and will flash at a rate of roughly 30 flashes per minute.

2. Fire Control System installed in the F-102A is the MA-1 Fire Control System. This system has a maximum range of 20 miles and a maximum altitude of 60,000 feet, under ideal conditions.

3. Unusual objects activity in the area at the time of the sightings.

4. Shape, color, size and other characteristics of object as reported.

5. Position of major stars and prominent planets at time of sightings.

D. Analysis
1. ACRIN-HEL concludes that in all probability the radar readings were due to interference and not the actual sightings. The sightings were probably due to a ballooning effect caused by the combination of very cold temperature (28 degrees from MARCH-1958 to APRIL-1959) from APRIL-1958 to MARCH-1959 as the planet Venus was a few degrees below the horizon at a magnetic bearing of approximately 290 degrees. Refraction could have caused the planet Venus and its illumination to be distorted in various shapes, colors and apparent motions.

E. Conclusions
1. The radar readings were due to interference and not the actual sightings, and those interference phenomena were probably due to excessive activity of the northern lights (aurora).
2. The sightings were actually induced by the crews of the aircraft, probably the planet Venus, brought into view by diffraction and distorted by the alternate layers of warm and cold air. The planet's color and shape maintained the same relative position, and that this object's motion maintained its same relative position, and this object's relationship to the aircraft was considered by the Investigating Officer to be normal, with no substantive basis for unusual conclusions.

Would you say it was shiny or dull in appearance? About how large would you estimate the object to be, in comparison with known objects? AS SIGHTED AT NIGHT SO IT APPEARED STATIONARY AGAINST A DARK AIR BACKGROUND. HAVING A FLUORESCENT REDDISH ORANGR LIGHT. PASSED JUST IN FRONT OF THE BEACON. 

42. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this? (Circle one) Yes No If you answered no, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?

43. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it? IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A PLANET. NO WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE RED GREEN LIGHTS.

UFO SIGHTING, DULUTH, MINNESOTA
13 MARCH 1959

On 13 March 1959, at 0930, and on 14 March 1959, at 0930, an unidentified flying object was sighted from the Duluth, Minnesota airport. The object was reported to have been observed both visually and on radar by military personnel. The object was described as circular in shape and seemed to hover at times, then move at a very high rate of speed.
The object was reported as tubular or round. Only one "object" was reported. It was observed that the object seemed to have lights on it and that it appeared to be of a magnetic force nature.
Two of the airborne witnesses were pilots of F-102 interceptors. These pilots were attempting to intercept the object but were unable to close on the object.
The radar targets were reported to have been both sharp and fuzzy contacts. During the sightings the object frequently appeared and disappeared as tracked by the radar observers. The object was reported to have flown in many different directions at high speeds too fast for aircraft.
The object was observed that the object seemed to be several hundred yards in diameter. The radar observer reported that the object changed size and shape during the sighting.
Radar film from the ground stations was forwarded to ATIC and analyzed as a different location.
The sighting period, for both the radar and visual sighting, was reported to have lasted 30 minute periods.
The weather during the period was reported as clear, visibility 15+, and wind from 10-15 knots.
The visual sightings corresponded to the location indicated by the radar sightings of the object.
The position of the planet Venus, as to the identification of the planet Venus, reported for the UFO. The lighting conditions at the time of the sighting coincided with the lighting conditions of the planet Venus, contributing factor.

Dr. Gerald H. Haines

Bedford, Massachusetts

Dear Dr. Haines:

Here are two more unusual sightings from the ATIC file. These incidents, while not established as being of an extraterrestrial nature, are nevertheless of significant interest and will be forwarded for your information. 

1. The ATIC file does not contain any information on the sighting reported to us by Mrs. Mildred H. Glover of 523 East Boulevard, Duluth, Minnesota. 

2. Sorry to have taken so long, but we are in limited operation and are just now getting to these reports.

I am glad to hear of the progress which you and your staff are making in the study of these cases. It continues to amaze me that so little has been done publicly regarding the factual data that has been collected. However, I realize the complexities and difficulties involved in handling these sightings.

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

Sincerely,

EDWARD J. RUPPELT
Chairman, USAF Scientific - Technical

The image does not contain a photograph. It is a typed document describing an observation of what was believed to be the planet Venus as an "unidentified flying object" on March 12, 1959 in Duluth, Minnesota.

Venus as an Evening "Star"
In the evening of 1959 Venus again, this time in the evening, caused reports of flying saucers. As close as 15 miles, an unidentified flying object with visibility of over fifteen miles, was observed. Witnesses described its shape as tubular or cigar-shaped, grey in color, and with a rotary or spinning motion. Two interceptions by the Air Defense Command were made, but they could get no closer and eventually gave up the chase. It was observed for about thirty minutes, by fading from sight. Airborne radar tracked the object intermittently as it made various sweeps and, at times, heading toward the position of the observers and then racing away, all with irregular speeds, but they could not make a positive identification of the aircraft. At the same time, about thirty minutes, the ground station had photographed and the film showed the object at Boston, Mass. and its size on the film indicated it to be a large object.
The radar screen at the ground station had been photographed and the film showed that the object was not from a real target but were "angels" that the observers had noticed (see Chapter VI). Some operators reported the object made sharp contacts, others reported the object faded intermittently. Apparently, as others it moved off the scope at incredible speeds.
At the first of the sighting Venus was just on the western horizon, and probably was the true position occupied by the unknown, and probably would have been mistaken for the reflection by the earth's atmosphere had produced layers of light and dark alternating. The object had maneuverability.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract and output all the text found in the document:

On the evening of March 9, 1959, at approximately 6:30 p.m. CST, this office was notified by the Duluth, Minnesota Police Department that a local resident had reported the sighting of an unidentified aerial object. The resident, a Mr. John Doe, called the police to report that he had observed an object moving rapidly across the sky from north to south. The object was described as being bright in appearance, larger than a star, and moving at a high rate of speed. Mr. Doe further stated that the object appeared to change direction abruptly and then accelerate to a very high speed, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds.

Upon receipt of this information, this office contacted the Duluth Police Department and requested that they obtain a detailed statement from Mr. Doe regarding his observation. A member of this office was dispatched to the Duluth area to conduct a personal interview with Mr. Doe and to gather any additional information or evidence that might be available.

The interview with Mr. Doe revealed the following additional details:
1. Mr. Doe was standing on the front porch of his residence when he observed the object.
2. The object was observed for approximately 10-15 seconds before it disappeared from view.
3. Mr. Doe stated that the object appeared to be metallic in nature and was emitting a bright, white light.
4. No sound was associated with the object's movement.
5. Mr. Doe was unable to estimate the altitude or size of the object, but stated that it appeared to be much larger than a conventional aircraft.

No other witnesses to this sighting have been identified at this time. A thorough search of the area was conducted by local law enforcement, but no physical evidence or debris was located.

This office will continue to investigate this reported sighting and will provide any additional information or findings as they become available.

OCR Output:
THE REPORT I SUBMITTED HERE CONTAINS A NEW PIECE OF INFORMATION WHICH I FEEL HAS SOME SIGNIFICANCE. LAST EVENING, MARCH 6, 1959, ABOUT 8:00 P.M., I OBSERVED AN UNUSUAL LIGHT IN THE SKY WHICH I CANNOT READILY EXPLAIN. THE OBJECT WAS FIRST SIGHTED IN THE NORTH, APPROXIMATELY 40-45 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. IT APPEARED TO BE A VERY BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO BE STATIONARY. AS I WATCHED IT, HOWEVER, IT BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY TOWARD THE WEST. IT CONTINUED THIS WESTWARD MOVEMENT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, THEN ABRUPTLY CHANGED DIRECTION AND HEADED NORTH. IT CONTINUED THIS NORTHWARD MOVEMENT FOR PERHAPS A MINUTE OR TWO, THEN ABRUPTLY TURNED AND SPED AWAY TO THE NORTHEAST AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED, DISAPPEARING FROM SIGHT IN A FEW SECONDS. DURING THE TIME I OBSERVED THE OBJECT, IT APPEARED TO CHANGE DIRECTION ABRUPTLY ON AT LEAST THREE OCCASIONS. WHILE MOVING, IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE BLINKING OR PULSATING IN ANY WAY. IT SIMPLY CHANGED DIRECTION IN A VERY RAPID, ABRUPT MANNER WHICH I FOUND QUITE UNUSUAL. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER OBSERVED ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN THE SKY, AND I CAN OFFER NO EXPLANATION FOR WHAT I SAW. I AM A SOMEWHAT EXPERIENCED OBSERVER OF THE NIGHT SKY, AND I AM QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THE APPEARANCE OF CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, SATELLITES, AND ASTRONOMICAL OBJECTS. WHATEVER I SAW LAST NIGHT DID NOT CONFORM TO MY KNOWLEDGE OF ANY OF THESE FAMILIAR OBJECTS. I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE IN THE DULUTH AREA OBSERVED A SIMILAR OBJECT LAST EVENING. IF SO, I WOULD APPRECIATE LEARNING OF THEIR OBSERVATIONS AND ANY CONCLUSIONS THEY MAY HAVE REACHED AS TO THE NATURE OF THE OBJECT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS REPORT.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an 'A' marked on it, indicating how high the object was above the horizon. The second sketch shows a larger landscape view with an 'A' and a 'B' marked, presumably representing different positions of the observed object.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The text in the document is as follows:

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
ORIGINATING AGENCY: DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE, HQ USAF, WASHINGTON 25, D.C.
REPORT NO.: D-U-S-2-59
DATE: JUN 17, 1959
PAGE: 5 OF 13 PAGES

I. SOURCE: MAS James E. Pyanke, AF 17449991, USAF
Address: 7325th ACWH SQUADRON, ELLISON AFB (City AFB 49239), Minnesota
Age: PO JOHN 27 DECEMBER 1928
Occupation: Telephone Control Technician (C&W SCFG-69 RADAR)
Education: M.S. School Graduate - Radar Operator's Course, Missouri School of Mines, Rolla, Missouri

Qualifications: Radar Operator (AFSC 57335) from April 1957

II. THE DETAILS: The source was very friendly, cooperative, and sincere during the interview. He described the incident which occurred on 23 April 1959 (0340) as follows: On the evening in question he was on duty at the radar control station at Duluth AFB, Minnesota. At approximately 0340 hours he was observing the radar scope when he noticed a very fast moving, unidentified target in the vicinity of the Duluth area. He immediately notified the controller on duty, who in turn reported it to the Captain of the Guard. The Captain and Controller observed the target on the scope for a period of approximately 35-40 seconds. The target was observed to be traveling at an estimated speed of 1700-1800 mph and made a sharp turn of approximately 40-45 degrees. The target then slowed and hovered for a period of about 15 seconds at an altitude estimated to be 18-20,000 feet. The target then accelerated and traveled a distance of approximately 8-10 miles in about 2-3 seconds, and was lost from the radar scope. Source states that he has logged hundreds of hours on the radar equipment and has never observed any known aircraft capable of the maneuvers described. He stated that the target appeared as a very bright, solid return and that no interference or malfunction of the equipment was noted during the time of the sighting. The Captain of the Guard and Controller corroborated the source's statement.
