1. I apologize for the delay in replying to your request during our telephone conversation in April. I was finally able to contact him on leave. I received his account of the incidents in question.

2. While he was on a mission during the evening of 8 November 1967, Captain Randall L. Teeuwen, the aircraft commander, sighted an unidentified light source at approximately 11:30 p.m. This light source moved and was observed within a five mile radius and was moving at a high rate of speed. The light appeared to be reddish-orange in color and luminous. There were no aircraft or other identifiable objects in the area at the time.

3. Major Vanenvenhoven mentioned the sightings to Chicago Center but did not report the sightings to Offutt Air Force Base. A copy of his report is not available for your file. Unfortunately, any other information concerning this incident is not available to command.

4. I realize that this information is very sketchy. Unfortunately, it is the only information that Major Vanenvenhoven could provide. Additional information revealed during this report will not be of any assistance to you.

UFO Observation, 8 November 1967

Basic Operations: 
USAF ADJ THORENSEN 5313

1. Reference telephone conversation between Captain Roy Cunningham, ADC Computer Division, and Lt Col Quintanilla, this office, on 9 Apr 1963. At that time, it was decided that the University of Colorado Air Force research report on UFO investigations would be made available as an ancillary to the results of the Colorado CUP Report. The foregoing is a supplement to the review of that USAF sponsored research on the UFO object (UTO) report of 4 November 1967.

2. The details of this farther investigation will be made available to this office by Dr. Condon of the University of Colorado and to this office.  

3. To date, the details of this investigation have not been received. However, as soon as this information is received, it will be forwarded to the University of Colorado and to this office.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
5 April 1968
Major Quintanilla spoke with Captain Cunningham with regards to an unidentified observation of 8 November 1967.
Major Quintanilla informed Captain Cunningham that a discrepancy report had been prepared by the University of Colorado with regards to an unidentified observation of 5 November 1967 by a pilot. Captain Cunningham said yes there had been a write-up in the report, however, he would attempt to contact the pilot and send the University of Colorado a report, and Major Quintanilla a report on the sighting.

MEMORANDUM
To: E. U. Condon
From: E. J. Ruppelt
Subject: Comment on Air Base Cooperation with the GU-UFO Project

1. On 8 November 1967, a military pilot, while airborne, reported to the Chicago Center, visual observation of an unknown object and radar tracking of six other unknown objects. The pilot was color-blind and reported the objects to change color from red to yellow to white. The report indicated that six to eight objects were tracked by radar within a range of one and a half to five miles. The Chicago Center identified these as being normal aircraft, but no details of this observation were available.

2. No report of this sighting was sent to the GU Project. Project personnel contacted the Chicago Center and discussed the possibility of obtaining further details, but the observational data had apparently been destroyed by December 19, when the report was conveyed to Project personnel. Project personnel was also informed that the original film record of the observations, made during the sightings by Dec 19, had also been destroyed.

3. Since the report seemed a particularly interesting one, Project personnel sought additional information from the Chicago Center. Telephone contact with Chicago Center on 19 December disclosed that the report had been discussed with the Officer Commanding Air Defense Command, Col. C-----, who had indicated he would contact the pilot and send GU whatever information could be obtained. The GU Project received no further information as a result of this contact.

4. Telecon 13 December with Major Nichols, Chanute AFB, revealed that after the reporting pilot had returned to Omaha, all information was suppressed to Base Operations at Offutt AFB.

5. Since no information had yet been received from Capt. Cunningham (indented) or his crew, the GU project is unable to give any details of the observation. The CUFON (Cunningham's) report, though submitted, had by December 19 been destroyed. Although Vandeventer and Christiansen had been unavailable, Capt. Cunningham indicated he would forward details of the UFO incident to us shortly.

-2- 21 FEBRUARY 1968

No report had been received by 31 January 1968. According to further information which Capt. Quintnilian, Hq USAF, Chanhute AFB, had gone on temporary duty and only now would be available for interview. Chinhphan agreed to give priority to obtaining Quintnilian's statement, asking him to send immediately a copy of the initial UFO sighting report which Grattit received through Chicago Center. The latter was done, and a copy is attached.

As of this date (21 February 1968) no report of the UFO incident of 19 December 1967 has yet been received by the Colorado Project from Chanhute AFB or other source.

TO: UFO REPORT INVESTIGATED BY CAPT. ARRINGTON, CHANHUTE AFB. DURING 19 DECEMBER 1967 INCIDENT WITH CAPT. QUINTNILIAN OF PROJECT BLUE BOOK, REGARDING THE ABOVE INCIDENT, IT WAS LEARNED THAT A CAPT. ARRINGTON, OF CHANHUTE AFB, HAD INTERVIEWED CAPT. QUINTNILIAN AND OTHERS WHO HAD OBSERVED AND STUDIED THE SIGHTING. CAPT. QUINTNILIAN AND MAJOR QUINTRILLIA SAID CAPT. ARRINGTON HAD CONFIRMED THAT THE LIGHTS SEEN WERE A "SWINGING" CAMERA ATTACHED TO THE MISSILE. MAJOR QUINTRILLIA SAID CAPT. ARRINGTON HAD SECURED A PRELIMINARY REPORT WITH DETAILS OF THE SIGHTING REGARDING THIS MATTER AND WOULD BE FORWARDING IT TO PROJECT BLUE BOOK.

INQUIRY WAS MADE ABOUT IT DURING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PERIOD, BUT DID NOT INDICATE THAT THIS WAS A PARTICULARLY STRANGE OR INTERESTING UFO REPORT. INQUIRY WAS MADE ABOUT IT DURING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PERIOD WITH CHANHUTE AFB. IT WAS AGREED THAT CAPT. ARRINGTON HAD SECURED THE NECESSARY INFORMATION, PICTURES AND A COMPLETE REPORT OF THE UFO SIGHTING TO THE COLORADO PROJECT.

ON 21 FEBRUARY 1968, A CALL TO CHANHUTE AFB ON THAT DATE REVEALED THAT CAPT. ARRINGTON HAD STATED THAT HE HAD CLEARED UP THE 19 DECEMBER 1967 MATTER AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE FORTHCOMING. A CALL TO MAJOR QUINTRILLIA AT THAT TIME VERIFIES THAT CAPT. ARRINGTON'S EARLIER PLANS TO MAKE COPIES OF THE REPORT AND SEND IT TO PROJECT BLUE BOOK AND TO THE COLORADO PROJECT HAD NOT BEEN FULFILLED, AND HE INDICATED HE WOULD COMPLETE THIS ON 21 FEBRUARY. AS OF 21 FEBRUARY, NEITHER PROJECT BLUE BOOK NOR THE COLORADO PROJECT HAD RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM CHANHUTE AFB REGARDING THE 19 NOVEMBER 1967 UFO REPORT.
