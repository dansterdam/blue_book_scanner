10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Round, steady golden light which looked like a star and was moving fairly fast. Observed from window at 70* elevation.
12. CONCLUSIONS
Witnesses probably saw an a/c, but due to inconsistencies in the report, much as window, and vagueness in report, the case is listed as insufficient data.

The image on this page of the UFO report document from Project Blue Book does not contain any photographs. It consists of two sketches - one showing a curved line with an arrow pointing to indicate the object's movement, and another larger sketch depicting a road with buildings and a horizon. The second sketch has two smaller inset sketches, one showing a person standing on the road, and the other showing a larger view of the horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show where the object was when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The provided image does not contain a photograph, but rather a document titled "UFO ANALYSIS SHEET" regarding an incident that occurred in Dayton, Ohio on May 16, 1960. 

The text in the document is as follows:

Location: Dayton, Ohio
Date: 16 May 1960 Hour: 2025
WX: Clearly, 7 mi vis, surf winds SE at 4 knots
Description: White light, size of saucer, would move when on, then appeared to remain stationary when off, light apparently turned on and off four or five times before it disappeared, in sight for 5 to 7 minutes, was first and last seen in the Southeast.
Direction of Motion: Northwest
Satellites: (AFGWC-4#3, Phone 69219) Ruled out
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.) Ruled out
Radar Analysis (AFGWC-4#l) None
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.) Ruled out
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc: Four Aircraft
Other: 
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Probably unreliable due to young age of 12.
Analysis and Conclusions: Although the source states that the light apparently remained off for about 1 minute, this is considered to be consistent with the description of a sighting of C-133 cargo transport aircraft... There is a small airstrip in the city of Dayton, and an aircraft from it could have been observed. Also, there is a small airport in the city of Dayton, and an aircraft from it could have been observed.
