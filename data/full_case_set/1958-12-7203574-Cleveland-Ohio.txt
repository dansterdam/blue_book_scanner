The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon line, and instructions for marking positions "A" and "B" on the curved line to indicate how high the object appeared above the horizon. The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene with a person standing in the foreground, and a smaller inset sketch of a landscape in the background.

Here is the OCR output for the text in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
