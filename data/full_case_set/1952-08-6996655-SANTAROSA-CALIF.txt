AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: United States
DATE OF REPORT: 7 August 1952
PLACE: Santa Rosa, California 
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
DATE/TIME GROUP: 7 August 1952, 1330 Pacific Daylight Time
OBSERVER(S): Ground Observer

An unidentified object was first observed visually at 1315 Pacific Daylight Time, and it was tracked on radar for 15 minutes. It was observed approximately 5 to 7 miles south of Santa Rosa, California, at an elevation of approximately 1,000 feet. Its speed was estimated to be 400 to 500 miles per hour. The object maneuvered rapidly, making a series of right-angle turns. After it had been observed for approximately 5 to 7 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared at a very high rate of speed.

The object was reported to be round, bright and luminous. It appeared to be 12 to 15 feet in diameter. The Air Force was notified and the 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron, Hamilton AFB, California, was assigned to investigate. No further information is available to determine the identity of the object.
