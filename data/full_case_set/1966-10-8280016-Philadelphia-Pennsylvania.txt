The image contains a sketch diagram that appears to be part of a UFO report document. The diagram has instructions for the observer to imagine a scenario and answer questions about the path and movement of an observed object. There is no photograph present in this particular image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the survey line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the survey line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "D" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document containing handwritten text.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 8 - 9 - 66
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points
questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I FIRST THOUGHT THE OBJECT TO BE ECHO, BUT HESITATION IN MOVEMENT, THE STOPPING OR SLOWING AT 215-245 DEGREES, AND THE CHANGE IN DIRECTION SUGGESTED SOMETHING ELSE. 

THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT MAY PROVE IRREGULAR WAS HEAVY AIR TRAFFIC IN THE DIRECTION 3 HOURS AFTER MY SIGHTING MOVED IN MY DECISION TOWARD THIS OBJECT. APPEARED FOR 15 MINUTES BOTH AT CLOSE AREA IN THIS TIME.

- page 10 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report or letter describing an incident concerning aerial phenomena. The text mentions observing a "blueish white" object in the sky that changed direction and appeared to move from side to side. The observer also mentions seeing an "unusual abundance of planes flying in the area" and would appreciate any information concerning the nature of the sighting.
