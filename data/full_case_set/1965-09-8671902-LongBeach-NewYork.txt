The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram or illustration. The diagram shows a compass and instructions for sketching the motion of an unidentified object or objects.

Here is the text from the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  3 Day  Sept  1965 Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: 

I again sighted a similar light on Sep. 9, 1965 over the city area of North Little Rock, Arkansas. The first sighting occurred on Aug. 5, 1965 and was of a light similar to the first in brightness and maneuver. The light on Sep. 9 appeared about 10:30 P.M. and was observed for about 10-15 minutes. I was called outdoors to observe this light along with several other people. The light appeared to stop and hover, then moved off rapidly to the northeast and disappeared from sight. I called Saline County ARC, but no one else had reported seeing the light.

It is my belief that what I saw on both occasions was a satellite. However, the satellite could not have been a normal satellite because of its brightness and maneuver. Perhaps experimental or more advanced type of satellite, possibly launched by the USSR. Two program news articles which were with me at the time have recently been confiscated from me at the Cape. Maybe they contained some information on this satellite but I do not know.

As per the OCR instructions, here is the text found in the document:

30. Case #D

A bright light was seen at same time (Sept) as a large (round?) shape of a material moved at a constant speed of an estimate. The object traveled through 135Â° in 2.7 minutes - 

A spotty at A, different at the horizon.
The lighting was remarkable - not one of the best (at that time) type of materialization of UFO's.
We were just mystified and speculated for many days.

WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO

NOV 12 1965

TO: HQ USAF SAFOID (Mrs Hunt)

Reference the attached report of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting at Cloverdale, Ohio on 2 September 1965 as forwarded to you by the UFO TPEW/UFO. The following characteristics of this sighting are of particular interest:

1. The object was observed to move in a circular path and was simultaneously observed by more than one observer.
2. The object appears to have been surrounded by a luminous glow or "halo" around its circumference.
3. The object was seen to hover and then to move away at a very high rate of speed.
4. The object was of considerable size (estimated 50-100 feet in diameter) and was observed to be at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet above the terrain.

If the above information is correct, then it is likely that a high-flying aircraft was the cause of the sighting.

February 18, 1966
Mrs. Hunt c/s/ SAPOICC/769h/18 Feb 66

Dear Mrs. Hunt,

This letter is a reply to your report of an earth object which became visible to your observation on the night of February 18, 1966.

Your sighting, as one of a characteristic of a satellite overflying the area, was not a satellite of a peculiar operation sighting. According to the data in our files, the eastbound passage of the city of Long Beach was that of a satellite drifting inertly in orbit, carrying out its prescribed functions. There was nothing to indicate that the object sighted was anything other than the normal passage of a satellite, clearly visible to those who may have observed it closely.

We appreciate your observance of the overflight and your desire to cooperate in the Air Force's continuing study of satellite operations. However, we find no basis for the conclusion that the object sighted was anything other than a normal satellite. The attached form indicates the details of our evaluation of your report.

TO USAF AARDOC (Mrs. Bent)
MAX-SCDC-250
Arlington, Virginia 22202

SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Flying
Object, 7 Nov 65, Cleveland, Ohio.

On 7 Nov 65, at approximately 1805 hrs. EST, the undersigned observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over Cleveland, Ohio. The sighting occurred while the witness was in his car en route to Cleveland. The object was first observed slightly to the north and slightly above the horizon. It appeared as a bright, white light, similar to a very bright star. The object was in sight for approximately 5-10 minutes and moved in a southerly direction, gradually descending.

The object appeared to be considerably higher than normal aircraft and was SILENT. There were no other known aircraft in the immediate vicinity at the time. If there were nearby aircraft, they were NOT VISIBLE.

In view of the facts that the object exhibited characteristics which differed from conventional aircraft, and the sighting is considered POSSIBLY of an unknown or unidentified aerial vehicle, it is requested that this report be forwarded as appropriate for any further investigation or analysis.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is as follows:

My sighting was on the night of Aug. 21/22 - 1965. Shortly after 2 A.M. I was awakened by a bright light inside my house. I looked out and saw a large object hovering over the neighboring houses - which appeared to be about 50 ft in diameter. The object was bright with a variable light showing flashing lights around the edge as if it rotated and pulsated. It was silent except for an occasional swishing sound. After about 10 min. it suddenly accelerated and disappeared in a straight line at great speed. I and others in the neighborhood saw this and were quite bewildered by it.

Sincerely

This refers to your earlier telephone conversation to identify a bright object sighted on the night of 6 Sep 65.

This office has completed its investigation of the sighting of the metallic object reported by you. Based on the information you provided, we have determined that the sighting was of a high-altitude illumination flare dropped by an aircraft in support of training operations.

I regret any inconvenience this may have caused you. However, I trust this information helps to resolve your concern. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact me again.
