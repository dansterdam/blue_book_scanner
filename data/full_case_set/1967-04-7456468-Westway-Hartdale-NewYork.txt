Proposed reply to letter from
Dear 
Reference your recent letter regarding your unidentified
observation. A check of the satellite schedules revealed
you probably observed Echo II. This satellite would have
been passing over the central Ohio area at approximately 12
EST on April 29, 1967 in a northerly direction.
I am unaware of the satellite which was visible at
2042; however, our records do indicate Echo II would have
been visible at the above mentioned time and moving toward
the north.
Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
