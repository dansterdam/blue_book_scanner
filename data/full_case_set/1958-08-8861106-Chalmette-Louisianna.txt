This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Project 10073 record card from Project Blue Book, which documented UFO sightings. The card provides details about a sighting that occurred in Chalmette, Louisiana on August 8, 1958. The observation was made by civilian observers, and three star-like objects were observed in the sky, moving at high speed in formation and able to stop in mid-air. The observers were unable to identify the objects, and no further conclusions were drawn.
