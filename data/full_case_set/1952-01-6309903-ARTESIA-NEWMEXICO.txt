APPENDIX I
Artesia, New Mexico - 16 January 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On 16 January 1952, two members of a balloon project from the General Mills Aeronautical Research Laboratory and four other civilians observed two unidentified aerial objects in the vicinity of the balloon they were observing. The objects were described as having a spherical or circular shape, and were 30,000 ft. and 20,000 ft. in altitude at the time of the observation.

The objects were observed twice, once from Artesia, New Mexico, and once from the Artesia Airport. In the first instance, one round object was observed moving in an arc, and in the second instance, two objects were observed, one smaller than the other. The balloon, according to the witnesses, was at an altitude of 5,000 ft. and the objects were observed at higher altitudes.

A short time later the same two observers and four civilian pilots were observing the balloon from the Artesia Airport. Two objects at approximately the same location were observed northwest. They circled the balloon, or apparently so, and flew off to the northwest. The time of observation was about 60 seconds. The two objects were the same color and size as the first object. They were flying side-by-side. When the objects disappeared from view, they disappeared and the observers assumed they were disc-shaped and had turned on edge to bank.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
Unfortunately this report was not made until 5 April and did not reach ATIC until 16 April. Due to this time lapse, no further investigation is contemplated. The observers are known to be very reliable and experienced.

III. CONCLUSIONS
None.

The text in the document is as follows:

IOD 24/27-5

the balloon previously  so referred at the scene alites was 4l-inches in diameter and had a burst rate of 12 psi which in turn created a large hole in the side of the balloon causing it to plunge to the ground. The object observed was seen to remain stationary for approximately 30 minutes and then it rose rapidly in a vertical manner and disappeared from view at an estimated height of approximately twenty-five (25) degrees. Before the balloon came into view, the object was observed because its movement and abnormal behavior attracted attention. As it rose to an estimated height of approximately three (3) miles, it was observed to change direction several times and its apparent size changed from the size of a dime to the size of a quarter, indicating its motion was neither straight nor uniform. It had been observed carefully through a telescope and binoculars.The size of the object was estmated to be approximately 25-30 feet in diameter. It's movement was absolutely silent and gave the impression of a controlled flight though it was an irregular shape rather than the usual streamlined shape of airplanes. The color of the object could not be determined due to the lack of sunlight. However, it's movements were so unusual and the silence of its flight so striking that it could not be dismissed as an ordinary aircraft. The report indicates the object was at all times clearly visible against the sky on a clear day and its motion was carefully observed through binoculars and a telescope.

REPORT

1. This investigation is predicated upon information contained in a basic report submitted by the United States Air Force Base in the area of Artesia, New Mexico on 16 Jan 1952. An interview with the principal witness was made to corroborate, expand and clarify the written report which stated that while on a routine test run with a 600 mcf gas balloon, the object observed appeared to be white or silver in color, larger than the balloon and at a higher altitude. It appeared slightly elliptical in shape and was observed for several minutes as it passed overhead at a speed estimated to be approximately 200 m.p.h. within the vicinity of their test balloon on 13 January 1952.

2. On 21 Jan 1952 a formal technical report was interviewed to the investigation. This report stated that on the above date at approximately 1725 hours (5:25 P.M. MST) the witness, a technical sergeant, was standing near the balloon launch site and observed an object which he described as silvery or metallic appearing in color, approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter, and elliptical in shape, moving at a very high rate of speed in level flight at an altitude estimated to be about 10,000 feet. The object was observed to be traveling in a southerly direction, making no sound, and leaving no vapor trail. After observing the object for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, it disappeared from sight. It was stated that the balloon was traveling east to west at an altitude of approximately 800 feet at the time the object was observed.
