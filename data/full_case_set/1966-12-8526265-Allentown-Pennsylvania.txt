OCR output:

My friend and I were
observing the stars one
night from our yard
when a light appeared
in the sky to the north
east. It seemed to come
closer and then suddenly
vanish. We thought it was
a satellite at first, but
it didn't move like a
satellite and it was much
larger. It was round and
yellow-orange in color.
We watched it for about
5 minutes before it disappeared.
We couldn't hear any sound
from it. I don't know what it
was, but it was unlike anything
I've ever seen before.
