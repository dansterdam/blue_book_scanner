The image contains a newspaper article with the headline "Miami Pilots Saw 'Saucers' Around Bragg". The article describes an encounter between two Miami pilots and unidentified flying objects, or "saucers", that they observed around the Bragg Air Force Base in North Carolina.

Here is the text of the article as extracted by the OCR system:

THE NEWS AND OBSERVER, RALEIGH, N.C., TUESDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 17, 1950.

Miami Pilots Saw 'Saucers' Around Bragg

Raleigh, N.C., Oct. 16.--(AP) What
Capt. George W. Woodward of Miami,
Fla., says he saw flying a Miami Air-
lines, Inc., DC-4 over North Carolina yes-
terday might not have been flying sau-
cers, but he doesn't know what
they were.

Woodward and his Co-Pilot Williams
reported seeing four shiny objects that
couldn't identify. The Civil Aero-
nautics Administration office here re-
ceived the report late yesterday.

TWO WEEKS AGO, Woodward re-
ported seeing three objects like "bal-
loons" two weeks ago.

"THIS TIME, if from Raleigh, for
miles later I saw four shiny objects
that looked like balloons," Woodward
said. "Do you see them?"

I told him I did not see them at
that distance. He said they appeared
to be about 100 feet in diameter, or some
other estimate like "a minimum of
25 feet." They were scattered in a
group of five, he said, like the five
saucers fitted together.

"They were in line when we first
saw them and we chased them but they
backed off and disappeared," he said.
They were "Flying pretty fast," he said.
Woodward said the objects were about
15 years old and had never seen such
objects on his travels, that he was sure
what he saw, but he wasn't positive
they weren't planes.

The objects were sighted near Pope Air
Force Base, Fort Bragg, N.C., and
also over Lumberton, N.C. and Florence, S.C., he
said.

There does not appear to be a photograph present in this page of the UFO report document from Project Blue Book. 

The text found in the document is as follows:

SUBJECT: Report of unconventional type e/c 
TO: Director of Intelligence United States Air Force.

1. The following report of observation of unconventional type aircraft is submitted in spite of the termination of inquiry into this subject.

2. On Oct. 15, 1950, at 1625 EST, the undersigned observed a jet plane(s) moving in a Northeasterly direction at an altitude of 35-40,000 feet. Plane(s) not visible but characteristic sound accompanied flight as well as an easily observed and clearly defined contrail.

3. At 1625.40 while observer was following the flight of the jet plane(s) an object solate and spheric in shape crossed the line of flight of the jet plane(s) and continued its movement in a Northwesterly direction. Total length of observation, 10-12 seconds.

4. Object appeared to be constructed of aluminum or like substance...speed unknown...altitude unknown...trail none. Object followed a perfectly straight line of flight.

5. Observer realizes that paucity of detail in this report makes it undoubtable material from an intelligence standpoint, but there is a strong likelihood that the object sighted is the same or one of the same objects sighted and reported by a commercial air lines pilot of the Miami Air Lines. He reported sighting a group of saucer-like objects (four in number) in the vicinity of Pope AFB, N.C., at 1620 EST. Pilot pursued objects for period of time before losing them.

6. If certain assumptions are made, the following conclusions are well within the realms of possibility: 
Pilot's time of observation - 1620 EST

DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS

Transcribing the text in the document:

UNCLASSIFIED:
Length of pursuit (estimated) - 3 minutes
Speed of pursuing a/c (estimated) - 180 mph.
If pursuit is made in a Northerly direction and broken off at end of three minutes, this would place the objects sighted about 10 miles North of Pope AFB at 1623 EST.
Airline distance from point of his observation to Chapel Hill, N.C. (assumed to be the point of next observation) is approximately 47 miles.
Time elapsed from point of last observation to point of next observation 2 minutes 20 seconds, distance traversed 47 miles. Speed of object 19 plus miles per minute, or roughly 1200 miles per hour.
7. Observer recognizes that conjecture is not a suitable basis for inquiry and offers the analysis in paragraph 6 only as a suggested method of evaluation.
8. The undersigned regards the above material to be of a classified nature and will so regard it.
