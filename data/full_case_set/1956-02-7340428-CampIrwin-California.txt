1. During the dates 3 February - 21 February 1956, sightings of unidentified flying objects were observed visually and in three instances by radar oscilloscope, operated by the 6702 AAA-AW BATTALION, at CAMP IRWIN, CALIFORNIA.

2. On 6 February 1956 between the hours 1300 - 1600, PFC RICHARD L. WALKER, Co "D", 4th BN, 81st Armd. Regt., observed an unidentified flying object moving from north to south at an altitude of over 15,000 feet.

PFC RICHARD L. WALKER also from Co "D" 4th BN, 81st Armd. Regt., observed an unidentified flying object moving from north to south at an altitude of over 15,000 feet. The object was described as oval in shape, brilliant luminosity, and no trail. It moved with a tremendous burst of speed from grid square 114 to grid square 115 in about four (4) minutes.

Officer(s) from the Air Force Intelligence personnel visited this installation for investigation and questioned witnesses, but could make no official determination as to the nature of the observations.

Results of radar data cannot be provided.

1. During the dates 7 February to 9 February 1956, sightings of unidentified flying objects occurred which were tracked by radar installations operated by the USASA and in three instances by radar controlled searchlights operated by the AAACS.

2. On 8 February 1956 between the hours 1300 - 1600, Pfc Richard E. Bolten, USASA, observed several light-emitting objects in the sky moving at extremely high speeds, estimated at over 2,000 miles per hour and at an altitude of over 25,000 feet.

3. On 9 February 1956 between the hours 1200 - 1400, Pfc Richard D. Warfe, and Pfc Sicard, both from Co. "A" 325th Tank Battalion, observed an unidentified object which appeared to be several miles distant and at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet. The object emitted a tremendous burst of speed from grid square 6114 to grid square 5314, a distance of approximately 7 miles, in 3 to 5 seconds.

4. The sightings were reported to the George Air Force Base Intelligence Officer. Air Force Intelligence personnel made a visit to this installation and confirmed the details of these sightings. The reliability of the witnesses is considered to be good.

1. During the dates 7 February - 21 February 1956, sightings of unidentified flying objects by members of this command were noted. Sightings were visual and in three instances by radar detection. The radar identification was confirmed by visual observation.

2. On 8 February 1956 between the hours 1302 - 1600, PFC Richard D. Walker, Co. C, 45th Tk. Bn., observed an unidentified object in the air which appeared to be metallic in construction and approximately 200 to 300 feet in diameter, and at an altitude of over 15,000 feet.

3. On 9 February at about 1300 hours, PFC Kenneth D. Marra, and PFC Richard, both from Co. "C", 45th Tk. Bn., observed an unidentified object which appeared to be circular in shape and of a metallic construction. The object was estimated to be 75 to 100 feet in diameter and at an altitude of approximately 8,000 to 10,000 feet. The object moved with a tremendous burst of speed from east to west and remained in sight approximately one to two minutes.

The sightings were reported to the George Air Force base intelligence office. Further intelligence reports will be forwarded when additional information is obtained.
