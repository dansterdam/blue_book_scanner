The text in the image describes an observation of an object that "increased to maximum in turn" and then "lost in sun after turn." It mentions the "bank angle of observer in turn 45°" and that a "Winterized F-84 has tail section painted which would eliminate flashing in sun."

The bottom portion of the image contains fields for "Name," "Address," and "Date," which suggests this was a form or report to be filled out.

APPENDIX 
Columbus, Ohio - 22 December 1951

I. DISCUSSION OF INCIDENT
On 22 December 1951 at approximately 1030 -55T, an F-84 pilot sighted an unidentified object five miles east of Columbus, Ohio. The object, which was silver in color, was traveling at a high rate of speed on a lateral axis. The object was on a reciprocal heading and higher than the F-84. The pilot made a turn in an attempt to intercept the object but lost it in the sun.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
At approximately 1000 EST, a weather balloon was released from the Columbus Municipal Airport. The winds aloft which would have normally carried the balloon over the area of the incident were low, and it is believed the balloon was still in the area at the time of the incident. Further information on the balloon launching has been requested.

III. CONCLUSIONS
No conclusions can be made until more information on the balloon launching is obtained.

Columbus, Ohio - 22 December 1951

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On 22 December 1951 at 1030 EST, the pilot of an F-84 aircraft observed an unidentified object near Columbus, Ohio. The F-84 was flying at 15,000 ft. altitude on a heading of 270°. The object was first sighted at two o'clock high. It appeared to be rolling on its longitudinal axis and emitted a glowing red shape resembled an aircraft with no tail surfaces. It was on a heading of about 300°.

The pilot observed the object for one and one half minutes during which he made a right turn in an attempt to identify the object. It was lost when the pilot turned into the sun to follow the object.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
The pilot of the F-84 aircraft was identified by Project personnel. The facts were written out. The pilot stated he could not identify the object. The pilot is not available for further interrogation. The wind was 30 knots from 270° which would place the balloon in the general area of the sighting. The pilot's opinion is that it was probably a balloon about 1000 to 1500 feet in diameter.

III. CONCLUSIONS
The F-84 possesses a high speed which would allow it to close on a slow moving object like a balloon. The reported actions of the object cannot be explained satisfactorily. The pilots have indicated that a balloon can be very deceptive when viewed from a high speed aircraft.

1. This compliance with Air Defense Command Letter 200-1 dated 11 April 1951 and in lieu of AF Form 112 the following information is submitted:

a. The object appeared to be an airplane of unknown size without a tail section and was silver in color. No trail or exhaust was seen and the propulsion system was unknown. The observer was flying in the opposite direction and the object appeared to be traveling at a greater speed than the observer's 200 miles per hour. No sound was heard and the object continued to tumble or roll until it was lost in the sun.

b. Object was sighted at approximately 13:30ZS on 22 December 1951 and was observed for approximately one (1) minute.

c. The object was observed visually from the air. The observer was flying an F-84D type aircraft at approximately 15,000 feet with an indicated air speed of 225.

d. The object was approximately 17+ (5) miles east of Columbus, Ohio heading west at an altitude of 15,000 feet when the object was first sighted. The object was at 200 objects high when the observer, heading in an easterly direction at an altitude of at least 20,000 feet.

The high degree of reliability of the observer is shown in the fact that he is a jet fighter pilot with approximately 1700 flying hours, having had combat experience as a fighter pilot during World War II.

f. The sky was clear at time of sighting.
g. None.
h. None.

i. Observer started to turn to give chase but object was lost in the sun.

STATEMENT ON SIGHTING
OF
UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT 

At approximately 1630 hours on 22 December 1951 I was flying locally at 15,000 feet. I observed an object which appeared to be an aircraft without a tail, travelling or rolling. Position of the object was about five (5) miles west of Columbus, Ohio heading east at an altitude of at least 20,000 feet. I was piloting an F-84C type aircraft in the opposite direction.

Chances of seeing the object were good as the day was clear and the sun was shining on the object. The three pilots stated that they were not in that area and at that altitude. The object was about three (3) miles east of my position and was rolling or tumbling at a high rate of roll.  I observed ten or more rolls in a period of one (1) minute when I lost it.

When I first sighted it it started a turn in an attempt to intercept the object but as I started to turn, the object was lost in the sun. Further search failed to bring the object in sight.

The speed appeared to be about that of a jet fighter. It did not gain or lose altitude. When last seen it was heading in an east-south easterly direction.
