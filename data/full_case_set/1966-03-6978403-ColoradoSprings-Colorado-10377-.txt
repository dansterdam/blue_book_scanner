Location: Colorado Springs, Colorado 
DESCRIPTION:  
At approximately 7:45 p.m. on March 6, 1966, a Mr. and Mrs. E. Crum were driving west on Fountain Boulevard in Colorado Springs, Colorado. As they reached the intersection of Fountain Boulevard and Union Boulevard, they observed a large circular object in the sky to the southwest. This object appeared to be hovering and was described as being about the size of a basketball at arm's length. The object was a bright reddish-orange color and seemed to have a halo or glow around the outer edge. 

After observing the object for several minutes, the Crums noticed that it began to slowly move in a southerly direction. The object then appeared to accelerate rapidly and disappear from sight. The Crums immediately reported this sighting to the Colorado Springs Police Department.
