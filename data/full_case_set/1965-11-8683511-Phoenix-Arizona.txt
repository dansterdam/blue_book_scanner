REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

DATE OF SIGHTING: November 29, 1955
TIME OF SIGHTING: 8:55 p.m. M.S.T.
Weather Bureau temperature: 54 degrees.
Sky conditions: Clear wind cirrus in west.

LOCATION OF SIGHTING: Phoenix, Arizona. 

Objects when first sighted appeared to be in flight. Looked like two sets of navigation lights side by side, remaining stationary among themselves. As vehicles moved across sky, remained in constant position with respect to each other. Elevation above eastern horizon: 25 to 30 degrees. Diameter of individual objects: Points or slightly elongated in direction of travel.

COLOR OF OBJECTS: Bright white. 

NO SOUND EVIDENT.

Estimated speed: Too high and too fast for aircraft if sound was to be component.
Much too fast for objects in orbit.
10 to 15 seconds as objects appeared, ascending like rockets, resolving into two separate lights, climbing higher and higher, until lost to sight. The V formations melted together into one large lighted area at the final portion of the sighting, 3:52 (5 minutes?)
Direction of their travel: Due north.
Total sighting time: From start to final estimated at 10 to 15 seconds.

They reported sighting nothing.
They did call F.A.A. Radar Center at Albuquerque, New Mexico, by direct line.

My qualifications as an observer:
Briefly taught aircraft identification during W.W. II. Astronomy is an instrument builder and observer. Occupation: Research & development business.
