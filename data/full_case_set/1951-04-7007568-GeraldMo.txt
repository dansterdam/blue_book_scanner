Gerald, Mo.

ROBERT A. EDMONSON, Editor

April 23, 1951

Federal Bureau of Investigation
St. Louis, Mo.

Gentlemen,

Mr. --- a elderly retired farmer who lives just east of this town, has asked that we report for him an unusual object seen in the sky this morning between 8:30 and 9 a.m.

He described to us an object, bright and shining, which moved slowly across the sky from south to north leaving a trail of white behind it. He is unable to estimate altitude of the object or its speed but estimates that the trail was about two miles in length. From his description, we figure that the object, whatever it was, left a contrail which slowly dissipated.

His main concern was that the phenomena be reported to some authorities. We are obliging by means of this letter.

Mr. Lambert does not have the reputation with us as being a publicity seeker and we have a tendency to believe that he DID see something.

The only thing that gives us cause to wonder is his report to us last week, Tuesday morning, that he saw what he thought was a meteor or comet that streaked across the sky to the north of this town from east to west. Weâ€™ve heard of no one else in this community who has seen either of these mysterious objects so we leave it to you people to decide for yourselves as to the veracity of those sightings.

Could it be that there IS something to this flying saucer business?

Yours very truly,

The Gerald Journal
