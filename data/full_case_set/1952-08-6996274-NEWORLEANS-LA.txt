had any of the others. Everyone was seeing the object and felt it was unliike anything they had ever seen. I have no idea what it was. There was considerable discussion from those around about what the objects could have been, there was no agreement. During the time it was visible, there was a feeling that something unusual was happening, but nothing dramatic happened, except the feeling generated while watching.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
AIR FORM 112 - PART II
UNCLASSIFIED

SUBJECT: Air Intelligence Report on Multiple Unidentified Flying Objects observed in the sky near Hamilton APB, Calif., on March 15, 1952.

The following is a report on unidentified objects that were observed in the sky in the vicinity of Hamilton APB, Calif., on March 15, 1952:

At 1219 hours: A pilot of a P-51 aircraft on a routine training mission reported visually sighting 4 objects at an estimated altitude of 25,000 feet. The objects were traveling in a straight line at an estimated speed of 500 mph and disappeared after approximately 10 seconds. The objects appeared to be round or oval in shape and were a silver or aluminum color. No exhaust or vapor trails were observed.

At 1225 hours: A second pilot of a P-51 aircraft reported visually sighting 10 objects at an estimated altitude of 25,000 feet. The objects were traveling in a straight line at an estimated speed of 600 mph and disappeared after approximately 15 seconds. The objects appeared to be round or oval in shape and were a silver or aluminum color. No exhaust or vapor trails were observed.

The observers were located at their homes on Hamilton APB, Calif. They were both experienced pilots stationed at Hamilton APB, Calif. 

The weather officer reports the skies were clear during the time of the sightings. Winds were 30-40 mph at 25,000 feet.

Meteorological activity, physical evidence of the sightings, identification of sighting sources and security classification of the report are discussed as investigative.

1. Concurs with preparing officer: The information available to the preparing officer concerning the unidentified objects sighted was as reported.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
28 AD, Roswell AAF, NM
TR-33-52
PAGE 2 OF 2

At 1815 MST, identified as 2 UFOB's, spherical in shape. They were tarnish-gray, elliptical in shape. They were about 25-30 feet in diameter, hovering at an altitude of 10,000-11,000 feet. They flew straight and level at a speed estimated at 500-600 mph. Observed through binoculars. The two objects then began a very fast, vertical climb and disappeared from sight. 

The observers were located at their homes on Hamilton AFB, Calif. 

The information provided is inconclusive to the preparing officer concerning the unidentified objects observed in this report. However, it indicates the possibility that the objects sighted were of unconventional design.

4 August 1952
Employed by Fourth Navy Finance Office, NOFF, New Orleans, La.
I would state that at about 9:38 pm on 3 August 1952 while I was in the front of my house on Port Street in front of a picture window adjusting the vacuum cleaner, I suddenly observed a bright light coming from a southerly direction. All of a sudden the "flying saucer" appeared from the horizon. It appeared that it was spinning clockwise causing a continuous blinking-white sparks from a white circle about two feet wide. I was looking at it from about a quarter of a mile, the same distance as the moon. As I waved to get my wife's attention, the object, higher than the moon, began to move faster than the moon. I did not want to get out the car and lose it or miss some of it. I was so stunned that I couldn't get the car anyhow. The sky was hazy in that section of the sky which prevented any further detection; there was a full moon. The object traveled at a very high rate of speed in a southerly direction. I could still see the object. It took every precaution to make sure that I wasn't seeing things. The object appeared to be about 2 yards in diameter and I could still see the object. There was a trail of a sparks from an emery wheel, spinning very fast. As an emery wheel the sparks came off in one spot, but this object had sparks all around it. The object did not leave any trail behind. Within the circle of the object there was a glow. The object disappeared so fast that I couldn't tell if there was anything like it before. The object I saw was traveling about 100 MPH.

The image contains a detailed description of a sighting of two large silver discs or "saucers" flying in the sky over California on August 3, 1952. The report states that the objects were seen by jet pilots on the ground, who described the objects maneuvering and circling a base in a dogfight-like fashion. The report also notes that the Air Force concluded the objects were likely balloons, based on the evidence provided. There is no photograph present in this image.

California, on the afternoon of August 3, 1952--toward the end of the summer's saucer scare (Chapter VII). As reported in the annals of saucerdom, "two huge silver disks, flying at different altitudes, had raced out of the east. As jet pilots on the ground watched them, the higher machine dived to the other one's level. Then the two saucers began to circle the base, maneuvering like fighter planes in a dogfight." [5, p. 120]
No evidence justifies the use of the words "saucer" or "machine," while ample evidence supports the Air Force conclusion that the UFOs were balloons. The two objects were first seen at 4:15 P.M. Ground observers at the Air Force base, with the aid of binoculars, described them as silver in color, circular in shape, 60 to 100 feet in diameter, and traveling from east to west at an estimated speed of 400 to 450 miles an hour. One object was at about 12,000 feet, the other at about 18,000 feet; as they moved to the west a distance of about fifteen miles, passing over the heads of the observers (but not "circling the base"), the higher object dived to about the level of the lower, and they bobbed about each other in a dogfight. They were in view for about an hour and a quarter. Toward the end of this period they were visible only intermittently because they were seen against the sun; three additional pairs of objects came into view in the same area, fifteen to twenty miles west of the observers (a total of eight objects) and, buffeted by the winds, drifted slowly westward.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 23-THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS appeared to carry on a dogfight, momentarily they appeared in a "diamond" formation extending over an area of about four miles. Since the witnesses were looking into the sun at objects fifteen or twenty'miles away, they found it difficult to follow the course of any one for any length of time.

The objects looked like balloons, behaved like balloons, and weather balloons had been released in the area that day. Conclusion: the "machines" were weather balloons [?].
