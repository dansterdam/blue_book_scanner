IWORJIMA ISLAND
RADAR OBSERVATION REPORT
Case No. 1
1. DATE OF OBSERVATION: 7 June 1953
2. TIME OF OBSERVATION: 2205 to 2225
3. LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: IWORJIMA ISLAND
4. OBSERVER'S NAME: MAJOR SAMUEL NEWTON, Base Radar Officer
5. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT OBSERVED:
At 2205 a large, fast-moving object appeared on the radar screen, traveling from north to south. It was observed for 20 minutes as it passed over the island and disappeared off the south edge of the screen. The object was erratically changing course and altitude and was estimated to be approximately 10,000 feet in altitude and traveling at a speed of 1500 mph. The size of the object on the radar scope was much larger than any known aircraft in the area.
6. COMMENTS:
This was an unusual radar observation, as the object exhibited characteristics which are not normally associated with aircraft. The radar operator was highly skilled and experienced, and there is no doubt that the object was detected and tracked. Possible explanations could include a malfunction in the radar set, unusual atmospheric conditions, or the presence of an unidentified flying object. Further investigation is warranted.
