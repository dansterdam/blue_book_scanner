APPEARED TO BE MOVING VERY SLIGHTLY. THIS OBSERVATION WAS MADE WHILE TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 70-80 MPH IN THE AUTOMOBILE. MRS.******** WATCHED THE OBJECT UNTIL THE AUTOMOBILE APPROACHED CRENA, ILLINOIS, AT WHICH TIME THE OBJECT FADED OUT AND DISAPPEARED. ON THE NIGHT OF 27 JULY 1960 I WAS DRIVING HOME ON CHANUTE AFB, ILLINOIS, WHEN ONE OF MY CHILDREN ASK ME WHAT THE BRIGHT OBJECT WAS IN THE SKY. I LOOKED DUE WEST AND OBSERVED THE MOON THOUGH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A HAZE LAYER. IT WAS ABOUT 1/4 FULL AND CAST A BRILLIANT ORANGE GLOW IN THE THE SKY. THE EXACT OUTLINE WAS NOT DISCERNIBLE BECAUSE OF THE HAZE, BUT A BRILLIANT, CRESCENT SHAPE GLOW MADE AN UNUSUAL APPEARANCE. THE MOON WAS 1/4 FULL ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION AND MOONSET WAS AT 0145Z. I QUESTIONED SEVERAL SERVICE STATION ATTENDANTS ON HIGHWAY 47 BETWEEN CRENA AND CISCO, ILLINOIS. NO ONE QUESTIONED OBSERVED ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE SKY OR THE NIGHT IN QUESTION. I AM CONVINCED THAT MRS.******** WAS OBSERVING THE 1/4 MOON THROUGH EITHER A HAZE LAYER OR A FLUFFY CLOUD. ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS WERE EXTRAPOLATED AND/OR OBSERVED FROM MAPS AND CHARTS FOR DECATUR.
