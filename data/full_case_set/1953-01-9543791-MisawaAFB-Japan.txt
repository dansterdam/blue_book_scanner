10. CONCLUSION: UNIDENTIFIED

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Visual: Stationary light which gradually changed color from white to reddish-orange and back. Observed by AF pilot at 5,000 ft at altitude of 19,000 ft. Object appeared on radar scope of F-94 which was on a training mission.
DETAILS: 1. Radar did not have unusual behavior throughout observation.
2. Pilot overshot object - object seemed to be rising. 
Altitude of the object was estimated to be around 50,000 ft.

CASE #31 (contau - page 3)
9 Jan 53
Object was light that continually changed color from red to white to green. No apparent movement or shape changes of object observed. Radar contact gave weak indistinct returns. Object sighted at 1350Z 9 Jan 53 with radar contact approximately 2 minutes, visual contact approximately 1 minute. Sighted visually without optical aids and by radar at 35,000' speed 220 knots heading 360 degrees made radar contact with object at range of 20,000 yards, 20 deg port asimuth, 10 deg below in elevation. Pilot's than sighted object visually and attempted to close but it disappeared at 35,000' at all times. No apparent movement of object but radar e/s changed heading object still 20 deg port in azimuth. Radar locked on at 5000 yards. As range decreased, angle of elevation of object below e/s increased. Azimuth reading remained constant. Radar contact broken with object at range of 800 yards, 20 deg port azimuth, 10 deg below in elevation. Pilot and radar operator observed object changing heading and speed but no estimate of reliability possible. Weather was approximately from 6500' to 13,000' with visibility unlimited above overcast. Winds at 20,000' were 150 knots from 290 deg, at 35,000' were 50 knots from 210 deg, radar observer reported unusual interference on set throughout mission but not appeared to be operative before and after contact. No physical evidence available. Interrogation attempted but contact lost when e/s overshot object. AATC Comment: Since the radar set had unusual behavior throughout the mission and the object and radar return seem to coincide, it is believed that object was weather balloon launched by the US ARC NIJU at Misawa.
