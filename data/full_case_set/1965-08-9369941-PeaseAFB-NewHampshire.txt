PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 20 August 65 2130
2. LOCATION: Pease AFB, New Hampshire
3. SOURCE: Military
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One or more.
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual, Radar
7. COURSE: NE, Northerly, Stationary

9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No

The report describes multiple objects observed, including satellites, ARCTURUS, and an unidentified object that was tracked on radar. The object was described as a high-speed moving A/C (aircraft), orbiting satellite, and a low altitude slow moving light. The object was observed by tower personnel and was considered an instantaneous and motion northerly slow object, characteristic of an alien report.

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present on this page. 

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"At 0652, 25 August 1975, the radio satellite was visible and precistently observed from airborne and ground observers on the flight line.

The object was observed maneuvering in a manner which could scarcely be described as that of a normal satellite.   Its visual motions were apparently erratic and could be described as "eccentric".

In conclusion, I believe that these sightings were nothing more than the appearance of the normal radio satellite to persons who are not familiar with the precise motions of such satellites.  The apparent erratic motions are not uncommon and are explicable in terms of the satellite's orbital mechanics. The conclusion is that this sighting represented the visual observation of an artificial earth satellite, and was not an "unidentified flying object" in the popular sense of the term."

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report titled "STATEMENT UFO SIGHTING" from Lt. Robert H. Kessler, 1st Lt. USAF, who was the Radar Supervisor on duty on August 20, 1965 at Pease AFB in New Hampshire. The report describes the sighting of a UFO tracked on radar and observed visually.

STATEMENT
UFO Sighting

I, Lt Robert H. Kessler, Radar Supervisor R.A.D.C.O.N., on 20 August 1965 at about 2325L tracked a UFO on radar from a position approximately seven miles northeast of Pease AFB. The object appeared on scope and had a steady, round, well-defined return. The size blip a light aircraft would produce. The object and separate but related speed tabs indicated the object to be moving rapidly. The object's speed was observed to follow the same track. Speed was steady. The object did not accelerate or decelerate. When the object passed near the RADCON site, an attempt was made to visually acquire it. No visual contact was made. The Boston Center was contacted and reported no aircraft under their control in that vicinity. There were no further sightings by RADCON.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

The following were the weather conditions from 2300L 23 August 1965 to 2100L 24 August 1965 in the vicinity of Pease AFB, New Hampshire.

1. Wind data over PSB (estimated):
2300L 220/25
0000L 220/30
0030L 220/30
0100L 222/27
0130L 224/26

2. Surface observations at PSB (local daylight saving time):
2300L Clear 30 290 31/20 13107 008 36/5
0000L Clear 30 190 32/20 13096 028 29/80
0030L Clear 30 160 30/24 13094 015 28/80

3. There were no thunderstorms in the area.

4. The average vertical temperature gradient from the surface to 5500' (indicated/18000' msl) was 3.9 degrees C per 1000 feet.

5. The following is a summary of the weather information atmospheric conditions at the time of 20 August 1965:
A series of 3 pressure systems moved toward the west of Pease with general minimum of 29.72 inHg. During this time, the wind conditions and cloud coverage remained relatively constant with northeasterly winds at 25-30 knots and scattered to broken clouds at 5,000-9,000 feet. The average vertical temperature gradient was within normal limits and there were no thunderstorms in the area. The weather conditions appeared to be normal for this time of year.

STATEMENT
UFO Sighting

It, Aic James R. Gray, AF44613462, did observe on the night of 22 August 1965 a bright object in the night sky near Pembroke, New Hampshire. The object appeared to move very slowly to the north. The object was observed for approximately one half hour. It was difficult to determine the size of the object. Determined radar was picking up a UFO in the same vicinity.
