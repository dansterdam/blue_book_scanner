OUTPUT TEXT:

10. CONCLUSION:

POSSIBLE "WEATHER" TYPE PHENOMENON. THE UNUSUAL FLIGHT PATH AND GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT OBSERVED SUGGEST THAT IT WAS MOST LIKELY SOME TYPE OF WEATHER PHENOMENON RATHER THAN A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR ANY OTHER KNOWN TYPE OF AERIAL OBJECT.

TYPE OF OBSERVATION:

VISUAL AND RADAR OBSERVATION. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED VISUALLY BY THE WITNESS AND ALSO TRACKED ON RADAR.

DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:

WITNESS OBSERVED A FAST-MOVING BRIGHT OBJECT THAT APPEARED TO BE CIRCLING OR MAKING LOOPS. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 10 MINUTES.

RADAR SCOPE OPERATORS TRACKED THE OBJECT DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD AND NOTED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE CIRCLING OR LOOPING WHILE MAINTAINING A RELATIVELY RAPID RATE OF SPEED.

TOTAL EVIDENCE:

INSUFFICIENT TO WARRANT ANY DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. The sighting was very close, during which time an object was observed that was in the air, some 30-40 feet above ground and about 100-150 feet away, illuminated in a colorful manner with flashing lights that seemed to change color. The object appeared to be some 40-50 feet in diameter and was a sort of circular shape. The object made no sound whatsoever. The night was clear and there was nothing in the sky except this object. The size and appearance of the object as well as the closeness of the sighting made a very definite impression on the observers. The experience lasted about 2 to 3 minutes, during which time several people were able to observe the object clearly.

This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a historical government study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is a MEMO FOR THE RECORD about a UFO sighting that occurred on October 19, 1967 in Williamstown, West Virginia. The text describes the details of the sighting, including the object's appearance, movements, and the observer's account.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

Subject: UFO Report, 19 October 1967

On 20 October 1967 received a call from [REDACTED] Petersburg, Va. 

On 19 October at 9:05 pm EDT at Williamstown, W. Va. he sighted a UFO. The total duration of the sighting was about 40 seconds. (20 seconds in car and 20 seconds outside of car). There was one other witness to sighting. [REDACTED] did not know his name but got his license plate number.

The object had wings like a horseshoe and had lights all along the wings. The lights on the wings were red and green and there were (pass.) white lights on body of the craft. None of the lights flashed but were on constantly. These wings met in front and joined; the height of the object 35-40 mile.

He saw object while driving, it seemed to be hovering. He then stopped, it was directly overhead. He heard a deep jet sound and the craft started to move slowly. It did a semi-circle and disappeared behind a hill. The observer was looking toward Williamstown.

The object disappeared and estimated his distance as 4 miles from a nearby airport.

There was a full moon that you could just barely see and it was a clear night.

PROJECT 10073 RECORD
10. CONCLUSION
(BEARING MAIN)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers described the object as "light-self-luminous" and elevation from ground was estimated at a point of light. It appeared to be a point of light changing colors to red and green. There was no sound. The object was observed at an elevation of 20 deg in the northwest. The observers are apparently reliable, and their observation is considered to be accurate as to elevation and azimuth. The in-and-out movement and sudden disappearance of the object is somewhat unusual.

When I realized that the reflection had moved, I realized definitely that I could not explain it satisfactorily from what I had observed. I tend obviously to discount any possibility of a hoax or falsification. What I would say in conclusion is that the properties here mentioned have been established, and it is difficult to find any wholly ordinary explanation for this - though of course one might be possible. I should be very glad indeed to hear of any possibility of an ordinary explanation, as I am naturally most reluctant to consider anything extraordinary. The subject is obviously one requiring the greatest care and vigilance.

The text on the page includes a form with various fields related to sighting conditions, weather, and observations. The bottom portion of the form contains a handwritten description of a sighting, which mentions a "point of light" that appeared to be a "white light", and it was described as being "stable" and "motionless".

1. ABOUT 9:15 PM, WHILE GOING BY THE ROAD, I BECAME AWARE OF A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY, APPROXIMATELY 30-40 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. IT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND ABOUT 3-4 TIMES THE SIZE OF A NORMAL STAR, AND WAS TRAVELING AT ABOUT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE, MOVING VERY RAPIDLY IN A SOUTH TO NORTH DIRECTION. THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

2. LAST CALL TO LOOK UP SHOW THAT A SIMILAR OBJECT SEEN AT 8:45 PM IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA, MOVING WITH A VERY RAPID ANGULAR VELOCITY IN A NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST DIRECTION. THIS HAPPENED SOME 15-20 MINUTES PRIOR TO MY SIGHTING. I REALIZE THAT WHAT I SAW WAS NOT A NORMAL AIR CRAFT, AND IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE A METEOR, NOR A SATELLITE, SINCE IT WAS MOVING MUCH TOO RAPIDLY AND ITS ANGULAR VELOCITY WAS FAR TOO GREAT. I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INFORMATION YOU MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ON THIS MATTER.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing the position of an aircraft and the reliability of the observers.

THE POSITION OF ANY AIRCRAFT IN THE LOCAL AREA AND ITS REFERENCE TO THE POSITION OF A SIGHTING SUCH AS THIS COULD BE DETERMINED VISUALLY OR BY SIMPLY REFERRING TO THE AIRPORT SEARCH RADAR SCOPE WHICH CAN GIVE INFORMATION AS TO THE LOCATION OF ALL AIRCRAFT IN THE LOCAL AREA. IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THE CAUSE OF THE SIGHTING WAS OTHER THAN THAT OF THE AIRCRAFT, AS THE LOCAL MOVEMENT AND POSITION OF THE AIRCRAFT IS KNOWN. THE DURATION, MANEUVERABILITY AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT, AS WELL AS THE EXPERIENCE AND RELIABILITY OF THE OBSERVERS, IS CONCLUDED THAT A PHENOMENON OF SOME SORT WAS OBSERVED BUT THE LOGICAL CAUSE CANNOT BE DETERMINED.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.
