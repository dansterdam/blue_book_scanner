There is a sketch in the document that represents an unidentified flying object (UFO). The drawing depicts an elongated object with a pointed tip on each end. It features dark shading on its body, highlighted by what is described as a "faint white glow" suggesting illumination from the opposite side. The rear of the object shows a "burnt orange flare-like exhaust."

SPECIAL INQUIRY

3 July 1952

1. The following information pertaining to the above captioned
subject is transmitted to your headquarters, as received by this office
from the 5th District OSI, Louisville, Kentucky Attachment:
"On 27 June 1952, Captain JACK WEBB, 109th CIC Detachment
Louisville, Kentucky, advised that Special Agent EDWARD J. LAMMER,
109th CIC Detachment, interviewed on 26 June 1952, Mr.
DRPP, Contractor, Greensboro, Kentucky, concerning instant matter.
DRPP is a former Major (Reserve USNR) and presently a Lt. Colonel
in the Kentucky National Guard. DRPP stated that he saw his first 'flying saucer' on 23 June 1952 at approximately 1000 hours. The
sighting took place 3 miles east of Greensboro on U.S. highway 60.
DRPP was walking north when he heard a noise similar to a flight
of aircraft but high altitude. Upon looking up and ahead of the noise,
he saw two round objects resembling giant soap bubbles that reflected
the sun in a yellow-lavenderish light. The objects were proceeding
north, flying in trail (one behind the other) and passed out of
sight in about five (5) seconds. DRPP sustained the objects were
at 15 to 20 thousand feet altitude. The sighting took place on a
very bright, clear day. DRPP added that he was accompanied by
C. C. RYAN, who saw only one of the objects. No further pertin-
ent information was obtained from DRPP by Special Agent LAMMER."

**SOURCE**

**SUMMARY:**

1. On 23 June 1952 at 2000 local time, 12 witnesses have reported a brilliant light near the horizon to the southeast. These lights appear to be at 12 o'clock relative to the observer’s position and what they saw was their appearance was that of two stars. However, they were in a position where speed was not normal speed for stars.

2. Major Elwohl proceeded south and west to the intersection of Grand Avenue and Route 83 at which time he turned south and noticed those two objects which had by this time moved several thousand miles, the observer's stand still put on Route 83 was that he observed the objects coming into view at a rather slow rate of movement towards the west. As he approached the intersection of Route 83 and Route 66 he noticed that two more reliable objects had materialized; they had the same intense white brilliance. After turning west on the Route 66 he continued to observe the objects and saw the center increase its altitude abruptly so that the three objects formed a very extensive triangle. Continuing to be notified, the appearance of two more of these objects which seemed to have come from the southwest. At this point all five objects formed a rather lengthy line in the sky running east and west and their movement was reported to be that all five were moving eastward.

3. As they approached a Major Elwohl position on the highway he stopped his car and stopped one observer close beside him to better advantage. Their altitude to be in the vicinity of 6000 to 7000 feet; each one having no visible traditional radar or air-to-air built visibility from a distance. To the rear and slightly above the white 12th was a rather intense red blinker light he assumed these objects to be approximately 1000 yards apart in a single file traveling at a rather slow rate of speed. He heard the sound of engines which to that indication needed more notice; the engines used on a helicopter. Most of the objects to his observation were not conventional type aircraft. The brilliance of the lights as seen with the position and type of blinker were not like anything now in use on commercial or military aircraft.

End Major Elwohl reported this information to Capt. Everett F. Turner, USAF, 4761st Ord Sw., 5701 S. Lake Shore Dr., Chicago, Ill. as approximately 0100 hours 24 June 52.

4. These objects were also observed by his wife, who was with him at the time and who is also a qualified pilot.
