34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 11 August 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
are not adequate, so I'll try to explain here. I was sitting in my car at night when I noticed something in the sky. At first I thought it was a star, but as I watched it, I realized it was moving. It was round and a very bright, whitish-green color. I started talking to my passengers and we looked up again and saw a moving light object, which then seemed to split into two objects. The objects moved around in the sky and I informed all who were with me. We watched them for about 10 minutes before they disappeared from our view. They moved in a very erratic manner, zig-zagging and sometimes seeming to stop and hover. I could not make out any definite shape or size, and I was unable to hear any sound from the object(s). We tried to estimate the distance, but since we had no reference points, we could not be sure. The objects did not seem to be too high in the sky, perhaps around 1000 feet. I have no idea what they were and I wish I could have had a better look. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else reported seeing something similar in the area that night. I have no explanation for what we saw.

RECEIVED 15 AUG 1968
TO: LOU CHERNIN
FROM: DANIEL CHRISMAN
SUBJECT: INCIDENT REPORT

On 8 August 1966, at approximately 2230 hours, I was driving alone in my personal vehicle on Highway 611 near Philadelphia, PA. As I approached the intersection of Highway 611 and Blair Mill Road, I observed a bright light in the sky, approximately 150-200 feet above the ground. The light appeared to be circular in shape and extremely bright, illuminating the entire area.

As I continued to observe the light, it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from view. At no time did I observe any solid structure or object associated with the light. The light simply appeared and then vanished.

I immediately stopped my vehicle and contacted the local police department to report the incident. The police responded and questioned me regarding what I had observed. I provided them with a detailed account of the event.

This incident was subsequently reported to the United States Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, the official government program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs). I was later contacted by representatives of Project Blue Book and provided a further statement regarding my observations.

To the best of my knowledge, this incident was thoroughly investigated by the Air Force and determined to be of an unknown origin. No satisfactory explanation was ever provided for the bright light that I observed.

I hope this report provides the necessary details regarding the incident. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
DANIEL CHRISMAN

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match.

The image contains a diagram and some handwritten text, but no photograph. The diagram appears to be showing a sketch of an object or objects in the sky and the motion they made. The handwritten text below the diagram seems to be a description or response related to the diagram.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.
