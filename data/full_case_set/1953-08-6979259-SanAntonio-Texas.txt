The image contains a photographic depiction of what appears to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). The object is depicted as a dark silhouette against a lighter background. The image is accompanied by text, which I will extract verbatim below.

On Aug 5, 1953, I was working with Mr. [REDACTED] at the home of [REDACTED] on [REDACTED] in San Antonio, Texas, at about 1600 hrs. Mr. [REDACTED] called my attention to an object in the air, which was indistinguishable to the naked eye. I verify that the object gave off no trails, disintegration, or smoke, and that it remained in the sky for some time. It moved back and forth several times of an arc of about 180 degree can't be estimated, and it moved back and forth over me. I would say that the object was about the size of a B-29 and was it moved fast and was extremely fast in its motions.
I carefully that this statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

9 was standing at a 20 ft distance from the pile and saw a object at an altitude so low that I could not estimate its actual altitude. This object hovered over the area for about 3 to 5 minutes and then accelerated to a tremendous velocity and disappeared. I have sketched the appearance of the object on this page. The object had a triangular shape and a dull glow around its edges. It made no sound and all I could hear was the sound of the machinery from the pile.

30. Please mail the sketch. Use address:

STATEMENT

At approximately 0215 hours 22 August 1953, the undersigned sighted, west of my house, a reddish brown light without reflector or sound moving south in an erratic up and down motion across the sky, at approximately 1500 to 2000 feet altitude.

The natural speed is unknown, but it seemed to move fairly slowly. It appeared to be larger than a star and resembled a star.

About 5 seconds after I sighted this object, I called my wife, Irene Poley, for an observation, and we both had a visual observation of the object for approximately 4 seconds longer when it slowly disappeared behind the houses across the street, moving from south to east.

About 10 minutes later an aircraft was sighted flying a southwest path. He turned on his landing light which were easy to distinguish as landing lights. Also, he made the normal aircraft noises. About 5 minutes after this aircraft was sighted, another one was sighted flying from north to south, and this aircraft passed in front of houses, and was also heard.

METEOR
The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers who are studying meteors. Mariners reporting their observations of these bodies are greatly assisting in their studies. It is desired to have the observations as complete as possible, not only in reporting visual observations, but also by hearing of the time when they disappeared and any sound or explosion that may have accompanied them.
Complete observations on long-enduring trains and their direction of drift are of especial importance, as they determine wind direction in the upper air.

STATEMENT

On 5 Aug 53 while working as a _____________, home on San Antonio, Texas, I saw an unidentifiable object in the sky at about 1000 to 1015 hours. It appeared to be about the size of the bottom of a 5 1/2 tub and shaped like a silver. We saw no vapor trails or exhaust smoke, and didn't hear any sound of motors. It just hung in the sky for about 5 or 5 minutes with a white gray exhaust end. I was startled about 20 feet from a gin pole that I was working on and was looking to see if it was a strange. At an angle from my eyes, looking over a piece of rope a foot from the top of a 35 ft gin pole, I spotted this object. I called my office and asked what was happening, as we were home we working, they all stated they saw it. It was surprising to see this strange object hovering overhead with no apparent means of propulsion. I certainly that this statement is truthful and correct to the best of my knowledge.
