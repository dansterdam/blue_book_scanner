SUMMARY: (Verbal concise summary of report. This paragraph to be typed in two - inch text.)
Pane: A detailed report of an incident occurring at on 2 1953 which involved 4 Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). At on 2 May 1953 at the NEN RADAR Station located near Baltimore, Maryland, the radar operators observed four objects on their radar scopes which were traveling at an estimated speed of 1,000 mph. The objects were not shown to be aircraft and their movement indicated that they were not subject to atmospheric conditions. After observing the objects for some twenty minutes the operators notified Air Defense Command which in turn notified the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) located nearby. The OSI dispatched an officer who arrived at the radar station and was able to observe the objects visually as well as on the radar scope. An intensive search of the area was conducted and no planes or other normal aerial objects were found. The incident was reported to higher headquarters and the file was forwarded to Project Blue Book for further analysis.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD:
REFERENCE: Unidentified Objects
SUMMARY: Captain RYAN, Assistant Chief, ATIC reported: On 13 May 1955, the attached memo for record, dated 13 May 1955, subject "Unidentified Objects" was received.
All applicable data having bearing upon the objects viewed, as reported, are incorporated into this report as follows:
The two (2) pieces gave evidence of having been joined, perhaps now for a second time, one piece was approximately 2 3/4 inches long, the other was approximately 2 1/2 inches long. The total length was about 20 inches. A hole (not seen in the center) had been cut or made in the material. The edges were slightly curled in appearance, and if original and the pieces had never been joined, would have presented a more circular shape. The pieces had more obvious been reheated, and if original would have been edged or finished. It is considered the pieces or objects were part of some experimental or test material and were discarded.
The newspaper reporter (Mr. requested a picture stating there was parts of the routine investigation newspaper reports. His request was turned down as it was determined they believed the objects to be part of some experimental materials.

COMMENTS: (If narrative style, expand on your evaluation as checked above. Point out deviations and include pertinent guidance and related criticism.):

1. The two objects, which accompanied the report, were clearly examined by both the personnel and several specialists from the Dayton, Ohio, following the results of the analysis:

a. Characteristics of the objects:
(1) The two objects, weighing 13 3/4 and 1 1/2 lbs are definitely "A" grade quality cans from containing less than an addition in composition.
(2) From close examination it was found that the marking is not an old variety and tracers of corrosion indicate it had been installed more recently.
(3) The objects are "PROBABLY" from a larger valve control used on certain vessels, cranes regulating operating and/or water and sewerage systems.

(4) The hole located at the break on the ring-like piece was found to contain a considerable amount corrosion, suggesting that a former "handle-type" assembly was once installed there.

2. Possible cause of the incident - It is very difficult to determine what caused the incident; however, after consideration of various possibilities, the following conclusions were obtained:

(1) It is very unlikely that any aircraft in the area at the time could have dropped the particular pieces recovered. If the whole "object" had been dropped, it would have remained in one place until found.

THERE DID EXIST PAIR DROP CRASH:
Pipe That Crashed Through Roof Is Oil Plant Puzzle
A pipe that crashed through the roof of a home in Baltimore was the subject of a special investigation by Air Force officials. The pipe did not come from any aerial object or crash. It was a pipe that was being used at an American oil company plant and it became dislodged and crashed through the roof of a home. There is no indication that this incident is connected in any way to the reported sightings of unidentified flying objects in the area.
The official who is manager of the American Oil Company office in the "200 block" said he showed the chunk of mysterious metal to police in the Southern district, and they said it was the pipe that had been used at the plant and had broken off.

PARTS OF FLYING SAUCER
Mystery Surrounds Object from Oil Plant Roof

Perhaps there are parts of a flying saucer, police speculated today as they continued their investigation of a metal object that crashed through the roof of the American Oil Company plant in the 3,300 block of Boston Street last night.
The object, which appeared to be about two feet long, was discovered in the rear yard of the plant this morning, but the investigation is not progressing as rapidly as the police had hoped.
The object was cold when it crashed through the roof and didn't hurt anyone. The investigation continues, but the investigator said he didn't know what it was. He said they were trying to get it together to see what it is, but didn't have any idea. He did say that, whatever it was, it didn't come from the sky - somehow.
"Investigators" said it looked like the two should fit together, but they wouldn't venture to say what it was.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
Objy, examine the opinion of the Preparing Officer. The object was probably a small private aircraft or military training plane, when it was first noticed, but later, the heaviness of the metal preclude it being one. Although a check with Base Operations at F-15 indicates no such flights were noted, we feel it could easily have been a small private aircraft or military training plane in the area at the time.
As part of the aircraft, the fact that Mr. ____ heard an aircraft leaving the area at the time of the incident, helps confirm this theory.
Believe all persons mentioned, including Mr. ____ are telling the truth in what they stated about the observation of this unidentified object.

(1) A witness would have to possess a relatively high degree of physical and mental alertness to identify the unusual characteristics of the object that was observed. The witness was reportedly in a sober condition at the time of the observation, which adds to the reliability of the report.

(2) The logs contain a fairly detailed explanation of the phenomenon. The description indicates that the witness was able to observe the object for a relatively long period of time, which increases the validity of the information.

(3) The report is considered to have sufficient explanatory details that would enable a more complete analysis. However, the absence of any corroborating witnesses or evidence limits the certainty of the conclusion.

Based on the tentative conclusion made in paragraph (3) above, it is still the opinion that the report represents a valid sighting, and deserves further investigation. The lack of any "small-acting" features on that day indicates that this is the only logical explanation, and that the usual types of aerial phenomena can be excluded.

ATLAS-5 PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION 16 May 1955
CASE - 7 May 1955, Baltimore, Maryland
REPORT - AF Form 112, (U), 3F-UNON-5-52, dated 12 May 1955, 1st Lt 3-h, 4602d AISS, RAMDUS AFB, New Jersey.
NARRATIVE - 13 May 1955 - Investigator visited the location in Baltimore, Maryland, via air mail from Ft. 3-h, 4602d AISS RAMDUS AFB, New Jersey with two portable objects to interview several persons from the "Step Con, under the direction of an attempt to identify the two objects.
INTERVIEWS ACCOMPLISHED - 16 May 1955 - Visited the Dayton Forging Plant Treating Company and discussed the objects with Mr. _____, who stated that the objects were definitely a fairly good quality of cast iron, after conducting some physical tests and examinations. She stated that the objects appeared to be of an unusual nature or origin. No evidence of physical disturbance in the area where placed was apparent. The objects appeared to be of a very brittle nature and considerably different in certain characteristics when compared with ordinary cast iron. At one time, joined and were initially separated only by a thin connecting wire. At his estimation, the pieces were NOT of any physical disturbance to suggest contamination and the cylinder-like condition and cylindrical construction of the objects excited considerable interest and comment from those whom viewed them.
Mr. _____ readily answered all questions asked of him. He, was well educated and versed in the field of metallurgy.

According to the OCR output, the text found in the document is as follows:

1520 hrs. 16 May 1955 - Visited the 
property of Mr. S___, Arlington, Ohio.
The objects under investigation were reported as discs or saucer-shaped, metallic in appearance, hovering close to the ground, and apparently under intelligent control. The objects were 13 3/4 and 5 1/2 ft. in diameter, respectively, and were observed through field glasses from a distance of about 1,000 yards. They were bright white in color, and appeared to be rotating slowly on a vertical axis. The objects were observed for about 15 minutes and then ascended rapidly in a vertical direction, disappearing from sight.
The witness appeared to be a very well educated gentleman, and was having the practical background experience which enabled him to express himself fluently and thoroughly when asked specific questions by this investigator.
4. 1555 hrs. 16 May 1955 - Phoned in above information to Capt. Hardin, Project Monitor.
CONCLUSION
1. After reviewing the aforementioned statements and opinions together with the report, it is felt by this investigator that the incident can be summed up as follows:
A. Characteristics of the Objects
(1) The two objects, weighing 13 3/4 and 5 1/2 lbs., are definitely a good quality cast iron.
(2) From close examination it was found that the casting is of an old variety and traces of corrosion indicate it had been installed near water or in some other damp location.
(3) The objects are probably from a former valve control wheel.
(4) The hole located at the "break" on the 13-3/4-inch piece was found to contain a handle-type assembly which was once installed there. This was very similar to a handle used to remove such handles to lessen the possibility of accidental injury.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document from Project Blue Book. The document appears to be an incident report detailing the probable cause of an incident. The text in the document is as follows:

B. Probable Cause of the Incident

(1). It is extremely unlikely that any aircraft flying in the area at the time could have generated winds particular to this incident, if the whole wheel had been subjected to such winds, it would have been dislodged from the aircraft, rather than lodged in one side of the building. There were no other pieces found or recovered.

(2). The material could have caused a great amount of physical strength to have drawn it up and through the roof.

(3). If the objects had been part of a revolving mechanism of any kind, they could have entered the building in a more jagged direction, rather than the obvious vertical direction they fell in.

(4). Based upon close examination of the report and as a result of the investigation concluded, it is felt by the examining authorities that the skull-cracking operations and the objects penetrating through the roof of the building, notes skull-cracking to the building up of machinery and other instable objects into the air and back down, for undulating and re-cresting.

RECOMMENDATION
In line with conclusion (4) above, it is recommended that Capt. C. B. Hanson, USAF, Hq 3-4, be contacted and requested to check on the locations of operational commands conducting skull-cracking operations that may have resulted in any such calamities on 7 May 1955.
