34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 9-29-65
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: 
This message was received by my family Dr. Bruce on the eve of my birthday. My brain received the message through telepathy - the information from England. My brain received the message as of 6-17-57. I recall no total for anything, but I do follow as directed. My message was recorded and I advised no one of this but my physician Dr. Bruce and the local investigator. I did contact a local official on the 6-17-57 date, but I'm not positive just who it was. The UFO appeared suddenly at a high altitude and remained in view for about 10 minutes. It was saucer shaped, silver in color, and it seemed to be guided by an invisible force. There seemed to be some type of energy field around it. I felt a strong tingling sensation when viewing it. The UFO made no sound, but the air seemed to vibrate. It then moved rapidly out of sight.

I doubt slighter any air plane that I saw that night. The object was larger and not an airplane. It had a light on it and I observed it for some time. It moved faster than any plane I have ever seen.

The object appeared to be a very large vehicle with very bright lights around it an extremely bright light at a very high intensity at its base. The object appeared to be hovering at a very high altitude over the Esler Air Force Base near Alexandria City. As the object maneuvered it appeared to change shape. It was observed for several minutes and then accelerated away at a very high speed and disappeared from view.

The image appears to contain a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch shows a compass rose and some graphical elements representing the movement of an object or objects. The text seems to be instructions or questions related to the sketch, but does not describe any photographic evidence.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place a "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (by line). Place a "B" on the same curved line to show the azimuth (direction) from which you (first) saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
