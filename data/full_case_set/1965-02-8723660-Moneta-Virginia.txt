MR DUFAUL:
UNCLAS 64900P-00015, 2 FEB 65, FINAL SECTION OF TWO SECTIONS.
CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA - SIGHTING OF A LARGE BRIGHT LIGHT,
APPARENTLY FALLING FROM THE SKY OVER COLUMBIA, SC ON 17 DEC 62.

PAGE 2 DUFAML, 4 UNCLAS
NORTH OF CHARLOTTE, NC, A CRAFT WAS TRACKING EAST AND THE OTHER WEST. BOTH AIRCRAFT LEFT CONTRAILS AND THEIR FEATURES WERE EASILY DISCERNIBLE AS STANDARD AIRCRAFT TYPES WHEN VIEWED THROUGH THE BINOCULARS. HOWEVER, NOT ALL DETAILS OF THE CRAFT COULD BE OBSERVED, WHEN VIEWED THROUGH THE BINOCULARS.
MR. AND MRS.  HAVE OBSERVED UNUSUAL LIGHTS, SUCH AS A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT HOVERING SILENTLY FOR A LONG PERIOD SIGHTING THE NEXT DAY. MORE LIGHTS AND SEE ONLY ON THE NIGHTS PRIOR TO A SIGHTING. HE HAS MENTIONED THESE OBSERVATIONS TO SOME OF HIS FRIENDS DURING THE DAY.
(2) AS IN PREVIOUS SIGHTINGS BY MR. , I WILL MAKE NO EFFORT TO ASCRIBE ANY CASUAL IDENTITY AS TO THE OBJECT. IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT AN INVESTIGATING TEAM BE SENT TO CONTACT MR. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AS HIS UNIT ARE OF SUFFICIENT DURATION OF ACTIVITY TO JUSTIFY A MORE COMPLETE ANALYSIS THAN HAS ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED FOR PREVIOUS SIGHTINGS.
