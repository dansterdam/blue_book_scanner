There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a UFO report document with questions and spaces for handwritten responses.

As an OCR system, the text I can extract from this document is:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
DISAPPEARED BEHIND TREES - EAST - CAST

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and a curved line labeled "B" to demonstrate how high the observed object was above the horizon (skyline) when it was first seen. The second sketch shows two larger sketches: one depicting a person standing on a road with buildings and hills in the background, and another smaller sketch showing a similar landscape with a curved horizon line.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.
