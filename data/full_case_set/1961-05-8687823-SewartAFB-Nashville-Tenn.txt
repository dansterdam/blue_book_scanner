The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter addressed to "Dr. William T. Coleman, Public Information Division, Department of the Air Force, Washington, D.C." from "Nashville 14, Tennessee" and dated "June 25, 1961".

The letter discusses a sighting of a balloon over Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee on June 27, 1961. It states that the balloon was sighted over Memphis at 2:00 p.m. and over Nashville at around 3:00 p.m., reaching an altitude of 50,000 feet or more. The letter says the Nashville, Tennessee Civil Defense called the incident a "routine weather balloon" and that a local TV station employee positively identified the object as a weather balloon. The letter concludes by stating that the writer would like to know the Air Force's assessment of the incident.

Transcribing the text:

Dear Sir,

Thank you for your letter of June 25th.

You shall attempt to be more explicit regarding the sighting you reported to the Air Force Technical Observer on this same date.

Your letter does not contain a description of an aerial phenomenon which you observed, and which would be classified as an Unidentified Flying Object. It appears that you are merely describing the operation of a series of weather balloons that were released from the field at Sewart AFB on June 23rd.

The release of these balloons is a normal routine operation in the Department of Defense, and is not considered a matter of intelligence interest. From two to twelve balloons of various configurations are launched daily from this and other Air Force installations. The diameter of even the smaller balloons is so high it exceeds five feet, and the balloons are generally high altitude devices intended for upper atmosphere research and instrumentation. They are classified as unmanned, non-operational balloons and serve a variety of scientific purposes. Their release is in no way connected with any unusual or unidentified aerial activity.

Since your letter does not describe any aerial phenomenon which could be considered an Unidentified Flying Object, I am unable to take any further action. If you have observed something in the sky which you believe to be of intelligence interest, I would appreciate a more detailed account, including the date, time, location, direction of travel, size, color, shape, and duration of the sighting. Only then could this office properly evaluate the matter.

I trust this explanation clarifies the situation. Please feel free to write again if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,

REQUEST FOR 1970 ANALYSIS
 
TO: AFNIC (Major Coleman)
AITTN: Mr. D. C.

1. ATIC received a letter from Mr. about reporting the sighting of a UFO and requested analysis. The case was reported by STEWART AFB Nashville, Tenn.

2. On 23 MAY 1961, Jackie Creek Radio, located about 25 miles north of Nashville, Tennessee, at an altitude of 1,200 feet, spotted a high altitude northwesterly object through a telescope and positively identified the object through a telescope as a balloon. The object was so high it could no longer be seen with the naked eye. The Air Force pilots, while flying at 47,000 feet, saw the object and confirmed that it was far enough below them so that they could no longer see it with the naked eye.

3. ATIC has confirmed the object was probably the high altitude balloon Department of Commerce approved. This confirms STEWART AFB analysis. COORDINATION: ATIN-4-CB/DAMES C. COLEMAN/CAPT USAF DATE: 18 JUNE 1961

REPORT - TECHNICAL CENTER
Arm AFCIN-4Xb
ATTENTION AIR FORCE CASE 8228

Dear Sir:

On 7 May 19G1, there appeared a large triangular-shaped object over Sewart Air Force Base near Nashville, Tennessee. This object was observed by several pilots and control tower officials. They said there was no record of anything like this object being over the base at that time.

Some of the pilots said that when they looked at the object, it looked like it was about one mile in diameter and they said it had lights around the outside edge and that it appeared to be hovering over the area. They also said it made no sound and was at an altitude of around 47,000 feet.

The object disappeared from view and the pilots said that the object was at 50,000 - one military officer said that he did not know what the object was. Evidently this object did not belong to the U.S. Could it have been an unidentified flying object? This occurrence took place at 4:40 p.m. and 5:20 p.m. on 7 May 1961. The object was over Memphis, Tennessee at 4:40 p.m. and Nashville at 5:20 p.m.

Will you please give me the explanation? I anxiously await your reply.

Yours truly,
[Redacted]

Request for UFO Analysis

FM: CADO 
REPORT: CADO 55-2 (Major Coleman) 
WABASHING-TON, D.C.

SYNOPSIS: 

A UFO was sighted by several observers over Nashville, Tennessee, 20 May 1961. It was reported that a balloon was at high altitude northeast of Nashville. The balloon was on a slow drift northward. When the sun was far enough below the horizon, the object began to glow, making a rapid climb and then disappearing. The object and flight pattern appeared to be a balloon.

The report states the object was observed by rocket range-radio crew of Sewart AFB, Tennessee. This activity is substantiated by radio messages from the ground console (and eye witness testimony) describing illuminated flight patterns consistent with a balloon.

20 JUNE 1961

Dear Mr. ---------

Your letter of 26 June was addressed to the attention Technical Information Branch and has been referred to me.

ATIC has investigated the sighting you reported. based on all the information available, thie sighting was probably of a natural phenomenon.

JAKE SANK (was radio. incident of nautical diver equipment. SUBJECT SANK RADIO). SUBJECT SANK BELOW SAID UNABLE TO GET BACK ON SURFACE account DIVER EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION. SUBJECT NOT INVOLVED OBJECT SIGHTING.

ATIC investigation is that the object you saw nothing unusual, more than likely the planet Mars. This time of year, Mars is frequently mistaken for a "flying saucer" by the uninformed.

The possibility of this being an actual extraterrestrial vehicle is extremely remote and unwarranted. The balloons which are frequently mistaken for "flying saucers" are not related to any aspect of national security.

I hope this information is helpful.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN
