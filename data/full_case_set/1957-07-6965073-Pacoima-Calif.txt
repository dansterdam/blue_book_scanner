The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old news publication with a section titled "Books of the Week" that provides brief descriptions of various books.

Books of the Week 
For the informed information of our readers, books received for review are listed here with brief comment. Included in this week's list are:

Under the Palmetto - A novel by Evelyn Scott. "This is a book which will attract wide attention on its publication. The author, who has written several distinguished novels, here gives us a picture of life in South Carolina which, in its finely wrought detail and its mature understanding, is reminiscent of the best work of Ellen Glasgow."

The Curious Myth of the Happy Warrior - By G. Wilson Knight. "Here is a bold and original interpretation of the heroic tradition in English poetry from the Elizabethans to Wordsworth, The author rejects the accepted views on the nature of the "happy warrior" as conceived by such poets as Spenser, Milton and Wordsworth, and expounds a different and provocative thesis."

The Forgotten Village - By John Steinbeck. "This volume, with 136 photographs by Herbert Kline, tells the story of a Mexican village and the superstitions, traditions, and conflicts of its people as they accept modern ways of living."

The Challenge of the Atom - By William L. Laurence. "This book by the distinguished science writer of The New York Times contains a lucid and authoritative account of the developments in atomic energy and tells what it means to the world."

E FIELDS
Technique Makes
Injection Painless
TECHNIQUE MAKES INJECTION PAINLESS

FIELDS, E.
Dr. James Trevett, a dentist, reports that by
using a new technique of local anesthesia he
is able to make injections completely painless.
Dr. Trevett explains that by using a low-
frequency, high-intensity electrical field he is
able to override the pain receptors in the
local area of the injection and reduce the
discomfort felt by the patient.
The article notes that this technique is effec-
tive and safe, and that Dr. Trevell has used it
in thousands of cases without any adverse
effects. It is described as a major advance in
making dental injections painless.

Time Filled With
Doctors Report

DANGER, DOCTORS
DANGER, DOCTORS The real problem,
say medical men, is not physical injury but
rather the psychological trauma caused by
fear of the risk involved. Many of the reported
ill effects, they say, stem from this anxiety and
are not the result of radiation or other hazards.
The field has been learned by many doctors to
be a hazard-filled area and most are reluctant to
enter it, even with what they consider adequate
protection. They feel the risks are too great.
The article concludes that more research is
needed to determine the true dangers and to
develop better protective equipment and
procedures.

FTC Questions
Advertising Industry
FTC QUESTIONS ADVERTISING INDUSTRY

It wants to determine just what is claimed in
ads and how much the public really believes.

The article states that the Federal Trade
Commission is currently investigating the
advertising industry to determine what claims
are being made in ads and how much the
public really believes those claims.

The main questions the FTC wants answered
are: 1) What do advertisers actually claim in
their ads? and 2) To what extent do consumers
believe those claims?

The article notes that the FTC feels some
advertisers may be making exaggerated or
misleading claims that the public does not
fully realize are not true. The investigation
aims to gather data on the accuracy of ad
claims and the public's perception of them.

The goal is to better understand the effect of
advertising on consumer behavior and decision-
making. The FTC hopes this will inform future
regulation of the advertising industry.

Bladder Can Be
Grown Around Balloon

BLADDER CAN BE GROWN AROUND BALLOON

The article discusses a new medical technique
where a patient's own cells are used to grow a
new bladder around an implanted balloon. 

Researchers have found that by inserting a
deflated balloon into the patient's abdominal
cavity and allowing the patient's own cells to
grow around it over several months, a new
functional bladder can be created.

Once the new bladder has fully formed, the
balloon is then deflated and removed, leaving
behind the patient's own engineered bladder
tissue.

The article states this approach avoids the need
for donors or synthetic materials, and allows the
body to naturally grow its own replacement
bladder. It is seen as a promising new technique
for bladder reconstruction and replacement.

The image contains a photograph of a star chart showing the positions of Jupiter and Saturn in the night sky. The text accompanying the image discusses how Jupiter and Saturn will be brighter in the night sky during the month of July 1955.

Jupiter and Saturn Rule Skies
Jupiter and Saturn will be brighter than the other visible planets in the July skies, while Vega, in the constellation Lyra, will be the brightest star seen at this time.
By James Stokley
During the month of July the two major planets, Jupiter and Saturn, will dominate the evening skies, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory. 
Jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky, after the moon and Venus. Saturn is next, being the fifth brightest object. These two giant planets will be very prominent this month, easily visible to the naked eye as they travel across the southern sky during the evening hours.
As the month progresses, Jupiter will become steadily brighter, reaching a maximum brightness on July 25. Saturn, too, will increase in brightness during the month, but not to the same extent as Jupiter. 
The star Vega, in the constellation Lyra, will be the brightest star in the July skies, outshining all the others. Vega is one of the three stars that make up the "Summer Triangle" along with Altair and Deneb.
Double-Double Star
A nice double-double star for the telescope is Epsilon Lyrae, in the constellation Lyra, just a few degrees from Vega. This star, like Sirius, the Dog Star, appears single to the naked eye, but a small telescope reveals it to be a double star, and a larger telescope shows that each of these two stars is also a double.

On July 23, 1957, at 8:00 p.m., a witness reported seeing an unidentified flying object over Pacoima, California. The object was described as a very bright light that hovered for several minutes before suddenly disappearing. The witness checked for any aircraft in the area but could not find any. The report was submitted by Douglass Nooning, 6117 Causeway Drive, Riverside 29, California.
