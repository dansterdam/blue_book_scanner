Subject: Pilot's report of "Flying Saucer" vicinity UB.

Dear Sir:

I though you would be interested in the attached report, even
though it probably has no meteorological significance.

Mr. [REDACTED] related the following additional details in a conver-
sation immediately after the reported flight. He and the co-
pilot first sighted the "saucer" ahead of them and at about
the same altitude at which they were flying. It was in sil-
houette against a brilliant evening sky and they, being unable
to determine at first in which direction it was moving, pulled
up to about 1200 ft. to avoid possible collision. In this new
position they could determine that the object was moving away
from them and at a very rapid rate. It appeared to be as large
or larger, in mass, as a C-54 and black in color. It maneu-
vered in the same altitude but soon disappeared from sight because
of its superior speed, which the pilots estimated roughly to
be three times theirs.

I know Mr. [REDACTED] well and he is not the imaginative type.

Respectfully,

/s/ R. Allen Showalter

Capt ██████ and his Copilot ██████ stated that on 4 Aug at sunset they sighted and followed a "flying saucer" northwest of Bethel, Alaska. The object which appeared as eleven or larger in size than a C-54 and 
blue in color appeared silhouetted against a brilliant evening sky in 
order to avoid a possible collision (being unable at first to determine in what direction the object was moving) they reversed their DC3 at
in order to avoid possible collision. The object crossed their path at 
right angles to them. Seeing that it was moving away from them at a very rapid rate and flying at an altitude of from 500 to 1,000 ft they swung in behind it and followed it at an air speed of 170 MPH but the thing was out of sight in four minutes. They state the object was smooth-surfaced and streamlined and resembled somewhat a C-54 without motors (from the rear) and was without wings or any reliable means of propulsion whatever. Wind was negligible and it was on a NW course.

Official in Charge of the Airlines for which ██████ was working states that the pilot is not the "imaginative type".

with 14L incidents thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four
which contain some evidence that is regarded as more positive.
The observations and any conclusions are provisional, and evidence is
regarded as tentative and uncertain. When psychological and physical
medical factors were taken into consideration, all of these sightings
as explained rationally as pointed out in Reel Operations
Boxes in the Tactical Command Archives, Langley Air Force
Base, Va.

[...] (not translated)
(Psychological; continued)

This was sufficient psychological explanations for them
unidentified flying objects to provide plausible compliance though
parts not otherwise explainable. This errors in identifying real
familiar results chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance or
size.

All of these remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail in next
reports. These incidents form no pattern in regards to time of
sightings or whether or not the presence. There are individual
sense, but in no single case was a hoax indicted by the report nor was
substantially held it is veen arstified a visual or aural

Incident No. 56 — 4 August 1947, Sunset, near Bethel, Alaska.

A pilot and his co-pilot observed a black object of the design and approximate dimensions of a C-54, Fuselage, flying at 300-XXX feet altitude. The object crossed their path at right angle, and they pulled up to 1200 ft to avoid a collision, when object did the same, and lost sight of it in four minutes. They estimated the speed of object to be 300 miles per hour, due to the short existing distance one: if speed to be correct, elimantary calculations deduce- Assuming the estimates of traveled as 35 miles in four minutes while the observers aerplane moved eleven miles in the same period. Therefore, the object was more than twenty miles distant when last seen. To be capable of being seen at this distance under the conditions given, the object would have to be about 50 feet in its smallets or end-on dimension. If this were true, and the object was proportionate with a C-54 fuselage, its lentgh would be about 300 Ft. Assuming the estimate of speed to be incorrect, but time in sight to be correct, the object is figured in reverse, visan, as a reasonable width to 50 ft. in aerplane the point would have been less than ten miles away when lost to view; it therefore, would have traveled about eighteen miles in four minutes, giving a speed of less than 300 MPH.

A.C. Opinion: It is believed that the pilots were suddenly startled by a conventional aircraft crossing their path, and that as they gave chase to this aircraft which was "silhouetted against a brilliant evening sky", they were partially blinded, and were therefore unable to discern wings or engines.

There are no photographs present in this image, just marked redaction lines where text or images have been covered and obscured. Below is the text present in the document:

Incident 568 -- NW of Bethel, Alaska -- 4 August 1947 

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.
The time in sight (four minutes) and rate of speed (520 MPH) seem
to preclude any such possibilities.

The similarity of this incident to #10, in which several
objects were seen silhouetted against a sunset, is striking.

UNCLASSIFIED COPY

BETHEL, ALASKA

5 August 1947

Subject: Matters of National Interest

To: Commanding Officer, Alaska Communication System
550 Federal Office Building, Seattle 4, Washington

1. Per AGAO-S 319.1 the following report is submitted on a matter which may become of national interest. Captain [redacted] and his CoPilot [redacted] have stated that on August 4, 1947 they sighted and followed a flying saucer Northwest of Bethel Alaska. This object was bigger than the Douglas DC-3 they were flying, crossed their course at right angles to them. It was flying at an altitude of one thousand feet. They swung in behind it and followed it at a air speed of one hundred seventy miles per hour but it was out of sight in four minutes. They state the object was smooth surfaced and streamlined with no visible means of propulsion whatsoever.

2. It is realized that the Fourth Air Force claims there are no such things but Captain [redacted] is Chief Pilot for [redacted] flying service and is not a man given to exaggeration. In view of the excellent reputation of Captain [redacted] and the fact that no one here doubts in the least but that he actually saw this object, this report is turned in for any action deemed necessary by your offices.
