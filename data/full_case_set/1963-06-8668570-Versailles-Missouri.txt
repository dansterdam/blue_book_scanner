A SUBSEQUENT TELEPHONE CALL, THE RELIABILITY OF [REDACTED] AND IN OBTAINING THE WEATHER DATA FROM WILLIAMSBURG OFFICERS SUGGESTED IT COULD HAVE BEEN A WEATHER BALLOON WITH A LIGHT. THIS WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE TWENTY MINUTE SIGHTING, ZIG-ZAGGING AND SPEED-UP AND SLOW-DOWN. THIS COULD ALSO ACCOUNT FOR THE BRIGHT, THEN DIM, LIGHT AS THE INSTRUMENT PACKAGE WAS SWINGING UNDER THE BALLOON.
