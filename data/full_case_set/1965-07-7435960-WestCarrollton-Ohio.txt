The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch shows a horizon line with an object above it, and a compass-like symbol in the bottom right corner.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the current line to show how high the subject was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same current line to show how high the subject was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass to show the direction from which the subject came and the direction in which it went.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
