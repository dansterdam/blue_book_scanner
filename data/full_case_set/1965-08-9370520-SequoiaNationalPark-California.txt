Dear Mr. ------

If your direction of flight is correct, the object which you observed on 24 August 1965 was in a position opposite to the known satellite flight.
Since you observed an interested flight, I am enclosing a list of the visible satellites and space debris.

Sincerely,

MR. WW CHAUNCEY an object which he assumed to be a satellite. The object was observed between 12 - 15 August while on a trip to the Sequoia National Park, California. On the third night of the flight, it is likely that the object observed was not a satellite, as known satellite orbits have been checked and do not coincide with the observation. All known satellites are listed in THE OBSERVER'S HANDBOOK, and the observation was made on succeeding nights. It is, therefore, unlikely that the observed object was a known satellite.

We are attaching a list of the visible satellites observed and noted.

Ge Sterling:
While on a recent trip myself and five friends spotted 4 luminous objects in the sky which we believe to be satellite passing over. 
It was sighted on Wednesday, August 25, Thursday August 26, and Friday August 27 from 8:40pm to 11:30pm each evening. It was moving very rapidly from northwest to southeast, and seemed to change both color and direction at times. It was about the size of a star and remained visible from 3 to 10 minutes each night. We feel quite certain that these were not stars or satellites as we are all familiar with their appearance. They were much brighter and moved with a speed far exceeding any satellite I have ever seen. 
It is my wish that this report be added to your files for whatever interest it may have.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
