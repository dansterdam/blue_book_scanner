SUBJECT: Statement of I    On unidentified Airbourne Objects seen and observed October 27th 1952.

TO: Lt. Arthur W. Fyde
Chief, Technical Services Branch
Dugway Proving Ground

On the Day of 27th October 1952, at 0800, while A companion of the named    who resides at Salt Lake City, and I were in the process of deer hunting in the Vicinity of Hickman Canyon's, Tooele County, Utah, we observed an object flying toward us and about the altitude of 3,000 feet, which was immediately and rapidly followed by another object. As the object reached its closest point I called in the past flying saucers. The object and I followed the object with our eyes until the object disappeared beyond the mountain terrain. Details are as follows:

The object was first detected to work around a knoll. It was in a North westerly direction and I in A south westerly direction we had agreed to meet a gain on the South side of this knoll. However, when I got back to the right of this knoll the object was there again. I put the telescope I had mounted on an 06 rifle and followed its flight course which passed uncommon and drew its sight on its flight line. It then read 110 Degrees Easting by proven 290 Degrees west. In a perfect semicircle flight it descended and climbed again over and over until I heard no more. It flew until almost out of sight, But nevertheless the sound was still there. I checked my compass reading a straight line from its original startin? position looking for any additional activity. and saw none.

After the object disappeared Miss    for about four minutes before we could continue our search. She stated that the object was formed like A Sugar with A dark spot in the middle. Altho where I was I looked at the object that way it appeared very bright with the most intense light that lit up the area. Just before the object started sticking out in the same direction that it was traveling, there were some lines of ome type of sticks which looked to be broken in the forward position. Observation could be guns broken by these type sticks put in the forward position. But at the time of observation no activity such as smoke or fire or vapor was seen. But I could not tell whether it was spinning or not. Approximately one half of the observation was gained in miles and another half in relation A car window destroyer running at high speed.

SUBJECT: Continued statement of On unidentified Airborne object seen and observed October 27th, 1952.
After again looking around for unusual activity in the area, I returned to Salt Lake City and talked to Lt. Pyne and Gillette and observed an Unidentified object climbing at a tremendous rate of speed. I called personnel and we watched this aerial phenomenon together.
As positive of - and sure her co secrecy until I could place the facts with personnel. As secrecy and cooperation could not be assured on my part, I discontinued any further search. Lt. Pyne however, I was not sure enough of the names of who I had previously arranged for. However I was instructed to cease my own personal search as well. I went alone and searched the area Tuesday wed. and Friday October 29-30; 7 then made appearances to the Lake more help in the area of November 2nd and more to secrecy when.
And we continued the search Tuesday 11th and we were searching and made a half circle and continued in a northwesterly direction. However, no good an unrecoverable attempt to photograph it. For the people mentioned. at exactly 1,000 AFore mentioned people were spread out about a distance of four miles and waited in silence or kind of listened. It slowly it as and came over the south mountains and showed them. However without any kind of a sound for about five minutes and during that time faded out and came in again. No explanation could be advanced by any of the observers as to what the object seemed to be like. It was decided that it was just South west of these mountains where Miss wild said it came over the crest. However on the final cessation of the noise nothing developed in talking with Lt. Pyne and Intelligence. I hope to convey that thought that air traffic of the area I am sure I can do it without to such an extent to civil authorities as possible. For all I the suggest to civil authorities.

STATEMENT OF: Lt. Arthur M. Ryle, Chief, Utah Facilities, Section, Logistical Services Division Technical Operations, Dugway Proving Ground, Utah
3 November 1952

SUBJECT: Statement of an unidentified airborne object observed in Hickman Canyon, Utah on 27th October 1952.

TO: Lt. Arthur V. Ryle,
Chief, Utah Facilities Section, Logistical Services Division
Technical Operations, Dugway Proving Ground.

On the Day of 27th October 1952, at 0800, while a companion and I were in the process of deer hunting in the vicinity of Hickman Canyon, a canyon on the county route between Stockton and Grantsville, Utah, I observed an object hovering in the sky at an altitude of 3,000 feet. The object was immediately recognized as unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. It appeared to be metallic, circular or disc-shaped, and was suspended motionless in the sky for several minutes, after which it began to move in a westerly direction. As it proceeded, it appeared to accelerate and rapidly disappeared in the distance.

While I was watching the object and I had attempted to work around a knoll, the westerly direction and I in a northerly direction in regards to the object in order to get a better view. Before I had come to the point where I thought I might be able to see it, the object abruptly stopped, hesitated momentarily, and then took off at a fantastic speed, climbing directly upwards until the object seem to fly in the mountain tentatively identified as south mountain and was lost to view.

I in company with my companion and I immediately reported our observations with nine for record. She insisted that she had the object three or four times before she saw it and assumed that it was a small aircraft approaching. However, when the object came into view, it was not an aircraft, but rather like a saucer with a dark color in the middle. Although there was no sound and all that was observed was the silhouette of the object against the sky, it appeared to be a solid metallic object traveling at a tremendous speed.

There was no illusion as to size, shape, speed, or altitude, and I am confident in my observation, until the object was lost from view. I checked the compass reading again and again and saw none. The compass apparently was not disturbed by the presence of the object. I watched the object through 15 to 20 seconds and I am convinced that what I saw was not a meteor or any conventional aircraft, but rather some type of flying saucer or other type of unidentified flying object.

Mr ****** ******* reported the following:

On get 22tat 1952 a reported to the ****** at ****** Air Force Base that a **** observed this object hovering over this area for several minutes. The object then made an extremely rapid departure straight up into the air.

He stated that it did not so much as make a sound. The object appeared to be 150 to 200 feet in diameter and had a very intense bluish white color. The observed the object for several minutes and then it made this extremely rapid vertical takeoff and disappeared from sight.

I request that this investigation do everything possible to verify this sighting and to determine the nature of the object that was observed. It is certainly most urgent that we determine what this object was and from whence it came. This sighting is of utmost importnnce and I shall appreciate a very prompt and thorough investigation of it.

The above case is so incredible and the consequences so evident that I have no choice but to insist to the fullest upon a complete and penetrating inquiry. I do not feel that I can conscientiously pass this case along without the most rigorous examination that can be conducted. 'This sighting appears to me to be of highest priority and importance and I would appreciate your personal interest and attention to it.

"Unidentified flying object in the air in the vicinity of Hickman Canyon county of Tooele, state of Utah.

TO: Mr. Reau F. Wineglow, Chief, Intelligence Division, Air Technical Intelligence Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio.

SUBJECT:

On Oct 28th 1952, I reported to Lt. R.W. Pflock, of the Highway Patrol, that I had a so-called 'Unidentified Flying Object' under observation, and he turn stated that he related the findings to Lt. Dennison, the assistant Executive Officer of that Intelligence Division. He further stated that the finding would be submitted to the Pentacle and Calvert, who cooperated on that case. I also surrendered a two pages report on the circumstances and the results of our search sighed by my companion and myself, with the assurance that it would be forwarded to your office. I asked permission to make your people and the citizens interested in the grounds that I would have this for my justification, in case this should not get out of the valley without being known. However the show has now stopped by investigation for the present time. I was granted permission to search the area from an aircraft based at Dugway which we did without success because the area is so densely covered with Deseret shrubs which obstacles the visibility that the object has disappeared. However the other evidence that I have gathered would be enough to convince the officers in that case, and I have now finished my search. So with your permission and in regards to Air Force Security, any information on the subject that you have and are forward to me without impeding the security that is involved can be of help in my search. I will continue as soon as the weather breaks and I am confident that I may be the close observer that may be the best everyone has been hiding for any information on likelihood of the situation or possibility of what actually transpired which would be very helpful and appreciated. Reliable evidence appears to a point to a spectacular happening according to hear from other sources that remains unavailing."
