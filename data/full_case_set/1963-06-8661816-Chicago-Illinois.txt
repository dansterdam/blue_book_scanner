Dear Editor,

     I reported some unidentified flying objects. it was in the year of 1963, and the month was August.

On August 16, 1963, Friday night at about 10:00 p.m. all of my neighbors were sitting outside and commented on some unusual objects they were observing through my telescope. Looking at the objects through my telescope when I suddenly saw them disappear. Between 10:45 and 11:05 at night, I saw distinctive circular objects. My boy friends had also seen them also.

I also recalled the motrotomer, or the "aalen", planetarium - a large, quite motionless, thing - that is that it would be only seen if possible atmospheric conditions, although visually. It had been covered.
