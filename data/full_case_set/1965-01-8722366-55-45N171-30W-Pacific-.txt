The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typewritten text describing a police chief's view of a UFO sighting. The text states that the police chief and his group observed a UFO for 15 minutes, and attempted to obtain binoculars to get a closer look, but the UFO then moved away.

Here is the text from the document:

Police Chief View; UFO
On January 2nd 1965, Police Chief Jr. and 3 other men in the UFCC located Group headquarters observed a UFO in the sky for 15 minutes and attempted to obtain binoculars to get a closer look. They stated they were able to see details of the craft such as a silvery, metallic exterior and lights around the edge. When they attempted to obtain binoculars the UFO moved away. They were unable to obtain binoculars and when they returned the object had disappeared. The time of the sighting was 4:30 p.m.
