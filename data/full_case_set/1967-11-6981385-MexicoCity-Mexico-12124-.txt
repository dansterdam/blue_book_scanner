Mexico City, Mexico
12 November 1967

At approximately 8:20 PM on 12 November 1967, the observer sighted a bright object in the sky over Mexico City, Mexico. The object was described as appearing to be "flashing" or pulsating in brightness. It was orange-red in color and appeared to be round or oval in shape. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes before it faded from view.

This report was received as part of Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying object (UFO) reports.

The image appears to show an illuminated statue or monument against a dark, night sky. The monument has a winged figure or angel-like shape on top, and it is surrounded by a hazy, bright light or glow. This seems to be a black and white photograph, likely taken at night, capturing the striking, dramatic visual of the lit-up monument standing out against the dark background.

CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE SECOND KIND
THE UNEXPLAINED CASE'S FROM PROJECT BLUEBOOK

On 6 November 1967, an unusual sighting occurred in Mexico City, Mexico. Several witnesses claimed to have seen a strange luminous object hovering over the city's central plaza, in the area of the Monumento a la Independencia (The Angel of Independence).

According to the official report, the object was described as a large, glowing white mass, approximately 40-50 feet in diameter, that hovered silently over the plaza for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view. No physical trace evidence was found at the site.

The incident was investigated by the Mexican Air Force, and the case was subsequently forwarded to the United States Air Force's Project Blue Book for further analysis. However, no definitive explanation for the sighting was ever determined.

This case represents a close encounter of the second kind, as the witnesses reported a clear, prolonged observation of an anomalous aerial phenomena that exhibited characteristics beyond the capabilities of known aircraft or atmospheric phenomena. The lack of physical evidence or a satisfactory conventional explanation contributed to the ongoing mystery surrounding this incident.

BLUE BOOK

The Mexican Saucer Incident 
6981385
11 NOVEMBER 1967

The following case report was extracted from Project Blue Book files.

LOCATION: Mexico City, Mexico
DATE: 6 November 1967
TIME: 2100 (local)

SUMMARY:
At approximately 2100 hours on 6 November 1967, four Mexican Air Force pilots observed and photographed an unidentified flying object over Mexico City. The object was described as a metallic, disc-shaped craft, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, that hovered silently over the city for several minutes before accelerating straight up at an estimated speed of 1,800 mph and disappearing from sight. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE UFO:
The UFO was described as a metallic, disc-shaped object approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. It was observed to hover silently over Mexico City for several minutes before accelerating straight up at an estimated speed of 1,800 mph and disappearing from sight.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ENCOUNTER:
Four Mexican Air Force pilots were on a routine training flight over Mexico City when they observed the unidentified flying object. The pilots were able to get close enough to the object to take several photographs before it accelerated and disappeared. According to the pilots' statements, the object appeared to be under intelligent control.

CONCLUSION:
This case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The four Mexican Air Force pilots provided credible eyewitness accounts, as well as photographic evidence, of the unidentified flying object they observed over Mexico City. Given the described characteristics and performance of the object, as well as the reliable nature of the witnesses, this incident warrants classification as an UNIDENTIFIED case.

OCR TEXT:
THE OBJECT HAS A WING-LIKE STRUCTURE AT THE TOP, AND IS ILLUMINATED BY A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT COMING FROM BELOW. THE SURROUNDINGS APPEAR TO BE DARK, INDICATING THIS IS A NIGHTTIME SCENE. THE BRIGHTNESS AND SHAPE OF THE LIGHT EMISSION SUGGESTS THIS IS LIKELY A ROCKET OR MISSILE LAUNCH, THOUGH THE SPECIFIC NATURE OF THE OBJECT IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR FROM THIS IMAGE ALONE.
