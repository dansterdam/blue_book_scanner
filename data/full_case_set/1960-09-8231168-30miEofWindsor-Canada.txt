The report indicates that on September 20, 1960 around 11:11 hrs, the witness observed a bright light in the sky which suddenly accelerated and changed direction. The light was observed for several minutes before disappearing. The report states that the object was cigar-shaped and estimated to be about 30 feet long. It also indicates that the witness was an air traffic controller.

Dear Sir:
Your letter dated 9-8-60, concerning an unidentified flying object was drawn to my attention.
This is highly probable that as you observed a bright object hovering stationary for a period your observation was a satellite, which many persons confuse with unidentified flying objects. The object you were - sighted would most likely be a known satellite, its appearance and behavior accurately described by Astronomical information which is available. Meteors become visible when they enter the earth's atmosphere and trail light and flame between their point of entry and disappearance. This can be explained as a natural atmospheric phenomena and seen by many observers.
I must caution you that your visioinal perception may not always be correctly interpreted, especially in dealing with objects at a distance, and whose speed and behavior between minimum and maximum limits is difficult to determine accurately. Weather conditions, lighting factors and the observer's own frame of reference are factors often overlooking in evaluating the nature of such objects. I trust this explanation will assist you in your future observations.
Sincerely,
LAURENCE J. TABON

APRIL 25-27.166 
UPO SIGHTING (Mr. [REDACTED])
CAR JR-22 (Solace records)
STATEMENT MADE TO MAJ. [REDACTED] OF ATIC

This is a preliminary report concerning Mr. [REDACTED]'s sighting of an unidentified flying object, and I will try to give you the highlights of the information as obtained from him in an interview conducted telephonically from this office.

Mr. [REDACTED] states that on April 25,1966, he was driving his car along Highway No. 3, approximately 30 miles east of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, when he sighted an unidentified flying object. The object was first sited by Mr. [REDACTED] at about 11:20 PM as an extremely bright light moving in the sky. At first he thought it might be an aircraft or a satellite, but as he continued to observe the object, he noticed that it was not following the normal flight pattern of an aircraft, and that it was much too bright and large to be a satellite. The object was observed to be moving in a horizontal path across the sky, occasionally varying its speed, and at times appearing to hover.

Mr. [REDACTED] states that as he continued to watch the object, he noticed that it appeared to give off flashes of light, like bursts of flame, at irregular intervals. He also stated that it seemed to change colors, from white, to orange, to red. The object was observed for a period of approximately 30-40 minutes before it disappeared from sight.

Mr. [REDACTED] advised that at no time did the object appear to come in close proximity to his automobile, nor did it appear to make any maneuvers that could be interpreted as hostile in nature. He further advised that during the period of observation, he did not hear any sound emanating from the object.

The information reported by Mr. [REDACTED] appears to be consistent with other sighting reports received in this office concerning unidentified flying objects. Based on the description of the object and its observed maneuvers, it is the opinion of this office that the object sighted by Mr. [REDACTED] was in fact an unidentified flying object, the nature and origin of which could not be determined from the information available.
