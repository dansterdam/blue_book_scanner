Omaha World Herald  
13 August 1958  
Glowing Light in Night Sky  
Definitely Wasn't Satellite

A Lincoln resident and two Omahans reported seeing an unusual bright light in the sky about 3:30 a.m. Tuesday.

No explanation was apparent immediately. "It could not have been a satellite," said Lynn Aspaugh, acting observer in charge of the Moonwatch station at Nebraska Wesleyan University at Lincoln.

The only remaining Russian satellite in the sky passed over the Lincoln area about 11 p. m. The American Explorer is passing over the area during the day, is not visible to ground observers, he said.

The Sputnik III will pass just west of Lincoln at 10:39 p.m. Wednesday and about 10:24 Thursday, he added.

Tuesday's reports came from:

Weslevan watchman, who said he saw the object traveling southwest at 3:28 a.m. He said it was "a bluish white, intensely brilliant oval with a very short yellow-red tail, appearing to be about half the size of the moon."

who was reporting to work at the City Market, 511 South Eleventh Street, at about 3:30 a.m. He called it "a blue flame as big as a basket ball, traveling straight west."

Mrs. who happened to be awake and glanced out a window about 3:25 or 3:30. She said she had the impression of a "flash," then a glowing green object traveling north, then turning west. "It was bigger than a star," she said.

Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

25 SEP 1958

1. Reference message from AFCINT-4E4, 7-1994-B, 0Z/161&i 5ep 53.

2. M/Sgt Jerrol R. Clark, AF 16039391, of Deotchment 2, 100£th AISS, Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, Missouri investigated this incident 4 Sep 53 with the following results:

a. The Source, Mrs. __________ who formerly raeidad near Beebeetown, Iowa, has subsequently moved to B________l B________t, Golor.,do. Mr. ____________, the 
Colorado​  ________, phone________and was not interviewed. Mre. who is now living in Beebeetown, was introviewod but could add little to whaw was already known. ________ residents of Beebeetown who were contacted had no knowledge of the object nor had they heard that one had been sighted.

b. Local residents spoke highly of Mrs. _________. _________ wore of __ the opinion that she was a level-headed person and not of an excitable nature. The police of Missouri Valley, Iowa, about 7 miles Northweat 
of Beebeetown, had no knowledge of the sighting, nor did they know the Source.

c. The attached sketch, enclosure 1, shows roughly the general area of Beebeetown. According to Source's daughter, Mrs. Miller was not awakened by the light as the Mr*. states, but rather that she was unable to sleep and was sitting up in bed when she first noticed light at point "Xlf*. It (the light) proceeded to climb slowly up of the hill "3" at a supposedly low altitude on a general Northeast to Southwest course. The interviewer could not ascertain if sound accompanied the light nor if it actually disappeared behind the trees or disappeared in the distance.

4. Attached as enclosure 2 is a report of weathor conditions at Offutt AFB on 12 August 1958.
