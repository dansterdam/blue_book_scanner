DETAILS

1. This investigation predicated upon the request of Headquarters, 
17th District OSI, dated 5l August 1949, wherein it was requested that a 
newspaper article, Los Angeles Times, dated 30 August 1949, Reading: 
"REPORTERS HEAR DISC TALES AT WHITE SANDS" be investigated and report 
submitted in accordance with AFOCI Letter 85, dated 12 August 1949.

2. This is a joint investigation by Special Agent ROBERT R. JOHNS
and the writer.

AT WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUND, NEW MEXICO

3. On 19 September 1949, Brigadier General PHILIP G. BLACKBURN, 
Commanding General, White Sands Proving Ground, was contacted and advised that 
a preliminary had in no press release to any of the press agents present dur-
ing the firing of the Navy Rocket "Viking", scheduled to be fired on 25 August 
1949. In regards to the article in the Los Angeles Times, General BLACKBURN 
stated he was cognizant of the article but certain that the information 
contained therein was not released by his Army installation. BLACKBURN 
further declared that he had been questioned in regards to several phenomena 
by news representatives but had suggested that they possessed AFOCI Zones 
knowledge regarding this matter. BLACKBURN and his Executive Officer were 
inclined to believe that the news article in question is an elaboration of 
a previously reported Photodocellita sighting on 24 April 1949, by Dr. C.D. 
MOORE, representative of General Mills Aeronautical Laboratory, previously on 
CDX at White Sands Proving Ground.

4. In lieu of Captain ERNEST D. DE RECHTENDY, Post Public Informa- 
tion Officer, timely placed on LST575 prior to overseas shipment, Staff 
Sergeant WILLIAM L. FRIEDMAN, Base Property, Public Information Specialist, 
NEPO, was interviewed and declared that no official press release was made 
by the Army PIO office, White Sands Proving Ground, in regards to any 
phenomenal objects having been sighted at this post, nor had any releases 
been made in regards to the subject article of the Los Angeles Times. 
FRIEDMAN declared that it is an established PIO policy that all news items 
of national interest will first be channeled through Public Information 
Office Headquarters, National Military Establisment[sic], prior to their being 
released, and as this policy is strictly adhered to by all PIO personnel 
U.S.Army, White Sands Proving Ground, he is assur[e]d that subject article 
was not released by his Office. FRIEDMAN declared that he is cognizant of 
the article, as was Captain DE RECHTENDY, and that both had made commetary 
hur[h] determination that the article had been a Naval publicity release. FRIEDMAN 
further disclosed that during the period 24 August 1949 to 30 August 1949, 
the Naval Missi'le[sic] had sponsored the "Viking" Rocket firing, which firing was 
covered by numerous representatives of the press, which included both 
HARNETT T. KANE and CLINE ROBERTS of the Los Angeles Times and radio station 
WNEW respectively. In regards to this press conference, Capt. DE RECHTENDY

Army PIO Officer, had been requested by the Naval Unit to handle all the
details of the conference to include the preparation of the itineraries.
Under these conditions, DETMCINNEY was present during the great portion
of the press conference and FELDMAN is assured that DETMCINNEY is aware
of the Naval person or persons who made subject release to the representatives
of this or the Los Angeles Times. An undated address is herein set forth
to interview Captain DETMCINNEY at his Los Angeles address. Inclosed is a
list of press personnel present at the conference and records of two phone
calls made to the PIO in regards to the article by MILES.

5. Captain WILLIAM A. GORRY and Commander DOUGLAS C. McLAUGHLIN,
U.S. Naval Unit, White Sands Proving Ground, were inxerviewed at their
office 07 19 September 1949, and advised that the Los Angeles Times had not
carried the article contained in the teletype. GORRY declared that WESLEY
MESS, contained no factual data whatsoever. GORRY declared that JAY MARX
MILES and CLINE ROBERTS were present as newspaper correspondents during
the firing of the Navy Rocket Viking and that during this period of two
or three days in which the firing of the rocket was postponed due to
technical malfunction, ROBERTS and MILES had questioned numerous Naval
personnel in regards to the sightings of flying discs and other aerial
Phenomena. GORRY admits that he did have a previous sighting, made
by himself, termed as 24 April 1949, details of same discussed. In regards to
the sightings, as cited in the newspaper article, which was alleged to have
been sighted on the Friday preceding the writing of the article, Captain
GORRY stated that one of the visitors at White Sands Proving Ground had de-
clared that he had observed strange objects in the sky, however, GORRY
placed no confidence in the statement and further doubted the validity
of the statement. On this basis, GORRY declined to divulge the name of
the person concerned. LARLE ELLIS, other than the validity of his article and
through this PIO officer cited further that the individual to whom was
GORRY strongly intimated that it is his belief that the article was written,
to meet the newsman in an effort to justify their presence and existence at White
Sands Proving Ground during the delayed firing of the "Viking" Rocket, de-
claring, "After all, they have to make a living too". The above was corrobo-
rated by Commander McLAUGHLIN. Both GORRY and McLAUGHLIN stated they
possessed no further knowledge concerning the article in question.

6. 1st Lt. ALEXANDER SZAIO, O-1699007, Photographic OFFICER,
White Sands Proving Ground, was interviewed on 19 September 1949 and de-
clared that to the best of his knowledge no photographs of flying discs
had been taken by either of the photographic units at WSPG, nor had any
photograph been taken which showed objects other than a missile or a ruicket. To
the best of SZAIO's knowledge, no photographs had been obtained of a flying
disc and ultimately rulnade, as stated by the article.

7. On 19 September 1949, Captain PAUL T. DAVIDSON, O-54119, Post
Tactical Enno Officer, was intarviewed at his office and has stated that to

Mrs. D. We have no such information, nor have we made any releases, in this office. However, I will switch you to Captain Gorry, and he will be able to answer your questions—since Mr. Roberts visited their headquarters recently.

WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUND
Las Cruces, New Mexico

UNCLASSIFIED

27 April 1949

STATEMENT

On 24 April 1949, three miles north of Arrey, New Mexico, four Navy O- listed men from White Sands Proving Ground (CnCf ████████████████ and ███████) and I saw a rapidly moving object while making a pibal wind run. We released a 350 gram balloon at about 1020 MST and were following it with a standard J1-47 David White Theodolite. After the 1030 reading, ███████ took over the theodolite and ███████ and I looked up to find the balloon with naked eye. We thought we had the balloon when we picked up a whitish spherical object right along the direction the theodolite was pointing (45° elevation and 210° azimuth). The object was drifting east rapidly (50 second as estimated by stopwatch and width of fingers), but we had thought to encounter similar winds on the balloon. When the distance between the theodolite and supposed balloon became apparent, I took over the theodolite and found the true balloon still "there," whereupon I abandoned it and picked up the object after it came out of the sun (this was another good bearing if you wish to work out a sum shot at 1/3 unit at Arrey). The object was moving too fast to crank the theodolite around; therefore, one of the men pointed the theodolite and I looked. The object was an ellipsoid about 2½ football lengths long length about .02° X subtended angle. White in color except for a light yellow of one side as though it were in shadow. I could not get a hard focus on the object due to the speed at which the angles changed. Therefore, I saw no good detail at all.

The azimuth angle continued to decrease as the object continued on a north heading, growing smaller in size. At around 20°-25° azimuth the azimuth halved and the elevation angle began increasing from the 25° minimum to about 35°. The object then apparently disappeared due to distance after t

total time of observation of about 60 seconds.

The object was not a balloon and was some distance away. Assuming
escape velocity, a track is enclosed which figures elevation above the sta-
tion of about 300,000 feet over the observed period. If this is true, the
flight would have probably gone over the White Sands Proving Ground,
Holloman Air Force Base, and Los Alamos.

DETAILS:

1. This investigation predicated upon underdeveloped lead requests contained
in the report of Special Agent JOHN F. FRAMPTON, of the 17th OSI District (IO),
Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, dated 21 September 1949, file number 21-3.

AT ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI

2. Captain EDWARD D. DECHENNEUD, O-45117, Ordnance, U. S. Army, Former
Public Information Officer, White Sands Proving Ground, interviewed 12 October 1949,
White Sands, New Mexico, to Braemar Men, Germany, was likewise enroute from
and stated he had been the Public Information Officer from August 1943 to 12 Septem-
ber 1949.

Captain WILLIAM A. GOREY, U. S. Navy, White Sands Proving Ground, in
preparation to test-firing the "Viking" rocket during the period 22-26 gets forth,
requested the presence of DECHENNEUD from the command of White Sands Proving
Grounds to assist the IO in the accommodation of and proper receiving from the
cover the firing of the Navy rocket. He was to assist naval Public Relations
Officers of the 12th Naval District, San Diego, California, who were in charge of
the party of press representatives. DECHENNEUD assisted in the billing, trans-
portation and orientation of the press representatives on the rocket firing facili-
ties of White Sands Proving Grounds. DECHENNEUD said he was in the members of
the press from the time they descended from their plane at about 1700 hours, 24
August 1949, at Connor Field, until their departure, 25 Augusts 1949.

DECHENNEUD recalled being present at two press conferences at which
all members of the press were assembled. The first conference occurred at the Navy
Officers' Mess and last no interva. GOREY made a short introductory talk and re-
cessional of the Navy Research Laboratory, gave a short talk on the "Viking" rockets.
A film of test-firing took place in the large ATS room of the Officers' Club and movies
of the "Viking" rockets and the German V-2 rockets were shown. (as conferences
reporters were advised by him certain phases of the "Viking" rocket were classified
and any information they were then taught at times was not to be printed and that
the Navy following the firing would hold a conference for all press representatives
at which conference all the phases of the firing would be covered and the press given
data they could use for publication). DECHENNEUD stated he was with one or more
members of the press at all times during the period of their visit and neither at
the conferences or elsewhere heard, either directly or indirectly, any mention or
discussion of Flying discs.

DECHENNEUD asserted that he found certain of the photographers and
reporters were interested in various phases of the Proving Ground itself. He re-
called that when he escorted the reporters to the Ballistic Measurement Section,
certain reporters and photographers were interested in photographing a tracking
telescope and simulating the tracking of a rocket in flight. The tracking tele-
scopes are located five to forty file miles from the Wtlte Sands Proving Ground
Headquarters, The reporters and photographers therefore because of this short
distance were misit by him to the Optical Tracking Section and school were they
learned of the functions and principles involved, regarded as pool photographers had
ample opprrwnity out of the hearings of both himself and Naval Operations Officers
ears talk to technicians and others on their spirit of the Proving Grounds, the

Ballistic Measurement Section and all the tracking telescope sites. Anyone of the
afore-mentioned personnel who knew of the reported incident of last Spring may have
revealed information concerning that incident to the reporters,

In order to refresh his memory, DETWICHEMDY was shown a list of the
reporters who were present for the Naval Firing. DETWICHEMDY knows all the local
Corpus reporters and LMT KOVYRMAN. DETWICHEMDY stated he spent cnmsiderable tlme
with reporter CLUTE ROBERTS, mainly because ROBERTS had returned from Germany in
June 1949 and DETWICHEMDY had just received orders assigning him to Germany and
thereforis DETWICHEMDY was interested in obtaining all the firsT-hand Information
he could from ROBERTS regarding life in Germany. Lt, ROBERTS, he related, was a
free-lance radio commentator who sells anything of news value he can pick up.
ROBERTS would only publish that which he had proof of. ROBERTS carried with hin a
small recorder, both in the field and at press conferences. a portable radio mid elec-
tronic recorder and therefore may have an actual recor8ing of the conversation with
the person from whom he obtained the Information regarding flying discs. DETWICHEMDY
stated It was not unusual conduct for reporters like ROBERTS to carry recording
machines. ROBERTS, according to DETWICHEMDY, always tumed on his desk for sounds
and firings on the White Sands Proving Ground range which are directed by a firing
officer on public address system. DETWICHEMDY related incidents when furn Or bids
related that the assault landing exercise at clurte at about 0300. to unauthorizcd
radio during a fire knowning site he was with twelve (12) photographers and Te-
porters of the press and radio and at this time also he had no period around flying
discs,

DETWICHEMDY did not see ROBERTS converse with, interview any of the
Senior Army Officers of the Sanla Fe Proving Grounds. Brigadier General BLACKIORN was
absent from the Sands and Lt. Colonel ELGIN appeared on the scene only briefly
to welcome the reporters to the Sands, DETWICHEMDY and ROBERTS on the
of two [nval Information Officers one of whom was a Middle Grade officer and the other a
Commander. DETWICHEMDY did not see ROBERTS talk to any individual informally
however, ROBERTS could have done so without his knowing because he too was
was otherwise engaged. DETWICHEMDY was unable to recall names for he had no indi-
vidual contacts with the media and in no remember and distinguish who was from the
others.

LMT KOVYRMAN, according to DETWICHEMDY, was one of the individuals who
went to one of the tracking telescope sites the afternoon proceeding the scheduled
firing. He was accompanied by personnel from the Ballistic Laboratory and went to
the station closest to the Camp. KOVYRMAN would have been with the personnel at the
tracking telescope from about 1500 hours to 1700 hours. DETWICHEMDY did not know
the personnel who manned that partlcular telescope on that date because he remained
with the main group of the press at the Block House.

DETWICHEMDY asserted that as part of his duties as Public Information
Officer he maintained clippings files on information of all kind referring to White
Sands Proving Ground that appeared in various news media. DETWICHEMDY first learned
of the publication of information regarding flying discs at his a Sands upon reading
the article published by the El Paso, Texas newspaper on or about 30 August 1949.
DETWICHEMDY took the article to Brig, General BLACKHORN together with what he con-
sidered appropriate remarks the Impropriety for making such a release without naming
the Individual giving the information; that the release was questionable; that it was
essential the it was treated as classified. General BLACKHORN advised DETWICHEMDY to

see Captain GORYZ since the release had been made to newspapers covering the Navy
rocket firing. DICHECHENDY recalling the content of the articles, stated that it did
not mention any specific branch of the Armed Forces as having been the source of
information but stated it mentioned that two high ranking officers had discussed 
the information. The Sunday after the appearance of the story, DICHECHENDY met
Capt. GORYZ and asked him about the release of the story regarding flying discs
at White Sands Proving Ground. GORJYZ told DICHECHENDY, that this story did thing
of the Navy branching of discs in the Spring and that he (GORJYZ) got a whiff of same
(the story). DICHECHENDY judged from Captain GORYZ's manner and attitude that he did
not consider the release of the story to the news as anything very serious. It is 
DICHECHENDY's opinion that GORYZ does not believe the tracking of 50-called flying
discs as anything unusual.

DICHECHENDY revealed that from 7 April 1949, to 30 May 1949, he was in
attendance at the Radiological Defense School at Biloxi, Mississippi. Upon his
return to the White Sands Proving Ground as a result of the curious as Philip's information,
DICHECHENDY while reviewing the activities of White Sands during his absence, Sgt. 
PELAIA verbally informed DICHECHENDY that he had heard of the actual tracking by 
telemeter group at White Sands Proving Ground of what was believed to be a flying disc.
DICHECHENDY stated he followed this information up and interviewed Mr. CLYDES TOMBAUGH,
Chief, Optical section adjustment Section, White Sands Proving Ground, who informed him 
that the information in question had been prepared by the Technical Information
Division and said no official report had been made of this by the Public Information
Officer of the White Sands Proving Ground and he saw nothing in the news release on 
ceriring it.

On or about 5 July 1949, Mr. SCHULIN, Public Information Officer, 
National Advisory Committee, Washington, D. C., made a one day visit to White
Sands Proving Ground in a general orientation tour. Major LAMMERS, Third Army 
Information Officer on duty as aid for that release, arranged and conducted his tour
and travel on possible land terminal for ranges. SCHOLIN arrived and discovered that 
the Naval Operations Office and there met Commander McLAUGHLIN, who, during the 
visit revealed to SCHOLIN and in his (DICHECHENDY) presence, information regarding 
the tracking of the flying discs in the Spring by Naval White Sands Proving Ground 
personnel. DICHECHENDY said he interpreted McLAUGHLIN and raised the question
Public Information Officer at White Sands considered the information classified.
DICHECHENDY did this to protect the classification of the material and to call the
attention of SCHOLIN that the position of the Army in the matter. McLAUGHLIN replied
to DICHECHENDY that this was all know information by newsmen. It at that he 
did not know what McLAUGHLIN intended to imply by that statement. Nevertheless 
McLAUGHLIN proceeded to go into the details for SCHOLIN of the tracking accomplished 
by his personnel. DICHECHENDY again took occasion to interrupt McLAUGHLIN and
reiterated to him the position of the Army and the manner it treated the subjects.
After leaving McLAUGHLIN's office, DICHECHENDY told SCHOLIN that the White Sands
Proving Ground's Public Information Officer considered all information gathered 
on Flying Discs classified and any release regarding them would stem from official
information channels in Washington.

MALVIN LISTS, aviation Editor, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California,
refused to reveal source for his story appearing in 30 August 1949 issue of
the Times wherein it was stated that an object was sighted in he sky at
White Sands Proving Ground in late February (26 of the 1949). When his
attention, through Carus and as is a Captain's wife (also journalist) who did
overheard part of the verbal report on the sighting of the object. LISTS
said the Captain (believed to be Capt. COMPTON) knew origin of the report
since it was made to him. LISTS would not elaborate other than to state
that the source was also an officer at the USNR, TSPD, and was not an official
visitor nor an enlisted Navy man. much loczing, Lewiscaster, Station KVHD,
Hollywood, California, stated that crews of the information drilled in FIBS,
navassas, was obtained through Kenneth MAYHEW LEWIN, USNR, TSPD,
Commander McLAUGHLIN mentioned, according to RECORDS, the fact that an object
had been sighted in the sky recently and that the photographs thereof "didn't
turn out." RECORDS said that he believed that LISTS' sources for the recent
sighting of an object in the sky was a naval Commander, believed to be named
AUSTIN CONOVER, reporter, Hollywood Citizen-News, Hollywood, Cali-

1. This investigation was conducted in order to determine who had
furnished information at White Sands Proving Ground regarding the sighting
of flying disks to MARVIN MILES, Reporter, Los Angeles Times, and CHET
NOESETS, newscaster, Radio Station KFI/B.

AT LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

2. Prior to interview with, ALLUS, a copy of his article released in
the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday, 30 August 1949, was secured and is being
forwarded to DO /F7 with copies of this report. The article reads as follows:

U. S. OFFICERS SEE FLYING SAUCERS
By MARVIN MILES

WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUND, N.M., Aug. 29—Flying saucers—or at
least mysterious flying "objects"—have been sighted by service personnel
at this vital center of America's upper air research.

I talked with three men, two senior officers and an enlisted techni-
cian, who reported seeing strange objects in the sky, one as recently
as last Friday during preparation for a high-altitude missile flight.

"In all fairness, it must be pointed out that other officers and
engineers at White Sands scoff at the reports and put them down to
imagination, weather balloons, dual images in high-powered optical equip-
ment, or possibly distant planes reflecting sunlight.

Experienced Observers

"Yet the men who gave these reports presumably are familiar with such
possibilities and well acquainted with the appearance of balloons and
planes and their quite results of staring at a fixed point in the sky for
long moments.

"One officer believes, sincerely, that the objects seen are space
ships and declared that a ballistic formula applied to one observation
through a theodolite showed the 'ship' was 35 to 40 miles high—an
ogive-shaped craft of fantastic size and traveling at incredible speeds
of three to four miles a second!

"The observer in this case, he said, was tracking a balloon into the
upper air when the object swept across the balloon's path and carred
for some 10 seconds—making turns up to 22 times the rate of gravity—
before it disappeared. It had no visible means of propulsion.

"The enlisted technician reported seeing an object at 3:35 p.m., last
June 14, as he was tracking the course of a V-2 test rocket in a 20-power

elevation telescope, an instrument that can follow a missile to altitudes of 100 miles or more.

"'I don't know what it was, but I had never seen anything like it before,' he told me. 'It seemed to be metallic, but I couldn't tell its size, its speed or its altitude. It would be impossible unless you knew one of the three factors.'

"He added he had informed his superiors of the incident and was told the next morning he had seen a 'disk.'

"Weather balloon?

"A check of one officer elicited the response: 'It was probably a weather balloon,' but he declared the enlisted technician is considered 'a reliable man.'

"Last Friday's object was seen by a senior officer shortly after 11 a.m. and reported to the unit commander. The observer was preparing for a missile firing and scanning the skies through binoculars.

"'I don't know what it was, but it came out of the north in a shallow dive and turned west. No, I wouldn't guess at speed or size.'

"He hastened to explain he is a 'skeptic.'

"Proof for Skeptic

"'Isn't seeing such a thing the best proof for a skeptic,' he was asked.

"'IT should say it was,' he smiled. 'But I just saw something and reported it.'

"In all, some five reports have been made in the last six months, one officer said, with only one last year.

"On one occasion, he told me, three or four officers saw a flying object with the naked eye, and at another time two smaller objects were observed to 'chase' a test rocket. These may have been dual images on the telescopes, he said, although they were seen from several widely separated stations.

"These reports tend to take the 'flying saucer' question out of the realm of housewife's' stories and the tales of air transport pilots. Still they have actually proved nothing—merely added to the mystery."

3. It is observed that tha title of the artiole as given in the reference report was, "REPORTS THAT DISC LANDS AT ATITRE SAID," and mentioned the fact

that photographs of the object had been ruined. The aforequoted article was secured from the pictorial issue of the Times and therefore may have been changed somewhat from the other issues.

4. MARVIN MILES, Aviation Editor, Los Angeles Times, Times Building, 202 First Street, Los Angeles, was questioned concerning his article and his first remark was, "Do you think I made it up?" MILES was definitely reluctant to talk as to the source of the information for his article but finally gave the following account.

5. MILES stated that he was in the Navy Office at White Sands Proving Ground when someone came in the office to talk with the "Captain." MILES claimed he could not recall the Captain's name and that the Captain was suggested to him he said he guessed that was the name. At any rate, the "someone" was a man who made a report to the Captain concerning the sighting of an object in the sky on Friday (20 August 1949). MILES claimed that he overheard part of this story but claimed he could not recall exactly what he had overheard. However, he further claimed that he did not talk to the man at the time but later sought him out and questioned him further. MILES said this man refused to give his name, but he later learned the man's name and that the man was not a civilian visitor but a member of the personnel who are a part of the things performed by WSPG. MILES, MILES' words give the rank of the officer who heard, but was simply the writer the name of one officer, but added that Captain GROVER could give that information. It is NT suggested, but MILES then wanted to know if MILES was "trying to get someone in trouble" and he was advised that the purpose of the inquiries was to determine his source for his story in order that that person could be interviewed for further details.

6. MILES called attention of the writer to the second paragraph of his article wherein he stated that three men, two senior officers and an enlisted technician, had reported seeing strange objects in the sky, one as recently as last Friday (26 August 1949) during preparation for a high-altitude missile flight. MILES said that this was true. He stated that one of these officers, whose name he would not furnish, had told him about other occurrences which had been noted at WSPG. MILES strongly suggested that the officer in question was Commander DOUGLAS C. McMULLEN, U.S.N., WSPG, but claimed he did not recall the officer's name. The second officer mentioned in his article was apparently also officially stationed at WSPG from the way MILES talked, but he would not elaborate on this.

7. MILES disclaimed any knowledge about an allegation or rumor of any photographs being spoiled when the object reported to have been spotted on 26 August 1949 was seen.

8. CLYDE ROGERS, Newscaster, Radio Station KMTR, Hollywood, appeared very cooperative during the interview with him and stated that he did not know for sure but he thought that the source for this 26 August 1949 sighting of an object in the sky was a Commander LISLE, or something similar, but that MILES, not he, got this story. ROGERS intimated that MILES had told him this,

9.  ROBERTS advised that he did not intend to break any story about
the objects sighted in the sky at WSPG but that on Tuesday morning, 30 August
1949, he noticed MILLS' article in the "Times, ROBERTS further advised that
he called MILLS and said in effect that he thought that there was to be no
publicity on the matter, to which MILLS replied to the effect that the LMRD III
(CRAWFORD of New York Times who also attended the WSPG tests) was going
to break a story and he wanted to beat him to the punch." ROBERTS stated
that he communicated with HILL and HILL denied that he was going to release
any such story.

10.  ROBERTS further stated that since MILLS' story had already broken
he, ROBERTS, saw no harm in broadcasting a little news item on his radio
newscasting program since his sponsor might "wonder where he was" since MILLS
had a story and he also had been to the same tests at WSPG that the navy
similar to MILLS'.  As a result ROBERTS said that in his story over the radio
on 30 August 1949, that objects had been sighted in the sky, and did made a
few remarks about the type of objects, the speed of the objects and the height
of the objects in the sky.  ROBERTS further said that subsequently he saw
Commander McLAUGHLIN and apologized to the Commander for this newscast and
Commander McLAUGHLIN said, "Oh, that's all right.  I don't care."

11.  ROBERTS went on to state that he received quite a bit of information
on the subject from Commander McLAUGHLIN, among which were:

a.  WSPG had an observation point located about 42 miles from WSPG
located on a hilltop where observations had been made of objects in the sky
since 1947.

b.  Objects other than rockets have been sighted in the sky.

c.  On one occasion two disks, or objects, were sighted in the sky
and were flying alongside of a V-2 test rocket, one on each side of the rocket.
One of the objects dropped behind the rocket in the vapor trail and then pulled
up again to the former position at the side of the rocket, and then both objects
shot ahead.

d.  In all probability some men from somewhere or objects from other
planets were checking on the tests—based on the fact that such occurrences
seemed to take place only during the rocket and other types of tests.

e.  Planet MARS will be closer to the earth in a short time than it
was three years ago.

f.  Objects have been sighted at least six times.

12.  ROBERTS stated that in addition to the above remarks he was also amazed
that the U. S. Navy allowed an executive of a minor radio station to bring his
young son and allowed the boy to sit in on the orientation lecture to the news
and radio group.  ROBERTS did not mention the names of these two but it is pre-
sumed from an examination of the list of visitors at the Naval rocket test that

he referred to DOUG DOUGLAS and MICHAEL DOUGLAS, both of whom were allegedly representing Radio Station KKRD, (Los Angeles). The orientation lecture was given by Captain GORVY, according to ROBERTS.

13. ROBERTS was questioned further about any knowledge of a recent sighting of an object as indicated in ILLU's article heretofore quoted and he stated that he "was not in on this" but put "two and two together" and related the following incident. ROBERTS stated that he was recording for a future broadcast and was under and past the restraining ropes, where the rest of the visiting newsmen were, in order that he might get some oxygen "swoosh" as it was being pumped into the rocket. As he stepped back under the restraining ropes he overheard Commander M'CAUGHLY say something to some ne—
identify note know—about objects being sighted in the sky. ROBERTS said that he then made a remark to Commander M'CAUGHLY about him "holding out on him" and this Commander mentioned something about a note with sighting and some photo-
graphs. ROBERTS said that he questioned the Commander about the last remark and the Commander seemed embarrassed, ROBERTS reasoned that the Commander "hedged" on this point and said the photographs "didn't turn out," or words to that effect, indicating that the photographic "nerps" were taken but that through some error the results of the photography were useless.

14. ROBERTS concluded by stating that it "didn't seem that it was necessary as to who was supplying information to at least one of the quoted military newsmen as the writer claimed to talk to all USAF "Code of Communications and News. It is noted that CIVILMAT was also listed as a visitor at the test.

15. The writer checked the library files of the Hollywood Citizen-News at their offices at 1545 North Wilcox Avenue, Hollywood, California, and located a story datelined Tuesday, 30 August 1949, by ALLAN UNION. This article is being forwarded to LW 17 with copies of this report and the article read as follows:

"HOWLING AROUND

"With Austin Conover

"FLYING DISKS REAL, SAY ROCKET EXPERTS

"Mysterious flying objects that are called 'flying saucers' or fly-
ing disks' have been sighted by rocket experts at White Sands Proving
Ground, New Mexico.

"During a visit there last week, I was told by a top Navy officer
who has had long experience in observing high-altitude missilies:

"While sunbathing one day recently I saw a mysterious object cover-
ing high in the air above me.

"Just before that, I turned in a report to Washington that two such objects were observed by a party of rocket experts visiting here. At that

ting I was skeptical. They insisted that I make the report.'

"Homer E. Newell Jr., a top civilian scientist with the Naval Re-
search Laboratory at White Sands, commented: 'I have never seen a
flying saucer. I discount all of the reports about them except a few.
Some just can't be dispelled as pure myth, hallucination, weather 
balloons, or shadows of rockets on clouds.'

"'Flying disks,' said Comdr. Robert McLaughlin, who since 1939 has
been engaged in rocket research, 'have nothing to do with any experiments
carried on by American scientists or for that matter by anyone on earth.

"'If these things are real, they come from another planet, where
creatures are far ahead of us in science.'

"'I heard it said that they are space ships from Mars which have
been attracted to the earth by our atomic bomb explosions and, fascinated
by what they saw, have continued to keep an eye on us.'

"A rocket to the moon is 'a long way off,' according to the White
Sands scientists, who this year sent a rocket to the record height of
250 miles.

"'We need better metals to withstand the powerful thrusts needed to
send a rocket beyond the earth's gravitational pull,' remarked a rocket
expert.

"'We need more powerful propellants,' said another, who suggested
that some newer gas may be the solution.

"The American Rocket Society, which has a test site near Roswell,
New Mexico, was mentioned for its pioneering in rocket research during the
1920s and 1930s.

"The late Dr. Robert Goddard, its founder, and his assistant at one
time, Charles Lindbergh, were singled out for special praise.

"The Germans who developed the V-2 rocket were said to have learned
much from the research of those two men.

"'There will never again be mass bomber flights over enemy instal-
lations,' commented Comdr. McLaughlin.

"'Nazi Germany has developed rockets to the point that they will not
only seek out targets in the air but throw shrapnel over a wide area in
the sky, when they explode.

"'We have found evidence that the Germans were working on such
rockets when this war ended.'

"Such is rocket research today that only a few fast, high flying 
planes in the next war will be able to get through to their target."

"No German scientists are today doing rocket research at White 
Sands Proving Ground.

"We were told that they are working on a secret project at an Air
Force Base near El Paso.

"White Sands Proving Ground base is 50 miles north of El Paso. The
testing is done in a 30-by-200-mile area between the Organ Mountains 
and the Sacramanto Mountains.

"The Navy has requested that we newsmen who visited the base last
week not release the story of what we saw there until Sept. 6."

16. AUSTIN CONOVER, reporter, Hollywood Citizen-News, was questioned
at the newspaper offices and he, like MILLS, tried to be evasive and cagey.
However, he did admit that the information in the first four paragraphs of
his article indicating that "flying disks" or "flying saucers" had been 
sighted by rocket experts at WSPG; that an object had been recently seen;
and that two reports had previously been turned in by the same party, had 
been furnished to him by the Commanding Officer of the Navy Office at WSPG.
CONOVER claimed he did not recall the officer's name and when the name CURRY
was suggested to him it slid that he believed that that was the name of the 
Commanding Officer. It is observed that the source of other quotes in the
article are unnamed therein.

17. An editorial was also located which was written by AUSTIN CONOVER
and appeared in the Hollywood Citizen-News on Monday, 5 September 1949. This
editorial is being forwarded to DO #47 with copies of this report and the 
pertinent part of the editorial is quoted below:

Monday, September 5, 1949 HOLLYWOOD

"HOME GOES THE WORLD BY AUSTIN CONOVER

"INDIGNATION OR MARTIANS

"When scientists and military observers report that they, too, have
seen flying saucers in the sky, it's thought-provoking.

"It's expected the reply, 'Bunk, there are no such things as flying
saucers,' when I asked about them at the government's big rocket-testing
base at White Sands, N.M., a fortnight ago.

"Much to my surprise, men whose business is upper air research made
no such off-hand response. Two said that they have seen flying saucers.
one top military officer stated that a party of visiting scientists

was so convinced that they saw than that he had to make a report to
Washington on the matter.

My fellow newspapermen, working on their own, found a similar 
response among the officials whom they contacted.

"All of the scientists and military observers, whether or not
they had seen any, were agreed on this point: the saucers are not man-
made."

"David Lilienthal, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, dis-
misses as 'foolish' the suggestion that they may be something related
to atomic energy.............."

18. Since the above editorial deals in generalities, no specific ques-
tions were asked CONOVER as to his source for the information set out therein
but he volunteered that he "sort of dreamed it up."

19. It is noted that reference report indicates Commander McLAUGHLIN's
name DOUGLAS C. McLAUGHLIN, and that CONOVER'S article gives his name as 
Commander (Tsic) McLAUGHLIN. Since CONOVER could not remember the USN Com-
mander McLaughlin's name it is possible that none in reality, the correct first
name, If it might also be mentioned here that none interviewing seemed to indi-
cate that the name [redaction] (of the General Mills Aeronautical Laboratory) had
been revealed to them, although it appeared from their releases that the
contents of the report, singed [redaction] had been discussed with them.

20. One copy of this report is being forwarded to District Office NO. 12,
Scott AFB, for their possible information in the event Captain EDWARD D.
RUPPELT of that office posseses information which Captain McLAUGHLIN's
DETACHMENT has as yet not been interviewed.

21. In connection with any further investigation which is conducted by
District Office No. 17 it is requested that extreme care be used in question-
ing any Naval personnel on information furnished in this report by CLIFF
ROBERTS, newscaster, KMTR, Hollywood, since he was very cooperative during
this investigation and attempted to be very helpful.

- Satellite measurements of carbon monoxide and other gases reveal industrial processes, agricultural burning, forest fires and other sources of air pollution. Most of the time, levels of these gases are within natural variability. Sometimes they can lead to an increase in the amount of ozone near the surface of the Earth, which can cause health problems for people with respiratory develops. At other times, these gases can influence climate by changing the amount of heat that escapes from the Earth to space. Understanding these gases can help scientists to predict changes in climate and to develop strategies for mitigating their effects.

- Earthquake preparation is key to reducing losses from these natural disasters. In earthquake-prone areas, strict building codes can help to ensure that homes and other structures will withstand shaking from earthquakes. Early warning systems can give people a few seconds to a few minutes of warning before the shaking starts, allowing them to move to a safer location or to drop, cover and hold on. Scientists also study past earthquakes to understand where future ones may occur and how large they might be.

- VOLCANOES offer a window into the processes that are happening deep inside the Earth. Monitoring these mountains can provide early warning of an eruption, giving people in the nearby areas time to evacuate. The observations also help scientists to understand the chemistry of the Earth's interior and to learn more about the history of our planet. Some volcanic gases can affect the climate, so understanding volcanoes also has implications for climate science.

see Captain GORMY since the release had been made to newspapers covering the Navy rocket firing. DEREBIEANY recalling the context of the article stated that it did not mention any specific branch of the Armed Forces as having been the source of the information but it did mentioned that two high ranking officers had discussed the downed discus. The Secretary after this time at the suggestion of someone at Capt. GORMY and asked him about the release of the story regarding flying discs at White Sands Proving Ground. GORMY professed curiosity with this and during the rest the Navy servicing of discs in the Spring and that they got this story from (not clear). DEFEATEDLY judged from Captain GORMY’s manner and altitude that he did not convey the release of the story to the news as anything very serious. It is DEFEATEDLY’s opinion that GORMY does not believe the tracking of so-called flying discs as anything unusual.

DEFEATEDLY revealed that from 7 April 1949 to 30 May 1949, he was in attendance at the Radiological Defense School at a school, unlisted… Upon his return to White Sands Proving Ground he resumed his duties as Public Information Officer and while reviewing the available range of white range diary and also a Sgt. TELLMAID verbally informed DEFEATEDLY that he had heard of the actual tracking by telescope at White Sands Proving Ground of what was believed to be a flying discus. DEFEATEDLY stated he learned this information up and interviewed the COOP YAMAHA, _ Ballistic Evaluation Section, White Sands Proving Ground, who informed DEFEATEDLY that no official report had appeared in official journals. Furthermore, * that he could find no official report or reports made of such to the Public Information * OFFICER of the White Sands Proving Ground and he saw nothing in the press reports concerning it.

On or about 6 July 1949, line, SCIORA, Public Information Officer, National Military Establishment, visited delor in D.C., made a one day blind trip to the sands Proving Grounds on a special authorization, sawmto the Guided Missiles Information on possible lead for overhead display watcher, conductor who visited the Travail on portions of files and showed to Commander McLAUGHLIN, who, during the this to reveal disclosedly and his two (unintelligible) persons, information regarding the traveling of the flying discs in the Spring by Varval while Sands Proving Ground personnel. Also GHOLGLYN and his interrupted McLAUGHLIN and advised him that the Army Public Information Officer at White Sands considered the information classified. DIDDERENCKLY did this to protect the classification of the material and to call the attention of SCRIMM to the position of Army Arizona in December. Also exhibited a 29 folded to DEMONSTRATION that this was all known to Information that a statement to McLaughlins did not know what to talk Figure intended to question. Beyond the statement stayed that he McLAUGHLIN proceeded to go into the details for SCRIMM of the traveling accomplished by his personnel. DEMONSTRATEDLY again took occasion to interrupt McLAUGHLIN and reiterated to him the position of the Army and the manner it treated the subject. After leaving McLaughlin’s office, DEFERMEDLY told SCRIMM that the White Sands Proving Ground’s Public Information Officer considered all information gathered on flying discs classified and any release regarding them would from official information channels in Washington.

MEMO

25 Aug 49

1. The attached information regarding unidentified aerial objects has been 
reviewed.

2. This Laboratory does not feel justified in saying definitely what the nature 
of this unidentified object may be.

3. It is believed that significance should be attached to the fact that the 
observer could not get a hard focus on the object and therefore obviously did not 
make an exact determination of idea distance. One of the points emphasized by 
Dr. Paul M. Pitts in his recent review of similar findings was that observers usually 
were unable to determine the distance of the object. Unless distance is determined, 
all estimates of the size of the object and of its linear speed are unreliable. It is 
believed possible that, had the observers been able to bring the object into clear focus 
in his theodolite, he might have been able to identify it.

Unless distance is determined, all estimates of the shape, size, then speeds and altitudes necessarily remain quite speculative.

DETAILS:

1. This investigation was initiated by the District Commander, 9th OSI District, upon receipt of information that an unidentified aeie- phenomena was sighted over Vicksburg, Mississippi on Friday, 22 April. 19--, which was described as a "flying triangle".

AT JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI:

2. The following newspaper item taken from the Jackson, Mississippi Daily News, dated 23 April 1949, is quoted verbatim:

'FLYING TRIANGLE' REPORTED OVER VICKSBURG FRIDAY

A "flying triangle" was reported seen in the sky over Vicksburg last night. JAMES E. PARKER said he saw the object "like a lighted triangle" shortly after midnight. He said he could not estimate the height or speed of the object, and there was no noise to indicate it might have been a high fly- ing airplane.

AT VICKSBURG, MISSISSIPPI:

3. On 11 May 19--, the writer in* rviewed Mr. --------- at Vicksburg, Mississippi, who stated in substance that he sighted a fly- ing trangle at approximately 022 hours, central standard time, at April 19--, in the vicinity of Vicksburg. When this object was sighted, it was within the city limits and approximately one and one-half (1-1/2) miles from the center of the city of Vicksburg. -------- further stated that he was standing in front of --------. When he first sighted this object, -------- stated that he could not locate the latitude on the map, ------ only saw one object and when this object was sighted, it was at about a forty-five (45) degree angle, going east, and was at a seemingly high alti- tude. -------- further stated that he observed this object from a period of from five (5) to ten (10) seconds.

-------- described the color of the object as being milky looking, like a flourescent light, but not quite as bright. -------- described the object as being in the shape of a triangle, each side of the triangle being approximately four (4) feet in length and one and one-half (1-1/2) feet in width. Running down the outside edge of each side of the triangle was a row of lights.

-------- further stated that this object was headed due east in level flight and that there was no evidence of exhaust, nor was there any effect caused on the clouds by this object. All light appeared luminous; but slightly milky. This object appeared to be supported by wings, but there was no evidence of any kind of propulsion, nor did he sight any type of stabilizers or antennas on this object.

"On April 22, 1949, as well as I can remember, about 12:15, I
got out of a cab at Clay and First Streets, and I looked up and saw a
Flying Object shaped like a triangle and it was dimmed lighted, traveling
at a fast rate of speed, traveling faster than the average plane.
It looked like to be 1 ft long and it was high in the air. It was
traveling east. See drawing at bottom of this page, I couldn't esti-
mate the height or speed.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 11 May 1949, the writer interviewed Mr. [REDACTED] at Vicksburg, Miss., who stated in substance that he sighted a flying triangle at approx. 0220 hours, central standard time, 25 April 1949, over the city of Vicksburg. When this object was sighted, it was within the city limits and approximately one and one-half (1-1/2) miles from the center of the city of Vicksburg. Baylor further stated that he was standing in front of [REDACTED] when he first noticed this object. Baylor stated that he could not locate the latitude on the map. Baylor only saw one object, and when this object was sighted, it was at about a forty-five (45) degree angle, going east, and was at a seemingly high altitude. Weather observer stated that he observed this object from a period of five (5) to ten (10) seconds.

Source described the color of the object as being milky looking, like a fluorescent light, but not quite as bright. Source described the object as being in the shape of a triangle with the two triangle angles being approx. four (4) ft in length and the single angle (1-1/2) or two (2) ft in width. Running down the outside edge of each side of the triangle was a row of lights. 

Source further stated that this object was headed due east in level flight and that there was no evidence of exhaust, nor was there any effect caused on the clouds by this object. All light appeared luminous, but slightly milky. This object appeared to be supported by fins, but there was no evidence of any kind of propulsion, nor did he sight any type of stabilizers or antenna on the object. Source stated that this object was travelling at a speed faster than commercial planes, no tail or trail planes, no buzz- when a jet type aircraft. This object did not make any sound. Source of disappearance of this object was that it "just disappeared" in a clear sky as though it traveled out of sight.
