The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, likely from 1956. The text on the page discusses the analysis of a UFO report, providing details about the object's appearance, light and shadow characteristics, and recommendations for further investigative steps. The report does not mention or identify any individuals.

Ltr. ATIC, Subj: Analysis of UFO Report, IR-61-56

Clearer wire lines between base two points are all clear and in sharp focus, in contrast to the object which is somewhat fuzzy and unclear.

1. Photo analysis strongly suggests that the out-of-focus, indistinct background of the object caused by any intervening motion through space, but because of its very close proximity to the camera, the images of the object will show an object will appear lighter in color as it recedes into the distance. The object here, which is supposed to be approximately 1000 feet or over one-third of a mile away, is as dark or darker than any object in the field of view.

2. The direction of the light and shadows on the object does not appear to be consistent with that of the surrounding objects, as a study of all the photographs attached indicates.

3. In addition, the identification of the object into sharp different densities reveals unusual fine detail and on the object which suggests a thin, sharper outline of the object's configuration. This is unusual, as the general trend is for the density of the film image to become more murky or less sharp as the distance increases.

4. The opinion submitted in the IR that the sighting may have been caused by a "temperature inversion" cannot be remotely considered, as the object shown here is a dark, solid, tangible one and such inversions usually cause distortions and ragged shapes of hot and cold air masses combined with a wavy or cloudy formation which they are a part of.

5. In accordance with established policies for providing field assistance with guidelines and casistence on UFO investigations, the following is considered in the investigation of sightings or study type involving UFO photographs.

a. Investigative and interviewing personnel "mentally" prepare themselves, and the demeanor and guidance shown within the U. S. photograph.

Lt. ATIC, Subj.: Analysis of UFO Report, IR-01-56

This will assist in determining the sun's position at that time and whether the sun was out among other factors, as the statement of the source to the contrary notwithstanding, as our case files often disclose.

a. The direction and angle of elevation which the camera was facing. Not given in this.

b. The type, make, lens size of the camera, shutter speed, and exposure settings used. In all cases where the source states he does not know what f-stop or speed used, the minimum and maximum scale of those cameras gradients should be obtained, and drives in the AP 112.

c. Type of film used.

f. There an object is not shown in mid air, as in this case, determine whether any object or means just outside the picture area could have been used to support the supposed "flying saucer" which may have been misidentified in this instance.

g. Consider the observer's age (13, in this case); his opinion or interest regarding "flying saucers"; whether any motion pictures of flying saucers were recently shown in his location, and whether he has done any extensive reading on flying saucers or his interest sparked chiefly by some information published in the newspaper of a recent date. Investigators must consider the plausible and possible inaccuracies of such very brief and unconfirmed statements.

h. Refer to AIF 200-2, "Intelligence Photography," for guidance on collection involving photography, with specific reference to pertaining to paragraphs 17 and 18. This manual is also used by investigative units of the army, navy and FBI.

The reference is made to Air Intelligence Information Report (Form No. 112.1-0) dated 25 August 1956, with subject: "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING, SAN BERNARDINO, CALIFORNIA". A photographic negative of the unidentified flying object was attached to this report. This negative was returned to the source at the address given in the report. At the time of the sighting the conditions were such that the negative was not considered as evidence to justify up the negative and did not carry with it the address assumption as the report was returned as soon as practical.

2. On 14 October 1956, an article appeared in the "Aviation Week" column of the Los Angeles Examiner referring to this incident. This article indicated that the Air Force had stated this negative was not returned to the source. This statement is not correct. The negative was returned to the source as indicated in the report and is attached to this letter.

3. It is possible that considerable publicity adverse to the best interests of the Air Force could result from this statement if subject negative is not returned to the "source" as soon as practicable.

Case 174, San Bernardino, CA., July 10, 1956 - In San Bernardino, California, W. L. George, an aircraft engine mechanic, saw an unidentified flying object. According to the report, George was driving to work when he saw a bright object in the sky. He stopped his car, grabbed his camera, and took a photograph of the object. The AP carried a wirephoto of the photo, which was printed in the Los Angeles Mirror and The Times, but the story is centered around George's story as relayed to the Daily Sun. Michael's story tells of the object flying in a northerly direction at a terrific speed, moving so rapidly it was hardly visible. George attempted to photograph the object, but due to its rapid speed, was only able to capture a brief image before it disappeared.

Sur in Hawthorne 
Over Airport Deal
By TOM TOWERS
Aviation Editor
Reports that the city-owned Hawthorne Airport might be leased to the Northrop Aircraft Company for use as a parking lot for the firm's trucks and storage of equipment came as something of a jolt to local residents and leading space on the front pages.
Consensus went that the transfer would be a mistake because we are a good general aviation airport and should remain that way. That normally would be spent on the plane enables us to prepare for traffic much more in the future.
AIR FORCE REPORT—AIR FORCE REPORT—AIR FORCE REPORT
Hawthorne airport. According to figures compiled by Air Force flyers, there were 60 aircraft on the field on May 1, 1945, and 90 aircraft on July 1, 1946. This would seem to indicate that the field is becoming more and more utilized as time goes on. A field that at one time appeared to be a rather small and insignificant one, apparently is developing into a fairly busy spot. The development of this has not been particularly rapid, but steady and sure. This field, located adjacent to the Hawthorne municipal boundaries, is owned by the City of Los Angeles. The City Attorney's office has declared that the city has no intention of leasing the field to any commercial enterprise. According to official sources, the events reported in the press did not occur and the field will continue to be operated for general aviation purposes. The city maintains that the field is self supporting from revenues derived from rentals and other such sources, and that there is no intention of disposing of the field in any manner at the present time.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Date: 12 July 1956
Case No: 6787274

Subject: Unidentified Flying Object 

Location: San Bernardino, California

Time of Sighting: 2045 hours, 6 July 1956

Description of Object:
The object was observed to be a bright, circular, metallic object approximately 15-20 feet in diameter, hovering above the horizon. The object was observed for approximately 2 minutes before disappearing behind a nearby mountain range.

Conclusions:
The object could not be identified as any known aircraft or other conventional flying object. No definitive conclusions can be drawn as to the nature of the object observed.

We are returning a negative and four prints of an unidentified aerial object which was observed over San Bernardino, California on July 7, 1956. Your photograph and a report of the circumstances surrounding the observation were referred to this Center for analysis by Air Force personnel who investigated the matter.

The image size of the object on the negative is 2 3/16 by 1 11/16 inches, the total length of the lens is assumed to be approximately 3 inches. The image is slightly blurred, possibly due to camera motion. The image size of the object on the prints is 5 1/16 inch, over-all size.

The image in the report is estimated at 300 yards at a distance of approximately 1400 feet. The object of such size appearing over this particular area and location would equate approximately to the size of a football field, or over 400 feet in diameter.

Analysis of the photograph shows that the foliage in the background, and the two distant hills, between which the object is located, are in good focus, indicating the object is at a considerable distance. The object, however, appears somewhat fuzzy and indistinct.

The analysis indicates that the cut-off-edge distortions noticeable by apparent unsharp spots, but these are very close to the normal exposure, and is essentially imperceptible clues to suggest the object is a very close proximity to the camera.

It was about 3 a.m. Both were awakened at the same instant by the intense yellow glow and lift-off from the ground. To him it appeared round and self-luminous. Reassuring himself that he was not being deceived by hallucination, he watched the object for a short time, the following night, but saw nothing."

Washington, Indiana

Case 172. Washington, Indiana, July 10, 1956 - Frank Edwards of WTTV, Indianapolis sent CRIFO the following information which appeared in the Washington Daily Times:

"A Washington, Indiana man reported he saw a bright, shiny, disc-like object hover above the trees near his home about 10:35 PM. He said the object was about 20 feet in diameter, emitting a bright red light. It hovered for a few seconds and then shot straight up and disappeared. No sound was heard."

We quote this as a good case because: 1) It was seen by a man when awake and looking out of the window; 2) It showed the characteristic hovering and then rapid ascent typical of many UFO reports; 3) The sighting lasted for a few seconds only, eliminating the possibility of misidentification.

The witness was sober, the night clear, no clouds and the object was under close observation through binoculars. Its size, shape, color and speed of departure clearly indicate a technological device and not a natural phenomenon. There were two or three smaller lights beside the main object and these were reported to move erratically. The direction of departure was to the northeast and the angle of ascent was higher and faster than any known aircraft.

Text Transcription:
U.F.O. SEEN EARLY THIS MORNING OVER WASHINGTON
(Editor's Note: This is an incident that happened locally. We have verified the account as honestly given by observers with the understanding that their identity be withheld because of the obvious reasons. We present it to our readers as a true happening but they individually will have to decide what they, personally, would make of the situation.)

Today I will have to admit that I have been converted to the strange phenomena which they call "flying objects". On two other occasions I have seen the same type of object, but this time I saw it from its beginning until it disappeared. It was moving across the sky at tower altitude and appeared to be somewhat oval in shape. It was a brilliant white light, varying in intensity, and it took 4 or 5 minutes to pass completely out of sight. It was carefully observed at a distance of about 40 miles when I first noticed it. At that distance it appeared to be about the size of a half dollar at arm's length. It moved across the sky in a straight line at a very uniform speed and finally disappeared over the eastern horizon. All of the other lights on the object except the hub remained bluish. The hub remianed steadily bright like a flashlight from my position, steadily moving again toward the east. It made no sound whatsoever. I snapped and awoke my wife to observing it with me. She finally gave up and went back to bed, while I continued to observe this object until it disappeared from sight.

Case 164. Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky, July 19, 1956----Two Cincinnati witnesses observed a circular object "it up like a lantern" pacing an air transport plane heading over Kenton County Airport, Kentucky. They said the object was bigger than the plane. It performed a series of turns and flights shown by the aircraft, and when the plane landed the object continued its course. Both sighters had been skeptical of saucers, but were changing their minds.

Several substantial citizens of Gary saw it and described it as being as big as a full moon and having a bright white light in the center. The document states that the director, Dan Shannonoff, was notified, and he told the witness to lock the sighting. The text also mentions that the Air Defense Command was also informed about the sighting.

GARY POST TRIBUNE SUNDAY JULY 15TH 1956

Saucer or Jewel? Sky Visitor A Mystery
Bright Light Seen
On Gary Horizon
Stays for Hour,
Moves to South

Gary had a mysterious visitor in the sky early yesterday. It was not a plane, satellite or anything man-made, but a bright light that remained hoverin on the horizon for over an hour before moving to the southwest and disappearing.

The light was first noticed about 11:15 p.m. Saturday by three persons who were returning from the Gary Theater in the 2600 block of Broadway. They said the light appeared to be low in the southwestern sky, pulsating and changing colors from white to red and green.

The persons who saw the light were Walter Dombrowski, 2520 Washington St., and two companions. Dombrowski said the light seemed to be "as big as a house" and occasionally flashed brilliantly.

"It was like a full moon, only much brighter. The light would dim down until it was almost impossible to see, then it would flash up again, brighter than ever," Dombrowski said.

He said the light was stationary for over an hour, then began drifting slowly to the south southwest until it disappeared from sight.

The light was also seen by several other persons in the Gary area, including patrolman Albert DeMarco, who was on duty at the time. DeMarco said he watched the light for more than 45 minutes.

The Air Force said this morning that there had been no reports of any aircraft, balloons, satellites or other known objects in the area that could explain the light. The sighting is being investigated, but the Air Force has no explanation for the mysterious light at this time.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

As any optical experiment will show, an object will appear smaller in color as it recedes into the distance. The object here measures 4000 feet or over one mile and appears darker and darker than any object in the field of view.

The object does not appear to be consistent with that of the surrounding objects. A magnification of the image into three different densities reveals an object just inside the left density and the right density protrudes.

15 JUL 1956
CASE 728

I. SOURCE: Address: [redacted], San Bernardino, California
Age: 41 years old
Occupation: Student - Christian Ministerial Studies 
Qualifications: None
II. RELIABILITY: Good. In a personal interview, the witness was cooperative and related and rational in his thinking of the events.
III. DETAILS OF INCIDENT: The witness stated that on 17 July 1956, at about 10:00 PM, he was lying on the grass in the backyard of his home watching airplanes with 2 cameras when he noticed what appeared to be 2 "orange balloons" hovering in the sky approximately 100 yards away at an altitude estimated to be about 300 feet. There was no noise and the objects hovered motionless for about 2 to 3 minutes. He then observed 2 small "balls of fire" appear from the center of the objects, one from each object, and travel straight down at a 45 degree angle, disappearing from sight. Immediately after the "balls of fire" disappeared, the original orange objects shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared. The witness claimed to have taken several photographs of the objects, but stated that when he developed the film, there were no images on the negatives.
The witness seemed to be sincere and did not seem to have any other motive than to report what he saw. He claimed to have no other unusual sightings before or since this incident. All factors considered, this report is felt to be a legitimate observation. No other reports have been received from this area regarding similar sightings. The witness confirmed that the weather conditions at the time of sighting were clear with a slight breeze. There was no moon visible. Source's description of weather conditions at the time of sighting corresponds to reports from other sources regarding conditions in the area on that date.

SUBJECT: Analysis of UFO Report, IR-01-56
TO: Commander
4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron (.AIS)
Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan

1. Reference 4602d AISS UFOB Report Nr. 469, originally submitted under AF Form 112. IR-01-56, from Headquarters, 27th Air Division, 5 August 1956.

2. Attached hereto is a negative and photograph of an unidentified flying object photographed over San Bernardino, California on 19 July 1956. Also appended are three enlargements print enlargements of varying densities used in the analysis of the object photographed.

3. Comments on this Camera Center: On the basis of a review of the information submitted and a photo analysis of the photo material submitted, the following comments are offered:

a. With a negative size of 2 9/16 by 1 11/16 inches, the focal length of the lens are assumed to be approximately 3 inches (75 mm).

b. The image size of the object on the negative is 5/16 inch, over-all size.

c. The distance of the object as given by the source in the report is estimated to be approximately 3,000 yards. This size would appear to be in the order of two-thirds the size of a football field, or over 200 feet in diameter.

d. An object of such size appearing over a populated city or area of California could certainly have been noticed and reported by a large number of persons. No reports on this type of incident are indicated for this particular day or area.

e. A study of the photograph shows that the foliage in the foreground, the leaves on the trees in the background, and the two telephone poles are in focus, while the object is not. This would indicate the collage is in the background, and the object is a long distance in the foreground.
