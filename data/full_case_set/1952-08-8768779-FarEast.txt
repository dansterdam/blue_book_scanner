At 0104i on 29 Aug 52 over XE 2841, aircraft 6359, which was scheduled for weather reconnaissance in the Simiiju area, sighted an unidentified object. The aircraft was on a heading of 014 degrees at an altitude of 23,000 feet, weather vis 2/8 to 3/8 undercast with no moon. The 0112-19Z was made by the Pilot-Commander, Aircraft Commander, Pilot, Navigator, B.N.G. and Sight Scanner. The object was described as appearing to be 6 or 7 feet long, cigar shaped, orange-red in color and traveling at an estimated speed of 600-800 MPH. It was traveling at an angle of 45 degrees from the path of flight of the object. No trail was seen but the whole object seemed to glow with an orange-red color. The object was first seen at the 2 o'clock position and disappeared after passing off at the 11 o'clock position at an angle of 45 degrees approximately, remaining in sight for approximately 1 minute. It disappeared when it was 150 feet above the airplanes altitude. The sighting lasted for a maximum of 1 minute. The experience level of this crew is 3,400 hours combat missions and all concur on the above sighting. No other information is available.
