MEMORANDUM REPORT to Commanding Officer, Air Transport Squadron ONE
Subj: Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/9 February 1951

At 0055Z on 10 February 1951, while serving as second plane Commander on above flight, I was an eye-witness to an unidentified sighting of an unidentified object. This occurrence took place at approximately 43-50 N and 50-03 W, which is approximately 300 miles east of Argentina, Newfoundland. We were at 10,500 feet at the time cruising on a true course of about 355 degrees.

At time of sighting I was occupying the right hand (co-pilots) seat; and the last hand (pilots) seat was occupied by Lieutenant G. E. BETHUNE.

My attention was first called to the occurrence by Mr. BETHUNE, who asked me to look at an unusual light which was to my right. I then saw that there was a glowing light similar to the early layer of cirrus-form clouds beneath us. This light was to my right and down at an angle of about 45°. This object appeared to be stationary and did not change its relative position to our aircraft. It seemed to be of tremendous size, and at first thought that it could be a large ship completely illuminated.

Mr. BETHUNE and I watched the object for several minutes in trying to determine its nature. We then called our Navigator, Lieutenant M. J. B. RODGER to the cockpit to scrutinize the object and render his opinion as to what it was.

While further observing the object I saw that it suddenly started ascending through cloud layers quite rapidly. The object was very large and was circular with a glowing yellow-orange ring around its outer edge. The object appeared to be rather luminous and moving at a tremendous speed, and it appeared to be one or more collision courses with our aircraft. Due to high probability of collision, I pulled the aircraft into a climbing turn to avoid the object. During the course of his events, T/Sgt A. L. JONES has come to point out on sight in a short period of time.

Due to the fact that this object was seen over water at night it would be impossible for me to estimate speed, size, or altitude. However the size would indicate that it was from 200 to 300 feet in diameter. The object was close enough to me to be no farther than one and a half to two miles away. Its speed was tremendous, as it traversed the sky in an extremely short period of time.

MEMORANDUM REPORT to Commanding Officer, Air Transport Squadron ONE 

Subj: Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/09, February 1951

1. At 0055Z, 10 February 1951, I was the Plane Commander of Flight 125/09 from Bermuda to Argentina. We were climbing to 10,000 feet on an instrument flight plan. Our position at 10/0552 was 41-40 North, 50-03 West, or about 500 miles southeast of Newfoundland and at 10,000 feet on a standard instrument flight plan. Our speed was 110 knots. The weather was clear with about 60 miles visibility and the wind was variable at about 40 knots.

2. I was in the cabin of the plane checking the passengers when one of the navigators, Lieutenant N. 7. COONE, came up and reported to this phenomena. I watched it for a minute and went forward to the cockpit to get a better view. Upon reaching the cockpit, I took the plane off of the automatic pilot and turned to a true heading of 290° in pursuit of the object. The object kept on a heading of about 290° and was at about the horizon in a very short time.

3. It would appear to the speed to be well over 1500 miles per hour, and the diameter to be at least 300 feet.

4. My first view of it resembled a huge fiery orange disc on its edge. It then appeared to go into a vertical position as it flew off overhead. It was throwing off a fiery trail as it went over the horizon. I aimed the plane to go after it but it was gone in a very short time.

5. At 10/0345, I called Gander Tower on VHF and asked them if Gander had any information on an unidentified object in the vicinity. They stated they had none but would investigate. When we landed at Argentina at 15/2202, we were interrogated by Capt. D. N. PARTLETT. Apparently LCDR WASHINGTON, British TCA, Argentina, was flying on the right side at the time of the incident.

Subj: Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/9 February 1951.

1. I was piloting on flight 125/9 from Keeflavik, Iceland to NAS, Argentina.

2. At approximately 0550Z/10 February 1951, I was reporting our position to RADEA Navigation when I sighted an unusual object. At that time we were on a true heading of 230° at a true air speed of 190 knots, and a ground speed of 160 knots due to a 70 knot headwind.

3. Lieutenant KINGDON pointed out an orange colored object about 6000 yards, or 3.4 miles, away, saying it appeared like a small village or a ship. Due to our position, I was certain it wasn't a village.

4. I had been looking at the object about thirty seconds, which it appeared to me was another demonstration of the "northern lights" phenomena which occur at that latitude, when the object suddenly changed direction at a high rate of speed. I pointed this out to Lieutenant KINGDON, but owing to the crowded cockpit, I did not get another look.

5. The best view I had of the object showed it to be a circular, bright orange-red disc, which was approaching us at a very great, undeterminable speed.

I, GRAHAM E. BETHUNE, was Co-Pilot on Flight 125 from Keflavik, Iceland to the Air Station, Patuxent on 9 February 1951. At 0052Z I sighted and observed the following object:

While flying in the left seat at 10,000 feet on a true course of 230 degrees at a position of 50 degrees 50 minutes N, 50 degrees 03 minutes W, I observed a glow of light below the horizon about 1,000 to 1,500 feet above the water. This glowing mass appeared suddenly, then was a thing suddenly, there was a twin bright light in the center of the glow. I called it to the attention of Lieutenant KINDON in the flight. He also saw the object for 40 to 50 seconds. I called it to the attention of Lieutenant JOHNSON in the flight. He was unable to see this send at roughly 20 to 40 miles away. I asked "What is it?" a ship. Lighted up or a city, I know of nothing that would light up over 250 miles out. We both observed its course and motion for about 4 or 5 minutes before calling it to the attention of the pilots.

The object was a glowing white mass, elongated in shape, and rapidly increased in size and altitude as though its speed was in excess of 1,500 miles per hour. Its attitude and size increased as though its speed was in excess of 1,500 miles per hour.

It seemed to close in on the aircraft and then dart away. In midair, at this time its angle changed and the color changed. It reversed its course and tripled its speed until it was at least seen disappearing over the horizon. Sudden changes in altitude and occasional disappearance over water indicated distances cover would be at least 300 feet in diameter, over 1,000 miles per hour.

Subj: Report of Unusual Sighting on Flight 125/9 February 1951

On 9 February 1951, while on flight 125 near the Azores islands, a strange sight was witnessed by Lieutenant XXXXXX XXXXXXX, USNR, the aircraft commander. At the time I had left the cockpit approximately 1 hour prior to this sighting. The time of the sighting was 0252 and the position of the aircraft was 49-50N 50-03W Latitude. I was called to the cockpit by Lieutenant XXXXXX to witness this scene.

When I first saw the sight it was far away from us and rapidly disappearing over the horizon. Not being too familiar with flying in this particular area, my first impression was the celestial setting of the moon and the fact that the bright layers were present to cause the bright red glow and the halo effect that was apparent.

I did not witness the entire proceedings as did some of the other pilots, but I was told that little I did see of it did seem to have an impression on several of the crew. The object disappeared at a high rate of speed, approximately 2000 mph.

After being asleep for awhile I heard someone saying something to the effect of the sighting of the aircraft. I looked up by head to the window and saw a round object which to my looked like it would be from 20 to 30 ft. in diameter. It didn't seem to only roll but also move from side to side.

We were off the coast of Newfoundland about 2 hours on Flight 125 from Iceland on the 9th February 1951, when I went forward to find out if the pilots or crew would like any coffee, soup, or etc. When I entered the cockpit, the co-pilot, commander, and co-pilot called my attention to a light at about 2 o'clock and slightly lower than us. It looked like an ellipse of the moon and white in color. The light was about three-quarters of the total eclipse of the moon and seemed to be stationary. The distance this light seemed to be was at least 520 knots if not more. The distance the light seemed to be was very close to that time Mr. JONES came forward and I went aft with the passengers.
