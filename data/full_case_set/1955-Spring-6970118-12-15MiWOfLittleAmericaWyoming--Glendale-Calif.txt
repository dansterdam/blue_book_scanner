The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a project blue book document, specifically a Project 10073 record card. The card provides details about a sighting of unidentified objects that occurred in the spring of 1955 in the W of Little America, Wyoming/Glendale, Calif. area. The objects are described as "grapefruit, like spinning discs with little effect".
