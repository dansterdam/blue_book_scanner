REPORT STRANGE OBJECT OVER TANGIER AND FES -- Fes, Le Courrier du Maroc, 22 Sep 52. REFER TO( SE: 112102-FR) (3) - 6347 -
On 22 September 1952, at around 21:15 hours, a luminous disk of a diameter close to that of the setting sun, 17 kilometers from Tangier, saw toward the south. A luminous trail followed it for about 12 seconds; the disk, which looked like a brightly illuminated metallic object, suddenly emitted two great streaks of flames and disappeared.
At 1820 hours, a strange object was also seen in the sky over Fes, French Morocco, flying at high speed from east to west and leaving behind a luminous white trail.

BELIEVE OBJECT OVER MOROCCO ONLY A METEOR. RABAT'S L'ECHO DU MAROC 23 SEP 52.
5:55 P.M. 22 SEP 52 - A BRILLIANT UASE(?) OBSERVED OVER MOROCCO EAST OF RABAT. ALL MOROCCO AND BEYOND WAS OBSERVED OVER RABAT. IT SEEMS MOST LIKELY, HOWEVER, THAT THIS WAS ONLY A METEOR, BECAUSE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE OBJECT WAS GIVEN AS RECTILINEAR, IT DID NOT MANEUVER IN THE WAY OBJECTS SUPPOSED TO DO, AND ITS TERMINAL VELOCITY WAS THAT OF FALLING MACHINES.
THE OBJECT WAS VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED AS AN ORANGE-COLORED BALL OF FIRE, AN ARROW, OR A CONE-SHAPED OBJECT TRAILING A BRIGHT GREEN-BLUE CLOUD OF SMOKE, HEADING FROM EAST TO WEST AND PARALLEL TO THE COAST, AND MOVING AT THE SPEED OF A CONVENTIONAL PLANE AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 1,000 METERS. THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE FOR ONLY A FEW SECONDS. AFTER IT PASSED AWAY, A THIN, WHITE TRAIL OR SMOKE REMAINED VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES.

PILOT GETS CLOSE VIEW OF SAUCER FOR BRIEF INTERVAL -- Casablanca, Maroc-Presse, 23 Sep 52

The pilot of a transport plane flying over Casablanca, Morocco, on 23 September 1952, had a close encounter with a flying saucer for 10 seconds and about 50 meters in the same direction as the saucer while making an approach at the same level. As he was preparing to land at an airfield in Casablanca, at 1825 hours, he noticed the strange object about 30 meters to the left of his plane as he circled the airfield. He saw a luminous object fly between his plane and the ground. It flew the same line of flight as the plane, maintaining the same speed. The latter was doing 220 kilometers per hour. It looked like a bright light, and the object was going about twice as fast. He mentioned it to his passengers, who saw it too.

He heard no noise coming from the object. As the pilot passed the plane, it disappeared. It is possible this was the same object that was sighted at the US Airbase at Nouasseur by ground personnel, who reported it, fearing it, as this was a regular occurrence.

That same evening, in Azemour, French Morocco, a French couple and their farm workers heard a loud explosion as the strange flying object passed over their farm. This is the first report: a very fast way of moving in this same case the flight was said to have occurred at 1820 hours.

THOUSANDS WITNESS SAUCER OVER MOROCCO AND TANGIER -- Casablanca, Maroc-Presse, 22 Sep 52.

PETER a CASE MOLEEZ-TIRAR FR. 4-52.

On 22 September 1952 about 1:15 hours, a luminous disc-shaped saucer, flew at a great speed over Casablanca. Shortly afterwards, about 15 observers at Rabat saw the same object which was now stationary, and our Tangier correspondent received reports from local residents.

The observers called to say that he had seen the object going from east to west at 1:15 hours (about 2-3 minutes before it flew over Casablanca!). ALSO, two observers painted on the object with a chronometer: it was then 1:17 hours, and the object was coming from the direction of Rabat, travelling from East to West.  

Some of the reports gave the following details about the object: luminous, cigar-shaped, about 40 feet long, a silvery-green globe ending in a long cone and flying about 700 feet up, the same as a plane which flew by the object (according to Casablanca); and a flashing, glowing, object-stopped, was trailing white smoke in puffs, as though puff followed an explosion.

About 6,000 spectators at a boxing match in Casablanca saw the object pass over the area at 1:15 hours. Louis Gentil, numerous persons saw it at 1:15 hours (according to the reports). It made its appearance in Rabat, then in Casablanca, if made its appearance to the east, a meteor, again traveling from east to west.

LETTERS GIVING OBSERVATIORS OF UNUSUAL AERIAL OBJECTS

Dear Sir,
As per your inquiry, we inform you that the incidents referred to have definitely been observed and were quite real to those who saw them. Our original report of this incident is dated 23 September 1952 and is contained in our files under date of 29 September 1952.
Dear Sir,
In reply to your inquiry, we inform you that the incidents referred to have definitely been observed and were quite real to those who saw them. Our original report of this incident is dated 23 September 1952 and is contained in our files under date of 29 September 1952.
Only last summer, I received an official telephone call in the middle of the night, from an officer in the French Air Force who was stationed at Rabat, French Morocco. He frantically reported that a strange aerial object had been sighted by a number of pilots and ground personnel stationed at the Rabat airfield. He stated that the object was circular in shape, glowing with a reddish-orange light, and hovering at an altitude estimated at around 5,000 feet. He said it hovered in the same general area for around 10 to 15 minutes before suddenly zooming upward at a terrific speed and disappearing from sight. I identified the mysterious thing as the planet Jupiter. However, the officer insisted that this was no planet, but some sort of strange craft or vehicle carrying out a highly unusual and unexplainable aerial maneuver. Needless to say, I was quite surprised by the vehemence with which he argued this point, and amazed at the action allegedly performed by the object.
There have been so many incidents of this kind, reported from various parts of the world, that the cumulative evidence is becoming quite impressive. Scientists are beginning to take the phenomenon much more seriously, though the problem is still baffling and there is no generally accepted explanation. The relative motion of such observed objects is clearly observed, however, and one cannot dismiss the possibility of some kind of intelligently controlled vehicle operating in our atmosphere. Full scientific investigation may reveal a natural explanation, but at the present time, the problem remains unsolved.
Very sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
