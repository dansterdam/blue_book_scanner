10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
One round bright red object, the size
of a penny held at arm's length, obser-
ved at an angle of elevation of 15 dgrs.
in the northwest. Seen thru binoculars
of unknown power. The object had been
seen for 1 1/2 hours at the time of the
report & was still in sight.
11. COMMENTS
The planet Venus was at the
same position as the UFO i.e.,
15 dgrs elevation in the NW.
This sighting was undoubtedly
caused by the planet Venus. The
duration of the sighting & the
fact that this object has been
reported before substantiate the
above theory.
