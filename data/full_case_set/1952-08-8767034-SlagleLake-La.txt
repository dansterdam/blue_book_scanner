AERIAL OBJECTS: 
At approximately 2:40 hours, 23 August 1952, Master Sergeant Frank Polk, Williams Air Force Base, Williams, Arizona, reported the sighting of several unidentified aerial objects. Polk was driving a 1941 Ford sedan on the highway approximately 12 miles west of Slagle Lake, La. He observed 5 lights moving across the sky in a southwesterly direction. The objects appeared to be disc-shaped, and emitted a glow. They were moving at a very high speed, Polk estimated their speed at 1000 mph. The objects were observed for approximately 3 to 4 seconds and blinked out instantaneously. 
CONCLUSIONS: 
All aircraft at a distance were moving away from the observer's location. No aircraft were found in the area which could explain the sightings. It is possible for the normal night sky to appear to contain moving lights which may be mistaken for unidentified aerial objects. Unless the aircraft involved can be positively identified, it is impossible to conclude whether the sightings represented conventional or unconventional aerial phenomena. The phenomena were of such short duration that no further investigation could be conducted.

Based on the image provided, there does not appear to be a photograph present. The image shows text that seems to be part of a document or report from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the image reads:

RECOMMENDATIONS:
that the airports in vicinity be checked for light aircraft flying
on the nights of 13-14-15 of August 1952. A check
of the Terre Haute Airport records reveals that no aircraft were flying in that
of 15 August 1952.

Q. Will you please identify yourself?
A. Lt Col ----------------------, Armor - ----------

Time of Sighting Object: 
Approximately 2200 hours, Tuesday, 19 August 1952.

Climatic Conditions:
Warm, no fog, visibility dark, cloudless, no moon, warm evening.

Location: 
Slagle Lake, (Co-ordinates 80-83) Slagle - Burdon Grande, 1/25,000 scale.

Were you accompanied by anyone else?
A. This party can substantiate statement of Col. ------------.

What was the object you saw?
A. I do not know. It appeared to be a single light, two separate objects, which seemed to be illuminated lights.

What did you see? 
Object as seen by us was in diameter about the size of a base-ball, the object was observed first. While looking due south one object came in view and from observer's view at an angle of 45 degrees above horizontal. Attention was attracted by white light moving west to east. The observed was not at an excessive speed and apparently remained stationary. In approximately two (2) minutes after becoming stationary, the object disappeared.

REPORT OF OBJECT OBSERVED FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE FIRST OBJECT

The object observed from the direction of the first object as described, was in the nature of a small, bright, round object which appeared to be approximately twice the size of a star. It seemed about three (3) minutes of arc in diameter, was of a pale, greenish white color and with some interior coloring or markings. It was viewed as a point source.

(Note: First object observed will be identified as "object 1" and second object will be identified as "object 2" for remaining data.)

Both objects observed in place approximately one (1) minute, object 1 was observed to make a course change in an easterly direction as it moved slowly in a westerly direction. After object 1 had moved approximately three (3) minutes of arc, object 2 became stationary in approximately the same position originally occupied by object 1.

Upon completion of the movement of object 1, object 2 remained stationary for approximately thirty (30) seconds after object 1 had moved. Object 2 then changed color rapidly to a deep reddish red and pulsating red light, followed by pulsating green light which appeared to be entire object 2 for a period of time. Object 2 occupied in this area. During object 2 movement to south, south west, object 2 was observed to show its movement clearly with apparent decrease in size and return to its original position previously occupied. Object 2 is now moved as it was stationary approximately three (3) minutes.

According to the OCR output:

Second subject arrival at the point of object 21. Object 21 was observed to whirling so pulsating, red and green lights as objects did in the same position, after which object 21 remained stationary and hovered while for approximately five (5) minutes. After great pulsating, the object was observed to again return to its original position. During this time object 21 was observed to remain in a stationary position. Both subjects continued to remain in position as stated for approximately two (2) minutes. Following this object 21 was observed to have in a north-westerly direction at an angle estimated at 45 degrees. Object 21 now appeared to be one of same during (2/2) size or approximately and appeared to be at approximately the same distance and held the same constant white light. This movement was estimated to be less than one (1) minute.

It was also observed that approximately two (2) minutes after object 21 ceased the green color, then object 11 was observed to commence a north and traveled to a position generally south from the observer and about the size of a baseball and appeared to occupy the same position as originally observed as a stationary object. Immediately following this, object 11, within thirty (30) seconds after resuming stationary position changed color to rapid red pulsating color, then chang ed from red pulsating color and back to original white color.

Object 11 appeared to remain a stationary as a white object. Following the changing to the white light object 11, observed to {REDACTED}

FORMAL STATEMENT FOR (1) MINUTE, THEN BEGUN TO BE A SOUTHERN DIRECTION. DURING THAT TIME IT IS OBSERVED TO BE THE SIZE OF A DIME AND THEN COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED. DURING THIS PERIOD OBJECT WAS CONTINUED TO HOLD ITS POSITION IN THE SAME FOLLOWING THIS, OBJECT WAS APPEARED TO RETRACE HIS ORIGINAL ROUTE TO THE SOUTH EAST TAKING UP A STATIONARY POSITION DUE SOUTH OF THE OBSERVER'S POSITION. AFTER REMAINING IN THIS POSITION STATIONARY FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE (5) MINUTES, THE OBJECT WAS THEN OBSERVED TO CHANGE COLOR TO A PULSATING RED LIGHT FOLLOWED BY A PULSATING GREEN LIGHT. THESE PULSATIONS LASTED APPROXIMATELY FIVE (5) SECONDS, THEN RESUMED HIS ORIGINAL WHITE COLOR AND REMAINED IN THIS POSITION FOR AN ESTIMATED TWO (2) MINUTES. THE OBJECT THEN DISAPPEARED TO MOVE RAPIDLY AS AN OBJECT AT DIMINISHING IN SIZE. OVER A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY TWO (2) MINUTES IT BECAME UNDISTRINGUISHABLE BY THE OBSERVER.
CONCLUSION: THE OBSERVER IS OF THE OPINION SINCE THE OBJECTS PRECISE MOVEMENT AND VISIBILITY AT THE REPORTED HOUR IT COULD HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BY OTHER OFFICIAL SOURCES.
RECOMMENDATIONS: THAT THIS REPORT BE DISSEMINATED TO THE APPROPRIATE AIR FORCE AND ARMY INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WHO MAY HAVE INTEREST OR RELATION OF THIS REPORT WITH THAT OF OTHERS REPORTED DURING THE SAME PERIOD BY OTHER OBSERVERS.

UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
ON 29 AUGUST 1952, I WAS INFORMED THAT CAPTAIN WILLIAM R. ADAMS . . . WAS INTERVIEWED AND APPARENTLY, CAPTAIN ADAMS WAS INTERVIEWED AND APPARENTLY, CAPTAIN ADAMS STATED THAT ON 20 JULY 1952, HE OBSERVED TWO ILLUMINATED OBJECTS THAT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FIVE (5) INCH DIME AT ARM'S LENGTH OVER SLAGLE LAKE (30-003) (CIRCLE SANDERS CREEK, 3/2:200) ON THE EVENING OF 19 AUGUST 1952 WHEN THEY SIGHTED TWO UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS. INITIAL SIGHTINGS WERE AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 HOURS . . . IT IS INDICATED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 15 MINUTES AND WERE INITIALLY SEEN TO BE ABOUT TWO LIGHTS WHICH APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 140 DEGREES AZIMUTH AND 60 DEGREES VERTICAL FROM THE OBSERVER'S POSITION. THEY WERE THEN OBSERVED TO MAKE TWO OR THREE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL MANEUVERS THAT WOULD INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR BEING GUIDED. AFTER APPROXIMATELY 10 (10) MINUTES, THE OBJECTS BEGAN TO SLOWLY MOVE AWAY AND WERE LAST SEEN AT APPROXIMATELY 2 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. THE ORIGINAL WRITE-UP INDICATED THAT THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FIVE (5) INCH DIME AT ARM'S LENGTH AND THAT THEY APPEARED AS IF THEY WERE ILLUMINATED. IT IS INDICATED THAT ATTACHED SKETCHES SHOW THAT THE OBJECTS APPEARED AS ROUNDED OR DISC-SHAPED. ON INDICATED THAT IT WAS HIS OPINION THAT THE OBJECTS WERE METALLIC AND PROBABLY BETWEEN TEN (10) TO FIFTEEN (15) FEET IN DIAMETER. THE ORIGINAL WRITE-UP INDICATES THAT THE OBJECTS WERE IN THE POSITIONS INDICATED ON ATTACHED SKETCHES, AND EACH OBJECT SEEMED TO EMIT RED AND GREEN COLORED LIGHTS. THE ORIGINAL WRITE-UP INDICATES THAT THE OBJECTS MOVED AWAY AND CHANGED DIRECTION AS IF THEY WERE A PART OF THE SITE WHOLE. THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR AND DARK, THERE WAS NO MOON. COMPARISON WAS MADE OVER A LONG WATCH THAT HAD BEEN BORROWED, WHICH MEASURED 2 HOURS. THERE WERE STILL SOME DOUBTS, HOWEVER, ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE OBSERVER.

some times over which the objects were observed. there were no
distinguishing landmarks with which to determine relative distance
of the objects observed. Mr. [REDACTED] could not estimate the speed
of the objects, but was "very much impressed" by their rapidity of
movement. lights were noticed to vary in size. they appeared
larger than the average normal lights seen in the sky. the lights
identified as "c-r2" attached appeared momentarily after its appearance and seemed to the
witness to travel in an irregular manner. the "c-r2" then disappeared and finally disappeared together with r-r. there was no
feeling or apparent movement away from mr. [REDACTED] at the time the
lights disappeared. the manner of disappearance was the same sensation one experiences when an electric light is switched off.
just before the lights disappeared, mr. [REDACTED] strained to hear any
noise resembling the "put put" of an outboard motor, but col [REDACTED]
could not hear the noise himself.
