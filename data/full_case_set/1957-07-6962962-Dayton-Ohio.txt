Text from the document:

Jupiter and Saturn Rule Skies

Lyre Leads the Way
Shortly after dark during the month of July, the eye catches the brilliant yellow-white star nearly halfway up the eastern sky. This is Vega, the brightest star in the Lyre constellation. Following Vega in a line toward the south is the faint but conspicuous Altair, the 12th brightest star in the sky. These two stars and the fainter Deneb, nearly overhead, mark the Summer Triangle, a prominent landmark among the summer stars.

Star of Distinction 
Higher in the south, the golden planet Jupiter shines with a steady brilliance, far outshining any star. At the present time Jupiter is the most prominent object in the evening sky, the brightest it will be this year. Saturn, the ringed planet, is well on its way toward the southwest, shining with a soft yellow light just a little less brilliant than Jupiter.

United States of America.

Dear Colonel Spaulding,

Further to my letter of June 13th, 1956, I am pleased to inform you that the matter of the photograph you mentioned down the telephone had been raised with the Editor of the magazine.

However, I am sorry to say that the photograph was not examined as this edition of the magazine had already gone to press at the time when it was first launched on the world - Enquiries instituted by the Editor revealed that the photograph in question had been received too late for inclusion.

So while I am disappointed that this did not get included, I am happy to say that we have arranged to reprint the relevant extract from your letter. 

The extract I have made is mainly to say that I used two plastic covers for model aeroplane, and that I am sending two more. I returned the two you sent me as I had no further use for them.

Mr. Spaulding goes on to say that:

"His full name is either F.J. or R.D. Pool (I cannot read his signature). And his present address is G. Broadfield, 
Hatfield, Herts."

I propose to...

The image contains a photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO) that appears to be a disc-shaped object hovering above the ground. The photograph seems to be part of a document or report from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

Output from the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system:

Out of this world: a picture of some kind of unidentified flying object taken north of Dayton, Ohio, on July 6, 1957. This is a project blue book case - case 6962962. 

As you will see from the attached photographs, this object seemed to be hovering over a field. The photographs were taken by an Air Force photographer who happened to be in the area. I have studied these photographs and have a number of comments.

First of all, I have handled many photographs of unidentified flying objects in the past and have an eye for separating the real from the fanciful. In my opinion, these photographs appear to be genuine. There is no indication of double exposure, retouching, or other tricks. The object is clearly visible in the sky, and the details of the ground and surroundings appear normal.

Secondly, the object itself has a definite form and structure. It is not a mere blur or vague shape, but a distinct disc-like form with what appear to be markings or indentations on the surface. This lends credibility to the report.

I would be most interested in having an opportunity to study these photographs further and to interview the photographer. Naturally, we would protect his identity if he so wished. 

I trust you will find this report useful. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Yours sincerely,

Charles Bowen,
Editor

P.S. I have made a few minor editorial changes to the letter for clarity, but the content is unchanged.

CSI OFFICER SEES UFO

July 21, 1957: On this day a UFO was observed by CSI's Organizational Vice President. The witness, a CSI officer, was sitting in his car on the deck of a boathouse about half a mile above Diamond Point, on the west shore of Lake George in northern New York. He had been taking some friends from the boathouse to their homes. The witness, who now saw it, replied: "My God, could that be it?" as he saw a luminous whirlpool-like object in the sky. The object had a brilliant golden color and three tails or streamers emanating from its rear. It moved slowly in the east-northeast, just above the treetops, and was very emphatic about the luminosity; the glow reflecting off the surface of the water below had been noticed by a passing motorist (a plane, reflecting a brilliant golden glow, had passed in the eastern sky a few minutes before).

A whirling, pulsing luminous object, apparently about the size of a basketball, was moving slowly southward (toward the observed) and did not seem to have any definite shape, since he could not see it himself, since he rushed indoors (which, when found, was not located anyway). He did, however, enough to feel sure that the object was a definite shape that had the appearance of a figure or some kind of apparatus. Its outline was not fuzzy, and its contours were well-defined. Moving deliberately southward, it appeared in all directions and then disappeared, which would seem to indicate that it was a possible target for a passing aircraft. It had been in view for four minutes by the observers; it could not have been a balloon, an airplane, or a star. It was lost in the "afterglow". It had been in view for four minutes by the observers; it could not have been a balloon, an airplane, or a star. It was lost in the "afterglow". It would seem to have been seen in the movie "U.F.O."

No Case (Information Only) 2 July 1957
Lake George, New York

July 2, 1957: About 1:30 p.m. on the same day that CSI vice-president, X, sighted a UFO at Lake George, New York (see Maj. X), another interesting sighting was reported. A brilliantly shining UFO of peculiar shape - like a kettle-drum - was observed. It appeared to hover over the area for some time and was seen by several persons.

When first noticed and the boys first noticed it, the "flying kettle-drum" rose in the air and disappeared rapidly, leaving a trail or wake. It shot across Interstate Bridge (They live about three miles west of the Hudson River) and passed over to the eastern side of the river. The object is described as being about 25-30 feet in diameter, beautifully metallic in appearance, and rotating or turning on its axis as it moved smoothly and silently. It left no trails.

But as it proceeded northward, its shiny finish abruptly turned to a dull, dark grayish color, and it disappeared from view. The object was first noticed at an altitude of about 500-600 feet and was not due to the sunlight reflecting off of it. The sky was moderately overcast and the object was visible against the cloud cover. The observer aid it gave no appearance of being a plane, helicopter, balloon, or any other conventional aircraft. It passed from view in a northerly direction, without changing course or losing altitude. It was in view for less than ten seconds and no more than twenty.

The incident drew appeared in the Bergen Evening Record, July 3rd. Mrs. XXXXXXXX and requested the contents of this report from major XXXXXXX. She was very interested in receiving any information on this case.

Campos, Rio de State, Brazil

UFO Follows Brazilian Airliner
On July 4, 1957, a Brazilian airliner plane was followed by a UFO, according to the report. The UFO was sighted by the crew and passengers of the airliner, which was traveling from Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro. The UFO reportedly followed the airliner for approximately 15-20 minutes at a distance of about 300 meters.

The report states that the UFO was a luminous object that was watched by the crew and passengers of the airliner. It also mentions that the airliner's captain reported the incident to the Brazilian government upon landing. The report indicates that this incident was investigated by the Brazilian government.

SEEN FROM THE AIR

Captain Paulo Ramos Ribeiro of Cruzeiro do Sul Airlines has sent us an account of the sighting over the South Atlantic on 13 July 1957. The object observed over the ocean was luminous and was noticed by the crew at 17:50-6 o'clock GMT) we were flying the Convair-600, 12,000 meters high, magnetic heading 239, near Rio Doc., about 100 km from the coast, when we suddenly observed a luminous object crossing our attention to a strange light.

"The light was white and its illumination was
and it appeared to be
had seen before. It flew very rapidly in almost a straight line, at an estimated 50 kilometers from us.
It made a 90 degree turn, very rapidly, and continued
towards the coast. At the moment it changed its course, we were able to clearly see that it was some sort of disc, shaped something like that which is 
shown on the map below. Although it were made of aluminum.

"There was no noise or trail and the white luminance seemed to be emanating from it. It could be compared to the water being stirred by a moving motor-boat - just a sort of luminous, hazy trail behind the body of it. What we saw was a luminous, hazy disc showing blue and green colors changing in quick succession. The speed was tremendous and no sound was audible at the time."
