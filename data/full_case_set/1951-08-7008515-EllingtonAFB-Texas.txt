AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
DATE: 27 June 1951
PLACE: Ellington AFB, Texas
SUMMARY: A crew of 4 AF pilots of the 384th Bomb Sq, 100th Bomb Wing, Laredo AFB, Texas, on a routine navigation training flight, observed an unidentified flying object on the night of 27 June 1951 at approximately 2200 hours. The object, brightly illuminated, was observed for approximately 30 minutes.
The object was first observed at approximately 10-12,000 feet altitude, and seemed to be traveling about 450 mph. The object appeared to be cylindrical in shape and was estimated to be approximately 30-40 feet in length. It had a bright light emanating from the forward portion, and a greenish glow around the midsection. The object made a rapid climbing turn and disappeared from view. No exhaust or trail was visible.
CONCLUSION: The object observed cannot be identified. No balloon, aircraft, or other conventional air vehicle known to be operating in the area could be responsible for the observation.
