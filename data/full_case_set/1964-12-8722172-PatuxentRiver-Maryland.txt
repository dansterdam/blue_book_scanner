AIR OPERATIONS OFFICER'S COMMENTS: The circumstances creating this report were prompted by a phone call to this office at 1330 hrs, 19 December 1965 indicating an unusual radar observation near the Patuxent River, Maryland area. Investigation revealed that the radar return was caused by a flock of birds drifting in on a southerly direction between 1300 and 1330 hrs on 19 December 1965. Weather conditions were clear with good visibility. The incident was discussed with other members of the division. Until the matter was investigated further, no further action was required or taken.

No other radar at any location is known to have acquired simultaneous
data.
The observers said no report initially because they felt the
nothing of significance to report.
The individual(s) who informed the local radio announcer
unknown.
Information relating to this incident was released to the
public only after the information was properly investigated and
stories and long before it was completed.
The date identified in this investigation considered factual and
by the observers indicate radar presentations or physical impressions in the sky were not of normal or standard known aircraft or bird. The statements indicate the radar presentations were described as
indications proceeding directly in toward the scope center of at
second per second). They appeared on the scope at about 30 miles range and remained visible for about 8 seconds.
Another single indication showed at 40 miles. This particular indication was estimated to be at an altitude of 10 to 20 thousand
another single indication showed at 50 miles. These successive
indications showed it to be 10 and 20 miles, respectively, and
toward the second (reported) by an observer.
This incident report in all probability does not relate to the potential
merely astronomical a day and time of the observation
visual phenomenon. However, this does not account completely the claims of the observers.

M/R 5 JAN 65, SIGHTINGS (RADAR), at Patuxent Radar, NAVY Missile Test Sup. (STILL CLASSIFIED) Occurred on 29 December 64 and 4 January 65, Supposedly these sightings.

First information regarding these sightings was from Major Jacks, SAPOI, at approximately 0930, 5 Jan 65. 

He associated these sightings on the Patuxent Radar at Patuxent, Md. on 29 December 64 and 4 January 65. Some of the radar trackings indicated speeds of 1,300 mph. Also radar track on night of 4 Jan 65 at 0825 L indicated speed of 1,100 mph. A report had not been made to ATIC. Also said that a time mentioned in the 5 Dec 65/3 Jan 65 message, found out it was a 1200 it should have been. He is said to be perplexed as they were in a conference regarding this matter. He is apparently more concerned over the lack of report to ATIC than the actual sightings.

Captain Bretthauer, ADC Liaison officer checked out info regarding this incident at the same location and concurred. Negative all the way. Also ADC did not have any report.

PID's press desk was notified to see if anything had come over the wire.

Call from SAPOI at approximately 1500 hours, 5 Jan. They indicated report for 4 Jan targets was false.

Mr Stoneking from the Journal Herald called. Major Quintanilla indicated that no report was ever received.

At approximately 1630 hours Major Quintanilla said he had received a call from Major Jacks. He told Maj Jacks that there was no additional information.

M/R 6 Jan 65
Called Major Miller, meteorological liaison officer, and requested a full report of this incident. Received from him P.O. Box 9190, Dec 64, to AFSSC REPORT: 
Contacted Captain Bretthauser and requested an official TWX from the area which was given in the phone on 5 Jan 65.
Letter Category: AFSC (SCT) called. People there were bugging this sighting. Told him we did not have an official report as yet. Significance of this sighting could be determined from various tracks in area.
At approximately 1113 we contacted Lt Vol at Patuxent. The investigation at that time was being conducted by APRO (Aerial Phenomena Research Organization) and they were not sent out. The reports that were released are quite inadequate and should contain more data. Several tracks were observed on the ground which started near the beach and the house and moved out to sea. This was evidently started by a rumor with someone (younger) talking about lights in the area and their interest was heightened by an article written by(Major) Mr. Donald E. Keyhoe in "TRUE Magazine" in Dec 1964 which people had seen and telephoned.
Lt Vols at this time told Information Office at AFSSC that this matter is still under investigation and I am awaiting further report (analysis) had been made. And that information provided was confidential, incomplete and incorrect.
(As an interrogatory 1130 we notified SAFOI (SAFH) of the above and gave her the above information.

11 Jan 65 - Received Msg from Patuxent at 1100 hrs. Lt Vols called - he was at Patuxent asking if we had received the report on a sighting made 11 Dec 64. He preliminary analysis was completed and he awaited guidance.
At 1145 we gave preliminary analysis of what was suspected.
12 Jan 65 - Received Navy speedletter at 1000 hrs. Lt Vols called stating he had seen the UFO over Patuxent and would like to submit a report. We called him back at 1110 Navy Commander called regarding the sudden sighting. Also Navy Lt Comm requested the Navy report to Mr Vincent for radar analysis.
At 1130 Navy report was submitted to Mr Vincent. He called and reviewed the analysis. She called him back and gave him the analysis. She requested that Navy obtain better photographs or films on any future sightings.
Coordination between 1515 and 1545 news release was discussed and coordinated with SAFOI.
13 Jan 65 at 1130 Final press release from SAFOI was received.
14 Jan 65 at 0900 hours we submitted a copy of the Navy report and Blue Book's report on the analysis of the Patuxent NAS sighting to SAFOI.

CASE D C-20320  

1. Based on the results of a Navy investigation and analysis of radar targets over the Patuxent Naval Air Station on 12 Dec 1964, it has been determined that the targets reported by the resident Naval Air Station and adjacent radar centers on the east coast revealed no unusual or unidentified radar targets created by some other electronic device within the station.

2. A check with an independent radar complex at Patuxent and adjacent radar sector centers on the east coast revealed no unusual radar targets.

Patuxent RAS, Maryland
29 December 1964

Based on results of an investigation by the Patuxent RAS and analysis of information supplied to the Air Force by the Navy, it has been determined that false radar targets were mistakenly reported as unidentified flying objects on 29 Dec 64. Study of the shape and illumination of the return indieates that they were created by some other device within the station or were caused by an intermittent abnormal condition within the circuitry of the radar set itself. This conclusion has further verified by a check with an independent radar complex at the NAS and with adjacent radar sector centers on the East coast which showed no corresponding radar return on that date.

Operators at Patuxent Naval Air Station, Maryland, reported an observation of an unidentified object which came onto their scope at 4,000 yards, came to a full stop, executed a tight turn, and disappeared from the scope. The object was first observed to be traveling east-west along the west coast and has a "very high speed".

NO UFO'S OVER VIRGINIA - MARYLAND?

The Air Force is investigating the reported sighting of two unidentified flying objects over Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Maryland.

The radar operators observed two objects on their scope rapidly closing in on the station at a speed of 2,700 m.p.h. for 10 to 20 minutes. (From the report, 15 Dec 1964)

The visual sighting was made approximately 2 minutes after the radar contact at 5:35 p.m. est. on 8 December 1964. The objects were described as glowing and metallic in appearance.

The Navy passed on the report to the A.F. at Wright-Patterson A.F.B. (From a teletype message, 14 Dec 1964)

The objects were described as "similar to the configuration of a C-141 aircraft". The AF said: A study of the shapes and the descriptions indicated that the objects "were probably F-106 jet interceptors from the local area". (From a letter, 17 Dec 1964)

It was stated that "Palms radar returns may have been insect or cloud interference, as we don't get any similar blips," it said.

National Capital Region, 17:27-:28 Richmond, Virginia:
"Nobody saw a similar blip," the AF said. For the time period and the location there, the report was questioned. US was? Why did they release this report without checking this?

EXPLANATION
On 8 December 1964, at 1840 EST, a luminous object was observed by the crew of an aircraft in the vicinity of Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Maryland. The object was first observed at an azimuth of 020 degrees and elevation of 30 degrees, moving in a northerly direction. It then changed direction to the northeast and accelerated rapidly, disappearing from view in approximately 30 seconds.
The object was described as being 3 to 5 times the size of a star, pulsating and rapidly varying in intensity. No definite shape could be determined. The weather at the time was clear with visibility extending to the horizon.
Analysis of the reported sighting indicates that the object was probably a satellite or meteor. No conclusive evidence exists to substantiate the reported observation as an extraterrestrial vehicle.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page discusses the results of a Navy investigation and analysis of information supplied to Project Blue Book about an unidentified flying object reported by the Patuxent River Air Station on December 29, 1964. The document indicates that a check with an independent radar complex at Patuxent River revealed no unidentified radar sector centers on the east coast.

Based on the results of a Navy investigation and analysis of the information supplied to Project Blue Book by the Patuxent River Air Station, it has been determined that the target reported by the Patuxent River Air Station as an unidentified flying object on 29 Dec 1964 was a valid target. The shape and illumination of the target indicates that it was created by some other electronic device within the vicinity of the radar set itself or was caused by some disturbance within the circuitry of the radar set. A check with an independent radar complex at Patuxent River and with the east coast radar sector centers revealed no unidentified radar returns.
