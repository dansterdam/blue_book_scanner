"PROWL CARS SPOT DISKS IN SKY HERE"

Whatever they are, there are some disk-like objects flying around in the sky.
Or else eight Portland area policemen and deputy sheriffs who sighted the objects Friday, numerous private citizens, the crew of a United Air Lines plane over Boise, Idaho, and a coastguardsman who claims to have photographed one near Seattle, are all wrong.
In Portland the alert was sounded over police radio at 1:06 p.m. Friday, after the East Side station received a score of calls that the disks were overhead. Within seconds, two prowl cars reported spotting the mystery craft.

FLASKS SEEN, NOISE LACKING.

First to report in were Patrolmen Walter Lissy and Robert Ellis in Car No. 82, who stopped near Oaks Park. Both World War II veterans and civilian pilots, they sighted three of the objects within 50 seconds traveling at great height and speed over the park. They reported they heard no engine noises but saw flashes. The objects seemed erratic and changed direction of flight. The patrolmen agreed that without knowledge of the size of the objects it would be impossible to judge their speed or altitude.
Patrolman Leo L. Patterson from car No. 13 stopped at SE 82d. avenue and Foster road to look eastward from there the disks were reported. Telephones calls located them coming out of the sun. He saw nothing, but a few seconds later observed one coming out of the west and heading southwest. The craft seemed to be aluminum or eggshell white end didn't flash or reflect light, he said.

OBJECTS UNIDENTIFIED.

A former air-corps veteran, he said the object was unlike any plane he'd ever seen. He thought it appeared radio-controlled because the disk could change direction an a 90-degree angle without difficulty.
Members of the harbor patrol at the foot of N Irving street stopped out when they heard this all-car alert. Capt. K. A. Prenn, harbor Pilot, A. C. Austad and Patrolman K. C. Loff all saw the objects and said they appeared to be going south high over the Globe mills at terrific speed. Capt. Prenn said the flashes kept them from ascertaining whether there were three or six.
The disks would oscillate and sometimes we would see a full disk, then a half-moon shape, then nothing at all, he reported. The objects looked more like a shiny chromium hub cap off a car which wobbled, disappeared and reappeared.
There was a plane in the sky at the time, but all were emphatic that the disks were not planes.

AIRLINES CREW CONFIRMS REPORTS OF FLYING DISKS: FIVE SPOTTED.

Circumstantial reports of flying disks in the sky Friday came from
the crew of a United Airlines plane over Idaho, and a coast guards-
man near Seattle, as well as from Portland area police and citizens.
The crew of a United Airlines plane over Idaho, and a coast guards-
man near Seattle, as well as from Portland area police and citizens.
The captain of the airliner, told United Press that he 
sighted five "somethings" which were "thin and smooth on the bottom and
rough appearing on top." The objects appeared against the sunset shortly
after the plane took off at 3:04 p.m., he said.
"We saw them clearly," he reported. "We followed them in a north-
westerly direction for about 45 miles. Finally the objects disappeared.
We were unable to tell whether they outsped us or disintegrated.

NOT AIRCRAFT.

"We can't say whether they were saucer-like, oval or anything else,"
the captain said, "but whatever they were, they were not another aircraft,
nor were they smoke or clouds."
In Seattle, Coast Guardsman Frank Ryman, 27, reported to United Press
that he snapped a picture from the front porch of his home which showed a
"white saucer" flying over the north end of Lake Washington.
Among pictures, two North City, seaside residents sent in prints of photo-
graphs showing lights over Lake City end of Lake Washington.
Bob Jasper, 19, Oaks Amusement park employee, reported that he saw
several objects "like spinning disks" in the sky Friday. He said several
picnickers, including a woman pilot noticed them.
In Vancouver, Wash., Sheriff's Deputies John Sullivan, Clarence
O'Kay and Fred Irives heard the Portland police radio broadcast and ran
out of the sheriff's office to look at the sky. Over Portland, three to five
miles away, Sullivan said, they saw 20 to 30 objects "like a flight of geese!"
They heard a low humming sound.

OTHERS DOUBTFUL.

Col. G. F. Dodson, commander of the Oregon national guard, made an
inspection of this area from the air after the disks were reported here.
He said he saw nothing "suspicious."
Only known military airplanes in the air at the time of the reports
were 23 B-29 bombers near Astoria.
Despite all the reports, at least two persons remained unconvinced
of the existence of the disks.  Holgate moorage, gave his
opinion that the objects were  blossoms.
______, 34, of ________telephoned the Journal 
to berate the newsmen for "perpetuating a hoax." He said he saw objects in
the sky about a minute after an airplane passed over his house. To him the
objects looked like bits of aluminum foil, perhaps cigarette wrappers.

MORE SEEN LATER.

Several late flights of objects over Portland were reported Friday
afternoon. **** of ********* avenue, said he saw three fly
east across the Willamette river near the Ross Island bridge about 2 p.m.
The objects did not appear high, he said, and were traveling so fast
that, appearing in the west, they were out of sight in the east in two to
four seconds. He said they resembled metallic disks glinting in the sunlight.
Later, he said, he and neighbors saw a single disk-like object flying
north far away and very high.

At 4:30 p.m., Mrs. * ** *****, *****, reported
sighting a disk "like a new dime flipping around" in the air over the Sandy
district. She said it seemed to be moving slowly.

PAPER RECOVERED.

****** ****** of ********* said he sighted two white or
silver objects flying southeast high over Portland a few minutes before
5 p.m. He reported another, headed northeast, over his home at 5:30 p.m.
********* *****, reported the first disk over his plant just Jefferson
at about 11 a.m. while he was driving near Redmond.

A piece of paper he said had fallen from a great height in the sky. Time of
its fall coincided with some of the reports of flying disks. The paper, of
low quality, measured 23½ x 36 inches.

UNCLASSIFIED
Officer McDowell stated that at approximately 1230, 4 July 1947 while
he was on duty at precinct #1 and feeding the pigeons in the parking
lot back of the station he noticed that the pigeons became quite excited
over something and fluttered in the air. Officer McDowell in looking
around to see what had disturbed them saw 5 large discs in the air east
of Portland; two discs flying south and three flying in an easterly direction.
He stated he could determine no color to the discs but advised they were
dipping in an up and down oscillating motion and were traveling at great
speed. He was unable to give an estimate of the speed or altitude of the
discs as they were out of sight before any detailed observation could be
made. Officer McDowell advised that he notified the Police Radio who
immediately broadcast an alert. He saw no indication of any motivating
force nor heard any sound coming from the discs and could give no description
other than round.

Here is the text from the document as requested:

Incident #5 -- Portland, Oregon -- 4 July 1947

There is no astronomical explanation for this, incident,
nor for numerous others (#6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16) which
occurred in and near Portland on the Fourth of July, 1947.

Besides being observed in the same vicinity and most of them
at the same time, the objects seen have in common a round shape, "ter-
rific" speed, abrupt tactics, and quick disappearance. Abrupt tactics
certainly suggest that the objects were of a very light weight.

This investigator can offer no definite hypothesis, but in
passing would like to note that these incidents occurred on the fourth
of July, and that if relatively small pieces of aluminum foil had
been dropped from a plane over that area, then any one object would
become visible at a relatively short distance. Even moderate wind 
velocities could give the illusion that fluttering, gyrating discs 
had gone by at great velocities. Various observers would now, of 
course, in this case have seen the same objects.

The above is not to be regarded as a very likely explana-
tion but only as a possibility the occurrence of these incidents 
on July 4 may have been more than a coincidence. Some prankster 
might have tossed such objects out of an airplane as part of an 
Independence Day celebration.

If these were aircraft of either known or unknown type,
