AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO.: A2102614
COUNTRY: United States
SUBJECT: FLYOB JET 
In accordance with AFR 205-1, dated 11 April 1952, subject: Unidentified Flying Objects, the following report is submitted:

On 22 May 1952, the pilot of a T-33 aircraft, stationed at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, reported that he encountered an unidentified flying object while on a routine training flight. The pilot stated that as he was flying at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet, he sighted an object which appeared to be a bright light. The object was moving at a high rate of speed and the pilot was unable to close on it or determine its size, shape or altitude. The object appeared to be silver or white in color. The pilot maintained visual contact with the object for approximately one minute, after which it disappeared from view.

The reliability of the informant is considered excellent.
