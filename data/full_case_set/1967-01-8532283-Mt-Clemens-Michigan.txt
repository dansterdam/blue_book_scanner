The document describes the sighting of a "dark gray colored, disk shaped object" that hovered at a low altitude and finally moved off very fast to the southeast. The Air Force was unable to analyze the original photographs as they were "not received" for evaluation.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a report discussing the analysis of a photograph. The text describes that the original photography would provide a basis for determining a range of sizes for the object, and that the object appeared to be further away from the observer than the helicopter, but the exact size of the object could not be determined.

The original text from the document is as follows:

The original photography would provide a basis for determining a range of sizes for the object. Knowing the size of the image within the photo format, the focal length of the camera and applying the observers reported range to the object from the camera a gross determination of size can be determined. 

The original photography would permit a comparison of edge sharpness between the helicopter and the unidentified object. It was reported that the object was further away from the observer than the helicopter. If this is true the edges on the object would not be as sharp as those of the helicopter. The measurements provided indicate that the object is nearer than the helicopter but we don't know if the measurements are at the same magnification, thereby ruling out this check on the reported information.

- page 2 -

The image contains several photographs that appear to be part of an investigation report. The report describes the investigation of a sighting location on the shore of Lake Saint Clair, just south of the Clinton River, where an object was reported as being "directly overhead."

Photograph #1 was taken with an identical camera (Polaroid Swinger) standing in the same location. The report states that the photograph shows the edge of the ice cut on the lake, and that the horizon and the object in the picture are not visible.

Photograph #2 was taken in the same spot with the lens at maximum opening.

Photograph #3 was taken with the lens at minimum opening.

Photograph #4 was taken to show the relationship of the pipe and tree to the observers. A diagram and measurements are shown on attachment #1.

The report also states that the family was reluctant to provide the original prints of their photographs, as they believed that "about 10 minutes after the pictures were taken, the numbering on the back of the prints indicated that at least one picture of the object was taken after a picture of the observers."

INVESTIGATION OF LOCATION OF SIGHTING

The area is on the shore of Lake Saint Clair just south of the mouth of the Clinton River. The pictures were taken through the 3/4 inch iron pipe structure shown in picture #3. The object was reported as being "directly overhead".

Picture #1 was taken with an identical camera (Polaroid Swinger) standing in the same spot. The photograph shows the edge of the ice cut on the lake. The horizon and the object in the picture are not visible.

Picture #2 was taken in the same spot with the lens at maximum opening.

Picture #3 was taken with the lens at minimum opening.

Picture #4 was taken to show the relationship of the pipe and tree to the observers. A diagram and measurements are shown on attachment #1.

BACKGROUND MATERIAL

The family was very reluctant to talk or give up the original prints of their pictures. They insisted that "about 10 minutes after the pictures were taken, the numbering on the back of the prints indicated that at least one picture of the object was taken after a picture of the observers."

Picture #1 was claimed lost, but they stated that it also showed the object. (It is the same as shown by this investigation.) Permission to examine the originals cannot be obtained. However, the originals were examined and it was stated that they showed no evidence of tampering or alteration.

ON JANUARY 6 A, 1960, THE DETROIT SUN-HERALD MAD HIS CLAIM THAT PHOTOGRAPHS OF A FLYING SAUCER OVER MOUNT CLEMENS, MICHIGAN, WERE TAKEN. THEIR PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRIKING. THAT PHOTOGRAPH IS BEING CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK WHICH COLLECTS ALL REPORTS FOR THE MILITARY, CONSIDERED IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS ANYTHING OF VALUE THAT COULD BE INFERRED FROM THE ALLEGED SGHTED OBJECT. CLARIFIED FACTS TAKEN LAST WEEK NEAR THE DETROIT SUBURB OF MOUNT CLEMENS.
THIS IS SO FAR DESC BUT DOES NOT SHOW ANY INDICATION OF AN OBVIOUS HOAX.
ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS, THE OBJECT WOULD BE DESCRIBED AS A ROUND PLATE SHAPED FIGURE, SILVER IN COLOR AND EXTREMELY BRILLIANT WHICH HAD VERTICAL PATTERNS ON ITS SURFACE AND ALSO 1b VISUAL DESCRIPTIONS I'VE TAKEN FROM EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNTS. 
NO REPORT HAS BEEN MADE OF THE SELECTION, WHICH MAS BE WITHHELD BY THE OWNER, UNTIL SCRUTINY IS COMPLETED WHICH SHOMLD BE IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS.
THE PICTURE BEING AS IT APPEARS TO BE, WAS TAKEN AROUND SAID P-M ON - JANUARY 6, - 1960. TWO COLOR PICTURES WERE ACTUALLY EXPOSED, WHICH WOULD SUPPORT A VISUAL DESCRIPTION OF THEIR SHAPE AND BRIGHTNESS.
ALL THE "EYEWITNESS" CLAIMS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE CAREFULLY EXAMINE ANY SIGHTED OBJECTS OR AIR FORCES WHICH THEY PERMITTED ON THE AREA THEY SAW THE. THEY WERE AFRAID THAT IT MIGHT BE SOME TOP SECRET MILITARY PROJECT, AND SO DID NOT TO LET THE AIR FORCE EXAMINE THE ORIGINAL PRINTS..

Attn: DR. J. T. RATCHFORD
REMARKS:
Dear Tom,
Please see if you can get some expert opinions with regards to the size of the alleged flying saucer. As you can see from the enclosed photo analysis report, our people at Wright-Patterson are very reluctant to offer a guess as to the actual size of the object. It is all possible pending expert analysis of the photographs. If your friend can come up with some additional measurements the only thing I will be able to give him is that the photo analysis indicates etc, etc, and I would not mention our evaluation. Any thanks for your help in this matter and let me know if you can conclude anything definite is derived from the photos please call and the paper work can follow later.
Thanks

TDET/UFO
UFO SIGHTING, 9 JANUARY 1967, MT. CLEMENS, MICHIGAN

1. Reference your request for information on an unidentified flying object sighting of 9 January 1967, Mt. Clemens, Michigan. The report was investigated by Major Nylus, Selfridge AFB, Michigan. Major Nylus has requested the original prints of the photographs taken, on three occasions, but Air Force officials have been reluctant to talk or permit the original prints to be viewed by the Air Force.

2. Analysis of the available photographs failed to provide any definite information pertaining to the identification of the unidentified object. The original photographs were examined by Draftsmen and experts of the Detroit News and provided by a reporter, Mr. [REDACTED], to sharpen the image. 

3. The original photographs would permit a comparison of edges and silhouette between the helicopter and the unidentified object. Witnesses reported that the object was further away from the observer than the helicopter. The measurements provided indicate that the object is smaller than the helicopter, but we do not know if this indication, therefore, ruling out this check on the reported information.

4. Contact was made with Dr. J. Allen Hynek regarding his statements which were carried over the wire service 16 January 1967. Dr. Hynek informed our office that he only told the Associated Press that the photographs appeared to be of an authenticity image. He claimed he has stated the photographs were apparently authentic.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with text only.

5. An evaluation of the original prints is essential in making a comprehensive evaluation on this sighting.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or memo summarizing a report from Major Hyla Seltsinger of the U.S. Air Force regarding a UFO sighting. The text describes the incident that occurred in Mount Clemens, Michigan, where Major Hyla Seltsinger witnessed a UFO while on patrol. The document mentions that the object was about a quarter of a mile away, and Major Hyla Seltsinger tried to capture it on camera but was unable to get clear pictures.

Memo for the Record
10 Jan 67
Call was received from Major Hyla Seltsinger APS, Selfridge (ex-3115) in regards to a UKO sighting over/like Sig. Clark. He stated they were out in the back yard. The object was about a quarter of a mile away and he attempted to take pictures, but he could not obtain clear data. Major Hyla said that he had contacted SARC! and told them of the sighting, the sighting should have a lot of public interest.

The image contains a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, a historic UFO investigation program. There does not appear to be any photograph present in this particular page. I will now transcribe the text from the document:

For the Record:
11 Jan 67

Contact was made with Major Hyla (ex-3115) in regards to the sighting reported on 7 Jan 67. He said that he had gone out to the scene of the sighting and had picked up copies of the original pictures. He said that the family was very cooperative and had given them the pictures. 

Major Hyla said that the pictures showed "a metallic bright object" which was 50 to 75 yards from the point where the picture was taken. The pipe and tree branches that were in one of the pictures were only about four feet from the camera. These two things were in fairly sharp focus. The camera would have been about 10 to 15 feet from the object.

There was ice on the lake which ruled out the possibility of the object being a boat but did not see any. The family back yard looked like a "junk yard" where Major Hyla looked around the yard for a similar object but could not find anything.

Major Hyla was asked to go back to the scene and take a picture which would come up by overnight US AFB courier to 6-33 aircraft at approximately 1900 hours. He said that he thought the photos could have been faked by changing something from the original picture. He would try to obtain the original pictures for our use.

22 Jan 67

Major Hyla called to say that he would try to obtain the original pictures. He was puzzled by the fact that the boys said that they saw all the pictures before the helicopter was low but according to the last picture, the object was "gone before the helicopter". Major Hyla also said that he had noticed a corrugated texture on the helicopter picture. The helicopter was surprise to be closer and higher than the alleged object.

Text extracted from the image:

Memo for the Record:
Major Hydo called from Selfridge AFB in regards to the 14 Jan 67 Major Hyles was convinced that this 26 Jan 67 sighting clearly took pictures of a UFO and a helicopter. The pictures clearly indicate that the helicopter picture was taken in the main of the pictures of the UFO. The numbering scheme on the photos indicate this fact to be true. The boys said that they saw the helicopter in the pictures. If this is a direct lie, he said the from his calculations, picture number 5 was taken from a circling position. The camera was definitely lower in picture 5 than the rest. The object in picture 5 is higher in relation to the helicopter than the other pictures. If the object had stayed at the same position, it would have been higher in the resulting condition.

Memo for the Record: 17 April 67
Conversation with Major Myls revealed that he made the model with about 2 inch diameter. The top and bottom was a darker gray. A four pound test monofilament was used to suspend the model. He built the model as close as he could to the actual photograph's alleged UFO.

STATEMENT

As of 1200P, 13 January 1967, I have been unable to obtain any of the original prints of the UFO sighted near Selfridge AFB on 9 January 1967.

On 10 January, I personally visited the site and requested these prints from the boys' Mother, Mrs.\Those M. , who stated that the did not have them in her possession., The boys' Father. The boys' Mother and Father are divorced.

On 11 January, I called Mrs.nd requested permission to re-visit the site and photograph for investigation purposes. Permission was granted, but I was still unable to obtain permission to visit the site was granted, but I was still unable to obtain the prints. Although I stated that the importance of these prints to our investigation, she stated that she would think about it and call me.

On 12 January, I was called by Mr.3ARRINGER, contacted by Mrs.who stated that he had talked with Mr.4, who stated that he and the boys' Mother had agreed to allow the Air Force to photograph the area. She stated that he thought the Air Force should not be granted access to this and she would think about it and let me know.

On 13 January, I called Mrs. to offer her a complete set of enlargements to exchange for one of the original prints. She stated she was supposed to visit a set of enlargements from the Detroit News but she would call me back.

I feel that further contact at this time would produce unfavorable results.

1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order Number 67-3 submitted by Major Quintanilla SAFOI, requesting photo analysis of the photographs of an unidentified flying object sighted near Lake St. Clair, Michigan. The photographs were received from Major Nylls, Selfridge AFB, Michigan along with Major Nylls' investigative report.
2. ANALYSIS: Analysis of the available photography fails to provide any definitive information pertaining to the identification of the unidentified object. The original photography is inadequate to ascertain whether or not a fruitful analysis can be made.
