SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS:

1. A check with the Hamilton Flight Service Center was made by Det. 1, 4602D AISS, for aircraft or balloons in the area at the time of sighting. Negative results.

2. The LICK OBSERVATORY, located on MT HAMILTON (D.PH 2320), was contacted for any unusual astronomical phenomena during that period with negative results.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, specifically the "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" form.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the document, the text reads as follows:

AF FORM 112â€”PART II UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PAGE 2 OF 4 PAGES

I. SOURCES:
Address: Camp Pomponio, California
Age: 38
Occupation: Camp Ranger, BSA
Education: Two (2) years high school
Qualifications: Unknown

II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: SOURCE had served four (4) years with the US Navy as a cook on a destroyer, with additional duty as a gun-pointer on a 20mm gun. SOURCE tried to be exact and precise in the observing the details and emphasize the visual reports and statements.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE was informed by his wife that, "what that thing was there again?" as she was out gathering in her clothes. The object which may have varied or changed the weather, took on all a brilliant greenish-bluish color, object was brighter than any stars in the sky, with the naked eye it appeared to be about the size of a hair, with a steady glow and a luminous-form, one end appeared to be curved and was V-shaped or blunt-ended. SOURCE obtained a good look as the object passed through the periscope of a power Navy type periscope. When viewed through the periscope the object appeared to have diminished in size but retained its brilliant green color and luminous-form. SOURCE observed the object for approx 20 minutes KOPPUT NAVAL AIR STATION, CALIFORNIA, JUNK 5724. During a time lapse of approx 30 minutes, SOURCE returned to check the object and by use of a compass ascertained that the object had moved to 195-100 degrees. SOURCE observed the object for approx one (1) hour and when he viewed the object was in the ENE direction approx 30 degrees.

SOURCE had observed a similar occurrence from 16090OZ - 16100OZ Nov 55, at which time he sighted two (2) objects, but believing them to be stars did not report the sightings at that time.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a "SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112" document.

The text in the document is as follows:

ORIGINATING AGENCY
Det 1, 6602d AISS

REPORT NO.
DL-103B-55

PART THREE
PAGES 4 - 4

GIST of Preparing Officer:
1. In the opinion of the preparing officer, this sighting was probably caused by an unknown planet shining through a thin layer of clouds, giving it a distorted effect. (Some clouds were reported by Dr. Officer of the USAF Observatory.)
2. The star Ceres also fits the circumstances of this case; however, since its movement is in the wrong direction, from the southeast diagonally toward the northeast, the direction becomes reversed from that of Ceres' sighting.
3. Inasmuch as no astronomical reason existed for this sighting, and no balloon or aircraft control devices could be located, the conclusion drawn is that it was probably caused by a natural atmospheric phenomenon, possibly a mirage, causing the view to become distorted.

ANTHONY H. DESANCTISCO
Captain, USAF
Asst Officer In Charge

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sighting was astronomical in nature and was probably caused by the star Betelgeuse rather than an unknown planet.
