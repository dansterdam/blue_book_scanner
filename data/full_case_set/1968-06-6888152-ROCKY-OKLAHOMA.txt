An illuminated "object", glowing and very bright in the center, with a great many white lights bordering the outer edge, appeared in the western sky. The "craft" or lights were rotating in a counter-clockwise direction. When silent when close by. The lights appeared to fluctuate and then silent again.  Movement appeared to be guided, not erratic. They were observed for 2-3 minutes and then disappeared. Cause of sighting is not known. No aircraft in vicinity.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD 25 JUNE 1968

Subj: UFO Observation, 19 June 1968

Mr. [REDACTED] said that he really couldn't say too much since he didn't know what type of counter was being used but did say that concentrations of 100-10,000 disintegrations/min/sq. centimeter requires the use of a gas mask. He suggested that I contact the base Health Physics Officer or have local H. P. Officer measure with STAPLEX. Called [REDACTED] office and was referred to No. 76231 where he was at the time. Mr. [REDACTED] stated that without information such a background count and type of instrument (including Army Navy Portable Detector No.) he really couldn't say if the radiation was hazardous or not.

Suggested that I call the base/land State Health Physics Officer accompany and make measurements on count.
If that is impossible find out:
1. If instrument is properly calibrated.
2. If Capt. Leonard is familiar with the use of the instrument.
3. Type and make of instrument (including ANPDR #).
4. Background count.
5. If they are getting reading from
A. An object
B. General area
6. If object, take several readings at various distances from
object.
7. If area, take several measurements at various distances from
the area.

There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from an old report document, possibly related to a UFO investigation or Project Blue Book.

8. Take a reading with the window of counter open and closed at each point.

9. If object, see if radiation is transferrable. Rub paper towel (folded) remove from area and see if towel now is radioactive. 
If radiation is transferrable, shower immediately after leaving area and wear rubber gloves when working in area.
Mr. Lewis wants us to call him back.

21 June 1968
Subj: UFO Observation & Investigation, 19 June 1968
At 0920 hours Lt Garmon Marano, Aerial Phenomena Office, telephoned Captain Leonard at Clinton Sherman AFB, Oklahoma. Capt Leonard was not in at the time and Lt Marano's call was transferred to extension 6205. 
Sgt Towns. The only thing that Sgt Towns knew about the observation was what was in the TWX. He said that Capt Leonard had done the investigation. Lt Marano asked Sgt Towns to have Capt Leonard call Lt Marano since he, Lt M, needed the following information. What type of radiac instrument was he using? The Register #? If it has been calibrated lately? Was he familiar with the instrument? Were the readings from the background of the area? Did he take the readings from a particular object or from the general area? Lt Marano requested that Sgt Towns return Lt Marano's call if Capt Leonard would be unable to be reached in one and one-half hours. Sgt Towns said he would have Capt Leonard call Lt Marano and that he would return the call if Capt Leonard could not be reached.

Subj: UFO Observation, 19 June 1968
Lt Downey called on 21 June 1968 at 1135 hrs to say that disaster control had checked the area and that there is only normal background activity. I asked Lt Downey to check local police, state police, and local at Hobart, Cordell etc. and see if they received any reports. See if local radars tracked anything either identified or unidentified at or near the time of the sighting. I also asked him to transmitt all the above information (including statement that there was no abnormal radio activity in the area) to us. I also told him that in the future they should also transmitt a 7DX to the University of Colorado in accordance to 80-17A but that I would do it for this case.

jet aircraft and was approximately 200 feet in diameter
and was a light yellow color in the center and a blue-
white color around the edge - the object was motionless
for over 15 minutes - the object then started slowly moving
east for about 30 seconds and then shot straight up and out
of sight - the object did not make any noise and there was no
trail of any kind -
so the object hovered a little but not much. Mrs.

1. Under the provisions of AFR 80-17, Investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects, a report was made on 19 June 1968, at Clinton Sherman AFB and 4 miles South & 2 miles East of Clin ton Oklahoma by Captain S. Leonard Jr., 70th Bomb Wing SAC (DOGO) Clinton Sherman AFB, Oklahoma 73632, to examine all aspects of the allegation made by 2 Farm Hands that a UFO was sighted by them at approximately 0630 hours, 19 June 1968.

2. The investigation is accompanied by pictures, letters of certification and AFR 80-17 (Gl) questionnaires, on sighting of unidentified phenomena from personnel investigative of the 2 farm hands by Captain Leonard, at the sight of the phenomena. A radioactivity check was made in the area with negative results.

3. Conclusions reached by my limited knowledge in this investigation are inconclusive. The only determination of cause I would suggest is a conclusion of that weather and a probable object from course route by the area.

I was appointed investigating officer on the afternoon of 19 June 1968 for a UFO sighting that occurred on a farm approximately 10 miles SSE of Clinton Sherman Air Force Base that belongs to Mr. [redacted] of Rill City, Okla. Mrs. [redacted], son [redacted] and his cousin [redacted] witnessed the sighting while they were unloading hay from a truck into a barn behind the farmhouse. Information received by [redacted] at this station approximately 1530 hours 19 June.

I made contact at 0800 hours the 20th with LSGT woods, Officer of Clinton-Sherman AFB Base Operations and obtained assistance in calling local agencies dealing with aircraft and surrounding air bases. Mr. [redacted] of Hobart Radio Flight Service Station was talked to and he said he had a Piper Aztec at 4,500' at 1603Z over Hobart on V272 to Oklahoma City VOR. ALG base from Base Operations at Altus AFB related he had no traffic in the area operational between 0930Z and 1000Z on the 19th. Dr. [redacted] at Fort Sill Operations says he had no traffic in the area at the time of the sighting and was asked specifically if he had helicopters operating...answer negative.

Mr. [redacted] and Mr. [redacted] on duty in Operations at Tinker AFB, OKLA. at the time said there was no traffic in our vicinity at the time of the sighting. A weather synopsis was made by Clinton-Sherman Weather and is attached as well as the report from the Radar Center. At approximately 1000 hours the 20th, I made a field survey with Disaster Control of the sight and interviewed the 2 individuals and took the attached photos of the area. Disaster Control found no radioactivity after they returned to base and calibrated their instruments which were the GEIGER counter and then proceeded to the sight. A copy was sent out to flight Patterson on the afternoon of the 20th and this follows the formal investigation is forwarded for further analysis at your discretion. I can determine no cause for the sighting with information I have correlated.

- page 26 -

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch is a compass rose diagram that instructs the observer to place an "X" at the center of the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when first seen, and then place an "A" on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when last seen.

The second sketch depicts two landscapes, labeled A and B, which appear to illustrate the movement or change in the position of the phenomenon between the "A" and "B" points on the compass.

Text:
AFR 80-17(C1)
6A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION SEEN WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS.

Dear Sir:

On the evening of May 22, 1968, my husband and I were driving home from Rocky, Oklahoma. As we came around a curve in the road, we saw two strange figures standing in the ditch by the side of the road. 

The figures were approximately 6 feet tall and appeared to be wearing some type of clothing. One figure was wearing a long, flowing robe or cloak and the other was wearing a white shirt with the word "MOTHER" printed on the front.

We slowed down to get a better look at the strange figures, but as we approached, they suddenly disappeared. We drove to the spot where we had seen them, but there was no trace of them.

I am enclosing a sketch that my husband made of the two figures. I hope this information is helpful to your investigation. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
XXXXXXXX XXXXXX

UFO Observation, 19 June 1969

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object (UFO) report from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma which occurred on 19 June 1969 (sighting is about 10 miles north of Robert).

2. Although the sighting occurred sometime between 1:15 and 2:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time, the description is very similar to the electrical aerial advertising sign which appears to be the Piper Aztec at 4500' at 10032Z over Radio KWT. 

3. Since you own a Piper Aztec, we were wondering if your plane could have been in the area and possibly turned off for several minutes thus causing the UFO sighting. If your plane was not in the area at the time of the sighting, please let us know.

4. Thank you for any assistance you can provide.

1. The enclosed photograph is in response to a written unidentified
flying object (UFO) report from Rocky, Oklahoma, which occurred on
19 June 1968. (Rocky is about 10 miles north of Hobart.)

2. Although the sighting occurred sometime between 4:15 and 5:00 am 
Central Daylight Time, the description is very similar to that
of a traditional aerial advertising sign.

3. We were wondering if your plane could have been in the area and 
possibly turned the lights on for several minutes, thus causing the
UFO sighting. If your plane was not in the area, do you know of any
unusual aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.

4. Thank you for any assistance you can provide.

Report of call to the Troys-Sighting at Rocky, Oklahoma.
Date of Sighting: June 19, 1968.

A call was placed to the USAF on Tuesday, September 17, 1968 in Rocky, Oklahoma.

Operator: Can you tell me how he came to the phone?
Answer: He is here.
Operator: Can we talk to him? Long distance calling. Is this Brent?
Yes.
Operator: Go ahead, please.
Hynek: Hello, this is Prof. Hynek at Northwestern University. Did you get my letter?
Yes.
Hynek: Fine. He's not down here any more. He's in college.
As I said in the letter, I am very much interested in your sighting and I wonder if you could answer a few questions about it?
I'll try.
Hynek: Which one are you, the younger or the older?
I'm the younger. Jerry is not here because he is in college.
Hynek: Is he your cousin?
Yes, he is my cousin.
Hynek: Where is he in college?
In Western Oklahoma.
Hynek: Well, okay then. As long as I've got you on the line I might as well talk with you and I can call Jerry later. This all happened on June 19, 1968, is that right? So it is not too far back. What first called your attention to it?
It sounded like a helicopter at first. I guess that is why I looked up at first. So why don't we just do it this way. You take a deep breath and let's go over the whole thing again and just describe what happened.
Hynek: Well, when I first looked up there I saw it all lit up. There was noise there but then I heard the noise quit. How bright was it?

It was all lit up. There were lights all around it, and in a few minutes it disappeared. 

Hynek: Did you ever see anything like it before?
No, never did.

Hynek: If you held your hand out in front of you, how much of the object would it have covered up?
Oh, well, not very much.

Hynek: Well, it was really very big then?
Pretty big.

Hynek: Did it ever pass in front of anything or in back of anything?
Well, let's see, it came over the barn but I don't believe it passed in front of anything or in back of anything. 

Hynek: How high would you have to raise your arm to point directly at it when it was at its highest?
Not too high.

Hynek: So it was fairly close to the horizon then?
Pretty close.

Hynek: Did it have sharp edges or did it have fuzzy edges?
Quite sharp.

Hynek: What was the color of the light?
Just white lights.

Hynek: Did it ever change color?
No, not at all.

Hynek: Now, if you had a tractor light, or an automobile headlight in front of you, how far would you have to be from the light to have the same brightness? About a block, or something like that?
About a block or two blocks maybe. It wasn't too big.

Hynek: About the same size, I'd say. The whole object you mean?
Yes, the whole object. What impressed you most about it, what was the thing that struck you the most?
The brightness of it.

Hynek: What did you think it was?
I didn't know what it was. It scared me at first.

Hynek: Do you think it could have been a balloon, or something like that?

- page 57 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, with text describing a conversation between two individuals, Hynek and someone else.

Text from the document:

No, it was not balloon or nothing like that. It was all lit up and there was noise first and then it split.
How close do you think it got to you?
I would say between 50 and 100 feet.
But there were no trees around so you could judge its actual distance.
No, there were no trees.
Yes, that's right. I have the pictures in front of me and it is pretty plain that there were not too many people. How many people did you tell about this?
We didn't tell nobody right then. After that we told quite a few.
Actually, we didn't tell nobody after that.
How long before you decided not to tell anybody?
The next day after that.
I am always interested in knowing what people think about these unidentified persons who have seen something like this. How did you happen to make the report in the first place?
We thought it was helicopters at first, from the Cannon Air Force Base so we called and they said there was no helicopters up then.
Did they say they had anything on radar?
No, they said there was no airplanes or nothing out that night.
What was the sky itself like, was it clear? Or, was it cloudy?
Clear, I believe.
Was the moon up?
Yes, there was some moon.
What part of the sky was the moon in?
I don't remember about that.
Well, was it high up or was it low down?
Fairly high.
Well, let me ask, was the moon in the same part of the sky as this object?
No, it wasn't.
And you were looking what -- west?
No, we were looking east. It came from the southeast.

Hynek: How long did the whole thing last?
Response: About three or four minutes.

Hynek: And in what way did it disappear?
Response: Well, I don't know, it just disappear'd. We were looking at it and it was gone.  

Hynek: You mean it went out like a light bulb?
Response: It just went out, like that.

Hynek: Could you actually make out any outlines or was the light so bright that you couldn't see any outlines?
Response: I couldn't tell about any edge or anything, it was just round.

Hynek: Did the light go all over the edges?
Response: It looked like it did.

Hynek: So if there was any actual object there, you probably couldn't have seen it, is that right?
Response: I guess not.

Hynek: So as far as you are concerned, it was basically a light?
Response: Yes, with lights all around it.

Hynek: Do you have any idea how many lights? Were you frightened at all?
Response: Well, right at first, I didn't know what it was. I saw my cousin and he seen it too.

Hynek: Did it have any effect on the animals?
Response: Well, the dogs started barking. I didn't notice anything about the cows, but the dogs started barking.

Hynek: Well, do you think they were barking at it or something else?
Response: I don't know, but that was the only thing around to bark at.

Hynek: What did your parents think about all this when you told them?
Response: Well, it kind of scared them. They didn't know what to think about it.

Hynek: Had they ever seen anything like it?
Response: No.

Hynek: You don't know of anyone else who saw it that night?
Response: No, I guess there weren't many people up at 4 o'clock in the morning.

Hynek: How come you were up that early?
Response: We were hauling hay.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a transcript of a telephone conversation or interview regarding a UFO sighting.

Hynek: I see. Is there anything else about it you think I really ought to know?
I believe that is about all.
Hynek: Did it ever actually stop still for awhile?
Well, it stopped for about a second and then it moved, and it moved on around the horizon.
Hynek: Well, now, how long did the sound last and how long was it?
Well, let's see, it lasted, I did would say, about 30 seconds.
Hynek: I haven't the least idea what it was that you saw, but there have been other reports like it. We are trying to figure out what it is.
You don't have any idea what it was?
Hynek: No, I don't.
I don't know what it could be.
Hynek: How many of your friends your own age did you tell about it?
Pretty near everybody knew about it afterwards.
Hynek: No, they never did get hold of it;
That's good. But some woman put it in the paper, but we never did.
Hynek: Well, thanks very much for the information, and you say that is at college right now? What town is this in the Southwestern Oklahoma?
Weatherford, Oklahoma.
Hynek: You don't happen to have his address, do you?
Well, you know the other man in the report, well, that's his.
Hynek: I'd give him a ring there and see if I can find him.
Well, he ought to be home right now.
Hynek: All right, I'll give him a ring and see what happens. Thank you very much. Goodbye.
Hynek: I'd like to put in a person-to-person call to Mr. ---- located in Weatherford, Oklahoma, and the number is ----.
Operator: Hello, is Mr. ---- there? Long distance is calling.
Hynek: Hello, Mr. ----. This is Dr. Hynek from Northwestern University calling...I think you may have gotten a letter from me or your cousin did mention that you had a nice long talk with him, and I wonder if you could answer a few questions.

OCR output:

Yes, I'll be happy to.

Hynek: Can you speak up a little louder because I can hardly hear you. Now, let's see, did that object make any noise?

Hynek: Yes, it did. First, it sounded like a helicopter approaching.

Hynek: I think it was altogether about five minutes.

Hynek: The sound - uh huh.

Hynek: And was there any time it didn't have the sound?

Hynek: After a while, the helicopter sound turned into more of a whine.

Hynek: So, it was noisy all the time?

Hynek: Yes, sir.

Hynek: Now - he seemed to indicate that it was noisy for only about 30 seconds. Then, he didn't make any noise. 

Well, I heard it longer than that for sure. I believe I heard it for a good while.

Hynek: How did you first happen to see it?

Hynek: Did he looked scared?

Hynek: Yeah, he was scared, he was real scared. That's the reason he was scared about.

Hynek: Well, tell you what, let's do it this way. Let's take it from the point where you first happened to see it and you tell me in your own words just how it happened.

After he saw it?

Hynek: Yes. And after you saw it - first then.

Well, I popped out and he headed for back of the barn. I just happened to glance up at that direction and I seen the object.

Hynek: I thought maybe at first it was just an airplane. I didn't know. I was shocked, too. I didn't know what it was.

Hynek: Well, I think it was. Yeah, I know it was. Okay, I am not questioning you. I just want to get a description. Now let's get at how big it seemed to be. How did it compare in size to the full moon?

(PAUSE) WHEN IT WAS QUITE AWAYS OFF IT SEEMED PRETTY SMALL. 
WHEN IT GOT CLOSE ENOUGH YOU COULD TELL IT WAS FAIRLY LARGE. WELL, I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T ESTIMATE HOW BIG IT REALLY WAS SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW FAR AWAY IT WAS, BUT ANYWAY, HOW FAR AWAY DO YOU THINK IT WAS WHEN IT WAS THE CLOSEST?
WHEN IT WAS CLOSE, IT WAS PRETTY BIG, AND I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
NOW IT SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT IT NEVER GOT VERY HIGH IN THE SKY AND THAT IT WAS ALWAYS CLOSE TO THE HORIZON. IS THAT CORRECT?
WELL, WHEN I FIRST SAW IT, IT WAS PRETTY HIGH, AND IT WAS COMING AT AN ANGLE TOWARDS US, AND THEN IT GOT HIGH UP WHEN I LOOKED.
HOW COME YOU NEVER SAW IT LEAVE?
WELL, I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO CRASH OR SOMETHING, AND I HEADED BACK INTO THE BARN, TOO.
OH, I SEE, SO BOTH OF YOU HEADED INTO THE BARN?
WELL, YES, SIR, THAT'S RIGHT. I DON'T BLAME YOU AT ALL, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN SCARED, TOO. WHAT COLOR WAS IT?
OH, IT WAS JUST LUMINOUS, YOU KNOW. 
OH, YES. HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU TELL ABOUT IT, AND WHAT DID THEY THINK?
WELL, THE FIRST THING I DID WHILE IT WAS THERE - SO WE HAD TO TAKE IT PRETTY EASY, I REMEMBERED - WE HAVE A DOG, AND HE SHOOK UP, BUT HE WAS JUST LAUGHING ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT. (PAUSE BUT AT THIS POINT) 
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE?
NEVER HAVE.
WOULD YOU WANT TO?
NOW THAT IT HAPPENED I WOULD SORT OF LIKE TO HAVE A PICTURE JUST TO PROVE THAT I SAW IT.
WELL, THAT WOULD BE AWFULLY NICE OF COURSE. I THINK OF PEOPLE BELIEVE ME.
IN THE REPORT I DIDN'T GET A PICTURE OF THE OBJECT. I DO HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS, THE GENERAL LANDSCAPE, BUT I NEVER DID GET A DRAWING OF THE OBJECT ITSELF. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SKETCH IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND SEND IT TO ME, THE ADDRESS HERE IS VERY SIMPLE. IT IS SIMPLY THE ASTRONAUT DEPARTMENT NORTHWEST NORTHEAST, AND THAT WOULD BE ALL. I'D LIKE TO SEE IT, AND ALSO, LET ME HAVE ANY OTHER THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO ADD. JUST SEE WHAT WAS THE SKY LIKE, WAS THE MOON OUT?
WELL, IT WAS PARTLY CLOUDY IN THE WEST AND CLEAR IN THE EAST.
THE MOON WAS OUT, I BELIEVE, A LITTLE BIT, AND I BELIEVE IT WAS THE MOON.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a transcript of a conversation or interview related to the Project Blue Book investigation of a UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

Hynek: The reason I asked I just wanted to see how it compared in size. Now, as far as brightness is concerned, if you took an automobile headlight, let's say, how far away would you have to put it to have an object about that size and brightness? 
Hynek: Well, it wasn't bright enough to blind you or anything like that. It was just lit up.
Hynek: Was it dim enough so that you could make out anything that the light was attached to?
Hynek: Well, if there were lights on the outside, and the middle was sort of glowing.
Hynek: About how many lights were there altogether? As I really couldn't tell how many.
Hynek: Okay, well, did it ever really stand still at any time? Well, it not more than just a couple of seconds.
Hynek: How close do you think it was to the ground when it was the closest?
Well, there was a telephone pole out there and it seemed to be just about right over that.
Hynek: What impressed you most about the whole thing? Well, I guess the fact that it wasn't an airplane. It was some other object.
Hynek: Now, when you did tell other people, did they believe you, or did they think you were making it up to get some attention?
Well, the fellows that come out checked around for radiation, you know, and they were pretty sure it was just something we were just making up to get some publicity.
Hynek: How did it get to the attention of the Air Force? I told them about it. They were coming and asked her if she heard anything about it, you know, to sort of back me up about it, and she called up there and told them about it.
Who came out to see you?  Somebody from the Air Force base came out.
Hynek: And is he the one who took the pictures? Yes, he took the pictures and asked the questions.
Hynek: I'm glad he did and I'm glad he treated you nicely. Well, I guess there's nothing too much more I can ask you. I'll think it over a little more and try to draw what I saw. I wish you would, and send it to me, and you might have some other things you did would like to add -- after all, it was several months ago.

Yeah, I know. I never heard anything about it and I just figured the doggoned thing probably cared about it.
Hynek: No, we do care about it, but there is a great deal of work to do. You just have my address, don't you, to send this stuff to. I'd appreciate your sending this to very much because we are doing our best to try and make sense out of all of these down.
Well, I'll tell you what, the way the guys acted out here, I thought maybe they had something up they weren't telling us about.
Hynek: No, I don't believe that was the case.
Well, that is the way they acted.
Hynek: You mean the guys from the Air Force?
Yeah.
Hynek: Let me ask you one other thing. How long would you say you were really a frightened by the things you saw? Did it affect your sleep or your dreams or anything like that?
Well, it really shook us up about two weeks. I've been having trouble getting to sleep. I believe in them now.
Hynek: Have you done much reading about UFOs?
Sure have since then. And, I'm going to take some astronomy.
Hynek: Well, that's good, maybe we will see you here at Northwestern sometime, who can tell. Well, fine, keep up your interest in astronomy and please do get that sketch to me as soon as you can.
Okay, you'll be getting it right soon. Thanks for calling.
