GROUND LIGHTS
Round reddish orange or glowing light, believed to be about 270 degrees in azimuth and 45 degrees in altitude. The light appeared to be about 8 inches in diameter. It would disappear for 2-3 seconds and reappear on the ground or a few feet off the ground. The light was observed to be resembling "fluorescent lights" and these circles may represent lights or some sort of pulsation or observation in the area between mountains.
COMMENTS: Ground lights were observed to light from flashlight or other such solid body. Possibly these lights from hunters in the woods, some similar lights were observed.

Dear Sir,

The adjustment of Mr. B. J. and related matters to be discussed again the following information.

On January 25, 1965 around 11:15 PM we saw a round reddish-orange object over Bolar, Virginia "East Office" Then against around 10:45 PM January 25, 1965 the object appeared again in the same place. Both times it hovered and watch for at least 45 minutes at a time. It emitted flashing lights that appeared to be either blue or green in color. The night was clear and the object appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet or less. It would sudden disappear and then reappear in the same general area. We could not tell if it was on the ground or hovering. The ground underneath was wooded and we could not see any details...

Recently some newspapers and television sets have learned that an unidentified flying object was observed over the city of Bolar, Virginia and due to these reports, thanks have been played by leading citizens. I can truthfully say and I do not consider it a figuring matter. The small village of Bolar is located in a sparse area and is closely guarded. The residents there are cautious about discussing sightings in our area that would make the headlines when they do occur, and are reluctant to discuss the details of what was observed. I hesitate before reporting this subject as the postal inspector, who after his review, did not consider it a reportable incident to the Project Blue Book authorities. I did however not feel that these questions were the highest aspect of the matter.

Sincerely,
Mrs. Josephine D. Randolph
