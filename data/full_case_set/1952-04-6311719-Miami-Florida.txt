AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SIGHTING OF UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT
MIAMI, FLORIDA
19 APRIL 1952
JOHN H. SHARPE, MAJOR, USAF
CIVILIAN OBSERVER
ACCOUNT: At about 2115 EST on 19 Apr 1952, an object was observed by the witness as follows: The object was first seen in the west at about 45 degrees elevation. It appeared as a point of light, similar to a star, but much brighter. It moved on a level, straight course, at a very high speed, estimated to be approximately 1000-1500 mph. It was observed for about 30 seconds, then suddenly disappeared. The witness stated that there was no exhaust or trail, and the object did not vary its speed or make any turns during the observation. The appearance and disappearance was very abrupt. The witness is a civilian observer residing in Miami, Florida, and has had experience in observing conventional aircraft. He was certain that the object observed was not a conventional aircraft.

The text on the document describes an incident where an observer reported seeing an unidentified object that appeared to be flying in formation with a number of conventional aircraft. The observer stated that the object was flying at a significantly higher speed and altitude than the conventional aircraft. The report indicates that the observer was disappointed because they were unable to get a better look at the object as it disappeared from view. The report also notes that no other persons have reported sighting the same object.

The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch or diagram depicting a circular object with the text "FADE OUT AT EDGE" written above it. There is also a numerical value of "9.1.5" written below the sketch.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract the text from the document:
