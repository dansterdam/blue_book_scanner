Project Blue Book Investigation Report
27 July 1964
This is to report several phenomena which occurred at Whitesboro, New York, on the evening of July 26, 1964 at approximately 9:30 P.M. The first observation was made by a group of people. On the evening of July 26, 1964, at approximately 9:30 P.M. a group of people observed an object in the sky. This object was described as being round and seemed to change color from a reddish glow to a bright white light. The object moved rapidly and disappeared over the eastern horizon.

This is the general direction.

On the following night, at about 9:00 P.M. the object was sighted again by the observers. The object moved rapidly and ascended in the western sky, increasing in speed and disappearing from sight. 

It also passed and accelerated at a tremendous speed. The resemblance of the two sightings were identical and seemed to corroborate the information.

Later that night two of these spotted object were observed. The other of these strange objects was watching the way for about 10 minutes, when it appeared to disappear in the west. The object was 10:03 P.M., when it appeared on the western sky and proceeded very low on the horizon until it disappeared in the south west. The first two almost exactly the same speed. However, at one point three one seemed to pause as had the other.

Could it be possible to explain this again in the light of the objects as a real event and consideration in reading this letter.

Yours Truly,
[Signature redacted]

1. The following letter from Mr. to the U. S. Air Force
on 27 July 64. It is believed that the observer observed some objects on the night of 25 July 64 at Whitesboro, New York, on the night of 25 July 64 at 9:15 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. 
It is suggested that an echo schedule for the night of 27 July 64 from 9:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. be obtained in order to correlate this with his observations.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed letter dated August 17, 1964 from Major Mason M. Jacks of the USAF Office of Information Division to a Mr. [redacted] in Whitesboro, New York. The letter discusses several objects that were observed in the sky on the evenings of July 25 and 26, 1964 over Whitesboro.

Text from the document:

August 17, 1964

Dear Mr. [redacted]:

1964. This is in reply to your letter of July 27, 1964, concerning several objects observed in the sky on the evenings of both July 25th and 26th.

It is believed that the objects you observed were some 150 miles distant over Whitesboro, New York on the night of July 25th, at approximately 9:51 p.m. When first seen, they were just visible in the northeast, remaining stationary for about 20 minutes, then appearing to move closer together and fade from view.

They probably gave the appearance of being station-ary and sheen flashing up since they were so distant, the details and viewing them from the ground made accurate observation difficult.

Until they can be studied down in more detail upon recurrence, it must remain an unexplained sighting, but one that is commonly reported.

Sincerely,

MASON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information

Mr. [redacted]
Whitesboro, New York
