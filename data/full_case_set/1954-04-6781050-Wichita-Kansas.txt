A RAF British Air ministry policy report states on 5 January 1954 that unidentified flying objects have been observed over the Wichita, Kansas area. The report indicates that these sightings were officially referred to the Air Ministry, and the RAF has consulted the USAF regarding these sightings. The report discusses five sightings that occurred on 6 January 1954, with the objects described as moving erratically at high speeds. The report notes that these sightings were confirmed by several civilian and military witnesses. The ministry indicates that the objects were tracked on radar for periods up to 2 minutes, and could perform maneuvers that were beyond the capabilities of known aircraft at the time. The ministry concludes that the nature and performance of the objects is unexplained, and they have forwarded the details to the appropriate authorities for further investigation.
