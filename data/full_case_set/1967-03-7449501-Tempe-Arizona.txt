The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a sketch and diagram. The sketch shows an aerial view of an object or objects, with the observer's position and the object's path indicated. The diagram shows the object's position relative to the compass directions. There are also some handwritten notes discussing the object's motion and arrangement.

As an OCR system, the text I can extract from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the compass where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you last saw it.
90°
75°
60°
45°
30°
15°
0°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
(Right to left 2 objects in a bright light, no shape other than a bright light. Over the field - hovering - then the 2 shots - raced each other at a terrific rate - came together and it appeared that one object absorbed the other - then it appeared that there were not 2 but one object at a very fast speed - tremendous stove - a fiery glow. Possibility - ??? observing the effect of its movements.)

Ref. 13-C. After I had been watching the four to a while, one seemed to go out of another look at me as I was watching, and the light seemed to drop under it. watching again with binoculars I could seem to be turning off and on at irregular intervals. At a distance of 13 yards, the total light was diminished again, Glasses again in check with eyes only one and the impression was that the light was going on and off, at shorter intervals and it appears to be down to just one source or noise, and this suddenly went out watching them. This seemed to distinguish a kelving or rillain balloonreflecting light - can't tell by this time the object had drifted further and was at high altitude and was almost lost to view, had been on the NW when first observed.

Decrease in the in the Brighter with Capt. 1) USAF indicates that this was is at low altitude corresponding to bright light accompanied by an object. The effect of motion would be the light glitter that would be the usual clue to look through clear or milky path.

there gradually disappeared out of sight, the light appeared to be in the shape of a ball. That is how it disappeared. When last seen it was approx. 4:15-4:20 minutes.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?

A reddish orange glowing mass that seemed to be behind a light cloud or haze. It was clearly distinguishable from the cloud.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object. How much of the object is covered by the head of the match? If you had not performed this experiment, estimate the size.
I believe it cannot be match sized. It would cover approx. of 5 to 10 fingers at arms length.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your drawing any of the following that you observed: wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
Sketch of oval/football shaped object showing trajectory. "Disappeared at end of trail."

No motion was observed. The night was clear and the object appeared to be metallic in nature. It was high in the sky but lower than the stars and estimated to be approximately 5-10 miles away.
