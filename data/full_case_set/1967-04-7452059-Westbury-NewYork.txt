34: Date you completed this questionnaire: 1 21 / 6 / 

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire as a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The object I saw was a Circular shape object silver in color, about the size of a small automobile. It had a distinct outline, not hazy or blurred. It moved at a very rapid pace and high altitude. It was seen by my wife and myself while driving along the Southern State Parkway near Westbury, New York. The object appeared suddenly and disappeared from view in a matter of seconds. There were no flashing lights or sounds associated with the object. It seemed to travel with no apparent effort or power source. We were both amazed at what we saw and could not explain it as any conventional aircraft. The sighting lasted less than a minute.

Dear Sir:
I have come across a copy of a letter to your office dated April 15, 1967. The writer reports seeing a U.F.O. on April 3, 1967. The letter is from Westbury, New York and states that the writer's son and a friend observed a U.F.O. for about 10 minutes, and the son even took some photographs. However, when the film was developed, the pictures did not come out clearly and showed only a hazy object. The writer states that the boy's friend was also able to see the U.F.O.
The letter describes the U.F.O. as being about 4:30 p.m., when the boys first noticed it. It was a bright, metallic object, about the size of a basketball, hovering at an altitude of about 300 feet. It remained stationary for several minutes, then suddenly took off at a high rate of speed, disappearing from sight within 2 or 3 seconds. The letter goes on to say that the boys were very frightened by the experience. It concludes by stating that the writer is sending this information in the hope that it may be of some use to your office. The writer requests that the original letter and any photographs be returned, if possible.
