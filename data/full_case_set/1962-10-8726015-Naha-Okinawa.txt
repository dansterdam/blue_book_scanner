NAHA (OKINAWA) 
8 OCTOBER 1962 
CASE NO. 62-10872
FINAL EVALUATION - PROBABLY EXPLAINABLE PHENOMENON 
1. This case is based on a report from USAF authorities on Okinawa concerning sightings on 8 October 1962. 
2. The first sighting occurred at 1730 hours when a number of round unidentified objects were observed flying high and fast in a south-north direction over Okino Erabu Shima. Airman 1st Class M. A. Pringle and two other airmen at Kadena Air Force Base observed the objects through binoculars. The objects appeared to be dark in color and flying at an estimated altitude of 40,000 feet.
3. The second sighting occurred at 1900 hours when seven round, luminous objects were reported to be maneuvering over Naha Air Base. Lt Phillip K. S. Platt, 18th Tactical Fighter Wing, described the objects as being about 8-10 feet in diameter, light in color, and very bright. The objects were reported to descend slowly from an altitude of 40,000 feet to about 10,000 feet, then accelerate and disappear. Lt Platt estimated the speed of the objects to be 600-700 mph. 
4. The final evaluation indicates that the first sighting was probably the re-entry of a space object and the second sighting was most likely a meteor or a meteor-like phenomenon.

Summary of 
Investigation of UFO Report, Naha Air Force Base, Okinawa

1. Naha Air Force Base, Okinawa, informed the 6313th Air Base Group, Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, of an unidentified flying object sighted in the area of Naha Air Force Base at 2115 hours local time on 8 October 1962.

2. Captain XXXXXX, USAF, was on duty in the control tower at the time the unidentified flying object was reported. He stated that at 2115 hours local time the control tower received a call from a civilian employee who reported seeing an unidentified flying object approximately 10 miles southwest of Naha Air Force Base. The object was described as being round in shape and white or light silver in color. The object was observed by the civilian employee for approximately 30 seconds before it accelerated and climbed out of sight.

3. Captain XXXXXX immediately went outside the control tower where he was able to observe the object for approximately 20 seconds before it climbed out of sight. Captain XXXXXX stated that the object appeared to be round in shape and silver or light gray in color. He further stated that the object accelerated very rapidly as it climbed out of sight.

4. No other witnesses to the sighting have been located. Extensive search of the area has been made, but no physical evidence of the object has been found.

5. The sighting has been reported to the 6313th Air Base Group, Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, and will be further investigated.

The extracted text from the document is:

The report states that the observation involved a large, fast moving, luminous rectangular object which was sighted over Naha Air Force Base, Okinawa on 10 October 1962. The object was observed by several military personnel. The report indicates that the object was tracked on radar and was estimated to be at an altitude of 20,000 feet and traveling at a speed of 1,000 knots. The report also mentions that the object exhibited erratic flight characteristics, making several abrupt turns and changes in velocity. No further information or analysis is provided in the text.

The image contains a photograph, but it does not depict any human faces that I can identify. The photograph shows a man walking along a dirt path or road through a rural, forested landscape. The path appears to wind through the trees, and there is a dark silhouette in the distance that may be a building or other structure. The image has a dark, grainy quality, suggesting it is an older photograph.
