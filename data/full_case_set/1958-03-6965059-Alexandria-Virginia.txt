"Dear Sir:

at about 11:30 P.M. this evening a strange obect apparently came. I realized it at strange myseft--an object passing which I could not identify immediately, as it was some distance from me. 

The first clear view was as it approached on the horizon. It seemed to be at an altitude of between "25,000" and "50,000" feet. As it passed directly overhead just east of the home where I was standing, I observed it closely and could see no wings or propeller. The object had an apparent diameter of 40 or 50 feet and seemed to be lit up internally. It made no noise and traveled at tremendous speed (possibly some 1,500 miles per hour) passing between the second and third star in the handle of the dipper from the first to the last in the space of about 6 seconds.

I step forward to observe more closely, but as it drew near the house and seemed to be heading toward the city of Alexandria, I decided it would be unwise to continue watching and returned to the house.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]"

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a routing slip. The text on the routing slip provides some information about a suggested reply to a letter from the general public, a note of thanks for reporting, a check of extra satellite orbital tracks, and an indication that the object has not been conclusively identified as yet or probably was a meteor. It also mentions that the reports will be used as part of the continuous study and investigation of aerial phenomena.

SUGGESTED REPLY TO LETTER FROM GENERAL PUBLIC.
a. NOTE OF THANKS FOR REPORTING.  
b. A CHECK OF EXTRA SATELLITE ORBITAL TRACKS INDICATES OBJECT SEEN WAS NOT SPUTNIK.
c. ALTHOUGH THE OBJECT HAS NOT BEEN CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFIED AS YET, WE ARE OF THE OPINION THAT IT PROBABLY WAS A METEOR.
THE REPORTS WILL BE USED AS PART OF OUR CONTINUOUS STUDY AND INVESTIGATION OF AERIAL PHENOMENA.

The provided image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a document from the Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects. 

The text in the document is as follows:

14 April 1958

Dear Mr. XXXXX,

Thank you for your letter of 23 March 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object.

A check of earth satellite orbital tracks indicate the object was not a satellite. Although the object has not been conclusively identified, a tentative analysis indicates that it probably was a meteor.

Your report will be used as a part of our continuous study and investigation of aerial phenomena.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
