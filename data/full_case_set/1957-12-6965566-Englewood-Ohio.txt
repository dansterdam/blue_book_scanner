Dear Colonel Mitchell:

On 30 November 1957 we received a call from Mr._____, operating for Los Angeles
212; California, reporting he had sighted several "unidentified flying objects" over his
residence at Englewood, California. He claimed these objects were brilliantly lighted and
maneuvered at high speeds. He was not able to cooperate with the Air Force in any way,
as he was not equipped to obtain photographs or films of the sighting.

As established a time for pickup, designated 43/c to arrive to residence and transport the film to be developed. There are no local Air Force facilities for handling and coloring we
could use under the current regulations. Since there are no local Air Force facilities for
photography, I picked up the film. The film had no extra processing or marking of any kind
other than the handling at the time of the filling of the object.

For your information: Attached you will find a copy of the report prepared by this office
by the children who observed the strange objects. Mr. _____ children had discussed the
sightings in detail with local Air Force and discussed ??

January 30, 1958

Captain Schaller
Regional Branch
Hollywood, California

Dear Captain Schaller:

Here is the report you requested in our last telephone conversation.

On Sunday, Dec. 1, 1957 at approximately 3 P.M., my wife and I were in our home in Miamisburg, Ohio when our eight year old boy and a three came in the house very excited and told us they had seen something unusual in the sky. This caused them to run in the house, frightened, and they told us that the sky contained a very large "object" that appeared to be circular in shape and of a brilliant white color. They claimed that this "object" had been hovering in the sky for several minutes.

We immediately went outside to investigate and were able to see the object very clearly. It was an oval shaped formation, moving rather slowly in a westerly direction just slightly north of our position. It held a constant speed and direction until it disappeared over the horizon. 

As soon as the objects disappeared, I phoned the E.L.A. Sheriff's Dept. They advised me to phone several other numbers which proved to be a waste of time - no further answer on Sunday.

At this point the kids came running in the house again, very excited, claiming they had seen the formation again. It was too late for any further observations.

After the excitement had died down, I separated the kids and had each of them draw a diagram of the formations, numbering the passes 1, 2, and 3. I saw only the second pass.

Why a note marked (illegible).

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text:

and am forced to rely on the children's description of the first and third formation patterns. I'm sure the following is correct:

1. A rather tight three-quarter circle.
2. Grouped in two's and arranged in a slightly elongated formation.
3. A straight formation.

Having no success at my first attempt on the phone, I decided to phone the operator. Taking the risk of her thinking me a lunatic, I explained the whole story, and she said she would refer me to Captain Scnaller. He was very courteous and seemed interested to eliminate any possibility of fraud. I told him that I would rather let the Air Force develop the film. A couple interested later an enlisted man stopped by the sketches and the undeveloped film.

About three weeks later I again talked to Captain Scnaller, and he seemed well pleased and even a little excited, and he said the films were "excellent" and the best UFOs he had seen. He added that a rather well-known officer by the name of Colonel Henry Hess had called the next morning and complimented him on the films. He said the films were the first UFOs that he had seen, including the films used by the movve industry. He told me the standard film was in good condition, and he assumed that I would want the films returned to Tarkio College where they were kept. I sent to Wright-Patterson AFB where they have such facilities, and make copies of the film". He stated that the incident was the best documented case of UFOs that he had phoned their library and upon receiving the film, especially when they discovered that the person that sent the films back to Wright-Patterson AFB were the same films he had asked me to send. He said I would also receive a 16mm copy.

I have told my story to various friends. When some of them doubted my story, Captain Scnaller was asked to verify it, and he stated in the mail a copy of the report Captain Scnaller had sent to a Colonel John F. McPhillips, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.

One shocking note was pointed out to me by a civilian investigator. Civi1ian orders titled [JANAP 146] and official instructions to personnel of the CAA based on JANAP 146. That JANAP 146 order applies to civilian airline pilots who report UFOs officially. Communications system known as CIVILS--Communications instructions for reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings! Why all this secrecy upon are complaints phenomenon?

Text from the document:

It is my understanding that it is AF policy to vigorously investigate all "good" UFO reports. Almost the only person who has bothered to investigate me was a flying saucer chaser.

It is also my understanding that it is AF policy to send a "standard questionnaire" to all people making a "good" report. Where's the 9" if they wait much longer, the report will probably be classified and filed as "doubtful value".

In conclusion, I would like to point out that many civilian and military pilots, radar operators, astronomers and ordinary citizens like myself have made these reports, explaining them away as weather conditions, meteors, mirage, mock suns, planets, etc. I do not think that this stock answer explaining them away as weather conditions is sufficient. It is certainly insufficient to explain the insistent and accurate descriptions given by many competent observers who have traversed the sky THREE TIMES, from horizon to horizon, maintaining a different formation pattern with each pass. This sighting is dramatic evidence supporting the argument held by many competent observers that there is intelligent control behind these observations.

Hoping this report to be of value...

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
Los Angeles, 22

The handwritten note at the bottom says: "This is referring to this man's reported (censored) UFO observation with parameters on his sketch."

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a report of an interview with Mr. [Redacted] on 31 January 1958. The report describes the details of a 8mm film that Mr. and Mrs. [Redacted] had taken, including the camera and lens used, the film type, and the shooting characteristics. The report then details the questions asked by the interviewer and the responses provided by Mr. [Redacted] regarding the observed objects and their altitude, as well as the absence of any visible smoke trails or vapor trails.

Report of Interview with Mr. [Redacted]
4 February 1958
On 31 January 1958 Mr. and Mrs. [Redacted] called at my home to pick up the 8mm film which they had loaned this office. We had finished duplication of the film at a local color film lab and the original 8mm film was returned to Mr. Benn.
I examined his camera, an 8mm Keystone Capri I-28 1 3/4" f3.5 telephoto lens Tiffen Photar 85 series 21.5mm. 
The film used was Kodachrome Indoor Type 4 shot outdoors with a type-A filter. The distance focusing was on infinity and shot at 16 frames per second.
I asked Mr. [Redacted] the following questions:
Q. What is your estimate of the altitude of the objects which you photographed?
A. About the same height as the light airplanes which frequently fly over the house, between 3000 and 4000 feet.
Q. Were they at any time as high as jet aircraft which make vapor trails?
A. No, definitely not.
Q. Did you see any smoke trail or any kind of trail from the objects?
A. No, there was no visible trail of any sort.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a project blue book document that contains only text.

9- What was the direction of flight?
A. The first pass sighted by the children came from the West and went in an easterly direction.
Q. Were they in any sort of formation?
A. Yes, a very close or tight formation in a 3/4 circular formation.
Q. At what speed, compared to a light plane passing over?
A. About the same speed, maybe a little slower.
Q. What direction was the second pass?
A. They came from the East heading West in an enlarged formation, split into pairs, with the point of the V formation to the right side of the formation.
Q. What was the speed of this pass?
A. About the same as the first pass, slightly slower than a light airplane.
Q. What about the third pass?
A. This pass was not photographed, but the boy said they went over in a straight-line formation, opposite the viewers position at a very fast speed, at about the same altitude.
Q. What were the size of the objects?
A. That's hard to say.

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document and does not contain any photographs. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

Q. Would you say they were as big in circumference as a circle inclosing the wing tips and tail to nose section of a light airplane? 
A. Yes, about that size.
Q. Were they all the same size?
A. Yes.
Q. What shape?
A. They were circular, and relatively flat.
Q. What color?
A. Sort of white-to-blue-green glowing objects.
Q. What do you think they were?
A. I don't know, but they were certainly not balloons or airplanes like any I had seen before.

OCR TEXT OUTPUT:
NEAR MISS AIR FORCE MISSING UFO MOVIE FRAMES
AS a result of recent television sightings, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director of the University of Arizona's Institute of Astronomy, has announced that the University of Arizona will investigate UFO reports. "More than 20 sightings have been reported to Dr. Hynek, and he believes the University will conduct the investigation."
NICAP has asked for the release of Air Force film on UFO sightings. In a letter dated 20-2, NICAP has asked for the release of earlier film on UFO sightings. The Air Force has not as yet released these films. Earlier were Air Force spokesamen that now claim more than 20 films to be examined, "unaware" that the films were in their possession.
NICAP was told earlier that no films on UFO's were in Air Force possession.
In a letter from the Air Force to Captain Schaller, Carswell AFB, the film was the best he had ever seen. This acknowledgement from the Air Force seems to confirm the existance of UFO films, which they have denied having in their possession. 
The facts are as follows:
On December 6, 1957, at about 3 p.m. an unidentified flying object was sighted near Englewood, Ohio. The object, about the size and a half of the full moon, was observed for 10 to 15 minutes. It appeared to have a double elliptical shell and emitted a bluish-green glow. NICAP members interviewed eyewitnesses, whose descriptions were consistent.
NICAP again points out that increased publicity, even for near-miss cases, can prevent immediate publication of most reports. Some reports cannot be investigated for months. They have turned in to NICAP individuals reporting UFO evidence for examination. NICAP will welcome membership applications from interested persons. NICAP has written a letter requesting exemption from CICA on grounds that their activities are for the public good.
NO NICAP AGENTS
Complaints reaching NICAP indicate that some people are falsely claiming to be NICAP representatives or members when soliciting their own copies of NICAP publications. NICAP has no agents selling its material. All NICAP representatives act in a volunteer capacity. No individuals or groups have been authorized by NICAP to make solicitations. This of course does not apply to the legitimate promotion of NICAP by authorized representatives.
THANKS to the many members sending clippings of UFO sightings to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. This assistance is appreciated, and helps to provide the latest information on UFO activity.
MEMBER IDEAS ON PROMOTION
NICAP welcomes suggestions for improving the Bulletin and introducing new membership services. NICAP is anxious to obtain suggestions for contacting individuals and organizations potentially interested in the UFO problem. All ideas on this score will receive prompt attention.

This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is a cover sheet for a case file titled "Pertinent Points in Rebuttal to Charges 'AFOIN* Clipped by Air Force". The text in the document discusses various details related to the case, including references to a letter addressed to an office, the film submitted through SAFIS, and the length of the film.

Reference is made to a letter addressed to your office from the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, Washington, D.C., dated 1 July 1958. The document also mentions that the film submitted to ATIC through SAFIS was Kodak 35mm film of standard 25 feet length, and that the film in the custody is exactly 25 feet in length. Examination reveals no cuts, splices, or alterations to the film.

3. Therefore, legally:

a. If we have exact copy of the film as given to Colonel Hess, reproduced there in his Griffiths photo labs and "our" copy shows no splices, cuts, etc. - then if he or others must have made the cuts - after it was returned back from the Air Force.

b. Mr. should be asked to show the alleged "clipped strips"

c. A copy of our copy could be made for retention to show him the "UFO strips" in detail, if we still wish to do whatever he wishes, advertise it, sell it, show to the public, or ".

d. Have Colonel Hess invite him down and ask him to lay out his film diagngstic so the Air Force copy and compare them. With Colonel Hess requesting a statement in writing that the "UFO strip" is still intact.

e. The 67th ARIC examined under instructions by both Major Buckmaster, Chief Photographic Branch, ATIC and Captain Gregory on 23 December 1957. The film or script or report was not UFO report or date with film other than that it was taken near Montebello, California on 1 December 1957. All concerned that the object which were visible "there."

f. Attached are thermofax copies of a balloon cluster being launched by a Western University having an Air Force contract. Mr. and have this with the alleged UFO on the film strip.

g. In the opinion of this Center this is another of the many charges made by their way apparently do not know (and actually only a few know. or are told) that the Air Force (now) makes a duplicate of all photos and movies.

This was a report. However, follow up was negative, as man was overly enthusiastic, stated siting was only of casual interest, - no evidence indication any true sighting.

He was located through his license and was reasonably normal, but his siting seemed to be overly dramatic and obviously a serious in depth of interest. It was recommended that no further action be taken.

The case was duly handled, and - ment is partially human that type of reaction still frequently occurs.

COMMENTS:
ALLEGED UFO
Montebello, Calif
1 December 1957

1. Looks like two pairs of balloons.
2. Move in unison - keep same distance.
3. Film too short and slightly out-of-focus and over-exposed.
4. Because of three (3) above, with very limited data (no exact azimuths, bearings, directions, elevations, etc.) very difficult to make a sound.
5. Review of letter, with the "chips on his shoulder" attitude, plus the obvious attempt to make a "big project" out of 5 seconds of film - strongly suggest that he knew what the objects were. Can't prove it though.
6. Enlarged to motion-picture screen size: Reviewed by Lt. Col Whither, Sgt. Bolieu, and Capt. Gregory in UFO Project Room.

The spokesman said the Air Force, in checking the Engleeither warned nor requested the arrest of any persons. The wood, Ohio, report, found no evidence of any conspiracy or "organized operation." 
The balloon sas seen between 9 and 10 o'clock Friday night in the Englewood area, the report said. The witness - who gave his name - reported seeing the balloons floating toward the southwest.
The report also stated that "no unusual markings or objects" were observed on the balloons. The Air Force expressed the opinion that the balloons were ordinary weather observation types, not "satellites" or "guided missiles" as the witness had suggested.

THEY KEEP THE SAME DISTANCE AND POSITION TO EACH OTHER ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE GROUP APPEARS TO MOVE TOWARDS AND FORTH. AND HAVE ALL THE APPEARANCES OF BEING BALLOONS OF SOME TYPE OF RIGID FRAMEWORK.

MORE FIRM CONCLUSIONS COULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED IF A REPORT ON THE BACKGROUND, FACTUAL DATA AND INFORMATION, AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SUBMITTED TOGETHER WITH THE FILM PER AFR 200-2.

WILL CONTACT MR WAGNER, SAFIS, AT HQ USAF AND NOTIFY YOU OF RESULTS.

SUBJECT: (U) Request for Review and Comment - UFO Motion Picture Film
TO: AFOTN-3-32E
FROM: AFOTN-IAAF

1. Film referred to in Comment 1 has been reviewed and the following facts have been ascertained:

a. Objects in question appear to be real and it is believed they are four balloons attached to each other.
b. Objects are at a great distance from photographer and the distance became greater as objects were photographed.
c. The objects appear to be floating and retain throughout the film, basic relationships to each other and appear to rotate in the relationships clock-wise.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a DISPOSITION FORM document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text from the document:

DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO.	SUBJECT	
	(U) Request for Review and Comment--UFO Motion
TO	FROM	DATE	COMMENT NO. 1
ATTN: Maj. Buckmaster	ASTIA-LRSE-1	29 Dec 1957	4741/Capt. Gregory/dn
	69216
1. Reference conversation between Maj. Buckmaster and Capt. Gregory, Saturday night, 21 December 1957, regarding a UFO film that Gen. Watson was informed would be submitted to this office for immediate review and comment.
2. Request study of subject film, with detailed comments as to the nature of the objects purported to be UFO's. The detailed report attendant to this case has not arrived as yet, but a brief IT message regarding the general circumstances surrounding the matter is attached.
3. The fact that the film was submitted directly to the PIO office in Hollywood rather than directly to USAF or ATIC is considered significant. Reference our recent discussions concerning the soon-to-be-released report (SC XRCO) that apparently 65% of UFO cases submitted are from Southern California.
4. Lt. USAF has telephonically requested that it be notified immediately of our findings with regard to this film.
