DETAILS

1. This investigation is predicated upon a letter dated 27 November
1949 to District Office No. 13, OSI, from the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion, Los Angeles. The pertinent part of this letter is quoted below:

"On November 24, 1949, ******/
phonically advised this office that on the previous afternoon he had
been playing golf at the Lakeside Country Club ******/ 
overheard ******/ talking about a ******/ radio the latter had in his
possession and which he claimed had come from a flying disc which had
crashed in New Mexico. ******/ radio in its all burnished
had been found with him at the golf course ******/ described the radio
as being about 7x7x2 inches.

Further advised ******/ he had an unnamed scientist
was using the radio as a 'tool-sample,' to find out operation and the
ground. ******/ stated that several of the flying discs had recently
crashed in New Mexico, Arizona and islain. He also stated that the
discs had contained men and that he had bits of cloth taken from the
clothing of these men. In addition, ******/ claimed to have pieces of
metal from the gears of the disc.

" ******/ gave his address as 1360 South Beverly Glen, telephone
Crestview 56078. He explained that he had never known until that
golfing engagement and further pointed out that ******/ a supper at the
time the above allegations were made."

2. Efforts were made to establish the identity of ******/ and a re-
view of the Los Angeles Telephone Directories and City Directory was made.
The Northeastern Section of the telephone directory indicated that a 
******/ might be identical with ******/ resided 
******/, California, talipho-
to this number ******/ later definitively identified. A call placed
since the party who answered the phone stated he was in the oil well
business as per above quoted letter and that he could be reached at Wilson 
******/

Oil Company, Hannond, California. The operator at this directory
spent most of his idle time in the Gold Room and that he would have him call 
OSI. Eventually ******/ mentioned ******/ called and he was eliminated as being
identical with ******/ mentioned above.

3. ******/ request was ******/ idea of the Lakeside Golf man,
Hollywood, California, to have ******/ communicate with agent at OSI. 
******/ had subsequently in its
was made with the telephone operator and she was requested to have ******/ 
call us. The golf club's chairman of the program stated that ******/ was a 
member but refused to give ******/ his residence address.

Attempts were also made to ******/ in order to solicit his aid in ******/

address but agent was advised that he has been out of the country on vacation
for the past several months.

5. Through the cooperation of ---------- residents, when
Hermosa Beach, California, it was determined that ---------- resided
in the Los Angeles area, at the HOLLYWOOD-KNICKERBOCKER HOTEL, 1714 Ivar
Avenue, Hollywood, California. Several attempts were made to communicate
with ---------- there but he was always out and he never responded to a note
left at the hotel desk.

6. On one of these occasions DOUGLAS HATHISON, assistant manager,
HOLLYWOOD-KNICKERBOCKER HOTEL, showed a letter postmarked Lamarado,
Wyoming, 17 February 1950, in which ---------- stated that he was "still marooned
in Yap" and that he would "see you soon." The letter was written on the
stationary and with Camp, WY, Equitable buildings, Dairyer, Colorado. A
subsequent interview with MR---------- disclosed that ---------- apparently
received agent's note but to date he has not communicated with this office.

7. Because of should be obvious lack of cooperation it is felt that
no further efforts should be made to attempt to have him questioned in this
this office. It might be mentioned here that during the preliminary efforts
of this Office to lo. it was  ed by interviews
radio news commentator, SID HAYS, on a morning program, announced in effect
that a party at a Hollywood country club had stated that he had information
on flying discs and that the discussion took place over a round of drinks at
the "nineteenth hole" of the local golf course and that the "story got better
with each drink." This news broadcast obviously was meant to ridicule the
course of the story and may account for ---------- failure to call OSI as
per numerous messages requesting him to do so.
