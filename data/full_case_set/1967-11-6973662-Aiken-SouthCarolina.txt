ROBERT LOUIS AIKEN
AIKEN, SOUTH CAROLINA

6 NOVEMBER 1967

At approximately 10:15 PM on 6 November 1967, I was outside my home in the Willow Run subdivision, Aiken, South Carolina, observing the night sky. The sky was clear and the stars were visible. Suddenly, I observed a bright, round object which appeared to be hovering or moving slowly in a southwesterly direction at a high altitude. The object was observed for approximately 10-15 seconds before going out of my field of vision.

The object was round in shape and appeared to be several times larger than a star. It gave off a bright, steady white light. I am unable to estimate the altitude or distance of the object with any degree of accuracy.
