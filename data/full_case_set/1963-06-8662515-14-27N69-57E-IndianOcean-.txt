Dear Colonel Carey:

This is to advise you of a sighting of an unidentified flying object which occurred in the Indian Ocean on June 8, 1963 at approximately 2:15 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. The object was sighted from a U.S. Navy aircraft while on a routine flight from NAAS Oceans, Guam to NAS Argentia, Newfoundland.

The object was first sighted at an altitude of approximately 5000 feet and was initially described as being similar in appearance to a large high-altitude weather balloon. However, as the aircraft closed in on the object, it was observed to be a distinct metallic-appearing disk which was estimated to be approximately 50-60 feet in diameter. The disk was hovering stationary and was apparently rotating on a vertical axis. As the aircraft closed to within approximately 1 mile, the disk suddenly accelerated at a terrific rate of speed and disappeared from sight within 2-3 seconds. No vapor trails or exhaust were observed and no sound was heard from the object.

The crew members, consisting of the pilot, co-pilot, and navigator, were all able to clearly observe the object. They all stated that it was not an aircraft or any known type of aerial vehicle. The pilot indicated that the object did not in any way resemble a weather balloon or any other known aerial object. No identification or registration markings were visible on the disk.

I trust this information will be of value to you in your investigation of unidentified flying objects. If any additional details are required, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Very truly yours,
