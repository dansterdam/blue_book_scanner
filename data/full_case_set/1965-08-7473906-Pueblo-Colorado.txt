There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report detailing an incident where multiple artillery flares were observed in the sky near Fort Carson, Colorado on August 13, 1965. The document provides details about the observation and the response from Air Force personnel, including the analysis that the sighting was likely an "optical illusion" rather than a physical object.

AN OPTICAL ILLUSION. CONTACT WITH NORAD COC, SPADATS,

GENERAL DIRECTION: THIS ELIMINATES POSSIBILITY OF OBJECTS
COMING FROM THAT SOURCE. WIND ATA NOT AVAILABLE FROM
PUEBLO HOWEVER PATTERN IN GENERAL SHOULD AGREE WITH
THAT OF COLORADO SPRINGS. THE WINDS AT COLORADO SPRINGS
PAGE 3 RUNMFVA@299 UNCLAS
DO NOT SHIFT AROUND TO A DIRECTION THAT WOULD CAUSE A
PIBAI TO DEIFT SOUTHWEST UNTIL 20,000 FEET. HOWEVER THIS
DOES NOT CORRELATE WITH POSITION AND ESTIMATED ALTITUDE
AND SPEED OF REPORTED OBJECT. COLORADO SPRINGS GENERAL
AREA HAS EXPERIENCED SEVERAL VERY CLEAR NIGHTS RECENTLY
DURING WHICH STARS WERE UNUSUALLY BRIGHT. IT IS POSSIBLE
OBJECT SIGHTED WAS A STAR, AS DIRECTION AND RATE OF
MOVEMENT WOULD SUBSTANTIATE THIS. HOWEVER INFORMATION
AVAILABLE TOO MEAGER TO ARRIVE AT A FIRM CONCLUSION.
