15 August 1952

A/2c 24665 2570 hours, on the evening of 14 August 1952, I and a friend observed a light that seemed to be moving in the sky. The light was quite bright and seemed to us to be much larger than a star. We watched it for approximately 10 minutes and it seemed to move about in the sky. It would move up, down, and sideways in a jerky motion. At times it seemed to hover and then move rapidly across the sky. To the best of my recollection, it was observed in a northwest direction from my position. The light seemed to have a halo or glow around it. After calling to someone else to observe it, it suddenly disappeared from sight. I reported the incident to the duty officer and was instructed to report it to the intelligence officer the following day.

At the time of the sighting the sky was clear and the object could easily be seen. It did not seem to be a star, planet, or an aircraft. I had the (1) scope of less at approximately 1530.

The text in the document is as follows:

15 August 1952

On the night of 14 August 1952 shortly before 2200 hours the following incident took place at Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan. A pilot on duty on the flight line saw a strange object hovering over the field. He called the control tower and they also observed the object. The object then proceeded toward the northwest and disappeared from view. The control tower then notified the office of special investigations (OSI) and the on duty officer Lt. -----. Lt. ----- in turn notified the radar station who picked up the object on radar. The radar personnel reported that the object moved at an extremely high rate of speed, making almost instantaneous 90 degree turns. The object was under positive radar contact for approximately 20 minutes before it disappeared from the scope.

The weather was clear and the object was observed both visually and on radar. The object was described as a white or luminous sphere, hovering and making extremely rapid maneuvers. It was much larger than any known type of aircraft. The pilot and control tower personnel estimate that the object was approximately 3 to 5 miles distant from the field and at an altitude of between 3,000 to 5,000 feet. It was under observation for a total period of approximately 30 minutes. No sound was heard and no exhaust or trail was observed. 

The persons observing the object are considered reliable and their reports are considered to be accurate. This incident has been reported to higher headquarters.

15 August 1952

At 2235 hours, 15 August 1952, I had just finished work and was on my way to barracks when I was called to observe a large object hovering over the lake.

They were standing, looking towards the lake, between buildings 47 and 48. The object hovered, oscillating in a strange manner, and blinked on and off. It seemed to move or bounce around a little and would become very bright at times, then dim, but it did not appear to leave the general area. The color was a strange color, not like any aircraft I have ever seen. It was round and seemed to be about the size of a car at arm's length. About half the size of the full moon. It appeared to be self-luminous and did not reflect light as we know it. There seemed to be a glow around the edges.

After a slight pause, it seemed to go into a clear spot and just seemed to vanish. It came so complete a stop and just seemed to turn off, among the stars.

At the time, or just before, the two (2) airmen who called me advised that the object first appeared in a northwest-northeast direction and seemed to hover for a short time, then it disappeared, to about the same area, shortly after the arrival of the duty officer, the object did not reappear.

This object traveled from a twelve o'clock position (where I first observed it) to a thirty o'clock position and then seemed to disappear into clear space. The weather was clear and I feel sure that the visual acuity of the officer and myself was not impaired. This was not like anything I have ever seen before and defies any logical explanation.

This statement is true and as I had just finished work, the object was observed soon after as stated above. I was amazed at what I saw and I suspect that this case is one of those definite that is was traveling at a greater speed than our fastest aircraft can go.

HEADQUARTERS OF INTELLIGENCE
HQ. USAF

1. At 2335 GMT AUGUST 3, 1952 a REPORT was called in to the Detroit Control Center, Michigan by the Selfridge Air Force Base that a RADAR CONTACT had been made on the AZUR FLY-H2 g-22. This CONTACT was observed and identified as a F-94 JET AIRCRAFT piloted by 1st LT M. G. DIAZ and LT G. W. STRONG. Both pilots aboard the F-94 were able to clearly observe a large BRIGHT LIGHT AND AIR SPEED GREATLY EXCEEDING THEIR SPEEDS AS MEASURED ON THE COCKPIT INSTRUMENTS. THE AIR SPEED OF THIS LIGHT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE IN EXCESS OF 1500 KNOTS. THE OBJECT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO VISUALLY TRACK AND APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING AT A VERY HIGH ALTITUDE.

2. BOTH OBSERVERS CONTINUED TO WATCH THE OBJECT AND IT APPEARED TO STOP IN MID-FLIGHT AND THEN TRAVEL IN A STRAIGHT AND LEVEL PATH DIRECTLY TOWARDS THEIR AIRCRAFT. (1) IT APPEARED TO BE A BRILLIANT LIGHT, GREATER THAN THE LANDING LIGHTS OF THEIR AIRCRAFT. (2) THE OBJECT CHANGED COURSE ABRUPTLY AND ACCELERATED RAPIDLY OUT OF SIGHT. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT TRAVELED BEYOND THE HORIZON IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.

3. AIRMAN X ALSO REPORTED HIS OBSERVATIONS TO THE CONTROL CENTER WHEN REPORTED THEIR OBSERVATIONS. THIS LIGHT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN (10) MINUTES. ALL PERSONS WHO OBSERVED THE OBJECT STATED POSITIVELY THAT THEY HAD NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING SIMILAR IN THEIR EXPERIENCE.

.  4.  According to the Glat 735-7-C:1220 the estimated AVERAGE SPEED of this object was: 14700 mph.
5.  1. A close examination by this investigator revealed that the object passed a certain point at 14,700 mph. The estimated time of sight was 4-5 seconds.
