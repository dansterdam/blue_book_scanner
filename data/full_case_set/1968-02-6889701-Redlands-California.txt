SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report (UFO)

TO: FTD
Wright Patterson AFB Ohio

1. Sunday, 4 Feb 68, at approximately 1930 PST the Norton AFB Dispatch
Station of Base Operations received a phone call concerning a UFO.
The woman's description was very incoherent. Furthermore she would
not supply her address or telephone number. Due to the nature of the
telephone conversation the dispatcher could only ignore the incident
and the two officers who was notified.

2. The first indication of a UFO sighting received by this activity
was from a Mr John Ahrens of the University of Colorado. Mr Ahrens
called on Friday, 9 Feb, and asked if an investigation had been
initiated by our activity. I told him that we were unaware of the
sighting. Mr Ahrens a professor at the University of Colorado,
said the University of Redlands, Redlands, California, Dr Seff works
in the Unmanned Spacecraft System employed by the University of Colorado. I immediately contacted Dr Seff and was informed
that the had implicated an investigation action by Dr Krauss and Dr Sanderson
also of the University of Redlands. They had interviewed the children
(2 girls and a boy) of the same family and a Mr Caff. All the witnesses
stated the same general form and findings. Their investigation was concluded by the following:

4. The UFO sighting was not caused by a conventional aircraft.
They did not rule out the possibility of a helicopter. If there had been one
in the area.

5. The loud whirring sound associated with the UFO was similar to
the sound used on the TV show the "Invaders". The sound caused many dogs
in the area to bark.

6. Mr Caff, a witness, disclosed that he had a tingling
sensation during the sighting that caused the hair on his body to stand
on end. Dr Seff suggested that this description implied the presence of
some sort of electromagnetic force.

Dr Seff is now attempting to contact additional witnesses. The results
of his investigation will be forwarded to the University of Colorado.

3. After discussing the entire UFO sighting with Dr. Staff I conducted a belated investigation.
4. The following UFO report is submitted in accordance with AFR 80-17. The attached UFO worksheet includes all information required by the above regulation.
5. Statements reviewed by at the Redlands Police Department. All questions asked were answered on the attached UFO worksheet. It should be noted at this time that the answers are very similar to the answers given to Dr. Staff and his associates when the same witness was interviewed by them. In addition, two articles that appeared in the local Redlands newspaper are attached.
6. Comments of the investigating officer are:
a. From all the information gathered, it would be most likely to assume that the sound heard by Dr. Staff and the dogs to bark was the mechanical noise produced by a high powered crane described in the newspaper article, dated 7 Feb 68. The team moved through the area approximately four to five blocks to the location of the sighting. In this same direction described by him, and at the identical time of the sighting.
b. As mentioned at the time of the new article dated 7 Feb 68, the indication is made that the mystery of the strange sound, seems to be satisfied by the proximity of the search and rescue team. The investigation disclosed that a light plane arrived at Redlands Airport on 10 Feb 68. The traffic patterns for light planes could cause a flight path similar to the light directions described by the witness. No unusual targets on radar during the immediate area during this period.
Based on the facts presented, the probability exists that the flight path of the light plane accompanied by the search and rescue siren caused this UFO report.

The text on the page appears to be a form or questionnaire used to gather information about a reported UFO sighting. The form includes sections for recording the angle of elevation and azimuth (direction) of the observed object, the description of the flight path and/or maneuver of the object, the estimated distance to the object, the length of time the object was observed, and the use of various observational equipment. There are also sections for providing additional details about the sighting, such as the type of aircraft identification and the observer's actions.

Could it have been rescue team?
Now...what about that UFO?
was the sound a north Redlands man speculated was produced by a lighted object seen in the sky about 7:30 p.m. Sunday actually produced by a lighted object he saw later by Teitz.
Or was it merely the strange-sounding alarm of a search and rescue team that came to an auto accident in the mountainous area which allegedly was taken by some into the UFO rumor.
The siren theory was advanced, although he [Teitz] initially became convinced the object apparently "turned" over an area where a house broke up with the apparent reason for red lights partially outlining something that was specifically to be moved, turned west and came up the mountain again, Teitz said he continued to hear the sound as the lights moved to an area where they suddenly disappeared.
He said the lights definitely went right over his house. "I don't think it was an airplane," he said.
A number of other residents were also reported to have heard and saw the same persons apparently "turn" off their lights and disappear into the night.
At approximately the same time, the Sheriffs Department rescue team was attempting a rescue at the home of a family whose three occupants that plunged down an embankment. Deputy Sheriff's Sgt. Phil Pownders, a member of the rescue team, said that unconfirmed reports indicated they had received a high-pitched electronic squeal from the vehicle occupied by the family, raising the possibility an encounter with UFO phenomenon could have occurred.
The carryall turned north on Church St. near headquarters at 7:11 p.m. Sunday, according to Teitz, who said the sound seemed to come from a UFO that then hovered low over his home on Washington street, near the accident scene.
Investigators indicated the sound heard by Teitz and by other residents in the vicinity was considerably farther than the location of the rescue team, though the vehicle was coming right through the church, a matter fact, explained in that.
The sound heard by Teitz and by other residents in the area, there is still the matter of the moving red lights in the sky.
Although the rescue team car apparently equipped with a red light is sometimes required at scenes, according to Pownders, it would appear the red lights seen were considerably brighter than a normal tail light or rescue vehicle strobe. It has been reported that some UFO researchers believe red and green lights are sometimes seen associated with UFO incidents.
