ACTIVITY OF AERIAL PHENOMENA RESEARCH ORGANIZATION

1. Reference attached copy of a letter from the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization to Major Lawrence J. Tacker, dated 18 April 1960.

2. The Aerial Phenomena Research Organization has not been included in the selection of certain ATIC/UFOB Liaison Officers. It is hoped this can be remedied.

3. It should be noted that APRO is converting the meaning dated 11 September 1959, particularly paragraphs 5i and 5j, to our knowledge the information claimed by APRO has not been verified.

4. On 25 March 1960, at 18:25 (6:25 p.m.), a flying object was observed by several reliable witnesses and as described varied reports received by ATIC. The witnesses described the object as glowing, bluish-white in color, and moving at very high speed. The witnesses all agree the object was travelling in a generally east to west direction, and disappeared below the trees or mountain.

5. For your information this sighting was classified confidential under the category of "Unknowns" and retained in the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) files.

SIGHTING REPORT
7 MARCH 1960
1. On 7 March 1960, at approximately 2130 hours, the undersigned was
on duty in the airborne control and warning squadron (ACWS) control
room at Biggs A.F.B., Texas. At that time, radar contact was made on an
unidentified object at a range of approximately 100 miles and at an
altitude of 20,000 feet. The target displayed rapid speed and erratic
movement. Numerous attempts were made to establish communication
with the object by both voice and radar beacon, but no response was
received. The object remained unidentified.
2. The above information is true and correct to the best of my
knowledge and belief.

UFO SIGHTING, BICES AFB, 25 MARCH 1960

1. On 26 March 1960, three airmen on guard duty at Biggs AFB, Texas, spotted an object which was described as bright light approximately the size of a half-dollar coin held at arm's length. The object was approximately one thousand yards from their position and at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. The object was observed for approximately four seconds.

2. Analysis of all available information indicates that the sighting was probably a lenticular or partially obscured celestial body which was observed in the initial stages of becoming visible as a result of illumination from the rising sun. Witnesses to the incident stated that the object did not appear to leave a trail or exhibit any other extraordinary characteristics.

3. The following personnel assigned to the 25th Combat Defense Squadron witnessed the sighting:

Stout, John G., s/Sgt
Chase, Claude A./Sgt
Picken, Kenneth L., a/2c

4. For your information this sighting was classified confidentially. This is one of a number of sightings reported from this area recently which have been scrutinized. None of the reported details are considered classic or alarming, indicating only the normal problems associated with the identification of the many natural objects observed.

TRANSCRIPT:

PROJECT BLUE BOOK
REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

DATE OF OBSERVATION: 7 March 1960
TIME OF OBSERVATION: 0830 CST
LOCATION: Biggs AFB, Texas

NARRATIVE SUMMARY: At 0830 CST on 7 March 1960 an unidentified flying object was observed for approximately 5 minutes by Sgt. Kenneth L. McCool of the 95th Bomb Wing at Biggs AFB, Texas. Sgt. McCool stated that he was observing the area on routine patrol when he observed a bright metallic object in the eastern sky at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was hovering or stationary. After approximately 5 minutes, the object rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view. No sound was heard during the observation.

EVALUATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: After careful investigation, the object observed was determined to be the planet Venus, which was visible in the eastern sky during the time of observation.

"REPLY TO ATTN OF: SAGMAT

SUBJECT: Reference to message, R-11-4-70, 1 April 1960

TO: AFOSC, Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Reference your message (Uneclassified), R-11-4-70, 1 April 1960, concerning sighting observed by 55th Combat Logistics Squadron, 55th Tactical Fighter Wingat Biggs Air Force Base, Texas.

Stated that bright light, blue in color, appeared to be on runway-taxiway marker lights. The light was observed for approximately 5-7 seconds and then suddenly disappeared. Reported to have been observed by several observers, including the Shift Supervisor, Flight Chief, and Airman. The location was on the flight line at Biggs Air Force Base, Texas.

Research Associate from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Port Davis, Texas, indicates that this was probably one of the several artificial satellites orbiting the earth at the time, which were observed as point sources of light, sometimes referred to as "stars" by the observers.

1. Conclusions:
1. Bright light, blue in color, on runway-taxiway marker lights.
2. Blinks of alert."
