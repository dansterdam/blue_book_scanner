There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an "Air Intelligence Information Report" dated 24 March 1952 regarding a sighting of an unidentified object near Point Conception, California.

Text from the document:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Object
PLACE: Near Point Conception, California
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 24 March 1952
DATE OF INFORMATION: 24 March 1952
PREPARED BY: Lt John F. McGraw, Operational Intel.

The following is a statement submitted by Lt Hancock, Radar Observer, 102nd Bomb Squadron, on 25 March 1952:
While on a routine mission on 24 March 1952, I observed on the radar scope an object which was unidentified to me. The object appeared to be a clear and distinct radar return. The return first appeared on scope 20-30 seconds its speed was calculated at 3000 M.P.H. Based on electronic means, it seemed to be traveling at a constant velocity of 25,000 M.P.H. Our course was 270 degrees, our position at the time incident was 34 degrees 30 minutes North, 120 degrees 15 minutes West. The object was observed visually by the pilot and he stated that it appeared to be a rapidly moving light which was observed for approximately 1-2 minutes.
There are no deviations from normal weather conditions which could account for this radar anomaly. The visual description given by the pilot tends to corroborate the electronic data and the existence of a definite object either electronic or physical, i.e. a possible electronic manifestation of a rapidly moving unidentified object or actual physical sighting (which could give some trace indication on radar) is indicated.
