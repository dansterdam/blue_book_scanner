Apr. 25-El Monte, Calif.- R. M. Orose., of Covine,, described 
a half-priee-shaped object which emitted no sound and was "a bril-
liant white". The UFO, first observed at 8:30 p.m. "appeared to 
be hovering about 1,000 feet above" him. "It had no riding lights,"
he said, "and that fact dismissed my first thought that it was a 
plane," Mr. Cross added the object finally made an arc and headed
eastward. (El Monte Herald, 4/27)

No Case (Information Only)             29 April 1956
                                       Phoenix, Arizona

Apr. 29 - Phoenix, Ariz.- Bud Pease, with his family, were 
driving from Los Angeles to Greenwich, Conn. Here is his story:
"As we were starting out in the early morning on the highway to Tempi,  
Arizona (between Phoenix and Tucson), my father remarked about a 
object in the sky to the right front of us. When I first looked I 
saw a long silvery object with something seeming to shoot away from 
it and to the right of us. I immediately asked for the large pair 
of binoculars I knew my 5 year old son would be interested in. When 
I looked I didn't have them in focus right away but I could tell 
that this object was a long cigar shaped with a dark spot, or hole, 
in the center. I then handed the glasses to my father. After a 
while he said he saw what looked like a row of 'window or portholes 
that kept flashing light or flames along the side of the thing, and 
that while it was hovering, wobbling like a little before darting 
real swift to the bottom. About this same time I noticed that 
the thing seemed to flare up, after which it appeared to be far 
ther away.

"Along the side of the highway were telephone poles, two in 
a row. This is important because the object seemed to follow the 
poles without much coutching-'til, them, for a short sisi. Finally, 
after we were out of the traffic, we stopped along side of the 
road to get a better look at the object. By this time it had moved 
from the right to the left of the highway and away from the tele 
phone poles. It was new over some mountain in the distance and 
seemed to have gotten there rather quickly. I got one last good 
look at it through the binoculars before we got it cover and it 
looked like a big ball point pen bum moving on tom' and technr 
underneath. The sight, in all, lasted ten minutes." (Mr. Pease 
area estimates the object being about .75 degree--Ed.) (On file.)

No Case (Information Only)
30 April 1956 East Mansfield, Massachusetts

April 30, East Mansfield, Mass. - Mrs. Gilmore, 1776 East Street, described what appeared to be a bonfire in the sky at 8:15 p.m. She said, it came whistling down and plunged to the street, just a few feet from her house. A ball of fire, the size of a baseball. Then it toppled over and hit the road, in a burst of orange flame. The newspaper account added, “Small fragments burned on the ground. They were brought into the Gilmore home; but as they cooled, they faded away, disappeared without trace. In a few moments, there was nothing left...Only a strange burnt mark in grass on the roadside where the fire burned. (Mansfield News-Times, 5/7).

                                           Coffeyville, Kansas


 Apr. 2--Coffeyville, Kan.--Mr. H. Smith was awakened when his
 wife became alarmed over the increasing velocity of the wind short
 ly after 6 A.M. Said he: "I went outside to check the clouds and 
 to my astonishment saw this illuminated object gliding down toward 
 neighbor's house. There was no framework visible, but the lighted

 body appeared somewhat heavier than the standard airplane with a
 wingspread of about 30 feet. It hovered over the Joe Forbish res
 idence, then 500 feet south over our house, at which it began 300 feet.
 altitude, then glided across the road to Alboro in the Thompson sec
 zon house before starting toward our house. Mrs. Smith 
 saw the object reached our place, however, it veered off and
 started to ascend again. Just then, Mrs. Smith came out to see 
 what was keeping and saw it along the street. For a few minutes,
 it appeared to emit some sort of light from it and then disappeared
 into the clouds." (Coffeyville Daily Journal, 4/3.)

               BRILLIANT OBJECT STARTLES MONTANA RESIDENTS: Five peo-
ple living in the Brown's Gulch district of Montana reported that on the night 
of April 5th, at about 9:30 p.m., they saw an extremely bright object which 
seemed to be in the sky near their house. Mrs. Victoria Gabrielli, her son 
Victor Gabrielli, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Mitchell and Mrs. Mary Baxendale were
gathered in the Gabrielli residence watching television, with the house part-
ially darkened, they said, when the phenomenon occurred. "It lit up the whole 
house," Mrs. Gabrielli said. "The television blacked out at the same time. We
thought it was a crashing plane or some kind of explosion, but there was no 
noise. The television came on again in a few seconds." The Civil Aeronautics 
Administration offices at the local airport said no unusual objects in the sky 
had been logged or reported at its office that night, and that there were no 
plane crashes in the area.
