UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
 
TYPE OF VEHICLE 
UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT
 
UNUSUAL OBSERVATION 
The object appeared oval shaped, bright and silvery metallic in color. It flew with a rotational motion, tilting and turning without the usual noise or exhaust of conventional aircraft. It moved at a high rate of speed and disappeared after several minutes.
 
INITIAL IMPRESSION OF THE SEER 
The observer was impressed by the unusual size, speed and motion of the object, which did not resemble any known aircraft. The observer felt it was something out of the ordinary and believed it was some form of unidentified flying object.
 
OTHER SIGNIFICANT DETAILS 
The observer noted that the object seemed to have an unusual aura or glow around it. There was no sound or exhaust associated with the object. It moved in a rotational manner, tilting and turning as it flew, without the typical characteristics of a conventional aircraft.
 
DOES THIS SEEM RELATED TO WHAT YOU SAW? DESCRIBE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EVENT AND YOUR IMPRESSION.
The details in this report are consistent with the observer's description of an unusual aerial object that did not resemble any known aircraft. The characteristics mentioned, such as the rotational motion, lack of sound or exhaust, and high speed, suggest this was some form of unidentified flying object.

At one time it seemed to come directly toward me, then it would move away.
It was triangular in shape and appeared to have lights on the corners.
The lights appeared to alternately brighten and dim.
At times it appeared to be one solid light, then it would break up into three distinct lights.
After about 15 minutes the object moved off to the northwest and disappeared.
The sighting lasted for about 30 minutes.
The object made no sound.

Sept. 12, 1968

Dear Hector: 

Refer to your letter to receive the Cuming County, Nebraska, report of July 29, 1968. I'm sorry I cannot give you any more information from this report. 

I'm sure that you have developed a sort of 'case history' on the obvious hoaxes and in comparing the descriptives you should reports, while I doubt that I can add anything of value to these reports, I would like to make a few comments on the instant case. 

First, I written to Rogers for a few more details, including a sketch of the scene. 

I'm also sure that you have developed a sort of 'case history' on the obvious hoaxes and in comparing the descriptives you should reports, while I doubt that I can add anything of value to these reports, I would like to make a few comments on the instant case. 

Now, since Rogers does not seem to have "seen" it (the object, I presume), this case is necessarily based on testimonial accounts only. The witness, Mr. Woodyard, does not claim to have seen the object either. All he heard, according to the report, was a roaring noise and saw a bright light in the sky (which, of course, does not prove that the noise and the light were connected). 

I'm afraid that, since I did not have the opportunity to see the case in more detail, I cannot make any intelligent comments that would be of value to you. I did not find anything in the report that would lead me to believe that a real UFO was involved. The report, as you can see, is rather sketchy.

Yours sincerely,

It also mentions that the witness has included weather data for the sighting.

Now, here is the full text of the document as an OCR output:

Philip J. Klaus
307 30th Street SW
Washington, D.C. 20024

Dear Phil:

You may find the attached material an interesting addition to the Cuming County, Nebraska, sighting reports. I am still working on analyzing this data and attempting to resolve the uncertainties described in the original letter to me.

This is one of those cases marked by a strange, bright light seen crossing the sky for several seconds. The witness, William C. Jones, a 52-year-old farmer, is a thoroughly honest, reliable man whose report is consistent with physical evidence found at the site.

I do not have a good trajectory for the meteor, but I feel it is probably independent of sighting. Jones, and it is quite conceivable that is was just a coincidence that it passed over Cuming County, Nebraska, which isn't all that far from the meteor's path.

I have included part of my investigation on this matter. If you want to continue your analysis on this case, I'll be glad to receive your comments, suggestions, etc. However, I will not reveal names, contact details or addresses.

I've requested complete weather data for the Cuming County sighting, which I'll send as soon as I receive it.

Sincerely,

This document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed text, possibly a report or document from Project Blue Book, discussing various electromagnetic disturbances and phenomena observed during a fireball event.

Text from the document:

XV. ELECTROMAGNETIC DISTURBANCES DURING FIREBALL EVENTS

Astapovich calls the various electromagnetic phenomena observed during fireball passage "radioelectric" and "electromagnetic." (12) These electromagnetic disturbances, if a net result, accumulated in the wake of the fireball. The charged craft could possibly be the cause of the disturbances in the same way as a thunderstorm. They could disturb radio communications, blackout, and the earth's fire might be seen, and local radio reception could also be upset. It is also probable that motion of the plasma around the fireball through the earth's magnetic field could be the cause of some of the disturbances. Also, electromagnetic radiation could cause some disturbance in the magnetic field. Apparently, the disturbances were not limited to radio static. Astapovich reports a few instances which included disruption of electrical power during the fireball of November 29, 1962 (old calendar), near the village of Noviy Byt.* "Electrical power failed there, the earth was shaken in many places, and on the roads and dwellings there was burning paper, and people were afraid "fire around and near them" during the flight of a large fireball. Many instances of alleged malfunctions of machinery accompanying fireballs have been recorded, and there were cases in which the "size" behaved like ball lightning, becoming first large and then shrinking to radiological night as it disappeared. In the third, a careful recording of Astapovich's original data suggests that at least as many cases involved the temporary failure of power lines to electrical machinery, apparatus and devices as were associated with fireballs. According to eyewitnesses of the event, the electrical equipment cooled during the fireball passage. It is not known if this phenomenon of electromagnetic disturbances is consistent with the passage of a fireball.

Other electrical disturbances have been observed in recent years. According to eyewitnesses of the Mantra studies of February 1962, there were disturbances to radio communications and power failures.

This report was not corroborated by other observers. (14) Ware (15) gives another account of a farm two miles south of Cueing and Watch witnessed by a man who saw "apparently bright" football near Charleston. Such glows have appeared frequently during electrical storms in this region. 
On the signal reacted at the ageor weather parson from a Radiasund, the radiasund was located at an altitude of 10,000 ft. and the signal wand located in a high powered radio. A high-powered mount was located at a distance of 10,000 ft, and the signal was picked up intermittently as the object of observation.
Borne observations indicated that the electromagnetic wave associated with the electrical-line currents of 1,000 V reached a maximum amplitude when 12 mr of the 2340 mc wave received a strong signal from the direct at the antenna of which they were in contact.
Because the line was disconnected at the time the shock was fair, it is concluded that a strong burst of the initial radiation followed with a slow charge because the line capacitor charged to a high volt-age and then grounded due to arc breakdown. This type of analysis suggested that the above example, the general disturbances, and the power voltage current changes can be correlated with the electrical manifestations in series. The causes, however, must be different, for corporal disturbances are magnetically produced. 
Requests 22 incidents during firewall passage are difficult to maneuver, and the following parameters which are available are inadequate because of many complexities which are indefinite and inconsistent. Because of new reports observed, inconsistencies of some representations are suggested.
The most recent was in 1959, when two members of the Hunnton Museum noted that the object was silvered and 40 ft. in diameter and that it was followed by the flight of a red fireball.

Kalashnikov built a high-frequency induction magnetometer in 1944. This began a active research program on the flux changes produced by the earth's magnetic field. He constructed a 200-turn and a coil of insulated wire of several meter turns attached to a fluxmeter which actuated a recorder. The fluxmeter was constructed to measure changes in the magnetic flux as small as 10^-5 oersteds. He permitted detection of fluxes as small as 10^-7 oersteds.

The induced e.m.f. in the coil was proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux. In 1945 showed that the sensitivity of the method could be increased by a factor of 10^3 over that of the ordinary magnetometer. The flux of 10^-4 oersteds, 0.5 per cent of the earth's magnetic energy, would induce a voltage at the terminals which could be converted into a frequency shift for radio transmission.

Kalashnikov believes that in a region(?) for this to occur is to the appearance of a front through which magnetic field lines are abruptly upset. Although the disturbances observed on the ground, or a deviation of the compass needle, be a sign of the magnetic disturbance, Kalashnikov found that the induced e.m.f. in his magnetometer coil was a strong indicator of the visual motion of the disturbance. This frequently was seven to ten minutes in advance of any visual observation.

And produced a radio noise at a frequency of 1 - 3 kc/s. This electromagnetic radiation was not conducted but radiated into space. And conducted similar experiments with more sensitive equipment. These results were essentially confirmed radio observations from meteors and from - to -1 magnitude in the frequency range from 1 to 30 mc/s, suggesting that this disturbance correlation obtained by Kalashnikov meteors and further investigations.

Material sources and static from lightening that could be considered. It is difficult to determine if this disturbance was real or imagined. A hand of radio noise was heard. According to Autapouch, there is a differential between the static which is received by reflection of a broadcast wave from the fireball. The former noises are certain, exciting sounds noticed on a "widen" background. These are based on radio noises and crack - sounds which are observed against normal broadcasting background and could be a manifestation of the fireball. On the other hand, the noises of the fireball were incoherent and electromagnetic signal, perhaps caused by ionization in the vicinity. The sound that should accompany the visual fireball motion has not been noted in the signals received from orbiting observations.

Radio patrol described it as a succession of short static which were heard in July 1964. On this date the patrol sighted a fireball. These noises were sporadic and were received best in the long-range short-wave reception, but some faint meteors were "unnoticeable" which some brighter meteors mentioned were occasionally observed during this lack of correlation to an inhomogeneities of the atmosphere. (Fig.) killing and instiniting made a pronounced fluctuation of signal independent of the fact that this radiation, which may be related to the success, is not known at the present time.

Apparenta very shortly mutual obscuring occurred simultaneously with the passage of a fireball could be attributed to a peculiar effect. So it is unlikely that various noises could be separated from the comments. I have some notes on the radio like, "Such a characteristic signals which, until at the time of the Pennsylvania fireball of January 1950, (24)" Crackling sounds were heard on radio during the fall of the Pennsylvania fireball of December 9, 1950, and during the intensive meteors observers of October 29, 1952. (15) On March 24, 1952, a piece of iron was detected by radar as an atmospheric near at the time the fireball passed; a review of the many reports of this type..."

Text extracted from the document:

of the literature on this subject has, however, failed to substantiate this statement, which is not referenced by Astapovich.(10)  Astapovich has suggested that certain features exhibited kilowatts of power can be omitted by the fireball sources of radio interference. A reception field of 10 to 100 microvolts per meter bandwidth, which would be needed only on the receivers with a 10-kc or more bandwidth. This could account for the relatively few reported instances of radio interference. Wide variations in radio-interference reception could also be explained if the intensity of the effect was a function of the relative direction of the trajectory and loose magnetic-field lines, i.e., if the emission had the sue to lensing-antenna-like effects.

Text from the document:

IOWANS SIGHT 
METEOR IN DAY

An extremely rare sighting
of a meteor was observed over Iowa 
late Sunday afternoon by at least two
witnesses, the Des Moines Register 
reported.

K. R. Newcomer, 2515 Thirty-
eighth St., reported he was driving
on Highway 92 near Martenshale in 
Warren County when he saw a bright
object in the western sky which was fol-
lowed by a yellow center. He 
said the flash was high in the 
west and a little to the north.

What apparently was the
same flash was seen by the
son of Mr. and Mrs. Fred Eder-
son of Randolph, while his 
parents were driving south of 
Fremont on Highway 92. 

The flash lasted only about 
2 or 3 seconds, Newcomer 
said. It seemed to be north-
east of west.

Officials at the Smithsonian 
Astrophysical Observatory at
Cambridge, Mass., the home of
Project Bluebook, said they
were unable to identify the sight-
ing from the information avail-
able to them.

Neither a meteor nor a sat-
ellite had been reported from
another source which would facil-
itate their identification of the phe-
nomenon, the Observatory said.

"SGO 7-2"
PRIORITY NO. 12
JULY 21, 1968

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

This is a photocopy for forwarding your case XXXXX on the sighting of an unidentified flying object reported here.

It seems that there was an unusual sighting (Cumming County, Nebraska) similar to many others, including the shifting colors, a flashing effect and some peculiar maneuvering.

The day observer thought had been reported to Omaha, Kansas, and is assumed that this office may have questioned local law-enforcement agencies concerning the details of the sighting.

However, the more recent response of the local observer indicates that he may not have been fully satisfied with any previously made explanations of the sighting. Additional information or clarification of the investigation would be appreciated.

If any further significant information should come to your attention, we would be glad to receive it. The file on this case will remain open, pending the possible receipt of additional details that would aid in determining the nature of the reported sighting.

Your further cooperation will be most helpful, as the Air Force continues its program of investigating reports of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,
PHILLIP J. KLASS

MEMO
PHILIP J. KLASS 
Oct. 7, 1968

Dear Hector:

Reference the Wm. Powers/Cuming County, Nebr. UFO sighting mentioned in a quick-dirty map plot of UFO sightings and estimated direction of the UFO. The important question is whether Powers was actually an eyewitness or whether he only heard about the sighting? If he did indeed see it, we should try to obtain his first-hand account and details about the sighting which may have been recorded on your map.

I'm exploring the matter further with Rogers.

Dear Mr. _______,

This will reply to your letter dated July 31, 1968, at which time you desire additional information on the unidentified flying object (UFO) seen on July 20, 1968.

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation as to the unidentified aerial object you described. Unless some additional data is obtained by you and submitted for evaluation, our technical people will not be able to investigate this matter further.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the United States Air Force, which has a UFO investigator who is in a better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more complete analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the existing unidentified object by use of the categories of objects that are reported as UFO's in the Project Blue Book Report and Documentation.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. HIGMAN

Mr Philip J Klass called regarding UFO meteor sighting of 23 Jul 1963, and spoke with Lt Marano. Mr Klass has contacted the pilot who is going to get more exact azimuth and angular elevation data for the UFO. He has also contacted the pilot who sighted the meteor and is going to get a complete description from him. He called someone who wasn't in talked to Von Del Chamberlain for information on the trajectory.  told him that I had requested the trajectory from and had also sent him a copy of the case but that I didn't seem too interested to me. Mr Klass asked if I wouldn't request the information again because of the potential scientific value of the sighting. I replied that I would. Mr Klass also wanted a complete copy of the 23 July 1963 meteor sighting. This was sent to him on the afternoon of 14 October 1963.

OBSERVATION: Our fireball trajectories projects is an interim report on work done on 23 July 1964 concerning the fireball event observed over the north-central U.S. on 2 July 1964. This report is very interesting in the fireball and satellite observations made at that time. You can provide data on the trajectory of the fireball, along with any information on associated phenomena that you may have. This information would be appreciated and 1964 would be most useful.

1. Apparently an unidentified aerial object was observed by four individuals including two State Police officers at approximately 10:30 PM on the night of 25 July 1968 in Cuming County, Nebraska. The object was described as a luminous object that appeared to be maneuvering, and the observers felt that the object was under intelligent control.

2. FOR QUINTANILLA: The individuals involved in this sighting are extremely reliable people, and in view of the fact that two of the observers were State Police officers, I would tend to place considerable weight on their observations and descriptions. Please let me know what your evaluation of this sighting is and what action you may feel is appropriate.

Seems intelligent, doesn't want to say anything and gave no report, only said "Well, I saw a light in the sky. That's about all." States came close enough for details. Unable to say how far the object was, how high or in what direction it was moving, just that he saw it. Says he is quite familiar with aircraft and this was not any type he ever saw before. Reported that object moved suddenly away without any noise that could be heard and disappeared. Asked if aircraft were in the area at the time and said he didn't know of any. Stated that he was outside doing some work when he saw the object and he watched it for about 5 minutes.

Dear Hector:
As I long to know your interim report on the Omaha Fireball and the MIcors 1967.
This could prove to be a very important case.
P.s. You probably will not hear much from me for the next two weeks, since I will be crisscrossing Europe on a trip. When I return, (3) on being held by the CIA or DOD, on my last visit in Boston, Truth is that I am going skiing in Vermont and for 3 weeks, and shortly after I return to U.z. I will take a week to visit avionics companies in West Germany-this will be wrapped up writing my stories.
So please help to squeltch any of the above rumors.

METEORS, PLASMAS AND UFOS

An interim report on an unusual plasma-like UFO sighted in broad daylight northwest of Omaha, Nebraska, on July 28, 1968. According to the report, the object was moving very slowly at a uniform speed and emitting an intense light. The UFO location was approximately 120 miles southeast of Omaha.

This case provides circumstantial evidence which appears to confirm a hypothesis advanced earlier by residents: de Vries, Arne-Professor at the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, some plasma UFOs might be plasmatic created under frank conditions out of the wake of meteors.

Transcribed text from the document:

Early in September of 1960, the Air Force Project Blue Book office sent for the following UFO report which it had received from Washington.

[COPY]
JULY 29, 1968

Chief of Staff
U.S.A.F.
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

This is to report an Unidentified Flying Object as follows:

At about 2 P.M. July 28 on the farm in Cuming County, Nebraska, I became alarmed when my dogs began barking violently. Upon going outside, I observed in the pasture a disc-shaped object hovering above the ground about 30 feet. This object was very bright and appeared to be metallic. It was about 30 feet in diameter and about 12 feet thick. It gave off a brilliant glow but it was not an object - it was a phenomenon of light or electricity. The heavy and of the tee-drop was exposed the object and there was a strange buzzing sound coming from it - the object was emitting blue.

As I watched, it burst with a blinding light & then disintegrated into fragments of light. The fragments of light were so bright that it was impossible to look at them directly. As far as I have told no one except Mrs. Gromer. At the time it was on the ground 20 or more small balls seemed to have risen from the ground for ten or fifteen seconds.

Temperature was approx. 88-90 degrees. Sky was cloudless. Sun was very hot.

The instant reception captured a small but understandable number of seconds. There was no odor. This was not a man-made object nor was any human associated with it.

If you wish to question me, I am available.

Very sincerely,
[REDACTED]

The USAF has sent me one of its standard UFO report forms to fill out. From its responses, the following details emerge:

1. The sighting was approximately 2 p.m. and was emphasized "approximately."

2. The location of the sighting was estimated at "Approx. 30 sec."

3. When asked to describe the object's appearance, the witness denoted "Amorphous" - selfilluminated. No further details.

slightly higher than the high tension electric lines, but beyond them & in silhouette, was an object connected with them.
4. In reply to the question: "What drew your attention to the phenomenon?", I answered, "Its bright light."
5. In response to the question of how it finally disappeared, I wrote: "It disintegrated before my eyes."
6. Asked to compare the object's appearance to some familiar object, I wrote: "A bright glare. Some times I was reminded of a brilliant headlight." Further, "It did not move like an aircraft; the object moved steadily along the high tension line - the object seemed to disintegrate or disappear at the pole."
7. In a final summary, I wrote: "While I was working beside the pole short, I saw a glowing orange object in the trees. I was startled, but not connected to them in any way. Color was a dull orange-reddish, but not connected to them in any way. Almost simultaneously it disintegrated into many segments, each disappearing in a flash. I gave his age as 61. He said he had been a Colonel in the Army Air Corps - He claimed his sight had been average to good. He later learned he could not pass physical exams for locomotive.
On Sept. 13, 1966, I wrote:  introduct ing myself as a private UFO investigator I secured his identity, statement and background, which will be kept confidential. His reply is reproduced below in its entirety, despite some expressions which you may feel rather careless. Almost simultaneously it disintegrated into many fragments, each disappearing in a flash

The text in the document is as follows:

"When the UFO opened up or burst open, the inner thing was a very brilliant sun-like thing, like a magnesium flare, but this light grew fainter gradually, and finally disappeared. It made a low roaring or humming sound which was rather unique, and then there were three spheres, each of which went out separately 6 or 7 different times at intervals of 2 to 3 seconds - each time the diameter of the spheres seemed larger. No fragments, or pieces, of glass were found on the ground. There was no disturbance of the grass or foliage. When the thing disappeared there was 
a
 sudden rush of wind that was felt on the face and clothing.

The UFO which I have described is the third phenomenon I have observed in over 30 years. About 2 years ago I observed a similar happening, but this time the UFO was totally unlike any aircraft or object I have ever seen or heard of before. [A sketcher's sketch is redrawn below.]
If small traces of suspected droplets of lightning had been cast from S. to N. ever so lightly as it traveled, it could not have illuminated this pattern; and the pattern was very clean-cut.
More than 20 years ago, I observed a sun-descend ball of light or fire roll along a strip of pasture in sight of several witnesses. By memory of the distance, the size must have been 15 to 20 feet in diameter. This was a vague, glow-like thing, reminiscent of a burning ember but not destructive upon this distant land. It attracted strong attention to my remark.
This was not a transient phenomenon. The fire ball rolled a distinct distance."

Experienced UFO investigators usually become suspicious of "repeaters" -- persons who say they have frequently seen UFOs, but since they cannot produce any physical evidence to back up their claims and since their reports have many inconsistencies, they are considered unreliable informants.

Mr. says he spends much of his time out-of-doors with his "eyes peeled." Cuming County, Nebraska, where he allegedly observed the UFO, is a sparsely populated rural area, and it is doubtful whether their records showed any disturbance or outage on the lines through the ground from a supposed voltage breakdown.

The report states that the object seen was about 50 feet in diameter and 30 feet thick. The light was an estimated 6,500 volts and the lines are approximately 25 feet apart. Since the grounds are low resistance, it is assumed that the lines ran due east through the Cuming farm.

Shortly in response, Mr. sends a map with cast the report in a new light. It stated that the object had been sighted on July 28 at approximately 12:10 a.m., about 5 miles north-west of Albion, Boone County, IOWA.

There were numerous eyewitness reports on the matter, including one from the crew of a United Airlines plane approximately 180 miles east of the Atlantic headed west toward Omaha. Several ground observers at Atlantic, east of the object's reported location, also reported a "flaming object" moving at high speeds in a west to east direction. It is said if it could still see the object trail at an altitude estimated at 60,000 ft.

The investigators concluded that the matter was a "daytime astronomical phenomenon" called the "Omaha Firewall," whereby a large meteor or similar object, visible for miles, plunges earthward and sometimes explodes into fragments, giving the appearance of a "flying saucer." It was really the meteor firewall, and the possibilities are that a larger meteor or meteroite was burning out of the atmosphere, but not near the ground as had been reported.

Immediately asked how certain he was of the time of his sighting. Had he estimated the time or was it based on consultation with someone who noted the time? He said he had estimated the time, so his estimate was only approximate. He said he had returned to work "after a long noon hour which did not begin until well after 12 noon."

The image contains a photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The text describes the UFO as appearing to be a Polaroid print of a sighting, with details about the object's size, altitude, and movement. It also mentions other eyewitness accounts and observations.

It would be convenient if one could take out the possibility that it was merely a reflection of his local person. Unfortunately, this is not possible. The United States as a whole was interested in this, as discussed by the major journals of the day, and if the 60,000 ft. altitude was correct, an object at this attitude would be at least 10 miles across. .

show appeared Polaroid prints of the sighting, a circular luminous object with a flat bottom which sent out a beam of light from its edge. 10-15 feet in diameter, the object was at an altitude of 60,000 ft., with an estimated size of at least 10 miles across. No speed or exact altitude is unknown, it could not be used to exclude a reflection or distortion.

instead, I contacted a number of eyewitnesses and, without any mention of any photograph, obtained the following reports:

Here is a summary of their observations:

Objects (lens) appeared to be travelling straight up and down at a fast speed, remained in view for approximately 10 minutes. Estimate altitude was 60,000 to 70,000 ft. Estimate size (image) of the object was 30 to 50 feet in diameter. The object increased in size and reappeared from view at an elevation of 20 degrees. (Estimated.)

The western sky which was unobstructed, followed by a bright red ball of fire with a yellow flame tail. The initial object disappeared and was followed by a silent explosion and disintegration.

Reply to my letter: Observer was on ground in Atlantic; "I stood there with several others looking up in the eastern sky. We saw a small group of bright, fiery, colorful objects. They seemed to be travelling faster than any jet planes we have seen." The objects remained in the clouds for at least 10 minutes and then faded.

Reply to my letter: Ground observer in Atlantic: "I sighted several objects in the sky. They were golden in color and much larger than any jet aircraft I have ever seen. She drew a sketch."

showing a series of concentric rings, which I presume to be clouds. The inner core was marked: "Red and brilliant orange colors plus some bluish intermingle."
The report form was marked "Witness colors" and the outer ring: "light pinkish colors".
Through the kindness of , whose sister-in-law lives near Atlantic, we received several clippings of unknown date from what I presume to be regarding the sighting of three objects.
was quoted as describing it this way: "It looked like the moon in the middle of the sky, and my first thought was that it was a burning plane, then I realized it would have to be 3 times the size of a 747. It showed pulsations like a rapidly revolving light bulb or a landing beacon - colored like a ball of phosphorus, leaving a trail of smoke in its wake."
Another clipping, presumably from the same newspaper, but a later issue, tells of the visit by authorities to Northeast Nebraska following the sighting. A Nebraska man, from western town, is quoted as saying, that the "visitor" was probably traveling from a northwesterly to a southeasterly direction."
If this estimate is correct, the saucer's path would have taken it roughly over the area where the reported UFO sighting had occurred.
returned to the Offutt Air Force later in the year to face off the distance to the power lines and recheck his memory, and from information provided by other reliable sources. He believes that the UFO sightings could have come from a "very large object, probably in the nature of a mother ship, or a satellite-TV type of craft." 
All the evidence points to the fact that this may well over Atlantic probably taking a mistake or a star sighting description of the UFO is that it faded away gradually. A second description of the UFO is that it disappeared gradually in a stepped fashion, it seems safe to rule out the possibility of any ballistic objects, except for some type of controlled descent.
The activity of the observation period of the UFO closely matched the time period of the motion of several celestial objects. All observers of the UFO seemed to agree that it appeared to be a bright stationary object. All observers of the UFO seemed to notice the same activity and described the UFO as being stationary.
Impressions have been on numerous? - an illusion caused by the red fireball? (I express no opinion at all on this subject.)
On 13, I wrote and in the closing portion of my letter I asked
If it was possible that when he has more actual data on the meteor or whatever was seen, might really have been a meteor some 15 miles away, and not a few yards away, to see what his reactions would be to this suggestion?

The object was first observed hovering over a field to the south. As the truck approached the object moved closer and we could see it was a flat, disc-shaped craft about 60 feet in diameter. It had a metallic, mirror-like surface that reflected the sunlight. The object moved very silently and smoothly, rising vertically when our truck approached. It disappeared from sight after reaching an altitude of about 1000 feet.

HOW LONG WAS THE PHENOMENON IN SIGHT? 
ABOUT 5 MINUTES.

OCR Text Output:
The UFO was not in the nature of an explosion. It hung fixed in the nature, and clear. the complete outline from upper tip to lower end was sharp and fixed. The total estimated time of observation was between 20 to 30 seconds. As it departed, it ripped apart. I saw the solid interior. Then the interior condensed into fragments, and the fragments went out.
"Any way, your letter is correct -- the UFO could have been at ANY height and distance, and shown such details from such a distance (say, 1 mile?). Yet vision from the ground may miss some details through comparisons, and VISION "is somehow at fault for not acknowledging this previously, but my illusion was so clear."
"Yes, it is possible the UFO might have been a meteor exploding at any distance, and any altitude, but what the eye saw fixed in space, that the tear drop outline was clear and there NO movement as in a trajectory."
Clearly Mr. ... has recorded a comment that the UFO "as do some observers, for which he is to be complimented."
Quite early in my own examination of the UFO problem, I was confronted by colleagues at the University of Arizona who displayed their concern that UFOs and planetary laboratory proposed that, as since the wave of an entering meteoroid is a plasma which is a metallic state was ionization, perhaps vertical relations on the meteor-wake boundary could spin off masses of incandescent plasma that are reported as a UFO..."
President: I have been able to track down the scientist who advanced this novel idea, he is a former Commander of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. Personally, I was not engaged in plasma physics research and since the company's interests in this field are more come to an end.
On Jan. 28, 1959, I wrote him telling him only briefly of a recent UFO case. In his brief reply of Jan. 7, 1959, he outlined his ideas, which he has done, informally, in his reply.
This report has been prepared as an interim status report for a handful of scientists who may be interested in this case in the hope of spurring interest and comment.

DEAR MR. KLASS:

It is with great pleasure that I read your interesting letter of December 20, 1968. I would like to congratulate you, as you are involved in a case of possibly a case of scientific importance: the entrance of a large meteor into the atmosphere.

Some fifteen years ago I became involved in theoretical and experimental research in the field of atmospheric entry phenomena. As a result of these studies, I became intrigued by plasmoids (ball lightning) occurring in nature.

In answer to an implied question in your letter, I would like to offer a few of the thoughts that have occurred to me regarding the phenomena that may be associated with the entrance of meteors through the atmosphere.

Among the great number of ball lightnings reported over the last few years were many that diameters up to several meters and with an observed lifetime of tens of minutes. In many cases the reports indicate the absence of thunder, storm conditions or even clouds in the area.

It is more than difficult to construct a model of a plasmoid or electrical discharge that is like as more minutes if we assume that it is created from magnetic hydrodynamic processes of our atmosphere only. However, the entry of a large meteor into the wake of a meteor is sufficient to cause complete ionization, whereas the plasma produced by a lightning strike is only partially ionized.

The volume of the plasma produced in the deceleration zone and augmented by the strong magnetic fields associated with the motion of the large meteor is greater than the volume of plasma generated by a lightning discharge. This, together with the high velocity of the large plasma leads to the shedding of large plasma episodic in the shockzone.

The passage of meteors through the atmosphere has been observed to generate strong electromagnetic fields. (On the twenty-four occasions a meteor entry in the Southwest had been observed, it was followed within 5 minutes by an electromagnetic transient such as might cause a given plasma eddy to be established into a plasmoid. It might also provide the force lines along which high voltage arcs might occur.)

such a plasmoid might be moved from the high altitude of its formation down- wards to lower altitudes, against its buoyancy.

This characteristic of plasmoids, to move along magnetic force lines, seems to be common for many reported sightings, as for instance, the descending course frequently mentioned (as greatest speed) and the prevalence of their occurrence near transformer stations and similar situations.

The observed long life of some plasmoids is difficult to interpret if they are assumed to contain gases of our atmosphere only. cases of high ionization electrical, which indicate the presence of charged particles, like lightning, have to be considered, which would give an idea of the consequences the passage of the components of a plasmoid, of elements of the ionized end of the table, with their high concentration potentials, should substantially extend its life.

I know of only few reported observations of the collapse of ball lightning cases of recombination energy, by describing carbonized vegetation and sand fused into glass at the point of ground contact.

I hope that the foregoing will help you to show that a rather large body of evidence points in the direction of our present report, and that a consideration should be given to the possibility that a considerable number of supposedly unexplained UFO-occurrences could be plausibly interpreted as theories that belong to science fiction.

Sincerely yours,
