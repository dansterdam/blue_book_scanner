1962-10-6977060-Naha-Okinawa-8162-
1. On 6 October 1962, at about 1845 hours, local time, the writer, Lt Col George R. Crowley, observed a luminous object in the sky near Naha AFB, Okinawa.
2. The object was first observed in the western sky at an elevation of approximately 50 degrees. It was a bright yellowish-white light, somewhat larger in diameter than a star. The object remained stationary for 2-3 minutes and then began to slowly move northward, changing its shape and color slightly as it moved.
3. After moving northward for approximately 2 minutes, the object began to diminish in brightness and eventually disappeared from sight at about 1855 hours, local time, at an azimuth of about 330 degrees and an elevation of approximately 20 degrees.
4. During the time the object was observed, the sky was clear with good visibility and the moon was not a factor. There were no aircraft in the immediate vicinity as far as the observer could determine.
5. No sound was heard during the observation of the object.
6. The observer, Lt Col George R. Crowley, is an experienced pilot with over 5,000 hours of flying time, the majority of which is jet aircraft time. He is considered to be a reliable and competent observer.

CASE NO. 8162 
NAHA, OKINAWA 6 OCTOBER 1962
DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:
At approximately 2030 hours on 6 October 1962, three military policemen, on routine patrol at Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, observed a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to the west, at an approximate elevation of 15 degrees. It was estimated to be about 2 to 3 thousand feet in altitude and approximately 1 to 2 miles from their position. The light was observed for about 5 to 10 minutes, during which time it was seen to move across the sky in a generally northerly direction at a relatively slow speed. The light was described as very bright, nearly as bright as the full moon, and it appeared to be a single solid object with no strobe or pulsating effects. At no time was the object seen to increase or decrease in speed or altitude. The night was clear with unlimited visibility.
CONCLUSION:
This incident is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The object sighted did not conform to the normal characteristics of any known aerial vehicles or natural phenomena. The report is considered credible, since it was made by trained military observers under optimum viewing conditions. No further investigation was deemed necessary.
