DATE - TIME GROUP: 23 JAN 65 23 55
LOCATION: LAKEWOOD, CALIFORNIA
SOURCE: ADULT MALE, CIVILIAN
NUMBER OF OBJECTS: COULD NOT BE DETERMINED
LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 7-8 MINUTES
TYPE OF OBSERVATION: VISUAL
COURSE: WEST TO EAST
PHOTOS: NONE
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE

CONCLUSION: I BELIEVE IT WAS CAUSED BY FLARES. THE OBJECT(S) APPEARED TO BE VERY BRIGHT - BRIGHTER THAN A STAR AND MOVED ACROSS THE SKY IN A STRAIGHT, STEADY COURSE FROM WEST TO EAST IN APPROXIMATELY 7-8 MINUTES. THERE WERE SEVERAL SUCH OBJECTS MOVING INDEPENDENTLY AND ALSO IN CLUSTERS. IT WAS A VERY BRIGHT, PINPOINTED LIGHT - MUCH BRIGHTER THAN A STAR. THESE APPEARED TO BE MAN-MADE DEVICES, POSSIBLY FLARES, RATHER THAN ANYTHING EXTRATERRESTRIAL.

The image appears to contain a diagram and instructions, but does not include a photograph. The diagram shows an object's appearance relative to the horizon line, and instructions for how to draw a picture to show the motion and direction of the object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" or the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
