Brilliant Meteor Seen 
By Many Here Saturday

A brilliant meteor seen in broad daylight was reported by a number of Tacoma residents who were amazed to see such a sight shortly after the moon Saturday. 
Among the callers to The Tacoma Tribune office was Frank A. Reds of 5019 So. L. who said he saw the meteor's "silver streak" that looked like a rocket streak and left a trail.
As they watched, it turned downward and disappeared.
D. J. Moran of 9804 American Ave. S.W. said he saw an oblong object, shining down behind some trees, and he thought it to be a crashing plane.
Others described it in various terms, some thinking of it as a flying saucer, but all here who saw it were unanimous that it appeared luminous and of high speed. 
Tacoma, however, was not the only point of vantage to see the celestial visitor as it was witnessed generally over the entire Northwest. Following is a report:

Russian Furs 
Carried Back

NEW YORK, Aug. 19 - A shipment of $15,000 worth of Russian furs refused unloaded was still aboard the ship today despite a 24-hour deadline imposed by longshore-men.

Dr. A. Francis Arcier
Scientific Advisor
United States Air Force
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Ohio

Dear Dr. Arcier:

How very kind you have been to me in taking your valuable time to investigate and report back to me concerning the bright August day in 1950. I saw reflected in Puget Sound on that bright August day in 1950.

Never in my life had I heard of a fireball. Now I feel superior to my friends in that not only do I know what one is, but also I am among the few who have seen one. In addition, I can, from now on, relate this experience from my own observation of it.

With your permission, I shall use a substantial part of your letter in my weekly Sunday column to the Tacoma (Wash.) News Tribune, probably next week. I shall send you a clipping.

Again, many thanks for this great privilege to have met you and I sincerely hope our paths may somehow bring us together again.

Sincerely yours,

The information given you is in no way classified, so there is no objection to your using it in your regular Sunday column.

I will be very glad indeed to receive a clipping.

Dear Miss Walker:

Here is my reply to your letter of 27 June 1950 regarding an unusual sighting observed by you and others in the Tacoma area and other parts of Washington on the 30th of August 1950.

Our records indeed indicate that there was a UFO reported from Washington State, and at precisely this time on 30 August 1950. Our records of investigation and analysis indicate the following:

a. The object was a solid, metallic phenomenon, as is it not unusual for such unexplainable metallic craft to be observed.
b. The object was an extremely high speed and altitude, more commonly known as a Fireball. These objects are quite common in our atmosphere.
c. The identity of the object was confirmed by the independent observation of private individuals.

A point of explanation is in order here, as we generally do not have more definitive information on these types of phenomena. Objects in the earth's upper atmosphere can, but do not always, produce a large, glowing image intact as a large, flowing mass until they disintegrate at lower levels. These bodies soon appear very often during meteoric showers. Records indicate that the majority of people have an encounter with one, and an encounter with one can indeed be a startling experience.

The Project of Project of Pennsylvania under Dr. Robert R. Menner has been carrying out research on certain portions of the so-called "scientific aspects" of fireballs. As may find of interest, which, I am told, some 35-year survey, the largest number of meteors and fireballs appear in August.

The incidents to which you so kindly want me is so similar to the "fireball" incident of 1957 which drew nation-wide notice from the press, radio and TV, the fireballs were observed by hundreds of persons, including pilots in the air, simultaneously from six states.

I need hardly state that such a large number of observers are still firmly convinced that what they observed was no ordinary fireball.

May I again thank you for the courtesies extended the Air Force representatives and for your sincere interest and understanding in the matter.

Sincerely yours,

A. FRANCIS ARCHER 
Scientific Advisor

Dear Dr. Arcier:

Perhaps you will remember me as being the only woman who was present at the briefing in which you participated on June 20, in the office of Congressman John E. Henderson of Ohio. I was there representing Congressman Tollefson who was out of town.

You will find enclosed photostatic copies of two articles which appeared in the Washington News & Sunday Radar. These give the details regarding the incident to which the briefing session pertained.

The Article which appeared August 20, 1950, was printed the day following the one was - when I wrote the article which you appended a letter.

You very kindly offered to look back in the files and try to determine for me what it is you recall and/or explanation the Airforce has on this incident. I shall be looking forward to hearing from you on this matter.

Sincerely yours,
