The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book record, specifically record number 10973, dated December 21, 1952, located in Los Alamos, New Mexico. The object observed was evaluated as an astro (meteor) and the brief summary and analysis describes it as a brilliant green, very fast speed object that appeared suddenly, had a short tail of flame, and then shortly went out. The observation was ground-visual, with a 65-70 degree angle, and there was no physical evidence.
