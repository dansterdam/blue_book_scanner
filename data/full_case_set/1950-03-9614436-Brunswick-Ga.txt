The shared image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report discussing a UFO sighting that occurred in Brunswick, Georgia on March 9, 1950.

The text in the document reads as follows:

SAUCER OVER BRUNSWICK
BRUNSWICK, Georgia, March 9
From 1,800 to 2,000 miles an hour. The objects were observed by estimated the altitude, distance, and time elapsed in flight.
The objects first were seen crossing toward the southwest, then disappeared and were discovered again going north.
Those who saw the objects estimated they had never before been seen here. Frank Franks, a retired officer, watched the objects through binoculars and said they definitely were shaped like a saucer, but flat on bottom.
The description was substantiated by others, including four experienced aviators. A. J. M. Richardson, both members of the Brunswick Civil Air Patrol, were flying in separate small planes and watched the objects blow past them at St. Simons Island Airport and found two others who had been watching the strange craft from the ground.
The objects, they said, were by many persons who thought they were flying in ordinary planes until they passed overhead at tremendous speed. The aviators together said the speed of the craft was greater than any commercially known plane.
