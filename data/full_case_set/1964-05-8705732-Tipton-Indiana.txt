The text found in the document is as follows:

This report, investigated on 8 may 1964, concerns a bright light seen in the sky by several persons in the Tipton, Indiana area on the night of 7 may 1964.

The light was first seen in the northwest at about 8:15 p.m. EDT. It appeared to be hovering and then slowly moved in a southerly direction. At one point it seemed to go down below the trees and then reappear in the same general area. It was described as being very bright, sometimes flashing, and reflecting on the ground. The light was observed for over an hour by several persons within about a 15 mile radius of Tipton.

Detailed descriptions were received from XXXXX XXXXX of Tipton and XXXXX XXXXX of XXXXX, Indiana. XXXXX stated that his wife and children also saw the object. XXXXX advised that the object was low over his house which is located about 7 miles north of Tipton. He said he could see stars through the light and that it was about the size of a basketball held at arm's length. He stated it hovered and then moved around the area for about an hour before slowly disappearing.

It is considered that the light observed could have been a military or other aircraft, a planet, a meteor, or a balloon. There is no evidence that this sighting involves an unidentified flying object.
