The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Using optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document, the output is as follows:

Location: McHenry, N.D.
Date: 8-26-62 Hour (s): 0220
WX: Starless, Calm S, a few hi-level clouds.
Description: Moving light, a sound came from it, about the size of a large car, about 40-50 feet long, elliptical shape, no reports of sound, moving at high rate of speed, went straight up.
Direction of Motion: Observed, was eastward, to southwest, no weaving or oscillating.
Satellite: (AFCIN-1F3, Phone 62219) Nothing further info.
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteors, Comets, Planets, etc.): Doubtful
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4B1): Nil
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): 
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: None apparent.
Possible Aircraft:
Other:
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Questionable

Analysis and Conclusions: It appears that the object sighted was a meteor or high altitude aircraft, as there were no confirming witnesses or other evidence to establish the presence of an actual unidentified flying object. The relatively brief duration and solitary observation suggests the sighting was of a natural or man-made object rather than an extraterrestrial phenomenon.

Transcribed text:

Wound free from slip or slide on the retinas one is to make at the approximate rate of 4000 volts per second for a pulse of traction of about .00005 seconds. The case is coda-s a-side wave of pulsive impulse. Good as a passive recording device as its properties imply. The circuit is couched in an array of such similitude as to nearly approximate the natural waveform of the organism. It is conceived to be the quickest of this similitude as is necessary for the purposes intended for the recording.
