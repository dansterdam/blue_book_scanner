1. Reference the attached correspondence, dated 5 Jun 65, subject as above. Letter is forwarded for action as appropriate.

2. This office, in cooperation with USAF SPACETRACK, was unable to correlate this observation with any event of which we have record. All foreign and domestic satellite devices were identified and accounted for as of the period of observation. The GT 4 sustainer body, SPADATS object number 1391, this steady observation occurred approximately 16 hours after launch, did not produce the observation was the GT 4 sustainer body. SPADATS Object number 1391 this steady observation occurred approximately 16 hours after launch, did not produce the observation was from the general location rather than northwest. In addition, there is no record of any satellite reentry or deorbit during this period.

3. We consider the possibility of the visual sighting of antennae or optical or decay substances as being extremely unlikely.

4. Any assistance you can provide Mr. [redacted] will be appreciated.

Sighted a satellite in the north-west at approximately 8:50 PM on June 5, 1965. The object was observed traveling in a northeasterly direction at an estimated speed of 15-20 minutes per degree. It appeared to be brightly lit and after several minutes it disappeared into the haze. I have no explanation for what this object may have been.
