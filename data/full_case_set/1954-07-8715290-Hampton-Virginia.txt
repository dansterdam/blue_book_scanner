Between the lines of fright on the beach, I sensed the space man by the way pointed the stick. He also said "see to it to be the first to carry" that the space man laughed like am eight year old said over and over it. He also said it was the first time that the strange thing happened to him before. I told him that the contents of attention wouldn't allow this to be possible. Strangely he told many things which I will gladly relate to you as you cannot write me, or in writing to [Redacted].

Montain View Farm, Massachusetts is the sole destination of our meeting. The fact that we hadn't discussed the necessity if you would it should be must be that way. The space men trusted with of us to keep secrets in it will take courage to write this letter to you Mr. [Redacted] as I hope yours will wipe away the matter lightly.

After visiting Mr. [REDACTED] in Phoebus, I got little and a spent some time at his home there. As far as we could determine from the report, we cannot find any grounds for doubt that he states facts when he says he saw a brilliantly lighted object move rapidly across the sky to the south. I am convinced this is a genuine "incident", but the origin and nature of the object are still not clear to me.

We arrived there for my second visit on Dec 28, 1954. The space man [REDACTED] had spent all day Christmas with Mr. [REDACTED] and had made this recording.

My tape recording is which was left on the recording. Here it is - just exactly as it was taken from the recording word for word.

This is a tape recording made in the home on Christmas day 1954. My distant cousin [REDACTED] is here with me. I will say a few words to all of you America and all the world. The most voice could come from distant voice. OK.

This is to advise you that the Navy reporting this report is a case that came to our attention on 30 June 1954. It was observed at 1951 hours on 28 June 1954 by members of the Norfolk Naval Air Station at Norfolk, Va. This device was observed a short b time and was lost to sight. It was described as round and "glowing at the bottom" and exhibited a pulsating type motion at the time of the reported sighting. Instrument data, visual observations and radar observations secured at the time indicated that the reported sighting could have been a weather balloon. However, and fast that no further investigation is necessary in this instance and that no further follow-up action is contemplated.

Dear Sir:

I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. J. Edgar Hoover in which he tells me that he has referred my letter to him to your office. This letter is regarding a man of my acquaintance by name of *********** of Mt. View, Missouri. He claims to have been taken to Washington D. C. for interrogation concerning a ride he allegedly took in a flying saucer to Venus. He claims to have letters from the Air Force verifying his story, and is selling books on the strength of this, giving his true experiences. Would you please refer to my letter to Mr. Hoover and answer any questions concerning this man. If he is lying about this, and using the Air Force or FBI to verify it, then he is using the mails to defraud it seems. He says you have the negative to a picture he took of these flying saucers.
I appreciate your consideration. This is of great interest to me.
Yours truly,

Dear Mr. Wilson,

Relative to your hand been passing related to an investigation of U.F.O. which has not yet made public, you will probably have this letter come to you a manner of a method to that as a may fact similar what is in Detroit & Missouri farmer talked to each other on the telephone & told their experiences, I being connected to this matter, to make and be resume m a space thing. 

On July 20th, 1954 Mr. [redacted], from [redacted], Michigan and I visited him at his home in [redacted], Michigan. We met and talked our suspicion or investigation on the mysterious craft in the air. At this moment, I have to your home in [redacted] and there was a great to move around your home in Bloomfield Hills. I thank you have been to your office a lot of work in the same area. 

I used to move through [redacted] during 1950s, and I also have very clear information this letter is not coming to your from someone at the Government agency, this is purely a private citizen, m.e.

On July 30th, 1954 Mr. [redacted] saw a strange luminous craft. I have no photo ad. It was a very bright light, some were in the mountains of the vicinity, and was estimated to be from three to five hundred feet in diameter. Some witnesses have seen [redacted] at this time. He also phoned the State police and reported what he had seen, to the Air Force Base there also.

I doubt that you have time to look into this matter, but if you or anyone in your office can do it, please let me know. I will be more than willing to cooperate with any investigation any place.

Yours very truly,

Honey,

I just saw the object and perhaps that was not down out of sight below the tree out of my sight. The 6:01 is perhaps only a slip up of my sight, and what seemed to be the tree out of my sight. The 8:01 was a round ball it seemed to go up into a tree and what seemed to be drop out of sight. When I came out to the porch to get a better view it was gone. The object was a reddish glow and seemed to only stay a few minutes then it disappered. When I came out into the drive it had apparently cleared the trees and I could not locate it again. The light seemed to change appearance and perhaps this is also what I thought I saw. But I do think this is a rather strange story that I think I can confirm as an observation.

I would appreciate it if you could get in touch with those fellows with the telescopes. They may have spotted it too and perhaps can tell me more about what I saw. Otherwise, I'm left really wondering just what I saw and I would be very interested to follow up on it. Let me know if you hear anything, okay? Let me know if you learn that anyone else may have seen it from the areas.

Have a regular station here on fly nights - first time today is haze a little active but yet not enough to really do much - on June 30 about 4 pm Tenn could not make out at all - as seen on day light and the strange side and star shapes - moving at times slowing rapidly - more different types at times. At nine we could not see them but got bright flashes on west side of the sky - must be something there if we could only locate them. Might different than ours altogether. Not worth much reporting alone, let me know if you have any other reports that may give me a clue I am sending this along.
