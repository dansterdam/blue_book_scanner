34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 16 April 1964

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
On March 31, 1967 at about 10:30 p.m. I was in my backyard in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, facing north, when I noticed a light low on the horizon. It started and stopped and started again, descending until it was quite low in the sky and seemed to stop and hover. It appeared to change color from white to a reddish orange. It then seemed to start moving across the sky in a northerly direction. It stopped and started again, finally seeming to go out of sight. The object was visible for about 10 minutes. It seemed to be at an altitude of perhaps a thousand feet or less. The motion and changing colors were most unusual. I have seen many lights in the sky, but this was quite different from anything I have ever seen before. I am quite familiar with planes, satellites, and normal celestial objects, and this was not like any of those. I am convinced that what I saw was some type of unidentified flying object. I would be glad to answer any other questions you might have.

the object was oval in shape and appeared quite silvery. Its movement was quite erratic, going at an extremely rapid speed then stopping and hovering for a few minutes. This object was observed about 1:00 a.m. on 1-1-67 by myself and my wife, and was over our house for about 15 minutes. Its movements were very unusal and quite unlike anything we had ever seen before. When it finally went out of sight it was still moving at a high rate of speed.

We went out on the porch to get a better view. It was reddish-orange in color and appeared to be flashing or pulsating. After a few minutes it suddenly accelerated and took off at a high rate of speed, disappearing over the horizon. It was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. The whole event lasted 5-10 minutes. We were very puzzled by what we saw and would like to know if you have any explanation for this. Any information would be appreciated. Please let me know if you need any further details."

The light gradually dimmed and faded away.

9-50 Rest Weight Distribution Air Force Base Dayton, Ohio
Dear Sirs,
I hope you will give this sighting consideration, even though I am 15 years old. On March 31, 1967 between 10:45 and 11:00 someone called and said a "red light" moving over your house. I went outside and saw a red light moving slowly from west to east across the sky. At first it showed as a light moving slowly, then it diminished and finally could no longer be seen. It pulsated. Gradually the light got dimmer and dimmer faded away. I waited for it to come back but it did not. The next day another person told me that it was a helicopter, but she also heard one moving across the sky that she says looked like a plane, only it was a red light. I honestly believe what I saw was something unconventional and I would be very interested to know what you think about it.
Sincerely,
[Signed]

Friday March 29, 1967
At 7:15 P.M. a man reported that while he was driving on route 303 near Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, he observed a light in the sky that was first about the size of a dime at arm's length, then grew rapidly larger, about 40 to 45 feet in diameter. He said it remained stationary for 2 minutes, then started to oscillate back and forth, and finally remained stationary again. It made no sound. He had time to stop his car and get a good look at it. This was described as a disk-shaped object with a row of lights around the perimeter. It finally disappeared behind some trees. The man claimed to be a highly responsible person, and gave the writer the impression of credibility. This was thought to be a valid sighting, although unfortunately, no photographs were obtained. This incident occurred at the time of the sighting.

Transcription of the text:

March 28, 1967
It was 7:55 p.m. and we had just finished eating dinner. As I looked out the window, I noticed a bright light approaching from the southwest. At first I thought it was an airplane, but as it got closer, I could see it was not an airplane, but some type of flying object. It appeared to be round or oval in shape and had a dull reddish-orange color.

The object hovered over the trees for about 5 minutes and then started to move again, this time toward the east. As it moved, it seemed to wobble or flutter slightly. The object then disappeared behind some trees. About 5 minutes later, it reappeared, now moving in a westerly direction. It moved very rapidly and seemed to be oscillating or vibrating as it went. The object then disappeared from view, moving off in the distance.

The entire sighting lasted around 8-10 minutes. At about 9:00 p.m., the object reappeared, this time higher in the sky. It remained visible for only a minute or two before disappearing again.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line that shows the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show the position of the object when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object, and a "B" on the compass when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the end of the path, and show by arrows the course taken in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they

The text in the document states:

Proposed reply to letter from AUG 2, 67 (34.8T)

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference your recent letter in which you reported your observations of May 10, 1967. With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essential data such as size, speed, altitude, color, maneuvers, etc. are quite important in a complete evaluation. If you had reported your observation to your nearest military installation at the time, an evaluation would have been possible. The local UFO investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your nearest military installation is:

910 Troop Carrier Group
Youngstown Municipal Airport
Vienna, Ohio 44473
Phone: area code 216; 372-3551 ext 2

The information on your unidentified observations will be added to our present data base.

The enclosed information on Project Blue Book may be of interest to you. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear Mr. -----

With respect to your unidentified observation of March 30, 1957, which was reportedly different types of an explanation from the information submitted, as mentioned, we do not find sufficient characteristics of the case which would indicate a comprehensive evaluation. Your information will be added to our data base.

Had you reported your observation to the nearest Air Force base at the time, an evaluation would have been possible. The nearest Air Force installation is:
