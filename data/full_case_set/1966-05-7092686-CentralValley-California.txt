May whom it may concern,

On the after noon of May 17,1966 between 11:50 + 12:00 A.M. I glanced out the window and I saw a object that looked like a spool of thread. It was over a field about 500 or more yards away. I don't know how high it was. Just that it looked like it was over a woods. It looked like it was made of some shiny metal. It could be some kind of material that was in the shape at first I thought I thought it was over the trees, but as I watched it, it just hovered, until it disappeared. That night I was watching the 6:00 news and they had people on tv that saw UFO's that say they never though of sending it in, because I never thought of sending it in before.

Hind sight:

There seems to have existed objects over central valley at 8:06 p.m. same evening. No explanation offered at time of incident.

I. The more you can off
2. Some sort of lights of a pointed shell color
3. A pointed thing
4. Apparently later glass.
5. The object was white.
3 seen at 9 from my dining room windows. when I went into the kitchen and came back the trail of smoke still quite visible. The objects were traveling at a high rate of speed and straight as a string course. It went by in the middle of the sky until out of sight. I went by the west window to see if it were a blast, but nothing.
The cloud was a bright with a split parallel shape to it.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten report or document. The text in the document appears to be a description of an unidentified aerial phenomenon or "UFO" sighting.

Text extracted from the document:

I can't think of any other explanation for the most remarkable occurrence of this evening's experience, as a bright light zoomed across the sky with a loud roar for about a minute. At first I thought it was just the normal high flying jet, but it seemed to be travelling much faster than the average jet, and the light was much brighter. As the object passed overhead I could see it was not a jet, but an extremely bright light that seemed to pick up speed as it travelled from east to west. There was no discernible noise, just a very bright light that seemed to be glowing. I phoned the local newspaper office to report the incident, but they were not able to give me any information on what the object might have been.

300 feet off the ground. Varied in size. It was a definite object and not the ordinary weather phenomena. The first go by here at 1130 and he came back again. When he came the second time, the object seemed clearer. The first leaves the observer from the rear. And the object seems to ease it off from the rear.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: Monday Feb 19, 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

On Monday evening at the 24th of May 1966 at 8:30 p.m. - Patricia Strapponni and I, Annette M. Strapponni, went to the home of Patricia's dad, Helgio E. Zampini, in the hopes of seeing anything unusual we might see in the sky. We are done this before, because many same things seem to happen and some unusual night events occur before sunrise. The night was clear, and the stars were visible, and there were clouds, but the stars were visible directly overhead. Looking toward a south-easterly direction, we could see a bright red star-like object hovering about 3120 feet in the sky. We saw this about 120 minutes.

I also have several pictures that were taken in May of 1966. These were given to me.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

After watching it for a while we crossed over to the rear of my house. From there we could see another good object that was much more illuminated than the one we were watching. This object was now to the west and in the first quarter. We then went back to watch from the same position, but these objects could not be seen again. Even though the night was very still, we could hear no sound from the objects. After watching to go home, I went and told my neighbors about the sighting. I saw more object with a silver dome, crossing very silently. It seemed to drop down towards the south-west and then started back up, watching to go home. As I arrived it had just crossed over the high tension wires, behind the trees, and out of view. As I began to turn off the porch light, and look to the left from the tree, I saw a large red object in the same position as previously, hanging there, and, another. Four in all - the first having led was out of view; but the three following were one behind the other. We could hear a sound but it was some kind of a sound but we hastened. The time was about 9:30 p.m. and we also sighted a USA experimental plane flying overhead. At first we thought it was another UFO but the location and altitude told us that it was a conventional plane. We could see that it was definitely a plane with all the characteristics that it created a beautiful sight, almost directly over our heads. About 10:15 p.m., both red objects vanished. Certain ladies are very prone to comment on these sightings and are not averse to seeking publicity - but rather unwilling to share what they have seen with others. It was a very nice interview and we are happy to present it in Probe. Thank you.

Dear Sir,
I hope you will forward this letter to the correct office. It is a description of an "Unidentified Flying Object" (UFO) which my wife and I saw last night. First seen: 10:00AM to 5 minutes to 10:30 AM, May 24, 1966. Duration: 6 to 7 minutes. Location: Rowan-Morven Hotel, Flower, Italy. It looked like a very bright white star, brighter than any visible in sky at time. Sound came from different course, heading up from horizon towards direction of this UFO. Observed very quiet night. So far have heard no one else mention seeing it about 60Â° West of from. Speed not constant, but variable. Almost stopped at times. Course not straight, but slowly changing, upward to be wandering slightly. Clear sky. Disappeared by slowly fading out over a period of 5 to 10 minutes.

Gentlemen,

I am writing a report concerning several UFO's, witnessed by myself and several others who were with me at different times.

The first and most prominent one was an object I saw flipping, tumbling and rolling in the sky. The object, which I think was oval, was about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. This was on May 23, 1966. The object seemed to be glowing as though.

It glowed a dull orange-red, resembling a series of maneuvered for approximately half an hour.

It seemed to be looking for something. When I could no longer observe it, it had disappeared from the horizon.

- page 27 -

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text describing a reported UFO sighting.

The text reads:

"Report the maneuver. 
Then it stopped for a few seconds and moved about fifty feet of course, it's only an estimate.
Suddenly the movement was tremendous and it glowed unusually bright and flowered off toward a 30Â° angle to the west and disappeared. This appeared another one was reported two changes in light and followed the first. I watched them until they had gone.
The night had been a clear moon or cloudy, only a few scattered hints of St Bartschlains.
By a week after, both my family and I watched several UFO's which were in times of tree flying at a very high altitude."

There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains handwritten text that appears to be a letter or report from an individual describing their experience with a UFO sighting.

Text from the document:

At a party last a date which three flew over quite low, flying formation. These were very highly brighter than any star I've ever seen. Each was a single white light. 

The reason I was so long in contacting you was because I didn't have any authority.

I am in the Air Force here and I think they are something in our ships that doesn't belong there.

Our duty is to gain and maintain morale in supremacy through a constructive public relations. I believe that great simply because we seem to ignorant to accept what we don't understand.

I thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
