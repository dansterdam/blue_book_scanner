Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before? If so, give date and location.
Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? If you answered YES, did they see the object too?
Please list their names and addresses.
Please give the following information about yourself: [Redacted personal information]
When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?

There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains a sketch depicting a curved line and a compass rose diagram.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear Sir:

I would like to report an object I saw in the sky on Friday, October 7, 1966. It was a large orange light which appeared to be hovering about 300 yards above the house. At first I thought it was a plane but it made no sound and did not move. It seemed to be just suspended in the air. After about 3 minutes it suddenly streaked away at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. I have never seen anything like this before and would appreciate any information you can give me on the subject.

Sincerely,
[redacted]

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers noted a bright white object that looked like it was on fire, since smoke was coming off of the object. The object seemed to come down very fast. One observer thought it might have been a glider, but they felt it was too fast and that it must have been a UFO. All observers agreed that it looked like a spinning round light. One witness said the object looked like a meteorball. All three observers are not sure what direction the object was heading, nor reports to the sky, enough.
From the information there is nothing present to indicate that the object was more than an airfoil.
