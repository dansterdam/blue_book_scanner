NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

  On 4 March 1949 at 1420 I spotted an object Northeast of
Watson Laboratories. I was standing in the west side of the
parking lot.

  To me this object appeared disc-shaped and traveling at
a very high rate of speed from Northeast to North. This ap-
peared to be a very bright or shiny look. It did not appear
to change shape while it changed its course.

After scanning the sky in the general direction pointed out I also saw an object travelling very rapidly across the sky. I do not have any idea of the physical size of the object, or at what rate of speed it was travelling. I kept the object in sight for about one minute, until it disappeared out of sight.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 4 March 1949, at approx. 1421 o'clock, I, along with [Redacted] of 313lst ASTRONOMICS Station, Watson Labors, all employes Red Bank, New Jersey, was about to enter Mr. Sliver's station's car which was parked in the west side of the main parking area, to ride out to Camp Woods in line of duty. Mr. [Redacted] suddenly drew our attention to something unusual in the sky. I didn't see anything at first, but a B-29 approaching from a general northerly direction, but after putting on my glasses, I soon saw what appeared to be metallic like disc or a non-luminous white or light aluminum color, well in back and to the west of the plane. Within a few seconds after I saw the object it made a half loop-like turn and headed North-west at a jet like rate of speed. Due to its shape it did not resemble anything that I had ever seen before in the sky, nor was there any apparent propulsion vapor or heat waves.

When seen, this object was so far away that it would be impossible to estimate its size and then again it was in sight for about a minute before it disappeared in the haze of the horizon.

I called it to the attention of the other fellows with me and they also saw it.

The object was moving rapidly to the left of the plane and, veering to the right, it disappeared into space. I had the impression that it was moving under its own power. The total time of observation was approximately one minute. We all agreed that it was different from anything we had ever seen in the sky before.

NOTE: Evans Signal Laboratory (U. S.

At the time, the prevailing wind was in a general Westerly direction.  This flight would be ll - 12 miles South of Watson Laboratories and the direction of the test balloon would be to the East.  The unidentified phenomena mentioned in this report was first seen coming from a NNE direction and disappearing in a NNW and was many miles North of this point of observation and it is remote that this phenomena was identified with the balloon flight mentioned above.

I called it to the attention of th other fellows with me and they saw it, too.

  The object was moving to the left of the plant and, wheeling to the right, it disappeared into space. I had the impression that it was moving under its own power. The total time of observat'on was approximately one minute. We all agreed that it was different from anything we had ever seen in the sky before.
