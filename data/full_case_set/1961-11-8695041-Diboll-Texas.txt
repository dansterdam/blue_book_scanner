On the night of November 1, 1961 at approximately 8 P.M. CST at my home in Diboll, Texas, I received a telephone call from a neighbor who observed a small lighted object in the sky. I went out to see the object, which appeared to me to be something like a satellite, but a flashing light on the object caught my attention. The object appeared to me to be the same as I had previously observed Echo on several occasions. The object suddenly disappeared after observing it several minutes. It did not observe any aircraft, though as the night was clear and numerous stars were in the sky, it was brighter than the stars. I did not observe any other lights, though as the observer stated the object was seen in connection with high flying aircraft.

It was originally thought to be a satellite, was seen in the western sky at an angle of 70 to 80 degrees. This was observed for several minutes traveling in a northerly direction and have been dismissed as a satellite, if when it was in the northern sky at an angle of 15 degrees, it suddenly disappeared at 8:05 P.M. CST and was not seen again.

The object could not be distinguished from a star of 2nd degree magnitude except by it's motion.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet with handwritten text providing details about an observed object on the evening of November 12, 1961 in Diboll, Texas.

The handwritten text reads:

On the evening of 12 Nov, 1961 at approximately 8:00 CST in Diboll, Texas, I observed from a house a bright light in the sky moving S.E. I looked overhead and noticed a slight reddish blue light at an angle of approx 70 degrees from the horizon in the NNW sky moving to the north. Occasionally it would stop and then proceed again. It was a large light and not a star like. I observed it moving steadily to the north. The light appeared to be constant with some flickering. It was higher than the trees across the street. I watched it for about 10 minutes before it disappeared. The light was not a plane or helicopter as I have observed them many times. The light appeared to be a UFO as I have never observed anything like it before.
