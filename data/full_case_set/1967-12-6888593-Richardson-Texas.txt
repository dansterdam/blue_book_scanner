Transcription of the text on the document:

At 8:30 p.m. central standard time on 22 December 1967, the writer was advised that a strange object was sighted in the sky over Richardson, Texas.

As the writer was unable to comply with the request as soon as he received it, he obtained a full report the following day.

According to the information gathered, the object in question was described as approximately 25 feet in length, with a bright red light at the rear. It was first seen by a maid who was taking out the trash at the apartment house where the report originated. The object was seen to approach from the northeast and pass directly over the apartment house at an estimated altitude of 300 feet.

The object was silent and apparently under intelligent control. As it passed over the apartment house, it banked sharply to the right, maintaining a constant speed throughout. The object then headed in a southerly direction and was lost from sight.

The witness reported that the object appeared to be metallic and reflecting light. The bright red light at the rear was constantly illuminated and there were no other lights visible.

It was estimated by the witness that the sighting lasted approximately 90 seconds. No sound was heard emanating from the object.

The writer has carefully checked this report and, as far as can be determined, the witness appears to be reliable and without any tendency to fabricate or embellish the incident. This report is submitted for whatever action or evaluation you may deem appropriate.

The sky was perfectly clear and the stars provided a good background for our sighting. The object was observed for 35 deg.

The only other airplane activity in the area was a small plane at high altitude (over 30,000 feet) which was descending. This plane was not considered to have any connection with the object observed.

The total time of the sighting was estimated to be 4 to 5 minutes.

At the end of this period, the object appeared to descend slightly, then accelerate rapidly and disappear.

We will be pleased to answer any further questions.

Yours truly,
