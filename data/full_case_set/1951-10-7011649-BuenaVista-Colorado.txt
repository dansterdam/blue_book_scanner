AF FORM 112 - PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED
ON 26 APRIL 1950 - 2330 HOURS, 20 OCTOBER 1951
APPROXIMATELY SEVEN (7) MILES SOUTH FROM BUENA VISTA, COLORADO, A STRANGE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED CROSSING THE TERRAIN FROM EAST TO WEST AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED. IT APPEARED TO BE CIGAR-SHAPED AND GLOWED WITH A BLUISH HAZE, GOING NORTH TO SOUTHWEST AND IN A DESCENDING CURVE. I WOULD ESTIMATE THE ANGLE TO BE APPROXIMATELY 30Â°.
THE OBJECT STAYED WITHIN MY SIGHT APPROXIMATELY 20 SECONDS - THE INITIAL LIGHT THAT ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION WAS BLUISH-GREEN IN COLOR AND VERY BRIGHT. AFTER THE LIGHT WAS DESCENDING, IT LIT UP THE ENTIRE SKY, BUT THE LIGHT WAS CONCENTRATED ON THE OBJECT ITSELF.
THE ONLY DEDUCTION I COULD DRAW FROM THE APPEARANCE WAS THAT THE OBJECT HAD CHANGED COLOR AS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE PARTICLES CHANGED.
WITH A VISIT TO THE SITE I NOTICED A VERY ACCURATE DIAGRAM OF THE DIRECTION THE LIGHT WAS TRAVELING. THE DIRECTION I GAVE PREVIOUSLY APPEARS TO BE NORTH RATHER THAN SOUTHWEST. THE TERRAIN IS SUCH THAT NO OTHER EXPLANATION CAN BE GIVEN AS TO THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT WAS TRAVELING.
