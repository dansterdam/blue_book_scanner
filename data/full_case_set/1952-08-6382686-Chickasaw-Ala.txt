17:33M, 28 AUGUST 1952, AT GP UNITED STATES ARMY,
CHICKASAW, ALABAMA

Reported in accordance with AR 200-9, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects. 
The witness, w C. UTIP, reported the sighting of a strange luminous object in the sky at 17:33M, 28 August 1952, over Chickasaw, Alabama. The object was described as being elliptical in shape, glowed from a fluorescent yellowish-white color, and appeared to be larger than a standard C-47 aircraft. It was apparently hovering and at times appeared to be moving rapidly at an undetermined speed. Several other witnesses also observed the object, which was first sighted in the southeast traveling in a northwesterly direction. It was observed for approximately 5 minutes and then suddenly disappeared from view. 
The object appeared as a blinking light, changing in color from white to red and back to white, and seemed to oscillate or pulsate. It was observed to slowly move northward and then suddenly accelerate and move in a rapid zig-zag pattern to the south and southwest, finally disappearing.
Only aircraft reports operating in the vicinity at the time of sighting was a F-84 jet performing a routine training mission in the area. There was no report as to the object finally disappearing.
Weather at 22000 feet/70000 mile high stratus clouds with winds from 120-14 knots. The altitude of the object was estimated to be between 10,000 - 12,000 feet.

31 AUG 1952
The following is a written statement concerning a strange sight observed by a military observer in the sky above Chickasaw, Alabama, on 31 Aug 52.
1. The following is a factual account of the incident as related by the observer:
2. At approximately 1155 hours on 31 Aug 52, I was standing outside a building facing west, when I observed an unusual object in the sky. It first appeared to be a solid silvery object, shaped like a cigar and moving at a very high rate of speed, approximately 150-200 feet above the ground. The object went into a steep climb and disappeared from sight. It was visible for approximately 15-20 seconds.
3. After the object disappeared, I immediately entered the building and reported the incident to the officer in charge. The officer in charge advised that he also observed the object, confirming my description.
4. In preparing this statement, I have again carefully reviewed the incident in my mind, and I am confident that my description of the object and its maneuvers are accurate. I am unable to offer any explanation as to the identity or origin of the object. I am in good physical condition, have normal eyesight, and am familiar with a wide variety of aircraft. This is the first and only time I have observed an object of this nature.

The image contains a typed document titled "STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN WILLIAM H. EDWARDS", dated 29 August 1952. The text describes the observation of an unidentified object by the witness, who was on a tour of duty at Brookley Air Force Base in Alabama. The object was observed through binoculars and appeared to be larger than a planet or bright star, and remained stationary for approximately 20 minutes before the witness advised the tower operators to continue observation. The document also mentions that the object had a small distinct white tip on the ground return at a distance of four (4) miles on a bearing of 230 degrees from Brookley while I was observing the object.

STATE!ENT OF 
CAPTAIN WILLIAM H. EDWARDS 
NO 53? 75
29 August 1952
The undersigned was on a tour of duty as Officer of the Day, Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama, from 0530, 28 August 1952 to 0530, 29 August 1952.
As approximately 2130, 28 August 1952, I received a telephone call from a Mr. ___ living in Chickasaw, Alabama. I alerted the Air Provost Marshal and the control tower operators, who in turn alerted the G.C.A. operators at Brookley Air Force Base.
I then proceeded to the tower to see if I could observe any objects in the area advised by Mr. ___ arriving in the tower at approximately 2150.
I was advised while in the tower that the G.C.A. agents were alerted to check the accuracy of the report.
The tower operator asked me to check an object he had observed with the binoculars in the tower. This time was approximately 2150. Looking with both the naked eye and through the glasses, the object appeared slightly larger than a planet or a bright star. This was approximately 20°above the horizon and at a distance of approximately 10° to 20° from the ground. This object remained stationary for approximately 20 minutes. I was called out and advised the tower operators to continue observation.
The G.C.A. advised the tower that they had a small distinct white blip in edge of the ground return at a distance of four (4) miles on a bearing of 230 degrees from Brookley while I was observing the object. This white blip was approximately the same relative bearing and distance as estimated by the undersigned.

STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN WILLIAM E. EDWARDS, AC 535 751 (Continued)
The illumination varied and changed from blueish green to a red, nearly the color of exhaust flames and glowing red of exhaust stacks as noted by persons familiar with aircraft flying at night.
My first impression was an aircraft approaching, however, G.C.A. could not observe any aircraft within its scope or any movement.
At the time of observation there was some cloud cover and the undersigned could not observe the Bates Field beacon which is approximately 11 miles distant.

STATUS REPORT OF 29 August 1952
1919th AACS Squadron Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama
I went on duty at the GCA trailer at 1900, 29 August 1952, and was to stay out there all night as a trailer guard radar operator. Sometime past nine the tower called and asked me to scan to the north and on a 360 degree angle. I turned on the radar locator of the AN/FPN-1 set to the north. There was nothing out there on the scope. I called the tower back and asked them what it was all about. They said to go ahead to stand watch on the 360 degree angle, that the officer of the day was up there, and to report anything at all that I saw on the scope. A little bit later I noticed a return, not of two distinct, but of one about four (4) miles on a bearing of 260 degrees. It did not move. When I called the tower and told them of this, they told me to continue watching it, which I did. I watched it about half an hour. The rest of the team (GCA Team) came out and we turned the new set, an AN/CPN-4, on to see if we could see anything. Nothing was visible above or through the ground clutter on the new set. As far as we could see, it did not move and did not get any more definite. None of us are very familiar with the AN/CPN-4 scope and couldn't notice any difference. I discontinued watching about 0030, 29 August 1952.

At 2330 on the night of 28 August 1952, my wife went to the back door to latch the screen. She called me and I went over to the door. In the south-southwest (220) degrees she seemed to have a bright glow or light near the horizon. There were clouds but clear atmosphere. The object was a fire-engine red, and shich told on and off, but remained quite stationary. It would wave back and forth and twice a couple of beeps and disappear and reappear on to the west, which is about a bright star or planet. We calculated it as between seven and ten miles away, almost directly over the pro-shop. It seemed a rather bright star. We did not make any noise. Later two smaller ones appeared almost together but this could be due to the moonlight. Finally the object seemed to disappear. We watched this in a southwest direction that appeared just over 8 hours ago but it didn't move in a constant motion. It would stay on a while and then go off and then come on again. It seemed bright to us and by the time it disappeared it was just a little glow. I then I went downstairs and went out the front porch. It was then I saw another object. It was not as bright as the first two but was also moving in a southerly direction. The one Mr. Robinson saw was in the west. The first two that we saw were almost directly overhead.

I made a statement that it looked like it was shining through the clouds, but the clouds seemed to be a little bit closer. Didn't see any other things in the sky except the two bright objects that appeared and then disappeared almost like going behind a cloud but it clouds didn't look black enough to hide an object that big.

I thought when I first saw them they were stars or planets. Then I realized that stars didn't do like that. I have seen them off and on. The 2 July 1952 the 24th my wife and I were going to go to the field before, but they would disappear.

STATEMENT OF 
MR. [REDACTED]

29 August 1952

I was at home on the evening of 29 August. At approximately 9:30 P.M., I was looking out a window at the sky which was clear. I first noticed what appeared to be a bright flashing light in the sky. I pointed this out to my wife, and we watched it for a few minutes. It was moving in a straight line. We then spotted two more, and a total of about six objects, all of which appeared to be traveling at a tremendous rate of speed. The objects appeared to be very bright, and looking at them appeared to be something like looking at the sun. One by one they disappeared from sight. At other times we have noticed these objects in the sky, and other times shoot clear across the horizon. While it is difficult to estimate their size, it appeared to be somewhat larger than a star, but smaller than a planet. Their speed appeared to be faster than any aircraft I have ever seen. I noticed one that seemed to be a more controlled flight, maneuvering, rather than just a straight flight across the horizon.

1919th AACS Squadron
Brockley Air Force Base, Alabama

29 August 1952

Control Tower Operator

I was working in Traffic answering calls when the officer of the day came around. He came to me and said that he had a report that an officer saw a light to the west of the field. This was at about 2100 hrs when it first became visible. I went out to the tower platform and then I saw a light in the distance. It was a bright white color. I looked at it for just a little while, only about three or four minutes, then it went out. I know nothing about it, radar, but at the same time we were in contact with GCI by radio. The GCI operators spotted something over to the northwest, heading east, at 8000 feet. I know that they reported three blips within 4,000 feet, none moving and did not say anything about the distance or what else happened. It was clear in the tower. I say no clouds interfering whatever. The object was towards the east of the moon. I never noticed the object move. The moon is sometimes dimming at about this time of night and that is when I saw this object, so I assume it was not the moon but some other object. I cannot identify this object and this report is exactly the same as the one there.

STATEMENT OF
T.A. WHITAKER
AF 14 235 045
CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR

29 August 1952

On the night of 21 August 1952, I was on duty as a control tower 
operator when the Officer of the Day came to the tower and requested me 
to make checks on an unidentified aerial object. The Officer of the Day 
stated that he had a report from Chickasaw of a flying saucer 
sighting. The Officer of the Day and myself went out to the UHF antenna 
tower and observed the object. We could clearly see it and it appeared 
to be a greenish-white light in the sky.

At this time the GCA operator reported that he had a blip on his scope 
on a bearing about 5 miles to the north and below the scope. The Officer 
of the Day requested me to take a look through the binoculars which were 
on the roof. The only remark I can make is that the object appeared to 
be the size of a T-33 jet going to Tawson Air Force Base. Alabama. The 
Officer of the Day called the Air Force base, but they could not confirm 
the sighting, although they were on the alert. The object then disappeared 
and I could find no trace of it on any other instruments. I cannot give any 
other details except the remarks concerning color.

29 August 1952

STATEMENT OF: _____, Mobile, Alabama

Last night at approximately 2200 hours, I saw four objects in the sky ranging from one point to the Chickasaw, Alabama. Two of these objects did not move yet were slightly larger and brighter than stars. One of these objects appeared in the form of a blurred light, one above the other, the top light being green and the bottom reddish. These objects remained stationary for about fifteen minutes and then this set of two blurred lights slowly changed to an alternately fiery red and blue-green in color and seemed to blink at regular intervals. This four object remained stationary for about fifteen minutes and then slowly drifted fifteen or twenty degrees and became stationary again. I left Chickasaw, Alabama, for Brookley Air Force Base at approximately 2220 and these objects were still in the same relative position as when I first observed them.

I heard no noise nor saw any exhaust from any of the above objects. From the distance of my observation of these objects, I found it difficult to obtain further identifying characteristics.

Statement of: Mrs.       Bass and Transient Aircraft Section

At approximately 2130, 28 August 1952, while riding west on Duvall Street between Morton Bridges and Flightline Avenue, I saw two lighted objects. At first they failed to attract too much of my attention because they appeared to be perhaps a couple of lights on tip and of a large type aircraft. The objects were stationary, as lights do appear on an aircraft proceeding in same direction. However, the lights appeared larger than those ordinarily used on way tips. For approximately two minutes I looked steadily at the objects until they disappeared approximately at the objects until they disappeared approximately at the same speed and direction as they appeared. The appearance was as a light only - no coloring. They did not appear either oval or circular with the flat side together, but closed. When the objects moved they moved simultaneously. I did not see any exhaust or hear any noise that could have come from the strange objects.

I was on duty on the night of 28 August 1952, as a control tower operator, when I was called about 2237 to put GCA in operation, as there was an object overhead which appeared to be moving at a terrific rate of speed. I turned on the GCA and observed the object on the radarscope. It was in an apparent erratic course and was in sight for approximately 2 minutes. I directed the object to be observed through the binoculars. I was using. The object appeared in one place and then in another. It is apparent that it moved at an extremely high rate of speed. Then it began getting dimmer and dimmer until it faded out completely.
The object was of such a nature that it did not reflect light any appreciable amount. It did not resemble any aircraft or meteor I have ever seen. It did not leave a trail of any kind and the only effect produced was a reddish glow around the edges, which faded out completely.

STATEMENT OF
MRS. C.A.
29 August 1952

As approached at 9:32 p.m. on the night of 29 August, I went to watch our brightest object which I saw in the southland low and seemed like the planet Venus. However, they called Me. C.A. to come and see what it was. We watched it a few minutes and then it went down. The object was very low and I could see bright lights on it. Then it came up again. It just drifted off to the south. Another object came in the south. We watched this one for quite a while. It seemed to hover and it just drifted out of sight. We then saw a third object which was dim and really couldn't tell the shape. They were dim and really couldn't tell the shape. They seemed higher. The first object was bright and the other four were dim. It this time a Mr. Robinson also came out and we could not tell just where the objects went. They first seemed higher then lower, then they were out of sight. We observed these objects for more than five minutes, but they didn't seem to change in appearance. The second object was higher in the sky than the first one.

I know these objects were real because I could see them clearly and they would change in color and then it would completely vanish. We could not return in sight again. The objects were in a relatively close position, which meant the top one and the bottom one were just about the same distance. We could not see behind them or see any wings.

The objects, to my mind, were real. Something like a star but still red and blue and you could tell it was moving. It lost altitude and then started the first object which lasted above five (5) minutes or a little longer. It then and I have seen these objects before but varied duration.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: (Military)
Intelligence Officer
Summary of Information
PLACE: Chickasaw, Alabama
SUBJECT: Unidentified flying objects were sighted near Petty's, Alabama. 
DETAILS: On July 24, 1952, two unidentified objects were sighted approximately 2,200 feet above the ground over the Petty's area near Chickasaw, Alabama. The objects were round and dark in color and appeared to be metallic. Their size was estimated to be about 20 feet in diameter. There were no definite characteristics of being able to determine size or shapes due to darkness and distance, however, the objects appeared to be rotating as they hovered over the horizon. Two bright lights, one on each object, were observed.
The objects were observed for a period of about 15 to 20 minutes. When their lights were turned out, the objects disappeared when their lights were suddenly extinguished as if with a switch.
One of the military officers who observed the objects stated that they could not be identified or observed by any aircraft flying in the area.
The weather report for the period is as follows: Sky clear, wind 5 mph, temperature 80°F. Visibility 15 miles.
These objects were not identified or observed by any aircraft flying in the area.

EST 28 August -3). This is the date and time of the sighting, which occurred at 0200Z 29 August 5'3.

The text describes the object as being mobile, since it moved steadily and rapidly in the same direction. The document mentions that the object was some distance away, and that it was not possible to judge its size accurately. The document also states that there was no noise associated with the object.

Overall, the document appears to be a detailed report of a UFO sighting, likely part of Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official study of unidentified flying objects.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text. The text appears to be a description of an event or observation related to a UFO sighting. The text mentions the time (2100 EST 28 August), the location (Chickasaw, Alabama), and various details about the observed object, including that it was "this is the sounding at Pona" and that it "traveled at Horizon Mobile--no noise together and above horizon with starting down".

The text in the document says:

"SUBJECT: UFO Sightings, Chickasaw, Alabama
The witness (name deleted) informed the writer that on the night of 25 August 1952, he observed an object in the sky. He reported the object to be about 50 feet in diameter, round in shape, and colored red and blue. He said the object seemed to be pulsating and was quite different from any aircraft he had ever seen. He did not observe the object to disappear.

A/2C Richard E. CALLIGAN, AF-132827l7, 1949 AACS Squadron, (Statement attached), was on duty on the night of 25 August 1952. He was asked to scan the north-easterly sky in an effort to locate the object described by the witness. He reported that he did not see any unusual lights in the sky.

A/2C Charles E. GOCTZ, AF-11231332, 1949 AACS Squadron, (Statement attached), was also on duty on the night of 25 August 1952. He was asked to scan the north-easterly sky, but reported that he did not see any unusual lights.

Capt. and Mrs. (names deleted) meeting of an unusual lights in the sky in Chickasaw, Alabama both reported on 9 August 1952 concerning a similar incident. The light was described as similar to the object described by the witness. The light was a matter of red and blue colors and was pulsating. It appeared for approximately one half to one hour. The pilot crew came out to turn on a landing set and did not observe the light. The coloring changed from red to blue. Mr. (name deleted) remarked that he saw one light.

On 11 August 1952, this information was also reported to ATIC that the officers did not observe any object on the night of 25 August 1952. No further reports."
