William M. Ross
SYNOPSIS: At 2325 hours, 22 August 1951, a flying object was detected on radar at Larson AFB, Washington. The object was tracked for several minutes and was observed to be traveling at an average speed of 945 miles per hour at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet. The object was not positively identified and the report indicates the object may have been a "PST", which appears to be some kind of unidentified object or phenomenon.

Please advise immediately whether weather conditions prevalent in your area at that time favor the phenomena of anomalous micro wave propagation which results in spurious target signals. Particularly, was there a temperature inversion and/or moisture variation with altitude; what was the approximate shape of radar target returns; are photographs of the target return available.

LARSON AFB, WASHINGTON - 26 AUGUST 1951

On 26 August 1951, at approximately 0205 hours, an AN/CPS-1 radar set picked up an unidentified object. The object was described as a source of "Al" (interference) on the radar scope, and was estimated to be at a range of 12,000 to 13,000 yards, and at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. The object was tracked for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, after which it disappeared. The conclusion was that the target was observed on only the low frequency end of the AN/CPS-1 radar set.

WEATHER CONDITIONS: At the time of sighting, the weather conditions were not favorable for anomalous propagation.

STATUS OF INVESTIGATION:
Review of this incident by the electronics section of ATIC concluded that the return was possibly due to interference, and it was concluded that the anomalous reflection was probably due to aircraft or other flying objects in the area at the time.

APPENDIX III

LARSON AFB, WASHINGTON - 26 AUGUST 1951

On 26 August 1951 at 0226 AST, an unidentified flying object was detected by an Air Force radar operator. The object moved at a speed estimated to be 900 to 1,000 mph. The object was observed on radar for approximately 5 to 6 minutes.

The F-86 aircraft were scrambled but radar contact with the object was lost. The object was first tracked between 17,000 to 20,000 feet with a rapid descent to 15,000 feet.

The operator of the radar set, an Air Force Captain, is considered to be an expert operator.

Weather conditions at the time of sighting were not favorable for anomalous microwave propagation.

Status of Investigation:
Review of this incident by the Electronics Division of ATIC concludes that the return was positive, meaning that the object was real. This conclusion is based on the precision of the radar tracking and the fact that the target was observed on only the low beam of the APS-31 radar set.
