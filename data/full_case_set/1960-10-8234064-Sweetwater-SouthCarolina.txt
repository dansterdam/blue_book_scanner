The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a typewritten document with text that describes an unidentified flying object (UFO) incident.

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document, the output is as follows:

"On 9 Sepumber 1960 at 9:15 PM, an observer reported seeing a large orange object in the sky near Sweetwater. South Carolina. The object was described as 'spherical or circular' in shape and 'very bright' giving off an orange glow. It appeared to be about 'the size of a car' and was observed for about one minute before it disappeared behind some trees.

Observer estimated the object to be at an altitude of about 1500 feet and the estimated distance from the observer was about 1 mile. The object moved in a southerly direction at a slow rate of speed and was visible for approximately one minute before disappearing from view behind some trees.

The observer had no explanation for what was observed and stated that it was unlike any aircraft he had ever seen before. The report was investigated and the investigator could find no evidence to indicate that this was anything other than an unidentified flying object."

WITNESS STATEMENT

- page 21 -

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It seems to be a scanned page from an old document, possibly a Project Blue Book report, that contains only text.

Transcribing the text:

"First was too frightened to go out and see what it was. She told her sister, who came out to the house and also saw the object. They both watched it for about 15 minutes, and it appeared to be round or oval shaped, and emitted a bright white light. It did not move from its position in the sky, except for apparently tilting or swaying slightly. After about 15 minutes, it disappeared suddenly, going straight up out of sight. 

Although a thorough investigation was made, no supporting evidence was found to substantiate the sighting. No other witnesses were located and no physical evidence was discovered. The object was not picked up on radar at the time, and no corroborating reports were received from other sources. The Air Force evaluation is that the sighting was probably a hoax or imaginative report.

It is the opinion of the investigating officer that the physical evidence was not sufficient to warrant any conclusion regarding the origin or nature of the aerial object. The statement of the witness and her sister was taken, but there was no physical evidence to support their report. Consequently, the case is considered unresolved and of an unknown nature."
