Dear Sir:

On Sunday, 9 August, 1964, while trawelling north on U.S. Highway 99 just north of Selma, California, my sister called my attention to an object hovering in the sky. It appeared to be at about 10,000 feet. The object was cylindrical in shape, definitely metallic, and seemed to be rotating as I observed it for about 10 minutes. There was no visible means of propulsion. The object appeared about twice the size of a B-52 bomber.

I thought about the object and its strange characteristics. It was a while and cylindrical, and continued to be hovering, and appeared to be rotate as I observed it.

Your truly,
Signature

UFO SIGHTING REPORT

Date: Friday, 9 August, 1968
Time: 2050 (8:50 PM) (PST)
Location at time of sighting: Continuing lane, highway 99, along side of Union Company plant (from 1/2 mile), Selma, California.

Duration of sighting: Twenty (20) seconds.
The object was observed for a minimum of 20 seconds, possibly continuing slightly longer.

Size condition: Bright (brilliant)
Size location: In back of 200 (east)
Power condition: Close-in until disappeared, in the right hand only
Appearance of object: Sharply outlined

The object suddenly grew up and rushed away. 
The object appeared to be a very bright light, larger than an automobile headlight at any time. The object did not move in a straight line but rather in a definite zig-zag course at a very rapid rate.
The object made no sound that I could hear (being so distant).
The object was presummedly moving in my general direction, but I am sorry I cannot estimate the object's speed. Assuming it was not too distant, the speed must have been phenomenal.

I'm sorry I cannot estimate the object's speed. Assuming it was not too distant, the speed must have been phenomenal.
The sighting ended as the object disappeared or was obscured by the darkness. There was no more than 20 seconds elapsed during the entire sighting.
