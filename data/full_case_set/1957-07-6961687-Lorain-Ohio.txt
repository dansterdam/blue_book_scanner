There is no photograph present in this document. The document appears to be a typed text describing an observation made by the Ground Observer Corps in Sagiwaw, Michigan on July 6, 1957.

The text reads:

GROUND OBSERVER CORP 
FILTER CENTER
SAGIWAW, MICH.

GENTLEMEN:

ON THE ADVISE OF MR. WEBER, ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR CORP IN THIS CITY, I AM REPORTING THE UNUSAL OBJECTS OBSERVED AT 5:15 A.M. TODAY BY MY HUSBAND, 24 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND MYSELF.

OUR HOME IS SITUATED ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF EAST ERIE AVENUE WHICH PARALLELS LAKE ERIE. OUR DAUGHTER HAPPENED TO LOOK OUT TOWARD LAKE ERIE. SHE THEN OBSERVED THREE BRILLLIANT STARS IN THE NORTHEAST. SHE THEN DECIDED THEY WERE NOT STARS FOR CONTINUED OBSERVATION REVEALED THEM TO BE MOVING. THE FOUR POPPED INTO VIEW FROM BEHIND A ROW OF TREES ON THE OUTER SHORE OF THE LAKE. THEY TRAVELED IN A STRAIGHT LINE MAINTAINING THEIR RELATIVE POSITIONS TO EACH OTHER. THEY SEEMED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND TRAVELED AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED. WE WATCHED THEM UNTIL THEY PASSED OVER OUR HOME HEADING SOUTH. 

AN ACCURATE TIME CHECK COULD BE MADE FOR A PLANE FROM CLEVELAND HOPKINS AIRPORT WAS PASSING OVER OUR HOUSE HEADS NORTHBOUND.

WHAT DID WE SEE? FOUR DAZZLING WHITE LIGHTS, EXCEEDINGLY HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH'S SURFACE, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL AND TRAVELING IN THE FOLLOWING POSITION.

BECAUSE WE ARE IN BUSINESS HERE AND ALSO BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH HER WHO I CALLED OUR LOCAL PAPER TO ENQUIRE WHOM HUE CONCERNED FOR DOING SO PUBLICITY SEEKERS. SHE HAD SENT THIS LETTER TO US BUT WE HAVE DECIDED TO IGNORE IT AS IT WAS TOO MUCH ABOUT ,O.X. PUBLICITY SEEKERS. SHE MUST HAVE BEEN SO MANY KINDS IN OUR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON IS SURE THEY WERE "PLAYING SAUCERS" AND JOSPEHINE (SILL ?) LAND IN OUR FRONT YARD NEXT TRIP OUT.
I WILL GREATLY APPRECIATE HEARING FROM YOU.

SINCERELY,

[REDACTED]
LORAIN, OHIO
