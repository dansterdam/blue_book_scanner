The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten letter on the letterhead of "Howard Bond" addressed to "Dear Sirs". The letter describes the author's observation of a UFO flying over Berks County, Pennsylvania on a particular night. The author mentions seeing the UFO from their balcony and describes its movements and characteristics.

Here is the text of the letter transcribed:

Dear Sirs,
I am out on the balcony where I saw the U.F.O. According to the neighbors, I am facing North (9'9" facing the same spot that I saw the U.F.O.) As we (my mother & I) glanced over, the starry sky we noticed directly over head (a bit to the left of the star) the moving U.F.O. It kept going east as until it got out of sight. May I also tell you direct several hundred people saw this same U.F.O. The same night all over Berks County.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Gentlemen:
I wanted to inform you about the report I made on July 9th, 1967. This report was made to see if the cause of the disturbing night was investigated further. The incident occurred last night and I was quite frightened and bewildered by the event. This occurred at about 10:30 pm, my time. I had just returned home from my factory job and was preparing for bed. As I looked out the window, I saw a large bright light appear outside. My first impression was that it was a plane or helicopter, but as I watched closer, I saw that it was neither. It was hovering about 150 to 200 feet above the ground and was quite bright. The light was so bright it almost seemed to illuminate the area around it. All of a sudden, the light began to move. It moved very fast and close and I was terrified. I literally could not move or speak. The light then shot upwards at an extremely fast rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The whole incident lasted about 30 seconds. I wanted to report this to you again in the hope that my account may provide some additional information that could be useful in your investigations. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
Sincerely,
[Signature]

"Forest city area. South. 32 year 
Mr. Wright under the other man.
The report on what was observed is most credible, but it cannot be told very much about the sighting, as we have about 5 minutes. Now - I am sure this is to make a complete report with you, very shortly. I am writing to ask you what can be done? If you will use discretion on this matter, please, as I am trusting to cover up this entire matter. AND PLEASE DON'T say it was a plasma or something or such formulation, PLEASE DONT say anything so stupid! All this stuff is true, remember I told you in what all this is about? UFOs are real, they are crazy. Personally, I think they are probably smarter than we usually possibly guess. Thank you for reading this, as I must restrict this, as you readily know."

The image does not contain any photographs, only diagrams and text. The diagrams appear to be related to tracking or observing the motion of unidentified objects in the sky.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "B" on the compass show how you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.
