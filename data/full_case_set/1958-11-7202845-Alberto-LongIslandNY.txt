CONTACT REPORT: UFO SIGHTING OVER LONG ISLAND. NY. - 3 NOVEMBER 1958

THE FOLLOWING REPORT WAS SUBMITTED BY ALBERTO FROM LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK. AT ABOUT 8:30 P.M. ON 3 NOVEMBER 1958, HE OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT HOVERING OVER HIS BACKYARD FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES. ALBERTO DESCRIBED IT AS A LARGE, DISK-SHAPED CRAFT EMITTING A BRIGHT YELLOWISH-WHITE GLOW. HE STATED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE 30-40 FEET IN DIAMETER AND WAS HOVERING ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. THE OBJECT THEN ACCELERATED RAPIDLY AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. ALBERTO REPORTED THAT HE WAS SOMEWHAT SHAKEN BY THE EXPERIENCE AND WAS UNSURE OF WHAT HE HAD WITNESSED. HE EMPHASIZES THAT HE HAS NO EXPLANATION FOR WHAT HE SAW THAT EVENING AND IS UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR IT IN ANY WAY. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS RECOMMENDED.

CASE NUMBER: 23326.
