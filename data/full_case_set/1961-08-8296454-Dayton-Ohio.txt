The image contains three hand-drawn sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with a series of ray-like shapes radiating from it, as described in the instructions. The second and third sketches appear to depict landscape scenes, with a person standing in the road in the larger sketch and a mountainous landscape in the smaller sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The text in the document is as follows:

COMMANDER
Wright Patterson AFB, OHIO
Dear Sir:
May I pardon this intrusion upon your time, as goodness knows, you are probably a very busy man. But I must write to you and to friends witnessed a phenomenon which I cannot explain, or call the CD at the base, he too called the Object, it was called the Object Blu, which I had a good view of, about 130 ft. in diameter, low in the sky, in the Naval Air Corp, and was the first to hold tongue in cheeks, in reading of strange sightings reported by different observers the last few months, of this or prankish letters.
At 10:30 sharp nite, after viewing our Echo Satellite, and were in the back yard talking, my wife noticed a red lite coming from a Southerly direction, in immediately materialized about 30-40 feet above the tree tops over our house, the sky in a Northern direction, and about 3 or 4 times the size of a U.S. quarter. The object remained stationery for several seconds, then moved silently across the sky in a Northerly direction. If it was as high as the Echo Satellite, then I'd must have been going at the tremendous speed, and shortly across the sky. The object appeared to be as large, or larger than a U-2 plane, which I understand, has a ceiling of around 70,000 ft.
Could understand if the red lite was blinking off and one it would have indicated an intricate maneuvering, or a control of light rays, however, this was not the case, as the red lite remained constant. I assumed that even if it were a plane of the U-2 type, which some no doubt could assume, those could not travel at such tremendous air pressure, and be at stationary for any length of time as was this object, as no sound at all.
It moved across the sky approximately 3 to 4 seconds, and was absolutely no sound at all. It moved across the sky at a tremendous rate of speed.
I did not intend to over-whelm you with a lengthy letter, but would appreciate an answer when you have time.

Very truly yours,
[Signature]
Dayton 29, Ohio

This page from the Project Blue Book document contains two illustrations, but no photographs.

The first illustration shows a sketched diagram with a curved line and several markings. It appears to be demonstrating how an object was observed above the horizon (skyline) when the witness first saw it.

The second illustration contains two sketched scenes. The larger one shows a road or path leading towards a town or village, with a person walking on the path. The smaller inset sketch depicts a rounded landform or hill in the distance.

As requested, here is the text transcribed from the page:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
5. PHOTOS: 0 Yes
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 min
7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
8. COURSE: Straight & Level
9. COMMENTS: Most logical conclusion as to identity of object is that it was a high altitude Wind and had the c/s on which is only evident when the c/s are at high altitudes. Wind and or sound. Due to changing angle of observation and increasing distance, light could appear to snap out. Probably a/c.

The conclusions section indicates that the object observed was likely a high-altitude aircraft or wind, rather than an unidentified flying object.
