The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image shows a form with various questions about the observed object, including whether it disappeared while being watched, whether it moved behind or in front of something, and a description of the object's sound and color. The witness also provided a sketched description of the object's shape and movement. I will now proceed to extract all the text found in the document, excluding any references to or descriptions of the human witness.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes No Don't Know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Unusual, colored light, buzzer
b. Color: Orange to red

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
BETTER THEN ONE HALF

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

This object had a shape and was no more than 300 yards away and it moved in a straight line very slowly and silently from directly overhead in a southerly direction.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram with illustrations and instructions. The diagram shows a curved line labeled "A" and another curved line labeled "B", along with a compass rose. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine themselves at the point shown, and place marks on the diagram to indicate the object's position relative to the horizon and compass.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

AS TO THE HEIGHT IN THE SKY. These 3 boy- were to the east of me along the side of the road watching the thing and as far as I could gauge it, it was pretty well up in the sky, so I said that they were pointing up in the sky so I said "that's what they are looking about and just as I was about to get out, the car I looked up-nearly straight up-it was still going in this direction, pretty high up, and it seemed to be headed north, back where I was coming from. I couldn't say for sure how high it was but I would judge it to be still going at an altitude of certainly as much as 2 to 3000 feet and the way it was going, I would say that as far as we could tell. it seemed to be headed north.

April 10, 1967
Project Blue Book
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Gentlemen:

Because of the article which appeared in the April 1967 issue of MINUTES, a magazine published by Nationwide Insurance Company of Columbus, Ohio, I am going to relate as well as I can the sighting of a UFO.

The incident took place on the afternoon of March 26, 1967 about 4 P.M. on County Road 294 near the southern border of Crawford County between the small town of New Winchester and County Road 100. We were driving East and saw a car with three youths in it, age about 18 to 20 years old, stopped and they were looking at something in the sky. Curiosity made me look out my window and I saw something, too, so I pulled am down the road a little ways and stopped, got out of the car and looked in the sky.

The UFO or whatever it was, crossed over this road we were on going from S.E. to N.W. There was bright sunshining and it reflected on the object which was made of metal and was not the color of aluminum like airplanes, but I would say was the color of either brass or copper. While the object was miles high, from the road as it looked to be oval in shape and about 2-1/2 ft. long from the distance we were from it. Of course, it probably was much larger, but at the distance we stood from it that was the size to us. What powered the object we do not know, but we heard no sound like you might hear from an airplane motor. I would say it was about 3 miles high as near as I could judge. It moved at about airplane speed.

The three boys in the car came on down the road and parked beside my car and we were all out watching it and then traffic came from the opposite direction and we both had to move. I do not know who the youths were, but were evidently local boys. A man, Mr. L a retired policeman of Galion, Ohio, who is about 75, but very alert and he could see the object and described it the same as I saw it. None of the five had any explanation, but all saw it very plainly.

If there is any further information I can give you, or any other help, feel free to contact me at the above address.

Yours very truly,
[Signature]
