STATEMENT OF LOUIS ROACH

The incident occurred about 2:53 A.M. Jack went to the radar on the various ranges and various degree of antenna tilt. I don't remember what range I finally lost the radar on when I looked up, scanned the instruments, and looked outside and noted her other light it approached. There was an enormous scattering of isolated clouds which were very below us; we were at 17,000 and I'd estimate the tops of the scattered clouds were at 4-5,000 feet. It seemed I had looked back at the instruments when I had the sensation it was suddenly becoming light. It seemed that in a fraction of a second (about the time it would take a match to flare to its full brilliance after being struck) it was so bright I had the impression a searchlight was being directed at the aircraft (it was bright enough I could have easily found a book in the cockpit by its light). The thought that immediately entered my mind was that of missing our ETA at the P-ADIZ and that an interceptor aircraft had fired a flare or turned a searchlight on us. I looked out the right hand cockpit window and saw a bright ball of light about 10 degrees above and behind the aircraft. The object fell below and behind the aircraft. The object fell below and behind the aircraft. After the main ball of light went out there appeared to be three fragments which fell separately, glowing for perhaps two seconds. The color was a white phosphoric and there was no apparent forced or jet movement in relation to the aircraft. There was no apparent shock or noise accompanying the incident and I would estimate that it was about 12 seconds from the time I first saw it more over of the incident.

Statement of LCdr Roach (cont'd)
increase of light until the last fragments went out. I could see no other objects on either side of the aircraft or in any area which I could see.
I called for the Aircraft Commander, LCdr Harrell, who was back in the passenger cabin at the time; however, there was some delay in his being notified and it was about 15 or 20 minutes before he came forward and said that the CIRVIS report which was sent to Guam as we were not in contact with Clark when the report was ready. LCdr Harrell also passed the information on to Pan American Flight 25 Victor which was enroute to Manila and asked him to pass it to Clark by phone as soon as he got in.
