TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

PAGE 4 FINAL 30 UNCLAS

LT, CARRET CRAIGP.NT AVAILABLE - WINNC~IUCCA, NEVADA.
UFO SIGHTED NEAR TONOPAH, NFVADA. LIGHT CIRCULAR OBJECT OBSERVED TO POUR DEGREES ELEVATION ANGLE MOVING EAST TO WEST CROSSING PICTURE PLANE FOUR DEGREES TO MINUS 30 DEGREES OF ELEVATION IN 1-SECOND. OBJECT WAS ILLUMINATED AND APPEARED 4-5 TIMES BRIGHTER THAN SURROUNDING NIGHT-SKY ACCORDING TO WITNESS.
1 - 25/1200 FEET; 41 52O - 35.000 FEET MINUS 50 DEGREES OF ELEVATION TO MINUS
25 DEGREES PLUS: 40-50 SECONDS.
JUPITER - THIS PLANET CURRENTLY RISES ON THE EASTERN HORIZON AND IS APPROACHING MAXIMUM HEIGHT IN THE SOUTHERN SKY. THE LIGHT OBSERVED WAS PROBABLY FROM THIS STAR-LIKE SATELLITE. A SATELLITE WAS OBSERVED PASSING OVER THIS AREA AT AN
ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 300 MILES.
A FLIGHT OF FOUR NAVY F-4B'S WERE OPERATING IN THE AREA AT ALTITUDES UP TO 35,000 FEET. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED TO APPARENTLY PASS BETWEEN THE FOUR F-4B'S. WITNESS STATED THAT HE OBSERVED AND FOLLOWED THE OBJECT VISUALLY UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED.

POST - 2 - 15M (1154) THE UNCLAS AIRCRAFT RETURNED TO THE FIELD. THE LEAD AIRCRAFT PILOT REPORTED THAT A SHORT TIME AFTER A SIGHT OF A "FLASH" AND THAT THEY
SIGHTED A CIRCULAR LIGHT WHICH WAS BRIGHTER THAN VENUS, AND ALSO RETURNED THROUGH THE SAME AREA OF THE SKY. IT WAS POINTED OUT TO THEM THAT THEIR OBSERVATION COINCIDED WITH THE VISUAL SIGHTING OF THE VFO BY THE GROUND OB-
SERVER WHO NOTIFIED THEM BY RADIO.

THE AREA AT WHICH THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE IS MOUNTAINOUS AND INFORMATION CONTAINED FROM THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA, ONGIVE SOME REPORT OF THIS SIGHTING, DO NOT COMPLETELY SUBSTANTIATE THE FACT THAT THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS A SATELLITE. THE MOTION AND THE TIMING OF THE OBJECT ARE NOT CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF A SATELLITE. MOTION OF SATELLITE, ACCORDING TO TWO WITNESSES, INDICATE THAT IT WAS NOT A SATELLITE. IN THE OPINION OF THE INVESTIGATING OFFICERS, THAT THE OBJECTS OBSERVED
WAS SOMETHING OTHER THAN A SATELLITE.
