The record card contains various fields such as the date, location, time, type of observation, source, number of objects, length of observation, and a brief summary of the sighting.

assurred the reporter of my story and he later stated that he thought the contents of the story would be in the Sunday, May 4th issue. However, for some unknown reason it never appeared.

I have no personal desire to give publicity in print but I believe it is about the that the authorities, as well as the citizens, be openly informed of a dramatic happening as important as this instance. I firmly believe that this saucer was making a normal landing.  while over the scene and if my report has been builded scientifically, we would be in a more investigant position to know more clearly what occurred. 

I contacted you with the request to the Army that "someone was slopping at the switch", or if it is being kept "hush, hush", that the public reaction will be make contact with us (as has been proven in the past) experience has taught us that unidentification toward events to cause a lapse of phenomena. and scope with what has been.

Misted here are the names and addresses of witnesses mentioned above.  I can also present an article from the Birmingham Economic, that the police furnished the newspaper edition concerning my reports to them stating "that could the police do if we had intruders from the sky". This proves that the Air Force officers are not briefed as short to the possibility of future events.

Gentlemen:

I have been a faithful believer and follower of Flying Saucer incidents as far back as 1949 and was of the opinion that they were a project of the U.S. Government, until recently when I received a report which I am going into in detail.

Coincidently, I happened to read the April 7th issue of Life Magazine which precedes my experience by a couple of weeks, explaining my actions.

I live approximately seven miles west of Birmingham, Michigan which is north of Detroit about fifteen miles. On Sunday night, April 27th, my wife, two children and myself were proceeding home from my sister's residence on Strathmore when I noticed Lt. Col. D. D. Acres on Fifteen Mile Road (Fifteen mile Road runs through Birmingham east and west and this point is about six miles west of Birmingham) my wife and I jokingly remarked that we must be seeing things, and I noticed a strange looking object in the sky approximately one thousand feet high. This object seemed to be heading in a south west direction from the northeast. It descended so fast that by the time my wife could realize what it was a solid lighted object it had descended to a height of approximately 2,000 feet or the average height of a transport plane at that time. It seemed to hover perfectly still and then apparently took in such tremendous light and speed that in approximately four minutes making it very easy for us to judge its size, shape, etc. We estimated it to be approximately 5,000 feet high. The angle at which it rested made it very easy for us to estimate its thickness. It appeared to be approximately ten feet high which resembled looking into the playing section of a mouth organ. The windows were all around the entire diameter. I would estimate its diameter to be in the neighborhood of one hundred feet.

After what seemed to me they were getting their bearings, they started drifting northeast towards the city of Pontiac at about one hundred miles per hour but stopped two or three times during the time of our observation.

At no time did it make a noise.

Immediately I realized that I should have witnesses to this phenomenon, so I ground to halt on Highway and waved to the woman following my car to stop. I then persuaded two other cars to stop and I obtained witness to my experience. After persuasion, two of them went out and were unable to see anything at least five miles northwest. At this point I called the Birmingham police and asked them if they had any information about a strange phenomenon which they said they would do. I returned to my car and we continued to follow it going northwest. Its direction was then directly in line with the direction which they said they would do.

I returned to say Selfridge Field and during the most five minutes the third lights changed from white to a brilliant yellow orange and by this time we had passed the ground which I believe had caused the strange phenomenon. Thinking this experience would make a good newspaper story, I discussed it with a Detroit Times reporter. I telephoned the newspaper and told them my story thus far.

After that I again called the Birmingham police and asked them if they had reported the incident as yet. They said they were thinking about it the same ground and said I would call Montgomery Field, which I did. If anyone ever got the "brush", I am sure I did. I was transferred to five different departments and finally, before I could get some officer who, I am sure, was awakened by my call and was very peevish, asked me bluntly if I wanted to make an official complaint. I told him no, I just wanted a close-up view of a giant saucer; I got some planes in the sky at Selfridge, but this was not the apparatus of the saucer. Then he repeated, "Well, I can do is report it, but." Then he hung up.

During my investigation, I conversed with the VAC had witnessed the spectacle and railroad express truck driver to observe the spectacle. I learned that if traveled through Birmingham and out about seven miles due west following the Selma road, it vanished from view over the trees toward the general direction of Pine at 11:15 P. M. (8:5 hours)

I contacted the director of Selfridge Field and gave them this story. Their reporter phoned Selfridge Field and the Radar Division and they both told him that this was not picked up by Radar, so naturally, the time division dropped the inquiry.

To prove my story, I started to trace down my witnesses. After considerable difficulty I found the woman I had waved to stop and obtained written statements from each. Then I contacted the truck driver and he was willing to write a statement of his observation, (their names and addresses are at the end of this letter.) I again went to the Times with my group and the editor turned the story over to another reporter who again phoned Selfridge Field. This time they contacted the Intelligence Division. They natural said they had no information from people who had also sighted the Saucer at different points. This is all I have to report.
