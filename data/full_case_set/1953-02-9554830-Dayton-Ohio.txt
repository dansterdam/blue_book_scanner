UFO SIGHTING
Sighted as far as (illegible) the peak of a (illegible) it appeared very suddenly. The shape appeared to be triangular in form and smaller than an airplane, estimated 100 feet in width. The color appeared to be dark metallic, and it made no sound as it traveled, changing direction from north to south in approximately 3 seconds. The sighting lasted less than 10 seconds. I immediately called my wife and son into the room in an attempt to corroborate my observation, but it had already disappeared. The object was traveling at a very high rate of speed, considerably faster than any aircraft I have ever seen, and made no sound. There was a possibility that its appearance was due to some atmospheric condition, but I was unable to confirm that. 

Feb. 9, 1953 - Friday morning - clear sky.
I was sitting at my kitchen table reading a newspaper when the object appeared. It flew over my house traveling south to north. The entire observation time was approximately 6-10 seconds.

* (Approximately) 4 feet away from my view.

The text in the document states:

On February 4, 1953, at 4:30 a.m. a blinking light was observed in the sky. The light appeared slowly from the horizon and remained stationary for some time, then suddenly started to move rapidly in the sky. The light was of large size and gave off an unusually bright light. It was watched until 4:42 a.m. when it disappeared.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 
FROM (OWMER) PAGE OF PAGES 
Statement by

At approximately 1740 hours, 24 February 1953, my wife and I left the apartment at 1403 East Chaffin St., Sherman, Texas, to go to the theater. While driving along 7th St. in Sherman, I suddenly noticed an object in the sky which appeared to be a star, only it was moving. I pointed this out to my wife and we both observed what appeared to be a bright light in the sky. It seemed to be at a high altitude and we watched as it moved across the sky, gradually disappearing from view. After calling Intelligence, I had my wife sit down and write out the attached drawing. I had the impression that the object asked or signaled in some way, as if it was aware of our observation. I asked my wife if she considered the object to be "only a star", and she stated emphatically that it was not a star, but rather some type of aerial vehicle, definitely not an aircraft, meteor, or star. The object appeared to be moving at a very high rate of speed and did not follow the normal path of a meteor or aircraft. The total time of observation was 3 minutes.

reached a southeast pointing of observation. Objects were found in shape with metallic color. There was a tail of light behind the object and was a light source or object of some sort within the body of the object. The object remained inconsistently 30 and there were no other lights or solids moving in the area.
(2) The two objects were sighted at 1943 hours, Central Standard Time. January 1953 and were observed for 5 to 7 seconds.
(3) Observation was visual from two persons on the ground.
(4) Location of observers was 33° 38'N, 95° 37'W in Sherman, Texas; objects were about 2 degrees above horizon and observed from a predetermined altitude.
(5) The two observers have not previously experienced the observation of an unidentified object but Warrant Officer
's consideration as reliable.
(6) There was an overcast at 1400 feet with calm winds at time of sighting.
(7) There was no known condition, meteorological or otherwise, which would have accounted for the sighting.
(8) There is no known existence or evidence such as fragments, photographs or like of the sighting.
(9) When the sighting was made, the two observers telephoned Intelligence Personnel at Perrin APB. The time to the brief period of observation, not in excess of seven seconds, no action towards an intercept was possible.
(10) An inquiry at nearby Perrin APB, Tex revealed that no similar sightings were known to the authorities from this location at this time.

Observation of MRS. [REDACTED]

We went outdoors. We were going to a show. The time was twenty minutes to 8:00 p.m. Our husband went to the garage. We walked the dog. We had a light dinner and came back in the house. At 8 o'clock, we went out in the sky, unusually visible, through the thick overcast sky. The object did not appear like a star. It seemed to be near. We called our husband to come and see. He observed it too. It seemed to be maneuvering, rapidly, and then it disappeared. But she claimed: Just as suddenly as it came, it vanished and disappeared.

23 MARCH 1953

Dear Dr. Hynek:

We have been receiving your reports and evaluations on the 17-7-53 case, and we have been studying them very carefully. We have been evaluating the significance of this case in the light of what has been revealeed to us from other sources. This case appears to be one of the more puzzling that has been referred to us.

We estimate that about 23 or 24 persons, on 17 February, saw what appeared to be a cylindrical object with definite wings or stabilizing surfaces on each side of the body, and which gave off an intense glow, bright enough to read by, as it passed over the area in central Ohio. March reported can be substantiated to this extent.

As far as follow-up on the Valiant's sightings are concerned:

(1) Port Austin, 17 January - Continuation visual and radar - Have asked information on for evaluation. Definite airborne object visual and radar contact. Not identified by same object. The physical details and the visual at follow-up are recorded. The object involved gave our Indianapolis Data Sheet a good shaking and caused quite a discussion and speculation on the object's identity and destination. HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE a positive identification UP TO THE PRESENT DAY.

(2) The Skyraiders at Venice, California, on 27 February. Evidence - film. Current information indicates this film is consistent with a valid sighting and has beed analyzed for technical information. No identification as yet.

Concerning Dr. Hynek's proposed contract: we don't buy it either in its present form. I would like to confer with you and talk about this over-expanded contract. I feel we should rewrite it considerably, bringing it more in line with a reasonable approach to the problem. As a matter of fact, the tone of the contract is quite alarmist, and I think it gives the wrong impression. I believe we must continue to approach this problem realistically and avoid anything which would tend to create the impression that we are doing an all-out campaign to seek the involvment of the Intelligence Services (Army, Navy, Air Force). This would be a grave error and cause great complications to a matter which is not quite ready for that type of approach. I am sure you will agree with me on this.

I will telephone you in the very near future on this and other matters. Please feel free to call me at your convenience.

Sincerely yours,

A civilian woman contacted ATIC concerning a yellowish-white object which she had observed at a low altitude for two successive days for periods ranging from 5 to 10 minutes. The object was described as oblong shaped and very low hovering with the horizon. She observed the object through the window and it was visible due to a due to position at that time.

The image contains three sketches. The first sketch is a curved line with the instructions to imagine that you are at the point shown, and to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it.

The second and third sketches are larger sketches that appear to depict a road or highway with scenery in the background. The instructions indicate that the larger sketch shows the position of the object when it was first seen (marked with an "A") and when it was last seen (marked with a "B").
