GLOBAL SIGHTINGS
SAT DIEGO, CALIF.--The San Diego Union-Tribune carried an article entitled: "Flash in the Sky" a Satellite?"
Several hundred persons in San Diego, and as far east as El Paso, Texas, saw a satellite flash and lights in the sky. Fort Hancock, Texas and other places reported similar sightings. The U.S. Strategic Air Command stated that its IRBM (ICBM) reported a bright flash, but whatever it was began to tumble, and the color changed from brilliant white to orange and red. It was suggested that it might have been the routine launch of a satellite, but would not discount the possibility of an allied satellite being launched. The sighting occurred at about 7:35 P.M. (PDT) and the color that would account for the change of color after the flash was reported.

Newcasde upon Tyne
(Flying Disc)
29th June 1953
Mr. Edward Boyes, 17, Albion Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, reported to the Local Police that on the night of the 29th June, 1953, whilst walking home from the bus terminus at approx 10.20 p.m., he observed a disc-shaped object in the sky. 
The object was silvery-white in colour and appeared to be Illuminated from within. It was spinning and reversing in direction and at times seemed to be at a standstill. 
After watching the object for approx. 5 mins., it suddenly shot up into the sky at very high speed and disappeared from sight. 
Mr. Boyes states that the object was about 40 ft. in diameter and was at an estimated height of about 3000 ft. 
He further states that the object was making a humming noise which was audible for about 2 mins. until it shot up into the sky. 
Mr. Boyes reported the matter to the local Police who in turn notified the appropriate authorities.

Transcribing the text:

On the 30th of April, a dispatch out of Canberra said that a sphere had "definitely been identified as part of a space vehicle" it would not be "an ordinary satellite."
Australian Health Minister, told the House of Representatives that the sphere was identified as part of an Italian Satellite. (Australian Supply Minister)
The press release divulged the fact that the government had not located the sphere which was described as 16 inches in diameter and weighing 12 pounds.
It was said to be "stainless steel ball" on which a valve had been turned into a fused mass, apparently as a result of reentry into the earth's atmosphere.
It is interesting to note that to this metallic makeup of that first sphere has not been reported on any previous report. Further description or clarification of the physical characteristics of the sphere is needed. This could lead to a more thorough analysis of this object which was found in South Africa in early 1963.
There was no death that this object came from the fuel tank of an Atlas rocket. There was no doubt that this object, is both strange and peculiar. No more reports have been received concerning the reason that the Australian spheres have not been identified.
The press release states unequivocally that the sphere has been discovered by Russia and the U.S. Then where?

TASMANIA
Mystery object returns

I, ___________, report that on the night of May 23rd, 1959, Mrs. ___________, and I sighted an unusual object in the sky over ___________. It was about 9:15 p.m. when we first noticed the object, which appeared to be hovering about 4,000 feet above the earth. We watched it for about half an hour, during which time it moved across the sky at a terrific speed, stopping and hovering at intervals.

The object was cigar-shaped, about 150 to 200 feet long, and was illuminated by a brilliant white light that appeared to pulse or throb. On two occasions the object simply vanished, only to reappear a short distance away a few seconds later. We had the distinct impression that the object was under intelligent control.

When it finally disappeared, we stood there amazed, discussing what we had seen. The object had moved silently, without a sound, except for a faint humming noise which was barely audible. It was the most unusual and spectacular sight either of us had ever witnessed.

This is the second time in the past year that Mrs. ___________ and I have seen this same or a similar object. The first sighting occurred in June 1958, when the object was observed for over an hour as it maneuvered silently over the area. On that occasion it was seen by several other people who happened to be outside at the time.

I am convinced that the object we saw is not of this world, and I can only speculate as to its origin and purpose. Whatever it was, it is obvious that its performance capabilities far exceed anything known to modern aeronautical science. I hope this report will be of interest to your organization.

REPORT: WISCONSIN

Four college students saw a group of bright luminous circular objects traveling at tremendous speed over Lake Michigan on April 17, 1963. They observed the objects for about 3 hours and 5 minutes. The objects appeared to be about 40 feet in diameter and glowed with a bluish-white light. When investigated, the incident was determined to be "saucers" themselves, according to the witnesses.

Lights At Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin
During the lock preceding 19 April 1963, strange lights were seen maneuvering in the skies above Fond Du Lac. On Thursday night, bright lights at diverse trajectories were sighted at about 8:20 to 8:30 p.m. CST.
These lights, brighter than any stars in color, moved rapidly and now and then in a direction from horizon to horizon. The direction of travel was mostly east to west. It was also noted that they made sharp turns.
An official fisherman for the Federal Aviation Agency in Milwaukee stated that the agency could find no explanation for the sightings. He indicated that the office had received similar reports a week earlier and had determined that the objects were airplanes, and most likely bombers which renewed operations over Vietnam on 1 April. But this case sounds like another "possible" identification.

Text Transcription:
The New Jersey Fireball of April 23, 1962
On the evening of Monday, April 23, 1962, observers all along the eastern seaboard of the United States were startled by the appearance of a brilliant object in the sky moving from southwest to northeast. This object was reported as a fireball, and from parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania it was observed both visually and photographically. 
The event was observed by members of the American Astronomical Society. Both visual and photographic observations were made, and the fireball was estimated to be about magnitude -7, somewhat brighter than Jupiter. It was seen widely in the east, and reports of it came in from as far south as the Philadelphia area, where a flock of birds panicked and scattered, indicating the intensity of the light.
The fireball was studied and analyzed by various researchers, and its path was determined from photographs taken at several locations. It passed over northern New Jersey, being seen as far north as New York, and as far south as the Philadelphia area. From its observed path and velocity, it was calculated that the object entered the earth's atmosphere at an estimated altitude of 85 kilometers, moving at a velocity of 17 kilometers per second. From 22 reports, it appeared that the duration of the fireball was between 6 and 10 seconds. At its brightest, the fireball attained an apparent magnitude of -7, or about 35 kilometers per second. The body did not explode, and no fragments were recovered.

ASTRONOMY

Mars Still Bright in April Sky

Though Mars is rapidly receding and its apparent size is diminishing, it remains prominent in the evening sky of April.

ALTHOUGH MARS is rapidly receding and its size in the sky is diminishing each day, it remains a bright object in the evening sky of April. The planet is highest in the west at twilight, while Mars remains prominent in the southwest.

24, 1964

For a few days about then it will be difficult to see with the unaided eye due to the glare of the planet Venus, which will appear very close to it in the southwest sky each evening. But after April 1, Mars will again be easily visible as a rather bright, reddish object in the south-west.

Ordinarily, these maps show only stars and planets visible about 8:30 P.M. local time. But if you get out into the country, away from city lights, you can see much more. The gibbous Moon, for example, will appear close to Mars on the nights of April 1 and 2. And you may be able to see some of the fainter stars and constellations shown on the charts.

The planet Uranus is now relatively close to Mars and can be located with binoculars near the bright object. But it appears very small and dark in all but the largest telescopes.

THE FIELDS
Biology Chemicals Make
Life Possible on Earth

TECHNOLOGY: Why Electricity
Shines Without Heat
 This experiment is a new one, a good one
and a startling one. It shows that light can
shine without heat. According to our older
physics books, light always comes with heat.
This is a fine example of a new discovery that
is "against the rules."

This light emission comes from the inert
gas neon, when it is excited by an electric
current. Other inert gases, like argon, krypton
and xenon, also will emit light without
appreciable heat. In this process, the current
merely produces light-—no heat is generated.
The light is called "cold light" or "electro-
luminescence." It is the property of certain
substances to radiate light when an electric
current is passed through them.

This cold light effect has many applications.
It is used in small night lamps, electric signs,
automobile instrument dials, and in television
sets. Even now, there are promising
developments of using this phenomenon in
printing, information displays, and perhaps
eventually, in lighting our homes.

5-6 Satellite Will Prob-
ably Upset Atmosphere

THE S-6, a satellite to probe the upper
atmosphere, Is scheduled for launching in
early spring. It will be carried aloft by a
Thor-Agena B rocket launched from
Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.,
announced the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.

This satellite will study the chemistry and
physics of the earth's atmosphere, atmospheric
structure, composition, and ionization. It will
carry ultraviolet and X-ray spectrometers,
analyzers of charged particles, and
magnetometers.

The 350-pound satellite will be launched to
an altitude of about 800 miles. Its orbit will
carry it through the Van Allen radiation belts
over both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
Gases emitted during the launching of the
satellite will be observed by ground observers
and by the satellite itself as it moves through
them. This could upset atmospheric conditions
in the regions traversed.

The satellite has unusual features for
continuing use even if the satellite should fail.
It can be used as a passive reflector of radio
signals and as an active transmitter of signals
to be received on the ground.

Deadly Food Poisoning
Seen as Social Menace

THE DEADLY peril of food poisoning
through bacteria is considered a major public
health problem in this country. Food-borne
illnesses are a common occurrence, though
many go unreported.

The cause of most food-poisoning outbreaks
is traced to staphylococcus germs, which
multiply rapidly in improperly refrigerated
foods. Salmonella poisoning also is a common
affliction.

According to Dr. Frederick J. Stare,
professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of
Public Health, the number of food-poisoning
cases is increasing. He stated there are an
estimated 2 million cases a year in this country,
and 5,000 deaths attributed to this cause.

Many victims are children, and elderly or
debilitated persons. Sporadic outbreaks in
hospitals, restaurants, schools, and institutions
are common. Much of the food involved is meat,
poultry, dairy products, fish, and egg dishes.

Refrigeration and sanitation in food
handling are the main defenses against food
poisoning. The public, as well as the food
industry, must be educated to recognize the
seriousness of the problem and to take
appropriate preventive measures.

Ma & Portage Path Area. At approximately 8:54, the witness stopped into her back-yard to close a window. As she stood there, she saw a large red light over a school. It was stationary and about the size of a basketball hoop. She watched the object for about 2 to 3 minutes. the light remained stationary and steady. The three witnesses watched the unusual object for several minutes before they continued around the east (7:30) side of the house to get a better look. The object was about 400 feet away and very large "orange-bright light" in the sky. At this point, she noticed that the object was solid and seemed to be glowing periodically. It hovered for several minutes and then slowly, steadily regain its original brilliants. The case was reported several hours later with the 7:30 estimate. The observers were certain that the object had the most intense coloring, the peculiar glowing qualities and the color was the "orangest-orange". 
LIGHT: After watching the strange object or phenomena for some time, the witnesses are decided to have a look at the light over the school. It was no longer visible. She returned to the kitchen window and she observed that the light had the most intense coloring, like an arc-welding flash. The light a eas brightly glowing and about the size of a basketball hoop. It remained stationary for a few more minutes. It was still visible when she went indoors. Later, the object could be seen - neither was visible for more than about 5 minutes.
