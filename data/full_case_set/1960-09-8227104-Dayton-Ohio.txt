1. DATE  8/22/52
2. LOCATION  DAYTON, OHIO
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 1305L
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar; AV-Visual; Ground-Visual
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 min
6. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: A radar pick-up was observed on the scope for approximately 30 sec. At about the same time, two witnesses observed a dark smoke-like object in the sky which was visible for about 3 min.
7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1 
8. HUMAN ASPECTS: 2
9. COURSE: Unknown
10. CONCLUSIONS: Possible Aircraft; Possible Missile; Probably Balloon; Possibly Astronomical; Possibly Hoax; Insufficient Data; No Identification; Probably Witnessed Something of Interest
11. COMMENTS: Past cases have shown that witnesses to UFO incidents often interpret what they see in a different manner than is actually the case. This incident would appear to be a case in point. The radar pick-up was probably a normal aircraft or balloon. The visual sighting was probably a natural phenomenon or some type of man-made object, but there is insufficient data to identify it conclusively. Without further information this incident must be classified as "No Identification".

- page 21 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report with text describing an investigation or interview related to an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

SUMMARY OF ALLEGED UFO SIGHTING

1. This case was investigated by personnel of the Aerial Phenomena Group.

2. The witness, when interviewed, again described the apparent appearance of the objects and the description was consistent with that reported on the previous initial interview. The investigation made a thorough search of the house and surrounding area in an effort to discover anything which could possibly be responsible for the sighting. This search revealed nothing to which the sighting could be attributed.

3. Further discussion with the witness brought out the fact that when she saw the objects their position relative to her head was unchanged even when she moved around. It was asked if she had any discomfort or any disconcerting distractions other than fear, when she saw the objects. The witness replied that she had a humming in her head. Further investigation brought out that the witness usually was emotionally upset prior to the sighting, and the sighting caused continued outside and experienced the sighting after standing and entering the house. The witness stated that apprehension over her experiences had prompted a visit to the doctor, who diagnosed her as being under emotional pressure.

4. It is the opinion of the investigator that the witness was sincere in her desire to relate the facts as she experienced them. The probable conditions were explained to the witness and further action was considered to be not required at this time.
