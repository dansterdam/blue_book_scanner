"Greeloy, Colorado 

Gentlemen:

I am writing this because I have a strange experience to report. On the morning of January 8, 1967, while looking out the window, I observed what appeared to be a cloud-like object moving at a high rate of speed across the sky. At first I thought it was an airplane, but as I watched it, I noticed that it was changing shape and direction. It was not making any noise that I could hear. After watching it for several minutes, it suddenly disappeared. This was not an ordinary cloud, and I can't explain what it was. 

I have told several people about this, but they seem skeptical. I am writing to you in the hope that you may be able to shed some light on this unusual occurrence.

I would be grateful if you could let me know if you have had any similar reports from this area. I am perplexed and would appreciate any information you can provide.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]"
