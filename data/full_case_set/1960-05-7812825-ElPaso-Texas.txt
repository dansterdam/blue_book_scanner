SUBJECT: Extract from Duty Officers' Report

TO: AFCIN-4K2 (M&J Friend)

The following, extracted from Capt Radcliff's Report dated 29 May 1960, is quoted for your information:

This report was received from the AFCIN DO at 0600, 30 May.

The original report was a SAC report from Bliss AFB, El Paso, Texas. A civilian in that area reported seeing a large bright light in the sky. Further investigation indicated that the object had a bright orange tail.

Two El Paso policemen and the Bliss weather observer also saw the object. The policemen reported seeing the object for a short period only and then it seemed to fall to the ground while the other continued its flight. That object did disappear which fell to the ground is being investigated.

A T-33 Acft reported seeing this phenomena near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The entire incident occurred approximately 0302z, 30 May.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: Biggs AFB, Texas
Initial Report
PAGE 3 OF 3
Paragraph k. Preliminary analysis: Generally the data received from this sighting indicates that the object was in view briefly, as to speed and flight path. There appears to be conflicting information as to the apparent size of the object however, I feel that the obvious distance traveled by the object during this period also conforms to the speed of the object as it is known to explode and disappear. No information in any of the reports indicated that the object was any thing other than an astronomical body.
