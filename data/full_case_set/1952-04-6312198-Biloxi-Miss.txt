SWORN STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED
22 April 1952

V. C. Maccaull. Wariant Eng., New Mexico, 783th Aircraft Control and Warning Sqdn, advises the following statement:

At 1315 MST, 13 April 1952, an observation was directed to an aircraft, which I thought to be a jet, flying at approximately 15,000-20,000 feet in the direction of the city. The object was something extraordinary due to its maneuverability. It rose rapidly to about 40,000 feet almost vertically, stopped, and then dropped suddenly to about 5,000 feet. It again rose rapidly to 40,000 feet, only to drop again. It repeated these maneuvers several times. It was a bright, silvery object, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and without any visible markings, wings, tail, or other conventional aircraft features. I cannot go into any great detail as to its structure.

As I have the approximate path or flight of the object was in sight from my position, but I still could not determine its nature. 

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 22nd day of April 1952.

1. S/S 22 April 1952
This is the statement of Capt USAF, ____________, Biloxi, Miss referring to sighting of unidentified aircraft control and movement as reported to the Aircraft Control and Radar units on above date.

On 22 April 1952 I was engaged in routine training flights over the Gulfport area. At approximately 0130 csr time, my attention was attracted to a strange object in the sky. This object was pointed out to me by another observer, and at that time it seemed to be hovering in the sky. As I observed this object, it gradually moved away, appearing to climb at a tremendous rate of speed. The object gave off a bluish white glow which seemed to light up the sky for quite some distance. There was no sound or exhaust as would be expected from a jet, propeller, or rocket type aircraft. The color seemed to be a brilliant bluish white, as I have described, and remained constant throughout the observation. The object made absolutely no sound and maintained a steady and rapid rate of climb which I would estimate to be in excess of 2000 mph. There was no deviation or change in direction, and the object seemed to disappear in the northeastern sky.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 22nd day of April 1952.

PLACE REPORTED: Biloxi, Mississippi 
DATE: 13 April 1952

SUBJECT: "Reporting of Information on Unidentified Flying Objects"

SYNOPSIS: At approximately 2107 hours CDT on 13 April 1952, two civilian observers reported observing a bright object in the sky near Biloxi, Mississippi. The object was observed for approximately 45 minutes and was described as glowing brightly, rapidly changing colors, and making abrupt changes in direction. The observers could distinguish three distinct objects at one point during the observation. The objects were at an estimated altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet and traveled at an estimated speed of 600 to 800 miles per hour. The observers could not identify the objects.

I, ______, 165th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Biloxi, Mississippi, do hereby make the following statements:

On 23 April 1952, I was coming out of the Squadron Mess Hall when I saw what looked like a flying saucer. The time was about 1945 mountain standard time. The object was traveling at an unestimated speed and at what looked like to be flying at approximately 40,000 feet. The object was visible until it turned sideways at which time it disappeared because of the saucer like shape. After approximately five (5) to ten (10) minutes after sighting, the object disappeared.

Sworn to and subscribed before me on this 22nd day of April 1952.

Information Pertinent to Objects Sighted:
1. Shape: The shape of the objects sighted was reported as being round, "disc-like".
2. Size: No estimation of the size of the objects sighted was advanced by the observer due to his inability to determine accurately the size of the objects.
3. Color: The objects appeared to be a dull orange color, comparable to the glow of heated metal.
4. Number: Three (3).
5. Trail or exhaust: None observed.
6. Propulsion system: None observed.
7. Speed: No estimation of speed was made by the observer due to lack of knowledge concerning the size of the objects. However, the observer stated the speed to have been very fast.
8. Sounds: No sounds were detected.
9. Maneuvers: Erratic line formation, flying straight across the sky. See sketch.
10. Manner of Disappearance: The objects disappeared rapidly (in a matter of a few seconds) in sight of the observer. The objects appeared to change formation or alter their pattern and then seemed to accelerate rapidly and disappear from view.

1. On 6 April 1952, the following report was received from Air Defense Command at Biloxi, Mississippi:

"At approximately 11:00 a.m., Central Standard Time, 6 April 1952, an unidentified aerial object was observed by Mrs. N. R. Burr, 3300 Delauney Street, Biloxi, Mississippi, while she was doing laundry in her back yard.

"Mrs. Burr stated that she observed the object for approximately one minute. She described it as circular in shape, about the size of a dinner plate, and metallic silver in color. The object was moving in a south to north direction at an estimated altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 feet and at a speed estimated at 150 to 200 miles per hour.

"The object was observed to make a sudden vertical ascent and then disappear from sight."

MEMO FOR FILE: 
Radar Scope Photo Bilox~, Mississippi
6 April 1952
The attached photograph was obtained from the Director, Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, on 16 April 1952. This photograph is the only one available and must be returned to the Director, Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, at the conclusion of the analysis. 
The photograph was taken during radar operations at Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi, on 6 April 1952. The radar set used was a SCR-584 and the scope photograph was taken by Captain Randall M. Selff, 3902nd Radar Evaluation Squadron, Keesler AFB, Biloxi, Mississippi.
The photograph shows an unusual radar presentation which Captain Selff considers of interest. He described the presentation as follows: 
"The radar presentation shows a series of evenly spaced, parallel lines, each line being composed of a series of dots. The lines are oriented in a northeast-southwest direction and appear to be at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet. The lines are approximately 5 miles apart and extend across the entire radar scope, which has a range of 120 miles."
No further information or evaluation is available at this time. The photograph is being forwarded for any analysis or comments the Director, Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, may wish to make.

STATEMENT

Personally appeared before me, the undersigned, authorized to administer oaths in cases of this nature, Willie Lillebridge, who, being duly sworn according to law, deposes and says:

While attending the Beach Drive-in Theater on the night of 15 March 1952, my wife and I observed in the sky over the Gulf of Mexico an object which appeared to be about the size of a weather balloon. The object remained stationary for approximately 10 to 12 minutes, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared at a tremendous rate of speed, going in an easterly direction. The object's color was a fluorescent white, and there appeared to be no sound or trail of any kind. This sight was observed by myself and my wife, and several other persons in the vicinity.

We believe that the possibility of sighted objects being caused by the failure of optical instruments of the observers, or to the diffraction of light from natural sources, is not applicable to this case, since the object was clearly defined and the difference in color between a star and the observed object was quite distinct.

Subscribed and sworn to before me this, the eighteenth (18th) day of April 1952, at Biloxi, Mississipp.

UNCLASSIFIED 22 April 1952

I, W. G., Herman H. Rarphirty, Warrant Officer, US Air Force, request authority to make the following statement:

While standing in front of the base of the 75th aircraft Control and Earing Squadron, I sighted an object which appeared to be circular in shape and made a noise similar to that of a jet aircraft. The object was traveling on a level course at a very high rate of speed and it appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length. The object turned off to the left and was lost to sight in less than 10 seconds. Due to the suddenness of its appearance and disappearance, and the fact that it was seen in daylight, I am unable to make any further comment or description.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 22nd day of April 1952.
