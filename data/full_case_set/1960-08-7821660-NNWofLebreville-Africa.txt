(2) UNLIMITED

(3) SOLID UNDERCAST TOPS ESTIMATED AT 9,000 FEET

(4) NONE

(6) PLUS 13 DEGREES "C"

(7) OBJECT EXPLODED IN A BRILLIANT FLASH AT ESTIMATED ALTITUDE 25,000 TO 30,000 FEET AFTER FOUR SECONDS OBSERVATION ON ITS COURSE. SIZE OF FLASH WAS AT LEAST TWO FEET IN DIAMETER AT ARMS LENGTH. AFTER EXPLOSION A BRILLIANT GREEN TRAIL WAS OBSERVED IN AN ARC OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY DEGREES WHICH LASTED APPROXIMATELY TWO SECONDS AND CHANGED INTO A WHITISH GREY TRAIL WHICH INDICATED CLOUD DISSIPATION. FIVE FEET HIGH WHEN HELD AT ARMS LENGTH. OBSERVATION OF THIS CLOUD WAS OBSERVED BEING DISPATED BY THE WINDS ALOFT. THIS CLOUD LASTED FOR A PERIOD OF NINE MINUTES. POSITION OF THE FLASH AND CLOUD FORMATION WAS ESTIMATED AT 30 MI FROM OBSERVERS POSITION.

The image does not contain any photograph or visual information. It appears to be a typed descriptive text about an incident. As per the instructions, I will now proceed to extract and output the text from the document:

Description cont'd

Size of the flash was at least 2 feet in diameter at 11,000 feet. After explosion the flash of the blast was changed to a whitish grayish cloud estimated to be long and a foot high when said at some length the cloud was observed being dissipated by the wind. The object that caused this incident has not been determined.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: NNW of Lebreville, west Africa (Gabon)
Date: 22 August 1960
Hour (Z): 17:15
WX: Vis unl., solid undercast, scattered clouds in above
Description: Round, size of volly ball at arms length, orange, first seen descending then ascended (209 deg) 80 deg elev, last seen at 240 deg 45 deg elev, object moved south in a downward arc, it exploded in a brilliant flash at an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 ft altitude after about 4 seconds or one on it's course (over)
Direction of Motion: South
Satellites: (ARGIN-4F3, Phone 69219) Ruled out
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): Prob meteor (bolide)
Radar Analysis (ARGIN-4F1): None
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): -------
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Ruled out
Other:
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Prob reliable
Analysis and Conclusions: The apparent size, shape and speed of the object suggest that it may have been a type of meteor or other natural phenomenon moving in the direction indicated at the time. The description of the object is very similar to that of a meteor, though the ascent and final descent pattern is perhaps somewhat unusual. However, the case cannot be satisfactorily explained and should be considered as unidentified at this time.
