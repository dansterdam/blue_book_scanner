TEST (UFO)

UFO Report, 13 October 1963

1. LOCI AB WG (DOBO)
1. Reference the attached unidentified flying object (UFO) report. The form was received at this office on 17 October 1963. The observer does not appear to have been investigated in accordance with AFR 200-2, and this investigation has no report.

2. Page 3 of the completed form indicates that the observer took a photograph of the object. However, photographic analysis cannot be performed without the original negative. The observer indicated they will be returned to the owner upon completion of the form.

3. We would appreciate comments from the reporting officer as to whether photographic analysis was made and any other comments concerning this case that would be helpful to our analysts if additional data is received, such as:

a. RADAR PERSONNEL - Whether they had any identified or unidentified blips at this time or the observation.
b. CONTROL TOWER PERSONNEL - Statement as to whether the contrail or object was observed by the time of the observation.
c. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES - Often, they can provide information as to the reliability of the witness. Also, they may have received public reaction to the UFO sighting, or other information that may be of value.

It is important that you provide this information in your report so that our office does not duplicate your investigation.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

On October 9th, 1968, at approximately 1930 hours, a resident of North Forestville, Maryland, reported sighting an unidentified flying object (UFO) to the authorities. The witness, whose name is redacted, stated that the object was observed for approximately 10 minutes, during which time it appeared to hover and maneuver in the sky. 

The witness took several photographs of the object, two of which are included in this report. However, the quality of the photographs is poor, and the object is not clearly visible. The witness described the object as circular in shape, with a bright, glowing light emanating from it.

The report concludes that the incident could not be definitively identified as a specific known object or phenomenon. Further investigation was not possible due to the limited information and poor quality of the photographic evidence.

TO: TDPT (UFO)
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB
OHIO 45433

1. Through an oversight, the inclosed photographs of the UFO were not forwarded with the AF Form 112. The photos were made with a Polaroid camera and the inclosed copies were made here since the sighter could not loan the originals.

2. The sighting was investigated by the Base Operations Duty Officer thoroughly. There were no radar pickups nor were there any other witnesses. Although the possibility of the sighter is limited as a trained observer, the details in the background as the initial report was given over the telephone. The design of the "saucer" in the photo is familiar to records the Base Operations Officer has seen constructed by local High School students.
