To: Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.

1. I find that there is not enough information to attempt a detailed analysis. I would appreciate through interrogation of the witness(es), but since the witness is a 12-year-old boy, my color on the estimate may still be questioned by the general public.

2. If you authorize it, I will be happy to make a phone call and attempt a further evaluation of the facts.

3. From the limited data at hand, a meteor explanation seems the most likely even though five seconds is too long a time to be consistent with such an explanation, and the contradictions with the relatively short arc covered in five seconds also seem to contradict such an explanation.

4. I would recommend that the phone call be made.

UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA
Flower and Cook Observatory 
1968 Feb. 23

Dear Major Quintanilla:

In reply to your letter of Feb. 19 which concerned an observation report of Feb. 23, I wish to inform you that we examined the report carefully and found that no fireball was reported on that night to this observatory.  This means little to us, undoubtedly, since we receive many reports only of small persons or those which are likely to be dismissed as ordinary meteors.

The report in question was sent to us to examine, as explained to you before, and no fireball was reported on that night.  Your cooperation in sending us this report is very much appreciated and helpful.

Sincerely yours,

C. P. OLIVIER
Associate Director

This refers to your report concerning your observation of an unidentified flying object on 17 June 1967. 

While we appreciate your contribution, we must advise that a year later is a while when an error is made. We regret that proper investigation of the incident may no longer be possible. However, we will attempt to determine the stimulus for your observation.

Miss Turnure/SAF-OTS/76326/1 Sep 67

Dear [redacted],

This replies to your recent letter concerning your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without essential information, such as detailed flight characteristics, duration of observation, or weather information, it is not possible for us to conduct a useful investigation. If you contacted the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base, additional information may have been possible.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help to you in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear Gentlemen:
On the 17th day of June, 1967, at around 10:00 P.M., I had seen what appeared to be a meteor re-entering the atmosphere. I have seen many meteors before but like this "thing". I saw it enter from the sky, and come at a great speed for five seconds before it disappeared. The strange thing about it was that it's a white light but on and off three times before it disappeared. There was no sign of it after it was gone.
Yours truly,
Age 12?
P.S. Please look into this thoroughly.

Dear gentleman,
Incidentally, I had written about a UFO. I had written to me and had stated the "insufficient data." I shall now give you all the information I can on June 19, 1967 at around 10:00 pm. I was evidently a meteor. The sky was clear with moderate atmospheric conditions (it was a clear night sky). However, my house at an extremely high altitude about 3 miles southwest of Phoenix, Arizona. It came straight down and when it appeared, it had an estimated 150-1,000 miles per hour and then disappeared in off 3 times. I did not see an explosion nor heard any sound.

After consider- ation, the investigator decided that he thought the observation was of an object that he could not identify, but should be explained as an known object. The strange thing was that the object appeared to be a meteor, but it remained visible for a much longer period of time than a meteor normally would. It was observed by 3 witnesses.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

UNCLASSIFIED (UFO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/shs/3 May 63
UFO OBSERVATION, 17 June 1967

Dr. J. Allen Hynek

Reference your letter of 23 February 1963 with regards to
observation of 17 June 1967. This relates to a report submitted
on a sighting that was telephoned to this office by
observers. You may certainly do so if you feel
it is not necessary.

As you may know, a good copy of the investigating report
has been obtained and forwarded to the technical library
records center. It appears to have been made from an excellent
negative and the color and details are quite clear. It will
not be necessary for me to obtain another copy since the one on
file appears to be a copy of what I would consider a satisfactory
original.
