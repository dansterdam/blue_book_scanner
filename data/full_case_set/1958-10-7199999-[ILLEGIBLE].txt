The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with points A and B marked on it. This sketch asks the viewer to imagine being at the point shown and placing an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when first seen, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when last seen.

The second sketch shows a larger panoramic view, with a person standing in the foreground and various buildings and landscape features in the background. There is also a smaller inset sketch in the bottom right corner that appears to be a simplified or abstracted version of the larger panoramic view.

Regarding the text in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

In order that your information may be filled and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may restate information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present details of the observation as accurately as possible.

Feeling - in pulling dazzch chain & watching aircraft spotted bright, day + dazzehling train coming from NW, seen for approx. 15 minutes until it gained ht & made a turn to the south. At the same time, moving quite rapidly, than customery for air plane, was an object that appeared to be a large white sphere or balloon. It seemed about the same size as the observed aircraft, but the light was diffuse + hazy, no distinct light source. Almost immediately a second object, somewhat smaller appeared to the left of the first one. Object passed westward at a tremendous rate of speed, estimated 3,000 - 6,000 miles per hour. The objects disappeared from sight very suddenly, either they went out of range or speed, so rapid it was impossible to time or judge their exact departure.

- page 9 -

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. 

The text in the document is as follows:

While it was in S.E., a low flying plane flew over the object and banked in such a manner that the observer was able to see the underside of the plane. Although point was taken to calculate the size of the object, distance was so great that it could not be accurately determined. The object made no sound and traveled on a very level course. The speed was moderately fast but did not appear tremendous. The object made no turns and traveled on a straight course. As it passed through occasional "vapors," it belched and got lost in certain areas. Could hardly have been visible for more than 15-20 seconds, but the rays of the sun were such that it was indistinctly visible and could not be observed constantly. It seemed to disappear, reappeared, and disappeared at least 3-4 times and passed through at the rate of approximately 9:30. Could be easily accurate from the relative of the observer.

A check was made with the Army and Navy for any helicopters. H-37's are stationed in San Francisco area. These aircraft fit the description given by the witness. They have an engine on each side of the fuselage driving one large rotor.

The conclusion of this Center is that the H-37's flying in the area as described is probably the object seen in production for a specific training mission at a nearby location.

Text from the document:

Pleasant Hill, Calif. 
October 9, 1958

Weather Bureau
Oakland Airport
Oakland, California

Gentlemen:

I would like to call to your attention an object of interest which was noted in the sky at 9:20 P.M. and to have received are other reports about it.

The object itself appeared as a hazy bar of light, perhaps a description better than in the middle, correct to some degree of brilliance. 

The object appeared in the west, passed rapidly across the sky to 20 to 40 degrees south of the zenith, executing a couple turns, and vanished into the northeast. At that time, an airplane headed southwest from the direction of Oakland to Travis. 

For a few seconds, both plane and object were visible to me, and the change was such that I hastened to the Oakland Airport, that they have seen it.

The duration of the object's appearance could hardly have exceeded 15 seconds. From the rapidity with which its size and brightness changed, as it moved, it seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed. It moved much too fast to be heard until the appearance of the above-mentioned plane.

The size of the object, its hazy, steady light, its ability to execute sharp turns and lack of luminous train clearly indicate it was not a meteor, several of which I also saw last night.

I would much appreciate any information you can give me on the nature and sightings of this object. I realize your department may not handle such matters, but would appreciate your bringing this letter to the attention of the proper authorities.

Yours very truly,
[Signature]

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a letter written on November 8, 1958, addressed to Col. H. K. Gilbert from the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The letter discusses the writer's response to Col. Gilbert's letter of October 30, 1958, regarding an unidentified flying object. The writer states that estimates of size, distance, etc. are almost impossible to make, but a comparison could be made with a small airplane flying low and moving very fast. The writer expresses a desire to learn more about the object.

COMMENTS (See reverse, if necessary)
1. A check was made with the Army Aviation Section and it was found they have six helicopters, H-37's, stationed in San Francisco area. These aircraft fit the description given by Mr.___ driving one large rotor. They have an engine on each side of the fuselage.
2. The conclusion of this Center is that Mr. H-37's flying in the area. These aircraft have been in production for approximately three years and probably are not based at very many locations.
