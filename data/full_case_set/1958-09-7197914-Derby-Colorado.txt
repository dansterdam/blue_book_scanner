The image appears to contain a memo routing slip with information about a 35mm color slide. The slide was returned to Mr. Derby in Colorado. The ATIC photo lab determined that the red dot in the center of the slide was a perforation of one or two layers of emulsion, likely caused by a small rise with a pit at the center from a light source.

The text in the document is as follows:

1. The attached 35MM color slide is to be returned to Mr. Derby, Colorado.
2. The red dot was determined by the ATIC photo lab to be a perforation of one or two layers of emulsion. If the slide is held at an angle to a light source, a small rise with a pit at the center can then be seen.

Dear Mr. [redacted],

I am returning herewith your 35 mm color slide which you thought show an unidentified flying object.

The red dot was determined by the Air Technical Intelligence Center photo lab people to be a presentation of one or two layers of emulsion. If the slide is held at an angle to a light source, a small size with a pit at the center can then be seen.

Sincerely,
