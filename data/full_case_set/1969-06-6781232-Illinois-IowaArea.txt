DEAR SIRS:

I am man-old and live in Nelsonville, Ohio. Just recently I had an experience I would like to share with you. It happened on May 24, 1964 on my way home from South Carolina. I was traveling northward.

As I approached Nelsonville, Ohio, I noticed something very strange in the sky. At first I thought it was a commercial airplane, but as it drew closer I could see that it was not. It was a huge, circular, disk-shaped object that seemed to be hovering or floating in the air. It had a large dome on top and was giving off a brilliant white light. The object appeared to be about 200 to 300 feet in diameter. 

As I continued to watch, the object began to move slowly in a northeasterly direction. It continued on this course for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated to an unbelievable speed and disappeared from sight. I was absolutely amazed and dumbfounded by what I had witnessed. 

I have thought about this experience many times since then, and I am convinced that what I saw was some kind of unidentified flying object. I would appreciate any information you could provide about similar sightings in this area.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

The text from the document is as follows:

"Approx. 41:52 a.m. When sighted object was gradually moving on a northerly course and was stationary and glowing at a spot for several seconds and then accelerated and moved off rapidly and disappeared completely from view. This object did not make a noise and was silent through the complete observation on the sighting. The object came to a dead stop and hovered motionless for several seconds and then accelerated at a high rate of speed and moved off rapidly and disappeared completely from view. The object was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter and was a brilliant white color and appeared extremely bright. It was moving at a high rate of speed and then would stop and hover motionless for several seconds at a time before accelerating and moving off again. I would estimate the total time of the observation to be around 3 minutes. The object made no sound whatever during the complete observation."

Text transcribed from the document:

The sighting began at a bean picker field where a man was working. A man in the field told us he saw the object and would like to say that the occurrence was at first entirely unpleasant, being as it was a totally unexpected personal experience. However, he stated that the object itself did not appear to have any really threatening quality, although it caused quite a turmoil among the people in the area. Everyone near who saw the object had heard of it just a few minutes before it actually appeared to have hovered motionless over the field for a short time, then moved off slowly enough for its silhouette to be clearly observed. The man in the field would gladly give any further information that might be of help in investigating the matter and would like to know if anything unusual was reported in the area that night.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Many letters from people who have been disturbed by an unusual sighting are received, and it is gratifying to note that some of them feel that the sharing of their experience may be of some help, and that they are willing to take the time to put their story down. Some details, in certain circumstances, make it difficult to fully evaluate the facts, but when your main problem is deciding whether what you saw was a UFO, or just your imagination, your main problem is real and needs consideration.

I feel that you must have been quite convinced that what you saw was very unusual, and that was the reason for your writing. However, the real and whole story is usually not made clear unless certain details are given, such as the date, time, location, weather conditions, direction of travel, size, shape, color, speed, and duration of the object observed. Many of these facts are often not mentioned by the writer, possibly because the person does not realize that they are important to the evaluation of the sighting.

If possible, I would like to photo-graph whatever it was that you saw. Would you be willing to send in a photograph if you are able to obtain one?

Sincerely yours,

[redacted]
