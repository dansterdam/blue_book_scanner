AUG - 15,1967

WHEN READING MY SIGHTING REPORT AND NARRATIVE I FEEL IT WAS NOT AN ORDINARY AIR CRAFT OR STELLAR OBJECT.IT WAS VERY CAREFULL Y STUDIED AS IT MOVED ACROSS THE SKY BETWEEN THE CLOUDS.IT WAS DEFINETLY NOT A NORMAL AIRCRAFT OR STAR. I THINK THE OBSERVER COMPLETELY DESCRIBED HER SIGHTING. THERE CAME MORE MOVEMENT THAT LOOKED LIKE IT TURNED OR ROTATED WHEN IT LOST ITS SPEED AND ALTITUDE.IT JUST HOVERED AT A LOW LEVEL.THERE IS NO DOUBT IT WAS SOMETHING QUITE UNUSUAL AND ATTRACTED A LOT OF ATTENTION WHEN IT APPEARED. THESE ARE JUST MY OWN PERSONAL IMPRESSIONS OF THE SIGHTING.

TYPED COMMENTS MADE BY DR. J. ALLEN HYNEK ON JUNE 1968
MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE 25 JULY 1967
Another single witness case. The present "possible aircraft" evaluation is not in line with the report unless we say the report is grossly in error.
Report does not indicate tangential motion. He described appearance as bright red. There was no sound, but object was in sight only 1Â½ minutes. His "A" and "B" on page 5 of his report are identical and not moving--except away from observer.
A detailed follow-up would have been needed to properly evaluate this sighting. Soc "tangible aircraft" is possible unidentified.

CORRESPONDENCE

TO: Prof. Blue Book FROM: J. A. Hynek
DEPT.: DEPT.: 
DATE: June 1, 1965

A review of sighting reports indicates that the report under case No. 287,550/67 is apparently a multiple-witness sighting of what was reported as an unidentified flying object.

Considerable correspondence has been received on this sighting, and it is recommended that an investigator be assigned to look into this further. A detailed study of the evidence seems to be warranted, as the reports indicate that the sighting was made by a number of reliable witnesses.

So - please advise me as to the recommendation in this case.

31. 10 July 1967. Azalea, Mississippi:
See attached supplemental report B.

32. 11 July 1967. Macon, Georgia:
Temporarily misplaced. Check to see whether this has any relation to the sighting the previous day in Azalea, Mississippi.

33. 25 July 1967. Manchester, New Hampshire:
The only Manchester, New Hampshire case I have is for a different date.

34. 12 October 1967. Ocaloosa County, Florida: 
Although this had been witnessed, the data are very poor. A balloon is said to be seen but because of winds at altitude, one tracking the other, higher flights, etc., anyone of three evaluations: (1) insufficient data (2) probable aircraft (3) possible unknown.

35. 31 October 1967. Denver, Colorado:
Do not have in my files. Will do in Dayton.
