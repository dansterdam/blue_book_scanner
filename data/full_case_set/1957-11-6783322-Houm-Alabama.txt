1. ABOUT 2230 HOURS ON 27 NOVEMBER 1957, A OBJECT WAS OBSERVED AT CIC STEWART AFB BY OBSERVERS ON DUTY. THE OBJECT WAS A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT TRAVELLING IN A NORTHWESTERLY DIRECTION AT APPROXIMATELY 1500 KNOTS. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR 2 OR 3 MINUTES BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY TWO AIRMAN FIRST CLASS, WRIGHT, AIR FORCE SPECIALTY CODE 20245. AFTER THE OBJECT PASSED, A LOUD RUMBLING SOUND WAS HEARD. THE OBJECT LEFT NO TRAIL AND ITS SPEED AND MANEUVERABILITY CAUSED GREAT EXCITEMENT AND INTEREST AMONG THE OBSERVERS. OBJECT OBSERVED IN CLEAR SKIES.
2. THIS STATION HAS CONTINUED VISUAL OBSERVATION OF THE SKY FOR SEVERAL HOURS AFTER THIS SIGHTING, BUT NO FURTHER OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED.
3. AIRMAN FIRST CLASS WRIGHT HAS BEEN STATIONED AT THIS STATION FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE AND ONE HALF YEARS. HIS OBSERVER EXPERIENCE IS OVER HALF YEAR. HE HAS OBSERVED SEVERAL AIRCRAFT IN HIS CAREER, BUT HAS NEVER OBSERVED AN OBJECT WITH THIS STATION'S PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS. ADDITIONALLY, THIS WAS THE FIRST UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT OBSERVED BY THIS STATION.

52 KNOTS THE TOP OF HEIGHT RANGE INDICATOR INDICATION WAS 45. 222 FEET AND AIRSPEED INDICATED ON THE AIRCRAFT RECORDER WAS 240 KNOTS. THE ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE SITUATION AND A COMMERCIAL ALL AIRLINES RADIO BROADCAST HAD BEEN MADE CONCERNING THE SIGHTING. THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AT A TIME WHEN THE TRACK WAS ONLY 2 MILES FROM THE SITE. THIS WAS ALL IT TIME WHEN THE TARGET WAS ACQUIRED BY RADAR AND HAS A KNOWN DURATION OF APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES FROM START TO FINISH. THE ALTITUDE AT THIS TIME WAS FIRST PICKED UP BY THE TARGET RADARS AT 25,000 FEET. BOTH RADAR AND VISUAL CONTACT AND BOTH ASSUMED TO BE WEATHER BALLOONS. SIGNALS FROM BOTH RADAR AND VISUAL CONTACT WAS LOST AT THE SAME TIME.
AT THIS TIME BOTH THE RADAR AND OTHER SITES HAD LOST CONTACT WITH IT CONTROLLER FOUND THAT MALFUNCTION RADAR SCOPE AND OUTPUT FROM ANTENNA WAS NOT BEING RECEIVED BY AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SQUADRON. THE TARGET WAS OBSERVED ON MPS-7 AND MPS-14 RADAR EQUIPMENT. THE SEARCH SCOPE WERE UPA-22 AND CA-472.

THE RADAR SCOPE WAS CLASSIFIED
HAD BEEN ENCOUNTERED RECENTLY. A THYRATRON TYPE MODULATOR IS

ENCOUNTERED IN RADAR AND ALL PERSONNEL ARE FAMILIAR WITH IT.
THERE WAS A DELAY STANDING BY THIS RADAR-HIS RETURN EXCEEDED NORMAL TRACE BY

RADAR INDICATED SPEEDS UP TO 17,000 MPH AT TIMES IN DISASTER OF

SIGHTED LATER APPROACHING GROUND CLUTTER FROM RAIN AND WAS COMPLETELY
LOST TO THE SCOPE. LOOKING FOR STRATEGIC STAR CLUSTER AIRCRAFT WITH NEGATIVE
RESULTS. LOOKING FOR STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND AIRCRAFT WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS. THIS
UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT SIGNALED OUT AT UHF-IT MADE A RANGE OF 52 MILES OR
LESS. LIGHT SIGNALS TOOK OUT ALL RADAR SIGNAL.BEACON WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN
FROM LAND AND IN THE END BEFORE YOUR GROUND CLUTTER AND SIGNAL WAS LOST.
SIGNAL LOSS AND THEN RETURN AND THEN AGAIN LOSS OF SIGNAL. AT RATE OF
23.5 MEGACYCLES AND THE RANGE INDICATOR 14/15 MEGACYCLES. 
CHARACTERISTICS INDICATE THAT UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT TOOK FAST AND ALL
ACTIONS OBSERVED. UNCLASSIFIED

FILE NO. 	SUBJECT UFO Report T57-31737
TO AFGIN-HEL  	FROM AFCIN-HEL 
1. The subject report, submitted by 1st Lt Gregory, WGAF, Houm, Alabama, refers to a visual observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) observed about 1930 hrs, 5 Nov 57. The object was described as bright, oval-shaped, and the size of a "DC-6" at a distance of 35 miles. The object was observed for 10-15 minutes, remained stationary at first, then moved slowly east and disappeared. The weather was clear, temperature about 60 F, and visibility good. The target was tracked on radar, confirmed visually, and its inability of airborne radar to pick up the target (while searching) indicates it was not metallic. The report states that the object rose slowly up and down, and would not move fast, the results of such weather changes frequently do not move at very high speeds. Suspected to be a natural phenomenon, such as a balloon, or an unusual meteorological conditions, but no conclusions have been established, This report is one of the many brought about by some weather condition. The fact that no aircraft were assembled for the mission, and that the incident was not investigated, serve to indicate the nature of the incident.
2. End. 5 Nov 57
