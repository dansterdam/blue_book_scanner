II. RELIABILITY: Although SOURCE olainns to have had two ..semenie and
although he holds a GS-11 rating, he deofs he has od 
details of the sighting he witnessed, and so is able to raseeme precisely what he
saw; however, 'tater mede somewhat contradictory statements. At first he stated
that as the object passed at its nearest point, he thit "Kind of a heat wave" and
that when he reached home he found he had a severe Sun eum. Subsequent mediéal
observation adisclosed that there was no trece of Sunburn; and SOURCE later admitted
that he had been in error on this point. By the time this interviewer was able te
make arrangements to talk whh SOURCE; he had been interviewed several times by
reporters and had made a trapdio interviews he did not seem aeverse to the large
amounts of publicity which followed.      
 
airy he is a "technician". SOURCE, on several occasions, stated aint he hed
some doubts as to whether or not hs should report his sighting: in mder to resolve
this question, he had telephoned hies chief, who'told him he saw nothing wrong in
describing it. SOURCE was quite definite in his statements and appeared to have
little doubt about arsy details of what he had seen. ea : 

IIL SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At approodm...,012010) Nov 57, SOURCE
was driving south in open countryside on US Highway 5L toward Et Paso, Texas. He 
was alone in his automobllé, a 1957 Mercury, and travelling around seventy miles
per hour. The radio was tuned to an El Paso, Texas, station, which, according to
SOURCE 7 gave good reception in a rather spotty afees where there an several dead
spots. SOURCE stated that his radio began to fade out: simultaneously his car began
to "slow uf," almost as though it were developing battery truble About this time,
he aoticed about six other cars (oridnatlly reported as ten) which had pulied off
the road; their passengers had disembarked and were pointing skyward. SOURCE follow–
eu 5uit, left his car, and saw en ojes "shaped object in the northrast sky, just below
the Sacramento Mountains. SOURCE does not wear spectacles nor did he observe it
through binoculars. He estimated that it was 35 Brees from the horizon, and about
45 dgress from true North. It appeared to be lustrous, the color of: methercof 
tezau), and with a faint, purptlah thewe; there was fo a ncx or corona. SOURCE stated
that it was brighter than the dull sky background, aithough the brightness did nct
approximately that of an sutomeblle headlight; and that idd its brightness changed.
SOURCE stated that the object appeared to be @ solid, rather than transparent, but
could offer no theory about construction details. SOURCE estimated that the object

appeared to be solid, rather than transparent, but could offer no theory about construction details. SOURCE estimated that the object descended from an altitude of about 5000 feet to between 1500 and 2500 feet, turned west toward the San Andras Mountains, and disappeared at approximately 15 degrees from the horizon, and 270 degrees from true North (Refer to Figure #1). The object appeared to be between three and five miles ahead of the first car parked along the road. Approximately two minutes later, SOURCE observed the object make an identical appearance, although slightly south of the path of the first. SOURCE stated that the object appeared to be about the size of a pea held at arm's length; he stated he believed it to be about 500 feet long; he noticed no ports, heard no sounds, noticed no smoke or vapor trails, and said it was sharply outlined with nothing fuzzy about the silhouette. SOURCE stated that it did not appear to change shape at any time, did not stand still, did not flicker or seem to pulsate. As the object passed, SOURCE noticed a distinct rise in his body temperature, as though he had been exposed to a "giant sun lamp", and later stated that he had incurred a sunburn. (This statement was later retracted). During this time, SOURCE discussed the phenomena with two other motorists, one of whom, as did SOURCE, made notes; the other allegedly took photographs of the object. SOURCE took down the names of these two men, although he neglected to take down the license numbers of their automobiles. A subsequent search for the two men failed to disclose their whereabouts, nor could they be further identified, no other reports of such a sighting were made by anyone else. Although the day was dull with scattered clouds and a 2500 foot broken high overcast, SOURCE stated that he had observed the two flights of the object for a total of three or four minutes; he later estimated the speed of the object to be between 1500 and 2000 miles per hour. SOURCE has never been married. SOURCE stated that his car started again quite easily, although the battery had been steaming.

Imperative:
            did these speeds and for that long time duration through broken clouds or at low levels ?!?!?

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The opinion of the Preparing Officer is that SOURCE possibly witnessed an optical phenomenon for the following reasons:

a. The object does not remotely meet identification criteria for aircraft, balloons, meteors, stars or planets.

b. Although the reported color of the object is consonant with that of ball lightning, the fantastic speed of the unidentified object rules out that possibility.

 c. The reported shape, lack of trail and sound, incredible speed and other reported conditions are in harmony with the theory of an optical illusion.

2. It would be manifestly impossible for SOURCE to have observed the object for as long as he stated if it were traveling at the estimated speed.

3. Due to the flat white sandy terrain, mirages cannot be considered unusual occurrences.

On Monday night, November 4. the Alamogordo, new Mexico, radio station broadcast a dramatic interview with an engineer from

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 69--THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, describing his sighting of an E-M-radiating UFO at least 500 feet long. About one o’clock on Monday afternoon, Mr. X stated, he was returning to base after a weekend in El Paso [4). While driving along a desert stretch of U. S. Highway 54 near the town of Orogrande, he noticed a group of cars stopped ahead of him, their passengers standing in the road, pointing at the sky. Looking up, he saw an iridescent egg-shaped object at least 500 feet long—more than twice the size of the UFOs reported in the preceding two days. As it approached, the flying egg exerted a force that killed the engine of his car, generated a wave of heat that gave him a bad burn, and demonstrated a startling new characteristic: it silenced the radio in his car. (During the next few days, reports of similar encounters usually included a jammed radio.) When the UFO took off toward the mountains and disappeared, Mr. X started his car again and drove on into Alamogordo to the home of a friend, Mrs. Coral Lorenzen.

One of the most zealous amateur investigators of UFO reports, Mrs. Lorenzen had founded the Aerial Phenomena Research Orga- nization (APRO)(see Chapter XIII) in January 1952, and from 1954 to 1956 had been employed at Holloman Air Force Base. After listening to Mr. X’s story and examining the notes he had scribbled during the sighting (unfortunately they proved to be illegible, but for some reason no one has ever suggested that the pen or pencil was also hexed by the UFO), she hurried him down to the local radio station where he made the taped interview that was broadcast later that evening.

A daylight visit by an E-M flying egg some 500 feet long would supposedly have attracted the attention of many witnesses. Air Force investigators could find only one: Mr. X. According to his testimony, the passengers of several automobiles (his estimate of the number of cars varied from time to time but he eventually set- tled on ten) had stood in the road watching the unknown object. A persistent search by Air Force officials failed to locate any one of these persons. The witness showed no sign of the burns he al- legedly suffered. In short, the only evidence to support his story was Mr. X’s own and the authorities sensibly concluded that the incident was either a hoax or a hallucination, inspired by newspaper publicity about Levelland's flying eggs.

Nov. 5-1957
Engineer 'Sunburned'
By Flying 'Thing'

ALAMOGORDO, N.M., Nov.
5 (UP)-An electronics engi-
neer reported seeing an un-
identified flying object on an
isolated desert highway near
Alamogordo in southern New
Mexico yesterday.

James Stokes, 45, an engi-
neer in the geair air research
project in the Air Force Mis-
sile Development Center near
Alamogordo, said 10 or more
automobiles were stopped
when the object appeared yes-
terday afternoon on U.S.
Highway 54, between White
Sands Proving Grounds and
the Air Force Missile Develop-
ment Center.

Mr. Stokes, in a taped inter-
view for station KALG in
Alamogordo, reported the
object approached from the
northeast over the Mescalero
Mountains. He said the first
indication that something was
out of the ordinary was the
gradual fading of the radio in
his automobile.

Then, he said, the car engine
died, and he noticed that sev-
eral other cars on the highway
had stopped also. Stokes said
he noticed that the occupants
were getting out of their cars
and pointing to the sky.

“Looking up,” Mr. Stokes
said in the interview, “I saw a
light-colored, egg-shaped ob-
ject making a shallow dive
across the sky to the northwest.

“Then it wheeled and made
a pass at the highway, across
the road not more than two
miles ahead.

“It then moved away toward
the Organ Mountains near

White Sands Proving Grounds
to the southwest.

“As it passed at its closest
point I could feel a kind of
heat wave, but there was no
sound.

“It had no viable portholes
and there was no vapor trail,
smoke or flame visible.”

Mr. Stokes said he remern-
bered the details precisely be-
cause he pulled out a notebook
and jotted down everything he
saw.)

“When I got back to my car
and checked the engine, I found
it intact, but the battery was
dead. It started with no
trouble and I headed for a
phone to notify officials at the
Air Force Missile Development
Center at Alamogordo.”
(An Air Force public infor-
mation officer told United
Press last night he had no in-
formation to report.)

Mr. Stokes said he noted
later, after he reached home,
that he had a severe sunburn.

CLERGYMAN SEES UFO IN SOUTH PACIFIC

Engineer and Gls Sight
500-Foot 'Flying Saucer'

ALAMOGORDO, N. M., Nov. 5 (UP)—An electronics engineer re-
ported seeing an unidentified flying object near Alagogordo in south-
ern New Mexico yesterday.

James Stokes, 42, an en-
gineer in an upper air-re-
search project at the Air
Force Missile Develop-
ment Center near Alamo-
gordo, said the object ap-
peared yesterday after-
noon on U. S. highway 54,
 between White Sands 
proving grounds and the 
Air Force Missile Develop- 
merit center.

He said the object ap-
peared to be about 500 feet
in length, with a shiny sur-
face like mother of pearl.

Earlier in the day, officials
at White Sands proving
grounds said two Army pa-
is reported seeing a sim-
lar object or objects on Sun—
day.

SEEN IN TEXAS
Reports came Sunday from
Levelland, Tex., of other
UFO’s.

A dispatch from Honolulu
said a number of Fiji Island
natives and a white clergy-
man reported seeing a similar
object let the South Pacific
isles last month, and on
Skies hang the string tie
the week of Oct.13-19,accord-
ing to an official government
report issued, in Suva.

Mr. Stokes, in a taped in-
terview for Terry Clark, news
director 5:t:ation KALG in
Alamogordo,  reported that
the object approached from
the northeast over the Sacra-
mento Mountains. He said
the first Indication that some
thing was out of the ordinary
was a gradual fading of the
radio in his auto.

Then, he said, the car en-
gine died, and he noticed
that several other cars on the
highway had stopped.

EGG-SHAPED
“Looking up,” Mr. Stokes
said, “I saw a light-colored,
egg-shaped object making a
shallow dive across the sky
to the northwest.

"Then it wheeled and made
a pass at the highway, across
 the area not more than two
 miles ahead.

“As it passed at its closest
point I coid feel a kind of
heat wave, but there was no
sound.

“It had no visible portholes
and there was no vapor trail,
smoke or flame visible.”

BATTERY STEAMS
“When I got back to my
car and checked the engine,
I found it intact, but the bat-
tery was steaming. It start-
ed with no trouble and I
headed for a phone to notify
officials at the Air Force mis-
sile development center at
Almogordo.”

Mr. Stokes said he noted,
later, after he reached home,
that he had a severe sunburn.

Officials at White Sands 
proving grounds, where mis 
siles are tested, said two sep- 
»rate military patrols report- 
ed seeing an unidentified  fly- 
ing object or object[s] Sun-
day over an isolated area of
the proving grounds, near
"Trinity” site where the first
atomic bomb was exploded in
19:5.

ALAMOGORDO, N.M., NOV. 5-- (UP)-- AN ELECTRONICS ENGINEER REPORTED
SEEING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT ON AN ISOLATED DESERT HIGHWAY
NEAR ALAMOGORDO IN SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO YESTERDAY.

J.A. STRIPE, 42, AN ENGINEER IN AN UPPER AIR RESEARCH PROJECT
AT THE AIR FORCE MISSILE DEVELOPMENT CENTER NEAR ALAMOGORDO, SAID
10 AUTOMOBILES STOPPED OR WERE STOPPED WHEN THE OBJECT APPEARED
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON ON U.S. HIGHWAY 54, BETWEEN WHITE SANDS
PROVING GROUNDS AND the AIR FORCE MISSILE DEVELOPMENT CENTER.

EARLIER IN THE DAY, OFFICIALS AT WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUNDS SAID
TWO ARMY PATROLS REPORTED SEEING A SIMILAR OBJECT OR OBJECTS ON
SUNDAY.

SIMILAR REPORTS CAME SUNDAY FROM LEVELLAND, TEX.

A DISPATCH FROM HONOLULU SAID A NUMBER OF FIJI ISLAND NATIVES AND
A WHITE CLERGYMAN REPORTED SEEING A SIMILAR OBJECT IN THE SOUTH
PACIFIC SKIES LAST MONTH. THE STRANGE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED FOUR TIMES
THE WEEK OF OCT. 13-19. ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT REPORT
ISSUED IN FIJI. CAPTAIN THE ISLAND GROUP

IN A TAPED INTERVIEW FOR NEWS DIRECTOR AT
STATION KAIG IN ALAMOGORDO, REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT APPROACHED FROM
THE NORTHEAST OVER THE SACRAMENTO MOUNTAINS. HE SAID THE FIRST
INDICATION THAT SOMETHING WAS OUT OF THE ORDINARY WAS A GRADUAL FADING
OF THE RADIO IN HIS AUTOMOBILE.

THEN, HE SAID, THE CAR ENGINE DIED, AND HE NOTICED THAT SEVERAL
OTHER CARS ON THE HIGHWAY HAD STOPPED. STOKES SAID HE NOTICED THAT THE
OCCUPANTS WERE GETTING OUT OF THEIR CARS AND POINTING TO THE SKY.

LOOKING UP, I SAID IN THE INTERVIEW, “I SAW A LIGHT-
COLORED, EGG-SHAPED OBJECT MAKING A SHALLOW DIVE ACROSS THE SKY TO
THE NORHEAST.

THEN IT WHEELED AND MADE A PASS AT THE HIGHWAY, ACROSS THE ROAD
MORE THAN TWO MILES AHEAD.

IT THEN MOVED AWAY TOWARD THE ORGAN MOUNTAINS NEAR WHITE SANDS
PROVING GROUNDS TO THE SOUTHWEST.

AS IT PASSED AT ITS CLOSEST POINT I COULD FEEL A KIND OF HEAT
BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND.

IT HAD NO VISIBLE PORTHOLES AND THERE WAS NO VAPOR TRAIL. SMOKE
OR FLAME VISIBLE.

STOKES SAID HE REMEMBERED THE DETAILS PRECISELY BECAUSE HE PULLED
OUT A NOTEBOOK AND JOTTED DOWN EVERYTHING HE SAW.

WHEN I GOT BACK TO MY CAR AND CHECKED THE ENGINE, I FOUND IT
INTACT, BUT THE BATTERY WAS STAINING. IT STARTED WITH NO TROUBLE
AND I HEADED FOR A PHONETO NOTIFY OFFICIALS AT THE AIR FORCE MISSILE
DEVELOPMENT CENTER AT ALAMOGORDO.

(AN AIR FORCE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER TOLD UNITED PRESS LAST
NIGHT HE HAD NO INFORMATION TO REPORT.)

SAID HE NOTED LATER, AFTER HE REACHED HOME, THAT HE HAD
SEVERE SUNBURN.

HE SAID MOST OF THE MOTORISTS WHO SAW THE OBJECT WERE ENGINEERS
OR TECHNICIANS WHO WORK ON ROCKET PROJECTS AT WHITE SANDS. HE IDENTIFI
TWO OTHERS AT THE SCENE AS OF LAS CRUCES, N.M., AND A
MR. ALSO OF LAS CRUCES.

SAID THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 500 FEET IN LENGTH,
WITH A SHINY SURFACE LIKE MOTHER OF PEARL.

OFFICIALS AT WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUNDS, WHERE MISSILES ARE TESTED,
SAID TWO SEPARATE MILITARY PATROLS REPORTED SEEING AN UNIDENTIFIED
FLYING OBJECT (OR OBJECTS) SUNDAY OVER AN ISOLATED AREA OF THE PROVING
GROUNDS, NEAR TRINITY SITE WHERE THE FIRST ATOMIC BOMB WAS
EXPLODED IN 1945.

THEY INVESTIGATED THE SITE, BUT FOUND NO MARKINGS.
THE HONOLULU REPORT SAID THE FIRST SIGHTING WAS REPORTED

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY 
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY 
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 60201

June 1, 1965

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
Box 9494
FHD Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major: 

This is a report on the very old sighting of November 4, 1957, made by two police officers and a fireman riding in one patrol car at shortly after 3:00 a.m., in Elmwood Park, Illinois.

I monitored the making of this part of the NBC documentary on UFO's, as I did on the previous night at Elk Grove Village, on the evening of May 27, 1965. Fortunately, all three witnesses are still holding down the same jobs, but only two were available for interview on this evening. The names of the witnesses were Officer [redacted], Officer [redacted] and Fireman [redacted].

All men stated that the incident had been reported to [redacted] but that [redacted] had merely said that they had nothing on their screens. Here's another case where [redacted] failed to follow through and report a sighting.

Officer [redacted] was ill on the night of the filming for the documentary, but I did talk at length with Officer [redacted] and with the fireman [redacted]. Both are [redacted]. Before passing any final judgment, I would like to talk with Officer [redacted] if I ever get the chance. If there had been only one witness of the caliber of either of the two I interviewed, I would tend to dismiss the incident as the product of an overwrought imagination. However, with three witnesses, with the two officers being on active duty, I feel that something was definitely sighted. Furthermore, the sighting occurred the day after the Loveland, Texas, cases, and the description is quite similar. However, it was determined that these men had no knowledge of the Loveland sighting of the previous day. They stated that after they came back to the station house at dawn, the morning Tribune had just been delivered, and in thumbing through the pages, they then came across an account of the Loveland sighting. They made a definite point of the surprise with which they met the Texas account.

fireman, while the HIJC people were in the squad car ahead. The officer
and the fireman’s story agreed in the basic account, although they
disagreed somewhat on sizes and on the height at which the object was
observed.

At about 3:00 a.m., a squad car was patrolling the alley-way behind a
row of stores on [REDACTED]. They had proceeded about two blocks
down the alley (the total length of which was nearly a mile), when they
perceived an open window in the back of one of the stores. They stopped
to examine it with their spot light, but just then the spot light and
their head lights dimmed very much, so much so that the officer said that
a match would have been brighter. This being the case, they took a
flashlight from the car and went out to examine the window and to look
under the hood. At this time, they said they noticed a bright spherical
object above and ahead of them. I questioned them very long on the size
and appearance and the best I could get was that it was like an ir-
descent orange beach ball except much larger. The fireman said that
whenever after that he bounced a beach ball, it always brought back
this incident to him. As the object moved down the alley, but above the
alley, the car lights came back on. The engine, however, never had
stalled but kept going the whole time. They trailed the object and
whenever they turned their lights off, the object seemed to hover, and,
so to speak, watch them. As soon as they turned their lights on, the
object moved off.

The men trailed down the alley for fully a half mile to the end of the
alley where it met a cemetery. They paused at the end and turned their
lights off. The object slowly descended and hovered just a few feet
off the ground. Here [REDACTED] kicked on the "brights" and the
object ascended very rapidly fifty or sixty miles an hour!! It also
took off westward. The officers now jogged right for a quarter of a
block to join Belmont Street and pursued the object down Belmont Street.
Here [REDACTED] said that it cavorted from curb to curb back and
forth as though "thplaying games with them". The fireman maintains that
the object was higher up.

The color or brightness never changed throughout the entire episode,
which lasted some ten or fifteen minutes. There is a stand of trees in
the cemetery and alongside Belmont on both sides. The object periodi-
cally became lost behind the trees. After about a mile and a half, they
made a U turn and came back east on Belmont, having lost sight of the
object. As they got back into Elmwood Park, the object approached them
from the left from a stand of trees, passed over them and to the rear.
They made another U turn and pursued the object again westward. Very
soon after this, they said the object ascended to a great height.

Elmwood Park, Ill., Nov. 4, 1957 Sighting

Officer [REDACTED] said to about five thousand (5,000') feet, but this may or may not be the case since I do not particularly rate this judgment about dimensions, or facts for that matter, very high. But both the fireman and the officer agreed that the object disappeared as though a person pulled a black shade up from the bottom, or as though one were filling the spherical object with a black ink. After it disappeared, high in the air in this manner, it did not reappear. Apparently, the only other witness to the incident was a dog which was disturbed and barked at the object somewhere along the route.

The story does not hang together very well. The men are [REDACTED] but they certainly stand to gain nothing from having perpetrated a hoax and, in fact, it could cost them promotions.

The object was described as bright but not hard on the eyes, and very beautiful. After considerable coaxing and trying to get the idea of simulation across, they agreed that if I brought in a balloon painted a bright orange and of a size of about an ordinary room, and held it in the sky, that it would look very much like the object they remembered. It must be remembered that this sighting happened some eight years ago, and memories over that length of time have probably deteriorated considerably.

According to the men, the moon was out that night, but to the east, whereas the object at that same time was toward the west. The sky was basically clear, although there was a fog in the cemetery.

One primary incident occurred when the squad car had stopped at the end of the first long alley just before they jogged on into Belmont Street. The lights were out and the object was descending. At this time, it lost its circular shape and took on a cigar shape surrounded by a fogginess which seemed to emanate from the object itself. There was disagreement as to how much fog, if any, there was in the cemetery that night. The crucial time of the incident seems to have been when the officer kicked on the lights as the object was descending and had assumed a cigar shape. As soon as the lights came on, the object rose up rapidly, resumed its circular shape, and sucked up the fogginess around it.

One other high spot occurred apparently just before the second U turn when the squad car was going east on Belmont. The object came at them from the woods to the left, and according to Officer [REDACTED] came so close to the car that he could have reached out and touched it. The fireman did not agree, feeling that the object had always maintained a respectable distance.

The similarity to the Loveland case is striking and if we can believe (I think we can) that they were unaware of the Loveland sighting at the time they made theirs; it becomes all the more interesting. The object definitely passed in front of objects from time to time and the object could not be seen through the light. The object, or the illumination, was not transparent. 

No sound or noise was ever associated with the object. It seemed to glow and its color was compared by both men to the color of a setting sun, but not as bright. 

It is unfortunate that the incident did not occur to witnesses better trained as observers, and more articulate ones. 

Other small items: _____ said that his "hair stood on end" when he saw the object, and the other officer said _____ wanted to shoot at it, but was cautioned by Officer _____ not to shoot until he knew more about it. 

Meteorological conditions for this night should be checked to be compared with similar data from Loveland. Likewise, comparison should be made with the Lock Raven Dam case and the Swiss equivalent of the Lock Raven Dam case which occurred just two or three days before the Lock Raven Dam case. 

I would recommend that all cases of luminous globes of light which apparently do not appear to be attached to a tangible object be collected and be examined for similarities of behavior and ambient conditions. We may have here, and I say just possibly may, have an indication of something new in atmospheric physics. Cases should be limited, however, to more than one-witness cases. 

This case should not be closed until I have a chance to talk with _____ . I have a feeling that he may provide something which will either strongly corroborate the above or throw it out of court. 

Sincerely,

No Case (Information Only)

4 November 1957
Chicago (Elmwood Park), Ill.

About 3:15 a.m. on November 4th came a report from suburban Chicago: three Elmwood Park police officers and a fireman saw a low-hovering 200-foot cylindrical object, red-orange in color, above a nearby cemetery; they said it appeared to be "folding into itself" until they threw their prowl car searchlight on it, at which time it began "puffing out." At this point, the searchlight dimmed and almost went out. The object began moving off in a westerly direction and although the men tried to follow it in their car, it quickly disappeared from view--by "folding into itself."

Dear Mr [REDACTED]

     This is to acknowledge your letter of 1 August 1959 con-
cerning various UFO sightings.

     Research of Air Force records indicates that the 9 November
1957 sighting you mention has never been reported to the U.S.
Air Force

     The 5 November 1957 Coast Guard sighting was evaluated as
several aircraft on the radarscope.

     The 24 February 1959 American Air Lines sighting was
attributed to jet night aerial refueling operations. The Pacific
sightings of 17 July 1959 were attributed to an exceptionally
bright and large meteor called "Fireball"

                                                                           Sincerely,

9 September 1960

Office of Information Services
Department of the Air Force
226 W. Jackson Blvd.
Chicago, Illinois

Gentlemen:

I have been trying to learn the conclusions by the Air Force of two sightings of unidentified flying objects in this area.

Correspondence with Lt. Col. L.J. Tacker, Office of Information, Washington, has brought a statement that they were not reported to the Air Force at ATIC. Since the sightings were reported to officials at O'Hare AFB, an identification must have been made by these officials, thereby ending the necessity of forwarding the reports to ATIC (as per AFR 200-2, section 9).

If, however, they were not identified and not reported, this would constitute a violation of AFR 200-2, section 4, paragraph 2.

Information regarding these sightings follows:

(a) 4 Nov 1957 - Elmwood Park, Ill.--early morning. Two policemen and a fireman in a patrol car saw and attempted to follow a red-orange object that, at times, manuevered at low altitudes. At one time, the lights on the patrol car dimmed, apparently due to the presence of the object. This object was immediately reported to O'Hare AFB and the witnesses were questioned by Air Force officers.
 
(b) 19 Jul 1958 - Des Plaines, Ill.--early morning. Three men at corner of Lee & Algonquin, Des Plaines, saw a bright red object pass overhead, silently, hover momentarily over O'Hare, then take off at very high speed. Sighting was reported to Des Plaines Police at 0345 hrs., 19 July. (Record Bureau Number 31335). The following day, one witness contacted O'Hare and reported the sighting. The Des Plaines Journal also contacted Air Force officials.

I would like to know the official conclusion in these cases in accordance with AFR 200-2, section 9.

Respectfully yours;

(redacted)

8 September 1959

Dear Mr.

This is in regard to your letter of 4 September concerning UFO sightings in the Chicago area.

As stated in my previous letter, neither of the sightings you refer to (Elmwood Park, Illinois and O'Hare Air Force Base) were reported to the Air Technical Intelligence Center. Since neither of these sightings were reported to ATIC, they must have been positively identified as familiar objects by the Commander of O'Hare Air Force Base when they were reported to that installation. This is in accordance with paragraph 9 of AFR 200-2.

In this case, it is not essential that the report be presented to ATIC. Suggest you contact the O'Hare Information Office with respect to these two sightings.

 Dear Mainr Ticain:
 
 In your letter to me dad Sept, 2, 1959 regarding four UFO
 sightings, you said that a UFO sighting 
 occurred in Elmtwood Puli, Fill. on Nov. 1, 1957 was newer
 reported to the USPT.
 
 For your information, two U.S. Air Force officers, in unifrom,
 questioned o began one of the three tvitnesses after one of them
 called O'Hare Air .Force Race. The witnesses were also quoted
 in local WET A mticles.
 
 On Feb. 12, 1959, you note to me that a sighting occurring at
 O'Hare AIY had newer been reported.
 
 The local newspaper (the Des Moinew Journal) and one of the
 witnesses called the Air Force Base about the sighting.
 
 Now, one of two things are happending.
 
 Either you, or your source of information, is holding cut on
 the general public. Lima this is so, it may be necessary to in-
 form one or more of the Illinois Cnngressmen in the future in
 order to obtain more informntion.
 
 The other possibility is , that somehow at O'Hare is not forward-
 ing reports to ATIC at Dayton, thereby violating AFI 200-2.
 
 (Section A, eubsection 4, paragraph a Reporting: reader Com-
 manders of Air Force bases will report all information and evi-
 dence of UFO sightings, including those received from other ser-
 vices, Government agencies, and civil air sources.")
 
 I have :heryo tried to cc,co_perate vdth the AU` Force by report-
 ing orthin A happen to observe and I think it is only fair
 that the Air Force try to co-operate a little morc with the pub-
 lic.

Dear Major Coleman:

On 10 June 1961, at your request, I sent you information regarding 
a sighting of an unidentified flying object over Rushville, Nebraska early 
in January, 1951 I would appreciate knowing, in accordance with AFR 200-2 
section 8, the outcome of the official study into this sighting.

Would you please send my a copy of the latest DDD News Release on the 
subject?

On 7 August 1961, I requested information regarding two Chicago-area 
sightings. (4 Nov 57, Elmwood Park; 19 Jul 58, Des Plaines, Ill.) I have been 
trying to obtain inform at about these incidents for over a year. If I can-
not get it through normal channels, I may be forced to seek assistance, as 
I have done before.

On 11 September 1961, I requested information regarding a series of
UFO reports (30 Aug 61; 5 Sep 61) over Cincinnati, Ohio. I would like to
learn the official conclusion in this case, in accordance with AFR 200-2,
section 8.

Major, I have a considerable amount of patience and I feel you are 
competent for the work you are doing. I hope you will provide the informa-
tion requested, thereby insuring also that both these characteristics will 
remain unchanged.

             $incerely:

In an earlier letter I replied to you concerning the sighings you mentioned in previous correspondence.

 Venus Most Prominent

 Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars."

 By JAMES STOKLEY

 THAT BRILLIANT object you see in the southwestern sky these evenings as darkness falls is not an airplane, a flying saucer, or some bright light hung in the sky as part of an experiment.

 What you see is the planet Venus, now reaching its greatest prominence, which comes just before its disappearance from the evening sky early in 1958.

 Venus is far brighter than any other star or planet seen in the night sky and there is no difficulty in identifying it. Indeed, it can be observed long before the sky is dark. In fact, if you know where to look, you can even see it in broad daylight!

 After it passed behind the sun last April 14, Venus has gradually been drawing it farther eastward from the sun It will wait

This constellation represents the Ethiopian Princess who, according to mythology, was chained to a rock to be devoured by a sea monster, represented by the constellation of Cetus, the whale, in the southern sky. Fortunately, she was rescued by her hero, Perseus, who is seen in the northeast.

 Andromeda's mother, Cassiopeia, is seen in the north, a group forming the letter M, above Polaris, the pole star. Alongside her in her husband the king.

 Turning now toward the east, we can see what is generally considered to be the finest constellation in the sky making its debut for the season.

 Orion: Season's Finest

 This is Orion, the warrior, easily recognized because of the three stars in a row that form his belt. To the left is Betelgeuse, to the right is Rigel, both of the first magnitude, although being so low in the sky they do not appear as bright as they will in the coming months. Then you will see them high in the south.

ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGY

Worms Learn Best in Evening Hours

A WORM can be taught to turn in a special direction, but its learning ability is at its best in the evening hours. At least this was found true for one particular kind of earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris, Dr. Jack Ardit of the U. S. Army Leadership Human Research Unit, Fort Ord, Calif., reports in Science (Oct. 4).

The worm was taught by a system of reward for correct turning or punishment if it went the wrong way. When the worm turned the right way, it found its reward at the end of a path, a box covered with moist earth and moss in a baker covered with paper to make it dark. When it turned in the wrong direction it was punished by having to crawl over sandpaper and if it persisted in crawling the wrong way it received a mild electric shock.

If the worm failed to move at all, it was urged into action by a gentle tickling with a scientist's hair paintbrush. If that did not get it started, a flashlight was turned on and held shining just behind it.

The worm was considered to have "passed" on the course if it reached the moist earth without being shocked seven consecutive times.

The worms who did their lessons in the evening between 8 p.m. and midnight learned in an average of 32 tries. The morning class, between 8 a.m. and noon, required 45 tries.

TECHNOLOGY

Radar Sets Can Be "Blinded" 

A COUNTER-MEASURE to radar detection--to "blind its eye"--has been discovered by a British firm. It offers the first possibility that radar warning defense can be defeated, whether the attack is made by bombers or guided missiles.

The new material includes foam rubber panels, rubber sheets bonded to brass and ceramics.

It is claimed that using the material provides new standards of navigational safety to aircraft and shipping by eliminating unwanted radar reflections. Successful tests have already been made on ships' funnels and airport buildings. The structures covered with the material become invisible to a radar beam.

The Plessy Company technicians, developers of the material, explain that the new material cuts the radar pulses off at a critical moment. Instead of bouncing back to the expectant receiver, they are absorbed by the 
Biochemist 
Secret of Aspirin's Action is Revealed

ASPIRIN, the most familiar drug in mankind's medicine chest, goes to work when the pituitary gland changes it into an oxidized compound known as gentisic acid, Prof. John E. Christian and Ross Crabtree of the Purdue University School of Pharmacy have found.

They also knew that gentisic acid has the same effect on aspirin, minus aspirin's toxicity. They also knew that when sensitive patients and others who take large doses of aspirin excrete more gentisic acid than normal people do. So they devised an experiment to discover whether gentisic acid in a breakdown product of aspirin and where this process takes place.

First they induced fever in rats by feeding them aspirin labeled with carbon-14 into the rats' pituitary gland, the body's "master gland," they found gentisic acid. It was labeled with carbon-14. In none of the other organs with a solution product of benzoic and salicylic acids, or aspirin. It is less toxic than aspirin because of the addition of a hydroxyl group.

The pituitary gland contains large amounts of Vitamin C, which is an oxidizing agent. Further, the pituitary gland is the control center in the posterior portion of the hypothalamus.

These findings have led the Purdue scientists to believe that a modified gentisic acid might possibly prove even more useful and safe than aspirin itself.

PHYSICS

Magnetic Phenomenon Yields "Super Magnets"

EXPERIMENTAL magnets with "one track minds" promise to be the first real permanent magnets. They will resist having their magnetic alignment taken away by every new electric magnet puttern.

The new magnets are made by placing an oxide coating over very small particles of magnetic material such as cobalt metal. The particles, when soaked together at low temperatures in a strong magnetic field, form a very powerful magnet that cannot be degaussed by another magnetic field working against the first.

The new magnets exhibit the phenomenon of "exchange anisotropy," promising effects never before seen in permanent magnets. The use of this new magnet was discovered in the 40 years, and it came from discoverer of the giant magnetic substances, William H. Meiklejohn of the General Electric Research Laboratory, Schenectady, N.Y. Anisotropy is an effect in magnets that causes them to have the alignment of magnetization in the oxide of two metals particles, with the unaffered by magnetic fields.

At present, Mr. Meiklejohn is working on making materials which promise as anisotropic substances, and hopes that they will exhibit exchange anisotropy at room temperature or higher.

SEISMOLOGY

Earthquakes Show Ocean Floor Differences

THE DISASTROUS earthquakes in Turkey last April have given scientists new knowledge of the result of the earth under the Mediterranean Sea, it is indicated in a report to Nature (Oct. 12).

The earthquake waves picked up on the seismograph at Kivu Livrio in the Belgian Congo show the structure of the sea bottom in different in sections found off Turkey from the south of Greece. D. I. C.I. Le Brasseur of the Institut pour la Recherche Scientifique en Afrique Centrale at Kivu Livrio reports.

Study of earthquake waves at sea in this region is urged by Dr. Le Brasseur. The exact nature of the differences observed could have important implications for our knowledge of the structure of the earth, he says.

The moon will be just past last quarter, rising around midnight, so its light may interfere a little with the meter display, although not as much as if there were a full moon.
Around 2:00 a.m., perhaps, a dozen of these meteors may be seen an hour, appar ently radiating from a point in the eastern sky in the constellation of Leo, the Lion. Because of this, the shower is known as the Leonids.
Actually the meteors are moving in a great circular swarm around the sun, which 
the earth crosses at this time of year, so their motion is parallel. The effect of seem ing to radiate from Leo is one of perspec tive. Their tracks converge in the distance, like the parallel tracks of a railroad.
Meteors Come in Cycles
These meteors take about 33 years to en circle the sun, and at one point they are much more numerous than elsewhere. In 1833 and 1866 the earth encountered this concentration and there was a brilliant dis play, with meteors seemingly coming down almost like snowflakes.
By the next two times around, in 1899 and 1932, the dense cluster had been switched aside because of the gravitational attraction of Jupiter as it had passed near it. In these years, instead of a good display, the Leonid meteors were quite poor.
Despite the bombardment of the earth by these, and other meteor showers, the meteors do not reach the ground. They are tiny things, no larger than pinheads, and are completely burned by friction as they en counter the resistance imposed by the earth's atmosphere.
There also are stray meteors, not con nected with any regular showers. Once in a while these are large enough to survive the passage through the atmosphere. One of the largest meteorites discovered is that found, along with two smaller ones, in Greenland in 1894. It measures 11 by 7 by 5 feet and weighs 36.5 tons.
