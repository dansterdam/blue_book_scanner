There is no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. The image contains a "PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD" with various fields filled out, including the location (Forbes AFB, Kansas), date (12 Sept 1962), and a description of the observed object as "a bright meteor only orange in color descending in escalating movement sound. Described as about brightness of a star from ground level, elevation after 5 minute observation."

The text of the document is as follows:

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed report or document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s and 1960s. The document describes an observation of a meteorological phenomenon, possibly a bright meteor or fireball, that occurred at 10,220 feet altitude and was visible for 9 miles. The report was prepared by 2/Lt John K. Horn of the 42nd Bomb Wing, and it is dated 13/11/52.

TEXT OF THE DOCUMENT:
52222 - 16 DEGREES CENTIGRADE 
52222 - NOT AVAILABLE
CLOUD COVER WAS SCATTERED AT 10220 FEET, VISIBILITY 9 MILE-
H. POSSIBLE EXPLANATION: CONSIDERING THAT METEOROIDS HAD ALREADY
BEEN SIGHTED, THIS WAS PROBABLY JUST AN UNUSUALLY BRIGHT ONE-
THIS IN LIGHT COULD HAVE BEEN MAGNIFIED IN THE AIRMAN'S MEMORY.
THE FACT OF THE YELLOW-ORANGE COLOR MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONLY CHEMICALS IN
THE METEOR.
