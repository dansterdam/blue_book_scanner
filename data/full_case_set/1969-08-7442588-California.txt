SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE
This questionnaire has been prepared so that you can give the U.S. Air Force as much information as possible about any sightings of unidentified flying objects which you may have made.
[Various questions about the sighting]
DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENON 
the object, the time zone, the amount of time the object was observed, and the sighting location.
California San Pedro California - Date 1969

The object was first seen at 8:22 A.M. and disappeared from view at 8:24 A.M. It was spotted in the sky near the horizon, and the witness observed it for approximately 2 minutes. The diagram shows the trajectory or path of the observed object.

This image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains two illustrations:

1. The larger illustration is a compass-like diagram with various directional labels. This appears to be some kind of visual aid or reference for describing the orientation and movement of a reported UFO sighting.

2. The two smaller illustrations at the bottom depict a person standing in a landscape, with what appears to be a distant object or phenomenon visible in the sky.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

CALIFORNIA

ENCOUNTER - 7 AUGUST 1969

WITNESS: Mr. Smith (pseudonym)

LOCATION: Near Los Angeles, California

DATE: 7 August 1969

TIME: Approximately 2030 hours

SIGHTING DETAILS:

Mr. Smith, en route home from work, observed a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to be moving erratically, rapidly accelerating and decelerating. Mr. Smith stopped his car to observe the light more closely. As he watched, the light appeared to split into several smaller lights that scattered in different directions before rejoining into a single, larger light. This sequence was repeated several times over the course of 10-15 minutes. Mr. Smith was unable to determine the nature or origin of the lights.
