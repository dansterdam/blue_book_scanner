Text from the document:

Country: Chile
Report No. IR-42-50
AP-16500-1
Subject: Flying Discs
From: Air Attache, Chile
Date of Information: Current
Evaluation: F-0 
Prepared by: Harry L. Mitchell, Major, USAF
Sources: Newspaper reports and personal observations of Air Attache Office personnel.

1. Flying discs are being "seen" in various parts of Chile. First sighting was in the Punta Arenas, Lat 53°06'S, Long 70°53'W on 11 Mar at noon. Many inhabitants of the city reported seeing a disc-shaped object which appeared northwest of the city and traveled toward the southwest. Usual description was given - extreme altitude, silver in color, shaped like a ping-pong ball. 
2. Sighting of a disc took place in the Santiago area, San Bernardo and Valparaiso on the 24th and 25th of March with the usual description given by the populace being quoted in the local press.
3. Third sighting of a disc occurred 28 March between 1330 and 1.10 over Santiago, Chile. Downtown area was crowded with people looking into the sky, observing this phenomenon. Diagram attached to this observation as in 2. above.

COMMENT: On 29 March this observer saw a silver colored, stationary object in the same relative position as was witnessed by the local inhabitants the preceding day, and after careful observation concluded it to be the planet Venus and not a flying disc.

Professor Rutland (par 1) repeated his statement to the local press that what the inhabitants had seen was the planet Venus.
