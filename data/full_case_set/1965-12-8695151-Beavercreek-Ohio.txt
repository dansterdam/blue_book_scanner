The image does not contain any photograph, it is a technical diagram with instructions and questions related to the sighting of a UFO or unidentified object above the horizon.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

The text found in the document is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 
    Day   Month   Year
        8      12     1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sightings.
        I saw what appeared to be a very bright and silver object move rapidly overhead accompanied by a pulsating reddish orange light. It moved in a very erratic manner, making abrupt turns and changes of speed. I was able to observe it for approximately two minutes before it disappeared behind some trees. The object appeared to be saucer shaped and emitted no sound. I have seen similar objects on two other occasions in this area that have displayed identical characteristics. I feel that this information is important and should be included in the record.
