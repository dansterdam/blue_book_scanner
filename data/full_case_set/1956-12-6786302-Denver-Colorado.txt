31 December 1956
Washington Heights, N.Y.C.

December 14, 1956. A person, who lives in Washington Heights, N.Y.C., noticed an exceptionally bright light, which appeared to be about the size of a basketball, hovering at 11:15 p.m. above the Hudson River. The object appeared at the window, which faces north and commands an unobstructed view of the Hudson River. The object appeared motionless with a faint tinge of green. Its size remained constant and there was no noise or sound associated with it. The object finally disappeared, inclining slightly upward, at the same horizontal angle, without any apparent change in the brightness of the light.

When first seen, the object appeared to be directly over the river, north of the Washington Bridge. According to the observer, it was hovering at about twice the speed of an airliner as it passes over the same area at a normal altitude. Its elevation was thought to be about 500-600 feet above the Jersey Palisades. After it hovered for a short time, the object slowed down, "like the closing down of a camera diaphragm", and finally disappeared, going in the same horizontal direction but inclining upward.

When the object first appeared, the light was very bright, but the brightness of the light was noted through the window until the object finally disappeared; the object itself was under good observation for about four to five seconds. No other reports.

The resemblance to the - - - - - - object will be noted.

Case 277, Baltimore, Md. Dec. 3, 1956--Quoting the Baltimore Sun, "Two men reported they saw a flying object streak away from a large transport plane while they were standing at Charles and Centre Streets. Curvin A. Ball and Robert Bryant, guards at the Walters Art Gallery, said, 'We thought at first the tail of a section of a plane had broken loose. But then the plane reversed it, and we saw the thing.' They said the object was 'flat, oval-shaped and very bright.' It appeared to be spinning counterclockwise. They said they watched it until it disappeared behind a building..."

Witness (Clark) Sighter... former Marine pilot, saw 2 flying objects, very fast, heading north, saw no sound. Other apparent similar objects were seen. Two objects at appear steady moving faster than a jet. They dove and also seemed to pulsate. This would make the objects hard to track, course until it disappeared is uncertain, according to witness. Entire incident, according to Herbert Clark, "from what I could gather, was over in 6 to 8 seconds". Comments from the witness seemed reliable.
