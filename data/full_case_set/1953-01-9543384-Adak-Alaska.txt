OBJ WAS REFERRED TO AS A METEOR OR FALLING STAR, AND THAT HE HAD SIMILAR VISUAL APPEARANCE TO THAT, THOUGHT IT COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN AN AIRCRAFT OF SOME SORT, WITH OF COURSE, UNUSUAL MANEUVERING CHARACTERISTICS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF SOUND OR TRAIL OR SMOKE AND IT WAS SIMPLY A BRIGHT ILLUMINATION WHICH SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR INTO A CLOUD BANK. SINCE OBJ WAS ONLY SIGHTED FOR ABOUT 2-3 SECONDS, THERE WAS REALLY NO OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ANY DETAILED OBSERVATION. 
IT IS POSSI8ILITY EXISTS THAT OBJ WAS A UAFC, WHICH TERMINOLOGY - UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL FLYING CRAFT - SEEMS TO BE MORE APPLICABLE THAN UFO, SINCE UNIDENTIFIABLE MEANS EXACTLY THAT, RATHER THAN IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT ITSELF AS NECESSARILY EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL.

SUBJECT: REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS 
NEAR ADAK, ALASKA

1. It is believed that the object described in the inclosed report ia not aimilar to any normal or known aircraft. The report atatea that the object was observed by two Airmen in the air Traffic Control Tower at Adak, Alaska at about 2300 hours on 13 January 1S53.

2. Subject object was observed for about 15 minutes and appeared to be approximately ten miles distant from the observers. It was described as a large luminous object which appeared to change in shape from round to oblong, and which maneuvered in the sky without sound. It then disappeared behind the mountains.

3. This information report, due to the fact that it is unconfirmed except by the two observers, must be considered unreliable and inconclusive. However, since it la the only incident reported from this area recently, it is forwarded for your information.
