The image contains a photograph depicting a news article or report about a sighting of a "soaring space saucer" by swimmers in Bloomingburg, New York on a Sunday evening. The article describes the sighting by two teenagers, Judy Shaver and Nancy Morros, who were swimming and saw a "big bright thing" in the sky. The article mentions that the object was "very bright, unidentified flying object" that was moving and ascending upwards. No human faces are visible in the image.

BLOOMINGBURG - A flying saucer of the sky was sighted Sunday evening over Bloomingburg's sun-drenched swimming pools, Judy Shaver, 13, and Nancy Morros, 11, were swimming in the pools behind their homes report time, "We looked at the sky and saw a big bright thing," Nancy called to Judy in the water. However, Nancy said, she told Judy the object it was moving too fast for the girls to follow with their eyes.

The very bright, unidentified flying object ascended swiftly, then veered sharply to the right, and went speeding off into space.

Afterwards, the girls said, they did not report their strange sighting immediately because, they worried people would not believe them.

When Judy's family told her mother, Mrs. Glenford Shaver, about the sighting, she answered "Uh, sure, you say one of them,"

A spokesman at Wurtsburg Airport at Stewart Air Force Base, declined to comment, except to say that whatever the girls had seen could not be traced for comments.

Transcribed text:

3ir:
Enclosed please find the recording tape involving the Unidentified Flying Object incident at Bloomingburg, New York. I add this to the correspondence, and I sincerly hope that it will be of some value for what it is worth.

Several rather obscure, perhaps, items are as follows:

Nancy Porrow stated that she related the incident to her shortly afterwards, while the paper (maileto) Record) quotes her as stating the other man (#####) was the first to relate the incident.

The girls said that they believed that the object was a 'Flying Saucer'. I know that they were perhaps a bit forestighted, but since the Air Force classifies UFO's as simply Unknown, I didn't want to disillusion them.

But I am enclosing you this tape, these two girls are purely innocent of any hoax. They're both two sweet kids, without mischievous intentions.

As stated in my conclusions of the tape, should the Air Force send out an investigator, I believe he should ask both the cloud cover conditions and my part. If it had been near the object it might have been of big influence on any conclusions.

I hereby turn all rights of the tape to the United States Air Force so do as they wish with it.

I also hope the the Air Force will contact me on any stated on the tape that is puzzling so I can assist on any relative issue.

Sincerely

This page of the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) incident that occurred in Bloomingburg, New York.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Enclosed please find the recording tape involving an unidentified flying object incident at Bloomingburg, N.Y. I feel that it is reasonably accurate, and I sincerely hope that it will be of some value for what it is worth.

Several months ago, the person, item A, stated that she sighted the incident to the Middletown Record. Shortly afterwards, while the paper (Middletown Record) quotes her as stating that the older girl, item B, was the first to relate the incident.

The letter states that they believed that the object was a "Flying Saucer". It was stated that they were positive it was not any hoax. The author states that since the Air Force classifies UFOs as "Unknowns", they didn't want to delude them.

The author concludes by requesting that the Air Force contact them regarding any stated or relative issue on the tape, which they found puzzling.
