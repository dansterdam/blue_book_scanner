If you would complete the enclosed AF Form 164 on your case and in addition provide the following ancillary data, it will be greatly appreciated:

a. Type of camera.
b. Type of film.

Proposed reply to letter from John Zoppi, 28 January 1967

Dear Mr. _____,

Reference your letter of 28 January 1967 regarding your photograph of an alleged unidentified flying object on the night of 17 January 1967. Without substantial data and additional information on the sighting, a meaningful analysis is not in order. In spite of the information which you submitted, it is impossible for you to have seen Jupiter, Mars, and Venus at the same time. As an amateur astronomer, I am sure you are well acquainted with the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac. According to the text, on 17 January 1967, Venus set at approximately 6:00 P.M. EST, Mars rose at approximately 11:50 P.M. EST, while Jupiter rose at 5:30 P.M. EST. Thus it would have been impossible for you to have seen the three planets at the same time, a mistake on your part, I am sure.

If you would complete the enclosed PFJD Form 164 on your sighting and in addition provide the following camera data, a detailed study will be made. The camera data necessary is as follows:

a. Type of camera
b. Type of film
c. Focal length of camera
d. Lens manufacturer

Dear Sir:

On the night of January 7, 1967
I was out studying weather conditions and
for I got an amateur astronomer. The moon
was just about full on the night of the
the sighting. I went up to the moon and
I saw this object above and to the right
of the moon. I quickly ran inside and got
my telescope and opened the shutter and
plotted before it went away, seeing an
amateur astronomer you can not give me the
explanation that it was a star or planet.
The planet Jupiter was in the east, Mars
was in the south and Venus was in the
west. Please send me an explanation.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
