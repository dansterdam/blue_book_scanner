Here is the text from the document:

DID THE PHENOMENON:
STAND STILL AT ANYTIME?
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
BREAK UP IN PARTS AND EXPLODE? 
CHANGE COLOR?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS?
CHANGE IN SIZE?
FLASH OR FLICKER?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?
MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE? 
MAKE A NOISE?
LEAVE ANY VISIBLE TRAIL?

14. WHAT DID YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON? IT WAS SO BRILLIANT, LARGE, AND DOSE CLOSE TO BE THE BIGGEST OBJECT I HAVE EVER SEEN AND IT WAS APPROACHING ME RAPIDLY UNTIL IT SEEMED TO FILL MY ENTIRE FIELD OF VISION.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR? IT FIRST SEEMED TO VANISH.

DO THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? IT WAS BEHIND SOME TREETOPS TO BEGIN SHORTLY AFTER I FIRST SIGHTED IT.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a blank space with instructions for the witness to "Draw a picture that will show the shape of the phenomenon" and provide details about the movement and appearance of the observed object. The document appears to be a form or report from Project Blue Book, likely used to collect information about alleged UFO sightings.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED IN THE DESCRIPTION SUCH AS THE SPEED, SIZE, SPEED RATE, DISTANCE FROM OBSERVER, ANGLE FROM HORIZON, COLOR, OR OTHER DETAILS THAT INDICATE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

WAS ASKED TO ANGULAR SIZE - HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT OR TREE. ESTIMATE ANGLE COVERED BY OBJECT. THIS IS SOMETIMES CALLED "MATCHING BY THE HEAD". THIS WILL GIVE SOME IDEA OF THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT AS SEEN BY THE OBSERVER.

Last night (January 21) my wife and I were driving home from a party about 10 miles south of Andrews, S.C. It was about 9:30 p.m. when we saw what appeared to be a light colored object, orange in color, and very bright. It was motionless at first, then started moving at a high rate of speed north, then west to east. It was higher than the average plane, and it only lasted for about 5 miles. It seemed to rise in the sky as it moved east. Seconds later it was gone from sight. It was not a reflection and was not a star or plane, as the movement and characteristics were quite different. There was no sound came from it.
