Text output from the OCR:

An unidentified flying object was reportedly observed over Pennsylvania on November 7, 1957. According to the report, the object was sighted by a private pilot, who described it as a strange metallic object hovering at a high altitude. The pilot stated that the object was approximately 50-100 feet in diameter and was observed for several minutes before it accelerated and disappeared from sight. The report includes the pilot's sketch of the object, which shows a circular, metallic-looking craft. The case was investigated by the U.S. Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, but no definitive conclusion was reached about the nature of the object.

SEPTEMBER AUROFAE
BEING the most september, visual occurence observed in the U.S. during september as reported in the sky survey published by the geophysical division, U.S. Air Force:
Luminous areas of the sky seen in the northeast and north, rapidly changing in form and brightness, extending 70 degrees up the sky and northeast. The display lasted from 8:30 to 11:00 p.m. EST. Green, yellow, and violet colors were observed. The luminous areas pulsed and flickered, and changed rapidly in form. Seen in Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Reports indicate the display was exceptionally brilliant and extensive, covering a wide area of the northern sky. The phenomenon is described as "the most spectacular display in that area this year". Observers compared it to the northern lights, but described it as more brilliant and extensive.
