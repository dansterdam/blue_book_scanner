RECOMMENDATIONS

1. That the investigation and study of reports of unidentified
flying objects be reduced in scope.
     a. That current collection directives relative to unidentified
flying objects be revised to provide for the submission of only
those reports clearly indicating realistic technical applications.

2. That Conclusions 1 and 2 of this report, with sufficient supporting data, be declassified and made public in the form of an official press release.

3. That psychological Warfare Division and other governmental
agencies interested in psychological warfare be informed of the results of this study.

4. That such agencies coordinate in and provide further recommendations for public release of material as recommended in Para. 2 above.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #50, 50a - - Wildwood, New Jersey - - 10 January 1948

In view of the unbalanced character of at least one of the observers (as indicated by the report of the interview), this investigator wonders how much credence can be given to the reports of the object or objects cited. For instance, the summary states that the first object was in sight 3-5 seconds, while the interview indicates 15-20 minutes. Assuming that this first incident was authentic and the shorter time correct (it evidently being the estimate given by the second observer), there is nothing in the evidence that is contradictory to the notion that the object observed was nothing more than a slow-moving fireball. The color, splitting into two pieces, and manner of disappearance all support this view.

Incident #01 -- Oswego, Oregon -- 3 September 1947

The limited information given here does not suggest anything astronomical.

It is surprising that there was only one witness to this incident, since it occurred in a city, at a time when there was a plane in the sky.

If these objects were not ordinary aircraft at a great distance, or a cluster of balloons, then the incident must be considered together with others reporting groups of unidentified round or discoid objects, several of which occurred in this locality (e.g., Incidents r-5-9, 12-1C).

Incident No. 2 -- Hamilton Field, California -- 29 July 1947

The objects observed here were almost certainly not
astronomical; although their speed, size, and manner of dis-
appearance might tend to the aircraft hypothesis. The lack
of trail and the "tactics" pursued by the second object make
the likelihood of that interpretation very slight; however,
the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out if considerable
allowance is made for looseness in reporting.

There appears to be nothing astronomical about this incident. According to the observer, the objects had a speed of 285 
mii and were moving on a course of 120°. Now, since the plane was moving at 295 mi/i on a course of 300°, it is possible that the ob-
served motion of the objects was only apparent (since 180° plus 120° 
equals 300°), and we can conjecture that a cluster of balloons (cosmic 
ray apparatus perhaps) was observed, the motion of which was merely 
a reflection of the motion of the plane.

Incident #855 - Harmon Field, Newfoundland - 25 July 1947

If proper allowance is made for the reporting of untrained
observers, it is possible that the objects observed in this incident
were a minor meteor shower.  The "reddish flashes of light" and
"abrupt darts" would tend to this interpretation. The hypothesis
flashes were observed for three minutes." If this means independent
flashes, it lends support to the meteoric interpretation. If it
means that the same objects flashed intermittently for three minutes,
that theory is ruled out. It seems more probable in view of the
statement about "abrupt darts of light" that this former meaning is
correct.

There is somewhat more evidence in this incident than in
#857 (which is similar, and occurred just three days earlier) favoring
meteors, but probably the events of these two incidents are related,
and it is very unlikely that meteors could explain both of them.

According to the report of the U. S. Weather Bureau on
ball lightning, it would appear that this phenomenon sometimes takes
the form of luminous darts and can be red. Perhaps this could offer
an alternate explanation for the incident.

simply as rockets! "Vertical ascent," "Travelled in arc." Data is
too meager for a definite conclusion, however.

If the photograph is authentic, it would be extremely
valuable to know the shutter speed at which it was taken, since from
this the angular velocity could be determined.

This incident and #66, which occurred in the same vicinity

In both cases, information is so meager, and in both cases the
meteoric hypothesis cannot be completely ruled out, but the objects
could have been rockets or even freakish auroral streamers or brush
discharge from ionized dust clouds. In any event, it seems unlikely,
although it is not impossible, that the objects seen in this inci-
dent were meteors. The even spacing of the flashes argues strongly
against the meteoric hypothesis.

Incident #59 -- beyond Wicker Island -- 12 September 1947

From the evidence at hand, it appears quite likely that

change course abruptly when splitting. The reported change to red-
dish hue from the previous color of incandescent light, the length
of time in sight, and the manner of disappearance all tend support
to this hypothesis. At sunset one can expect relatively slow-
moving, nearly horizontal fireballs.

FACTUAL DATA

I. Foreign Reports

During the summer of 1946, there were reported to have been
seen in Sweden a number of mysterious aerial objects. There were as
many different descriptions for the "ghost rockets" as the newspapers
tagged them, as there were observers. It soon became quite common for
newspapers in Sweden and in the U.S. to refer authoritatively to these 
objects as guided missiles with the inference that they were test
flights from Russia or Russian-dominated areas. The "ghost rockets"
were usually seen in hours of darkness, almost always traveling at ex-
tremely high speed, shaped like a ball or projectile; bright or lum-
inescent blue, white, red, green, or yellow; sometimes had an associated
roaring and sometimes not. From two Swedish reports both observed in
May, the end of the season, 1946, an occasional report came out of Den-
mark, Norway, Spain, Greece, F.F. Morocco, Portugal, and Turkey.
Throughout 1947 and 1948, "ghost rocket" reports totalled less than
dozen. None have been received within the past 6 months. These reports
reached the public through the press and the radio, they reached the
Government of the U.S. through Military Attache reports. Attaches had
obtained virtually all of their information from European press and
radio items.

The Swedish Defense Staff conducted a comprehensive study of
the early incidents. Several thousand reports were thoroughly investi-
gated and plotted, with resultant conclusions that all evidence obtained
of sightings were explicable in terms of astronomical phenomena. Since
that time, through the Swedes to the U.S threw little or no publicity
attempt to play up their findings to the United States, obviously to
emphasize their request for radar (see Appendix "A").

II. Early American Reports

The first American report of unidentified objects to receive
wide publicity and to cause some national concern was that of Kenneth
Arnold of Boise, Idaho. Along most of the lines of the "ghost rockets"
discussed; this is evidently the original of the much-used terms like 
"flying saucers" and "flying discs". This incident is Number 17 in the
project files. The date of sighting is given as 24 June 1947. Arnold's
story appeared in many newspapers throughout the country. He even
wrote a series of articles about this sighting for "Fate" magazine.
This periodical styles itself "Cosmic Reporter" and delves into the 
supernatural and fantastic.

Within the month following Arnold's report, the number of
incidents reached a peak that remained unsurpassed for any like period
covered by this report. (This peak was, however, surpassed in May 1949,
following an Air Force press release and a series of articles in the
Saturday Evening Post concerning flying objects. A few individuals
later reported having seen objects prior to the Arnold incident.

Incident #53 -- 5 mi N of Helena, Montana -- 29 July 1947

...with the exception of the color ("like polished nickel") and the lack of sufficient concerning a trail, the object reported in this incident might very well have been a daylight meteor. Bright meteors have been observed to move in wavy paths. The manner of disappearance ("melted into thin air") further supports this view. Time in sight and speed also usual. In short, it is more likely that this object was a bright meteor than that it was anything else.

Incident #03 -- Silver Spring, Ohio -- 7 August 1947

From all evidence, it appears that the object seen here was a bright meteor. Slow-moving meteors occur before midnight, and, while their paths are almost never "absolutely horizontal," it is quite possible that the observer could have gained this impression, since the object was in sight for only three or four seconds. Furthermore, an observer, surprised by an unusual occurrence, often tends to overestimate the actual duration of time; thus, "three or four seconds" might mean not much more than a second.

There is nothing at all in the evidence that cannot be explained under the assumption that the object was a meteor.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #83 - 100 mi. w of Kansas City, Missouri - 6 July 1947

There is no direct astronomical explanation for this 
incident.

The striking feature of the incident is that the "very 
bright" object travelled in the sun direction and at the same 
speed as the observer did, and that it appeared at 11 o'clock 
position at his left, or approximately opposite to the position 
of the sun at the time.

It cannot be proved, of course, but it is probable 
that the witness saw a direct reflection of the sun on some con-
tinuous object - thin clouds, ice crystals, or the like. (Had 
the object appeared on his right, then this explanation would be 
untenable.) Its disappearance can be explained logically also, 
for turning altered the observer's angular relationship to the 
reflector.

It is further noted that an apparent inconsistency 
exists in the report. The observer first stated that the object 
appeared to be the top of a water tank "low and to his left", 
after checking his position he stated that the object was at 11,000 
feet. The inconsistency in altitude throws some suspicion on the 
observation. If the object was low, then a running reflection along 
a river or railroad track would be a promising explanation.

     i. Consultants

     Since, as stated above, there were indications that some
sightings could be attributed to natural phenomena, conventional air-
craft and aerial vehicles, birds, lights, clouds, etc., effort was
made to have all material analyzed by individuals in all technical
fields that might conceivably be touched upon. These individuals and
agencies include the following (only those agencies which provided
usable results are considered.)

     1. Dr. J. A. Hynek, Astronomer, Ohio State University
was awarded a contract, effective 15 December 1948 to 30 April 1949,
for the purpose of attempting to determine which reported objects
might be attributed to natural celestial phenomena.

     2. Headquarters Air Weather Service was requested to re-
view each incident to determine those which may have been weather bal-
loons by comparison of release and weather data with time of sighting,
description of object, and its maneuvers.

     3. Dr. C. E. Valley, Scientific Advisory Board. Since
many reporters colored their reports with talk of ray, electronic
beams, and magnetic support and propulsion, Dr. Valley was asked to
analyze the incidents and decide whether this could possibly be the
case in any instance, and to provide information on this matter.

     4. Rand Corporation was requested to analyze each in-
cident and provide any reasonable explanation that could be determined
from the evidence given. Rand also provided a discussion of the pos-
sibility of visitations by beings from other planets.

however, and, if a meteor, the object should have had a pronounced
vapor trail. The "solar spoular reflection which seemed to shine
in intensity" could, of course, have been light from the meteor it-
self, blended with daylight.

Once again, it is unfortunate that more detailed observa-

Incident 94 -- 420-03' N, 1140 22.2' W -- 30 December 1947

This incident and incidents 95, 96, and 97, which describe the same object, clearly refer to a thoroughly authenticated "Fireball". These sightings can be dismissed with finality by the following quotation from Popular Astronomy, October, 1943.

Fireball of 1547 -- Dec. 30
Harvey S. Hagar

On this date at 1730 f. m. MST a brilliant fireball appeared travelling westward over southern Oregon...
Prof. L. H. Higgs, Austin, previous reports from observers in Oregon, California, and Nevada, and from these made an appropriate solution for its path. He sent both his solution and all the 47 reports to the Flower Observatory where another solution was independently made. Ours agreed closely in all respects with that of Prest except for the heights.

The meteor was most generally reported to be bluish-green in color. It appeared to explode twice, lighting up the countryside to close observers. No sound phenomena were limited to 6 out of the 47 observers.

From the height at which this meteor exploded it is doubtful whether any fragments reached the ground.

It is clear from the general agreement with this of evidence given in incidents 94-97 inclusive that this fireball was the object being described.

oratory was requested to review all material relative to sightings and
to provide psychological and illusory information and determine human
capacity for observing and remembering minute details of range, speed,
size, etc.

While these analyses were being conducted, the Swedish
Defense Staff was contacted through our Air Attache to learn the offi-
cial Swedish attitude toward the “ghost rockets”. The results of these
requests are contained in AA Reports, No. IP-1115-25, 30 December 1948,

flies up to and including Incident No. 212. However, as mentioned
above, Incidents 233 through 237 and all through 211 in the New Mex-
ico area will no be covered in this analysis. In addition to those inci-
dents were excluded by Dr. Fymek as explained in his summary on Page
4 of Appendix “B”, or the remaining 225 then treated, Dr. Hynek con-
cludes that approximately 33% were astronomical with varying degrees of
probability. He concluded that an additional 37% were not astron-
ical but suggestive of other explanations, such as birds, aerostats,
balloons, ordinarily aircraft, etc. The remaining 30% or so doctone
Hynek was concerned either listed insufficient evidence or evidence
offered suggested no explanation. In compiling these statistics,
Dr. Hynek cautiously associated each case at face value, without dis-
counting evidence that estimates hovered on the ludicrous and without
taking into consideration psychological factors. Dr. Hynek then stated
that “55% might conceivably be considered (although the likelihood of
their being so may be very small) as extra-terrestrial or astronomical
in origin”. These include those which either are definitely astron-
omical or can by suitable manipulation of the evidence be construed as
such.

(see Appendix “C”). AFE Weather Service conducted an analysis simular-
aneously with Dr. Hynek tinging the same evidence, AWE attempted to deter-
mine whether a synoptic weather balloon could have been at the location
where a sighting was reported.

In this investigation consideration was given to the wind
direction and speed at the surface and aloft at the scheduled time of
balloon release, and the Location of the nearest weather station making
balloon observations. AWS used files of the first 233 incidents.

Incident #101 -- Moscow, Kansas -- 10 February 1948

This now-celebrated case of an unusual fireball has been adequately reported in astronomical literature; (for details, see Sky and Telescope, April, 1948, page 154, and October, 1948, p.293). Positive identification has been made by the recovery of Fragments. The origin of this object Is, therefore, definitely astronomical, and the incident need not be considered further.

Incident #102 -- air near Green River, Utah -- 19 February 1949

It seems entirely probable tiist the object observed in
this incident and in #103 was the air-rorester meteorite seen at an 
earlier part of its trajectory. 

The direction of flight is stated as "southeast of 
Limon, Colorado." If this means that the object was heading 
southeast from Limon, it could not have been the aircoroster fire-
ball, since the direction of flight of that object was northeast; 
but if the statement merely means that the object was seen in the 
vicinity southeast of Limon, the location is consistent with the 
trajectory of that famous meteorite.

The time stated is approximate, and need not be given
too much concern,. Actually, of course, the sightings here would
have had to be made almost simultaneously with those in Kansas.
If the time had been reported as 1600 lst. instead of 1500 (a
typographical error, by any possibility?), then, allowing for
the difference of one hour in time zones, the sightings would
have been approximately simultaneous.

In any event, whether this was the same or another oh-
ject is not important. The description given -- particularly
the staterant "huge, multicolored ball of fire and dense cloud
of smoke" -- answers closely to that of a fireball.

Incident #21 -- Cartersville, Georgia -- 8 January 1948

While the possibility of this object's being a meteor is not ruled out, it seems unlikely. Meteors are not known to be "light sky blue," nor to travel so slowly as indicated. Moreover, report also states that color was an "intense blue," and, if speed were underestimated (or if object had a large radial velocity component -- coming largely "head-on"), it might possibly be interpreted as a fireball.

The phenomenon described resembles the observation of an
airplane beacon or search light reflecting against an overcast.
This would certainly be periodic, appear phosphorescent, travel at
great speed, and be oval in shape. Such interpretation would dis-
miss the occasional bursting and disintegrating as a subjective
impression. — However, weather conditions are not stated.

Incident #129 -- Wilmington, North Carolina -- 31 May 1943

Evidence in this incident is contradictory, especially concerning tactics, but from the meager description and the fact that the object emitted smoke and travelled at a high speed, the possibility of it having been a meteor is not ruled out. Apparent colors, shapes might have arisen from persistence of vision of a rapidly travelling bright object.

Is there a government testing field for guided missiles near by?

Incident (Incident No. 17). Most were distributed without pattern
throughout the United States. A few were outside the U. S. No two
descriptions of appearance or performance were exactly alike. The re-
ported sightings occurred at various times of day and year.

VII. Relationship Between Publicity and Rates of Reports

The following graph (Fig. 2) illustrates an apparent relation-
ship between reports which received wide publicity, and the total number
of reports. It is believed this has been carried to a sufficient degree
to allow the conclusion that many reports are the direct result of such
publicity.

This was further illustrated recently, when this Command re-
ceived 64 reports of sightings and 51 possible solutions following a
Saturday Evening Post article and an official press release on the sub-
ject of flying objects. Virtually all of the reporters and correspon-
dents made reference to one of the above mentioned articles.

Incident #130 -- Florence, Montana -- 17 May 1948

If this report is to be taken at face value, then no astronomical explanation of this incident is possible.

However, in seeking even a remote logical explanation for the incident, the present investigator is impressed with the fact that on this very night, May 17, Venus was at its greatest brilliancy, with a magnitude of -4.2, ≈ about 100 times brighter than a first magnitude star. It would have appeared that night as an intensely bright light in the northwest.

Incident #131 -- Belleville, Illinois -- 20 June 1948

It appears improbable that this incident has an astronomical explanation. If the evidence is correct as given, the object could not have been a fireball. The zig zag course and the relatively slow speed do not fit in with the description of a large meteor. Lack of flare and train also tend to rule out this hypothesis.

The description answers that of a lighted balloon relatively close by.

There is no direct astronomical explanation for this

This investigator wishes to call attention to the fact

that the objects observed were seen at essentially the same level

as the lower cloud stratum and that there was a high overcast.

Could it be that those officers saw successive shafts of sunlight,

through breaks in the high overcast. illuminating small portions

of the lower cloud stratum? Apparent speed of the objects could

then have been a combination of the relative velocity of the C-47

and the projected motion of the break in the overcast.

mical or otherwise, other than possible extended auroral streamers,

Incident #136, 136a -- S. Knoxville, Tennessee -- 30 June 1948

This incident answers well to the description of a typical
fireball: color -- orange; apparent construction -- fiery exhaust --
"streamer of bluish color trailing", manner of disappearance -- "over
horizon", and (in remark) "streamer emitted sparks."

All of the above fits the typical phenomena associated with
a night-time fireball.

One witness states that the object was in sight for three
minutes and the other states for three seconds. The lower time estimate
is clearly more in keeping with meteoric phenomena. It is also prob-
ably far more nearly accurate, since one is much more likely to grossly
overestimate than underestimate intervals of time.

This report refers solely to a sound phenomenon. Statements of two witnesses indicate specifically that no object was seen. The summary sheet given here seems to confuse the description of this incident with that of incident #138.

Fireballs and bright meteors are often known to emit sounds similar to the rolling of thunder. The information given in this report is so meager, however, that, while the sound referred to could have been meteoric, no decision can be made.

It seems more probable that actual aircraft were heard.

Incident #130 -- Osborn, Ohio -- 9 July 1949

There is no obvious astronomical explanation for this incident.

The present investigator was struck first by the fact that the description of the incident states, "...with about a quarter moon rising in the east-southeast." The quarter moon can never be seen in that position at 2147 hours (local time), for the quarter moon sets at approximately midnight. The moon at that date was not yet at the first quarter, and it set at Osborn at about 2300. The correct statement would be, "...with about a quarter moon setting in the west-northwest." This, oddly enough, is the quadrant of the sky in which the object was reported to be seen. In what direction, then, was the observer really looking?

Although the sky was reported as clear, could it possibly be that rapidly scudding clouds periodically obscured the setting moon -- a moon which, incidentally, does have a pale yellowish-white light?

Other possibilities that suggest themselves are detached auroral streamers or floodlights or searchlights playing on the sky.

Incident #154, 1948 -- Columbus, Ohio -- 2 August 1948

This incident is in two respects unique among all those 
investigated: 1) it is the only object that is defined solely by 
an outline, appearing vacant inside, so that the sky was visible 
through it; and 2) it is similar to an object that this investi-
gator viewed as a boy.

The writer's recollection has remained vivid throughout 
these many years. The object he saw could best be described as a 
floating ellipse, like a wire hoop travelling slowly across the 
sky. The motion was uniform, and the form or the object changed 
slowly, as though the hoop were being distorted. The object was 
observed for at least ten minutes, with several witnesses, until it 
finally disappeared in the distance. The writer had dismissed the 
object as some sort of unusual atmospheric phenomenon, perhaps a 
travelling air pocket.

Because of the similarity between this observation and 
that reported in incident #154, the latter has a special interest 
to this investigator. In the recent incident, however, no tail 
of smoke is an added feature.

There is obviously no astronomical explanation for these 
incidents -- the most plausible explanation probably lies in the 
field of meteorology.

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report.  Give effective textual reference paragraph.  List attachments at which.  Begin text of report at area in Part III.)
1. The Swedish Defense has found no proof that any unidentified flying objects, missiles or vehicles have passed over or near Sweden to date.

2. All reports of sightings in Sweden during the past year, irrespective of the form they were submitted, have been funneled to a special section of the Defense Staff, who to this writing was Pilot A. Toolanen who was exclusively in this investigation.  All sightings followed, somewhat along the lines of the 27 of Project "SIGN".  All of the sightings to himself of sightings; with each case an excess of astronomical phenomena.

3. In addition, 3 ground radar stations and 2 radar equipped destroyers cooperated to maintaining watch.  The radar. equipments were Swedish modified British sets of fairly short range and were not operated on a 24-hour basis; however, no unexplained sightings were made with this equipment.

4. Conclusions: Although the possibility exists that objects have traversed Sweden and its adjacent waters, no proof has been obtained to confirm such flight in any instance.

COMMENT: The cooperation of the Defense Staff in securing this information was undoubtedly given in an effort to emphasize their need for additional U.S. radar equipment. The Swedish Air Board had previously negotiated with the Bendix Corporation for 20 TPS-1a sets but had been refused an export license by our State Department. The members of the Defense Staff, to whom I talked, were eager to point out the good use to which such equipment could be put for flying objects.  And the Swedes as convinced by our mutual interests in unidentified objects could move toward solving the problem as by the refusal to grant an export license for such equipment will do more good in implementing our national policy, as expressed in the National Security Council documents NSC 20/4, than would the information we might receive from the use of such equipment here.

Incident #155 -- Columbus, Ohio -- 31 July 1948

This incident and incident #157, which obviously refer 
to the same object, must be considered together. The object fell 
to earth and was retrieved; it proved to be a "country fair bal-
loon," once quite common in this part of the country. Usually 
they are lighted in mid-afternoon, having one or more fire-pots 
to provide the hot air. They then rise and stay aloft for several 
hours before finally falling to earth.

It is highly probable that the object considered in in-
cident #155, which was observed a few hours earlier on the same 
day and near the same location, was this object, seen while it was 
still high in the sky.

...with two essential items missing, (speed with which the

It is difficult to come to a definite conclusion concerning the
origin of the object observed, but it is certainly possible that
it was parts of the smoke trail of a fireball. Fireball trails
have been known to act in the manner described. The witness states
that the streak was not like an aircraff shell burst or a
vapor trail from a plane; he implies that the motion of the object
forming the trail was very rapid, and that the distance was con-
siderable. At least, nothing is said which is contrary to the
meteoric hypothesis.

a lighted balloon, or even a "county fair" type of balloon.

Or there may be a much simpler explanation for the inci-
dent: the observer was very close to the Allegheny County Airport.
Does the airport have record of either pilot balloon or small air-
craft in the air at the time of the sighting? Since when the ob-
ject seemed to stop it also changed direction, the stopping may
have been merely the effect of perspective.

This incident does not appear to have any relation to in-

No astronomical explanation is possible for this inci-

it have risen again.

It seems incredible that this could have been an actual
physical occurrence, but if it was, it is doubly unfortunate that
no mature observers were at hand. If the object did land just a
few feet away, one would think that even children would have given
a more detailed description. Is it known whether the children
have normal vision? To one with myopia vision, even a buzzard or
hawk diving to a landing might appear as a strange object.

Numerous other reports (included with incident #165), from the vicinity of c^n^justs, which are widely divergent as to time, direction of motion, and color of the object, all appear to refer to a bright meteor. It may be that these separated reports all describe the object of Incident #165, f.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #165 -- Los Alamos, California -- 30 August 1948

The observer of this incident states that the object looked
like a rocket much larger than a B-29. He does not give too dis-
tinct, but estimates the altitude as well over 20,000 feet. At this
estimated distance, it appears to this investigator that something to 
a rocket must have been horribly subjective.

Although a rocket cannot be ruled out, it is also possible
that the object seen was a bright meteor. If the time of observation
given is correct, it was late twilight. It seems that a bright meteor
appearing at this time would give the general impression of a rocket
leaving a trail.

The report states that the object was observed through a field
glass taken from a German 88 mm. artillery piece used that each lens was 3" in diameter. (This is an improbably large size for a field glass.)
If the object constantly filled the lens at this given altitude, either
it was of a truly tremendous size or the glass was out of focus. Fur-
thermore, the telet_Air and summary states that the object was travelling from west to east (another report says from north to south); If it
had been a rocket heading east, this heading would probably have been
reported.

All in all, the evidence supports the conclusion that the
object was more likely a bright meteor than a huge rocket.

The object observed here was probably an exploding fire-

thus, with partial cloud coverage, could easily explain the absence
of a trail.

It is not likely that lights situated on the water surface
or aircraft situated lower had any relation to the original object.

If the object had been a shell fired from the USS John,
it appears improbable that only one shell would have been observed.

are at opposite ends of the scale, there is nothing in the evidence to favor one or the other.

In passing, it is interesting to note that this incident occurred just four days before the famous "Maury Island 
ship". Maybe our visitors from Mars were cruising around?

Incident #52 -- near Moorhead, Minnesota -- 24 October 1949

Despite this observer's statement that the object seen
could not have been a meteor, the possibility is not ruled out.
Early evening is the most propitious time for the observation of
slow, bright meteors. This is the time of day when a meteor in-
bound to the sun and caught by the earth's gravitational field
would appear to travel from east to west, and could appear to rise
slightly. Most people identify meteors with sharp, fast flashes
of light, which are not at all characteristic of slow fireballs.
The observed turn is difficult but not impossible to explain;
this investigator would prefer, however, to think that it was an
illusion caused by perspective.

UNCLASSIFIED

Lociants alor -- Richland, Indiana -- 5 November 1948

This incident very likely has an astronomical explanation; 
the object sighted was probably Venus. Venus rose on November 5 at 
about 3:30 A. M. and an hour later would have been a little south of 
east at an altitude of about 10°. Its magnitude was -3.4, or about
six times brighter than the brightest star in the sky. The photo-
graph taken of the object sighted does not contradict this hypothesis.

It is unlikely that the object observed was the Giacobini
comet (1946L) discovered one day earlier in the southern hemisphere, 
for this comet at that time was very far to the south and east, almost 
on the horizon, and was very much fainter than Venus. If the object 
seen here had been this comet, the persons observing it would lay claim 
to the first discovery. It was discovered one day later in Australia
because of more favourable location.

Venus, of course was visible all during the autumn of 1948
in approximately the same position as that in which it was seen on the 
morning of November 5.

It is also of interest to note that Mercury had its greatest 
western elongation on November 5, but it rose just at the beginning of 
the morning twilight and would therefore have begun just rising at the 
time of this incident. Furthermore, Mercury was much less brilliant 
than Venus.

Incident #156 -- near Grays Harbor, Washington -- 30 October 1948

From the major information given by Lieutenant xxxxman, presumably a responsible and well-trained observer, positive identification of the object is impossible, but it appears likely that it was a bursting fireball.

Two bits of evidence that tend toward this interpretation are the following: one object bursting into ten or twenty pieces, color white and yellow, and the short time in sight. Number of appearances, simply fading; from view "like flares from an airplane," is also similar to that of a disintegrating fireball. In bright daylight the otherwise bright, flare-like quality is sometimes not observed.

Against this interpretation are the following: no lights or outstanding reflection, and no trail. The former might be the result of bright daylight; obviously the objects were observed, and if they were yellow and white, they must have had some luminosity. Lack of trail is, however, unusual.

Unfortunately, without more detailed information, little more can be said.

Although the four observers had no technical training, their reports are remarkably consistent. The object was in sight several minutes, too long to be a meteor; it made a banking turn of 45° and appeared to reflect sunlight very strongly. The speed was great but not excessive.

The object seen could have been an advertising blimp, a balloon, or an aircraft. The banking turn appears to rule out the balloon, unless this was a subjective impression caused by the turning of the balloon in the wind.

In summarizing the luminosity, the object reported
here answers to the description of a slow-moving fireball. Since
it was in sight "one second or less," the first quarter moon and,
presumably, the lights of the city and the airport, providing back-
ground and foreground illumination, may have worked to diminish the
brilliance of the object. This time of day was most propitious for a
slow-moving meteor. Unless a more likely explanation is forthcoming,
this incident can be tentatively ascribed to the flight of a fire-
ball.

It seems entirely probable that the object sighted in this

earlier in Australia. The comet was suitably placed for observation
near the equator and in the Southern Hemisphere. The time of obser-
vation also agrees closely with the time of visibility. There is no
single statement in this limited report that contradicts this comet
hypothesis. If the observer had given the usual bearing of the ob-
ject, these would have eliminated the matter.

Incident 205 -- Carta[illegible], obscured -- 31 October (?), 1943

The vague nature of the information reported in this inci-
dent and the informed unreliability of the observer makes it difficult
to take the incident seriously, especially since the observer has ob-
viously jumped to conclusions on the basis of insufficient evidence.

However, if credence is given to the observations, either
they must be placed with the group of "aluminum-colored objects," or,
if liberal allowance is made for subjective impressions, one could
stretch a point to say that a slow-moving fireball was seen. This hy-
pothesis is far fetched, but the speed of the object and the time of
day favor it. The fact that the observer stated that the object was
aluminum colored actually means little, since in Luminosity identified
it as a flying saucer, which is known from numerous prior reports to be such
a color.

It is very difficult to deal with reports of untrained and
unreliable observers, because they invariably see in an incident
what they wish to see there.

From a purely physical basis, this investigator would prefer
the meteor hypothesis, even though the evidence is entirely insuf-
ficient to establish it.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident. 203 -- Clark AF Base, Philippine Islands -- 12 October 1949

Two things enter heavily into our, possibly stereotyped, evaluation
of this incident: the reported maneuverability of the object, and
the character evaluation of the witness.

If the facts are as stated, then there is no astronomical
explanation for the object observed. A few points favor its having
been a daylight meteor: its snow-white color, speed faster than
that of a jet plane, roaring noise, similarity to "sky writing", and
the trail of dust, or the observation. The tactics, however, if really
performed, oppose it strenuously.

The question is, did the object actually maneuver in and
out of a cloud bank -- or four, did it make turns of 90° or less?

It is possible that such impressions were merely illusions. The witness
saw the object intermittently through clouds. It is not clear whether
he ever saw it against a cloud background or sky; it is very likely in and
between clouds, a fact which is highly important. If he saw it only
in breaks between clouds, this fact, coupled with its great speed,
makes it clear that only momentary impressions could be obtained.
Such observations, by an untrained observer, may bring forth a des-
cription that is extremely unlike the facts.

The impression of a fuselage with windows could even more
easily have been a figment of the imagination.

Unless more specific information concerning this incident
becomes available, the present investigator cannot say whether an
astronomical explanation is [CENSORED] or not. UNCLASSIFIED

It is difficult to ascertain whether the objects described 
in this report belong to the general group of "flying discs" or 
"flashes," or not. The description here is sufficiently different 
from the "variety to indicate that they do not" the characteristic 
this green color is not mentioned.

It is probable, however, that these engines/aircraft, 
all occurring at approximately 2200 hours and in the same locality,
can be explained as astronomical phenomena. Furthermore, this stated
altitude and distance are entirely out of keeping; this fact might
be dismissed as an illusion, common in the observation of fireballs,
if the instance were isolated. The weight of the evidence, however,
inclines to the conclusion that the objects were man-made devices
and part of some scientific experiment, so common in that section 
of the country.

If it were not for the dubious moral color of this
object, it would answer the description of a fireball. In view,
however, of many similar observations in the last twelve years, this
interpretation is open to question. It should be noted that while
heading outward over much farthest north track did so majority
of the "green flashes," yet at the observer was much south.
Nevertheless, considering the geographical differences, and the
differences in times and in time of night of the observation, this
object could very well have been a fireball. Insufficient evi-
dence is offered to decide whether it belongs to sect; the man-made
objects or an arm to fireballs.

solely to indicate the possible astronomical content of the reports
at hand, in the primary analysis all evidence was accepted at face
value, with no attempt to evaluate psychological factors. Fre-
quently, however, when fairly liberal limits of tolerance were al-
lowed, the report made sense physically, whereas the literal
statement did not. (Whenever allowance was made for possible errors
arising from subjective reporting, the fact was noted.) Further-
more, while some of the reports verge on the ludicrous, the atti-
tude deliberately adopted was to assume honesty and sincerity on
the part of the reporter. Among the general public, two attitudes
toward "flying saucers" seem to be prevalent: one, that all are
obviously illusions, hallucinations, or hoaxes; the other, that
"there must be something to it." From the outset, this investigator
has attempted to regard each report, insofar as is logically possible,
as an honest statement by the observer, and to adhere to neither of
the two schools of thought.

One further comment should be made: Almost all of the data
dealt with in this investigation are extremely tenuous. Many of the
observers' reports are incomplete and inexact, and some are distinctly
contradictory. Therefore, it has obviously been impossible to reach
definite, scientific conclusions. Most explanations are offered in
terms of probability, the degree of which is discussed in the indivi-
dual reports, but can be indicated only generally in the statistics
which follow.

type of projector, such as a "flak" or an illumination dump or flasher;
rather, it is true that when a bolide explodes a blinding flash
or light is seen, and tremendous sounds are sometimes heard for
many seconds. Since this is, was obvious at the time of this in-

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

What, in particular, was gathered from the evidence concerning the astronomical character of the objects observed?

Of the 244 incidents submitted, 7 are excluded from all statistical reckoning: 1 is identified (in the subject report) as a hoax, 3 are duplicates, and 3 contain no information. In summarizing the findings in the remaining 237, two systems of classification are possible:

First, all incidents can be placed in one of two classes:

1) those which under no stretch of the imagination can be regarded as astronomical or extra-terrestrial (extra-terrestrial throughout this investigation refers solely to natural objects not originating on earth; it does not include "space ships from other planets"), and

2) those which either are definitely astronomical or can by suitable manipulation of the evidence be construed as such. The object here is to segregate all cases in which any vestige of astronomical origin is indicated. When this division is made, 111, or 47%, fall into the definitely non-astronomical category, or, conversely stated, 126, or 53%, might conceivably be considered (although the likelihood of their being so may be very small) as extra-terrestrial or astronomical in origin. The exact percentage is not important. The significant thing is that over 50% of the incidents might possibly be explained astronomically, if wide enough tolerances were allowed.

sizes very; so well, the objects were actually either of "aircraft sizes,
or more likely, that they were far enough from the observers so that bin-
ocular vision produced no stereoscopic effect; this is only means that they
were farther off" than about thirty feet; 2) size objects were seen to
disappear behind trees, buildings, clouds etc, they are far enough to
be visible at the range of those resolvable objects.

Now it is obviously of prime importance to estimate the size and mass
of the observed objects. This may be possible to some extent if it is
permissible to assume that they obey the laws of physics. Since the ob-
jects have not been observed to produce any physical effects, other than
the one case in which a cloud was demonstrated along the trajectory, it is
not certain that the laws of mechanics, for instance, would be sufficient.

But suppose that mechanical laws alone are sufficient. Then the
following example is sufficient proof that at least a tenth could, in
principle, be determined: suppose a simple pendulum were observed sus-
pended in the sky; then after observing its frequency of oscillation, we
could deduce from the laws of mechanics its precise length.

This suggests that something could be deduced from the observed flutter-
ing motion of some of the objects of group I. Assume that we know the ang-
ular frequency and angular amplitudes of this fluttering motion (they can be
measured in principle from a motion picture). Then for purposes of calculation
assume the object to be thirty feet in diameter, to be as rigid as a normal
aircraft wing of 30 foot span, to be constructed of material of the optimum
weight-strength ratio and to be a structure of most efficient design. It
is now possible to calculate how heavy the object must be merely to remain
rigid under the observed angular motion. Let the calculation be made
for a plurality of assumed sizes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64----- up to say

According to these findings, 78, or almost one-third, of the 237 incidents yet remain without an appropriate hypothesis for explanation. It is likely, of course, that with additional evidence a number of those included in class 3a would be easily explained (some of them, probably, astronomically). There are, however, at least 40 incidents in which the evidence, if correct as given, does not fit any simple explanation, and a number of these were reported by presumably well-qualified observers.

The image provided appears to contain a segment of typed text of a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. There are no identifiable photographs contained in this particular section of the page. However, there are two small, dark, circular marks; one at the top left corner which seems to be a hole punch, and the other on the left side which might be a marker or blemish on the document.

Now acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, here's the transcribed text from the document:

---

200 feet, and let calculated mass be plotted versus assumed size. The non-
linear character of the curve should indicate an approximate upper limit to
the size of the object.

If in addition, it is assumed that the flutter is due to aerodynamic
forces, it is possible that more precise information could be obtained.

The required angular data can probably be extracted from witnesses
most reliably by the use of a demonstration model which can be made to
oscillate or flutter to a known way.

SUMMARY. PART 2, SECTIO A.
Geophysical oscillographs alone ont not yield the size of objects ob-
served from a single station; such observation, together with the as-
sumption that the objects are essentially aircraft, can be used to set
reasonable limits of size.

PART II, SECTION 5. THE POSSIBILITY OF SUPPORTING AND PROPELLING A SOLID
OBJECT BY MATERIAL MEANS.

Since some observers have obviously colored their reports with talk
of rays, jets, beams, space-ships, and the like, it is well to examine
what possibilities exist along these lines. This is also important in
view of the conclusions of PART II, SECTION 4 of this report.

PROPELLING. Propulsion and support by means of "rays" or "beams".
By "rays" or "beams" are meant either purely electromagnetic radiation
or also radiation which is largely corpuscular like cathode-rays or cosmir-
rays or cyclotron-beams.

Now it is obvious that any device propelled or supported by such means
is fundamentally a reaction device. It is fundamental in the theory of such
devices that a given amount of energy is most efficiently spent if the momen-
tum thrown back or down is large. This means that a large mass should

be given a small acceleration - a theorem well understood by helicopter
designers.

The beams or rays mentioned do the contrary - a small mass is given
a very high velocity - consequently enormous powers - greater than the total
world's power capacity - would be needed to support even the smallest object
by such means.

METHOD II. Direct use of Earth's Magnetic Field.

One observer (incident 66) noticed a violent motion of a hand-held
compass. If we assume from this that the objects produced a magnetic
field, comparable with the Earth's field, namely 0.1 gauss, and that the
observer found that the object subtended an angle α at his position, then
the ampereturns of the required electromagnet is given by

ni = 30 R
α²

For instance, if R is one kilometer and the object is 40 meters in diameter, 
then ni ≈ 1 billion ampereturns.

Now if the object were actually only 10 meters away and were correspond-
ingly smaller, namely 10 cm in diameter, it would still require 10 million
ampereturns.

These figures are a little in excess of what can be conveniently done
on the ground. They make it seem unlikely that the effect was actually
observed.

Now the Earth's magnetic field would react on such a magnet to produce
not only a torque but also a force. This force depends not directly on
the Earth's field intensity but on its irregularity or gradient. This
force is obviously minute since the change in field over a distance of
10 meters (assumed diameter of the object) is scarcely measurable - more-
over the gradient is not predictable but changes due to local ore deposits.

- page 129 -

There are no photographs on this page.

---

Thus even if the effect were large enough to use it would still be unreliable and unpredictable.

METHOD III.  Support of an Electrically Chared Object by Causing it to Move Transverse to the Earth's Magnetic Field.

A positively charged body moving from West to East, or a negatively charged body moving from East to West will experience an upward force due to the Earth's magnetic field.

A sphere 10 meters diameter moving at a speed of one kilometer/second would experience an upward force of one pound at the equator if charged to a potential of 5 x 10^12 volts. This is obviously ridiculous.

SECTION D.  ANTI-GRAVITY SHIELD.

It has been proposed, by various writers, perhaps first by H. G. Wells, that it might be possible to construct a means of shielding a massive body from the influence of gravity. Such an object would then float. Recently there appeared in the press a notice that a prominent economist has offered to support research or such an enterprise.

Obviously, conservation of energy demands that considerable energy be given the supported object in order to place it on the shield. However this amount of energy is in no way prohibitive, and a net return it can be gotten back when the object lands.

Aside from the fact that we have no suggestions as to how such a device is to be made, the various theories of general relativity all agree in assuming that gravitational force and force due to acceleration are indistinguishable, and from this assumption the theories predict certain effects which are in fact observed. The assumption therefore is probably correct, and a corollary of it is essentially that only by means of an acceleration can gravity be counteracted. This we can successfully do.

for instance by making an artificial satellite - but this presumably is not
what has been observed.

SUMMARY, PART II, SECTION B.

Several unorthodox means of supporting or propelling a solid object,
have been considered - all are impracticable. This finding lends credence
to the tentative proposed assumption of Part II, that the objects are
supported and propelled by some normal means, or else that they are not
solids. No discussion of the types of Part II, Section C. can, in principle,
of course, be complete.

PART II, SECTION C. POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THE REPORTS.

CLASSIFICATION I. NATURAL TERRESTRIAL PHENOMENA.

1) The observations may be due to some effect such as ball lightning.
The writer has no suggestions on this essentially meteorological subject.

2) The objects may be some kind of animal.
Even in the celebrated case of incident 172 where the light was
chased by a P-61 for half an hour and which was reported by the pilot to
be intelligently directed, we can make this remark. For consider that an
intelligent assembly of saucers so remarkable devious would not be likely
to play around in so idiot a manner as is reported by the pilot.

In this connection it would be well to examine if some of the lights
observed at night were not fire-flies.

3) The observed objects may be hallucinatory or psychological in origin.
It is of prime importance to study this possibility because we can
learn from it something of the character of the population; its response
under attack; and also something about the reliability of visual obser-
vation.

One would like to assume that the positions held by many of the ro-

rented observers guarantee their observations. Unfortunately there were
tary reports of curious phenomena by pilots during the war - e.g. incident
of the fire-ball Mi fighters comes to mind. Further, officers have been re-
porting sea-serpents for hundreds of years yet no one has yet produced a
photograph.

It would be interesting to tabulate the responses to see how reliable
were the reports on the Japanese balloons during the war. There too had a
phenomenon proven to be real.

It is interesting that the reports swiftly reach a maximum frequency
during the end of June 1947 and then slowly tail off. We can assume that
this is actually an indication of how much or how much we were actually about, or,
quite differently, we can take this frequency curve as indicating something
about mass psychology.

This point can be tested. Suppose the population is momentarily ex-
cited; how does the frequency of reports vary with time? A study of
crank letters received after the recent publicity given to the satelite
reports should give the required frequency distribution.

It is probably necessary but certainly not sufficient that the un-
identified object curve and the crank-letter curve should be similar in
order for the flying disks to be classed as hallucinations.

A large scale experiment was made at the time of Orson Welles's
"Martian" broadcast. Some records of this must persist in newspaper
files.

CLASSIFICATION II. MAN-MADE TERRESTRIAL PHENOMENA.
1) The objects may be Russian aircraft. If this were so, then the con-
siderations of Sections a and B indicate that we would have plenty to
worry about. It is the author's opinion that only an accidental discovery

or a device or techniques never before achieved could suffice to explain such devices. It is doubtful whether a potential enemy would arouse our curiosity in so idle a fashion.

CLASSIFICATION OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL OBJECTS.

1) Meteors: it is noteworthy that the British physicist Lovell writing in “Physics Today” mentions the easier discovery of a new daytime meteorology, which Lovell raised awareness during the 1947. The reported objects loom little of their trust; however, if they are of meteoritic origin.

2) Animals: although the objects as described, seem less animal than anything else, there are few reliable reports on extraterrestrial animals.

3) Space Ships. The following considerations are fair:

a) If th...re is an extra terre trial civilization which owns such objects as...re reported or let us most probably, that its development is far in advance of ours. this argument out by onverted or probability arguments alone without recourse to astronomical hypotheses.

b) Such a civilization might observe that on earth we now have atomic bombs and even fast developing rockets. in view of the past history of mankind they should be alarmed. We should therefore expect at this time above all to behold such visitations.

Aside the acts of mankind most easily observed from a distance are A-bomb explosions we should expect some relation to obtain between the time of A-bomb explosions, the time at which the space ships are seen, and the time required for such ships to arrive from and return to homebase.

PART III. RECOMMENDATIONS.

1) The file should be continued.

2) A meteorologist should compute the approximate error required to

evaporate as much cloud as shown in the indident 26 photographs. Together
with an aerodynamist he should examine whether a meteorite of unusual
shape could move as observed.

3) The calculations suggested in Part II, Section A, should be estimated
by an aerodynamist with such changes as his more detailed knowledge
may suggest.

4) The mass-psychology studies outlined in Part II, Section C, Claudi-
fication 3) should be carried out by a competent staff of statisticians
and mass-psychologists.

5) Interviewing agents should carry objects or moving pictures for compar-
ison with reporter's memories. These devices should be properly designed
by a psychologist experienced in problems pertaining to aircraft and de-
sign of aircraft control equipment so that he shall have some grasp of
what it is that is to be found out. If the Air Force has reason to be
seriously interested in these reports it should take immediate steps to
interrogate the reporters more precisely.

6) A person skilled in the optics of the eye and of the atmosphere should
investigate the particular point that several reports agree in describing
the objects as being about ten times as wide as they are thick; the
point being to see if there is a plurality of actual shapes which appear
so under conditions approaching limiting resolution or detectable con-
trast.

Lieutenant Colonel M. J. Tremel

Air Material Command
Wright-Patterson Field
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Colonel Tremel:

In reply to your inquiry of March 24th, we had not planned to issue a formal report on project "SIGN" until or unless our study leads to some unusual or unexpected findings which would throw new light on "flying saucers."

We are now working through the mass of available significant correspondences or other indirect pieces of evidence. It is expected that we shall have explored all our various avenues of attack in about two months. To date we have found nothing which would seriously contravert simple rational explanations of the various phenomena in terms of balloons, conventional aircraft, planets, meteors, bits of A.F., optical illusions, practical jokers, psychopathological reports, and the like.

We should like to take this opportunity to raise a few questions, (1) Why is it so important, as it is a psychopathological curiosity? (2) Why the Airline doctos [sic] so cavalierly pooh-pooh it? (2) [apparently the fisherman incident is deleted from the data-why?) (3) We have heard from a reliable source of an incident in which fishermen observed a flying object which dropped hot material which they collected and subsequently gave to official investigators. The investigators' plane crashed but there was a survivor. We do not seem to have a file or this incident - certainly not a complete file. Why was the data?

Sincorely yours,

Dear General Putt:

Please refer to your letter of 18 November 1943 relative to the
"Flynn, object" problem and to Mr. Collbohm's reply dated 24
November 1943. In paragraph (b) of the reply, Mr. Collobohm
promised (among other things) to send a discussion of the
"special design and performance characteristics that are believed
to distinguish space ships."

This present letter gives, in very general terms, a description
of the likelihood of a visit from other worlds as an engineering
problem and some points regarding the use of gasseous vehicles as
compared with descriptions of "flying objects," i.e., Collobohm
will deliver copies to Cololel McCoy at Wright-Patterson Air
Base during the RAND briefing there within the next rew days.

A good beginning is to discuss some possible physics of origin
of "visiting space ships. Astronomers largely in agreement
that only one member of the Solar System (besides Earth) can
support higher forms of life. It is the planet Mars. Even
Mars appears quite desolate and inhospitable so that a race
would be more occupied with survival than we are on Earth.
Reference 1 gives adequate descriptions of conditions on the
various planets and a simulated, "A visit contact from from [sic]
(p. 229) same will be included here.

Whether intelligent beings exist to appreciate these
splendors of the martian landscape is pure speculation.
If we have correctly reconstructed the history of Mars,
there is little reason to bellieve that the life processes
may not have followed a course similar to terrestrial
evolutionary. With this assumption, three general possi-
bilities emerge. Intelligent beings may have protected
themselves against the excessively slow loss of atmos-
phere, oxygen and water, by constructing homes and 
cities wi with the physical conditions scientifically con-

Martian climate. Or the race may have perished.

These poss7ilitits hrve yeen sufficiently expounded in
the pseudo-scientific literature to make further amplifi-
cation superfluous. However, there my exists some interest-
ing restrictions to the,snsory 7ircle physiology of a Martian.

pletely altered respiratory system for warm-blooded creatures,

mass of a identical column on the Earth, ct a body temperture
of 770°. tho critical mPss ratio is reduced to about exght-
twelfth, and at 50°F. to about 0.1 twenty-fourth. The
critical vues are of the escnt oj order as those estimated
for the Martin atmoshere. Accordingly, the roomy and phys-
iology of a Martier mE be radically different from ours but
this is all konjecture.

We do not know thz origin of life, nor over the Earth. We
are unable to observe any simis of intelligent life on Mars.

In the next few paragraphs, we speak of Mars. It should
be understood that most of the remarks apply equally well to
Venus.

Various people have suggested that a diamond race may have 
been visiting Earth for last ten thousand years from one
to Mars. The first objection to such interstellar travel is denied
down through the penetrators. If this were true, a race of such
knowledge and power would have established some form of direct-
contact. They could so gain Earth's inhabitants world be hap-

One other hypothetical needs to be discussed. It is that the
Martians may kept a long-term routine watch on Earth and have
been slammed by sight, of our portholes telescopes. Earthine that
is open water. Here on the threshold of space travel. (Venus
in an unlimited medical case.) The icy celestial envelopes were
such as survive hypersensitive people. Radar flying objects would make

plosions, I.e., Alamorgordo, Hiroshima, Nagasiki, Crossroads A
and Crossroads B, or the third, the first two were (in pestilores of

the thin stratosphere, would build telescopes simply enough to see
A-bombs explosions on Earth, even though were 165 and 153
million miles away, respectively, on the Alamorgordo and Hiro-
shima dates. The weakest point in this hypothesis is that a
continual, defensive watch on Earth for long periods of time
(perhaps thousands of years) would be full alert, or no race
benevolent remotely resembled Man would undertake it. We
haven't even considered the idea for Venus or Mars, for example.

The summation substance of this discussion is that if Martians
are now visitining us without contact, It can be assumed that
they have just recently succeeded in space travel and that
their civilization would be practically abreast of ours.

The chance that Martians, under such widely divergent condi-
tions, would have a civilization resembling our own is ex-
tremely remote. It is particularly unlikely that their
civilization would get within a half century of our own state
of advancement. Yet in the last 50 years we have just started
to use aircraft and in the next 50 years we will almost
certainly start exploring space.

Thus it appears that space travel from another point within
the Solar system is possible but very unlikely. Odds are at
least a thousand-to-one against it.

This leaves the totality of planets of other stars in the
Galaxy as possible sources. Any modern astronomers believe
that planets are fairly normal and logical affairs in the life
history of a star (rather than an astrophysical oddities) so that
many planets can be expected to exist in space.

To narrow the field a little, some loose specifications can
be written for the star about which these habitable planets would
revolve. Let us say that the star should bear a family re-
semblance to the Sun, which is a member of the so-called "main
sequence" of stars, i.e., we eliminate white dwarfs, red giants
and supergiants. For a description of these types, see refer-
ence 2, Chapter 5, there is no special reason for making this
assumption except to simplify discussion: we are still consider-
ing the majority of stars.

Next, true variable stars can be eliminated, since conditions on
a planet attached to a variable star would fluctuate too wildly
to permit life. The number of stars deleted here is negligibly
small. Reference 3, pages 76 and 83 indicate that the most
common types are too bright to be in nearby space unnoticed.
Lastly, we shall not carry our multiple stars, since the condi-
tions for stable planet orbits are obscure in such cases. About
a third of the stars are eliminated by this restriction.

As our best known sample of space we can take a volume with
the Sun at the center and a radius of 16 light-years. A compilation
of the 17 known stars, Including the Sun, within this volume is 
given in reference 1, pages 52 to 57. Eliminating according to
the above discussion, three are white dwarfs, eight binaries
account for 16 stars and two trinaries account for 6 more. The
remainder, 22 stars, can be considered as eligible for habitable
planets.

---

Assuming the above volume to be typical, the contents of any
other reasonable volume can be found by varying the number of stars
proportionately with the volume, or with the radius cubed. S = 22 x
( R / 16 ), where S is number of eligible stars and R is the radius
of the volume in light years. (This Formula should only be used for
radii greater than 15 light years. For smaller samples we call for
a recount. For example, the only known eligible star other than the
Sun lies within eight light years.)

Having an estimate of the number of useable stars, it is now
necessary to make a guess as to the number of habitable planets. We
have only one observed sample, the Solar System, and the guess must
be made with low "confidence, since intelligent life may not be randomly
distributed at all.

The Sun has nine planets, arranged in a fairly regular progression
of orbits (see reference 1, Appendix I). that lends credence to
theories that many stars have planets. Of the nine planets, (one, the
Earth), less completely inhospitable. If we work on a "jetison orbital"
various mass sizes! Mars has extremely vigorous living conditions, and
Venus has an unsuitable atmosphere. If we very broadly inject, that
could mean that each star would have a series of planets so spaced
that one, or possibly two, would have correct temperatures, correct
moisture content and a troposphere to support civilized life. Let us
assume that there is, on the average, one habitable planet per eligible
star.

There is no line of reasoning or evidence which can indicate
whether life will actually develop on a planet where the conditions
are suitable. Here again, the Earth may be unique rather than a random.
sample. This writer can only inject some personal intuition into the
discussion with the view that life is not unique on Earth, or given
the random result of a low probability, but the practically inevitable
in the right conditions. This is to say, the number of inhabited
planets is equal to the number of useable stars!

One more item needs to be considered. Knowing not at all
about other races, we must assume that, is average as to technical
advancement, environmental difficulties, etc. That is, one half of the
other planets are behind us and have no space travel and the other
half are ahead and have various levels of space travel. We can thus
imagine that in our sample volume there are 11 races of beings who have
begun space explorations. The formula on page 3 above now becomes

R = 11 x ( R / 16 )^3
where R is the number of races exploring space in a spherical volume
of radius R > 16 light years.

Arguments like those applied to Martians on page 2 need not apply
to races from other star systems. Instead of being a first contact
call, Earth would possibly be reached only after many centuries of de-
velopment and exploration with space ships, so that a visiting race
would be expected to be far in advance of Man.

```
To summarize the discussion thus far: the chan :e of spa.:o
travelers existinc at plants attached to neighboring stars is very
much greater than the chance of space-travelin Martinians. The
one can be viewed almost as a certainty (if the assumotions are
accepted), whereas the oth r is very slight indeed.

In order to estimate to relative chan ;es that visitors from
Mars or star X could come to the Farth and act like "flying objects",
some discussion of characteristics of spa:e ships is necessary.

To handle the simple case first, a trip from Mars to Earth
should be feasible using a rock t-powered vehicle. One here, the
rocket would probably use more fuel in slowine down for a landing
than it did in initial takeoff , due to Earth's higher gravitational
force.

A rou^h estimate of one-way performance can by found by gdding
the so-called "escape velocity" of Mars to that of the Earth plus
the total energy change (kinetic and potnttia:) used in transferring
from one planetary orbit to the other. These are 3.1, 7.9, and 10.7
miles pe second, respectively), victory miles gained per so m ion e
of 20.8 miles per second for a one-way flight. Barri: a refueling
mission, the vehicle would have to land and replenish or else carry
100% reserves for the trip home.

Let us assume the Martians have develop nd a nuclear, hydro --:
propelled vehlcle (the most efflcie t basic arrangen^nt that has
been conceived here on Earth) which uses basic state es to get here
and the remaining stages to return to Mars, thus completing a round
trip without refueling but slowin down enough in our atmosphere to be easily visible (i.e., practically mark'[ing a landline). Since it
is nuclear powered, gas temperatures will be llnnted to the maximum
operating temperatures the materials can withstand (that must transfer
from the pile to the gas, so cooling can't be used in the pile).
The highest melting point material of which we can fins
uranium carbide. It has a melting point of 450%</in. Assume the Martians
are capable of realizing a gas temperature of 450@R ( = 2500K), and
that they also have alloys which make high motor pressures (3000
psi) economical. Then the specific Impulse will be ( = 1035 seconds
and the exhaust velocity will be 1 - 33,400 ft/sec (reference 5).
Calculations show that using a single stage for each leg of the journey would require a fuel/gross weight ratio of,o.96 (for each stage)
too high to be practical. Using two stages each way (Four alo^pther)
brings the required fuel ratio down to,.91, a value that can be
realized.

If, by the development of strong alloys, the basic weight could
be kept to 10% of the total wight for each stage, a residue of 9%
could be used for payload. A four stage vehicle would then have a
gross weight (100%) = 15,000 tones as treats the payload: thu,s,
if the payload were 2,000 pounds, the ross weight would be 30 million
pounds at initial takeoff (Earth pounds).

Here is the text from the document:

---
Of course, if we allow the Martians to refiol, the vehicle
could have only two stages* and the cross wet ght would be only
(100)^2 = 125 times the payload, i.e., 250,000 pounds. This would
require brin^int; electrolysis and refrigerating equipment and sitting
at the South Pole long enough to extract fuel for the journey home,
since they have not asked us for supplies. Our oceans (electrolysis
to make H2O) would be obvious to Martian telescopes and they might
conceivisly follow such a plan, particularly if they came here without
foreknowledge that Earth has a civilization.

Requirements for a trip from a planet attached to some star
other than the Sun can be calculated in a simillar manner. Here the
energy (or velocity) required has more parts: (a) escape from the
planet (b) escape from the star (c) enough velocity to traverse a
few licht years of space in reasonable time. (d) deceltr*n towards
the Sun (e) decelration towards the Earth. The nearest "eligible"
star is an object called Wolf 359 (see reference 4, p. 52 of report
for the last three years of its spectrum). The distance is a notable
distance of 8.0 light years. If is "small, having an absolute magnitude of 16.6 and its typical IQ degrees.hr^1 of which make up more
than half of the eligible populations. By comparison with similar
stars of known mass, this star is estimated to have a mass from 1/10^ly
1/03 as great as the sun. Since the star has a low luminosity (being
much cooler and smaller than the Sun) a habitable planet would need
to be in a small orbit or warm.

Of the chain-:) of enerr required as listed in the preceding
paragraph, item (c), velocity to treverse intervening space, is so
large as to make the others comparatively negligible. If the visitors
were lone lived and could "hibernate" for 30 years both coming and
going, then 1/10 th of 1% of 1% what would be required, i.e., the
enormous velocity gap, perhaps, not pierced. This is definitely
beyond the reach of any praditted level of rocket propulsion.

If a race were far enough advanced to make really efficient use
of nuclear energy, then a leerj^e pa^t of the masses of the nuclear ma-
terial might be converted into jet energy. We have no idea how
to do this, in fact temperatures, indicateds that the attainers required
to withstand the reactor are^ 6 J, or, must be fundamentally attain-
able. Let us start from a jet-propelled-to-<ross-weight ratio of
75. If the to total amount of expendanlear material (nuclear plus propell-
ent) can be .85 of the gross weight, then the nuclear material expended
can be .10 of the gross. Usine an efficiency of .5 for converting
nuclear energy to jet enerzy and neglecting relativitistic mass cor-
rections, then a rocket velocity of half time velocity of light could
be attained. This would mean a transit time of 16 years each way from
the star Wolf 359, or longer times from other eligible stars. To try
to go much faster would mean spending much energy on relativistic change
in mass and therefore operating at lowered efficiency.

Actually three stages. On the trip to Earth, the first st'e^ would
be filled with fuel, the second st'we^ would contain partial fuel, the
third would be empty. The first st'ag^ would be thrown away during
fligh.t. On the trip back to Mars, the second and third st'ages would be
filled with fuel. The gross wet-tht of the initial vehicle would be of
the order of magnitude of a cup of stage rocket.

To summarize this section of the discussion, it can be said that a trip from Mars is a logical enterprise; another over our own present technical status, but that a trip from a star system requires improvements of propulsion that we have not yet conceived.

Combining the efforts of all the science-fiction writers, we could conjure up a large number of hypothetical methods of transportation like gravity shields, space warps, teleporters, simultrans, extensions terms and so on. Conceivably, gravity shields or stellators systems in the Galaxy, one or more races may have mastered methods of travel that would be fantastic by our standards. Yet the larger the volume of space that must be included in order to strengthen this possibility, the lower will be the chance that the race involved would ever find the earth. The Galaxy has a hundred billion to 100,000 light years and a total mass about two hundred of thirty times that of the Sun (see Reference 1). On this estimate probably three and estimated numbers is several hundred million (see Reference 2 and 4) At distances up to billions of light years (see reference 7, p. 1584). The number of stars in the known universe is enormous, yet so are the distances involved. A super-race (unless they occupy fantastically) would not be likely to stumble upon Planet III of Sol, a fifth-magnitude star in the rarified outskirts of the Galaxy.

A description of the probable operating characteristics of space ships must be based on the assumption that they will be rocket, since this is the only form of propulsion that we know will function in outer space. Below are listed a few of the significant factors of rocketry in relation to the "flying objects".

(a) Maneuverability. A special-purpose rocket can be made as maneuverable as we like, with very high accelerations either along or normal to the flight path. However, a high-performance space ship will certainly be large and unwieldy and could hardly be designed to maneuver favorably around in the Earth's atmosphere. The only economical maneuver would be to come down and go up more or less vertically.

(b) Fuel reserves. It is hard to see how a single rocket ship could carry enough extra fuel to make repeated descents into the Earth's atmosphere. The large number of flying objects reported in quick succession could only mean a larger number of visiting craft.

Two possibilities thus are presented. First, a number of space ships could have come as a group. This would only be done if full-dress contact were to be established. Second, numerous small craft might descend from a mother ship which coasts around the Earth in a satellite orbit. But this could mean that the smaller craft would have to be rockets as still tether announces, and to concerns them the mother ship would have to be truly enormous.

(c) Appearance. A vertically descending rocket might well appear as a luminous disk to a person directly below. Observers at a distance, however, would surely identify the rocket for what it really is. There would probably be some reports of oblique views than of end-on views; of course, the "shape reports" not typical of our rockets; yet the exhaust should be easy to see.

maneuvering or not maneuvering. It is quite possible that it was
simply climbing steeply on a relatively straight course, such as would
be taken by a lighted weather balloon.

As a matter of fact, a lighted weather balloon was released by
the Fargo Weather Station within 10 minutes of the time the light was
first sighted by the P-51 pilot. It is the opinion of the writer
that this lighted balloon easily could have accounted for all of the
pilot's observations. (It should be noted that the standard 30 inch
and 65 inch weather balloons have a vertical speed of about 600 and
1100 ft./min. respectively.)

General Discussion and SUMMARY

In the preceding section the hypothesis has been advanced that
most reports of unidentified flying objects have been the result
of persons failing to identify familiar phenomena, such as reflections
from bright surfaces in the day or lights in a night sky. It is
believed that this explanation will account for many of the reports.

However, some reports undoubtedly have other explanations.

Vertigo. The term vertigo covers a large group of miscellaneous
phenomena including air sickness, disbelief in one's instruments,
and partial loss of orientation. The conditions under which some of
the observations of flying objects were made were such that they could
have produced loss of orientation on the part of an observer. This
is especially true for those experiences occurring at night and those
in which attempts were made to "chase" the object. Movement is always
relative. If the only outside reference is a point of light, and both
the observer and the object observed are moving, it would be practically
impossible under certain conditions to tell which was moving and
which was not, or to separate out the two motions. It is hard enough

to fly a good pursuit curve on another aircraft in good daylight, for 
example, much less to close on a solitary light at night. The difficulty
is due chiefly to the inability to judge distance or speed of a point
source of light.

Suggestion. Suggestion works in various ways. Sensational
radio and newspaper reports lead a few people to imagine they are 
seeing things they are not seeing. The effect on most people is to 
dampen their critical judgment. Under such conditions we are more 
likely to overlook certain factors, and find it easier to accept the
suggested explanation uncritically. The expected result would be to
make the reports of most observers slightly less accurate than if
they had never heard reports of others seeing "flying saucers".
Particularly when the stimulus object is fuzzy or ill-defined, persons
tend to see it as resembling whatever is suggested to them. Carmichael
et. al., for example (1932) showed individuals simple designs and gave
then the name of an object. When the individuals drew the design
from memory, they drew it to resemble whatever the object was that
had been suggested to them.

Precedents. An historical precedent can be found for most errors 
of human observation. Although the writer has not tried to make an 
historical survey of reports of earlier unidentified aerial objects,
he feels sure that there have been many such reports in years past,
particularly during and after World War II.

Small Wind-borne Obiects. It is possible that some observers 
may have seen small objects carried aloft by strong winds, or objects
dropped from aircraft. Bits of paper, small cartons, etc., may oc-
casionally be carried to a considerable height by strong winds. Air- 
craft may sometimes jettison small articles. It would be impossible to

overestimate the distance, size or speed of such objects, and it would be
easy to fail to recognize them.

Conclusions

It is concluded by the writer that there are sufficient psychological
explanations for the reports of unidentified flying objects to
provide plausible explanations for reports not otherwise explainable.
These errors in identifying real stimuli result chiefly from inability
to estimate speed, distance and size.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are offered:

1. Test the ability of pilots to estimate the course of a small
lighted balloon while doing acrobatics with it at night. It is suggested
that several pilots try to fly pursuit curves and collision courses
on such targets at night and report accurately their sensations. It
would be desirable, but probably impossible, to keep them from knowing
the nature of the light source.

2. In all future reports of unidentified objects specify the
location of the object with reference to polar coordinates (direction
and degrees above the horizon) rather than asking individuals to estimate
distance. If possible, obtain an estimate of size in terms of the
visual angle subtended by the object.

3. In all future investigations determine the angular position
of the sun with respect to the unidentified object and the observer.
Also determine the approximate time during which the object was in
sight (this information was not available for more than half the
reports).

Third, if this type of investigation is to be continued,

preferable either that the interrogator and technical specialist by

Information on "Ball Lightning"

I. Origin

Various theories and suggestions have been proposed to explain ball lightning, most of them being without well-established physical foundation. There is still doubt in scientific circles regarding the origin of a number of reported cases of ball lightning.

Briefly, the explanations of the origin of ball lightning may be broken down as follows:

(1) Brush discharge (St. Elmo's fire).

(May be stationary over sharp-pointed objects, or moving along or near the surface of wires, roofs, rocks, etc., especially on mountains. Conditions most favorable for brush discharge occur during thunderstorms, but the phenomenon may occur even during clear, dry, dusty weather. When a lightning stroke is approaching an object, the brush discharge becomes especially intense.)

(2) Intensely ionized, incandescent volume of air forming end of lightning stroke and lasting for short interval of time.
(This would occur mainly during thunderstorms following the passage of a lightning stroke. At the ground end, the terminal flash is intense, and vapors, smoke or molten material from objects fused at points struck may enhanoe and extend the duration of incandescence. After-image formed on the retinas of the eyes of a person looking at the brilliant flash at the point of discharge may give spurious effects.)

(3) Brush discharge in air containing high concentration of dust or other aerosols, during thunderstorms.
(If this occurs, it probably is associated with the path taken by a real lightning stroke, and presumably involves corona discharges from suspended particles and possibly combustion in some cases.)

(4) Jumping of gap by lightning indoors.
    (When lightning strikes a house, lightning streamers 
    may jump gaps such as between pipes within the house,
    thus causing a bright flash of limited extent. After-
    image is generally formed on the retina and movements  
    of eye produce apparent movements of the illuminated
    region.)

(5) A cloud-to-ground lightning stroke with an associate,
    horizontally-directed, moving potential wave may
    possibly produce a transient horizontal potential
    gradient sufficiently intense to initiate electrical 
    discharges.
    (Such discharges would involve luminous darts moving
    at high speed and may not over irregular trajectories,
    produce in some cases at least, more-or-less hori-
    zontally directed, sinuous, ribbon-like or tubular 
    paths. If there is a heavy concentration of electrical
    charges near the earth beneath the thunderstorm the
    triggering of a discharge by the transient potential
    gradient may yield horizontal lightning; such lightning
    a relatively slow propagation rate and long duration.)

(6) A lightning discharge that strikes and runs along a
    conductor such as power or telephone lines and flashes-
    over or jumps the gaps at breaks produces a brilliant
    illumination at the gaps that may be mistaken for ball
    lightning.

(7) A piece of wire with attached light object that is car-
    ried aloft by the gusty winds and turbulence attending
    thunderstorm or tornado may serve to facilitate con-
    duction of lightning currents and yield streamers at
    its ends during discharges.

(8) Spurious cases.

    (a) After-image (persistence of vision)
    (b) Will-o'-the Wisp
    (c) Meteorites
    (d) Reflections of lightning observed on highly polished
        objects, such as doorknobs.
    (e) Falling, molten metal

II. Appearance

(a) Forms

Spherical, roughly globular, egg-shaped, or pear-shaped;
many times with projecting streamers of flame-like ir-
regular "masses of light." Appearance of outer boundary
is generally hazy or ill-defined. Photographs of the
phenomenon may show one or several sinuous, tubular pro-
pagation paths (trajectories taken by luminous darts), which
may have associated with them broader luminous spaces of
irregular configuration. (These latter spaces probably
are regions where the sinuosities of path became involved
and tortuous or are areas of major discharge where darts
originated or terminated). Some paths show a beaded struc-
ture (alternate luminous and dark spaces).

(b) Color

Luminous in appearance, described in individual cases by
different colors but mostly reported as deep red or often
as glaring white. One scientist described the color as in a
certain case as similar to that he has noted in the labo-
ratory on observing active nitrogen, or possibly slightly
darker. Another observed one of yellow and still another
of lavendor or rose color. Others have reported some of
blue appearance. The luminous mass is occasionally stated
to be surrounded by a border, hazily but differently-
colored than the main body.

(c) Degrees of Brilliance

Brilliance not glaring; white and incandescent. Mini-
mum brilliance equal to that of feeble St. Elmo's Fire.

(d) Movement through Space

1. Possible directions.

Generally downward, inclined or horizontal, in straight,
curved, or tortuous paths. Mostly observed near the
surface, but may originate in thunderclouds, and so take
a trajectory from cloud to earth.

2. Manoeuvrability

May appear stationary, or moving. Range of speed is
zero to values of the order of 10⁷ cm./sec. In the

latter, extreme case, the luminous darts observed are 
probably of the same general nature as the lightning
streamer, although the paths taken may be very irregular,
and even show reversals in direction. In some
cases, long sections of paths of such luminous darts
may show slight curvature. Near the ground or in
closed spaces a much smaller speed is often said to
be observed, mostly about 1 - 2 meters/sec. The "ball
of fire" may seem to move or float along in a room, or
to roll along the floor. In a thunderstorm, as may be
experienced on a mountain top, an observer has reported
seeing balls of fire roll along the rocks and disappear
from one to another.* Intense St. Elmo's Fire on ship
objects beneath thunderstorms may fluctuate rapidly in
size, intensity, and orientation, or show displacements
from one point to another, hence the flare may appear to
whirl and dance, or move. When a lightning flashover at
a point produces an after-image, or the observer's retina,
movements of the eyes cause corresponding movements of
the image which the untrained observer attributes to
movement of a luminous "ball of fire" or flares. Ball
lightning observed by Jenson1 during the course of a lightning
flash through dust-laden air in the wake of a thunderstorm
"appeared as a shapeless mass of lavender color which
seemed to float slowly downward." Jenson states; "The
rose-colored mass seemed a brilliant near the ground
and gave the impression of most gigantic pyrotechnic display.
Two or three of the globular structures seemed
to roll along a pair of 230 volt power lines for 100
feet or more, then bounded down on the ground and disappeared
with a loud report."

When a lightning streamer from a thundercloud terminates
in the air, the leader stroke is sometimes so faintly
luminous in portions that only a segment of the path is
observed. This may conceivably give the impression of
elongated "ball lightning," but is a natural cloud-air
lightning stroke.

3. Nearby Air or other Craft
-----------------------------
There have been numerous cases of aircraft struck by
lightning. When the aircraft is all-metallic, it serves
as a Faraday cage, and provides electrical protection

to the crew and passengers. Just preceding the onset
of a lightning strike to an aircraft, pilots have re-
ported observing streamers of corona discharge build
up on the nose, propellers or other extremity of the
craft. The movement of the streamer accompanies that
of the aircraft and depends on the passage of a light-
ning stroke nearly or through the aircraft. Corona
discharges on sharply convex surfaces of aircraft have
also been observed during flight between masses of
clouds strongly charged with electrical charges of
opposite sign (positive and negative). Autogenous
charging of the aircraft by the so-called corona precip-
itation during flights through snow or other atmospher-
tation particles intensifies the corona discharges.
These are of the same nature as St. Elmo's Fire.

St. Elmo's Fire has been observed numerous times on
the mastsheads of ships and generally moves with them
during passages beneath thunderclouds or other meteor-
logical conditions where intense electrical potential
gradients exist.

(c) Effect on Surrounding atmosphere

1. Clouds

Lightning of any kind can occur in clouds only if the
dielectric properties of the air are broken down when
the sparking potential gradient is reached. In clear
air this amounts to about 30,000 volts per cm. at sea
level and about 21,000 volts per em. at 10,000 ft.
altitude. In clouds, or in the presence of precipita-
tion particles the sparking potential gradient is less,
depending on the size of the particles. For example,
in the presence of raindrops 1/5 inch in diameter it
is about 10,000 volts/cm.

As shown by Vonnegut, droplets of water suspended in an
electrical field sufficiently intense to induce break-
down will display sparking-over phenomena and will

becomes deformed. Under very strong fields, the drop-
lets become drawn out into filaments and disrupt with
attendant electrical discharges along their services
or through them.

It is probable that these phenomena occur along the
channel of a lightning stroke through a cloud, and that
some evaporation and disruption breakdown of droplets
occur in consequence of the intense heat and flow of
electrical charges. These major effects on cloud or
precipitation particles are believed to be confined to
the lightning channel, although minor effects such as
glow or brush discharges from particles in other portions
of the cloud possibly occur in connection with the de-
velopment of lightning strokes. These discharges from
countless particles may yield a general illumination
within the cloud under storm; electrical field condi-
tions, especially during propagation of lightning strokes.

Effects of "Ball lightning" on clouds are unknown. Since
"ball lightning," if real, is presumably less severe
than ordinary lightning strokes or static bolts prob-
a dart streamer of such a stroke, we may assume that the
effects of "ball lightning" on clouds are not more severe
than those outlined above in connection with lightning.

2. Increased Ionization

The formation of corona discharge at any point leads to
a considerable increase in ionization of the surrounding
air. Any case of so-called "ball lightning" which is
actually a corona discharge will have a similar effect.

Ordinary lightning strokes distribute heavy concentra-
tions of electrons and ions or charged nuclei along and
near their channels during the passage of the stepped
leader or dart leader. These particles form a space
charge surrounding the channel. After the leader reaches
the earth, the return stroke occurs to earth to cloud.
When this develops, the space charge tends to migrate
rapidly to the channel, producing a rush of charges within
it. The flow of these charges in the channel yields the
brilliant, return lightning stroke. Within the channel
ionization is exceedingly heavy.

"Ball lightning" associated with a true lightning stroke
will probably involve a flow of space charges to its

channel and so leads to a diminution of space charge from the environment of the path but an immediate increase of ionization along its path. Following the passage of the phenomenon, ionization will decay by recombination.

3. Nearby Air or Other Craft

All metallic aircraft which are struck by true lightning generally have scorch marks, pits, or holes burned through the skin. The holes rarely exceed one inch in diameter. (See N.A.C.A. Technical Note 0011). Portions of non-metallic material in contact with the area struck may be burnt or explosively separated from the material to which the material is attached. When radio antennas are struck or the lightning transfer does not function as desired, damage to radio equipment often occurs.

Temporary blinding of pilots looking directly at the flash due to the stroke to some exterior portion of the aircraft such as the nose or the fuselage may introduce some hazard. As a rule the temporary blindness is effective from about 10 seconds to a larger fraction of a minute, but in one extreme case a copilot was reported to have been temporarily blinded for about 5 minutes. Several cases of temporary blinding of about 3 minutes have been reported.

The Weather Bureau has not received any reports of accidents in which an airplane was said to have suffered contact with "ball lightning." Judging by the phenomenon called by that name and experienced at the surface, the aircraft damage to be expected by such contact would probably be less severe than that caused by a typical genuine lightning stroke. The type of so-called "ball lightning" which is actually an intense corona discharge would not cause any mechanical damage to non-inflammable exposed materials, but would hamper radio communications by producing static similar to the kind termed "precipitation static."

A real lightning stroke to a non-metallic object on the ground often causes an explosive disruptive effect on the object and will cause burning of inflammable materials.

Contact of so-called "ball lightning" may have physical effects on exposed persons varying from negligible to

fatal. In the cases of fatalities resulting from this
cause, it is believed that genuine lightning was involved.
Physical effects of electrical origin on persons in enclosed
in all-metallic aircraft are negligible, owing to the
Faraday cage protection afforded by the conducting skin.
However, a slight electrical shock may be experienced by
a crew member aboard an aircraft if he is making good
contact at two well separated points during the passage of
the stoop wave front of potential through the area of con-
tact at the time of a real lightning stroke.

(c) Accompanying Phenomena

1. Sound

The origination and dissipation of "ball lightning" at
the surface are often attended by a sharp report, but
not invariably. Very frequently the beginning and end,
respectively, of "ball lightning" is accompanied by a
positively identified stroke of streak lightning or
very nearly so to the point of observation. The thunder
produced by such a stroke will naturally be considered
by many observers to have been associated with the "ball
lightning." "Ball lightning" which is in the form of a
corona discharge makes very little sound, since the cur-
rent carried is very low and the explosive heating effects
on the air negligible. Lightning of the continuing-
current type, with low-wavefront, will not produce intense
sounds, and this is to be more or less expected, also,
of isolated luminous dart streamers traversing the chan-
nels of preceding or succeeding lightning strokes. Such
streamers have been included in the category of "ball
lightning."

2. Chemical Effects

The odor of ozone in connection with "ball lightning" has
been reported by some observers. This is to be expected
in cases where the phenomenon is a brush discharge which
produces ozone in air. When actual streak lightning is
involved, the formation of oxides of nitrogen and ozone
is a normal occurrence.

3. Thermal Effects

Fires have been caused in combustible material, such as
straw, by discharges reported to have been "ball lightning."

Incident #1, lo, ld, 1n - Muroc, California - 8 July 1947

No astronomical explanation for this incident is possible.

It is tempting to explain the objects as ordinary aircraft observed under unusual light conditions, but the evidence of the "tight circle" maneuvers, if maintained, is strongly contradictory.

This incident must be judged with reference to other similar incidents, which probably have a common explanation.

4. Electrical Effects
"Ball lightning" will certainly be accompanied by radio static in some form. Electromagnetic shock to persons is possible when the phenomenon is from to strike lightning. Disruptive mechanical effects on non-conductors especially if containing moisture, or crushing effects on hollow conducting tubes may occur in cases where actual steep wave-front, lightning currents pass through the objects.

5. Optical Appearances
Some of the cases of "ball lightning" observed have displayed exorescences of the appearance of little flames, emanating from the main body of the luminous mass, or luminous streamers have developed from it and pro[illegible] slant-wise toward the ground. In rare instances, it has been reported that the luminous body may break up into number of smaller balls which may appear to follow toward the earth like a rain of sparks. it has often been reported that the ball has suddenly ejected a whole bundle of many luminous, radiating streamers toward the earth, and then disappeared.

Jenson1 has quoted the following report of electrical discharges appear[ing], in a violent storm. "A tornado which occurred on the evening of July 9, 1932, near Rock Rapids, Iowa, gave evidence of a closely related type of luminous display according to the report of Mr. George Raveling, U. S. Weather Bureau observer. From the sides of the boiling, thrust-cloud a fiery stream poured like water through a sieve, breaking into spheres of irregular shape as they descended. No streak lightning of the usual type was observed and no noise attended the fire-balls other than the usual roar of the storm."

(d) Possible Objects to Which Attracted
Lightning strokes are more likely to hit at or near the top of high, pointed objects, than on the surfaces of low objects with flat or concave exteriors. If the tips of the high objects are grounded via conductors such as wires or metal pipes, they will tend to show a higher frequency to strokes than ungrounded objests. This is especially true if, in the former case, the

ground is well moistened or possesses an extensive network of conducting elements (water pipes, telephone and electric cables, etc.)

It follows that the lightning flash will be observed more frequently at these relatively high points than elsewhere, and hence probably that "ball lightning" will appear to develop quite commonly at such points.

Brush discharges tend to form at sharply convex extremities of objects, and align themselves in the direction of the potential gradient. "Tall-grounded conducting objects would generally receive preference. These considerations apply to cases which were classified by the layman as "ball lightning" but actually were cases of St. Elmo's Fire (bright glow or brush discharges).

There have been reports by observers of "ball lightning" to the effect that the phenomenon appeared to 'float through a room or other space for a brief interval of time without making contact with or being attracted by objects.' Filmer and Workman¹ have published a reproduction of moving film camera photographs of unusual discharges during thunderstorms. In the case of the phenomenon observed at Santa Fe, New Mexico (elevation 7000 feet) on the night of September 3, 1936, these authors state "The cameras were mounted rigidly on a bench in a portable laboratory. The discharge was probably about 100 feet from the cameras, although the exact distance is not known since no thunder associated with this flash could be distinguished from the general background of thunder. The discharge occurred within less than one-thousandth of a second after an intense cloud ground stroke at somewhat this portion of the sky. Analysis of the photographs indicates that the discharge consisted of at least four luminous darts moving with a perceived velocity of the order of 10⁵ cm/sec. The most notable features of this discharge are (1) Its irregularity of path and rapid reversals in direction, (2) its proximity to ground objects with no apparent contact with the ground, (3) the bead nature of the path, and (4) the progress of the discharge in two directions from a single point."

Note should be made of the fact that the luminous darts did not appear to be attracted to available ground objects even though they were in the vicinity of the ground. On this basis it cannot be stated whether there are any definite objects to which all cases of "ball lightning" would be attracted. We should think that sharp-pointed, grounded objects are most likely to attract "ball lightning."

(h) Methods of Terminal Dissipation

As a rule so-called "ball lightning" of the variety which we
judge to be intense brush discharge dissipates when the poten-
tial gradient diminishes to a value below the critical one for
maintenance of the discharge. This generally occurs following
lightning strokes which largely discharge the heavy concentra-
tions of electric charges of opposite sign in the overlying
thundercloud.

"Ball lightning" which appears to form at sharp-pointed objects
as a lightning stroke approaches dissipates when (a) the main
lightning current ceases flowing just after contact of the stroke
or (b) the space charge around the lightning channel is largely
collected into the channel and transported to earth or cloud.

"Ball lightning" which appears to be a luminous dart like a
meteorite rapidly falling (or rising) along the path of an
immediately preceding or succeeding lightning stroke disappears
into the earth (or cloud).

"Ball lightning" in the form of a luminous ball apparently moving
through a space or rolling along the ground dissipates eventually,
perhaps on making contact with some object. Some observers have
stated that the ball collapses with a noise resembling that of a
big firecracker, leaving an odor of ozone. It seems probable
that in these cases also the dissipation takes place when the
potential gradient has diminished below the critical value for
maintenance of the discharge, simultaneously with the occurrence
of a genuine lightning stroke to the area involved.

As indicated previously, reports have also been given that the
main body of the "ball lightning" has appeared to have broken up
into a number of smaller "balls" which have fallen to earth, or
to have emitted small streaks, like lightning, projected towards
the earth, and thus dissipated.

A sound of thunder, of greater or lesser intensity, may accom-
pany the dissipation. It is not possible to be certain that the
sound is always intricately connected with the phenomenon, for it
may have been the thunder associated with a nearby lightning
stroke.

Incident No. 76 - 13 August 1947, Salmon Dam, Idaho.

Two men reported simultaneously hearing a roar, and looking up observed two objects of undetermined size, several miles distant at about the height which they thought might have been 1000-2000 feet. The objects were "circular or reflected light", and were travelling at "great speed". Although occurring on the same day as Incident No. 75, the descriptions vary widely.

ATC Opinion: There is no information contained in this report to refute the assumption that these men saw two ordinary aircraft at too great a distance to discern details.

Incident No. 77 - 3 July 1947, 1430 Hours, South Brooksville,

traveling N.W. The group held together with no regular formation. He 
diameter of the sky, chances to remain to recover still 1/20° angular 
diamter in that at a distance of 10 miles the objects would have a 
speed of 1200 MPH; that their width must be 100 feet across and due to 
their color would be barely visible. He also estimated the of 600 
would have a width of fifty feet at five miles with a speed 3,000 MPH. 
He believed they were aircraft of some type, owing to the load roar. 
In his letter he asked, "have any meteorites been reported?"

AFC Opinion: It is believed that the observer should have been 
able to rule out the possibility of meteorites. Reducing the estimate 
of distance, and correspondingly reducing the required size to that of 
objects such as birds or insects, then the speeds become very modest. 
If the objects were actually five to ten miles distant, and responsible 
for the "unusually loud roar", it is expected that numerous other re- 
ports would have been received from this section of Maine, which is 
thickly populated.

Incident No. 79 -- April 1947, Richmond, Virginia
A weather bureau observer at the Richmond Station observed on three dif-
ferent occasions, during the six-month period prior to April 1947, a
disc-like metal chrome object. All sightings were made through a theo-
dolite while making pilot observations. On the last reported sighting,
the balloon was at 15,000 feet altitude, the disc followed for fifteen
seconds. It was shaped like an ellipse with a flat level bottom and a
dome-like top. The altitude and speed were not estimated, but the ob-
ject, allegedly through the instrument, appeared larger than the bal-
loon. Another observer at the same station saw a similar object under
corresponding circumstances, with the exception that her balloon was
at an altitude of 27,000 feet and possessed a dull metallic luster.
There was good visibility on day of observation. Report of this
sighting was not submitted until 22 July 1947.

AMC Opinion: There is no readily apparent explanation. If there
were only one such object, it seems amazingly coincidental that it
would be seen four times near the pbibal of this station only. On the
other hand, there would have to have been a great number of these ob-
jects to rule out coincidence, and as the number of objects increases
so do the chances of sightings by other witnesses.

One observer reported hearing a swishing noise and then seeing, five
shiny objects climbing from 5000 feet to 7500 ft in fifteen to thirty
seconds. He estimated the objects were one mile from him. The lead
object was of plastic appearance and appeared to be towing the other
four. The reporter made a model and exhibited it to an exhibit. The
model is roughly two feet in diameter, domed top and bottom and with an
opening in the rear on either side of a vertical fin. Police records
list the man as having been AWOL from the Navy on two occasions. A
neighborhood employment check disclosed he is an excitable person,
very talkative, easily loses an argument, lacks education, and inclined to
impress people with his continuous verbal chatter.

AMC Opinion: This incident has all the aspects of a psychopath-

Incident No. III — 1 April 1947, 0955 Hours, Central Philippines.
An F-47 pilot leading three other aircraft at 1500 ft saw an object
approximately three miles away at 1000 ft. Object appeared to be a
flying wing thirty by twenty feet, silver in color. The pilot turned
to intercept the object and five seconds or more the ufo's course
and disappeared distant in the object to. Object appeared to have a
dorsal fin but from was too great to note any other features. The
report does not reveal wether any of the other pilots saw the object.

AUG Opinion: No definite ex[illegible]ation. However, every pilot has
experienced the sensation of seeing an aircraft obliquely at nearly the
limit of vision and then losing sight at the same range when the air-
craft presented, in storm view, a smaller surface.

Incident No. 122 - 5 April 1949, Holloman Air Force Base, New
Mexico.
Three balloon observers saw an object very high in the sky, moving
faster than any known aircraft and possessing a rounded distinct form,
which disappeared suddenly. It was seen less than thirty seconds and
was apparently not manned, judging by its violent maneuvers. For an-
alogous size they stated if the moon were the size of an orange, the ob-
ject would approximate the size of a discus.

ATIC Opinion: No explanation. However, the above comparison of
size is to be noted. A disc held at arms length would shield the moon
from the eye even if the moon appeared several times larger that it
does. To reduce the proportion then, this object must have appeared as
an infinitesimal point. From trained observers, this is certainly a
major discrepancy.

Incident No. 14. -- 23 May 1949, 1300 hours, Monroe, Michigan.
One observer in a C-47 at 5000 ft observed three disc-like objects
and later two more (another observer saw only two). The objects
appeared to disappear from above, level off at altitude of C-47 and
travel in the opposite direction at great speed. They left no trail,
were disc shaped and were "silvery-cold" or "shiny brass" in color.
One observer said they were 300-400 feet across with well rounded
contours, the other said they were four feet in size. The first ob-
server later said all had a hazy or fuzzy outline. There was an over-
cast at 15,000 feet and a thin, broken stratus layer at 5000 feet, the
level of the aircraft.

AFO Opinion: Dr. Hynek suggests these individuals could have seen
successive flashes of sunlight through breaks in the high overcast ill-
uminating portions of the lower cloud stratum. Apparent speed could
be a combination of projected motion of the break in the overcast and
the velocity of the C-47. This explanation partially fits the contra-
dictory evidence.

ABSTRACT

A Technical Intelligence Report covering the method of investiga-
tion of unidentified flying objects and results obtained to date is
presented.

The report discusses in full the history of the project, the
problems encountered, and the procedures followed in the investigation
and evaluation of reports of unidentified flying objects. Since the
project is continuous in nature, this report comprehensively treats
reports of sightings only up to January 1949. Work is continuing on
later reports.

Incident #4 – Rogers Dry Lake, California – 8 July 1947

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.

Is there any definite reason why the object observed 

could not have been a bursted weather balloon?

Incident No. 125 - Between 15 and 20 August 1947, 2130 hours,
Waver, South Dakota.

An Air Force officer saw twelve "flying discs" four miles away over the
Rapid City Air Force base in a "tight diamond" formation at 8000 to
10,000 feet descending to 6000 feet at 500 MPH. Objects made a forma-
tion turn and climbed at 90° to 140° alternating. Objects were very 
maneuverable, zooming equally spaced in all manouvers. Each object
was 100 feet in length, oval-shaped and brilliant yellowish-white. No
sound nor exhaust trail were heard or seen.

AC Opinion: This reporter should be a reliable observer. How-
over, it has been shown that distance cannot be estimated without prior
knowledge of the size of an object. If distance is not known, speed
cannot be estimated. More notable perhaps is that such observation
could be re-absorbed in a report made one year after the incident[sic] 
and yet the date was not remembered. Dr. Hynek suggested the possi-
bility of detached auroral streamers.

Incident No. 151 – 29 July 1948, 0955 hours, Indianapolis, In-
diana.
The observers driving a truck saw an object shaped like a broad short
propeller traveling very fast in a bank just above the tress at thirty
feet altitude. It was 20-30 feet long, two feet wide and one foot
thick, with "cups" on the upper sides of the blades. The object
tilted with no spinning action, and there was no sound or trail. The
object was thought to have fallen, but a search revealed nothing.

AC Conclusion: No satisfactory conclusion can be drawn.

Incident No. 152 - 31 July 1948, 0025 Hours, Indianapolis, Indi-
ana.

A man and his wife saw an object shaped like a cymbal, lusterless white
in color, at an altitude of 2000 ft. The object moved across the sky
to the east at approximately 1000 MPH, on a level course and shimmering
in the sun, giving the appearance of spinning. It was twenty foot in
diameter and six to eight foot high in the center. There was no sound
or exhaust.

AUC Opinion; This object could conceivably be the same or dif-
ferent aerofoils as that seen in Incident 154, although all the remaining
evidence is widely divergent. No satisfactory conclusion can be drawn.

Incident No. 154-c 2 August 1945, 1915 Hours, Columbus, Ohio
An attorney and his wife observed an object moving south over the center of Columbus at 1500-2000 ft altitude. During the ten to fifteen minutes the object remained in sight, it changed shape from that of a parallelogram to a circle and back again, direction of travel remained constant. Once it seemed to hesitate and then it fell off. Smoke appeared from the rear. The smoke disappeared soon. The outline of the object was dark gray or black, but the center seemed to be transparent. Object was judged to be 20 to 30 feet in diameter.

AAC Opinion: There is no reason to believe other than that this object was a research balloon, of which there are many types, and that the "trail of smoke" appeared so from a momentary glimpse of trailing sparafti.

Two children, ages ten and eight, described a dull gray object two
feet in diameter and one foot thick, shaped like two plates together
which settled gently to the ground. It clanked when it touched down.
On the ground it emitted a whistling noise and "shot" up to twenty feet
where it hesitated, whistled once more, "shot" up to thirty feet, then
"shot" off in a northeast direction.

ATC Opinion: This apparent bit of fantasy is hardly worth further
consideration.

One observer saw an object intermittently through clouds four times.
The object had two decks and no wings, was said to be very high, with
speed comparable to V-2.

out that the V-2 is not visible in flight, therefore, it follows that
this object would not have been visible as described if travelling at
that speed.

Incident No. 176 -- 23 Sept. 1945, 1200 hours, San Pablo, Calif.
On a warm hay day, Two men saw a large translucent object over a mile
overhead. It was the siez of a four-engine bomber, but "gray in color,
and appeared to be made of wax." According to the first observer,
the amorphous blob was spherical and undulated, having appendages fore
and aft, like an amoeba. The second observer said the object looked
like a "vegetable crate" covered with translucent material. The in-
vestigator states one observer's description was difficult to obtain
since it was over twenty years ago. One wore prescription glasses,
the other, who was seventy, needed glasses to read but wore none at
time of sighting.

AMC Opinion: The only fact that might be accepted is that an ob-
ject was seen. Two observers, side by side, could not agree on its
appearance. The evidence is useless. A balloon or cluster of balloons,
an aircraft, or a cloud could have been the stimulus.

Airborne radar observer in F-51 attempted six times to intercept an object between 5000 and 6000 ft. The object traveled 200 MPH until approach to within 12,000 ft., then quickly accelerated. Pilot saw at estimated 1200 ft. Object appeared to be 20-30 ft. from stop - silhouette to underside of object with rounded nose, general projectile shape, cut off sharply at rear.

AMC Opinion: There is no apparent explanation. One discrepancy seems to be that the target was never seen by ground radar, which was operating and had the F-51 in sight throughout period of sighting.

Incident #5 -- Portland, Oregon -- 4 July 1947

There is no astronomical explanation for this, incident, nor for numerous others (6, 7, 9, 9, 12, 15, 14, 16) which occurred in and near Portland on the Fourth of July, 1947.

Besides being observed in the same vicinity and most of time at the same time, the objects seen have in common a round shape, "ter- rific" speed, abrupt tactics, and quick disappearance. abrupt tactics certainly suggest that the objects were of a very light weight.

This investigator can offer no definite hypothesis, but in passing would like to note that these incidents occurred on the Fourth of July, and that if relatively small pieces of aluminum foil had been dropped from a plane over that area, then any one object would become visible at a relatively short distance. Even moderate wind velocities could give the illusion that fluttering, gyrating discs had come by at great velocities. Various observers would now, of course, in this case have seen the same objects.

The above is not to be regarded as a very likely explanation but only as a possibility! The occurrence of these incidents on July 4 may have been more than a coincidence. Some prankster might have tossed such objects out of an airplane as part of an Independence Day celebration.

If those were aircraft of either known or unknown type,

Incident No. 207 - 16 Nov. 19u0, 2200 hours, Andrews Air Force
Base, "Larry"land.
The pilot of a T-6 reported seeing an object over the base at 1700 feet.
Object was of oblong ball with one light, no wings, no exhaust, and land-
ing lights of T-6. It had a dull gray glow and was thought to be smaller
than the T-6. Pilot made passes and object evaded by going above air-
craft. T-6 tried to close in very tight climbing turns, but object
turned inside the aircraft. Object was lost after ten minutes at 7500
feet. Its speed seemed to vary between 80 MPH and 600 MPH.

AUC Opinion: That the object described was a synoptic balloon.
Dr. Fitt’s report shows that it is very difficult for the observer to
separate target motion and his own motion even in daylight, and prac-
tically impossible to do so at night. This fact has been substantiated
by the writer, who in controlled experiments attacked ordinary balloons
with T-6’s. In daylight, and with knowledge of what the object was and
what it did, all the above described maneuvers were duplicated in ap-
pearance.

Incident #20 -- Xenia, Ohio -- 20 October 1947

The information given here is insufficient to determine
any possible astronomical origin of the object observed.

As in Incident #18, while it is impossible to rule out
the meteoric explanation (e.g., straight course, fast speed), the
lack of information about trail, length of time in sight, manner of
disappearance, and distance from observer, make any attempt at a
definite interpretation rather futile.

Again, in short, it is not impossible that the object seen
was a daylight, slow-moving bolide, but it is highly improbable,
judging from the limited information offered.

Incident #23 – Boise, Idaho -- 30 June 1947

It seems exceedingly probable that the object observed
in this incident was a combination sun-cloud effect. The altitude
of the sun was 30°, azimuth 230°. At that time of the afternoon,
the sun's position was such that it could easily have illuminated
a back round cloud which was perhaps almost entirely covered by a
foreground cloud. (Boise weather reports indicate an entirely
clear sky, but the report of the incident itself states that the
object "seemed to be shining; to a huge cloud.") This investigator
himself has observed such effects.

incident #24 -- weiser, Idaho -- 12 June 1947

There is nothing in the description of this incident that is 
fatal to the hypothesis that the objects observed were parts of a 
"double fireball," but any such identification must remain uncertain.

The most convincing element favoring the meteoric hypothesis 
is the persistent train. Fireballs occasionally leave trains that per-
sist for over an hour.

As far as trajectory is concerned, this is in agreement with 
that to be expected from a meteor on its way out from the sun (it having 
gone toward the sun several weeks previously and now being on its return 
journey toward outer space). Such a fireball would travel relatively slowly, and could appear to "shoot out from the sun" and to travel 
in a southeasterly direction.

The absence of bright flare and of noise is not unusual, since 
reported daylight meteors are frequently not luminous (but do leave a 
trail), and often no noise is heard.

Nor is the fact that there were two such objects fatal to the 
hypothesis. The objects could easily have been single and have broken 
into two, either in its journey around the sun or upon entering the earth's 
atmosphere. There have been several cases of comets that were single 
on their trip toward the sun and double on the way out. Since comets and 
meteors are closely related as far as structure is concerned, the double 
feature is entirely possible.

Incident #23 -- Idaho -- 24 June 1947

Any probable astronomical explanation for this incident is dependent upon the hour of observation, which is not stated in the information given with the summary.

An unconfirmed statement (by Dr. Archam, quoted in material submitted relative to Incident #101) that the observation was made at 3:30 P. M. allows for no possible astronomical explanation other than that a persistent meteor train may have been observed. Such a phenomenon might have given the general impression suggested by the limited description of the incident.

If, however, the observation occurred during the early evening hours, shortly after sunset, which occurred that day at about 8:00 P. M. local time, then it is extremely likely that Lt. [Redacted] saw either the planet Saturn or Mercury. Mercury set almost exactly an hour after the sun and was of stellar magnitude +1. Saturn, of magnitude +0.6 and hence about once again as bright as Mercury, set two hours after the sun. A bright planet shining through thin cirrus clouds could give the impression of a "rocket-like object."

SUMMARY

While there are approximately 375 incidents on record, only incidents Nos. 1 thru 244 are encompassed in this report. Of the later incidents, many have not yet been investigated, few have been completely tabulated, and none have been submitted to the consulting agencies. It is certain that better over-all results will be obtained in the analysis of the later reports, as these incidents generally have been more completely investigated.

Since 5 December 1948, a series of recurring phenomena described as "green fireballs" have been reported in the general vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Dr. Lincoln La Paz, noted meteoritic expert, has been directly, though unofficially, associated with the investigation of those sightings and has himself observed the phenomena. Dr. La Paz states he is convinced the green fireballs are not ordinary meteors. This group of incidents has little or nothing in common with other incidents on file with Project "Grudge"; therefore, these incidents are not considered in this report. The Secretary of the Air Force (on 15 Jan 49) asked to investigate this matter and had advised that an independent investigation be conducted in the Field of astrophysics research.

Upon eliminating several additional incidents due to vagueness and duplication, there remain 228 incidents which are considered in this report. Thirty of these could not be explained, because there was found to be insufficient evidence on which to base a conclusion.

Consulting agencies provided plausible solutions for 164 incidents, along with the following comments and findings:

Rand Inc. — (172 Incidents considered) "We have found nothing which would seriously controvert simple rational explanations of the various phenomena in terms of balloons, conventional aircraft, planets, meteors, bits of paper, optical illusions, practical jokers, psychopathological reporters, and the like."

Ohio State University (Dr. Hynek - 244 Incidents considered) Assuming evidences of observers and investigators to be correct, Dr. Hynek concluded that 32% could be explained astronomically, 35% could be attributed to balloons, aircraft, rockets, birds, etc., and 33% either lacked necessary evidence or a suitable explanation was not apparent. When due allowance was made for inaccuracies in observing and reporting, 53% might be explained astronomically.

Air Weather Service (233 Incidents considered)

12.0% apparently were weather balloons.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #20, Case# - Lockbourne AFB, Columbus, Ohio -- 7 January 1948

Considering this incident with #32, 35, and 43, one is forced to conclude that the object observed from Lockbourne Army air base on the evening of 7 January 1948 was the planet Venus.

One report of the incident gives the location of the object as 210°-220°, or approximately opposite from that stated by other observers and that of Venus. Obviously, since the time of observation was the same, this means that one witness either was looking at a different object or had his directions mixed. Since the description otherwise agrees generally with the rest, and since it is assumed throughout the reports that all observers were viewing the same object, the latter interpretation seems presumable.

Witnesses state that the object "couldn't have been a star" (of course, it wasn't), because the sky was completely overcast. However, reports from the Columbus weather bureau indicate that, although the afternoon was cloudy, the sky was clear by 1900 hours. (This does not mean, of course, that there were no clouds near the western horizon.)

For possible explanations of the "baffles" reported by observers of this object, and further discussion of the incident, see report on #33.

Please note that the document seems to be a historical record of an investigation into a UFO sighting, and the conclusion provided in the document suggests that the observed object was the planet Venus.

Incident #30, et. al. - Godman Field, Fort Knox, Kentucky -- 7 January 1948
a discussion of all incidents reported for this date

Incidents #30, 32, 33, and #3 all occurred on 7 January 1948,
with #33 involving the death of Lieutenant Mantell. National attention
has therefore been given to various astronomical body or phenomenon
which might serve to identify the object or objects observed. The four
incidents are considered together here.

Although the several reports differ considerably in regard to
the bearing and motion of the object (assuming for the moment that the
afternoon and evening sightings refer to the same phenomenon), they are
generally consistent concerning its time, manner, and place of its dis-
appearance over the horizon. Four and six-tenths are given as 1503 CST,
about 210 ̊, by observers at Godman Field; 1655 EST, west southwest, by
those at Lockbourne Air Base; and 1655-2000 EST, south about 210 ̊, by those
at Clinton County Air Base, (there are, as is to be expected, slight
differences in individual reports). Using this for the focal point of
attack, one notes immediately that all these times and bearings tie up
closely with the time and place of the setting of Venus. Furthermore,
all accounts except one agree that the object was low in the southwest
before the time of disappearance. Reports vary as to details of its
motion, but the overall motion was southwest and then over the horizon.

These facts taken together preclude any question of coincidence. Fur-
thermore, simultaneous observation from scattered locations proves that
the object had negligible parallax, or, in short, that it was a very
great distance away. All other statements concerning the object must,

Incident #33 is t^e only one of the four that includes
the daytime observation of presumably, the same object. The im-
portance of the incident is, hov/ever, para^ount, for it was in
tracking down the mysterious object that Lieutenant Mantell lost

his life. Again it is possible that th,e object observed was the
planet Venus, althouii t.ie evidence is by no means so definite
as that for the sighting made later that day. First, the hearings
of the object as reported by various witnesses differ considerably;
where one says southwest, another says south, for i;.e eao ^.istak 
ing Venus, differ;ntiat-; all th^ evidence, one i^^ a Jnin struck with tne 
coincidences of: th.e object's position with that of Venus. The fol-
lowing short table of sighting vs tim position of Venus shows tne 
general ap^roximat; of the tivo.in azimuth:

A more pertineat question is that of whether it would have
been possible to see Venus in the daytime on that day. All that can
be said here is that it  was not impossible to see the planet under
those conditions. It is well known that when Venus is at its greatest
brilliancy, it is possible to see it durin.; the dayti:^ whoa one knows
exactly where to look, but on kthutary 7, 1948 Venus was less than half

as bright as it is when most brilliant. However, under exceptionally
good atmospheric conditions and with the eye shielded from the direct
rays of the sun, Venus might be seen as an exceedingly tiny bright point
of light. It can be shown that it was definitely brighter than the
surrounding sky, for on this date in question Venus had a solid-angulated 
of 9 seconds of arc, or a total apparent surface area of approximately
125 square seconds. Assuming that a square second of sky would be a
trifle brighter than the fourth magnitude, a portion of the sky of the
same area presented by Venus would be about -.i.-i.a. magnitude. Since the
planet, however, was -.-., it was 5 times brighter than an equivalent
area of sky. While it is thus physically possible to see Venus at such 
times, usually its pinpoint character and the large expanse of sky
makes its casual detection very unlikely; i.e., however, a person happens
to look toward a point on the sky that is just a few minutes of arc
from the position of Venus, he is apt to be startled by its apparition
and to wonder who didn't also see it before. The chances, of course, of
looking at just the right spot are very few. Once done, however, it is
usually fairly easy to relocate the object and to call the attention of
others to it. However, atmospheric conditions must be exceptionally
good. It is improbable, for example, that Venus would be seen under
these circumstances in a large city.

It can be said, therefore, that a possible explanation for
the object sighted in the daytime in Incident #33, ae, -- is that it

too was the 'planet' Venus. In the absence of exact measurements, however,
it is impossible to establish t, at it was or was not. (It is un-
fortunate that theodolite measures of the afternoon observations were
evidently not made.)

It has been unofficially reported that the object was a
navy cosmic ray balloon. If this can be established, it is to be
preferred as an explanation. However, it one accepts the assumption
that reports from various other locations in the state refer to the
same object, any such device must have been a good many miles if --
2 to 50 -- in order to have been seen clearly, almost simultaneously,
from places 175 miles apart.

It is entirely possible, of course, that the first sightings
were o some sort of balloon or aircraft, b.t that when those reports
came to Jodman Field, a careful scrutiny of the sky revealed Venus,
and it could be that Lieutenant Mantell did actually 'give chase to the
planet, even though whatever object had been in the course of the exite-
ment elsewhere had disappeared. At the altitudes that the pilot
reached, Venus would have been very much more easily observed than
from the ground, and it might even be that he did not actually pick
it up until he was at a considerable altitude. The one piece of
evidence that leads this investigator to believe that at the time of
Lieutenant Mantell's death he was actually trying to reach Venus is

Incident #47 -- Fairfield-Suisun AFB, California - 3 Jul, 1947

This incident cannot be readily explained astronomically.
The object was in sight too long to be a meteor, and the variable
"reflection" and absence of any statement about trail also argue
against that interpretation. It is difficult, however, to rule
out the hypothesis completely, because of the lack of pertinent
information and the ever-present possibility that the reporting
was more subjective than objective.

There is some confliction as to whether the objects or
the one trail preceded the trail. The trail was visible for fif-
teen minutes. If the object itself was, it could not have been
a meteor, but the gist of the report seems to indicate that only
the trail was visible for any length of time. In that case, it
could have been either the trail from a meteor or from an aircraft. Description is not sufficient to distin-
guish the two. Other observers (not those reported) have indicated that the object was a jet, flying along with a vapor
trail, but this does not necessary exclude the meteor's hypo-
thesis, because of the general unfamiliarity of the public with
such phenomena.

initials: acv – near Red Liver, Oregon – 11 [REDACTED] or late

The gist of this incident is that a 'flash' of light was
seen and a terrific sound of explosion heard at about 2115 on
a rainy evening. Clearly this description could apply to any
type of explosion, such as 'unit' of a demolition dump or factory;
however, it is true that when a bolide explodes a blinding flash
or light is seen, and tremendous sounds are sometimes heard for
many seconds. Since this was observed at the time of this in-
cident, and a light rain was falling, the earlier part of the
trail of the fireball (if that is what it was) was, of course,
not visible; only the flash from the final explosion, which
would have appeared essentially stationary, was seen.

In the absence of positive evidence of any other type
of explosion occurring in that vicinity at the time, it is the
opinion of this investigator that a bolide explosion was observed.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
  
What, in particular, was gathered from the evidence con-
cerning the astronomical character of the objects observed?
  
Of the 244 incidents submitted, 7 are excluded from all
statistical reckoning: 1 is identified (in the subject report) as
a hoax, 3 are duplicates, and 3 contain no information. In sum-
marizing the findings in the remaining 237, two systems of classi-
fication are possible:
  
First, all incidents can be placed in one of two classes:
  
1) those which under no stretch of the imagination can be regarded
as astronomical or extra-terrestrial (extra-terrestrial throughout
this investigation refers solely to natural objects not originating
on earth; it does not include "space ships from other planets"),
and 2) those which either are definitely astronomical or can by
suitable manipulation of the evidence be construed as such. The
object here is to segregate all cases in which any vestige of astro-
nomical origin is indicated. When this division is made, 111, or
47%, fall into the definitely non-astronomical category, or, con-
versely stated, 126, or 55%, might conceivably be considered (al-
though the likelihood of their being so is very very small) as
extra-terrestrial or astronomical in origin. The exact percentage
is not important. The significant thing is that over 50% of the
incidents might possibly be explained astronomically, if wide enough
tolerances were allowed.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incidents 942 -- Los Alamos, New Mexico -- 6 January 1949

The information offered concerning this incident is 
brief, and there was only one observer. According to the descrip-
tion, a brilliant point light-approach it was seen low on the
horizon for about two seconds, enough was "lit up" showing that
that of a meteor. In view of this survey (study), no definite
conclusion can be drawn.

It was not for the fact that this incident appears to
belong in the fall of new-explode "green fireballs," the ob-
jects could be considered to have been a slow meteor, even though the
time of night or day shift does not favor that hypothesis.
It is much more probable, however, that this incident falls into
the pattern of those dealt with in detail in the OJ report on inci-
dent #926. See that report for further discussion.

The subject described here wants to place to the mysterious fall of slow moving "green fireballs." See report on incident #223 for detailed discussion.

It can be said, however, that if this is regarded as an isolated incident, the assertion is not yet, different from that of a fireball. It is the occurrence of these incidents in a seemingly definite pattern, that is now shown by indices the interolic hypothesis.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident 2044 - Kirtland Field, Albuquerque, New Mexico - 12 November 1948

The evidence given concerning this incident does not seem
to either physical; if the object was a bird it will eliminate, distance
disqualified two foot long and only a bird of this family, that is quite
unidentifiable that it should have been observed over such a sec trajectory,
and as bright as that, that close, in a populated spot, should/would have
attracted the attention of many to one degree.

The vaudeville routines casts a psychological jumble optical illusion
mirror than a real object in the sky. The evidence is ambiguous, 
thus it is it is not swayed, nor is it observable or reasoning on the 
object even if slide, the angle of climb, average is not told till
at a high pitch, to disintegrate, or did it fade out gradually, or
what?

There is a remote possibility that the observer saw an iden-
it in its mother overgrown silent part of its trajectory, but if this
had been the case, then should have been some sort of a trail.

The method of reporting and stenography in this incident
is very poor. It would seem that if the observer was aware enough to
note a zenith of arc and a trajectory of 500', he would also know about
the bearing and elevation of the object and its manner of disappearance.

The whole incident lacks some sort of physical reality.

may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that
has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except
that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball
lightnings. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are
conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are
checked by the Intelligence Department of this Command. These checks
are usually made direct from the Project "SIGN" office. MCIAKO-3. These

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, CIAGS, 
dated 9 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first 
indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incident summaries 173 through 233 have been checked 
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy 
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation of Uni-
dentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Direction 
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is 
specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Sottings" should include a statement of the type of 
radar set used.

The primary purpose here, however, is to segregate inci-
dents which have a reasonable degree of certainty of astronomical
origin. Therefore, in a second, more detailed breakdown, incidents
are placed in one of three classes, according to the most probable
interpretation seen in the evidence offered (with a minimum of
allowance for subjective observation). Class 1 includes the astro-
nomical incidents (with degree of probability indicated). The non-
astronomical incidents are divided into two classes, because it
appeared as the work progressed that they fell naturally thus: in
some, the evidence at hand suggested a simple explanation; in others,
it did not. Listings under class 2 are not to be considered in any
way decisive (with the exception of a few which, according to sub-
ject reports, have been definitely identified); they are offered
as suggestions.

A summary of the results of this breakdown is shown in
the table on the following page.

No. 173. Rawinsondes released from Barksdale AFB at 1500 CST.
Shreveport under influence of very light flow of a local nature which
extended through the 500 mb. level. In all probability, rawinsonde
balloon that was circular following its oblique vertical winds.
These balloons soon approximately two hours later in the same area.
Assuming; a balloon leak, not altogether uncommon, this rawinsonde could
have remained low enough to be seen. Winds reported as high as 70K
account for speed. Conclusion: Rawinsonde balloon.

No. 174. Forecast pilot balloon sounding release was at Lake Charles
at 0300 CST. Wind flow much in lower levels, chartr. to SSW with aliti-
tudo. No winds of high enough velocity to carry pilot balloon sounding
from Lake Charles to New Orleans in time interval was reported. Only 
other release in the area was at isloxi, North of New Orleans. Winds
aloft were WSW. Speed estimated at observer of 300 M.P.H. is approxmately
15 times greater than any wind reported for that area. Conclusion: Not
a balloon.

No. 175. Pilot balloon sounding released from Albuquerque at same
time as observation. Upper winds show WNW flow hence could not have been
the AB balloon. Great differences of opinion exist as to speed and shape
of the object. One observer states that the object was not a weather
balloon. All evidence indicates that this is true. Conclusion: Not a 
balloon.

No. 176. Navy rawinsonde and Weather Bureau pilot balloon sounding
were released approximately one hour prior to sighting. Wind flow, how-
ever, was NW at all levels from the surface to 15,000 feet which would
seem to preclude the possibility of either balloon drifting; North to the
San Pablo area. Both witnesses also agree that the object was travelling
at high speed. Winds for that region did not exceed 25 K. Conclusion; 
No balloon.

No. 177. Crack-pot report; insufficient information to evaluate.

No. 178. No weather balloons were released in the vicinity on the
date mentioned.

No. 179. Crack-pot report; insufficient information to evaluate.

No. 180. No date given hence no analysis possible.

Here is the text from the document:

```
No. l6l. This obviously inaccurate report says in effect that
the object was seen about 30 minutes after pilot balloon sounding and
rawinsonde release time. From the known release points, wind direction
and speed at the level mentioned, this object or objects could not
possibly have been a weather balloon.

No. 162. Two balloons released within 120 miles of this position,
but if wind were from west it could have been a leaking balloon from
Norfolk or Lakeview which was not rising as it should. However, the
date of incident cannot be read from the questionnaire, hence no definite 
conclusion can be drawn.

No. 163. Purely a radar report. If this report is accurate, couldn't
possibly be a balloon.

No. l64 - 165. Very controversial accounts of speed (0 - 3 times that
of a Jet); closest fits sounds like a burning: pilot balloon sounding, with
lantern. However, nearest release was two hours earlier at St. Cloud.
Could have been this pilot balloon sunning, but likely the balloon too
keep it at a low altitude. Not at all probable, but possibly a balloon.

No. 166. Object reported moving directly into headwind of 20G. Only
possible weather balloon could be hours moving SE from Salt Lake City.
If speed is any criterion, this was definitely not a balloon.

No. 167. A heavenly body, Venus.

No. 168. No actual sightings; a radar report, if accurate, definitely
no weather balloon.

No. 169. Rawinsondes released at Montgomery and Atlanta 1 1/2 hours
earlier and would have been blown into sighted area by upper winds. Only
a faulty balloon, however, could have descended to that low altitude.
From description, balloon is most unlikely.

No. 190. Every indication seems to point to this object being a
rawinsonde balloon. Lawinsonde scheduled to be released from Munich
approximately one hour previous to sighting. Very light winds in Munich
area. Definitely a balloon.

No. 191. Only balloon released in wind pattern that would carry it
over Junction City was released at Dodge City approximately one hour
before sighting time. If reported direction and speed of object were at
all accurate, balloon not possible.

No. 192. Balloons released from St. Cloud and Duluth just prior to
sighting. Wind perfect for carrying balloon into observer's path. Wind

reported at 30K at about 60° to 110°. Steadily risin; is also in- 
dicative of weather balloon.

No. 193. No date given; very little information; cannot de-
termine 00/30ct.

No. 194. Definite identity established by N.I.I.

No. 195. Very little information, only radar blip; cannot de-
termine E weather balIoon or not.

No. 196. Radar scope observation only; object travelling directly
into wind. Cannot determine if balloon, but unlikely.

No. 197. Almost certainly the coaet discovered by the Sydney
astronomer. No balloon could have reached Richm.tnd at the time the
object was sighted inasmuch as the sighting trne and release time
were almost simultaneous.

No. 196. No visual observation; radar blip moving at high speed
and constantly ch1:mging direction. If radar report is accurate,
couldn't possibly be a balloon.

No. 199. Wind, time and numbr: of objects sighted.rule out pos-
sibility of weather balloons.

No. 200. Definitely not weather balloon. Course southerly, wind
almost due North at all levels. Orly station releasing balloon in this
area is North of Crescent City.

No. 201. Pilot balloon sounding released from Azores station at
0300 LT. Title of sight "bout" that time. Description sounds very much
like lighted pilot balloon sounding. Only discRrpancy is speed which
is reported from 25 M.P.H. to 500 M.P.H. If the lower speed is cor-
rect, ob,iect may be almost certainly assured to be a weather balloon.

No. 202. Time of sighting was five hours after last scheduled
release time for any rawin or pilot balloon sounding, thus discounting
a balloon leask, would put it far too high for easy sightings. Defir-
nately not a weather balloon.

No. 203. Again last scheduled release was over five hours prior
to sighting. Only possibility, and a definitely unlikely one, is a
lighted balloon falling in flames from an extremely high altitude.

No. 204. Venus.

No. 205. No date given on this, therefore, impossible to check
wind Flow pattern. Time, two hours after scheduled release time for.
Kansas City, Colymbia, and St. Louis, Mo. balloons.

No. 205. If description is accurate, i.e., "wings on fuselage,"
roar of engine, circling object, possibility of weather balloon is
remote. Also, latest time of release for Clark Field was four hours
prior to sighting. Also, note F.B.I. to move character of observer.

No. 207. Definitely not a weather balloon.

No. 206. Object sighted about four hours after last scheduled
release time. Upper air flow pattern gives no indication of possibility
of weather balloon drifting in from another station. Also balloon would
have to have loitered to remain at 30,000 ft.

No. 209. Determined to have been twin-engined bomber.

No. 210. Summary sheet missing; no altitude given; time incorrect,
pattE3n' WEF 5ot snedulod balloon release time. If direction is correct,
objects were flying into the wind. Cannot be determined conclusively.
Inclined to bol1evp objects were Jet aircraft.

No. 211. Very Pistol.

No. 212. Object sighted three hours after release time of similar-
apolis and Ft. Wayne balloons. Defective balloon could have rationalized
low earth to be seen and upper winds indicate that such a balloon would
have been in the Dayton area at the time sighted. All other statements
of observers seem to indicate that the object was a weather balloon.

No. 213. Evidently refers to the same object as in Incidents No. 212,
but with entirely different description. If so, if accurate, raises con-
sideration. Or 212 obviously incorrect. If not same object, certainly
not a weather balloon, as definite pattern not major, as described, not
possible under existing wind flow conditions.

No. 214. No information whatsoever.

No. 215. Very high winds 70-70 m.p.h. from SW at all levels,
definitely would have prohibited any balloon from making any southerly
motion. Also, last scheduled released time was three hours prior to
sighting at 1,000 feet. No time in sight given so balloon out of rate
of climb to 20,000 foot. Fairly conclusively, not a balloon of any kind.

No 216. Object reported moving directly into 70 M.P.H. head
winds at an estimated 350 M.P.H. Observer is a professional weather
observer and should know a weather balloon. Also, reported sighting
was four hours after scheduled release time.

No. 217. Object reported movin4 two miles of 200-300K velocity and going faster than C-47 doing 120 M.P.H. The speeding direction are apparently very accurate since the C-47 was paralleling this object's course and several soldiers crew cluding the pilots, saw the speed indicator. If report is true, definitely no balloon.

No. 216J No date ~iven, consequently no check could be made of surface or upper-air date. As stated by observer, & flare is probable answer.

No. 219. Time of sighting coincides within a few minutes of the release time of the USAF rawinsonde at Newburgh and the pilot balloon sounding at New York. Very little description, however the entire interpreted as either being a burning balloon or a star. One cant be certain was was that the object moved from west to east, an impossible situation for a balloon since wind at all levels were westerly.

No. 220. Wind at all levels N. to NW.; object reported flying directly into these winds. Also m&e definite turn from flying due Horth to North Northwest. Sighting time 1 1/2 hours after scheduled release times at Alameda, Sacramento and "O'callahan AFB.

No. 221. To informantior.

No. 222. Winds aloft charts not available on this cnse. Object sighted 2 1/2 hours after scheduled release - at which time it was plotted by a radar DP station to be at 27,000 A short time later the same station reported the object circling at 10,000; speed estimated at between 200-500 "M.P.H. Most likely not a balloon.

No. 223. Definitely not a scheduled release balloon since it was seen to pass by the ground crew here before hours time after the circling and was since from Yuma personnel a saw to two passing at its previous sighting. Seventeen individuals saw and reported this object as definitely a green flare. All commercial and government airfields questioned concerning balloon releases with no success.

No. 224. Described exactly as that in No. 223, only at an altitude of 13,500 feet then Sea Level, 1,000 foot above the earth. Seen 2 1/2 hours after scheduled balloon release time. Wind at levels from 10,000 to 15,000 was NNW while flare was reported as travelling at very high speed in a WSW direction. Very accurate observation made by two F.3.1. agents. Definitely not a weather balloon.

No. 225. No date ::iven. Object sighted within 15 minutes of release time of Pilot balloon soundings at Albuquerque at low altitude, 500 feet. Exploded in red spray at 200 feet. This exact phenomena occurred on three different occasions at the same time which would seem to eliminate possibility of burning; weather balloon.

       balloon.

No. 231. Another glowing, green flare just as described above.

No. 232. Investigation dropped.

No. 233. Definitely no balloon; made turns, definite fuselage,

Some Considerations Affecting the Interpretation of Reports

of Unidentified Flying Objects

SOME CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE INTERPRETATION OF REPORTS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.

By 
H. M. Vallée, member Scientific Advisory Panel,
Office of the Chief of Staff, United States air forces.

The writer has studied summary abstracts and comments pertaining to unidentified flying objects, which were forwarded by Air Force Intelligence. These summaries are divided into three main parts; The first part is a short summary of the reports; the second part consists of a general survey of various possibilities of accounting for the reports; the third part contains certain recommendations for future action.

PART I SHORT SUMMARY OF OBSERVATIONS.

The reports can be grouped as follows:

Group 1. The most numerous reports indicate the daytime observation of metallic disk-like objects, roughly in diameter ten times their thickness. There is some suggestion that the cross section is asymmetrical and rather like a turtle shell. Reports agree that these objects are capable of high acceleration and velocity; they often are sighted in groups, sometimes in formation. Somethings they flutter.

Group 2. The second group consists of reports of lights observed at night. These are also capable of high speed and acceleration. They are less commonly seen in groups. They usually appear to be sharply defined luminous objects.

Group 3. The third group consists of reports of various kinds of rockets, in general appearing somewhat like V-2 rockets.

Group 4. The fourth group contains reports of various devices which, in the writer's opinion, are sounding balloons of unusual shape such as are made by the General Mills Company to Navy Contract.

**OCR Transcription of the Text:**

Group 5. The fifth group includes reports of objects to which little 
credence can be placed.

General Remarks.

In general, it is noted that few if any reports indicate that the ob-
served objects made any noise or radio interference, nor were there many 
indications of any material effects or physical damage attributable to 
the observed objects.

SUMMARY, PART I.

This report will consider mainly the reports of groups 1 and 2.

PART 2. ON POSSIBLE EXPLANATION OF THE PHENOMENA.

Section A. Thats can be deduced concerning the entry of unknown aerial 
objects from a single sighting.

There are two problems: first, how much can be deduced concern-
ing the nature of the objects from observational calculations alone; second, 
how much more can be deduced if, in addition, it is assumed that the ob-
jects obey the laws of nature as we know them.

Concerning this first problem, it can be stated that only ratios of 
lengths, and rates of change of such ratios can be accurately determined. 
Thus the range and size of such objects cannot be determined, and it is 
noticeable that reports of size of the observed objects are widely var-
iable. However, angles, such as the angle subtended by the object, can 
be observed. Likewise, there is fair agreement among several observers that 
the diameter of the objects of Group 1 is about ten times their thickness. 
Although velocity cannot be determined, angular velocity can be, and in 
particular the flutter frequency could, in principle, be determined.

All that can be concluded about the range and size of the objects, from 
geometrical considerations alone, is 1) from the fact that estimated

sions are; so well, the objects were actually either of "Aircraft sizes,
or more likely, that they were far enough from the observers so that bin-
ocular vision produced no stereoscopic effect; this only means that they
were farther off than about thirty feet; 2) size objects were seen to
disappear behind trees, buildings, clouds etc, they are large enough to
be visible at the ranges of those roundish-white objects.

That it is evidently of prime impo~nce to estimate the size and mass
of the observ(~ objects. This may be possible to some extent if it is
permissable to assume that they obey the laws of physics. Since the ob-
jects have not been observed to produce any physical effects, other than
the one case in which a cloud was demonstrated along the trajectory, it is
not certain that the laws of mechanics, for instance, would be sufficient.

But 9uppose that mechanical laws alone are sufficient. Then the
following example is sufficient proof that at least a lorth could, in
principle, be determined: suppose a simple pendulum were observed sus-
pended in the sky; then after observing its frequency of oscillation, we
could deduce from the laws of mechanics its precise length.

This ~uests that something could be deduced from the observed flutter-
ing motion of some of the objects of group 1. Assume that we know the ang-
ular frequency and angular amplitudes of this fluttering motion (they can be
measured in principle from a motion picture). Then for purposes of calculation
assume the object to be thirty feet in diameter, to be as rigid as a normal
aircraft wing of 30 foot span, to be constructed of material of the optimum
weight-strength ratio and to be a structure of most efficient design. It
is now possible to calculate how heavy the object must be merely to remain
rigid under the observed angular motion. Let the calculation be made
for a plurality of assumed eL1ess 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 ------ up to say

According to those findings, 78, or almost one-third, of
the 237 incidents yet remain without an appropriate hypothesis for
explanation. It is likely, of course, that with additional evidence
a number of those included in class 3a would be easily explained (some
of them, probably, astronomically). There are, however, at least 46
incidents in which the evidence, if correct as given, does not fit any
simple explanation, and a number of these were reported by presumably
well-qualified observers.

200 feet, and let en1culated mass be plotted versus asqured size. The non-
linear character of the curve should indicate an approximate upper limit to
the size of the object.

If in addition, it is assumed that the flutter is due to aerodymamic
forces, it is possible that more precise information could be obtained.
The required angular data can probably be extracted from witnesses
most reliably by the use of a demonstration model which can be made to
oscillate or "flutter to a known way.

SUMMARY, PART 2, SECTION A.

Geophysical oscillations alone do not yield the size of objects ob-
served from a single station; such observation, together with the as-
sumption that the objects are essentially aircraft, can be used to set
reasonable limits to size.

PART II, SECTION 5. THE FEASIBILITY OF SUPPORTING AND PROPELLING A SOLID
OBJECT BY "RAYS".

Since some observers have obviously colored their reports with talk
of rays, jets, beams, space-ships, and the like, it is well to examine
what possibilities exist along those lines. This is also important in
view of the conclusions of part II, section 4 of this report.

PROPELLER. Propulsion and support by means of "rays" or "beams".
By "rays" or "beams" are meant either purely electromagnetic radiation
or also radiation which is largely corpuscular like cathode-rays or cosmo-
rays or cyclotron-beams.

Now it is obvious that any device propelled or supported by such means
is fundamentally a reaction device. It is fundamental in the theory of such
devices that a given amount of energy is most efficiently spent if the momen-
tum thrown back or down is large. This means that a large mass should

be given a small acceleration - a theorem well understood by helicopter
designers.

The beams or rays mentioned do the contrary - a small mass is given
a very high velocity - consequently enormous powers - greater than the total
world's power capacity - would be needed to support even the smallest object
by such means.

METHOD II. Direct use of Earth's Magnetic Field.

One observer (incident #x) noticed a violent motion of a hand-held
compass. If we assume from this that the objects produced a magnetic
field, comparable with the Earth's field, namely 0.1 gauss, and that the
observer found that the object subtended an angle at his position, then
the ampereturns of the required electromagnet is given by

   nI = 30 R
   --        where R is the range of the object.
   Q2

For instance, if R is one kilometer and the object is 40 meters in diameter,
then nI = 1 billion ampereturns.

Now if the object were actually only 10 meters away and were correspond-
ingly smaller, namely 10 cm in diameter, it would still require 10 million
ampereturns.

These figures are a little in excess of what can be conveniently done
on the ground. They make it seem unlikely that the effect was actually
observed.

Now the Earth's magnetic field would react on such a magnet to produce
not only a torque but also a force. This force depends not directly on
the Earth's field intensity but on its irregularity or gradient. This
force is obviously minute since the change in field over a distance of
10 meters (assumed diameter of the object) is scarcely measurable - more-
over the gradient is not predictable but changes due to local ore deposits.

There are no photographs in the image provided. The text from the document is as follows:

Thus even if the effect were large enough to use it would still be unreliable and unpredictable.
METHOD III. Support of an Electrically Charged Object by Causing it to Move Transverse to the Earth's Magnetic Field.
A positively charged body moving from West to East, or a negatively charged body moving from East to West will experience an upward force due to the Earth's magnetic field.
A sphere 10 meters diameter moving at a speed of one kilometer/second would experience an upward force of one pound at the equator if charged to a potential of 5 x 10^12 volts. This is obviously ridiculous.
METHOD IV. ANTI-GRAVITY SHIELD.
It has been proposed, by various writers, perhaps first by H. G. Wells, that it might be possible to construct a means of shielding a massive body from the influence of gravity. Such an object would then float. Recently there appeared in the press a notice that a prominent economist has offered to support research or such or otherwise.
Obviously, conservation of energy demands that considerable energy be given the supported object in order to place it on the shield. However this amount of energy is in no way prohibitive, and therefore it can be gotten back when the object lands.
Aside from the fact that we have no suggestions as to how such a device is to be made, the various theories of general relativity all agree in assuming that gravita[tional] force and force due to acceleration are indistinguishable, and from this assumption the theories predict certain effects which are in fact observed. The assumption therefore is probably correct, and a corollary of it is essentially that only by means of an acceleration can gravity be counteracted. This we can successfully do

for instance by making an artificial satellite - but this presumably is not what has been observed.

SUMMARY, PART II, SECTION B.

Several unorthodox means of supporting or propelling a solid object, have been considered - all are impracticable. This finding lends credence to the tentative proposed assumption of Part II, that the objects are supported and propelled by some normal means, or else that they are not solids. No discussion of the type of Part II, Section C. can, in principle, of course, be complete.

PART II, SECTION C. POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THE REPORTS.

CLASSIFICATION I. NATURAL TERRESTRIAL PHENOMENA.

1) The observations may be due to some effect such as ball lightning. The writer has no suggestions on this essentially meteorological subject.

2) The objects may be some kind of animal. Even in the celebrated case of incident 172 where the light was chased by a P-51 for half an hour and which was reported by the pilot to be intelligently directed, we can make this remark. For consider that an intelligence capable of making so remarkable a device would not be likely to play around in so idle a manner as is described by the pilot.

In this connection it would be well to examine if some of the lights observed at night were not fire-flies.

3) The observed objects may be hallucinatory or psychological in origin. It is of prime importance to study this possibility because we can learn from it something of the character of the population; its response under attack; and also something about the reliability of visual observation.

One would like to assume that the positions held by many of the ro-

rented observers guarantee their observations. Unfortunately there were
many reports of curious phenomena by pilots during the war - the incident
of the fire-ball Mi-fighters comes to mind. Further, PJAirriors have been re-
porting sea-serpents for hundreds of years yet no one has yet produced a
photograph.

It would be interesting to tabulate the responses to see how reliable
were the reports on the Japanese balloons during the war. There too had a
phenomenon proven to be real.

It is interesting that the reports evitably reach a maximum frequency
during the end of June 1947 and then slowly taper off. We can assume that
this is actually an indication of how much activity was actually about, or,
quite differently, we can take this frequency curve as indicating something
about mass psychology.

This point can be tested. Suppose the population is momentarily ex-
cited; how does the frequency of reports vary with time? A study of
crank letters received after the recent publicity given to the satellite
reports should give the required frequency distribution.

It is probably unnecessary but certainly not sufficient that the un-
identified object curve and the crank-letter curve should be similar in
order for the flying disks to be classified as hallucinations.

A large scale experiment was made at the time of Orson Welle's
"Martian" broadcast. Some records of this must persist in newspaper
files.

CLASSIFICATION II. MAN-MADE TERRESTRIAL PHENOMENA.
1) The objects may be Russian aircraft. If this were so, then the cor-
siderations of Sections a and B indicate that we would have plenty to
worry about. It is the author's opinion that only an accidental discovery

or a device or thought wave before achieving such sufficing to explain such devices. It is doubtful whether a potential enemy would arouse our curiosity in such idle fashions.

CLASSIFICATION OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL OBJECTS.

1) Meteors: It is noteworthy that the British physicist Lovell writing "Physics Today" mentions the rapid discovery of new daytime meteorologs which followed the maneuvers during 1947. The reported objects lose little of their interest however if they are of meteoritic origin.

2) Animals: although the objects as described seem less animal than anything else, there are few reliable reports on extraterrestrial animals.

3) Space Ships. The following considerations pertain:

a) If there is an extra terre trial civilization which has made such objects as reported or it is most probably that its development is far in advance of ours. This argument on by a most orderly probability arguments sans without recourse of astronomical hypotheses.

b) Such civilization might observe us on earth we may have atomic bombs and even fast developing rockets. In view of the past history of mankind they should be alarmed. We should therefore expect at this time above all to behold such visitations.

Since the acts of mankind most easily observed from a distance are A-bomb explosions we should expect some relation to obtain between the time of A-bomb explosion, the times at which the space ships are seen, and the time required for such ship to arrive from and return to home-base.

PART III. RECOMMENDATIONS.

1) The file should be continued.

2) A meteorologist should compute the approximate error required to

evaporate as much cloud as shown in the incident 26 photographs. Together with an aerodynamicist he should examine whether a meteorite of unusual shape could move as observed.

3) The calculations suggested in Part II, Section A, should be estimated by an aerodynamisist with such changes as his more detailed knowledge may suggest.

4) The mass-psychology studies outlined in Part II, Section C, Clausulation 3 should be carried out by a competent staff of statisticians and mass-psychologists.

5) Interviewing agents should carry objects or moving pictures for comparison with reporter's memories. These devices should be properly designed by a psychologist experienced in problems pertaining to aircraft and design of aircraft control equipment so that he shall have some grasp of what it is that is to be found out. If the Air Force has reason to be seriously interested in these reports it should take immediate steps to interrogate the reporters more prosicely.

6) A person skilled in the optics of the eye and of the atmosphere should investigate the particular point that several reports agree in describing the objects as being about ten times as wide as they are thick; the point being to see if there is a plurality of actual shapes which appear so under conditions approaching limiting resolution or detectable contrast.

Dear Colonel Tarmstroth,

In reply to your inquiry of March 24th, we had not planned to 
issue a formal report on project "sign" until or unless our 
study leads to some unusual or unexpected finding which would
throw new light on "flying saucers".

We are now working, though, to have a search of significant
correlations or other indirect pieces of evidence. It is 
expected that we shall have explored all our various avenues
of attack in about two months. To date we have found nothing
which would seriously contravert simple rational explanations
of the various phenomena in terms of balloons, conventional
aircraft, planets, meteors, bits of A.F. special illusions, 
practical jokers, psychophysiological reports, and the like.

We should like to take this opportunity to raise a few questions:
(1) Has it been decided just how this is a phenomenon, (2) apparently
unknown file to agencies. Is so what are the characteristic
or incidents like was continued from the date; why? (3) Has A.M.C
heard from a reliable source of an incident in which fisherman
observed flying objects which dropped material which slay
collected and subsequently given to official investigators. The
investigators' plane crashed but there was a survivor. We do not
seem to have a file or this incident - certainly not a complete
file. May we have one?

Sincerely yours,

Brigadier General Putt
United States Air Force
Director of Research and Development
Officer, Deputy Chief of Staff, Materiel
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear General Putt:

Please refer to your letter of 18 November 1943 relative to the "Flying object" problem and Mr. Collbohm's reply dated 24 November 1943. In paragraph (b) of the reply, Mr. Collbohm promises (among other things) to send a discussion of the "special design and performance characteristics that are believed to distinguish space ships."

This present letter gives, in very general terms, a description of the likelihood of a visit from other worlds as an engineering problem and some points regarding the use of space vehicles as compared with descriptions of Flying objects, i.e., Collbohm will deliver copies to Colonel McCoy at Wright-Patterson Air Base during the RAND briefing there within the next few days.

A good beginning: Is it discuss some possible physics of origin of "visiting space ships. Astronomers largely in agreement that only one member of the Solar System (besides Earth) can support higher forms of life, it is the planet Mars. Even Mars appears quite desolate and inhospitable so that a race would be more occupied with survival than we are on Earth. Reference 1 gives equivalent descriptions of conditions on the various planets and a simulated, A motor contact from. For 1 (p. 229) same will be included here.

Whether intelligent beings exist to appreciate these splendors of the Martian landscape is pure speculation. If we have correctly reconstructed the history of Mars, there is little reason to believe that the life processes may not have followed a course similar to terrestrial evolution. With this assumption, three general possibilities emerge. Intelligent beings may have protected themselves against the exigessively slow loss of atmosphere, oxygen and water, by constructing homes and cities with the physical conditions scientifically con-

There is a photograph at the top left of the document page. It appears to be a small, dark object with a lighter background. The object is too small and distant to discern its details, and the background too blurry to recognize any features. It may be a photograph relevant to the UFO report, but nothing specific can be stated from this image alone.

trolled. As a second possibilitv, evolution may have
developed a being who can withstand the rigors of the
Martian climate. Or the race may have perished.

These possibilities have been sufficiently expounded in
the pseudo-scientific literature to make further amplifi-
cator superfluous. However, there may exist some Interest-
ing restructions to the anatomy and physiology of a Martian.
First of all, to escape from their lighter pull one has
pletely altered respiratory system for warm-blooded creatures,
if the atmosphere's pressure is much below the vapor pressure
of waten at the body temperature of the individual then process
of breathing with our type of lungs becomes impossible. On
Mars the critical pressure for a body temperature of 98.6° F.
occurs when a column of the atmosphere contains one sixth the
mass of a terrestrial column or Mars the critical body temp.
of 770°, the critical mass ratio is reduced to about one
twelfth, and at 50° F. to about 0.19 twenty-fourth. If the
critical values are of the same order as the values estimated
for the Martian atmosphere. Accordingly, the anatomy and phys-
iology of a Martian may be radically different from ours but
this is all conjecture.

We do not know the origin of life, even on the Earth. We
are unable to observe any signs of intelligent life on Mars.
The reason may form a continuation. If the believes that the
life force is universal and that only intelligence brings may he
once developed on Mars, he hesitates to imagine that they he
ages tested for countless generations for a rate atmosphere which
is nearly devoid of oxygen and water, and on a planet where
the nights are much colder than our arctic winters. The ex-
istence of intelligent life on Mars is not impossible but it is
completely unproven.

It is not too unreasonable to a step further and consider Venus
as a possible home for intelligent life. The atmosphere, to be sure,
apparently consists mostly of carbon dioxide with deep clouds of
methadeye droplets, still there seems to be little or no water.
Yet ultraviolet organisms might develop in chemical environments that
are strange to us: the vegetable kingdom, for example, operates
on a fundamentally different energy cycle from Man. Bodies might
be constructed by a force with a different chemistry. In other
physical principles than any of the creatures we know. One thing
is evident: fishes, insects,cni mammals all manufacture within
their own bodies complex chemical compounds that do not exist as
minerals. To this extent, life is self-sufficient and might well
adapt itself to any environment with certain limits of temperature
(and size of creature).

Venus has two handicaps relatWe to Mars. Her mass, and gravity,
are nearly as large as for the Earth (Mars is smaller) and her

clouds, stratosphere would obscure a stationary, if some space
travel. Their arrival Sol:ar system would pose problems
that they over be ignored.

In the next few paragraphs, we speak of Mars. It should
be unmentioned t at must of the remarks apply equally well to
Venus.

Various people have suggested that a diamond race may have
been visiting Earth of at Mars or Venus y intervals from ideal
to caves. Representations, 'hings of the sky therefore have been handed
down through generations. If this yup time, a sage of such
knowledge and power would have established some form of direct
contact. They could go sight Earth's inhabitants would be hap-
less to do intentionally harm. If afraid or carrying diseases
home, they would at least try to communicate to ideal here,
by all at any such lest attempt to signals. It is hard to
count its ability for mysterious rays and then simply go away,
flight is writer, for him ranged space travel peculiar
advanced engineers and so my fiction, and is we to thinking.
It is not classifiable as science terms do) m other space
ships with two sides. Furthermore, a would which had mucu-
ficulty to exercise on the planet, as Mars or Venus, send itself to follow more. A even more would laughably.

One other hypothesis needs be discussed. It is that the
Martians a kept a long-term routine watch Earth and have
been alarmed by the which our as stars as earlier that
is an invited and the threshold space travel. Venus
is or similar here because the cold climate atmosphere were
such a survey impossible. race flying objects old make
sight in the Spring of 1947, after a total 5 atomic bomb ex-
plosions, I.e., Almondo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Crossroads A
ni Crossroads B, or those, the first two were its posters of
an green crossings, the third was red doubtful (at the time to
the of its radioactivity) any the last two were on the wrong
target so Earth. It is likely that years astronomers, with
other atmosphere, could build telescopes simply enough to see
a-bombs explosions Earth, even though were 156 and 153
million miles away, respectively, on the Almondo and Hiro-
shima dates. The weakest point the hypothesis that a
continual, defensive stash or Earth by per year, is one the
tremendous tensile strength would collisions. We
that a remarkably assembled Man would undertake it, we
haven't even considered the idea Venus or Mars, for example.

The substance of this discussion is that if Martians
are now visiting us without contact, it can be assumed that
they have just recently succeeded in space travel and
their civilization would be practically abreast ours.

Here is the extracted text from the document:

```
The chance that Martians, under such widely divergent condi-
tions, would have a civilization resembling our own is ex-
tremely remote. It is particularly unlikely that their
civilization would lag within a half century of our own state
of advancement. Yet in the last 50 years we have just started
to use aircraft and in the next 50 years we will almost
certainly start exploring space.

Thus it appears that space travel from another point within
the Solar system is possible but very unlikely. Odds are at
least a thousand-to-one against it.

This leaves the totality of planets of other stars in the
Galaxy as possible sources. Any modern astronomers believe
that planets are fairly normal and logical affairs in the life
history of a star (rather than an astlysinda odditie) so that
many planets can be expected to exist in space.

To narrow the field a little, some loose speculations can
be written for the star about which the home planet would
revolve. Let us say that the star should bear a family re-
semblance to the Sun, which is a member of the so-called “main
sequence” of stars, i.e., we eliminate white dwarfs, red giants
and supergiants. For a description of these types, see refer-
ence 2, chapter 5, for there is no space here even for making this
assumption except to simplify discussion; we are still consider-
ing the majority of stars.

Next, true variable stars can be eliminated, since conditions on
a planet attached to a variable star would fluctuate too wildly
to permit life. The number of stars deleted here is n.ticibly
small. Reference 3, pages 76 and 63 indicate that the most
common types are too bright to be in early steps in the Hert.
Lastly, we shall not carry our multiple stars, since the condi-
tions for stable planet orbits are obscure in such cases. About
a third of the stars are eliminated by this restriction.

As our best known sample of space we can take a volume with the
Sun at the center and a radius of 16 light years. A compilation
of the 17 known stars, including the Sun, within this volume is
given in reference 1, pages 32 to 57. Eliminating according to
the above discussion, two are white dwarfs, eight are ones to
account for 16 stars and two trinaries account for 6 more. The
remainder, 22 stars, can be considered as eligible for habitable 
planets.
```

- page 261 -

There are no photographs present on the page.

Here is the text from the document:

---
Assuming the above volume to be typical, the contents of any other reasonable volume can be found by varying the number of stars appropriately with the volume, or with the radius used, S = 2 x  = 16, where S is number of eligible stars : is the radius or the volume in light years. (This Formula should only be used for radii greater than 15 light years. For smaller samples we call for a recount. For example, only one known eligible star other than the Sun lies within eight light years.)

Having an estimate of the number of usable stars, it is now necessary to make a guess as to the number of habitable planets. ie have only one observed sample, the Solar System, and the Fuss must be made with low "confidence, since intelligent life may not be randomly distributed at all.

The Sun has nine planets, arranged in a fairly regular progression of orbits (see reference 1, Appendix I). It then lends credence to theories that many stars have planets or at one nine planets, (one, the Earth) completely suitable for life. Tho majority (an adjustment orbits are near 5: masses! Mars has extremely vigorous livin- conditions, and Venus has an unsuitable atmosphere. Plowed very broadly indeed, that could mean that each star would have carries of planets so spaced that one, or possibly two, would have correct temperatures, correct moisture content and a troposphere to support civilized life. Let us assume that there is, on the average, one habitable planet per eligible star.

There is no line of reasoning or evidence which can indicate whether life will actually develop on a planet where the conditions are suitable. Here again, the Earth may be unique rather than a random samples. This writer can only inject some personal intuition into the discussion with the view that life is not unique on earth, or given the random result of a low probability, but the practically inevitable in the right conditions. This is to say, the number of inhabited planets is equal to those that are suitable!

One more item needs to be considered, Knowing nothing at all about other races, we must assume that Man is average as to technical advancement, environmental difficulties, etc. That is, one half of the other planets are behind us and have no space travel and the other half are ahead and have various levels of space travel. We can thus imagine that in our sample volume there are 111 races of beings who have begun space explorations. The formula on page 3 above now becomes

R = 11 x (  )
where R is the number of races exploring space in a spherical volume of radius  = 16 light years.

Arguments like those applied to Martians on page 2 need not apply to races from other star systems. Instead of being first not to call, Earth would possibly be reached only after many centuries of development and exploration with space ships, so that a visiting race would be expected to be far in advance of Man.

The document does not contain any photographs. It is a text-based page from a report, which appears to be discussing the theoretical aspects of space travel related to Mars and Earth. Here is the transcription of the text in the document:

```plaintext
To summarize the discussion thus far: the chan.e of spaoe
travelers existinc at olants attached to nelghborinc stars is very
much creater than the chante of space-travelinr Martian". The
one can be viewed almost as a certainty (if the assumptions are
accepted), whereas the other is very slight indeed.

In osder to estimate to relative chan.es that visitors from
Mars or star x could come to the Earth and act like "flyinc ohiects",
some discussion of characteristics of spaoe ships is necessary.

To handle the simple case first, a trip from Mars to Earth
should be feasible using a rocket-powered vehicle. One here, the
rocket would probably use more fuel in slowinc down for a landing
than it did in initial takeoff, due to Earth's higher gravitational
force.

A rough estimate of one-way performance can by found by adding
the so-called "escape velocity" of Mars to that of the Earth olus
the total energy chante (kinetic and potential) used in, transferring
from one planetary orbit to the other. These are 3.1, 7.9, and 7.0
miles per second, respectively, givinc a total required performance
of 20.0 miled per second for a one-way flight. Barring a refueling
mission, the vehicle would have to land and replenish or else carry
100% reserves for the trip home.

Let us assume the Martians have developed a nuclear, hydro-
propelled vehicle (the most efficient basic arrancement that has
been conceived here on Earth) which uses half its stages to get here
and the remainincr states to return to Mars, thus completes a round
trip without refueling but slowinc down enough in our atmosphere
to be easily visible (i.e., practically markir a landinc). Since it
is nuclear powered, gas temperatures will be limited to the maximum
operating temperatures, the materials can withstand (heat must transfer
from the pile to the gas so coolinc can't be used in the pile).
The lightest minting point material on/which we can find
uranium carbide. It has a melting point of 4050oR. Assume the Martians
are capable of realizing a gas temperature of 4500oR (= 2500oK), and
that they also have alloys which make himh motor pressures (3000
psi) eoonomical. Then the specific Impulse will be I = 1035 seconds
and the exhaust velocity will be I * g = 33,400 ft/sec (reference 5).
Calculations show that using a single state for each leg of the journey
would reauire a fuel/qross weight ratio or,96 (for each state)
too hiph to be practical. Using two states each way (four altoqether)
brings the requred fuel ratio down to .91, a value that can be
realized.

If, by the development of strong alloys, the basic weight could
be kept to 10% of the total weicht for each stage, a resulted of 9%
could be used for payload. A four stage vehicle would then have a
gross weicht (100%) 15,000 times as great as the payload: thus,
if the payload were 2,000 pounds, the cross weight would be 30 million
pounds at initial takeoff (Earth pounds).

Of course, if we allow the Martians to refiol, the vehicle
could have only two stafes* and the gross wei^t would be only
(10^2)* times the payload, i.e., 250,000 pounds. This would
require bruntinf; electrolytics and refrigerating equipment and
sirma at the South Pole lon¿ enouph to extract fuel for the journey h^re,
since they have not asked us for supplies. Our oceans (electrolysis
to make R^) would be obvious to Martion telescopes and they might
conceiv^iislv follow such a plan, particularly if they came harp without
foreknowledge tVitt Earth has a civilization.

Requirements for a trip from a planet attached to some star
other than the Sun can be calculated in a similar manner. Here the
enerpy (or velocity) required has more parts: (a) escape from the
planet (b) escape from the star (c) enough velocity to traverse a
few light years of space in reasonable time (d) deceleration toward
the Sun (e) deceleratoon toward the Earth. The nearest "eligible"
star is an object called Wolf 359 (barnes name), 4°2t9 L*, at a
distance of 8.0 light years. It is small, havinq an absolute maq-
nitude of 16.6 and its typical of "red dwarfs" which make up more
than half of the eli»ible populations. By comparison with similar
stars of known mass, this star is estimated to have a mass ?nly
1/03 as great as the sun. since the sun starts has a low luminosity (being
much cooler and smaller than the Sun) a habitable planet would need
to be in a small orbit for warmth.

Of the chan^es of energy required as listed ln the preceeding
paragraph, item (c), velocity to traverse intervening space, is so
large as to make the others compatible nealible. If the visitors
were long lived and could "hibernate" for 30 years both coming and
going, then velocity of speed of 1%'' would be required, i.e., the
enormous 'V of the 19, 29, or 39 that some theories imple
beyond the reach of any predicted level of rocket propulsion.

If a race were far enough advanced to make really efficient use
of nuclear energy, then a 1% pa^'t of the mass of the nuclear ma-
terial might be converted into jet energy, We have no idea how
to do this, in fact perfacet??, Jet.id.ees that the attaljas required
to withstand the temperatures encountered by tne extremely h^to-
able. Let us start from a Je_t propelled inte^-mass-weiqht ratio of
75. If the total amount of expendable material (nuclear plus prooell-
ent) can be .85 of the gross weii^ht, then the nuclear material expended
can be .10 of the gross. Using an effclency of .5 for converting
nuclear energy to jet enrez and neglectinq rolstiviitic mass cor-
rections, then a rocket velocity of half the velocity of 1:ht would
be attained. This would mean a tran^stime of 16 years each way from
the star Wolf 359, or longer times from other eligible stars. To try
to go much faster would mean spendinq much energ;r on relativistic change
in mass and therefore opera-ing at lowered efflcency.

* Actually three stages. On the trip to Earth, the first sta"e would
be filled with fuel, the second sta:^' would contain partial fuel, the
third would be empty. The first sta^ge would be thrown away during
flight. On the trip back to Mars, the second and third stages would he
filled with fuel. The gross wei^ht of the Initial vehicle would be of
the order of magnitude of a two-stage rockQt.

To summarize this section of the discussion, it can be said
that a trip from Mars is a logical enterprise for another over our own
present technological status, but that a trip from a starry system
requires improvements of propulsion that we have not yet conceived.

Combining the efforts of all the science-fiction writers, we
could conjure up a large number of hypothetical methods of transport-
ation like gravity shields, space warps, teleporta, stimulators,
enzym homs and so on. Conceivably, gravity shields might act as solar
sayers in the Galaxy, once we manage to discover the 'reverse' throttle of
travel that would be fantastic by our standards. Yet the larger the
volume of space that must be included in order to strengthen this
possibility, the lower will be the chance that the race involved
would ever find the earth. The Galaxy has three hundred billion
100,000 light years and a total mass about two hundred of fifty times
that of the Sun (see reference 4), Object 51 is a giant spiral, roughly
and estimated in numbers of several hundred billion (reference 5),
p. 4) at distances up to billions of light years (see Fen 7, p. 2, 18a).
The number of stars in the known universe is enormous, yet so are the
distances involved. A super-race (unless they occupy relatively would
not be likely to stumble upon Planet III of Sol, a fifth-magnitude
star in the rarefied outskirts of the Galaxy.

A description of the probable operating characteristics of space
ships must be based on the assumption that they will be rockets,
since this is the only form of propulsion that we know will function
in outer space. Below are listed a few of the significant factors of
rocketry in relation to the "flying objects".

(a) Maneuverability. A special-purpose rocket can be made as
maneuverable as we like, with very high accelerations either along
or normal to the flight path. However, such a hyperformance space ship
will certainly be large and unwieldy and could hardly be designed to
maneuver favorably year round in the Earth's atmosphere. The only
economical maneuver would be to come down and go up more or less ver-
tically.

(b) Fuel reserves. It is hard to see how a single rocket ship
could carry enough extra fuel to make repeated descents into the
Earth's atmosphere. The large number of flying objects reported in
quick succession could only mean a large number of visiting craft.

Two possibilities thus are presented. First, a number of space
ships could have come as a group. This would only be done if full-
dress contact were to be established. Second, numerous small craft
might descend from a mother ship which coasts around the Earth in
a satellite orbit. But this could mean that the smaller craft would
have to be rockets of substantial performance, and to concerns them the
mother ship would have to be truly enormous.

(c) Appearance. A vertically descending rocket might well
appear as a luminous disk to a person directly below. Observers at
a distance, however, would surely identify the rocket for what it
really is. There would probably be no reports or oblique views
than of end-on views; of course, the "shape reports" not typical of
our rockets; yet the exhaust should be easy to see.

One or two additional general remarks may be relevant to space-
ships as "flying objects". The distribution of "flying objects" is
peculiar, to say the least. As far as this writer knows, all inci-
dents have occurred within the United States, whereas very similar
events could be expected to scatter their visits more strongly over
over the globe. The small area covered indicates strongly that the
flying objects are of Earthly origin, whether physical or psychological.

The lack of purpose apparent in the various episodes is also
puzzling. Only one motive can be assigned; that the spacemen, if so
they must have been satisfied long ago that we can't catch them.
It seems fruitless for them to keep repeating the same experiment.

Conclusions:

Although visits from outer space are believed to be possible,
they are believed to be very improbable. In particular, the actions
attributed to the "flying objects" reported during 1947 and 1948
seem inconsistent with the requirements for space travel.

COLLATERAL STUDIES

In relation to the investigation, besides the individual
analyses of separate incidents, two brief studies were conducted.

Certain breakdowns of the subject reports were made, for
the purpose of determining whether they include any prevalent
characteristics; for example, incidents were grouped according to
the date of occurrence, the hour, the presence or lack of noise,
presence or lack of trail or exhaust, number of observers, general
qualifications of observers (whether with appropriate training for
accurate observation of aerial phenomena -- aviators, weather ob-
servers, etc., or laymen). Although these classifications were
helpful in spotting identical or similar incidents, they revealed
no pertinent trends.

As a matter of general interest, the highly dubious works
of Charles Fort (which, as has been stated in a previous report,
are entirely reprehensible in viewpoint, but which do contain ac-
counts of unusual aerial sightings over a period of many years)
were examined, to check whether any of the reasonably authenticated
incidents are similar to those recent reports. It was found, how-
ever, that Mr. Fort's accounts do not include sufficient specific
evidence to reveal positive similarities, and the most that can be
said of the works is that they indicate that strange objects in the
sky have been reported long before this post-World War II flurry.

SUBJECT: Analysis of Project "Grudge" Reported Incidents

TO: Commanding General
      Air Material Command
      Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
      Dayton, Ohio
      ATTN: MCIAO

1. Reference is made to the letters from your Headquarters to 
this station of 22 November 1948, 6 December 1948, and 14 January 1949,
Subject: "Project Sign", requesting that reported incidents I
through IV be analyzed to determine whether or not these might have
been caused by balloons launched by these laboratories.

2. A listing has been compiled of all balloons launched by these
laboratories and its contractors for special atmospheric research pur-
poses, from the first such launching to No. 101 on 17 November 1948.
Each of these launchings has been compared with the reported incidents
1 through IV. Factors of comparison were date of launching and date
of recovery with respect to date of reported incidents; place of launch-
ing and place of recovery with respect to the place of reported inci-
dent; and possible deviations from the known flight path with respect
 to the place of reported incident. So that your office may make an
independent analysis, three copies of the launching list are inclosed.

Incidents No. 5 through No. 16 reported on 4 July 1947 
throughout Oregon, Idaho and Washington gave, in general, descriptions
of clusters or groups of objects. The 3 July 1947 balloon launching
No. 8 at Alamogordo was a cluster of balloons and was not recovered,
and so might be suspected of being the cause of these reports. However,
although not recovered, this flight was terminated in the New Mexico
Tularosa Valley only a few miles northwest of Alamogordo. That the
balloons were downed was determined both by airplane spotting and by
radio direction finding upon the balloon cluster's instruments.
Recovery of the balloons and instruments was prevented by the im-
passibility of the terrain.

b. Balloon release No. 11 of 7 July 1947 could compare
with respect to date with Incident No. 1 through No. 4, and again
with Incident No. 10. This balloon flight was again a cluster.

The description of incident No. 10 is inconsistent with the appearance of balloon flight No. III. Also, in consideration of the prevailing upper winds, it is very unlikely that the balloon would have gone more than a few miles westward of Alamogordo, although it was admitted that a long flight west of the launching point could not be ruled out as impossible.

c. Incident No. 17 compares somewhat in time with balloon launch No. 10 of 5 July 1947. However, balloon No. 10 although not recovered was known to have been downed northeast of Alamogordo, New Mexico. It was not recovered due to impassibility of terrain. Incident No. 113 is a reasonable description of the 20 ft. plastic balloon and instruments used by these laboratories. This incident was on the date of balloon release No. 146 of 9 April 1948 at Alamogordo. However, the time of the reported incident (1500 CST) is about 1/2 hour before the time of balloon release (1432 MST), thus the incident could not have been that balloon.

d. It is of interest to note that incident No. 122 was reported by an employee of these laboratories who had considerable experience in the use of balloons of all kinds, and could have been depended upon to know the appearance and behavior of a balloon if it was this he saw.

e. Incident No. 163 bears a fair description of the appearance of a large plastic balloon in sunset light. The object's disappearance could be accounted for either by its movement into the earth's sunset shadow or by natural defocusing of the observer's eyes. This incident could possibly have been balloon No. 75 or 76 on 26 or 21 and 22 July 1948 from Alamogordo. Balloon No. 75 was recovered at Hollister, California, which is in the Monterey Bay area, on 22 July 1948 and could have easily had a trajectory which would have been within sight of the Los Angeles area. Balloon No. 76 was never recovered. It is possible that it had a trajectory similar to No. 75.

f. All other reported incidents from 1 to 172 do not seem to have reasonable comparison with balloons launched by these Laboratories.

3. The balloons used by these Laboratories are now somewhat standardized. They are 20 feet long, plastic, white in color, and hemispherical-dome in shape. Nearly all launching are made at the Holloman AFB or Alamogordo, New Mexico. Two photographs are enclosed showing the appearance and size of these balloons. The larger photograph shows the typical flight appearance at any attitudes where it would be visible. It is hoped that this information may be of some use to you in identifying future reports of incidents.

4. It is believed that certain of the items in the "Questionnaire-Checklist - Identified Flying Objects" produce insignificant and unreliable data from an observer. These are: 9. Distance of object from observer; 11. Altitude; 12. Speed; and 16. Size. For any unfamiliar object beyond the focal range of the human eyes (about 60 ft.), these four factors are mutually inter-dependent and therefore indeterminant unless at least one of them (and some observed angles) are known. Directly asking an observer about these indeterminants not only gets unreliable data but introduces wild answers because the observer is led into making a statement about quantities for which he has no basis in fact. He will unconsciously assume knowledge of some one of these factors and so give incorrect information on all. That people (many of whom should know better) will arbitrarily give answers to two significant figures on these questions, which really cannot be answered at all, is proof of the unreliability of their information.

5. It is suggested that these four items on the questionnaire be replaced by questions which will yield answers as possible of being independent facts in terms of the observer's best estimates of angles and time. From such data given by observers of the same object at two different places, a reliable calculated estimate could be made of the object's size, altitude, speed and path. These data should include:

a. An estimate of the angular size of the object. A quick but reasonable estimate tar us ue by comparing the angle subtended by the index finger held at arms length. The finger (7/8" wide) of an average man held at 26" to 30" (arms length) will subtend an angle of approximately two degrees. In this way angular size from about 1/2° to about 60° can be estimated.

b. The range of the object's flight in terms of the angle subtended by the observed path. If the object moves ir. i reasonably straight course it is important to observe the position at the beginning and the end of its course. After the flight has been completed a person can extend his arms toward the two points and also at 90° or 180° and by comparison estimate the angular extent of the flight. It is also important that information which will determine those directions relative to points on the horizon, which will tell where the UFO is located with objects on the point being viewed, the azimuth suir (if the time of day is also noted) or by the north star, the orientation can be rechecked at any later time.

c. The time required for the object to traverse the observed course. This is probably the most difficult estimate to make. Timing with a watch is the most satisfactory, but an observer is so seldom prepared to do so. Seconds can be counted with good accuracy by saying,

"One flying saucer, two flying saucers, three flying saucers" --etc.. At normal speaking speed. On the other hand it is not easy to count seconds and at the same time make all the other desirable observations. It must be remembered that when a person is excited his estimates of time are apt to be rather inaccurate.

d. Estimating of the elevation angle of the object. Almost all persons WILL overestimate elevation angles. This tendency can be reduced by the observer extending one arm vertically and the other horizontally to observe a 90° angle. The vertical arm can then be lowered to point to the observed object -- in this way the observed angle can be compared with a 90° angle and a more accurate estimate obtained.

6. It is realised that it might not be possible for an observer to perform the operations suggested in the preceding paragraph during the period the object is sighted. If he would immediately reconsider what he saw and then estimate such measurements, he should be able to give quantitative answers accurate to at least 25°. In interrogations observers, they should also be asked to recount structural observations and then estimate these and so forth. It is suggested that instructions for making such quick estimated observations be given to weather observers, control tower operators, civil police, forest and fire rangers, and other such people who might have good chances of seeing unidentified flying objects. If any information concerning unidentified flying objects is given to the public, instructions for reliable observation should be included.

7. This organization will be pleased to be of any further assistance required in connection with this matter.

SUBJECT:    Psychological Analysis of Reports of Unidentified
                   Aerial Objects

SECTION:     Aero Medical Laboratory

SERIAL NO.: MXCRO-69p-150                                           Expenditure Order No. 69p-38

A. PURPOSE:
    1. At the request of the Technical Intelligence Division, Intelligence
Department, AMC, an analysis has been made, from a psychological point of 
view, of 212 investigations of persons reporting sightings of unidentified
aerial objects.

B. FACTUAL DATA:
    2. A report of this analysis is attached as Appendix A.

C. CONCLUSION:
    3. It is concluded by the writer that there are sufficient psychological
explanations for the reports of unidentified flying objects to provide
plausible explanations for reports not otherwise explainable. These errors
in identifying real stimuli result chiefly from inability to estimate
speed, distance and size.

D. RECOMMENDATIONS:
    4. Test the ability of pilots to estimate the course of a small 
lighted balloon while doing acrobatics with it at night. It is suggested
that several pilots try to fly pursuant curves and collision courses on 
such targets at night and report accurately their sensations. It would be 
desirable, but probably impossible, to keep them from knowing the nature
of the light source.

    5. In all future reports of unidentified objects specify the location
of object with reference to polar coordinates (direction and degrees above
the horizon) rather than asking individuals to estimate distance. If
possible, obtain an estimate of size in terms of the visual angle sub-
tended by the object.

    6. In all future investigations determine the angular position
of the sun with respect to the unidentified object and the observer.

PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF REPORTS OF

UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS

The Inaccuracy of Human Observation

Psychologists have long know that human perception is fallible.
In fact, part of the science of psychology is concerned with the
measurement of errors of observation, and with the discovery of the
conditions and laws that govern such phenomena.

Errors of observation may be classified as variable or constant.
Variable errors are those in which a number of separate observations
are found to differ from one another. The distribution of such
errors often follows the normal probability curve. Constant errors
are those in which observations are consistently biased in one or
another direction. For example, individuals often are guilty of a
constant error, in the direction of underestimation, in reporting
their ages.

Errors of observation may be classified further as precision errors
and identification errors. Inaccuracy in estimating the speed of an
aircraft is an example of the former. Mistaking an aircraft for a
"flying saucer" is an example of the latter.

It is the purpose of the present report to analyze 212 reports of
observations of unidentified flying objects in order to see to what
extent these reports can be explained in terms of known psychological
facts and principles.

These conditions are largely lacking in the case of the data available
on unidentified flying objects. It is impossible to say with any
assurance what any particular individual in this series of 212 reports
was actually observing at any particular time. It is only possible
to examine the accumulation of available evidence or the accumulation
of all reports of a given class (i.e., all reports from supposedly
competent observers) and to consider them in a statistical sense. If
certain characteristics appear repeatedly in reports from different
people it may be possible to infer causal factors.

It will never be possible, on the other hand, to say with certainty
that any given observer could not have seen a space ship or an enemy
missile, or some other object. It will only be possible to estimate
the probability that he could have seen such things.

The principal hypotheses to be examined in the following discussion
is that reports of unidentified flying objects have the characteristics 
that would be expected if they were cases of failure, on the part of 
typical normal individuals, to identify common or familiar phenomena.
Possible Sources of Inaccurate Reports of Flying Objects

There are three broad classes of mistakes in human observations.
These are the following: 1. Misinterpreting the nature of real stimuli,
2. Mistaking unreal (imaginary) stimuli for real ones, and 3. Deliberate
misinformation. Each of these are considered briefly below.

(1) Errors in Identifying Real Stimuli. All normal,
intelligence people experience certain errors of observation. The
moon appears much larger on the horizon than when it is high in the
sky. A stick looks bent when one end is in water. Distant objects
appear relatively close in clear, desert atmosphere. A small point-
source of light, if viewed in a dark room, will appear to move about in 
a certain irregularity when there are no visual clues to its dist-

Visual stimuli originating within the eye itself also give rise
to mistaken observations. Muscae volitantes or "flying gnats" are small
solid particles that float about in the fluids of the eye and cast
shadows on the retina. They often can be seen when you look up at
the clear sky, or when you are reading. They move as your eyes move.
It is sometimes possible also to see corpuscles or other objects that
are circulating within the fluids in the retina of the eye.

Then, of course, everyone from time to time mistakes some more
or less familiar object for another object. A probable explanation
for many reports of unidentified aerial phenomena is that the object
is really something quite familiar, such as an aircraft, a light, or a
bird. The observer simply fails to identify it correctly. These
errors arise chiefly as a result of inability to estimate speed and
distance.

(2) Mistaking Imaginary for Real Events. This error of
observation is usually made only by children, by individuals of low
intelligence (people who are very suggestible), by people who see
visions, or by the mentally ill. It usually is not difficult for an

RECOMMENDATIONS

This investigator would like to offer three recommendations,
one in the general interest of the nation's airmen, and two as aids
toward more effective investigation of the problem of unidentified
aerial objects, if such work is continued.

First and foremost, it is definitely recommended that Air
Forces personnel be apprised of simple astronomical phenomena like
the recurrent brilliance of Venus and the characteristics of a typi-
cal fireball, so that much confusion and alarm and even possible tragic
consequences can be avoided. If, as seems possible, Lieutenant Mantell
met his death while attempting to chase down Venus, certainly the need
for such basic education is great.

Second, if Project GRUDGE is authorized to extend its inves-
tigations, it might be found profitable to interrogate personally
varied trained personnel concerning any untoward aerial objects which
they may have observed in the past. Many competent observers might
hesitate to take the initiative in reporting such phenomena for fear
of ridicule or criticism, yet it is only from such people that ac-
curate and meaningful descriptions can be obtained; reliance on
the general public for such observations is almost certain to prove of
little value. It would be of considerable aid to know whether (aside
from the few cases reported here) experienced pilots, weather observers,
and other "watchers of the sky" have ever found unidentified objects
there. Even negative results would prove valuable, for they would
offer evidence for the belief held by many that the unexplained

exposure to spot this type of person. Reports will be received by such
persons especially at times when the radio and newspapers carry accounts
of strange phenomena. Relatively few of the 212 investigations con-
sidered in this report are of this nature, probably because investigators
interviewed only the more reliable type of witness.

(3) Deliberate Falsifications. It is always possible that
some persons will give false reports. Circulation of false reports
has been a standard psychological warfare technique from earliest times.
This procedure might have some utility in wartime, but it hardly seems
likely that it would be resorted to at this time. Probably, however,
some individuals start false reports of "Flying saucers" for the same
reason that they turn in false fire alarms.

Some Consistent Points in the R.eports of Unidentified Objects.

The following section summarizes some significant facts that come
out of a tabulation of 212 reports of interrogations, by USAF Intelligence
Officer, of some of the individuals who reported seeing unidentified
flying objects. It is understood that these interrogations covered
primarily persons that were judged to be reliable. Most of the 212
reports were made by pilots, non-flying officers, professional men,
government employees, housewives and other supposedly dependable
people.

1. Number of objects. About 75% of the people who reported
on the number of objects seen said that they saw only one object.

2. Time the object remained in sight. About half of the persons
specifying time in sight saw the object for 60 seconds or less.

3. Altitude and distance of the object. Of those who estimated
the distance of the object, two-thirds judged it to be more than a mile
away. Ninety percent also thought that it was more than 1,000 feet high.

4. Speed. About half judged that the speed was less than 500
miles an hour. The other half of the judgments varied from 500 miles
an hour all the way to "terrific", "tremendous", "inconceivable" and
"blue blazes".

5. Background against which viewed. The great majority of
observers saw the object against a clear day or night sky.

6. Time of day sighted. About two-thirds as many observations
were reported at night as in the day. There are, of course, many more
opportunities for observing things during the day. The most popular
hours were from 12 noon to 5:00 PM; and from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM
at night. Very few (6 only) observations were made from 5:00 to
7:00 PM., the usual hours of sunset.

7. Color. Observers almost universally reported seeing a light-
colored object. Thirty observers reported "white" and twenty-five
said "silver". Over 70 percent described glittering, shiny, liminescent,
flame-like
mirror-like, or other very bright objects. Only six individuals said
black or dark.

8. Shape. Over half described the object as either "round",
"disc-shaped", "spherica" or "circular". Other descriptions were
similar. Very few observers saw any distinctive shape.

9. Size. The majority of observers did not specify the objects'
size. Of those who did over half said it was less than 10 feet in its
largest dimension. Many compared it with a dime, a lamp, a dot, a
weather balloon, a baseball, etc.

Interpretation of the Common Points of All Reports

The words used by observers to describe the appearances of the
unidentified objects fall into a surprisingly uniform pattern. The
objects were usually reported as being far away, small, bright and
without a distinctive shape. They were usually seen against a clear sky
or

and were frequently seen for less than a minute.

First of all, it is obvious that it would usually be impossible for
observers to make reliable estimates of the speed, distance, or size
of such stimulus objects. It is not possible to estimate accurately
the distance of small bright objects viewed against a clear sky,
unless the object is identified first. If you know beforehand that an
object is a weather balloon, an F-80, or a dirigible you can estimate
its speed and distance with some degree of accuracy. In such situations
distance is judged on the basis of known size, and speed on the basis
of an estimate of distance plus the angular change in position. It
must be concluded, therefore, that most of the statements of speed,
distance, altitude and size are entirely unreliable and should be
disregarded. This is doubly true of observations made at night. The
objects seen may actually have been at very great distances, or they
may have been relatively close by. In the latter case, of course, they
could also have been quite small.

Secondly, it is probable that individuals who saw objects in
daylight were in many cases observing either the reflection of the sun
on a shiny surface or else looking directly at a light source of high
intensity. Aircraft themselves, when viewed against a clear sky, are
seen as dark objects against a lighter background unless they are
reflecting the sun's rays directly. This fact was recognised during
the recent war by camouflage experts who placed bright lights on the
leading edges of the wings of aircraft on anti-submarine patrol
in order to conceal them from the eyes of submarining lookouts. If
observers, during daylight hours, were actually seeing lights, or
reflections of the sun, this would account in large measure for their
inability to identify the objects. On the other hand, if they were
actually seeing enemy missiles, for example, the majority of reports

of daylight sightings should have been of dark objects.. It is possible, 
of course, that they may have thought the objects were bright because 
they expected all aerial objects to be bright.

On the basis of the evidence thus far considered, the best guess
as to the nature of a visual stimulus that would elicit reports of
unidentified flying objects is that in the daytime it would be the 
reflection of the sun from an aircraft, a wind-blown object, etc.,
and at night some direct light source, such as an engine exhaust, the 
light on a weather balloon, a running light on an aircraft, a meteor, 
etc., or lights from the ground or the moon reflected back by birds or 
other objects in the air.

Discussion of Several Specific Reports

Discussion of a few specific reports will serve to illustrate some
of the points brought up earlier, particularly some of the factors that
make observations of aerial phenomena inaccurate.

Incidents No. 61 and 162:

In one case (Investigation No. 61) a civilian employee at Fleckam
Field at 0900 observed what looked like a balloon with a bright object
suspended below it. It was estimated to be at about 6,000 ft. The
bright object appeared to reflect the sun's rays at the time. After a
few minutes he looked away and then could not find the object again.

In another case (Inc. 163) a reserve officer at Van Nuys, California,
about an hour before dark saw an object that looked somewhat like a 
weather balloon at about 2000 ft. He kept it is sight for about an 
hour. He later concluded that it was at a great height. At first it
had the color of a fluorescent electric light but became orange as the
sun went down and then rather suddenly became invisible.

Both of these objects could well have been just what they appeared
to resemble most -- balloons. The sum was low in the sky in both cases.
                                                                            UNCLASSIFIED

Reflection of the sun's rays may have given an unusual appearance to the object. The second case illustrates the uncertainty of judgments of height or distance. The object looked near, but when it remained in view for an hour the observer decided that it must be very far away. Actually he probably had nothing on which to base an accurate estimate. [Illegible]

Incidents 61 and 61a.

Two couples saw approximately 12 objects flying in formation: at what they judged to be 2000 or 3000 feet altitude over Logan, Utah at 22:30. They were judged to be about the size of pigeons and looked white. All four observers agreed that these objects looked and acted somewhat like birds but all thought they were not birds because they appeared to travel much faster than birds.

As we have seen, it is not possible to judge speed accurately under the conditions of these observations, i.e., when looking at objects of unknown size and distance against a light sky. The objects may actually have been a flock of white birds, flying at a relatively low altitude and reflecting the light of the city.

Incidents 30, 30b, 30c, and 16, 16a, 16b, 16c.

During the same space of time (about half an hour) on the night of 7 January 1946 observers at Lockbourne Air Force Base, observers at Clinton County AFB and the pilot of an aircraft flying from Dayton to Washington reported an unidentified object in the sky. All reports agreed as to the color and general appearance of the object, and as to the fact that its light at times was visible through a light overcast. All agreed also that it was seen to the southwest. However, persons at all three locations judged the object to be only a few miles away to all of them it looked motionless at times, then appeared to gain and lose elevation. A very similar object was seen by numerous

persons at Fort Knox and other towns in Kentucky a few hours earlier. All saw it in the southwest and many thought it was only a few miles away. The Commanding Officer at Godman Field observed it for 1 1/2 hours, (beginning at 1405). During this time it seemingly remained stationary. It was "chased" by four National Guard pilots, one of whom crashed after having been up to 20,000 feet. It was also reported by persons in Lexington, Madisonville, and Elizabethtown.

The significant fact that emerges from these reports again is the inability to estimate distance. It appears possible that persons over parts of Kentucky and Ohio may have been seeing the same astronomical phenomena which was a great many miles away. Nevertheless each believed it to be relatively near his own location.

Incident No. 172.

A National Guard Pilot returning to Fargo, North Dakota, in a P-51 at approximately 2100 hours saw a small light in the air below him. He was then in the traffic pattern. He dived on the light. The light gained altitude. The pilot "chased" it up to 24,000 feet, making various passes at it and attempts to ram it as he climbed. He finally stalled out.

Several inferences can be drawn from the several reports about this incident. In the first place, when it is night, and a pilot is turning so steeply, and going such violent acrobatics, that he sometimes blacks out, as was the case here, it would be very difficult if not impossible to judge at the same time what another object was doing. In the second place, if the pilot kept his eyes intently on the object, as also was the case here, he would have great difficulty in knowing and reporting later what he himself was doing. The situation is very conducive to loss of orientation. In other words, it is impossible to infer

simply climbing steeply on a relatively straight course, such as would                      
be taken by a lighted weather balloon.                                                     
    As a matter of fact, a lighted weather balloon was released by                          
the Fargo Weather Station within 10 minutes of the time the light was                       
first sighted by the P-51 pilot. It is the opinion of the writer                           
that this lighted balloon easily could have accounted for all of the                       
pilot's observations. (It should be noted that the standard 30 inch

1100 ft./min. respectively.)

    In the proceeding section the hypothesis has been advanced that                         
most reports of unidentified flying objects have been the result                           
of persons failing to identify familiar phenomena, such as reflections                      
from bright surfaces in the day or lights in a night sky. It is                            
believed that this explanation will account for many of the reports.                       
However, some reports undoubtedly have other explanation.                                  
    Vertigo. The term vertigo covers a large group of miscellaneous                        
phenomena including air sickness, disbelief in one's instruments,                          
and partial loss of orientation. The conditions under which some of                         
the observations of flying objects were made were such that they could                     
have produced loss of orientation on the part of an observer. This                         
is especially true for those experiences occurring at night and those                      
in which attempts were made to "chase" the object. Movement is always                      
relative. If the only outside reference is a point of light, and both                      
the observer and the object observed are moving, it would be practically                   
impossible under certain conditions to tell which was moving and                           
which was not, or to separate out the two motions. It is hard enough                       
                                                                               UNCLASSIFIED

to fly a good pursuit curve on another aircraft in good daylight, for example, much less to close on a solitary light at night. The difficulty is due chiefly to the inability to judge distance or speed of a point source of light.

Suggestion: Suggestion works in various ways. Sensational radio and newspaper reports lead a few people to imagine they are seeing things they are not seeing. The effect on most people is to dampen their critical judgment. Under such conditions we are more likely to overlook certain factors, and find it easier to accept the suggested explanation uncritically. The expected result would be to make the reports of most observers slightly less accurate than if they had never heard reports of others seeing "flying saucers". Particularly when the stimulus object is fuzzy or ill-defined, persons tend to see it as resembling whatever is suggested to them. Carmichael et. al., for example (1932) showed individuals simple designs and gave them the name of an object. When the individuals drew the design from memory, they drew it to resemble whatever the object was that had been suggested to them.

Precedent: An historical precedent can be found for most errors of human observation. Although the writer has not tried to make an historical survey of reports of earlier unidentified aerial objects, he feels sure that there have been many such reports in years past, particularly during and after World War II.

Small Wind-borne Objects. It is possible that some observers may have seen small objects carried aloft by strong winds, or objects dropped from aircraft. Bits of paper, small cartons, etc., may occasionally be carried to a considerable height by strong winds. Aircraft may sometimes jettison small articles. It would be impossible to

estimate the distance, size or speed of such objects, and it would be
easy to fail to recognize them.

Conclusions

It is concluded by the writer that there are sufficient psychological
explanations for the reports of unidentified flying objects to
provide plausible explanations for reports not otherwise explainable.
These errors in identifying real stimuli result chiefly from inability
to estimate speed, distance and size.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are offered.

1. Test the ability of pilots to estimate the course of a small
lighted balloon while doing aerobatics with it at night. It is suggested
that several pilots try to fly pursuit curves and collision courses
on such targets at night and report accurately their sensations. It
would be desirable, but probably impossible, to keep them from knowing
the nature of the light source.

2. In all future reports of unidentified objects specify the
location of the object with reference to polar coordinates (direction
and degrees above the horizon) rather than asking individuals to estimate
distance. If possible, obtain an estimate of size in terms of the
visual angle subtended by the object.

3. In all future investigations determine the angular position
of the sun with respect to the unidentified object and the observer.
Also determine the approximate time during which the object was in
sight (this information was not available for more than half the
reports).

Third, if this type of investigation is to be continued,  
men with proved scientific and technical ability should be assigned  
to carry out the interrogations and investigations; It would be  
preferable either that the interrogator and technical specialist be  
the same person or, at least, that they work together in close har-  
mony. Such an arrangement would aid greatly in lessening the in-  
completeness and inexactness of evidence which has thus far hindered

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
WEATHER BUREAU
Report
Information on "Ball Lightning"
I. Origin

Various theories and suggestions have been proposed to explain ball lightning, most of them being without well-established physical foundation. There is still doubt in scientific circles regarding the origin of a number of reported cases of ball lightning.

Briefly, the explanations of the origin of ball lightning may be broken down as follows:

(1) Brush discharge (St. Elmo's fire).
(May be stationary over sharp-pointed objects, or moving along or near the surface of wires, roofs, rocks, etc., especially on mountains. Conditions most favorable for brush discharge occur during thunderstorms, but the phenomenon may occur even during clear, dry, dusty weather. When a lightning stroke is approaching an object, the brush discharge becomes especially intense.)

(2) Intensely ionized, incandescent volume of air forming end of lightning stroke and lasting for short interval of time.
(This would occur mainly during thunderstorms following the passage of a lightning stroke. At the ground end, the terminal flash is intense, and vapors, smoke or molten material from objects fused at points struck may enhance and extend the duration of incandescence. After-image formed on the retinas of the eyes of a person looking at the brilliant flash at the point of discharge may give spurious effects.)

(3) Brush discharge in air containing high concentration of dust or other aerosols, during thunderstorms.
(If this occurs, it probably is associated with the path taken by a real lightning stroke, and presumably involves corona discharges from suspended particles and possibly combustion in some cases.)

(4) Jumping of gap by lightning indoors.
(When lightning strikes a house, lightning streamers may jump gaps such as between pipes within the house, thus causing a brief flash of limited extent. After-
image is generally formed on the retina and movements of eye produce apparent movements of the illuminated region.)

(5) A cloud-to-ground lightning stroke with an associate, horizontally-directed, moving potential wave may possibly produce a transient horizontal potential gradient sufficiently intense to initiate electrical discharges.
(Such discharges would involve luminous dots moving at high speed and may move over irregular trajectories, producing, in some cases at least, more-or-less hori-
zontally directed, sinuous, ribbon-like or tubular paths. If there is a heavy concentration of electrical charges near the earth beneath the thunderstorm the triggering of a discharge by the transient potential gradient may yield horizontal lightning storms having a relatively slow propagation rate and long duration.)

(6) A lightning discharge that strikes and runs along a conductor such as power or telephone lines and flashes-
over or jumps the gaps at breaks produces a brilliant illumination at the gaps that may be mistaken for ball lightning.

(7) A piece of wire with attached light object that is car-
ried aloft by the gusty winds and turbulence attending a thunderstorm or tornado may serve to facilitate con-
duction of lightning currents and yield streamers at its ends during discharges.

(8) Spurious cases.

(a) After-image (persistence of vision)

(b) Will-o'-the Wisp

(c) Meteorites

(d) Reflections of lightning observed on highly polished objects, such as door knobs.

(e) Falling molten metal

(f) Lightning channel seen on end.

regular "masses of light." Appearance of outer boundary is generally hazy or ill-defined. Photographs of the
phenomenon may show one or several sinuous, tubular prop-
agation paths (trajectories taken by luminous darts), which may have associated with them broader luminous spaces of
irregular configuration. (These latter spaces probably are regions where the sinusities of paths became involved
and tortuous or areas of major discharge where darts originated or terminated). Some paths show a beaded struc-
ture (alternate luminous and dark spaces).

(b) Color

Luminous in appearance, described in individual cases by different colors but mostly reported as deep red and often as flaring white. One scientist described the color in a
certain case as similar to that he has noted in the labo-
ratory on observing active nitrogen, or possibly slightly
darker. Another observed one of yellow and still another
of lavender or rose color. Others have reported some of
blue appearance. The luminous mass is occasionally stated to be surrounded by a border, weakly but differently-
colored than the main body.

(c) Degrees of Brilliance

Brilliance not glaring; white and incandescent. Mini-
mum brilliance equal to that of feeble St. Elmo's Fire.

(d) Movement through Space

1. Possible directions.

Generally downward, inclined or horizontal, in straight, curved, or tortuous paths. Mostly observed near the surface, but may originate in thunderclouds, and so take a trajectory from cloud to earth.

2. Maneuverability

May appear stationary, or moving. Range of speed is zero to values of the order of 10^7 cm./sec. In the

latter, extreme case, the luminous darts observed are
probably of the same general nature as the lightning
streamer, although the paths taken may be very irratic—
ladders, even show reversals in direction. In some
cases, long sections of paths of such luminous darts
may show slight curvature. Near the ground or in
closed spaces a much smaller speed is often said to
be observed, mostly about 1 – 2 meters/sec. The "ball
of fire" may seem to move or float along in a room, or
to roll along the floor. In a thunderstorm, as may be
experienced on a mountain top, an observer has reported
seeing balls of fire roll along the rocks and hop
from one to another." Intense St. Elmo's Fire on ship
objects beneath thunderstorms may fluctuate rapidly in
size, intensity, and orientation, or show displacements
from one point to another, hence the flare may appear to
whirl and dance, or move. When a lightning flasher at
a point produces an after-image, or the observer's retina,
movements of the eyes cause corresponding movements to
the image which the untrained observer attributes to the
movement of a luminous "ball of fire" or flare. Ball
lightning observed by Jenson 1 during a thunderstorm
flash through dust-laden air in the wake of a lightning
"appeared as a shapeless mass of lavender color which
seemed to float slowly downward," Jensen states; "The
rose-colored mass seemed a brilliant near the ground
and gave the impression of not gigantic pyrotechnic dis-
play. Two or three of the globular structures seemed
to roll along a pair of 230 volt power lines for 100
feet or more, then bounded down on the ground and dis-
appeared with a loud report."

When a lightning streamer from a thundercloud terminates
in the air, the leader stroke is sometimes so faintly
luminous in portions that only a segment of the path is
observed. This may conceivably give the impression of
elongated "ball lightning," but is a natural cloud-air
lightning stroke.

3. Nearby Air or other Craft

                ---------------------

There have been numerous cases of aircraft struck by
lightning. When the aircraft is all-metallic, it serves
as a Faraday cage, and provides electrical protection

to the crew and passengers. Just preceding the onset of a lightning stroke to an aircraft, pilots have re-ported observing streamers of corona discharges build up on the nose, propellers or other extremity of the craft. The movement of the streamer accompanies that of the aircraft and depends on the passage of a light-ning stroke nearly or through the aircraft. Corona discharges on sharply convex surfaces of aircraft have also been observed during flight between masses of clouds strongly charged with electrical charges of opposite sign (positive and negative). Autogenous charging of the aircraft by the two-lobe bird precipi-tation particles intensifies the corona discharges. These are of the same nature as St. Elmo's Fire.

St. Elmo's Fire has been observed numerous times on the mastheads of ships and generally moves with them during passages beneath thunderclouds or other meteorological conditions where intense electrical potential gradients exist.

(c) Effect on Surrounding Atmosphere

I. Clouds

Lightning of any kind can occur in clouds only if the dielectric properties of the air are broken down when the sparking potential gradient is reached. In clear air this amounts to about 30,000 volts per cm. at sea level and about 21,000 volts per cm. at 10,000 ft. altitude. In clouds, or in the presence of precipi-tation particles the sparking potential gradient is less, depending on the size of the particles. For example, in the presence of raindrops 1/6 inch in diameter it is about 10,000 volts/cm.

As shown by Vonnegut, droplets of water suspended in an electrical field sufficiently intense to induce break-down will display sparking-over phenomena and will

become deformed. Under very strong fields, the drop-
lets become drawn out into filaments and disrupt with
attendant electrical discharges along their surfaces
or through them.

It is probable that these phenomena occur along the
channel of a lightning stroke through a cloud, and that 
some evaporational and disruptive breakdown of droplets
occur in consequence of the intense heat and flow of 
electrical charges. These major effects on cloud or
precipitation particles are believed to be confined to
the lightning channel, although minor effects such as
glow or brush discharges from particles in other portions
of the cloud possibly occur in connection with the de-
velopment of lightning strokes. These discharges from
countless particles may yield a general illumination
within the cloud under strong electrical field condi-
tions, especially during propagation of lightning strokes.

Effects of "Ball lightning" on clouds are unknown. Since
"Ball lightning," if real, is presumably less severe
than an ordinary lightning stroke or its nucleus is probably
a dart streamer of such a stroke, we may assume that the
effects of "Ball lightning" on clouds are not more severe
than those outlined above in connection with lightning.

2. Increased Ionization

The formation of corona discharges at any point leads to
a considerable increase in ionization of the surrounding
air. Any case of so-called "ball lightning" which is
actually a corona discharge will have a similar effect.

Ordinary lightning strokes distribute heavy concentra-
tions of electrons and ions or charged nuclei along and
near their channels during the passage of the stepped
leader or dart leader. These particles form a space
charge surrounding the channel. After the leader reaches
the earth, the return stroke occurs to form to ground.
When this develops, the space charge tends to migrate 
rapidly to the channel, producing a rush of charges within
it. The flow of these charges in the channel yields the
brilliant, return lightning stroke. Within the channel
ionization is exceedingly heavy.

"Ball lightning" associated with a true lightning stroke
will probably involve a flow of space charges to its

channel and so leads to a diminution of space charge from the environment of the path but an immediate in- 
crease of ionization along its path. Following the passage of the phenomenon, ionization will decay by recombination.

3. Nearby Air or Other Craft

All metallic aircraft which are struck by true light-
ning generally have scorch marks, pits, or holes burned
through the skin. The holes rarely exceed one inch in
diameter. (See NACA aircrash report Note 100.) Portions
of non-metallic material in contact with the area struck
may be burnt or explosively separated from the metal to
which the material is attached. When radio antennas are
struck or the lightning arrester does not function as
desired, damage to radio equipment often occurs.

Temporary blinding of pilots looking directly at the
flash due to the stroke to some exterior portion of the
aircraft such as the nose or the fuselage may introduce
some hazard. As a rule the temporary blind; in is ef-
fective from about 10 seconds to a lar ger fraction of a
minute, but in one extreme case a copilot was reported
to have been temporarily blinded for about 5 minutes.
Several cases of temporary blinding of about 3 minutes
have been reported.

The Weather Bureau has not received any reports of acci-
dents in which an airplane was said to have suffered
contact with "ball lightning." Judging by the phenomenon
called by that name and experienced at the surface, the
aircraft damage to be expected by such contact would
probably be less severe than that owed by a typical
genuine lightning stroke. The type of so-called "ball
lightning" which is actually an intense corona discharge
would not cause any mechanical damage to non-inflammable
exposed materials, but would hamper radio communications
by producing static similar to the kind termed "precipi-
tation static."

A real lightning stroke to a non-metallic object on the
ground often causes an explosive disruptive effect on the
object and will cause burning of inflammable materials.

Contact of so-called "ball lightning" may have physical
effects on exposed persons varying from negligible to

Fatal. In the cases of fatalities resulting from this
cause, it is believed that genuine lightning was involved. 
Physical effects of electrical origin on persons enclosed
in all-metallic aircraft are negligible, owing to the 
Faraday cage protection afforded by the conducting skin.
However, a slight electrical shock may be experienced by
a crew member aboard an aircraft if he is making good
contact at two well separated points during passage of
the stoop wave front of potential through the area of con-
tact at the time of a real lightning stroke.

(c) Accompanying Phenomena

1. Sound

The origination and dissipation of "ball lightning" at 
the surface are often attended by a sharp report, but
not invariably. Very frequently the beginning or end,
respectively, of "ball lightning" is accompanied by a
positively identified stroke of streak lightning or 
very nearly to the point of observation. The thunder
produced by such a stroke will naturally be considered
by many observers to have been associated with the "ball
lightning." "Ball lightning" which is in the form of a
corona discharge makes very little sound, since the cur-
rent carried is very low and the explosive heating effects
on the air negligible. Lightning of the continuous-
current type, with low-wavefront, will not produce intense
sounds, and this is to be more or less expected, also,
of isolated luminous dart streamers traversing the chan-
nels of preceding or succeeding lightning strokes. Such
streamers have been included in the category of "ball
lightning."

2. Chemical Effects

The odor of ozone in connection with "ball lightning" has
been reported by some observers. This is to be expected
in cases where the phenomenon is a brush discharge which
produces ozone in air. When actual streak lightning is
involved, the formation of oxides of nitrogen and ozone
is a normal occurrence.

3. Thermal Effects

Fires have been caused in combustible material, such as
straw, by discharges reported to have been "ball lightning."

incident #1, lo, ld, 1o -- Murco, California -- 8 July 1947

no astronomical explanation for this incident is possible.

It is tempting to explain the objects as ordinary aircraft  
observed under unusual light conditions, but the evidence of the  
"tight circle" maneuvers, if maintained, is strongly contradictory.  
This incident must be judged with reference to other similar inci-
dents, which probably have a common explanation.

4. Electrical Effects-
"Ball lightning" will certainly be accompanied by radio static in some form. Electrical shock to persons is possible when the phenomenon stems from streak lightning. Disruptive mechanical effects on non-conductors especially if containing moisture, or crushing effects on hollow conducting tubes may occur in cases where actual steep wave-front, lightning currents pass through the objects.

5. Optical Appearances
Some of the cases of "ball lightning" observed have displayed exorescences of the appearance of little flames, emanating from the main body of the luminous mass, or luminous streamers have developed from it and propagated slant-wise toward the ground. In rare instances, it has been reported that the luminous body may break up into a number of smaller balls which may appear to follow towards the earth like a rain of sparks. It has often been reported that the ball has suddenly ejected a whole bundle of many luminous, radiating streamers toward the earth, and then disappeared.

Jensan1 has quoted the following report of electrical discharges appear:in, in a violent storm, "A tornado which occurred on the evening of July 9, 1952, near Rock Rapids, Iowa, gave evidence of a closely related type of luminous display according to the report of Mr. George Ravellings, U. S. Weather Bureau observer. From the sides of the boiling, thrust-down cloud a fiery stream poured like water through a sieve, breaking into spheres of irregular shape as they descended. No streak lightning of the usual type was observed and no noise attended the fire-balls other than the usual roar of the storm."

(d) Possible Objects to Which Attracted
Lightning strokes are more likely to hit at or near the top of high, pointed objects, than on the surfaces of low objects with flat or concave exteriors. If the tips of the high objects are grounded via conductors such as wires or metal pipes, they will tend to show a higher frequency to strikes than ungrounded objects. This is especially true if, in the former case, the.

ground is well moistened or possesses an extensive network of
conducting elements (water pipes, telephone and electric cables,
etc.)

It follows that the lightning flash will be observed more fre-
quently at these relatively high points than elsewhere, and
hence probably that "ball lightning" will appear to develop quite
commonly at such points.

Brush discharges tend to form at sharply convex extremities of
objects, and align themselves in the direction of the potential
gradient. Tall-grounded conducting objects would generally
receive preference. These considerations apply to cases which
were classified by the layman as "ball lightning" but actually
were cases of St. Elmo's Fire (bright glow or brush discharges.)

There have been reports by observers of "ball lightning" to the
effect that the phenomenon appeared to float through a room or
other space for a brief interval of time without making contact
with or being attracted by objects. Filmer and Workman1 have
published a reproduction of moving film camera photographs of
unusual discharges during thunderstorms. In the case of the phe-
nomenon observed at Santa Fe, New Mexico (elevation 7000 feet)
on the night of September 3, 1936, these authors state "The
cameras were mounted rigidly on a bench in a portable laboratory.
The discharge was probably about 100 feet from the cameras,
although the exact distance is not known since no thunder assoei-
ated with this flash could be distinguished from the general
background of thunder. The discharge occurred within less than
one-thousandth of a second after an intense cloud ground stroke
at some distant portion of the storm. Analysis of the photo-
graphs indicates that the discharge consisted of at least four
luminous darts moving with a perceived velocity of the order of
10 m/sec. The most notable features of this discharge are
(1) its irregularity of path and rapid reversals in direction,
(2) its proximity to ground objects with no apparent contact with
the ground, (3) the broad nature of the path, and (4) the progress
of the discharge in two directions from a single point."

Note should be made of the fact that the luminous darts did not
appear to be attracted to available ground objects even though
they were in the vicinity of the ground. On this basis it cannot
be stated whether there are any definite objects to which all
cases of "ball lightning" would be attracted. We should think
that sharp-pointed, grounded objects are most likely to attract
"ball lightning."

(h) Methods of Terminal Dissipation

As a rule so-called "ball lightning" of the variety which we
judge to be intense brush discharge dissipates when the poten-
tial gradient diminishes to a value below the critical one for
maintenance of the discharge. This generally occurs following
lightning strokes which largely discharge the heavy concentra-
tions of electric charges of opposite sign in the overlying
thundercloud.

"Ball lightning" which appears to form at sharp-pointed objects
as a lightning stroke approaches disappears when (a) the main 
lightning current ceases following just after contact of the stroke
or (b) the space charge around the lightning channel is largely 
collected into the channel and transported to earth or cloud.

"Ball lightning" which appears to be a luminous dart like a
meteorite rapidly falling (or rising) along the path of an
immediately preceding or succeeding lightning stroke disappears
into the earth (or cloud).

"Ball lightning" in the form of a luminous ball apparently moving
through a space or rolling along the ground dissipates eventually,
perhaps on making contact with some object. Some observers have
stated that the ball collapses with a noise resembling that of a 
big firecracker, leaving an odor of ozone. It seems probable
that in these cases also the dissipation takes place when the
potential gradient has diminished below the critical value for
maintenance of the discharge, simultaneously with the occurrence 
of a genuine lightning stroke to the area involved.

As indicated previously, reports have also been given that the
main body of the "ball lightning" has appeared to have broken up
into a number of smaller "balls" which have fallen to earth, or
to have emitted small streaks, like lightning, projected towards
the earth, and thus dissipated.

A sound of thunder, of greater or lesser intensity, may accom-
pany the dissipation. It is not possible to be certain that the
sound is always intricately connected with the phenomenon, for it
may have been the thunder associated with a nearby lightning
stroke.

APPENDIX I

In the following section of this report, each remaining unexplained incident is considered separately. It is not the intent to generally discredit the character of observers, but each case has undesirable elements, and these cannot be disregarded. The numerical designation is merely the categorical order of the incident in the project files.

Incident No. 1 - 8 July 1947, 0930 hours local, Muroc Air Force Base. Four witnesses, all observed two silver disc like or spherical objects against a clear bright sky. All witnesses estimated the altitude at about 3000 feet, and the speed between 300 and 400 mph. It is possisble to estimate distance and speed of an object with a fair degree of accuracy if the size is known. The distance is judged on the known size and speed on an estimate of distance, plus angular change in position (see page 3, app. G). In this incident the size could not be known, owing to the fact that the object was not identified. The time in sight and angular distance traveled were not given. However, the first witness stated he sighted the objects at 0950, and the last witness said he was called to view the objects at l000. The object's time in sight was therefore estimated to be at least one-half hour. The objects reportedly traveled in a straight line. Taking the mean reported speed (350 MPH), the objects must then have traveled 175 MPH while in sight. If the object's were of such proportions as to be seen at that distance, it is believed that more details could have been observed at the first sighting. Two additional remarkable aspects of this case are:

1. A few moments previous to the sighting, the first witness was engaged in conversation. Quoting the witness, "My part in this conversation was as follows: 'Someone will have to show me one of those discs before I will believe it.'"

2. The statements of the three other witnesses were made to the first witness. All three agree almost identically with the first. It is probable, therefore, that their evidence was influenced by suggestion.

AIC Opinion: This report is a result of misinterpretation of the nature of real stimuli, probably research balloons.

The text in the document reads as follows:

Incident No. 10 — 4 July 1947, 2004 hours, Boise, Idaho. An airline
pilot and crew watched from the air two groups, (5 and 4 in number) of objects
described as thin and smooth on the bottom and rough on top, silhouetted
against sunset and flying "Loose formation." They followed them for forty-five
minutes; therefore, had them in sight for approximately ten minutes. No further
information was submitted. 

ATIC Opinion: Since the sighting occurred at sunset, when light con-
ditions change rapidly and illusory effects are most likely, the objects
could have been ordinary aircraft, balloons, birds, or pure illusion. In-
sufficient information.

Incident No. 17 - 21, June 1947, afternoon, Mt. Rainier, Washington.
One witness viewed nine, “saucer-like discs” from the air calculated to be
20 to 25 miles distant and 45 - 50 feet in length, (about 2 times as long as
wide) which traveled 47 miles in 102 seconds (1700 MPH). Dr. Hynek calculated
mathematically (see Appendix B) that assuming the estimate of distance to be
accurate, in order to see such detail, the objects would need to have been at
least 100 feet thick, therefore, 2000 feet long. If the estimated size is
more nearly correct, then to have been seen as described, the objects would
have been roughly six miles distant. At this distance they would have traveled 
only 1½ miles in 102 seconds, or approximately 1000 MPH. The entire report of 
this incident is replete with inconsistencies. It is to be noted that the ob-
server has profited from this story by selling it to Fate magazine.

AIC Opinion: The report cannot bear even superficial examination, there-
fore, must be disregarded. There are strong indications that this report and
its attendant publicity is largely responsible for subsequent reports.

Incident No. 21 - 29 June 1947, 1645, Des Moines, Iowa.
The observer, a bus driver, reported observing thirteen objects at 1200 ft
altitude, traveling in a straight line in file at 300 mph. The objects were
elliptical in form "inverted saucer," in traffic terms 2-3 ft in diameter,
dirty white, and made a sound like an electric motor or dynamo. There was
no further information supplied except that the observer stated they looked
like dots in the sky.

AMC Opinion: These objects were seen just outside Des Moines, and were
flying towards Des Moines. If they were not ordinary objects mistaken for some-
thing else by the observer, but were really unusual aircraft, it seems almost
certain that someone else would have also reported them. There is insufficient
information for a proper analysis.

Incident No. 29 - 14 June 1947, 1200 and 1215, Murocfield, Calif.
The observer, an experienced pilot, reported sighting ten and later seven
objects at 2500 ft altitude, traveling 370 MPH in a loose "V" formation.
Although the objects were apparently at a considerable distance, the reporter
described them as being similar to the XSOU "Flying Flapjack." He stated
that he attached no particular importance to this sighting until the rad of
the Cascade Mountain sightings (Incident No. 17). He then recalled this incident.

AIC Opinion: There is no information contained in this report to contro
the assumption that these objects were ordinary aircraft beyond the range of
identification. The fact that no one else in Murocfield reported observing
anything unusual, tends to substantiate this conclusion.

Incident No. 35 -- 14 October 1947, 1200 hours, eleven miles north,
N.E. of Cave Creek, Arizona.

Two mine operators observed one object at 8000 to 10,000 ft altitude, traveling
350 mph, S.E in a straight line for a period of 45 seconds. The object was
red against the sky, and black against a cloud. Its size appeared to be three feet
in diameter from point of observation. The OSI report of investi,gation states
that one observer thought it was a buzzard, but decided later that it was not;
the other observer said it resembled a flying wing, but was not a flying wing.
No reasons are given for these apparently superfluous and conflicting remarks.
As in many other instances, these observers cited their flying experience as
qualification for their ability to observe and report details.

AIC Opinion: From the limited data furnished in this report, it is 
difficult to arrive at any conclusion. If the object was actually 10,000 ft 
distant, and yet appeared three feet wide to the observer, it would of necessity 
been huge. This sole point of contention tends to discredit the report.

Incident No. 37 - 14 October, 1947, 1200 hours, eleven miles North, 
N. E. of Cave Creek, Arizona.

Two mine operators observed one object at 8000 to 10,000 ft altitude, travel-
ing 350 MPH S.E. in a straight line for a period of 45-60 seconds. The object 
was red against the sky, and black against a cloud. It appeared to be three 
feet in diameter from point of observation. The OSI report of investigation states 
that one observer thought it was a buzard, but decided later that it was not; 
the other observer said it resembled a flying wing, but was not a flying wing. 
No reasons are given for those apparently square/fluous and conflicting remarks. 
As in many other instances, these observers cite their flying experience as 
qualification for their ability to observe and report details.

A/C Opinion: From the limited data furnished in this report, it is 
difficult to arrive at any conclusion. If the object was actually 10,000 ft 
distant, and yet appeared three feet wide to the observer, it would of necessity 
been huge. This sole point of contention tends to discredit the report.

Incident No. 10 — 7 July 1947, 1600 hours, Phoenix, Arizona.
One observer witnessed an elliptical, flat, gray object, measuring 20-30
ft across, flying 400-500 MPH, spiraling downward to 2000 ft from 5000 ft,
then ascending at a 45° angle to an overcast. Observer ran into a garage,
where he obtained a Kodak Brownie 120 box camera, and snapped two pictures;
one negative, and a print of the other, are contained in project files.
The negative displays a small apparently flat object rounded on one end,
and pointed on the other. The object appears to have a hole in the center.
The image is in stark contrast with the back-ground of clouds. From the print,
the object appears to be jet black with sharp outlines. Four expert photo-
graphers concur in the opinion that the image is of true photographic nature,
However, they disagree with each other as to the possibility of faking such
an occurrence under the conditions described. Considering the object was gray
as described, and at a distance of 2000 feet, it seems unlikely that it would
appear pure black on the print. In subsequent correspondence to the reporter
of this incident, the observer refers to himself as Chief of Staff of Panoramic
Research Laboratory, the letterhead of which lists photography among one of its
specialties. Yet, the negative was carelessly cut and hastily developed. It
is covered with streaks and overlaid a roll of six months, fully developed expo-
sures. An OSI agent discovered that a letter by this observer was published by
Amazing Stories magazine early this year. In this letter he stated that he
had been interviewed by two Federal agents, had given them pictures of "flying
discs" and that the pictures had not been returned. He requested the advice of
the magazine as to how to proceed to sue the Government. This individual is
aware of the whereabouts of those pictures, but has never requested their return.
There are other undesirable aspects to this case. The observer's character and
business affiliations are presently under investigation, the results of which
are not yet known. Dr. Irving Langmuir studied subject photographs, and after
learning of the prior passage of a thunderstorm, discounted the photo-graphed
object as being merely paper swept up by the winds.

AIC Opinion: In view of the apparent character of the witness, the con-
clusion by Dr. Langmuir seems entirely probable.

Incident No. 51 — 3 September 1947, 1215 hours, Corvallis, Oregon.
A housewife observed twelve to fifteen round, silver-colored objects at a
high altitude. No further information was submitted; therefore, no conclusion

Incident No. 58 — 1 August 1947, Sunset, near Bethel, Alaska.
A pilot and his co-pilot observed a black object of the design and approximate dimensions of a C-54 fuselage, flying at 500-1000 ft altitude N.W. The object crossed their path at right angle, and they pulled up to 2000 ft to avoid a collision, then chased it at 170, but lost sight of it in four minutes. They estimated the speed of the object to be three times their own, or 510 M.P.H. Assuring the estimate of speed to be correct, elementary computations determine the distances object traveled as 34 miles in four minutes while the observer's airplane moved eleven miles in the same period. Therefore, the object was more than twenty miles distant when last seen. To be capable of being seen at this distance under the conditions given, the object would have to be about 50 feet in diameter or 5-6 on dimensions. If this were true, and the object was proportionate with a C-54 fuselage, its length would be about 500 ft. Assuming the estimate of speed to be incorrect, but time in sight to be correct, the problem is figured in reverse, using as a reasonable width 15 ft. In this event the object would have been less than ten miles away when lost to sight, therefore, it would have traveled about eighteen miles in four minutes, giving a speed of less than 300 M.P.H.

AC Opinion: It is believed that the pilots were suddenly startled by a convent NL aircraft crossing their path, and that as they gave chase to the aircraft which was 'flighted' against a brilliant evening sky, they were partially blinded, and were therefore unable to discern wings or engines.

Incident No. 62 - 8 September 1947, 2200-2300 hours, Logan, Utah.
A man and his wife, together with five other unidentified people, observed five
groups each of 35-50 small objects, yellowish-white in color, flying several
thousand feet in the air at a high rate of speed. The weather was cloudy.

ATIC Opinion: From the limited evidence submitted, it is practically
impossible to formulate a conclusion. Fast motion could be attributed to close-
ness rather than to true linear distance. In an atmosphere of darkness, any im-
pression may be erroneous. Ground lights reflected from moving, low-hanging
clouds, themselves not visible, could readily account for this report. Light
colored birds are another possibility.

Incident No. 64 — 19 August 1947, 2130 hours, Twin Falls, Idaho.
Several people were reported as sighting numerous groups of objects in the
night sky. These objects were described as a glow in the air with a color
similar to regular electric lights. The objects were said to have traveled
at "terrific speed". Some flew in triangular formation. Three objects pulled
off of one group or tane, and proceeded on their course. The sky was over-
cast. Two observers stated that the objects could not have been birds since
the lights were not a reflection of city lights.

A/IC Opinion: Many familiar objects visible because of the fact that 
they reflect light, appear to be incandescent; for example, the moon and
certain planets. The evidence is, therefore, contradictory since as not being
reflectory. The submitted evidence has really a glow, and later on as not in-
stances the objects are described as merely a complex reflection incident 6Z;
ground lights reflected from clouds, or birds in flight.

Incident #5 -- Maroo, California -- 7 July 1947

There is no astronomical explanation of this incident.

In this investigator's opinion, there is nothing in the
evidence offered that is basically contradictory to the hypothesis
of a weather balloon. Perhaps ascending currents of warm air over
the desert could give the illusion that the object was oscillating.

Incident No. 68 — 24 June 1947, Daytime, Cascade Mountains, Washington.
A prospector reported sighting five or six round objects with tails, 1000 ft overhead, heading S.E., and banking in the sun. The objects were in sight 45-60 seconds
and alleged to be thirty feet in diameter. They made no noise. While the objects
were within sight, the observers compass 
fluctuated wildly. He states that he
read of a similar sighting (Incident No. 17) also occurring on 24 June 1947, and
outlined those 8-10 closely
in form to those seen. While in 
this
story. While there appears to be an attempt on the part of the observer to in-
fer that these objects were possibly the same as those reported in (Incident No.
17), there are several major differences, notably as Dr. Hynek points out (app.2), 
that these objects had tails, and that the inferred size, as determined from
the estimated distance, is quite different. Dr. Valley (App 1) has pointed out
and Dr. Hynek concurred that it is difficult to imagine any
the poler action 
of the compass for this would imply fantastically large magnetic fields.

AEC Opinion: From the limited evidence submitted, it is impossible to reach a definite conclusion. However, two possible physiological factors are readily apparent; one, the observer stated he published photos or 
or poor sleep because he,
had read several days following his observation of another sighting. Therefore,
he very likely either consciously or inadvertently may have attempted to conform
his report to that recounted in the newspaper; and two, he colored his report
with inference of huge magnetic fields, as to the implications of which he was obviously uninformed.

Incident No. 7 – 8 or 9 October 1947, daytime, Las Vegas, Nevada. An Air Force Reserve pilot reported observing a trail appearing high in the sky at an estimated speed of 1000-1000 MPH. The object producing the trail was not visible. The trail was white as a cloud, and dissipated in fifteen to twenty minutes. The object proceeded in a straight line, then it made an approximately 120° turn of radius five to fifteen miles, and proceeded away toward the direction of first appearance. The weather was described as “almost cloudless.”

AMC Opinion: It is difficult to understand why this individual attached any importance to this sighting and why he did not conclude that the trail was caused by exactly what it appears to have been; that is, an ordinary aircraft flying normally at an altitude too high for itself to be visible, but in the best altitude range to form vapor trails 20,000 – 45,000 feet.

Incident No. 75 -- 13 August 1947, 1300 hours, Snake River Canyon, Idaho.
A farmer together with his two sons, ten and eight years of age, witnessed an object move down a canyon. It was in view only momentarily at a distance of 300 feet, and approximately 75 feet above the ground. The object made a swishing sound, and was sky-blue in color. The farmer doubted the possibility of its visibility if viewed against the sky. The children told of smokeless turbine or exhaust flames shooting from the device through which could be seen daylight. The object passed over some trees, which in the words of the farmer, "spun around on top as if they were in a vacuum."

ATC Opinion: It seems logical to concur with Dr. Hynek's deduction, that this object was simply a rapidly moving atmospheric eddy.

Incident No. 76 – 13 August 1947, Salmon Dam, Idaho.

Two men reported simultaneously hearing a roar, and looking up observed two objects of undetermined size several miles distant. The objects were "circular, thought to have been 1000-2000 feet at greatest height which they reflected light", and were travelling at "great speed". Although occurring on the same day as Incident No. 75, the descriptions vary widely.

AEC Opinion: There is no information contained in this report to refute the assumption that these men saw two ordinary aircraft at too great a distance to discern details.

Incident No. 77 – 3 July 1947, 1430 Hours, South Brooksville, Maine. 
This observer, an "astronomer", heard a loud roar and with difficulty observed at 50° elevation approximately ten very light objects traveling N.W. The group held together with no regular formation. He claimed that the sky, cloudless to more than two over 1-1/2° angular diameter in that at a distance of 10 miles the objects would have a speed of 1200 MPH; that their width must be 100 feet across and due to their color would be barely visible. He also estimated the dB of 300 would have a width of fifty feet at five miles with a speed of 600 MPH. He believed they were aircraft of some type, owing to the loud roar. In his letter he asked, "have any meteorites been reported?"

AMC Opinion: It is believed that the observer should have been able to rule out the possibility of meteorites. Reducing the estimate of distance, and correspondingly reducing the required size to that of objects such as birds or insects, then the speeds become very modest. If the objects were actually five to ten miles distant, and responsible for the "unusually loud roar," it is expected that numerous other reports would have been received from this section of Maine, which is thickly populated.

Incident No. 79 -- April 1947, Richmond, Virginia
A weather bureau observer at the Richmond Station observed on three dif-
ferent occasions, during the six-month period prior to April 1947, a
disc-like metal chrome object. All sightings were made through a theo-
dolite while making pilot observations. On the last reported sighting,
the balloon was at 15,000 feet altitude, the disc followed for fifteen
seconds. It was shaped like an ellipse with a flat level bottom and a
dome-like top. The altitude and speed were not estimated, but the ob-
ject, allegedly through the instrument, appeared larger than the bal-
loon. Another observer at the same station saw a similar object under
corresponding circumstances, with the exception that her balloon was
at an altitude of 27,000 feet and possessed a dull metallic luster.
There was good visibility on day of observation. Report of this
sighting was not submitted until 22 July 1947.

AMC Opinion; There is no readily apparent explanation. If there
were only one such object, it seems amazing coincidental that it
would be seen four times near the pibal of this station only. On the
other hand, there would have to have been a great number of these ob-
jects to rule out coincidence, and as the number of objects increases
so do the chances of sightings by other witnesses.

Incident No. 41 - 7 July 1947, 1300-1400 hours, Lakeland, Fla.
One observer reported bearing a swishing noise and then seeing, five 
shiny objects climbing from 5000 ft to 7500 ft in fifteen to thirty 
seconds. He estimated the objects were one mile from him. The lead 
object was of plastic appearance and appeared to be towing the other 
four. The reporter made a model and exhibited it to an exhibit. The 
model is roughly two feet in diameter, domed top and bottom and with an 
opening in the rear on either side of a vertical fin. Police records 
list the man as having been AWOL from the Navy on two occasions. A 
neighborhood employment check disclosed he is an excitable person, 
very talkative and nosey, in an ex-aggravating manner, and inclined to 
impress people with his continuous verbal chatter.

AMC Opinion: This incident has all the aspects of a psychopath-
ological report.

Incident No. III — 1 April 1947, 0955 Hours, Central Philippines.
An F-47 pilot leading three other aircraft at 1500 ft saw an object approximately three miles away at 1000 ft. Object appeared to be a flying wing thirty by twenty feet, silver in color. The pilot turned to intercept the object and in five seconds or more the platinum colored object turned distant into the object too. Object appeared to have a dorsal fin but from size was too great to note any other features. The report does not reveal whether any of the other pilots saw the object.

AFC Opinion: No definite explanation. However, every pilot has experienced the sensation of seeing an aircraft obliquely at nearly the limit of vision and then losing sight at the same range when the aircraft presented, in storm view, a smaller surface.

Incident No. 122 – 5 April 1948, Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.

Three balloon observers saw an object very high in the sky, moving faster than any known aircraft and possessing a rounded distinct form, which disappeared suddenly. It was seen less than thirty seconds and was apparently not manned, judging by its violent maneuvers. For analogous also they stated if the moon were the size of an orange, the object would approximate the size of a disco.

ATIC Opinion: No explanation. However, the above comparison of size is to be noted. A dime held at arms length would shield the moon from the eye even if the moon appeared several times larger than it does. To reduce the proportion then, this object must have appeared as an infinitesimal point. From trained observers, this is certainly a major discrepancy.

Incident No. 144. -- 23 May 1949, 1300 hours, Monroe, Michigan.
One passenger in a C-47 at 5000 ft observed three disc-like objects
and later two more (another observer saw only two two). The objects
appeared to disappear from above, level off at altitude of C-47 and
travel in the opposite direction at terrific speed. They left no trail,
were disc shaped and were "silvery-cold" or "shiny brass" in color.
One observer said they were 300-400 feet across with well rounded
contours, the other said they were four feet in size. The first ob-
server later said all had a hazy or fuzzy outline. There was an over-
cast at 15,000 feet and a thin, broken stratus layer at 5000 feet, the
level of the aircraft.

AF Opinion: Dr. Hynek suggests those individuals could have seen
successive flashes of sunlight through breaks in the high overcast il-
luminating portions of the lower cloud stratus. Apparent speed could
be a combination of projected motion of the break in the overcast and
the velocity of the C-47. This explanation partially fits the contra-
dictory evidence.

ABSTRACT

A Technical Intelligence Report covering the method of investigation of unidentified flying objects and results obtained to date is presented.

The report discusses in full the history of the project, the problems encountered, and the procedures followed in the investigation and evaluation of reports of unidentified flying objects. Since the project is continuous in nature, this report comprehensively treats reports of sightings only up to January 1949. Work is continuing on later reports.

Incident No. 135 - Between 15 and 20 August 1947, 2130 hours, 
Wauver, South Dakota.

An Air Force officer saw twelve "flying discs" four miles away over the 
Rapid City air Force base in a "tight diamond" formation at 4000 to 
10,000 feet descending to 6000 feet at 500 MPH. Objects made a forma-
tion turn and climbed at 300 to 400 degrees climbing. Objects were very 
maneuverable, remaining equally spaced in all maneuvers. Each object 
was 100 feet in length, oval-shaped and brilliant yellowish-whites. No 
sound nor exhaust trail were heard or seen.

AC Opinion: This reporter should be a reliable observer. How-
ever, It has been shown that distance cannot be estimated without prior
knowledge of the size of an object. If distance is not known, speed 
cannot be estimated. More notable perhaps is that such observation
could be remembered in a report made one year after the minute detail
and yet the date was not remembered. Dr. Fykec suggested the possibil-
ity of detached auroral streamers.

Incident No. 151 – 29 July 1948, 0955 hours, Indianapolis, Indiana.
The observers driving a truck saw an object shaped like a broad short propeller traveling 25-30 ft. in a bank just above the trees at thirty ft altitude. It was about 40 feet long, two feet wide and one foot thick, with "cups" on the upper sides of the blades. The object collided with no spinning action, and there was no sound or trail. The object was thought to have fallen, but a search revealed nothing.

A/C Opinion: No satisfactory conclusion can be drawn.

A man and his wife saw an object shaped like a cymbal, lusterless white in color, at an altitude of 2000 ft. The object moved across the sky to the east at approximately 1000 MPH, on a level course and shimmering in the sun, giving the appearance of spinning. It was twenty foot in diameter and six to eight foot high in the center. There was no sound or exhaust.

ATIC Opinion: This object could conceivably be the same or different objects as that seen in Incident 151, although all the remaining evidence is widely divergent. No satisfactory conclusion can be drawn.

An attorney and his wife observed an object moving south over the 
center of Columbus at 1500-2000 ft altitude. During the ten to 
fifteen minutes the object remained in sight, it changed shape from 
that of a parallelogram to a circle and back again, direction of travel 
remained constant. Once it seemed to disappear and then all of 
smoke appeared from the rear. The smoke started as a thin trail 
line of the object was dark gray or black, but the center seemed to be 
transparent. Object was judged to be 20 to 30 feet in diameter.

AIR Opinion: There is no reason to believe other than that this 
object was a research balloon, of which there are many types, and that 
the "trail of smoke" appeared so from a momentary glimpse of trailing
apparati.

Two children, ages ten and eight, described a dull gray object two

which settled gently to the ground. It clanked when it touched down.
On the ground it emitted a whistling noise and "shot" up to twenty feet 
where it hesitated, whistled once more, "shot" up to thirty feet, then 
"shot" off in a northeast direction.

ATC Opinion: This apparent bit of fantasy is hardly worth further

The object had two decks and no wings, was said to be very high, with
speed comparable to V-2.

out that the V-2 is not visible in flight, therefore, it follows that
this object would not have been visible as described if travelling at
that speed.

Incident No. 176 - 23 Sept. 1948, 1200 hours, San Pablo, Calif.
On a still hazy day, two men saw a large translucent object over a mile
overhead. It was the size of a four-engine bomber, but "gray in color,
and appeared to be made of wax." According to the first observer,
the apparent position was spherical and undulated, having appendages fore 
and aft, like an amoeba. The second observer said the object looked 
like "a vegetable crate" covered with translucent material. The in-
vestigator states one observer's description was "not too good --
due to the other. One observer was far-sighted but wore no glasses,
the other was over seventy, needed glasses to read but wore none at 
time of sighting. 

AMC Opinion: The only fact that might be accepted is that an ob-
ject was seen. Two observers, side by side, could not agree on its
appearance. The evidence is useless. A balloon or cluster of balloons,
an aircraft, or a cloud could have been the stimulus.

Airborne radar observer in F-51 attempted six times to intercept an  
object between 5000 and 6000 ft. The object traveled 200 MPH until  
approached to within 1,200 ft., then quickly accelerated. Pilot saw  
at estimated 1200 ft. Object appeared to be 20-30 ft. long from  
silhouette to underside of object with rounded nose. General pro-  
tile shape, cut off sharply at rear.  

AMC Opinion: There is no apparent explanation. One discrepancy  
seems to be that the target was never seen by ground radar, which was  
operating and had the F-51 in sight throughout period of sighting.

Incident #5 -- Portland, Oregon -- 4 July 1947

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident, nor for numerous others (i.e., 7, 9, 12, 15, 14, 16) which occurred in and near Portland on the Fourth of July, 1947.

Besides being observed in the same vicinity and most of the time at the same time, the objects seen have in common a round shape, "terrific" speed, abrupt tactics, and quick disappearance. Abrupt tactics certainly suggest that the objects were of a very light weight.

This investigator can offer no definite hypothesis, but in passing would like to note that these incidents occurred on the Fourth of July, and that if relatively small pieces of aluminum foil had been dropped from a plane over that area, then any one object would become visible at a relatively short distance. Given moderate wind velocities could give the illusion that fluttering, gyrating discs had come by at great velocities. Various observers would now, of course, in this case have seen the same objects.

The above is not to be regarded as a very likely explanation but only as a possibility; the occurrence of these incidents on July 4 may have been more than a coincidence. Some prankster might have tossed such objects out of an airplane as part of an Independence Day celebration.

If these were aircraft of either known or unknown type,

Incident No. 207 - 16 Nov. 1952, 2200 hours, Andrews Air Force
Base, Maryland.
The pilot of a T-6 reported seeing an object over the base at 1700 feet.
Object was onion-bolt ball with one light, no wings, no exhaust, in land-
ing lights of T-6. It had a dull gray glow and was thought to be smaller
than the T-6. Pilot made passes and object evaded by going above air-
craft. T-6 tried to close in very tight climbing turns, but object
turned inside this aircraft. Object was lost after ten minutes at 7500
feet. Its speed seemed to vary between 10 MPH and 60 MPH.

ATIC Opinion: That the object described was a synoptic balloon.
Dr. Fitts's report shows that it is very difficult for the observer to
separate target motion and his own motion even in daylight, and prac-
tically impossible to do so at night. This fact has been substantiated
by the writer, who in controlled experiments attacked ordinary balloons
with T-6 in daylight, and with knowledge of what the object was and
what it did, all the above described maneuvers were duplicated in ap-
pearance.

Incident No. 236 – 4 Jan. 1949, 11400 hours, Hickam Field, Territory of Hawaii.
An air force pilot saw an object which appeared to be a large round piece of flat cardboard the size of a T-6. It was white underneath and dark on top. It approached from 25 mile distance at 3000 ft and circled the area at 65. The object seemed to "blink" a "whitish reflection" regularly. It departed climbing at 250 angle.

ATIC Opinion: The evidence does not lead to an explanation. It should be noted, however, that if the object were actually the size of a T-6 at 3000 feet, a greater amount of detail should have been observed.

One minor lead is suggested: observation was made at the time of sunset, when light conditions are changing rapidly. Disappearance of the object might have occurred simply because of the changing visibility. It is the time of day when illusory effects are most likely to occur, and it might not be out of the question that the objects actually were other aircraft.

Despite these conjectures, no logical explanation for the incident seems possible at this time.

UNCLASSIFIED
Incident #17 -- Lt. Gander, Washington -- 24 Juno 1947

There appears to be no astronomical explanation for this
classic incident, which is the prototype of many of the later flying
saucer stories.

It is impossible to explain this incident away as sheer
nonsense, if any credence at all is given to Mr. Arnold's integrity.
However, certain inconsistencies can be pointed out in the facts as
reported:

Arnold's attention was first drawn to the objects by a
bright flash on his plane, which was followed by numerous other similar
flashes. If these were something like the flash one gets from a dis-
tant mirror, it means that the reflection was specular, or direct.
For a direct reflection, the angle between the observer, sun, and ob-
ject must be "just right," and at such distances as 20 or 25 miles,
the chance of a series of direct reflections is extremely small. If
the object was a diffuse reflector -- that is, scattering the sunlight
falling on it, much as the moon or a balloon does -- then at such a
distance it seems quite unlikely that Mr. Arnold would have been
startled, or that our attention would have been called to it, unless
the objects reflecting were extremely large.

The supersonic speeds called for if the estimated distance
is correct also throw suspicion on the original calculations: by
computation (see below) it can be seen that, considering the detail
which Arnold observed in the objects, at least one of his estimates

Incident #17 -- page 2

must have been erroneous!

Arnold states that the objects seemed about 20 times as long
as wide. Let us assume that the thickness was just discernible, which
means that the object was just at the limit of resolution of the eye.
Now, the eye cannot resolve objects that subtend an angle of appreciably
less than 3 minutes of arc, and, in general, for any detail to be seen
at all, the angle subtended must be much greater. Even if we assume
the limiting resolution of 3 minutes, then, if the distance was 25 miles,
elementary calculations show that the object must have been at least
100 feet thick, and if, as Arnold's drawings indicate, the object was
some 20 times longer than wide, it must have been about 2000 feet long.

Looking at the matter in another way and assuming that Arnold's
estimate of distance as 20 to 25 miles (12,000 feet) and his estimate
of length as 45 to 50 feet are both correct, then it can be shown that
the object will subtend an angle of only about 10 seconds of arc, which
is definitely below the limit of resolution of the eye.

If Arnold actually saw the objects, and if his estimates of
distance is correct, that of size cannot be, and vice versa. It
seems most logical to assume that his estimate of distance is far too
great. In fact, assuming a reasonable limiting size to the objects of
400 feet, in order to show the detail that Arnold's drawings indicate,
the distance must have been not over roughly six miles. At this dis-
tance the objects would have travelled 11 miles (rather than 47 miles)
in 102 seconds, or at a rate of approximately 400 m.p.h. (Arnold's

original estimate is also incorrect; if the objects had traveled 47
miles in 102 seconds, they would have been travelling at a rate of
approximately 1700 m.p.h., not 1200.)

In view of the above, it appears probable that whatever ob-
jects were observed were travelling at supersonic speeds and may there-
fore have been some sort of known aircraft.

Incident #19 -- Dayton, Ohio -- 20 October 1947

Information given here is insufficient to exclude posi-

of time in sight is not stated nor the speed estimated, it is impos-
sible to draw any definite conclusions. Assuming these to be appro-
priate, if one were to stretch the description to its very limits and
make allowances for the errors of an untrained observer, one could say
that the "cigar-like disks" might have been an illusion caused by rapid
motion and that the bright sunlight might have made both the objects
and the trails nearly invisible.

This investigator does not prefer that interpretation, and it
should be resorted to only if all other possible explanations fail.
In short, while it is not out of the realm of possibility that the ob-
jects seen were an unusual double fireball, it is most unlikely.

As in Incident #18, while it is impossible to rule out
the meteoric explanation (e.g., straight course, fast speed), the
lack of information about trail, length of time in sight, manner of
disappearance, and distance from observer, make any attempt at a
definite interpretation rather futile.

Again, in short, it is not impossible that the object seen 
was a daylight, slow-moving bolide, but it is highly improbable,
judging from the limited information offered.

Incident: #23 - Boise, Idaho -- 30 June 1947

It seems extraordinarily probable that the object observed 
in this incident was a combination sun-cloud effect. The altitude
of the sun was 30°, azimuth 230°. At that time of the afternoon,
the sun’s position was such that it could easily have illuminated
a background cloud which was perhaps almost entirely covered by a
foreground cloud. (Boise weather reports indicate an entirely
clear sky, but the report of the incident itself states that the
object "seemed to be clinging to a huge cloud.") This investigator
himself has observed such effects.

Incident #24 - weiser, Idaho -- 12 June 1947

There is nothing in the description of this incident that is 
Fatal to the hypothesis that the objects observed were parts of a 
"Double Fireball," but any such identification must remain uncertain.

The most convincing element favoring this meteors hypothesis 
is the persistent train. Fireballs occasionally leave trains that per-
sist for over an hour.

As far as trajectory is concerned, this is in agreement with 
that to be expected from a meteor on its way out from the sun (it having
gone toward the sun several weeks previously and now being on its return
journey toward outer space). Such a fireball would travel relatively rela-
tively slowly, and could appear to "Shoot out from the sun" and to travel
in a southeasterly direction.

The absence of bright flare and of noise is not unusual, since
reported daylight meteors are frequently not luminous (but do leave a
trail), and often no noise is heard.

Nor is the fact that there were two such objects fatal to the
hypothesis. The objects could easily have been single and have broken
in two, either in its journey around the sun or upon entering the earth's 
atmosphere. There have been several cases of objects that were single
on their trip toward the sun and double on the way out. Since comets and
meteors are closely related as far as structure is concerned, this double
feature is entirely possible.

Any probable astronomical explanation for this incident
is dependent upon the hour of observation, which is not stated in
the information given with the summary.

An unconfirmed statement (by Dr. Archam, quoted in material
submitted relative to incident #101) that this observation was made
at 3:30 P. M. allows for no possible astronomical explanation other
than that a persistent meteor train may have been observed. Such a
phenomenon might have given the general impression suggested by the
limited description of the incident.

If, however, the observation occurred during the early
evening hours, shortly after sunset, which occurred that day at
about 9:00 P. M. local time, then it is extremely likely that Lt. Gov.
Whitehead saw either the planet Saturn or Mercury. Mercury set al-
most exactly an hour after the sun and was of stellar magnitude +1.
Saturn, of magnitude 0.0 and hence about once again as bright as
Mercury, set two hours after the sun. A bright planet shining through
thin cirrus clouds could give the impression of a "rocket-like object."

SUMMARY

While there are approximately 375 incidents on record, only incidents Nos. 1 thru 244 are encompassed in this report. Of the later incidents, many have not yet been investigated, few have been completely tabulated, and none have been submitted to the consulting agencies. It is certain that better overall results will be obtained in the analysis of the later reports, as these incidents generally have been more completely investigated.

Since 5 December 1948, a series of recurring phenomena described as "green fireballs" have been reported in the general vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Dr. Lincoln La Paz, noted meteoritic expert, has been directly, though unofficially, associated with the investigation of those sightings and has himself observed the phenomena. Dr. La Paz states he is convinced the green fireballs are not ordinary meteors. This group of incidents has little or nothing in common with other incidents on file with Project "Grudge", therefore, these incidents are not considered in this report. The School of Advanced Communications asked to investigate this matter and had advised that an independent investigation be conducted in the field of atmospheric research.

Upon eliminating several additional incidents due to vagueness and duplication, there remain 228 incidents which are considered in this report. Thirty of these could not be explained, because there was found to be insufficient evidence on which to base a conclusion.

Consulting agencies provided plausible solutions for 164 incidents, along with the following comments and findings:

Rand Inc. — (172 Incidents considered) "We have found nothing which would seriously controvert simple rational explanations of the various phenomena in terms of balloons, conventional aircrafts, planets, meteors, bits of paper, optical illusions, practical jokers, psychopathological reporters, and the like."

Ohio State University (Dr. Hynek - 24 Incidents considered)
Assuming evidences of observers and investigators to be correct, Dr. Hynek concluded that 33% could be explained astronomically, 35% could be attributed to balloons, aircraft, rockets, birds, etc., and 33% either lacked necessary evidence or a suitable explanation was not apparent. Hence disallowance was made for inaccuracies in observing and reporting, 53% might be explained astronomically.

Air Weather Service (233 Incidents considered)

12.0% apparently were weather balloons.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #20, cas – Lockbourne AFB, Columbus, Ohio -- 7 January 1948

Considering this incident with #32, 35, and 43, one is forced to conclude that the object observed from Lockbourne Army Air Base on the evening of 7 January 1948 was the planet Venus.

One report of the incident gives the location of the object as 240°, or approximately opposite from that stated by other observers and that of Venus. Obviously, since the time of observation was the same, this means that one witness either was looking at a different object or had his directions mixed. Since the description otherwise agrees generally with the rest, and since it is assumed throughout the reports that all observers were viewing the same object, the latter interpretation seems preferable.

Witnesses state the object "couldn't have been a star" (of course, it wasn't), because the sky was completely overcast. However, reports from the Columbus weather bureau indicate that, although the afternoon was cloudy, the sky was clear by 1900 hours. (This does not mean, of course, that there were no clouds near the western horizon.)

For possible explanations of the "fasties" reported by observers of this object, and further discussion of the incident, see report on #33.

Incident #33, et. – Godman Field, Fort Knox, Kentucky -- 7 January 1948
(a discussion of all incidents reported for this date

Incidents #30, 32, 33, and #3 all occurred on 7 January 1948,
with #33 involving the death of Lieutenant Mantell. Battalion attention
has therefore been given to any possible astronomical body or phenomenon
which might serve to identify the object or objects observed. The four
incidents are considered together here.

Although the several reports differ considerably in regard to
the bearing and motion of the object (assuming for the moment that the
afternoon and evening sightings refer to the same phenomenon), they are
generally consistent concerning its timing, manner, and place of its dis-
appearance over the horizon. Hour and azimuth are given as 1505 CST,
about 220°, by observers at Godman Field; 1635 EST, west southwest, by
those at Lockbourne Air Base; and 1655-2000 EST, about 210°, by those
at Clinton County Air Base, (there are, as is to be expected, slight
differences in individual reports). Using this or the focal point of
attack, one notes immediately that all these times and azimuths agree
closely with the time and place of the setting of Venus. Furthermore,
all accounts except one agree that the object was low in the southwest
before the time of disappearance. Reports vary as to details of its
motion, but the overall motion was southwest and then over the horizon.

These facts taken together preclude any question of coincidence. Fur-
thermore, simultaneous observation from scattered locations proves that
the object had no noticeable parallax, or, in short, that it was a very
great distance away. All other statements concerning the object must,

it seems to this investigator, be weighed in terms of the overwhelming evidence of the manner of disappearance over the horizon.

The stellar magnitude of Venus on January 7 was -3.7, which makes it 16 times brighter than the brightest star Arcturus. Venus, when as bright as this and sinking through interstices in a host of clouds, could very easily give the effect of a flaring object with a tail. Concomitantly, the erratic motion reported by some witnesses, ties up the said motion of clouds past the object could give the illusion of rapid movement, as when clouds scud by the moon, or this effect could have been a psychological illusion; a third possibility, remote but based on a real-observed phenomenon, is that, owing to thermal inversions in the atmosphere, stars near the horizon have been known to jump about erratically through arcs of two or three times the moon's apparent diameter. Venus, when very close to the horizon, has been known to twinkle brilliantly with rapidly changing colors.

It appears to the present investigator, in summing up the evidence presented, that we are forced to the conclusion that the object observed in the early evening hours of January 7, 1953, at these widely separated localities, was the planet Venus. To assume that a terrestrial object could be located so high as to be visible simultaneously over a wide area, could be of such intrinsic brightness (of incredible brightness, far surpassing any known earth-made light), and would so placed essentially at the very position of Venus in the sky over an

interval of more than half an hour would be incredulous.
    
    Incident #33 is the only one of the four that includes
the daytime observation of presumably, the same object. The im-
portance of the incidents is, however, paramount, for it was in
tracking down the mysterious object that Lieutenant Mantell lost
his life. Again it is possible that the object observed was the
planet Venus, although the evidence is by no means as definitive
as that for the sighting made later that day. First, the bearings
of the object as reported by various witnesses differ considerably;
where one says southwest, another says south, for example. Stat-
...covery, interpreting all the evidence, one sees a faint streak within the
coincidence of the object's position with that of Venus. The fol-
lowing short table of sightings vs the position of Venus shows the
general agreement of the two in azimuth:

    A more pertinent question is that of whether it would have
been possible to see Venus in the daytime on that day. All that can
be said here is that it was not impossible to see the planet under
those conditions. It is well known that when Venus is at its greatest
brilliancy, it is possible to see it during the daylight when one knows
exactly where to look, but on January 7, 1948 Venus was less than half

too was the 'planet' Venus. In the absence of exact measures, however, it is impossible to establish t at it was or was not. (It is un- fortunate that theodolite measures of the afternoon observations were evidently not made.)

It has been unofficially reported that the object was a Navy cosmic ray balloon. - If this can be established, it is to be preferred as an explanation. However, if one accepts the assumption that reports from various other locations in the state refer to the same object, any such device must have been a good many miles if -- 25 to 50 -- in order to have been seen clearly; almost simultaneously, from places 175 miles apart.

It is entirely possible, of course, that the first sighting were of some sort of balloon or aircraft, b t that when these reports came to be seen - ided, a careful scrutiny of the sky revealed Venus, and it could be t at Lieutenant mantell did actually fly - chase to the planet, even though whatever object had been the source of the excitement elsewhere ad disappeared. At the altitudes that the pilot reached, Venus would have been very much more easily observed than from the ground, and it might even be that he did not actually pick it up until he was at a considerable altitude. The one piece of evidence that leads t is investigator to believe that at the time of Lieutenant mantell's death he was actually trying to reach Venus is

that the object appeared essentially stationary (or moving steadily
away from him) and that no cloud not seem to gain on it.

In summing up, this can be said: the evening sightings
reported in incidents #31, 32, 33, and 43 were undoubtedly of the
planet venus. Again, the daylight sightings from Godman Field
and other places in Kentucky, there seems so far to be no single
explanation that does not rely greatly on coincidences. If all reports
were of a single object, in the knowledge of this investigator no
man-made object could have been large enough and far enough away for
the approximately simultaneous sightings. It is most unlikely, how-
ever, that so many separate persons should at that time have observed
on Venus in the daylight sky. It seems, therefore, much more probable
that more than one object was involved: the sightings might have
included two or more balloons (or aircraft), or they might have in-
cluded both Venus (in the fatal cases) and balloons. For reasons
given above, the latter explanation seems more likely. Until a hypothe-
sis does, however, still necessitate the inclusion of at least two
objects other than Venus, and it certainly is coincidental that so
many people would have chosen this one day to be confused (to the
extent of reporting the matter) by normal airborne objects. There
remains one possible, very plausible explanation for this fact, how-
ever was the original report by any chance broadcast by local
radio stations? If so, with the general public on the alert, even

the onrushing aircraft might suddenly have appeared to be crashing
celestial objects.

In any event, since it seems possible that at the time
of Lieutenant Mantell's death, he was actually diving, chase to
Venus (and since, certainly, during the event...s...t...e...s, persons
assumedly well acquainted with outbursts of it in sky were alarmed by
the appearance of the planet), it might be wise to give information
about this incident wide circulation among Air Force personnel, so
that tragic mistakes will not occur in the future.

Air Material Command Aero-Medical Laboratory (Dr. Paul M. Fitts -
212 Incidents considered)

There are sufficient psychological explanations for the reports of unidentified flying objects to provide plausible explanations for reports not otherwise explainable. These errors in identifying real stimuli result chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance, and size.

All of the remaining 34 incidents are treated in detail in this report. These incidents form no pattern in regard to area of sightings, type of object, or manner of performance. There are indications, however, that some sightings were influenced by earlier reports, and probably would not have been considered unusual or reported had there been no publicity.

Incident #35 – off coast of Oregon – 12 November 1947

The information given here is too meager for a definite
conclusion to be drawn concerning the identity of the objects ob-
served. It is probable, however, that they were two parts of a
meteor that had broken upon entrance into the earth's atmosphere.
The length of time in sight is unduly long, but one wonders whether
this might not have been grossly overestimated for psychological
reasons. Otherwise, the scanty description favors the meteoric hypo-
thesis.

It is extremely unlikely that those objects were meteors, although their speed would argue for such interpretation. Had they been, however, one would expect much more brilliant light, a trail, and perhaps even detonation. Furthermore, their flight in formation argues against their being meteors.

The meager description suggests a light phenomenon rather than material objects. Was any auroral activity reported in the region at the time? The description answers more closely to a detached auroral streamer than to anything else, but this explanation is perhaps also far fetched.

Incident #40 — Phoenix, Arizona — 7 July 1947

No astronomical explanation seems possible for the unusual
object cited in this incident.

This case is especially important because of the photographic
evidences and because of the similarity of these photographs to the
drawings by Kenneth Arnold (Incident #17). The two incidents are sepa-
rated by slightly more than two weeks, and, of course, they occurred
in different localities. It is, however, perhaps more than coincidence
that these two best-attested, entirely independent cases should agree
so closely concerning the shape of the object and its maneuverability.

The present Investigator would like to suggest that this in-
cident, #40, being one of the most crucial in the history of these
objects, be reopened for investigation. The actual camera used by Mr.
Rhodes should be examined, and the original negatives preserved. Since,
from the size of the image on the photograph, we can have an accurate
estimate of the angle subtended by the object, this, in connection with
what appears to be a fairly reliable estimate of the distance, can give
us an estimate of the forces and accelerations involved in the tra-
jectory described by Mr. Rhodes. (It is unfortunate that a competent
investigator was not dispatched at once to “reenact the crime” with
Mr. Rhodes and to obtain sketches of the trajectory, etc., before de-
tails faded from his memory.) It would be important to know at what

his two exposures and the approximate time interval between exposures.
Physical data like these are absolutely essential if we are to get
anywhere in any basic physical explanation of these incidents.

There remains the strong possibility that the entire in-
cident is spurious, and the invention of an excitable mind. This 
strong,tinis the need for reinvestigatior if spurious, this fact
should be highlighted and even publicised, to quench enthuisiasm
for the irresponsible reporting of "saucers" and like objects.

CONCLUSIONS

1. Evaluation of reports of unidentified flying objects to date 
demonstrates that these flying objects constitute no direct threat to
the national security of the United States.

2. Reports of unidentified flying objects are the result of:

    a. Misinterpretation of various conventional objects.
    
    b. A mild form of mass hysteria or "war nerves".
    
    c. Individuals who fabricates such reports to perpetrate a 
    hoax or to seek publicity.
    
    d. Psychopathological persons.

3. Planned releases of unusual aerial objects coupled with the 
release of related psychological propaganda could cause mass hysteria.

    a. Employment of these methods by or against an enemy would
    yield similar results.

weight could be given to it. As it is, with flying saucer talk rampant,
almost anything from meteors to balloons or aircraft would be reported
as saucers by an uncritical observer. It is unlikely, however, that
there was anything astronomical about this incident.

The object was in sight too long to be a meteor, and the variable "reflection" and absence of any statement about trail also argue against that interpretation. It is difficult; however, to rule out the hypothesis completely, because of the lack of pertinent information and the ever-present possibility that the reporting was more subjective than objective.
