AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Sighting of an Unidentified Aerial Object, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

19 October 1950

Prepared by: Percy Y. Sutton, Captain, USAF

a. At approximately 2152 CST, 18 September 1950, an unidentified aerial object was observed over the vicinity of Tinker AFB, Oklahoma. The object was sighted by 1 Sgt Randall D. Fowler of the Intelligence Section of the 513th Reconnaissance Squadron.

b. When first sighted, the aerial object appeared to be at a position of approximately 300 to 400 feet, moving in a north and northwest direction at a speed estimated to be from 300 to 400 mph. In appearance the object resembled an elongated area of luminosity with indistinct definition.

c. As the object passed directly above the observer, in its northwesterly flight, there appeared to be jerky sideward movements. The object was observed for approximately 10,000 feet continuing in the northwest direction.

d. Clear skies up to 25,000 feet were reported at the time of the observation.

A check of local air installations on the following morning revealed that no local aircraft were known to be aloft at the time of the observation.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Unidentified Airborne Objects (Circular in Shape)

SUMMARY: Object was sighted at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on 20 September 1950. Sighted by Major S. A. Slaw, Mr. Group Intelligence Officer.

THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS MADE BY S/SGT.
assigned to the 509th Bomb Squadron of the 509th Bomb Group, Medium, Walker Air Force Base, Roswell, New Mexico:

"At approximately 2100 hours on 20 September 1950 while on Guard Duty on the east side of the 509th Bomb Group Area, I observed a bright white light appear about 500 feet south east of the base perimeter. It seemed to be at an altitude of approximately (100) feet, and covered a distance of approximately (300) yards in about 2 to 3 seconds. I called the attention of Corporal and Private First Class to the object, and they also observed the same. The object then disappeared from view. At approximately two (2) miles northwest of the base the object seemed merely to disappear. The following morning Corporal and Private First Class listed airman also saw the same object at the same time."

A check with Base Operations revealed that there were no aircraft in the local area at this time.

A check with the Base Weather Station revealed that the ceiling was twenty-three thousand (23,000) feet and that visibility was fifteen (15) miles.

The early warning radar Station, this Base, was inoperative at the time of this observation.
