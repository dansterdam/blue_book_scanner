The image does not contain a photograph; it is a scan of a handwritten note. Here is the transcription of the document text:

at first was a burning airplane,
it was gliding like a plane ready
to land.
I sat spellbound for fully a 
minute staring at this flaming
object when all at once it vanished.
my husband did not see it as I
did not want to take his attention
from the wheel, when the object
vanished, then I told him what I 
had seen, and wondered if someone 
else had seen that thing in the sky,
a few days later I talked with a 
person who had seen it,
to me it looked like the framework
of something burning.
