SUBJECT: LIGHTS OBSERVED IN SKY 

1. On 6 October 1965, at approximately 2330 hours, the undersigned was on patrol in a car on the North boundary of Edwards Air Force Base, California, when he observed several lights in the sky to the north of his location.

2. The lights appeared to be stationary and were located approximately 400 yards north of the North boundary of the base. The lights appeared to be approximately 300-400 feet in the air. The lights were whitish in color and varied in intensity.

3. The undersigned watched the lights for approximately 5 minutes. During this time the lights dimmed and brightened independently of each other. The lights then extinguished simultaneously.

4. The undersigned was unable to determine the source or nature of the lights. No sound was heard associated with the lights. There was no cloud cover and the sky was clear.

5. The undersigned notified the Air Force Police Control Center of the incident at approximately 2340 hours. An Air Force Investigator from the 6510th Organizational Maintenance Squadron was dispatched to the scene to investigate.

6. The Air Force Investigator was unable to determine the source or nature of the lights. No other witnesses were located.

The text does not mention any photograph in the image. The key information provided in the text is a detailed description of the lights observed in the sky, including their location, color, intensity, and behavior over time.
