Mackay, North Queensland, 4:35 P.M., 15th May, 1953.
Captain E.L.Jones, an R.A.A.F. pilot, reported by radio that he saw a plane, just south of the city at 6,000 ft., which he reported to CIVIL AVIATION DEPARTMENT. Captain Jones observed the object circling and appeared a grayish-brown in color. It was moving at a high rate of speed and disappeared. This happened on May 10.

To check with the control tower at the airport showed that there were no other aircraft in the air at the time. The report showed that there was a dark circular object which was traveling at a high rate of speed and then vanished. From about 1,000 or 3000 ft. the terrific rate until it vanished crossed his path again near Freshwater Point.

Captain Jones said that he and his second pilot had watched the object about five minutes. There was no possibility, he added, (during the course of a radio broadcast) that it could have been a meteorite. He said the object exhibited no vapor or sparks.

Aripbane, May 18:
A meteorological officer, while plotting the course of a balloon with a theodolite, sighted a bright crescent shaped object in the morning sky. It appeared to be moving in a southerly direction. It was observed for about 15 minutes and with the naked eye. It gave the observers the impression that it was suspended in space and reflecting the early morning sunlight.

Melbourne, MAY 19, 1953
A group of people at Surrey Hills yesterday reported seeing a bright object in the sky. It appeared to be 100 ft. long. The sun shone brilliantly off the object, which was visible for about 4 minutes. A telescope could not be obtained quickly at the time, so the opportunity to examine the object more closely was lost. Several people in the group reported that the object appeared to be circular like a ring or the objects that fly about it.

About 8-45 AM 5/4/55 I, W.H. Sullivan, Indiana, was driving and I saw sitting on the barb wire fence a bright silver object...it appeared to be round and a trifle larger than a basketball. It was shaped like a plate tilted at an angle and gave off a very bright shiny gleam as if sunlight was reflecting off it...it hovered about one minute and then "took off" at a tremendous speed straight up into the sky and disappeared from sight.

METEORS

The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers in studying meteors, their appearance, and their disappearance as accurate as possible, either by bending and curvature or by relation to fixed stars, or both. Movements of trails and their direction of drift are of especial importance, as they determine wind direction in the upper atmosphere.

NORTH ATLANTIC
Mr. C. M. Torpersen observed the American SS. Marion Lykes, CASE: W. Childers, 1952-05-24, at 07:57, G.M.T., in lat. 27°27' N., lon. 71°87' W. -- a bright blue-green meteor was observed near the star 20b23. The meteor dropped out in fan shape, and disappeared in an intense flaring and flash after traversing 15° arc.
