8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Parties in vehicle observed a "mushball" blue, red, yellow and white object, no trails, moving in an arc from east to west at high speed. The object appeared to be from 2 to 3 times the size of the baseball. It was observed for 3 seconds, during which time it traveled about 10 miles. The object was very bright and appeared to give off light. There was no noise or trail associated with the object.
9. COMMENTS
Sighting was of 5 min. Report came from 13 miles east of Fairview, North Dakota. Several persons in the car observed the object, but none could determine its exact size. Since it was a very bright object and moved rapidly, it would be difficult to establish exact size and distance.
