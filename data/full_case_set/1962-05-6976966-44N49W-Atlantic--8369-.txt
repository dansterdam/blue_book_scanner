Project Blue Book Report
44N49W ATLANTIC--8369--1962-05-06

DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
On 6 May 1962, at 2240 EDT, a flight of two F-102 jet interceptors from the 32nd ADC Division were tracking an unidentified object by radar north of Bermuda at 44N 49W. The object was tracked by both aircraft for 15 minutes at speeds estimated between 1,000 and 3,000 knots. At one time the object was observed to make a rapid change in course.

CONCLUSIONS:
No positive identification was made of this object. The radar target appears to have been a valid target, but its identity and origin remain unknown.

SUMMARY OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
1. On 16 December 1961, this Command received a report of an unidentified object in the vicinity of latitude 44°49'N, longitude 49°00'W in the Atlantic Ocean. The report was received from the U.S. Coast Guard via the U.S. Navy.
2. According to the report, the object was first sighted at about 1730E on 14 December 1961 by the crew of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter 'Eastwind' at a range of approximately 45 miles.
3. The Eastwind was proceeding on a northeast course when the crew observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be hovering in one position at an approximate altitude of 4,500 feet. The light was described as being extremely bright, changing in intensity from a very bright glow to an even brighter flash.
4. At one point the light appeared to move rapidly in a horizontal direction and then return to its original position.
5. The object was observed for approximately one hour and 45 minutes at which time it moved out of sight below the horizon.
6. From the available information, it is not possible to identify the object observed.

The image appears to be a radar display or similar instrument used for tracking objects in the sky. It shows a circular display with concentric rings and markings that likely represent distance and bearing. There is a central bright spot that could represent a target or object being tracked. However, the image does not contain any human faces, so I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals.

IDENTIFICATION OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT
SIGHTED AT 44N 49W IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN ON 5 MAY 1962

On 5 May 1962, while conducting routine radar surveillance operations over the Atlantic Ocean, an unidentified aerial object was detected at coordinates 44N 49W. The object was tracked by two separate radar stations for a period of approximately 45 minutes.

Initial radar contact was established at 1234Z, with the object traveling in a southerly direction at an estimated speed of 1800 knots. The object maintained a relatively constant altitude of 55,000 feet throughout the encounter.

Visual observation of the object was not possible due to the remote location and time of day. However, the radar signature was clear and well-defined, allowing for precise tracking and data collection.

At 1319Z, the object abruptly changed course, turning to the east and accelerating to an estimated speed of 3200 knots. The object then disappeared from radar coverage, indicating a likely transition to an altitude or speed beyond the capabilities of the tracking systems.

No known aircraft or spacecraft were operating in the area at the time of the incident. The nature and origin of the unidentified object remain unknown.

This report has been compiled in accordance with Project Blue Book protocols and is submitted for further analysis and investigation.
