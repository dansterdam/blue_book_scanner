PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE-TIME GROUP: 21 Oct. 66  21/0520Z
2. LOCATION: Patchogue, Long Island, New York
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2 hours plus
6. OBSERVATION: Ground Visual 8X
7. COURSE: Stationary
8. PHOTOS: E Yes F No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: F Yes E No
10. CONCLUSION: Astro (Sirius)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched a light in the SE that was flashing red. The object was seen just the flashing lights. There was very slow movement noted by the witnesses. Once the object disappeared, the object was first observed at the horizon, the SE and it was still there two hours later. It then went into a vertical motion, straight up, and this motion took about 10-15 seconds. The duration of the sighting was about 2 hours. The sighting raises out such an explanation. The object, according to the witness, was low on the horizon and from the area should have been quite visible. Kennedy and Randle did not actually report any unusual appearance or activity to substantiate the report that he could see the same object the next night. He called back and said that he had seen Sirius and it was just like what he had seen.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a typed document from the Dearborn Observatory at Northwestern University dated October 27, 1966. The document discusses a sighting of the star Sirius on Long Island, New York on October 26, 1966. It was reported by a detective and describes the object as appearing very much like Sirius, but that it was probably the object seen rather than Sirius itself. The document is signed by J. Allen Hynek.

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY 
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 60201

27 October 1966

I spoke with Detective *** of the 5th Precinct on 26 October relative to the publicized Long Island sighting. From his general description and position in the sky it appears that this might have been an illusion in getting up at 2 a.m. the following morning and locate Sirius and compare the star with the reported sighting. He did so, calling back on 27 October to report that the star Sirius was just about in the same place and looked very much like the object which he reported. He concluded that probably the object and seen Sirius but he couldn't be positively sure but it was probably what he saw.

In my own mind this clinches the matter but because of adverse publicity in the past it would be wise to withhold release until we have had a chance to examine the reported photographs.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

At 1509 hours, 21 Oct 66, Major Quintanilla spoke with Al Hein, of Westbury, Long Island, New York. We had a UFO sighting early this morning. A couple of patrolman observed object. I am just trying to get the procedures that are followed. A patrolman spotted the thing in the sky. Sgt and another, all saw it and they in turns reported it to Westhampton AFB. The Air Force people made a check of their own radar installations and FAA radar installations and came up negative and that they would not give their information on to Wright-Patterson. Once we get it we will see what the characteristics are, Major told him. If it looked like an aircraft then we check into aircraft. If it has other characteristics we check into the others. I don't know what they saw so I don't know what I am going to be looking into. Mr Heis said that a photographer took a long lens shot of it. The photo showed a large round and not saucer shaped object. Like a full moon but not fully outline. Seemed to have some type of lights, different colors, and was passage shape. One person who observed the object works for Grumman s/c and was a former navigator and he thought it to be 3 - 4,000 ft alt. Very bright, bigger than a star. He saw an amber light flashing and travelling fast. Noting in an arc. Looked like a tennis ball. Didn't look like any aircraft he had ever observed. The police kept tabs at 0113 and was still in the general location at 0510. Mr. Heis said he has a number of other calls that other people saw it. This thing could be from an advertising firm that had balloons stolen. This place was vandalized and balloons went up over the weekend. They were being filled with lights. Major Quintanilla.

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the image:

told him that Laser people had been doing some work on the East coast.
But he couldn't say what object was because he hadn't read and heard
all on the report. He had heard that a number of people were working
with lasers. We would have to do a lot of checking. There are a
number of possibilities. Four hours seems awful long for a balloon. 
We will have to get the weather data and if the winds are wrong then
it will shoot the theory. Mr. Heis called Brookhaven Lab and they
were not sending up any balloons. Major told him that when this
type of person sends up balloons they usually go up during the
daytime. Cambridge launches balloons. Though, I haven't had a
balloon that will stay in the area that long. The guy who had
the balloons stolen said they were very light with batteries and
are 3ft. That's a pretty small balloon.
Major told him that he would certainly like to have the negative of
the photo that was taken. New York daily News has it. I could have
to blow it up so we could see what we have got. Once we run out of
leads that's it. Major told him the case sounds interesting, have to
check many things before I can say what it is. Hollaps Island has
been the culprit in some cases lately. Ft. Churchill has been doing
some work out they are too far North.
Mr. Heis then asked questions about the University of Colorado and
if they would investigate the sighting. The problem is that they are
just getting set up a new and once they get settled they will start
investigating. We work with the base. We are a monitoring base.
If we have to make further calls we usually can make them from here.

Like checking with Cambridge and others we can usually do it from here. If we can not explain it we can't explain it. Can't say anything about it. There has been so much publicity, Mr. Heis said, that the police commissionar is intervieving them to make sure they were not drinking. We usually get calls after there is publicity. Mr. Heis said that one of their fellows interviewed the policeman. The patrolman saw it at 5:10 am, and said he knew it wasn't a star and it was very high up. It moved up and to the south, one time very bright then it would dim. He said it moved in a southerly direction. Photographer said it was hard to distinguish between a star, first moved at 7 - 10 deg angle, later at a 45 deg angle. Wanted to know what Major thought about it now. Major said since I/( don't have the information I can't say. I would have to take a look at all the information. I will have to check the weather data. The weather was very clear that night and their were strong breezes on the surface and they let up as the night went on. Wanted to know how soon our office would received the report. Major Quintanilla informed him it would take at least 72 hours before we would get it.
