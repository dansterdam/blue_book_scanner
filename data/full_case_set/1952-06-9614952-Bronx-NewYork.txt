Text from the document:

On 27 June 1952, Mrs. [REDACTED], of the Public Information Office, Telephone Retd 29786, extension 280, that her husband, two children and a neighbor had seen a flying saucer. Conclusions that the object was stimulated by the neighbor's experience, said she had seen a flying saucer.

Capt. Nausman was contacted and gave a brief description of the incident. Mrs. Coppenheimer was contacted and gave the following description:

While on the roof of her apartment building early Friday morning, June 27, Mrs. [REDACTED] observed a round, disc-shaped object hovering in the direction of Lagardner Airport. It shot then stood up and zoomed 85 at terrific speed toward downtown Manhattan. It was a thick object, silver gray, and about the size of the target range.

When the object disappeared.
