The image contains a photograph of a page from what appears to be a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The page includes a "SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE" form, which contains various questions about the observer's sighting of the unidentified phenomenon. The form includes a sketch or diagram for the observer to indicate the appearance and location of the observed phenomenon.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE

In Control Tower, looking East.

- page 3 -

The image appears to contain two illustrations. The top illustration is a compass-like diagram with labeled directions (NW, N, NE, etc.). The text above this diagram instructs the viewer to imagine they are at the center of the compass rose and to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when last seen.

The bottom illustration appears to show a landscape view from a central tower or vantage point, with two smaller inset views on the right side.

As an OCR system, the text extracted from the document is:

SA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN " X " ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A SKETCH IN THE MARGIN TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN " X " AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A " Y " AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE X AND Y WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE APPARENT PATH OF THE OBJECT. IF THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
