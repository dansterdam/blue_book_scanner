Transcription:

24. Date you completed this questionnaire: 3 april 1963

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Flying objects appeared in the sky about 8:15 p.m. on the night of February 13, 1963. There were about 6 objects in a triangular formation. They were moving in a southwest to northeast direction and were in sight for about 2 minutes. They appeared to be elliptical in shape and white in color with a pulsating glow. The objects were larger than a normal aircraft and moved in an erratic manner, making sharp turns. They appeared to have a bluish or green colored exhaust or flame coming from the rear as they moved along. They disappeared from sight rapidly and gave no indication of the source or destination. I felt they were not aircraft, experimental rockets, or other known objects. They may have been some type of unidentified flying objects.

April 6, 1963, [redacted]

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 23 April 63

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific police questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The object which we observed appeared to be triangular in shape. It was dark in color, seemed very large in size. The object was hovering at an estimated altitude of 5100 feet and maintaing a constant heading - No apparent means of propulsion could be observed.

We had no way of estimating the true size of this object. It seemed very massive and was observed for a period of 7 to 10 minutes. While maintaining constant heading and altitude, it suddenly accelerated to a tremendous velocity and disappeared from sight over the horizon.

I suggest that this incident be given further investigation. It is my belief that the object observed was not a conventional aircraft, but an Unidentified Flying Object of unusual design and performance characteristics. I do not have an explanation for what we observed that night. I can only state the facts as they appeared to us. I hope this information will be of assistance in your investigation of this sighting.
