AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PACE 2 OF 9

I. SOURCE:
Address: Mira Loma, California.
Age: 25 yrs.
Occupation: Raiffleman in a canning factory and odd shift ground observer.
Education: Completed High School and a Radio-Electronics Course in a Technical School.
Qualifications: Member of the Ground Observer Corps.

II. RELIABILITY: The reliability of this source is evaluated to be good as he has a background of military training and understanding of speed and distance concepts as an ex-member of the Ground Observer Corps. Nothing in his statements was judged to be unreliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source was on duty at the Glen Avon Airport, Mira Loma, California, on 30 June 1955. The night was dark, dry and clear, with many stars visible. At approximately 2005 hrs, he observed in the western sky about 30 degrees above the horizon a bright light which was moving rapidly from east to west at an elevation of about 35 degrees. The object appeared to be a true light, as it did not flicker or change shape. It moved with a steady velocity and disappeared from view after about five seconds. The object did not appear to make any erratic movements, nor change shape or flicker.

B. The object appeared to be solid and did not move; behind anything but source was not sure if it moved in front of anything. The source insisted that he could see the earth's flat contour and distinguish the objects elevation against that of the horizon. (Source was wearing glasses).

C. Source's opinion of object's size ranged from that of a quarter to that of a quarter-dollar. It continued its course at the same elevation throughout its brief period of visibility. This elevation was maintained during the complete sighting.

The source stated that at one time before he had witnessed a similar sighting, but was fairly certain this was not a star. He advised that the object was definitely not a satellite, as it was not a star.

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

While looking in a southeasterly direction, I saw an object which appeared to be a meteor, but in the thirty-five (35) seconds of which it was observed, it traveled on a horizontal plane. I considered this a reported this to the Filter Center, Pasadena, California (WERE 5709) immediately. This white object seemed to have a slight tail which while traveling changed colors from white to orange to a formidable green in less than a minute. The object disappeared in the extreme southwest.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
AF FORM 112--PART II APPROVED: 1 JUNE 1955

1. A contact with 6th Weather Group, Pt-7, Norton AFB, San Bernardino, California, reported the following information:

a. A temperature inversion of five (5) degrees Centigrade existed at this time between the altitudes of 1500 feet and 1700 feet. The temperature at 1700 feet was 1.2 degrees C higher than at 1500 feet.

b. Winds aloft are are indicated below:

ALTITUDE WIND DIRECTION WIND SPEED
(IN FEET) (DEGREES) (KTS)
15,000 270 16
20,000 275 23
25,000 280 30
30,000 290 40
35,000 310 45
40,000 310 50
45,000 320 45

2. Dr. RONALD G. CARPENTER, Professor of Astronomy, San Bernardino Valley College, was contacted on the possibility of making observations in the Hollywood and Riverside areas. He stated that the weather conditions since 2300 hrs, 6 July 55 were such that the possibility of sightings such objects would be highly improbable. There were indications that the three reported sightings in questions were probably caused by the weather phenomena described in paragraph 1 above.

3. GEORGE STAHLERT, Professor of Astronomy, San Bernardino Valley College, was also consulted concerning this sighting. He concurred with the analysis and conclusions reached by Dr. Carpenter, and reliable in all phases of investigations with this exception--he was of the opinion that the duration of these sightings and the high degree of maneuvering reported precludes the possibility of any weather phenomena being the cause.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
7132 AISS 
10 JUL 53
PART TWO

COMMENTS ON THE PREPARING OFFICER:
1. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the reliability of the information contained in this report is considered good. The sources of the information can be made about any one of the three sightings because there were only slight variations in location.
2. The following possibilities are given: Fighting ships, weather balloons, and reflection of the observers' faces in the windshield or possibly mirages. (Further comments are made below).
3. This report shows a file entry of seven degrees temperature inversion did exist, which is the normal condition for the area and time of year. This could have a bearing on the sightings and adds to the theory of an optical phenomenon.
4. The report shows that the sightings were of short duration and could be satisfactorily explained by the length of time during which a meteorological phenomenon would be visible, leading to the possibility that these sightings were as a result of a meteorological condition.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
1. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the three (3) sightings described above are separate and distinct sightings, with conclusions of each as follows:
a. Riverside, California: Sighting by Ernest L. Dunn, Glen Avon Ground Observer Post.
b. Arlington, California: Sighting by Larry C. Spears, Arlington Ground Observer Post.
c. Hollywood, California: Sighting by Albert DeLong, Hollywood Ground Observer Post.
