Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s)

Notes: This officer while interviewing this subject was much impressed by his
attitude. While it appeared to embarrass the subject considerable by telling
such a story with this thought that people would think he was crazy, never the
less he felt it was his duty to report it to proper authorities.
This subject appeared to be of average or above average intelligence, spoke
with good vocabulary and seemed to be of sound charactor.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

   I was enroute from Bellefontaine to Lima, O. Saturday June 11, 1949 about 5:20PM
over route 33 and 117. When about 1 mile South of Huntsville, Ohio I noticed an
object in the air and it seemed to be six diving directly at the highway in front of
me and I looked out my right side mirror. I pulled the car to the side of the high-
way very quickly. I observed an oblong polished glass with my hands on and a little
better look. I observed an object a;/rooaring from high in front of me directly
to my right at what appeared to be a terrific speed. The object dove directly a
toward the highway and when about 1000 feet above the ground it turned to its
right and hugged north and west. When approaching head on it appeared to be
oval in shape with small short objects protruding from the lower half, much like
the appearance of a Sea Seri (See Diagram No. 1) Filppers.
When making its turn it appeared to be more of a square turn and not like an
airplane. It's actions could best be described th that it looked like a puppet on
a string with someone guiding same.
At this object made its bank or turn to the right it's form took of the shape of
being perfectly round or oval with a terrific, blinding light shining from it.
It possibly was the sun's reflection. I was wearing polaroid glasses at the time.
It then headed straight away from me to the North west at a very high rate of
speed and took the shape of a perpindicular line. (See Diagram)
As the craft was approaching me I looked about me to see if there was anyone
else about to see it. There was no one working in the fields nor anyone that I
could stop on the highway. I looked for any smoke, flames or sound but there was
none. I checked the area after the craft had left for any sound from nearby
tractors, trains etc. which might have covered any it may have made but there
was none. I proceeded into Hunstville and stopped at the filling station and asked
if the men there if they had heard an airplane go over head and they answered
negative. I then went on home and told my wife and no one else until this officer
appeared today.

The image contains a handwritten document. There is a diagram drawn in the lower half of the page of what appears to be the flight path of an object. The path seems to include straight lines with changes in direction indicated by arrows.

Here is the text from the document:

Lima, Ohio                                        July 18, 1949

Dear Sir:-

(12) I was about a mile south of Huntsville
Ohio. This object was the distance of two
city blocks ahead of me, about two hundred
feet from the earth.

(13) Direction of flight, (Diagram)

(15) Object traveled so fast I had no way of
checking time. not sure two minutes for
the whole flight as diagrammed. I thought at
first it would hit my car. I stopped my truck
and jumped out just as object started it
horiz(ontal flight. It was only a few seconds
in horizontal and upward flight out of my
sight.

There are no photographs present in this imageâ€”just handwritten text. Here is the transcription of the text in the document:

---
Lima, Ohio

(16) There was no sound or odor, after object
traveled out of sight I drove to Huntsville & and
ask some men who were setting out in yard
if they had heard an airplane or similar sound
just before I drove up. They had not heard any
sound of any kind, I didn't tell them what
I saw.

(17) There was nothing 
moving
(18) unable to indicate exhaust or vapor coming 
from this object

(18) Its color was of a very high degree of
brilliance. like a very highly polished mirror

(19) There was projection on each side. as object
was moving upward flight. they are hard to describe,
looked like very short fins. Such as a exal
bar on front of its body,

(20) object seemed to be under perfect control and
flew just an diagram indicated. (no diagram(13))
direction of flight.

(21) as object started it upward flight it seemed
to become a thin line about the width of your
hand and disappeared very quickly and complete,

(22) There were a few white clouds in the west sky but none in line of travel of this object.

(23) The air was moving from a south west direction just enough air moving to be noticeable.

(24) Weather conditions were fair and the sun was very bright at this time,

Lima O,

I am employed by The Standard Oil Co of Ohio in the Fuel Oil Dept, Lima Division, at Lima, Ohio. This object is very hard to describe because of the short length of time to see it and also its speed. Its coming so close to the earth and being so close to it is why I reported its state Highway patrol officer . However my wife and I saw a similar object about 3 weeks before, but at a great distance

UNCENSIFIED
