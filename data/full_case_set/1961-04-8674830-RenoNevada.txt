10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Object observed directly overhead moving W to E yellow-ish. Observed directly overhead moving W to E so bright it obscured the stars. Described as looking like a star with a tail. Faded out at 30 degrees.

11. COMMENTS
Comments are typical of sightings of this type. It is possible that the State Police could have been informed in a more prompt manner to observe the object as it was moving. No other observers at the local ranches are known to have been in a position to observe the object.
