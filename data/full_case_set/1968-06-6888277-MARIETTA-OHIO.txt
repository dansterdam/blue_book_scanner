MARIETTA, OHIO 
JULY 27, 1968

WRIGHT PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE
Dear Sir:

I am going to tell about a U.F.O. I saw. It was last night when I saw a red light, it soon came closer, it was a disc-shaped craft with a dome on it. Then it went out of the glow out of the corner of the gone. It Minor changed course and went to Cherts. It soon flew out of sight by way of the Big Dipper. The light I sighted was 4500.

Do you have any explanation for this?

Very truly yours,
[Redacted]

The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch is a compass rose that appears to be used to indicate the direction of a UFO sighting. The smaller sketches depict a person standing in a landscape, likely intended to illustrate the perspective of the observer during the UFO sighting.

Now, as an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)

19. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THESE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO SHOW THE APPARENT DIRECTION OF MOTION. THE LARGER SKETCH SHOULD BE USED TO ILLUSTRATE AND EXPLAIN THE SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS PORTION OF THE REPORT.

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram rather than a photograph. The diagram shows a circular shape with different colored regions labeled "Yellow", "Red", and "Yellow" again. There is additional text below the diagram that asks about the angular size of the object and instructs the viewer to "hold a match at arm's length in front of a known object, such as a street lamp or the moon" to determine how much of the object is covered by the head of the match.

AFR 80-17(C1)
15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON, INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS VIEWED OR PHOTOGRAPHED, AND INDICATE CLEARLY ON WHAT TRAILS INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. HOW WOULD YOU HAVE COMPARED THIS ANGULAR SIZE TO THAT OF THE MOON OR OTHER KNOWN OBJECTS IN THE SKY AT THE TIME?
