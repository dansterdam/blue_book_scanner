The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the top right corner of the document. The sketch appears to be a side-profile view of a saucer-shaped object.

Dear Sir(s),
At 2:15 and 3:00 pm we witnessed unidentified objects in the air. There were three objects flying from northwest to southeast, and at 3:04 two objects came from southwest. The objects were moving at a variable speed and traversing the clouds at a variable way. It was difficult to determine the size, but a telescoping lens is called a constant lens. The latest theory is a missile from the clouds.

Yours truly,
[Redacted]

The image contains a detailed sketch or diagram, but no actual photograph. The sketch appears to be an illustration related to UFO sightings or observations, including a compass-like diagram and instructions for the observer to draw the motion of the object(s) and how they were arranged.

TRANSCRIPT:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you last saw the object.

30°
60°
75°
90°

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

OBJECT STARTED MOVING SLOWLY, THEN ACCELERATED TO APPARENT SPEED AND WENT OUT OF SIGHT IN DISTANCE. 

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
