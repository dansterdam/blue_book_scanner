Dear Sir:

November 14, 1958

At that time a member of our organization discovered the pictures. 
We were told to not put the pictures on display or try to sell them. 
We have done this and held the pictures in our possession. We find
that our pictures have a story behind them that might be of interest to
the director of U.P.O. in Newark, N.J. do not know the legal standing as it was not signed by a major, written by a major. 
It does not mention anything as far as I can determine. 
It does not say anything about any witnesses that have some pictures and I know theyhave some pictures and I know they have some other information.
Our pictures was taken them and I assume they will give them to me.

I am not sure where Col hand told me he got them from some Newark Advocate.
First I had been explain about the pictures Col told me he used to have one but it was lost in the crash. To bring the truth to the public of everything and anything that is seen in this way.
They felt that this government agent in man picture and tell all.
Stating how the Club was being handled and what a fantastic
organization this man has had on the subject.
without our knowledge. Mr. husband and son like to use them on display and I immediately contacted the owner of the
pictures and removed them from the that display when I explained to him
the circumstances under which I obtained. So these are pictures
that he returned them and gave them to me. I have tried to
talk with this editor of newspaper and he tells me that something was obtained by some method he does not know from the file and
this was obtained from what I know as I was all the person disclosed by the director U.P.O.C., as far as I can find
and the Air Force came to Newark and looked at the pictures. I have
tried to tell Mr. what he can do about him let us know just what
big thing I do not know what to pictures were and possibly they were
Organization that does show on public show. that it would be
the man that is a member of U.P.O.A.P. has claims that they will fear his
arrest is a tried to explain that the organization in worse than UFORs
but the boy is told all the way this he must bring the truth to the people.
I would rather my son would be looking through a telescope than running around with a gang of hoodlums there is a mine watch of boys in this club out

I am making no excuses for the matter I have received in referring to a club that does not exist. The other boys have not seen through him yet and he has some of them thinking that those men in his plane are something else.

He has called into my house so often that I was about to forget I was a Mother and a lady. I think I have the telephone calls stopped.

The pictures Major is sending to UFOC, and I know to be of USAF, this may have to do with some of another family here and I intend to have a talk with him. 

so far. I have tried to stop him but since he isn't of age, I can only go so far. (I was thinking of a good spanking.)

If you care to look into this matter further, his name, address, and telephone number is listed below:

Mr. 
Newark, Ohio

I talked to a gentleman from O.S.I. and also one from O.I.S. and I was told to write this letter and explain what had happened.  If this letter is not clear, I will answer all questions that I can.

Executive Officer,
Civil Information Division
Operations Research Service
Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

Last year the Executive Officer very kindly, in reply to a request from me for information about certain flying saucers, sent us a considerable amount of useful information, which can be used in the activities of the Astronomical Society.

During the past year or so a large number of fireball have appeared over the eastern or middle western states, and in the cause of the five to be mentioned, I have been able to assemble a number of observations. This despite the fact that it is extremely difficult to make good records of them, I am therefore writing to request that you be good enough to send me copies of any or all reports in your hands dealing with these bodies.

I may add the Astrophysic Office of the U.S.Navy has for over 30 years effectively cooperated with us on scientific matters, and it has been possible to solve for many important problems. Such cooperation from your office, and a routine matter, would also be appreciated.

The specific bodies I now request information on are:

1958 April 26/21 Southeastern States
1958 July 4/5 North Carolina etc.
1958 Oct. 30 North Carolina etc.
1958 Dec. 12/14 New York, New Jersey etc.  
1959 Feb. 10/11 South Carolina etc.

It would be a great favor to me and useful to science if
you would be good enough to send me observations dealing with these fireballs.

Very sincerely yours,

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

AUGUST 14, 1959

1. In answer to a request by Dr. Olivi'er, the following information is submitted:

a. 29 April 1959, 2219 hrs - Two observers at 9000 feet altitude, located at 65 degrees 5C'N and 85 degrees 12'W degrees (over Baffin Island). They observed a bright white light, trailing a fiery tail, apparently moving at a very high speed from northwest to southeast. The light came to within about 30 miles of the observers, then slowed and appeared to hover for two seconds. It then accelerated and disappeared in a descending curve.

b. 5 July 1959, 0102 hrs - At 71 degrees 30'N and 74 degrees 25'W (over the Davis Strait), two observers in an aircraft chserved an object which was visible for approximately 15 minutes. It appeared as a bright, steady white light, and was observed to make a slight change in direction, increase in speed, and gain altitude. The object then appeared to split into two parts, one of which continued on the same course, and the other part reversed direction and disappeared.

c. 14 December 1959. No location given. Two observers reported seeing a brilliant bluish-white object in the sky, which appeared to increase in size and luminosity as it approached, and then diminished in size and luminosity as it moved away toward the southwest. Duration of sighting was reported.

d. 1 December 1959. No location given. Two observers reported seeing a bright light which appeared to maneuver and then disappear. No further details were provided.

The image contains a map or diagram depicting the planet Mars and its position relative to the Earth. The map includes various symbols and labels indicating the positions and brightness of stars in the night sky. There is no photograph present in this image.

MARS NEAR AND BRIGHT
The red planet Mars will come closest to the earth in November. This will be its closest approach until 1971. It is in the constellation of Aquarius and will be visible throughout the night. 
By JAMES STOKLEY

The planet Mars is now over 150 million miles from the earth. On Nov. 16 it will be only about 35 million miles away, its closest to the earth since 1941. It is in the constellation of Aquarius, and will be visible throughout the night, rising soon after sunset.

According to the accompanying map, Mars will shine very brightly in the southwest during the early evening hours, and will reach its highest point in the sky around midnight. It will appear much brighter than any of the stars, and will be easily visible to the naked eye.

The best time to observe Mars during this period will be on Nov. 16 and 17. This is when the planet will be closest to the earth and will appear largest through a telescope. After this date, Mars will gradually become more distant and less bright.

The map also shows the positions and relative brightness of various stars in the night sky. Symbols are used to indicate the order of brightness of the stars, with the brightest stars marked with the letter "A".

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned page from an old Project Blue Book document. The text on the page appears to be a description of life on Mars and a celestial time table for November.

Life on Mars
One of the most interesting was the work of Dr. William M. Sinton of Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona. Dr. Sinton found that Martian soil contains certain carbon and hydrogen compounds, but he cautions against over-interpretations, as these compounds may have been produced by processes going on currently or may have been in the soil for long periods. Dr. Sinton measured the infrared spectrum of the Martian atmosphere and found it to contain such simple gases as carbon dioxide and perhaps also molecular oxygen, but other trace constituents were not identified.

Celestial Time Table for November
The time table lists various astronomical events and observations for the month of November.

Big Green Flash
Light: Brilliant

This document appears to describe some kind of sighting, possibly of a "big green flash" or "light: brilliant" event. However, without any additional contextual information, I cannot provide any further details or analysis about the content.
