PAGE 2 OF 5 PAGES

At approximately 2130, 7 February, 1953, a visual sighting of an object was called upon to aid in the identification. The object was described as round, white in color, approximately 30 feet in diameter and moving at a fairly high rate of speed at an estimated altitude of 3,000 feet. The object was observed for several minutes. 

The control tower operator, an officer, stated that the radar had picked up an object which corresponded to the visual sighting. Several other persons, including military and civilian observers, also viewed the object through the 7 by 50 power binoculars. 

When first seen by the naked eye it was rapidly changing color, varying from white to green and occasionally to red. No sound was heard and the object made no sharp turns or other erratic maneuvers. It was concluded that the object did not move with respect to the stars.

Motor could not be started and no aircraft were seen in the area. It was the personal belief that the object did not move with respect to the stars.
