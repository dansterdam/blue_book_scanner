The image appears to contain a compass illustration and some instructions, but no photograph. The text states:

"27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" to show the same curved line to indicate the position of the object when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling."

The text appears to be instructions from a document related to the investigation of UFO sightings, likely from Project Blue Book.

Transcription:

At the time I saw the object, it appeared to be about 6:00 p.m. or a little later.
It was quite dark and the object itself was illuminated, but the area around it was dark.
The object appeared to be elliptical in shape, very bright and glowing, about the size of a basketball at arm's length. 
It was silent and had no obvious means of propulsion. It was moving at a steady rate of speed, possibly 500-800 mph.
Its course was straight and level. It was no sound at all. An it looked to be about 1000-1500 feet in altitude.
The object was visible for about 25-30 seconds. As I watched, it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and was gone.
That is about all I can recall at this time. There were no other witnesses that I know of. I was the only one who saw the object.

The image contains a photograph that appears to be a technical diagram or schematic. The diagram shows various shapes and geometric patterns, including a central circular element and what looks like waveform-like lines. There is also some text that appears to be technical labels or annotations, but I cannot make out the specific content due to the low resolution of the image.

As per the OCR instructions, here is the text output from the document:
