THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE
BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS

SUBJECT: REPORT ON U. F. 0. DATA SIGHTING - BOYDTON, VIRGINIA

TO: GEORGE F. CONLON
BOYDTON, VIRGINIA

RE: YOUR LETTER OF 29 JANUARY 1962

YOUR REPORT OF THE UFO SIGHTING ON 7 JANUARY 1962 HAS BEEN RECEIVED AND REVIEWED BY THIS COMMITTEE. THE DETAILS OF THE SIGHTING AS DESCRIBED IN YOUR LETTER APPEAR TO BE OF SIGNIFICANT INTEREST TO US, AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE TIME TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION.

BASED ON THE DATA FURNISHED, IT APPEARS THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED WAS PROBABLY OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORIGIN. HOWEVER, FURTHER INVESTIGATION WOULD BE NECESSARY TO CONFIRM THIS CONCLUSION. IF YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR EVIDENCE THAT COULD ASSIST IN OUR ANALYSIS, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO FORWARD IT TO US.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION IN THIS MATTER. WE WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH YOU SHOULD WE REQUIRE ANY CLARIFICATION OR HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.

SINCERELY,
THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE

The image contains a compass rose diagram and two landscape drawings. The compass rose diagram appears to be used to indicate the direction of an observed phenomenon. The two landscape drawings depict a person standing in a landscape, though the details are not clear enough to identify any individuals.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON AS FIRST SEEN. CONNECT THE X WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON AS DESCRIBED.

 1. DATE/TIME GP:  6 January 1969, 2010 EST
 2. LOCATION: Boydton, Virginia
 3. DURATION:  5 minutes
 4. USAF UNITS INVESTIGATING:  6547th Radar Sqdn, Langley AFB, Va.
 5. ACT ION TAKEN:  Radar, visual investigation by military personnel.
 6. BRIEF SUMMARY:  Witnesses saw an object hovering in the sky that appeared to be 15-20 feet in diameter. The object suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.  While no physical evidence was found, the radar indicated an unknown target was present in the area at the time of the sighting.
 7. ANALYSIS:  The radar returns and visual sighting lend credence to the report, although the lack of physical evidence and the inability to track the object on radar after initial detection make this a difficult case to evaluate conclusively.  The object's sudden acceleration and disappearance indicate possible unconventional flight characteristics. Without additional data, the possibility that this represents an unknown aerial phenomenon cannot be ruled out.
 8. CONCLUSION:  Unidentified

Memo for record
Subject: Report of 3 Feb 69
On 3 Feb 69, at approximately 2030 Lebanon Pike, Centerville, Ohio, Mr. W. B. observed an object that he estimated to be between 1930 and 2030 hours. The object was described as being about 30 ft in diameter, 8 ft deep and almost straight down. At 2045 hours the hole could have been caused by a meteorite. 
Mr. J...R. Y... notified me above and asked about possibility of satellite decay producing a hole 8 ft deep. Mr. E...F... in turn notified Lt. McDowell. Lt. McDowell called Mr. E...F... and they discussed this being produced by a meteorite. Dr. McClosky said it was possible but improbable. Possible only a small piece of a meteorite. Mr. Gitron said I should call him back the next day. (Mr. Gitron suggested testing with a magnetometer nine evenings or even a request on a stick.)

Possible meteor impact of 30 January 1969 near Centerville, Ohio

Mr Robert Citron
Center for Short Lived Phenomenon
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
60 Garden St Camoridge, Massachusetts 02138

Dear Mr Citron:

1. On the evening of 30 January 1969, between 7:30 and 8:30 PM EST, the observer found a hole in his back yard that is about 4 inches in diameter and about 7 feet deep. This hole had not been there the day before. He considered this office because he thought that the hole might have been caused by a meteorite. 

2. The observer's name and address is:
[redacted]

If you decide to contact the observer, please contact Lt Marano at this office also.

3. We would appreciate any comments you would care to make on the possibility of a meteorite causing this hole.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES JAN. 13-19, 1969

The Surface weather Map presents the locations of high and low pressure systems, cold and warm fronts, and other pertinent meteorological data. The plotted stations show the wind direction and speed, the temperature, and the type and amount of precipitation as indicated by recognized symbols. The map covers the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. EST. The isobar spacing of 4 millibars shows the intensity of the systems and the general circulation pattern.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the contour patterns and the current departures from normal temperatures at the 500-millibar level, which is located approximately 18,000 feet above sea level. The contours show the position and intensity of the major upper-air features. Temperatures shown on the chart are departures from normal. The heights of the contours and the temperature pattern indicate the general circulation pattern.

The Prognostic Charts indicate the expected location and intensity of high and low pressure systems, fronts, and precipitation areas for the 24 hours ending at 7:00 a.m. EST the following day. The 500-millibar Prognostic Chart indicates the expected pattern at the 500-millibar level.

Bulk copies may also be ordered at a cost of $2.30 per 50 copies. Checks should be made payable to the Superintendent of Documents.
The Surface Weather Map presents the station data and the analysis of the 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined low pressure areas are indicated by heavy dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.
The highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.
The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete totals are underlined. "T" indicates a trace of precipitation.
