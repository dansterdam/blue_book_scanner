BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING The object resembling a large star or planet, was observed over Kansas City, Kansas, where it made a rapid transition over a distance of several thousand feet from view to the west horizon to a position approximately 45 degrees elevation in the northeast quadrant of the sky. It then hovered and pulsated for several minutes and apparently moved off to the northwest, disappearing from sight. The object was estimated to be approximately 3,000 feet over Kansas City. It was observed by several people. In addition there were several ground radar observations of a target in the area, corroborating the visual sightings.
