The document contains two black and white illustrations, not photographs.

The top illustration is a compass rose with directional markers such as N for North, NE for Northeast, etc. There are two letters marked on the compass: "A" is placed somewhere between the W (West) and NW (Northwest) directional markers, and "B" is located between E (East) and ENE (East-Northeast).

The bottom illustration is separated into two parts:

Left Sketch: It depicts a side view of a landscape with a person standing in the foreground, looking towards a horizon where the sky meets a stretch of land or hills. The sky is clear, and there's nothing else depicted in the sky.

Right Sketch: It shows the same side view, but this smaller illustration has two letters "A" and "B" connected by a dotted line to indicate the movement of an object from point A to point B across the sky.
