Dear Sir,

I would like to obtain a copy of the new Air Force booklet "Aids to Identification of Flying Objects." The reason for this request is because of my constant observation which is still by me to this day, of the years of 1958-1959 in mid-summer. My father as doctor was making a house call. I # staying in the car waiting for him as it was getting quite bored and hot, decided to put my head out of the car and look at the heavens. I'm doing this. I noted an object which was moving at a fair pace. At first I thought it might be a private plane because it was circling quite close. It was no plane because it had no motor with lights. All that was on it was a huge florescent green mass of light. It was circling very slow for a good 45 minutes. It made no noise whatsoever. It had a green effect, thinking of it as it was circling down on me - like the "effects" of Tromas radiation a lot no off.

```
This sort of whip effect. It puzzled me because it was as high as 2 telephone poles yet made no noise what so ever. Strange still was its inability to shed any light. It was just a mass of green flourescent green, which light.

I would like to know what this might have been. In my opinion I do not believe it was a so called flying saucer. It didn't add bad. It just acted strange matter. It just _________.
_________, _________.

Please send me an explanation; I simply was absolutely clear. This happened at the time I lived in Tampa, Florida.

P.S. Since then I have no flying saucers look to me or it might be something far important; I believe not. What is amusing part still is that it makes no noise.

Thank you again.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)                 10 Jun 1958
                                                           Marysville, Calif

                      Source: Flying Saucers - Oct '59

Fargo, North Dakota Newspaper
SMOKING SAUCERS
Marysville, Calif, (AP) A brilliant light traveling slowly north-
east past Marysville and emitting a smoke trail was reported by a
dozen listeners to radio station KMYC Monday night (February 16,
1959). The object was sighted at 6:00 P.M. Viewers said it disap-
peared into a cloudbank after two minutes.

Believe the above is the same type plane seen by me June 10, 1958 at
about 3:50 P.M. It seemed to rise near a clump of trees growing along
side a stream, and just south of the small mountain range called The
Buttes. It was a clear day. I imagine it was not more than 10 or 15 feet
in the air when I first spotted it. It was gaining altitude rapidly and
headed in a southwesterly direction. It traveled close to the ceiling at an
exceptionally high rate of speed. Shortly after I first saw it, it was
between me and the sun and I could see the outline of a cigar-shaped ob-
ject about 150 feet in length, enveloped in a cloud of smoke from nose
to tail. It looked like a giant cocoon hurtling through the sky. Watched
object from moving taxi for about 20 minutes. Phoned C.A.A. at Its of-
fice at Yuba Co. (California) Air-
port. Cab driver saw it also.

Unidentified
Object in Sky
Strikes Home

Claude Williams of Glen Arden, Md. complains vehemently that a blue whistled object, which descended out of the blue Wednesday and ripped a three foot hole in the metal porch awning of his home.
Williams said he hadn't the foggiest notion what the object was and when Prince George's County police, firemen and Andrews Air Force men

Base investigators finished and scratched prowling around the home they hadn't any idea either.
Capt. Jack Shea and Lieut. Carl W. Peterson of the Air Force, reported they had completed their investigation, found nothing, and had no theories.
Williams, of 8106 McClain Ave., told police that something made a whistling sound, zipped through the ground and a tree about 50 feet away. Williams, his daughter, Rose; son David, 12, and a playmate, were home at the time.

Here is the text from the document:

---
We checked the sky for airplanes that
there were none.

I have no explanation for this incident,
but I do know I saw this object and
my mother is sure, too. The reason we didn't
report it was because we didn't believe in
UFO's then and it wasn't very popular then.
The reason I am writing now is because I am
beginning to believe in them more and more now.

I am not writing this as a prank and I
hope this report can bring us to some
understanding.
Sincerely,

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

All I remember is that it was night, in the summer of 1953, we were arriving home from my grandparents who lived in Chicago. It was 10:30 because we always got home at 10:30 every time we went to Chicago. There were absolutely no lights in the sky or for that matter anywhere around. The nearest house around then was about a block away. The lights in our house were out because we had not reached the house yet. My mother and I got out of our car and in the full moon we saw at tremendous lights, the shape of a circle. We observed it for about 10 seconds and then turned on the car for a very small amount of time to kind of tell my dad. But when we looked over, where we saw it, it was gone.

No Case Information Only 29 Jun 1958

Explorer III Died
Quietly, Perhaps

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 29-
(UPI) — American satellite Ex-
plorer III apparently died on or
short of schedule with no re-
ported fireworks, experts at
Smithsonian Astrophysical Ob-
servatory said today.

A top official said there had
been no confirmed sighting of
Explorer III since 10:30 p.m. Fri-
day at Memphis, Tenn., where
the artificial moon appeared on
schedule. Astrophysicists here
and at other agencies had pre-
dicted Explorer III would burn up
in the earth's atmosphere by to-
night.

Smithsonian authorities dis-
counted reported sightings since
Friday night in Connecticut, Ar-
izona and over the Atlantic ocean,
saying old, worn, Explorer III would
have passed over the southern
half of the United States at vary-
ing times last night.

No Case (Information Only)                                              29 June 1958

                                      HIGH NEWS SCENES

PILOT SEES UFO SPLIT INTO THREE PARTS. Captain Peter Jurowel of
the Royal Dutch Airline attested on June 29th that he saw a "glaring light" dis-
integrate into three parts, while flying to New York City from Shannon, Ire-
land, the previous night. "We spotted the light two hours out of Shannon while
flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet. "The light became brighter and crossed
our path in a low arc," he related. "The moon was right up there too, so we
could compare the illumination with the moon. It started bright as Venus and
at one time appeared brighter than the moon. Then it suddenly burst into three
parts, each part still very bright. Two seconds later the parts either burned
out or being lost in the clouds beneath us."

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for May 24, 1958

ASTRONOMY

Saturn and Jupiter Visible

Three bright stars now seen in the eastern sky will become even more prominent in upcoming months. June 21 marks official beginning of summer in Northern Hemisphere.

By JAMES STOKLEY

BRILLIANT JUPITER, to the south, and Saturn, conspicuous although it is less than a sixth as bright, are two of the principal objects seen in the June evening sky. Both of these planets are shown on the accompanying maps, which depict the heavens as they stand about 10:00 p.m., your own kind of look above time (add one hour for daylight saving time) at the first of June, or an hour earlier at the middle of the month.

The stars are made background against which the man-made earth satellites can be seen as they flash briefly along their ways, Jupiter is in the constellation of Virgo, the virgin, and just across the brightest stars in that group, Spica. On the astronomical brightness scale, Spica is classed as a maenial 0.92, but Jupiter is now minus 1.8, which is about 12 times as bright. Saturn, in Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer, is of 1.2 magnitude brightness, with magnitude 0.2.

A little to the right of Saturn yours, we see Scorpius, the scorpion, with Antares, at its bright star that is distinctly red in color. And over in the west, to the right of Virgo and Scorpio, low in the northwest regions and Denebola, The twin, and Aruviga, parts of Gemini, are still visible. Pollux and the Chariot, first magnitude stars in these groups, appear much fainter because they are close to the horizon and there is so much absorption of their light by the earth's atmosphere.

Bright Stars in East

In the east you will find three bright stars that will become even more prominent during the coming months. These are Vega, in Lyra, the lyre; Deneb, in Cygnus and the Swan, which is just below Lyra; and Altair, in Aquila, the eagle, to the right of Cygnus.

Another name for the swan is the Northern Cross, which is now seen in a partially inverted position, for Deneb is at the head of the cross.

The Great Dipper, part of Ursa Major, the great bear, stands high in the northnext. Dubble and Mizar, the "pointer" stars in the bowl of the dipper, are below; if you follow them to the right, you come to Polaris, the pole star in Ursa Minor, the lesser bear. The dipper's handle forms a saundite to move through Aliazu ursa. If you allow its curve, placement stars, Mizar and Alkaid, toward the south, you come to brilliant Arcturus, in Bootes, continuing still farther, turning just to Scorpio and Jupiter.

In June, although Mercury is too close to the sun to be seen, Venus and Mars are visible later in the night. Mars comes up about three hours ahead of the sun. Its brightness is almost as much as that of Saturn, and its red color makes it easy to identify. It is now in Pisces, the fishes.

Venus, nearly five times as bright as Jupiter, is in Taurus, the bull, rising about two hours before the sun.

On June 21 for the sun will reach its fervent north position the sun will reach. This event, which marks the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere, is called the summer solstice. It occurs at 4:57 p.m., EST. At that moment the sun will be directly over a point in the Pacific Ocean, on the Tropic of Cancer, and some 500 miles north of Japan.

Jupiter's Motion Visible

With Jupiter so close to Spica, a star that occupies a fixed position in the sky, the movement of the planet is readily seen. If you have been watching it during recent months, you will have noticed that it has been moving westward among the stars since Feb. 15. This is called its "retrograde," or backward, movement. Actually Jupiter, like the earth and all the other planets, is going around the sun in the same direction, which is from the west to the east. But the nearer a planet is to the sun, the higher its speed. The earth's mean velocity in the orbit is 18.5 miles per second, compared with 8.1 mph for Jupiter.

Since February, both earth and Jupiter have been in about the same direction from the sun. With the earth's greater speed, it has pulled past the outer planet, however. Viewed against the background of distant stars, therefore, Jupiter has seemed to move backward, toward the west. In the same way, if you were traveling on an express train and pass a freight train on the next track, the slower freight train may seem to be going on the way, even though actually it is moving in the same direction that you are. On Feb. 15 the earth will have passed Jupiter. By June 19 it will begin to pull away and Jupiter will resume its usual, direct, celestial motion among the stars.

Astrology for the news goes Saturn, which is opposite the sun and close to the earth (899,000,000 miles away) on June 13. Secondly, it has moved back 15 points.

Saturn is also being sandwiched among the stars, whose traveling disk April 24 on Aug. 24 it will resume its direct or forward movement.

At this time of year we have the opportunity of catching a fleeting glimpse, in the evening sky, of a permanent constellation which can never be seen completely from most parts of the United States. This is Centaurus, the centaur.

A few of the northernmost stars in this constellation are shown on the map of the Assistant er.com

southern sky, just above the horizon. The rest of the group is far south that it fails to rise at all. The 5", "st" south you are, the higher these stars rise, and from southern Florida on June evenings, if it were perfectly clear right down to the southern horizon, you would see two very bright stars in the center, Alpha and Beta Centauri.

Sun's Closest Star

Alpha Centauri is famous because it is the sun's closest neighbor in space. Actually it is a double star, consisting of two separate orbs, revolving around a common center of gravity. They have a more distant and fainter companion, which may be a little closer than the bright pair. This is called Proxima.

The distance of the Alpha Centauri system is about 26 million million miles, or 4.3 light years. That is, their light, which travels 186,000 miles every second, takes that many years to reach us. It is, in a scale model, the period at the end of this sentence representing the sun, Alpha Centauri would be a space two miles away!

The centaur, it will be recalled, was a mythological creature with the head and shoulders of a man and the body and legs of a horse. This constellation, on the old star maps was shown holding a spear which he was using to defend himself from a wolf, represented by the constellation of Lupus, to the left of Centaurus.

The hind legs of the centaur are a very famous group of stars, for these make up the Southern Cross, the constellation Crux. Originally considered part of Centaurus, it is now listed separately. From southern Florida, and the vicinity of Brownsville, Texas, the Southern Cross just rises above the horizon; from Central and South America it comes well up into the sky, the Crux is directly south of Corvus, the crow, a constellation to the right of Spica and a little lower, which is shaped like a ship's mast.

Actually, as the Southern Cross is not as "bright" as our Northern Cross, Four good stars mark its extremities, but there is no star, as there is in its northern counterpart, to mark the intersection. To people who live in the southern countries, it is a symbol of their homeland, and the southern cross appears, on the flags of New Zealand and Australia.
