REPORTING AGENCY

Dear ___ and ____ UFOS;

This comment refers to the sighting of three objects seen by an unidentified individual on June 8, 1962 over Argentina.

The report describes that the objects were first seen by the witness at about 9:30 p.m. local time. They appeared to be spherical in shape and were surrounded by a glow or luminescent field. The objects were observed to be moving rapidly and silently through the sky.

The report provides additional details about the witness's observations, including the objects' behavior and movement patterns. It also mentions that the objects were photographed, but no photograph is included in this particular document.

The report concludes by stating that the case is being investigated further and that additional information may be forthcoming.

AIRGRAM

DEPARTMENT OF STATE

Washington, June 14, 1962.

SUBJECT: Report on Unidentified Flying Object from Argentina. G-33/635, June 14, 1962.

REPORTING your 1902 Montevideo telegram received in Buenos Aires concerning a report of an unidentified flying object seen over Argentina on June 8, 1962. The object was described as a bright light, round or oval in shape, moving rapidly from north to south, very high and disappearing in the south. Several persons, including some military personnel, reported observing the object. No sound was heard and no shape or structure could be made out. The object was observed for about 2 minutes.

This report is apparently the most recent in a series of sightings of unidentified objects over Argentina in recent years. The Embassy is forwarding details of these previous reports for your information. It is requested that the contents of this airgram be kept in strict confidence and not revealed to unauthorized persons. As you know, reports of this nature are extremely sensitive in Argentina and disclosure could cause considerable embarrassment to the national authorities and space activities. We would appreciate being advised of any additional information which may come to your attention.

[Argentina-may 1962]
A flying sauger landed on an isolated farm in the province of Buenos Aires. The saucer hovered a short distance above the ground and several small beings exited the object, which they then re-entered and took off.

[may 31-june 5, 1962] the Argentine Government, on may 31, officially reported that a "flying saucer" had been sighted by two businessmen, a rancher and his wife. The woman, who had a closer view, said two round people were in the object. An Argentine Air Force officer said experts confirmed that the object displayed the characteristics of a flying saucer.

THE A.P.R.O. BULLETIN
TUCSON, ARIZONA - MARCH, 1962

UFO PHOTOGRAPHED IN ARGENTINA
Cesar Domingo La Padula, Ariel Kaplan, and Raúl Narosky, students of astronomy and physics at the National Observatory of Córdoba, Argentina, reported that on July 29, 1961 they observed and photographed a "completely irregular" aerial object at about 5:50 p.m. during daylight hours. The object was described as not maintaining the typical circular-disc shape of flying saucers, but rather as an irregular, shifting shape. The newspaper "La Voz del Interior" published accounts of the sighting and the photographs, but says the original negatives were not given to them.
The article also mentions that the object had a "glowing upper side" and a shadow underneath it, and other details that make the whole incident quite interesting. However, the newspaper "Córdoba" said that members of the Institute dedicated to have the photographs analyzed were informed that the photographers who took them were not known.
There is a note stating "See Photos on page 3", but there are no photos included on this particular page.

AERO BULLETIN - Argentina - March... 1962 -

"A group of students of the Institute of Technicians, Ernesto Jose Ind, students of the Institute of Technicians, Observatory and Physics, claimed to have sighted a UFO while on the terrace of a building. According to witnesses, the object was observed for approximately 15-20 minutes, was "irregular" and that once it suddenly entered the clouds, supposedly because of "the high number of people in the building". No details are stated that the object left traces on the ground.  

The newspaper "La Prensa" published photos (although they were reported as not real) of some especial missions over our city, according to the newspaper "La Voz del Interior".  

Besides publishing on that occasion two of the photographs and comments about them, the object with the added comments that corroborating witnesses claimed to observe the object in the air. 

That is to say that the sighting and subsequent photograph was reported in the newspaper "La Prensa" in an interview with the photographer of the institute, who said he had taken photos, but according to the newspaper "La Voz del Interior" the photographs were not real. Professor Alberto Recin who said he gave no credence to the reports, and said he felt the incident was another example of a "vanilla hoax"). He also stated that the photographs that the object that appeared as a shadow on the upper side, the base of the object are noticeable and there are some peculiarities that make the whole suspicious. While denying the authenticity, the newspaper "Cordoba" said that members of the institute denied that the pictures were fakes.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for APRIL 28, 1962

ASTRONAV

Planet Venus Now Prominent

The planet Venus becomes increasingly prominent in the evening sky as 1962 progresses. Venus may be seen in the evening sky and Mercury has already begun to fade out. Even the moon, which at times may interfere with the view of Venus, is clearing the western sky.

At no time in the year 1962 is Venus more prominent than in May. It is a sight worth watching those evening when skies are clear and the air smooth. By May 1 Venus will have reached its maximum brilliance and will be conspicuous low in the northwest after sunset. Owing to its great distance it appears only as a bright star, but it is much brighter than any star in the sky and will be the first thing to catch the eye as it appears above the horizon. 

Most Prominent Stars
The most prominent stars of late April and May are Deneb, Vega, Arcturus, and Spica. High in the northern sky, the brilliant Vega, marking the foot of the Northern Cross, is also known as the "Harp." 

To the east, the brilliant star Arcturus appears, following the curve of the handle of the Big Dipper. The bright red star Antares of Scorpius, Leo's bright Regulus, Virgo's Spica, and, of course, the North Star Polaris, lie in this part of the sky.

Mercury can be seen at dawn setting low in the east, passing far under Venus which now predominates in the evening sky.

THE FIELDS
Space Agency Launches Satellites Program
A NEW PROGRAM has been announced which will involve the launching of 19 scientific satellites, primarily for the investigation of earth's radiation fields and atmospheric conditions, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory announced today.
The program will be carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in cooperation with the Naval Research Laboratory and the Atomic Energy Commission.
The program will be carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in cooperation with the Naval Research Laboratory and the Atomic Energy Commission.
The first satellite will be launched this summer and another will follow shortly thereafter. The satellites will be used to study the earth's radiation fields, atmospheric conditions, and solar radiations.
The satellites will be carried into orbit by Thor-Able launch vehicles, the Navy announced.
It is emphasized that the program is NOT a weather satellite program as has been suggested in some reports, but rather will be directed toward fundamental scientific investigations of the earth's radiation fields and atmospheric conditions.

Birth Rate of Small Stars...
Birth Rate of Small Stars Slower Than Long Age
THE BIRTH RATE of stars smaller than our sun is only about one-tenth that of larger stars, astronomers have found after an exhaustive study of stellar data. 
The conclusions are based on a statistical analysis of observations of the 1,000 nearest stars, made over a 50-year period. This study, made by Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper of the University of Chicago, of the U.S. Naval Observatory and Dr. Olin J. Eggen, of the Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories, California Institute of Technology, indicates that the birth rate of stars comparable in size to the sun or smaller is only about 10 per cent of that of the more massive and luminous stars.
This information is of crucial importance to theories of the origin and evolution of the universe.

Safety from Fallout Seen
For Breast-Fed Babies
SCIENTISTS HAVE NEW EVIDENCE that radioctive fallout is much less dangerous to breast-fed babies than to those fed from canned or powdered milk. (...)

Overall Cure Rate Now
One in Three for Cancer
LATEST STATISTICS show the overall cure rate for cancer has increased to about one in three, or 33 1/3 per cent, according to the American Cancer Society. 
This compares with a 25 per cent cure rate 10 years ago. 
The increased rate is attributed to earlier detection, new methods of treatment, and wider application of known effective treatments. 
However, an estimated 160,000 Americans will die from cancer this year, the society reports. 
Cancer is still second only to heart disease as the leading cause of death in the United States. 
During the past 10 years, the society says, research has led to the development of new techniques for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer.

Alaska Caribou Has High
Level of Radioactivity
RADIOACTIVITY IN CARIBOU from northern Alaska has been found to be 30 to 40 times higher than in caribou from other northern areas, the U.S. Public Health Service reported.
Caribou is a staple food of Alaskan natives and an important source of food and clothing for many residents of the state. Radioactive contamination of caribou meat is therefore of considerable concern.
The high radioactivity apparently results from fallout deposited on the lichens eaten by the caribou. The lichen apparently acts as a concentrator of radioactive materials.
Consumption of caribou meat by Alaskans could result in serious internal radiation exposure, the Public Health Service warned.

Photo analysis was requested for a print forwarded to PID via the Office of the Commanding General. The print displayed an object with a serrated outer edge. There are no other images or data pertaining to this document. The background is indistinct and appears to be mostly of a very dirty and heavily damaged negative and is an enlargement or unknown quality.

Considering these factors, it is felt that there is insufficient data available to allow for an attempt at any definitive analysis of the object.

Seattle--Another Fire Ball 
On May 8, 1962 at 0215 hours, residents in Seattle were startled by the sight of a huge yellow ball of fire streaking silently northward through the sky over that city. The object was estimated to have been about the size of a full moon and was described as casting a bright yellow-white light. According to the report, it moved very rapidly from the southwest to the northeast before disappearing. It was sighted again a few minutes later over Tacoma, Washington. It was reported to be approximately 35 to 40 miles north of Seattle when last observed. There was speculation that the sighting was connected with a similar incident which occurred several weeks earlier in which a bright object was seen over the Seattle, Tacoma, and Bremerton areas. 
The first sighting yesterday at Jupiter-Washington occurred. The object was observed to emit a series of flashes or pulses of light before diminishing and disappearing. The sighting was reported to local police and representatives of the U.S. Air Force. Witnesses in Cambridge, Mass. later confirmed that some sort of object had been sighted in the Seattle area shortly before noon on May 8, 1962.

NOT AN AIRPLANE OR METEOR!

AERIAL PHENOMENON VIEWED

DEFIANCE, OHIO - A certain family on the outskirts of Defiance, Ohio reported an unusual incident to the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization on May 23, 1962. The family consists of the parents and their three children. The father, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force, his wife, and their three children (two boys and one girl) observed an unidentified aerial object on the evening of May 20, 1962.

The object was first observed by the daughter, who was outside by herself. She called the rest of the family and they all went outside to observe the object. The object was described as being cigar-shaped and hovering low over a road near their home. The object was glowing with a brilliant light, which was not constant but varied in intensity. After about 5 minutes, the object moved rapidly away, changing to a brilliant white light before disappearing. The object was observed for about 10 minutes.

The investigating agency sent an official to interview the family, and he reported that they were obviously sincere in their report and that they clearly described what they had observed. The father was interviewed by officials from the nearby Defiance College, and his report was found to be consistent with the information given to the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization.

This incident is one of the many that have been reported to the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, which is a non-profit organization chartered in Washington, D.C. and composed of scientists and other qualified personnel who investigate reports of unidentified aerial objects.

Southern England - Wales

MAY 31 - A strange globe-shaped machine speeding over England at 8,000 ft. Capt. Gordon Pendleton, former Royal Air Force pilot, stated he sighted the UFO's tracked under his plane at a distance of about 6 miles. He said "it was quite clear," he stated. "It was oval-shaped, with a bright white light in the center and a pulsating bluish-green hue about its periphery. It gave off no exhaust or vapor trail, and paced his plane for about 20 minutes at an indicated airspeed of about 600 mph."

Pendleton called the Cotswold Airport control tower but the object disappeared from both sight and radar. The tower confirmed the sighting. Pendleton's description to Flt Lt Murphey confirmed the captain's account.

Air Ministry are investigating.

TWO AF LINGUIST PILOTS DIE SOONER
THE LOLLIPOPITES LANDED GRIRiiN, 'i'HEY TOLD THEIR UFO EXPERIENCE --- The two linguist pilots were on a rouiine flight from Buenos Aires, Argentina to Montevideo, Uruguay. They were at about 25,000 ft when they first noticed a bright light off to the north. As they watched, the light grew larger and brighter until they could make out the shape of a metallic, disc-shaped object. The object was much larger than their own aircraft and was traveling at an incredible speed. Suddenly, it made a sharp 90 degree turn and raced away at unbelievable velocity. The pilots were amazed and puzzled by what they had seen. Their report was filed with Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official UFO investigation organization. The significance of this incident lies in the fact that the pilots were highly trained and experienced, and yet they could not explain what they had observed. Their testimony lends credence to the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena.

New Space Riddle
MARCH,APRIL,MAY, '62. SPACEMEN GALORE. Watcher on the Threshold" --------"After the Wave -- a Dark Silence"
(Condensed from the FLYING SAUCER REVIEW)
"Something new and strange has been happening. Through the fog of controversy and confusion, a new pattern of UFO reports appears to be emerging. We seem to be on the threshold of a new phase in the UFO phenomenon. 
Flying saucer activity during the months of March, April and May, 1962, was on a scale unprecedented in recent years. The number and variety of reports from all parts of the world suggest that we may be witnessing the beginnings of a new "wave" of UFO activity.
In the midst of this new upsurge, however, there has been a curious silence from certain quarters where the phenomenon has been most persistently observed and studied. The official observatory at Moonheim, West Germany, which has for years been a major source of sighting reports and photographs, has suddenly gone silent.

La observacion de este fenomeno ha sido una experiencia extranisima para mi. Hasta el momento presente no he podido darmeca cuenta de su verdadera naturaleza. En lo que respecta a los apuntes que hice entonces, puedo decir que los considero de total veracidad, pues los hice en el momento mismo en que se desarrollaba el fenomeno.

La forma que tenia este objeto era la de un paralelogramo alargado, de color blanco lavado y al parecer brillante. Volaba en direccion sur-norte a una altura aproximada de 300 a 400 metros. Su desplazamiento no era uniforme sino con pequenos saltos bruscos, con periodos de aceleracion y frenada. La velocidad de desplazamiento era variable, estimo que oscilaba entre 150 y 300 km/h.

En ciertos momentos tenia la impresion de que el objeto se fijaba en un punto y luego continuaba su rumbo. Hice varios intentos de tomar fotografias del mismo pero sin exito, ya que en el momento en que iba a accionar el obturador, el objeto desaparecia de improviso, reapareciendo a los pocos segundos en otro lugar.

La observacion duro aproximadamente 10 minutos, desapareciendo el objeto finalmente hacia el sur, alejandose a gran velocidad. Este fenomeno me dejo sumamente impresionado y sorprendido, por cuanto no he podido hallar, hasta la fecha, una explicacion racional del mismo.

ARGENTINA 1962
A massive UFO visitation
by Gordon W. Creighton

1962 was a year of remarkable UFO activity over the Argentine Republic; in fact, some have described the events as "sensational and unparalleled." Hundreds of UFO sightings were reported, particularly during June 1962, at Mar del Plata, Presidente Peron, and other places.

On January 19, 1962, at 4.45 a.m. a flight of 20 to 25 UFOs was seen over the Atlantic by the crew of a ship off the coast of Mar del Plata. They witnessed the UFOs for some 20 minutes. One of them was reported to have hovered directly over the ship.

On June 9, 1962, an enormous UFO was sighted over the town of Cordoba. It was egg-shaped, some 300 feet in diameter, and surrounded by a glowing orange light. It was observed for 20 minutes by hundreds of people.

The events of June 17, 1962 were described as "the most important sighting of the year" in Argentina. At 8.30 p.m. on that date, a large circular object, surrounded by a bright orange light and giving off colored rays, was sighted by thousands of people at Mar del Plata. It hovered for some time over the city and then sped away eastward across the Atlantic at terrific speed.

On June 21, 1962, several police posts in Buenos Aires province reported seeing a huge cigar-shaped object flying at high speed just above the treetops. It was also seen from the city of La Plata.

On June 24, from midnight until 4 a.m., people in several places, such as Cordoba (Cordoba Province) and Bolivar (Buenos Aires Province), witnessed the passage of a number of large, brilliant UFOs at close quarters. This was described as "a new era with regard to the UFO problem."

The many sightings during this period provoked considerable comment and speculation among the Argentine press and public. A number of the more important incidents were published in the Buenos Aires daily newspaper "La Prensa" on June 30.

The paper stated that the police and the armed forces had been called out on a number of occasions to investigate the UFO reports. It also mentioned that representatives of the Aeronautical Commission for the Investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects (CAIFOs) had been busy inquiring into the sightings.

The Buenos Aires newspaper "El Mundo" on July 1 reported that the Argentine Ministry of Defense and the Police in La Plata had summoned all eye-witnesses to a special lecture and gave instructions as to how they should conduct themselves when future sightings occurred.

well-like dust had poured down on Salto and was observed by several persons, this first happening on July 27, 1962 at about 8:30 p.m. It was described as a light dusting falling from the sky,
Plant at Sauce. Viejo (near Santa Fe, which is approximately 70 miles from Salto) a similar phenomenon was observed between July 29 and August 3 1962. This consisted of a greenish dust which fell to a height of about 1,600 meters and gave out flashes, some of which occurred before the fall, and after the fall, several times.
For these UFOs the witnesses, some schoolchildren in the town of Villa Tunyavan saw three UFOs pass overhead
On this occasion the objects were described as brightly illuminated, flying at a height of about 80 meters and emitting a silvery flashes.
On August 2 a similar phenomena was observed in Tordillo, a small town about 30 miles from Salto.
V.V.E. The witness, an engineer named Ticardo E., from Rosario, stated that on July 27, 1962 at about 8:30 p.m. he observed a luminous phenomenon which he described as a luminous object, circular in shape, approximately 8 meters in diameter, passing at high speed over Salto from northeast to southwest. It was visible for about 10 seconds. Two similar objects were observed about 15 minutes later, traveling in the same direction as they were. In addition there was light phenomenon apparently unconnected with the UFOs that was observed over Salto for several attempts, but in vain, to escape from it by accelerating and turning in different directions.
On August 2 various papers carried detailed accounts of a luminous object seen in the province of Buenos Aires, the object was described as being a luminous spherical body about 6 meters in diameter. From the information received, it appears that this was a luminous object drifting above at high speed, without any deviation from a straight course, and disappearing into the distance without making a sound.
On August 7 various papers carried a report stating that a citizen had claimed that he had been "attacked" by a luminous object while driving his truck at 1:45 a.m. from Olivos, suburb of Buenos Aires. The object, according to the report, approached the vehicle, surrounding it with a bluish light. The witness, alarmed, accelerated his vehicle to 80 km per hour, but the light was insufficient. Several attempts were made to escape from it, but without success. The luminous object continued to follow the vehicle until near Campana, when it suddenly and abruptly across country and vanished. Senior police officials mentioned the case to the local press and newspapers that such a craft could tangentially only be considered stellar.
On August 2 various papers carried detailed accounts of a luminous object seen in the province of Buenos Aires, the object was described as being a luminous spherical body about 6 meters in diameter.

The plane was reportedly sighted by between 30 to 40 other people in the coastal area of the Argentine, he and his son Hugo Sáenz had seen previously unidentified aircraft which he described as silvery, variable-shaped crafts of impressive size, which he was able to observe for several minutes at a time. Although absolutely certain that in the depths of the Gulf of San Matías, visible there flying through the air at low altitude were peculiar and unusual craft, with non-conventional performance capabilities, there has not been any record of Patagonia, where it is a regular and highly intelligent activity.

"Soviet submarines"

Readers will recall the items of February, 1960, where reference was made to certain press reports in that, in trying (over a period of nearly two weeks) to track a submarine in the Gulf of San Matías, near the coast of Argentina, Navy aircraft and ships were unable to do so and they suspected that this was not a conventional submarine. As the sketch map shows, this gulf is close to the Straits of San Matías, where Soviet and other type submarines are known to operate. Bearing in mind that only a few years ago, some Argentine and British press reports spoke of "submarines" that might have been of the unconventional type, there is current batch of reports containing statements by citizens of the area that their attention has in recent years been directed to strange and unusual submarine phenomena, apparently between Chubut and Comodoro Rivadavia, it is an astonishing situation. All this is but a 'sound which I have made from one batch of clippings sent to us by a bank official in the Argentine. He says that there are ten such clippings, but that he finds them so unusual that he asks for any further details that we may be able to supply on this."

In Argentina

"The two that seemed to have a bright flame were
dark metallic objects, disc shaped. The flames were easily observed. (They seemed to be enveloping the objects.) They were traveling at a tremendous speed which made it difficult to observe details. On two occasions they appeared to be firing beams which illuminated the ground below.
The objects were sighted over a three-day period and on two occasions were seen to drop or almost land but then took off again at terrific speeds. The objects were estimated to be approximately one mile in diameter."

So ended the first report in the A.P.R.O. Bulletin for July, 1962. The report described sightings of unusual aerial phenomena observed over Argentina during May 1962. No specific details were provided regarding the source of the report or further information about the sightings.
