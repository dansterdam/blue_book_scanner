11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted four objects on the night of 17 Feb 68 and one on the night of 18 Feb 68. All 5 objects were from about 1000 yards on the horizon and each was described as a bright light. The observer stated that the objects were very much like a balloon, several of the objects were observed to drop off spark like particles before burning out.

Description

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a document describing "Garnet Bag Hot Air Balloons". The text describes the characteristics and behavior of hot air balloons made from garnet bags, including their appearance, movement, and eventual disappearance.

GARNET BAG HOT AIR BALLOONS

Hot Air Balloons, made out of garnet bags, usually appear as a red, orange, yellow or white light in the sky and may remain short as long as ten or fifteen minutes. If they stay longer, they may appear as two objects, one on top of the other. The bottom object is the heat source and is quite bright; the upper dull glowing object is the garnet bag. Usually the heat source is on a wood platform. When the object is aloft it may move in an erratic manner or a straight trajectory, depending on the wind. The balloons also flash and flickers as the wind blows the candles down, the platform may catch fire and pieces of burning debris to fall; however, they usually burn out before they hit the earth. Shortly after the sparks stop falling, the object disappears.

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, containing a diagram and a questionnaire about the sighting of unidentified phenomena. The diagram appears to show the angular elevation of the sighted object relative to the observer. There is no photograph present in this image.
