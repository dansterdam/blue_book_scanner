UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Republic of Korea
Date: 10 Oct 1959
Hour: 0305
WX Clear - Visibility 10 miles plus
Description: APPROXIMATE size of the letter "c" of the word "cent" on the reverse side of penny at arm's length. Object was crescent shaped. Silver in appearance.
Direction of Motion: Very slow to west - in sight three hours 20 minutes.
Satellites: (AFCIN-J13, Phone 69219) - In sight too long.
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): In sight too long for meteor - possibly planet.
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1): N/A
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): -
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: In sight too long for aircraft moving in same direction. Possibly balloon but wind wrong.
Other: -
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Probably very good.
Analysis and Conclusions: It is believed that the information in this report is very accurate. The object was first seen at 2:16:20 bearing at 11.6 elevation when last seen at 5:36:10 elevation. This indicates the object was visible for over three hours, which is very close to the rotations rate of the earth. Planets such as Mercury and Venus appear approximately the same size as the moon.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Those orbits are smaller than that of earth have phases the same as the moon. To the naked eye Venus appears as a very bright star. -4.3 magnitude at brightest. It is brightest, but with a 20 percent less than its actual size would be apparent. On the date of this sighting only ~350 of the surface of Venus was seen from the earth was illuminated.

On the day and at the time of this sighting Venus was in the exact position of the object of this sighting from the horizon to the WSW after approximately twenty minutes.

It is not unusual for persons viewing the interior planets for the first time through an optical aid to be struck by the fact that it appears as a small moon, phases and all. Our every day experiences have left us with the impression that Venus is a life and originates its own light rather than reflecting sunlight the same as the moon.

There is no reason to believe that the object of this sighting was anything other than the planet Venus.

It appears to be a scanned document from the Department of the Air Force, with text describing a reported UFO sighting on the night of October 19, 1959 in Korea. The text states that an observer reported a crescent-shaped silver object moving very slowly toward the west, and that the observer obtained very exact data on the bearing and altitude of the object.

Venus was again reported as a UFO on the night of October 19, 1959, in Korea. An observer reported a crescent-shaped silver object moving very slowly toward the west. Observing it for three hours and twenty minutes through the telescope of a transit, he obtained very exact data on the bearing and altitude, which provided the facts required for identification. The object moved westward at a rate of approximately 15 degrees an hour, a rate close to the rotational velocity of the earth and the apparent rotational velocity of the stars. Venus at the time occupied exactly the same position as the object, and went below the horizon shortly after the reported sighting [.]

The image appears to contain a document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). There is no photograph included in this particular page. 

The text in the document is as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO.: 
DATE INFORMATION ACQUIRED: 6 October 1959
DATE REPORT SUBMITTED: 
SUBJECT: ALLEGED SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS 
LOCATION: REPUBLIC OF KOREA
DATE/TIME GROUP: 1/0125Z 

SUMMARY: On 1 October 1959, between 0100 and 0130 hours, local time, a single observer claimed to have sighted several unidentified flying objects over the southern portion of the Republic of Korea. The objects were described as bright, luminous, pulsating lights maneuvering in a random fashion at high altitudes. The observer stated the objects appeared to be larger than average aircraft and were traveling at a high rate of speed.

EVALUATION: The report is considered to be inconclusive since it is based on the observation of a single witness and there are no confirming reports. The objects described are consistent with the appearance of natural phenomena such as stars or planets under certain atmospheric conditions. No further investigation is deemed warranted.
