GENTLEMEN:

ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 28 AT 10:00 P.M. I RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM MY CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND, (REDACTED), HE HAD OBSERVED A GROUP OF ABOUT 5 TO 8 OBJECTS PASS OVERHEAD. AS BEST I COULD DETERMINE, THE OBJECTS WERE METALLIC, CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, BLINKED ON AND OFF, AND WERE TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. AFTER OBSERVING THEM FOR SOME TIME, HE CALLED TO ALERT ME TO THEIR PRESENCE. HERE IS THE STORY IN HIS OWN WORDS:

"AFTER RETURNING HOME FROM CHURCH ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 28, AT APPROXIMATELY 10:00 P.M., I OBSERVED A GROUP OF WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. I CALLED (REDACTED) TO ALERT HIM. PUT OFF GOING OUT UNTIL ABOUT 10:15 P.M. WHEN I DECIDED TO GO OUTSIDE AND OBSERVE THEM FURTHER. WHEN I WENT OUTSIDE, I COULD NO LONGER SEE THEM. I WAITED AROUND FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES HOPING THEY WOULD RETURN, BUT THEY DID NOT. I DECIDED TO GO BACK INSIDE. UPON RETURNING INSIDE, I IMMEDIATELY CALLED (REDACTED) TO REPORT WHAT I HAD SEEN."

I DECIDED TO CALL YOU SINCE I WAS INTERESTED IN THIS REPORT AND WANTED TO GET YOUR COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS. I AWAIT YOUR REPLY.

SINCERELY,
(REDACTED)

The text in the document states:

"IN THIS CONSTELLATION WERE FIRST NOTICED ALMOST DIRECTLY OVERHEAD 3 OBJECTS VERY SUDDENLY APPEAR IN THE NIGHT SKY. THE OBJECTS WERE VERY BRIGHT, GLOWING A BRIGHT BLUISH WHITE. THEY SEEMED TO BE HOVERING OR STATIONARY, THEN THEY STARTED MOVING RAPIDLY. THEY WERE VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 45 SECONDS BEFORE DISAPPEARING SUDDENLY."

"TO MY ASTONISHMENT, I COULD NOT CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE OBJECTS AND WAS COMPELLED TO LOOK AWAY AS IT WAS HURTING MY EYES. DURING THIS TIME I WAS GETTING A SICK FEELING RISING FROM MY STOMACH UP INTO MY THROAT. HE SAID HE WOULD GO TO THE DOCTOR, BUT COUGHING AND TALKING WAS BECOMING DIFFICULT SO HE THOUGHT IT WISE NOT TO DO SO. AFTER SALIVING, I WENT OUTSIDE ONCE MORE AND THE OBJECTS WERE NO LONGER VISIBLE."

REFLECTION: INVERSION PRESENT: PHOTO ANALYSIS: PHYSICAL SPECIMEN ANALYSIS:
BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: College student, amateur astronomer, out observing stars. Observed 2-3 objects fly past, changed position from right to left. Total observation about 8 seconds, during which time the objects traversed through 15 degrees. No sound or trail. Color white but dull. Movement steady.
EVALUATION: CASE CATEGORY: Other (Birds)
CONCLUSION: Objects flew in group rather than formation. Took about 8 seconds to traverse 15 degrees of sky. At low altitude this is consistent with the speed of birds (about 30-35 mph). There was a slight light reflection effect from the movement, but this is often seen with birds, and the objects were not identified by the witness as such.
