34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 27 Day March Month 1967 Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

During the more than 20 years I spent in various aeronautical qualifications I have never observed anything of the nature. I have seen more of this type of phenomena in association with my professional duties (flying the Atlantic, etc.). I've seen many windshield reflections. I've also received radio/television interference.

But this, particularly considering my wifes qualifications and conformations, in our minds this must be an actual sighting.

In conclusion let me say that I must apologize for not having replied to your request for additional information sooner.

Major Quintanilla I must add that I do believe in UFOs - or some logical explanation of the phenomena I cannot then accept as being "space ships". This is my firm conviction and I would hasten to assure you that, whatever I may personally think, have not been influenced by what I've been through enough to-decide not to try, or went, to "snow" anyone.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

Objects which were clearly defined lights or objects which flighted by moved. There were no airplanes or helicopters or the like flying by at the time/place, they looked as though they were the only objects in the sky. Suddenly, I noticed what seemed to be a large aircraft or balloon-like object hovering and circling the area, then blinking out completely. When it reappeared, it seemed to be lower and closer and then blacked out again. This happened several times and each time it seemed closer and lower.
I don't know what it was, this Shownee Parkway area, we not through seeing or hearing about similar experiences as others in the area had related.
By the time we saw the object it had got dark there would appear to be visible an overall glowing shape like an aeroplane silhouette outlined in light that would appear to grow larger and smaller (vary in size) and then vanish completely several times over a period of time

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing a sketch and instructions for the observer.

Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observers watched a cylindrical shaped object move off toward the southwest. It discharged some diffuse material into the path of the object which was observed. The front part had a red light. The red light pulsated and the following part displayed a constant direction and constant speed. Description is consistent with that of an aircraft observation. The flashing red light could have been the anti-collision light that all aircraft must have in operation when in flight.
