METALLURGY

Metal Alloy Makes
Powerful Magnets

A SUPERIOR magnetic alloy, called Supercunducton, has been developed from iron, cobalt and vanadium, H. L. L. Gould and D. H. Wern of Bell Telephone Laboratoics, Inc., Murray Hill, N. J., report in Electrical Engineering (March).

Its exceptional physical and magnetic properties give it higher than standard test in which the alloy established six new records for heavy weights and showed three others for part of the range of metal.

It can increase the power output of a transmitter coil by 30%, and promises use of a wide range of transformers, high-frequenuture applications, memory devices and telephone receiver diaphragms, they state.

Magnetic injectors using the alloy and designed to be made in July, and still furthells sure output. With proper stack rings, electro magnets can be formed well solid in eds, and reduce the number of amplifier from-fitration from two to one, and make further lithgraphatis output massive.

The alloy is particularly valuable because it can be cold rolled like other soft magnetic materials. The thin gauges that are especially suited to modern requirements, the engineers state.

Daily Requirements of
Two B Vitamins Change

NEW "minimum daily requirements" for two of the B vitamins were proposed by the Food and Drug Administration in Washing-ton.

The proposed regulation would set a new minimum daily requirement for niacin for the first time at 10 milligrams. It would also reduce the adult minimum daily requirement for riboflavin from two milli-grams to one milligram.

The minimum daily requirements help protect consumers from exaggerated and misleading claims of the vitamin content of their tables on foods and drugs. When a food label claims a health vitamin pill contains a particular vitamin, the food is required to give just this basic by how much of the vitamin contains. Label the product which consumer in daily preferred unit supplies for adults and children of different ages.

TB Among Students
Shows Sharp Decline

IN THE PAST 15 years, the incidence of active and arrested cases of tuberculosis among college students has dropped off sharply.

This result is shown in a survey con-ducted at the University of California at Los Angeles.

The survey was conducted in the Student Health Service under the direction of Dr. Gertrude Huberty through a grant from the Los Angeles County Tuberculosis As-sociation.

Tuberculin skin reaction tests were given to more than 2,100 entering students last spring. Reactions were correlated with chest X-ray results. Nineteen percent of the group had positive reactions. Only two of this group were found to be active cases.

A similar survey in 1940-41 resulted in 42% shot positive tests, positive in 1944-47 showed 65% positive tests.

The lower figures of positives in the latter survey appear to be the result, partly, of the large influx of veterans, many of whom served in areas where exposure to disease was frequent.

"Moderne medication of tuberculosis treatment are so effective that students with active disease do not last full semesters," Dr. Huberty says. "They may return to their semester and complete their educations on an noncontagious status."

ASTRONOMY
Mercury Seen at Dusk

Jupiter and Mars can also be seen during April. The first eclipse of the year, an annular eclipse of the sun, will occur on April 29. Naked-eye comet scheduled.

By JAMES STOKLEY

> MERCURY, smallest of the nine planets and nearest of the nine to the sun around which they revolve, will make one of its rare appearances about the middle of April. On the 15th it will be farthest east of the sun - greatest eastern elongation" the astronomer calls it - and for a few days it will remain just above the western horizon at sunset. Since next to the Moon it will set about an hour and three quarters after the sun, you will have to look for it at dusk gathers. By the time the western sky is completely dark, Mercury will also have gone out of sight.

Because of this, Mercury does not appear in the accompanying graphs, which show how the sky will look about 10 o'clock, our own kind of standard time, at the beginning of April. It will appear similarly about 9:00 p.m. at the middle of the month, and about 8:00 p.m. at the end of the month.

Also not shown on the accompanying maps is the comet scheduled to be visible from the northern hemisphere in April and May. It is predicted to blaze forth as a zero magnitude, making it one of the ten brightest objects in the sky at that time. 

If the comet lives up to expectations, it will be the biggest and most spectacular of its breed during the 20th century, brighter than Halley's Comet, last seen in 1910.

Known as Comet Arend-Roland after the two Belgian astronomers who discovered it, the guest was first spotted on Nov. 8, 1956. It gained as expected and has since broadened followed it with their telescopes until it reach one degree can be It can then. By the end of April, it will be far enough away from the sun to be visible again.

Its brilliance will fade rapidly and will disappear from naked-eye he first of June During late April, the comet will appear w hour before midnight in the east south went, between the constellations of Andro-meda and Aries, far below Mars.

Mercury reaches its greatest western elongation on April 8, when it will be only 29.7 million mies from the sun.

Three other familiar wanderers are shown. Brightest is Jupiter, which shines high in the west in the constellation of Virgo, the maiden. As a nearly "stellar" star, about 15 minutes of arc in apparent diameter. Venus follows a similar inclination and will eventually position itself where it will trade places with Saturn, although it is now moving far out in the distance from the Earth.

Nine First Magnitude Stars

In addition to Capella, nine other bright stars (i.e., of the first magnitude) are now visible. Low on the northwest is Sirius, the Dog star, part of Canis Major, the great dog. To the right, directly west, is Orion, the warrior. Part of his figure is below the horizon, at the times for which our maps are drawn, but Betelgeuse is still visible, as is the other star in this warrior's belt. Farther to the right is Taurus, the bull, in which Mars now stands. Below the planet is Aldebaran, a first-magnitude star, although 15° below the actual size its dimmed. Above Orion is the figure of Gemini, the twins, with Pollux, of the first magnitude, and Castot, of the second, "To the right of this group are the bright stars".

In Canis Minor, the lesser dog. Still farther to the left, high in the southern sky, is Leo, the lion, with its bright star Regulus. This star, with a semicircle of stars just above, forms a little figure known as the sickle, which is familiar to us by its corresponding more southerly position in the sky.

Directly south is the head, or the lead-driver, stellation and Virgo, the virgin, with Spica, as well as Jupiter. A temporary thicker is the new star in Scorpio. To the brightest star of Lyra, the lyre, is indicated. Even more than Aldebaran, its brilliance is dimmed by its low altitude, but later in the month as it climbs toward the south, you will be able to see its starlike white-greenish color glow.

By that the time another planet will have appeared. Saturn, in the constellation of Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer, rises in the east a little before midnight. Venus, which has not been mentioned, passes behind the sun on April 14, so all month it is too nearly in line with that body to be seen.

Annular Eclipse of Sun

The first eclipse of the year occurs on April 29, but only in the northwestern United States, western Canada and Alaska will North Americans be able to see it. This is an eclipse of the sun, not total, but annular. Although the the moon passes between sun and earth, its distance from us is so great that its apparent di-ameter is not enough to cover the entire sun completely, as it does in a total solar eclipse. Instead, a ring of sunlight will remain visible around the dark lunar disc. To see the effect, you will have to be standing along a curved area in the Arctic Ocean north of Russia. Over part of European Russia, most of Asia and northwestern North America there will be a partial eclipse, with the moon passing partly in front of the sun but not covering all. For these people it will start at 5:05 p.m. PST., and end at 6:14 p.m At 5:40 the eclipse will be at its maxi-mum of 52.5% of the solar diameter covered, or will not be a very large circle. At Anchorage, Alaska, it lasts from 2:01 minutes before to last 3:00 a.m. when the overall half the solar diameter will be blocked out.

Mercury, which appears at the middle of April, has mean distance from the sun of only 36,000,000 miles, somewhat moro than a third the earth's distance of 93,000, 000 miles.
As it swings around the sun, it ,appears alternately to the west and east of that body. In the former case it moves ahead of the sun as they make their daily trip around the sky. Then it may appear just before sunrise, in the morning twilight. When east of the sun, as it is in April, it remains above the western horizon after the sun has set. However, this does not always bring it into our view.
When such an eastern "elongation" occurs in the autumn, it is not nearly as favorable for evening viewing as when it occurs in the spring.
In April this year conditions are almost at their best, so take advantage of your opportunity.
Even when Mercury does thus come into view, it neve remains visible after twilight has faded and it is never seen very high in the sky, while the period over which it can be easily observed is not more than about a week.
The great Polish astronomer Copernicus, who showed that the planets revolve around the sun, is said never to have seen Mercury. Even at on elongation, the low-flying mists usually obscured it.

Visiting Comet
To Be Visible
On Saturday
Clear skies permitting, a visi-
tor from outer space will be
visible at sunset Saturday.
The Arend-Roland comet
reached its closest position to
the earth April 8, and now is
retreating.
It should be sufficiently far
enough away from the sun to
be seen by the naked eye at sun-
set Saturday.
Its tail will be pointing away
from the sun, and it should be
as bright as a brightest star
in the April sky.
The comet should be visible
about one hour after the sun
has set in the West, where
the sun sets.
About May 1, the comet will
have risen higher in the west-
ern sky, passing between the
constellations Cepalis
give the comet constellation.
The comet has been named for two
Belgian astronomers who disco-
vered it Nov. 8, 1956, should be
visible for the rest of Aprii and
May.

ASTRONOMY
New Comet Will be
Visible to Naked Eye

A BRIGHT new comet will be visible
to the naked eye in late April and early May
It may shine at zero magnitude making
it one of the most brilliant objects in the
sky at that time. Known as Comet Arend-
Roland, the object was discovered on Nov.
8, 1956. (See SNL Dec. 1,
1956, p. 345).
Since then astronomers both here and
abroad have followed it with their telescopes
and now have sufficient observations to plot
its future path in the sky.
Although it can be seen by persons in
the Southern Hemisphere before dawn dur-
ing the first half of April, people in the
Northern Hemisphere will not be able to
look at it until the end of April and the
beginning of May after sunset. Then the
comet will have passed between the earth
and the sun.
Its brilliance will fade rapidly and it will
disappear from naked-eye view by the first
of June. During the last part of April it
wfil appear very low in the northwest sky
after sunset.

GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH ASTRONOMY
COMETS – 1
AS OUR SUN drifts through space toward the constellation Hercules, it carries along an enormous cloud of comment, an envelope so extensive it reaches much of the way to the nearest star.

Practically none of the multitudes of objects making up this cloud resembles the traditional picture of comets. They do not have fuzzy comas or long tails. Instead, typical comets when far from the sun are relatively small solid objects. These are believed to be fluffy masses of frozen gases and ice mingled with some heavier materials, like loosely packed dirty snowballs miles in diameter. All of them are moving in more or less elongated paths around the sun.

Only when one of these snowballs penetrates into the inner parts of the planetary system does its appearance change. Solar heating evaporates its surface layers, forming a halo of gas and dust. As the comet approaches nearer to the sun, this shedding may proceed until we see that the small, bright nucleus is surrounded by a nebulous coma many thousands of miles across, with a tail millions of miles long pointing away from the sun. Then, as the comet recedes, the tail and coma shrink and vanish, leaving only the nucleus. Since the ejecta and dust have been permanently lost into interplanetary space, each time a comet passes near the sun its mass is depleted. On a cosmic time scale, it is a temporary body.

Of the vast host of comets in our solar system, only a very small fraction pass near enough to sun and Earth to become bright enough for detection. Since the dawn of history about 1,500 comets have been recorded with some certainty. The number is indefinite, partly because ancient writings often do not distinguish clearly between comets and novae.

During the present century, comets have been discovered at an average rate of five or six per year. One banner year was 1960, during which no fewer than 25 were under observation; eight previous comets, four new ones, nine returning periodic comets, and two "annual" comets (visible in all parts of their nearly circular orbits). Remarkably, observations of all 25 were obtained by Elizabeth Roemer with the U.S. Naval Observatory’s 40-inch telescope in Arizona.

Nearly every year two or more bright comets are first recognized by amateurs with small telescopes. However, most new ones are relatively faint objects, picked up accidentally in the course of observing programs with fast, wide-field photographic telescopes. Since 1946 a systematic visual search has been maintained at Skalnate Pleso Observatory in Czechoslovakia, with 25 to 30 binoculars. On the average, this highly successful program yields one comet per 500 hours of sweeping.😊As soon as a new comet is discovered (one is reported to the astronomical information centers at Harvard and Copenhagen observatories, it receives a provisional year-and-letter designation. Thus the first comet found in 1956, by the Japanese amateur Rev. Ikeya, became 1956a. This was detected last year on October 9th and calculated to lead and orbit. The comet picked up on its 11th return since H. d’Arrest discovered it in 1851.

Several years after discovery, those comets whose orbits are definitely known receive permanent Roman-numeral labels indicating the time order of their passage through perihelion. Thus 1956 I (initially called 1956a) was the first of the nine observed comets whose perihelion dates came that year.

After three or more accurate positions of a new comet have been measured at intervals of a few days, an approximate orbit can be computed. Normally three suffice, but not if the three points of the celestial sphere can be joined by a great circle. In this and certain other ambiguous cases, a fourth observation must be added.

Arend-Roland 1956h became one of the brightest comets in recent years. It was a conspicuous naked-eye feature in the evening spring sky of 1957. This photograph was taken on May 25 that year by a New York amateur astronomer, Charles Slabsm. At the time, he estimated the visual magnitude of 1956h as 3.5. This comet had an anomalous second tail pointing sunward, in the form of a long narrow spike, that was outstanding about April 25th, but less conspicuous when this picture was made.
 The visual appearance of many comets is suggested by this Naval Observatory photograph of 1956e (Burnham-Slaughter) on November 10, 1956, four months before perihelion. Stars are trailed because the 40-inch telescope was guided to follow the moving comet during the 63-minute-long exposure. The comet was then 223 million miles from the sun.

In these preliminary orbit calculations, it is assumed that the path around the sun is a parabola—always a good approximation for the whole long. The parabola can be specified exactly by five constants, which may be illustrated by Comet Kenna-Kwee 1963d: 

1. This object was closest to the sun on October 28, 1963, at a distance of 2.5 astronomical units. Its orbit is in a plane inclined 9.◦ to that of the earth's orbit. The intersection line of these two planes points toward heliocentric longitude 324◦, 

marking the ascending node, or passage of the comet northward across the eliptic. Finally, the angle in the comet's orbital plane is 113◦ from the ascending node to perihelion.

Nowadays, it is common for a comet to remain under observation for several months before it becomes too faint to follow. (Comet Stearns 1927 IV was tracked for four years before it was lost.) It is then possible to compute a definitive orbit, which utilizes all the positional measurements. In this calculation the shape of the orbit is determined, instead of being assumed parabolic.

Almost always, the orbit is highly elongated, with only a small arc covered by our observations. Halley's Comet, for instance, has a period of 76 years, but during its last return (perihelion was on April 19, 1910) it could be observed only from September, 1909, to July, 1911. The path of Halley's Comet is an ellipse of eccentricity 0.967, its distance from the sun ranges from 0.590 to 35.3 astronomical units. At present, this famous object is till outside Neptune's orbit, and will not be imaged on its next return to the sun’s vicinity in 1979.

Encke's Comet is notable for its short period of 3.3 years. Its perihelion point

is near the orbit of Mercury, while at aphelion it is nearly as distant as Jupiter from the sun. It just attains naked-eye visibility at favorable returns. Often Encke's Comet is said to have the shortest known period. However, the faint object 1949 III (Wilson-Harrington) has been assigned a period of 2.5 years. This poorly observed comet has never been seen since its discovery 15 years ago.

Cometary orbital motions are greatly disturbed by the gravitational attractions of the planets, especially Jupiter. We may visualize a comet orbit as an ellipse that is constantly changing slightly in size, shape, and orientation; or the occasion of an near approach to Jupiter the perihelion can be large and rapid. Very lengthy calculations are needed to follow the course of some objects for more than a few years.

Nowadays electronic computers have made the large-scale calculation of comet 
perturbations a much less formidable task. It is now feaisble to trace the motion of a comet during many revolutions and through complex transformations. The results of one such study are reported on page 16 of this issue.

An important question is whether the comets that we observe are actually original within the solar system, or whether some are interlopers from interstellar space. There are, indeed, a small fraction of comet whose orbits appear to be hyperbolic rather than closed curves, but in any particular instance it is conceivable that the observed hyperbolic shape could have been imparted by planetary perturbations.

Hence it is necessary to compute backwards, step by step, the path along which the comet approached the sun, taking accurate account of planetary perturbations. At a distance of, say, 100 astronomical units, before planetary perturbations have had an opportinuty to act appreciably, the original shape of the orbit is found. Without any significant exceptions, it turns out that the original orbits are ellipses. Thus, all comets, or nearly all, are permanent members of our solar system.

An earlier attempt to test this question failed for an interesting reason. Since the sun is slowly moving 12 miles a second toward Hercules, then more interstellar comets should tend to approach us from that direction than the opposite. More discoveries should take place in that half of the sky.

The catch to this idea is the non-random nature of comet discoveries. There are many more astronomers in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern; comets often favor warning nights to winter ones; and the evening sky is better patrolled than the morning. In fact, the distribution of discovery points over the sky is almost entirely determined by these accidental factors.

While was in my car with my family on a clear Sunday morning in April of 1957, we noticed an unidentified object, black and slightly greenish, coming toward us. As I drove slowly forward, I approached on an apparently straight course with unrelativey swift speed, overhead or in a southerly direction, above cloud level In a clear plastic canopy, we could make out a group of five or six very plunging white lights in circular form and we could see the summit of this cone as I slowed down. Initially, the object was almost entirely hidden behind the landscape. I stopped the car and kept watching this object after a few minutes I noticed there following a long and narrow oval- shaped part, apparently motionless with black color, was cleaning wind. We watched while the object seemed coming slower as the steadily in its travel compass it seemed to be about a mile and a half to two miles away and above the road obstruction it moved further in this object disappeared.
Approximately 20 feet had elapsed. In the meantime, I noticed a small diminutive aircraft following with a slightly small white colored object. 
Soon sighting disappeared, three seconds were no more than 15 seconds.

As the object disappeared more of five sequences were moved right and this seemed flying in a released corner, I don’t know whatever this object had fun onwards.

NOTE: Forly reseavi yt word, we had to mov fom the carcraft to the objects.

We had barely gotten into the highway again I saw an orange train of sparks come horizontally with Noiselessness reversed and disappeared about 2 to 3 seconds.
In retrospect to both appearances. One would expect some kind of maneuvering or what reflexes would produce, but none. It seems what is was was gone. In view of any activity we had were it was bright. It was shiny and only vaguely colored. (not white only but differing in the color I described as "polished pewter."
My wife described it as "powder bluish gray, the centered course it was resulting in almost directly into a stiff wind. After it turned and it moved almost at right angles to compensate. (The wind was S. to W. W.) It did not seem to actually wobble but appeared still exactly as it gone into course or direction.

No Case (Information Only)

4 April 1957
West Freugh, Wigtownshire
Scotland

April 4, 1957. At an RAF station near West Freugh, Wigtownshire, in southwestern Scotland, three radar operators at two posts independently tracked an "unidentified object" which "flashed across their screens traveling at 60,000 feet. The operators said the object suddenly dived to a height of 14,000 feet, made two whirls, then vanished to the south. It was last reported seen heading toward the Isle of Man." (UP declared that "officials refused to say in which direction and at what speed it was traveling.") "We do not know what the object was," an Air Ministry spokesman said. "Intelligence experts are studying the report and a detailed statement may be made next week." (UP also stated that "a mystery object spotted on radar screens in Scotland may have been a Soviet reconnaissance plane.") Royal Air Force officials said no planes were in the area at the time. Unofficial sources described it as "too fast, too big, and too manoeuverable for a plane." Full reports of the incident were turned in to the Air Ministry in London. It was stated officially that "their experts take a serious view" of such reports. No further details have been forthcoming. -- N.Y. Journal-American, Apr. 6 (INS); N.Y. Sunday News, Apr. 7 (UP Apr. 6); N.Y. Sunday Mirror, Apr. 7 (AP Apr. 6); Newark Sunday News, Apr. 7 (AP); London Sunday Dispatch, Apr. 7.

British Radar Sighting

BRITISH ISLES REVISITED

(More information on the British radar sightings of Apr. 6)

London, Evening News, April 6:
"It was never seen by the naked eye, but its position and speed were logged, clocked, and double-checked. Wing-Commander Walter Whitworth, CO., at the RAF weather radar station nearest to Lyme, was contacted by the Air Ministry to say what he knew of the object. He was allowed to break his silence, but said nothing. He took the position, checked and clocked again and went to the other stations. But by this time quite a number of people were in on the game.

"The radar sets began tracking the object, and constantly confirmed it was there. It was a clear object against a building return left on for comparison. A few minutes later a signal appeared on both screens. Each set had a duplicate, a third being switched on; they too, recorded the object."

London News Chronicle, April 6:
"Wing-Commander Whitworth was issued to the radar operators, James Foley and John Bloskey, both of Stranraer, who picked up the object on their screens."

No Case (Information Only)   10 April 1957   Norfolk, Virginia

UFO SIGHTED FROM NATIONAL AIRLINES PLANE NEAR NORFOLK

On the morning of April 10, 1957, a round silvery object was sighted from National Airlines Flight 720 by Herbert L. Nichols, Jr., construction engineer, author, and publisher. This report, which NICAP is checking, was sent in for evaluation by a NICAP member, the head of a large corporation.

Mr. Nichols is a graduate of Columbia University and from 1934 to 1941 he operated an excavation and grading business in Connecticut. in World War II he was first a civilian employee of the U.S. Army in South America and the West Indies and later a member of the Seabees in the Azation Islands.

Since the war he has not only operated his construction business but also has written and published several books. With his wife, Dr. Hazel J. Berglund, he wrote and published How to Win All Your Wars. Since then he has published several books on excavation, including How to Operate Excavation Equipment and Moving the Earth.

Mr. Nichols' firsthand report follows:

"On Wednesday morning, April 10, I was in the rear west window seat of the El Pacific plane, National Airlines Flight 720 northbound. At about 2:05 a.m., I saw a light below us, moving oppositely to our course, but slightly more toward the west. It followed the line of a highway, but when it went over a small town I could see that it was above it. The light was round, large, and bright without being dazzling.

"Just after passing over the town it went out abruptly. A moment later a dull silvery object was very faintly visible by direct reflection from the moon. Its brightness was then similar to that of the reflection of the moon in rippled water, not as bright as on still water. This reflection was faint and brief enough so that it might have been an optical illusion.

"The speed of the object was comparable to that of a southbound plane that passed to the west slightly below us a few minutes later, and that was marked by flashing red and white lights. The air was perfectly clear, with a few very high clouds, Plane height had been stated to be 18,000 or 19,000 feet. A few minutes later we passed over a city which I believe to be Norfolk, Virginia.

"The light was definitely in the air, and it was too large to be an airplane light, and was perfectly steady in intensity. Its color was a clear white like an automobile head-light. It was in sight for at least five seconds, and perhaps three times as long.

"The light was probably smaller than a dime at arm's length, but was large enough to appear definitely circular in outline. The unlighted machine was at least as large, or possibly larger, and gave an impression of roundness also. But it was then very indistinct, and protrusions would not have been visible."

* * * * *

If any NICAP members in the area approximately 10 to 50 miles south of Norfolk sighted any object at this time or heard of such a sighting, please communicate with NICAP. Reporting forms will be sent on request. NICAP is also communicating with the Civil Air Administration and with the crew of National Airlines Flight 720 to see whether the object was sighted by the pilots and from any CAA towers along the route –

Sault Ste. Marie, Ont

source: Flying Soucer - Oct 57

I saw a saucer on April 21, 1957;
Next day I sent the report to the
Air Force in Washington and got no
reply. I would have sent the sight-
ing to you in your first issue but I
did not know there was such a mag-
azine at the time. The time was a-
bout 12:15 P.M. (EST), the sky was
clear so I decided it would be a good
night to look through my telescope.
As I was about to lift my telescope
to look, a saucer appeared right over
me in the eastern sky. The object
was pretty close to me as I could
make it out very well. The saucer 
was lighted yellow, it had a circular
disc with a dome on top. On the 
dome I could see a round window. I
saw no one inside. I sighted it for 
about a half minute when it disap-
peared behind our house (I was 
standing at the side of it). As I could
see it, it was the size of a kite. The
object was heading southwest at a
very fast speed. It did not make any
sound.

residents of Flanders, Long Island (at the eastern end of Suffolk County.) They
glided silently over at half-minute intervals (for similarities, see the Nov. 16 report from New Rochelle) and one witness, Michael Pace of 869 Flanders Road, estimated their altitude at 1000 feet and their speed at 200 to 300 mph. Lt.Col. Frederick Pileoty, executive officer at the Suffolk County Air Force Base, said the Air Force is investigating. "I have no idea what these objects could be," he said. "We had nothing but routine patrols in the air." -- Long Island Daily Press, April 22, 1957.

No Case (Information Only) 					22 April 1957
								Palalda, France

	Palalda - April 22, 1957

	Since this case has not been described previously in the News Letter, we give below a practically complete translation of Guieu’s article in Ouranos about his personal investigation.

	On Monday, April 22, at 1 p.m., Mr. and Mrs. [Blank], farmers of Palalda, were in their cabin beside their cherry orchard. Mrs. [Blank] was washing the luncheon dishes when she became aware of an unusual roaring noise outside. She stepped outdoors to see what caused the noise, and saw an enormous vortex of blue and red flames approaching from the north. At an altitude of only ten or fifteen yards above the ground, it was descending toward their vineyard. It had the appearance of a cone of flames, spinning very rapidly but moving forward slowly. Frightened, Mrs. [Blank] called her husband. They watched the flying object together, as it hovered for about a minute at a point 15 feet from the western edge of the field and 15 feet above the ground. The vine shoots near it were violently agitated, and the soil was set spinning in a cloud of dust that seemed to be sucked up toward the object. Throughout, a deafening uproar was emitted. The vortex then resumed its flight southward above the field, but stopped again after traveling 100 yards and hovered 15 to 30 feet above some cherry trees in a hollow, near a bridge. The branches and foliage of these trees were violently whipped about and bent back and forth in every direction, until it seemed that the limbs would be torn off. The cone then resumed its slow course and climbed a hill – keeping about 30 yards above the ground but at the top of the hill rose abruptly into the sky and shot away at prodigious speed toward the southwest.

	No solid “machine” was discerned by the witnesses – nothing but a conical vortex of red and blue “flame”, the point downward, whose diameter at the top was about 15 feet. The size and shape could not be stated precisely, because some of the “flames” emerged in all directions from the whirl, but in general it was conical.

	Where the UFO had hovered in the vineyard, the ground was violently swept about and disordered. The vines were not in the least scorched, although the cone had been only 15 feet above them, so probably the “flames” were not ordinary flames but some form of ionization phenomenon.

	About five yards west of this stopping-point runs a metal fence in a very bad state of preservation, consisting of an irregular wire mesh strung on rusty iron uprights of T-shaped cross-section, interspersed with wooden posts. The only compass showing magnetism was the iron one closest to the stopping-point, which deflected a compass needle by 30°, the effect was noticeable even a foot away from the post. The other iron fence posts – the nearest of which is five yards from the magnetized post – caused no compass deviation at all. This tends to show that something unusual had affected the one first examined. Neither was there any residual magnetism detectable in the ground. These tests were made in the presence of Messrs. Jacques Verpillot, Ouranos investigator from Marseille, and Paul Jaubert, retired magistrate and Ouranos correspondent for Palalda.
	In company with Dr. Marcel Pagès, Ouranos investigator for Pyrenees-Orientales, M. Verpilllot and I visited the police station at Amelie-Les-Bains and informed them of this sighting, playing the taped interview with the witnesses for them. The gendarmes told us that the Basques enjoy an excellent reputation in the community, but expressed surprise that the incident had not been reported to them in the first place. We explained that this was because the witnesses had feared ridicule; this fear had been disarmed by the scientific character of our investigation. We assured the police that, on our request, they were willing to give them a complete report. On May II the police went to the farm to make inquiries.

On Monday April 22, 1957 at 1:00 P.M. Mr. &Mrs. ****** could be found in 
a little wooden cabin on the far side of their wine vineyards after lunch. Mrs. 
****** was washing the dishes when all of a sudden she heard a terrible racket and 
noise all around the little cabin. She ran outside and when she glanced up she ob- 
served an enormous whirlWLind of blue and red flames that at approximately 10 -15 
meters of" altitude began to descend on the vineyards. 

Frightened Mrs. ****** asked her husband to come' and join her and see what she 
was frightened about. The "thing" had the aspect of a cone of flames that were 
whirling around the thing itself at a slightly turning speed but the "thing" did 
not displace even slightly from its bearing. 

The flying object stopped for approximately 1 minute at 5 meters from the west- 
ern part of the field, It maintained itself at an altitude of approximately 5 me- 
ters from the ground. In the course of the first stop the vine stocks were strongly 
agitated and so was the ground as they underwent a sort of aspiration that was 
directed in an upward direction (therefore towards the apparatus) and the appara- 
tus was meanwhile violently whirling. The object whose giration on the spot was 
accompanied with a deafening sound, recovered the flight above the field and then 
descended towards the south at approximately 400 meters from the first stop at 
5 to 10 meters from a clump of trees (cherry trees) in a gap in the ground near a 
bridge. 

The gyrating cone created a violent turbulence (?) that brutally and roughly 
made the leaves and the branches of the trees shake. The latter, according to the 
witnesses, were bent in several manners. Their branches and leaves seem to be on 
the point of being yanked out. The cone of red and blue flames once more started 
on its slow course and trajectory and then climbed the direct side of a hill (at 
approximately 30 meters from the ground) then having reached the top of the hill 
it rapidly ascended into the sky at a very rapid rate of speed and disappeared. 
The latter disappeared in a North-Easterly direction.

OCR Text Output:

At no time did the witnesses see the so called "apparatus" itself all they claim 
to have seen was the turbulent mass of whirling flames that were red and blue and 
were in the form of a cone and the point of which was directed towards the ground
and the peak of the latter was approximately 5 meters long. 

The witnesses could not be exact in relation to the form of the apparatus as the
latter was completely covered with flames that were oscillating in all directions
and whirling but they did think that the ensemble on the whole seemed to have a
cone-shaped aspect.

At the time that D.V.N.I. (U.F.O.) went to the vineyards the ground was violently
sweet and turbulent. Even though the apparatus was only 5 meters from the ground
we found no trace of burned spots on the ground or any calcination. Therefore one 
is not really dealing with "flames" but with some phenomenon of ionization.

At approximately 5 meters from the immobilization point we found a metallic fence
,in very bad condition, of latticed irregular links and metallic wire lattice work 
posts. The other part of the fence had wooden posts. Only the wire post (approximately 
1 meter high) that was situated at approximately 5 meters from the immobilization
point presented a magnetism. This magnetism made the needle of the compass undergo
a 30 degree deviation. The 30 degree deviation of the T-shaped wire post became
sensitive and increased in a gradual manner in proportion to the proximity of the 
compass.

Thus, the other wire posts (that were situated at approximately 5 meters from 
the magnetized T-shaped wire fence post) did not present any magnetism. Thus the 
latter did not barely make the needle vary at all. This remained constant even when
the compass was placed within 4 centimeters of the latter. This negative test result
tends to prove, on the one hand, that the mass of these bars (all of the same nature)
is not sufficient to provoke a sensitive deviation of the needle with the only excep
tion being that that was already registered and is in absolutely no way an inherent
quality of this metal.

The text found in the document is as follows:

There was no trace of magnetism on the ground near the immobilization points and the around the place where the object was supposedly present.

These tests and these reports have been executed in the presence of Mr. Jacques Bergier and Jacques Vallee who are related to CROFF. Changes in Poland.

We were rejoined in Amelle-les-Bains by Dr. Marcel Pages, who is the investigator of the G.P.E. in the Pyrennes-Orientales province. Mr. N.J. Verplilot and myself went to the obervation station of Amelie-les-Bains where we were received by the warrant officer Mahoux and the policemen Fouiade and Barbe. We have received the observations that had been made by the latter in Palada and on the testimonies that were supplied to us.

These observers were surprised at the lack of respect that the witnesses gave them. We explained to them that this attitude on the part of the witnesses was more than likely due to the fact that they did not want to appear ridiculous. Anyway, in relation to the scientific character of our investigation, the witnesses did agree to make a statement as the police station and this was in fact executed on the 13th of May.

This event offers more than an analogical comparison with that that occurred in Villas-sur-Garonne (Var) or April 14,1927. At Vina the apparatus that was seen was metallic and cone-shaped and the only thing that is lacked was the "Flames". The one observed in Palada was considered a "flaming" cone that was apparently the reason why the shape of the apparatus was not immediately discernible. In fact, the "flaming saucers" are frequently hidden in a flamboyant halo and falling lumination and both of these are more than likely due to some ionisation phenomenon.

According to the two observations the ground was swept and roughed up and scattered by the apparatus. If at Villas-sur-Garonne the magnetism that was intolerated was 12 degrees deviation of the needle of the compass and at Palada the deviation was 20 degrees. And one must keep in mind the fact that the T-shaped wire fence imitating is rather inferior to that of the signal poles from Vina.

Meanwhile the apparatus that was observed at Vins was silent. The noise that was produced and heard was supposedly due to the violent vibrations of the signal poles that were apparently subjected to the intensity of the natural magnetic field of the apparatus. In Palalda it was the apparatus itself that produced the noise that attracted the attention of the witnesses. The latter had an excellent reputation in the village and this reputation was confirmed by the police station and the warrant officer.

Let us make note of the fact that in Palalda the fence - made of slim wire posts and some wood and some latticed grill work - was not able to produce the noise that was reported by the witnesses even though it was also subjected to the same type of vibrations.

We are therefore dealing with two types of apparatus that are similar in form and size and in there manageability but different in "mechanical" manifestation as although they apparently are similar they are both silenced by means of some sort of a special device that utilizes the magnetic field.

Conclusions:

No Nation on the earth has aircraft that are silent in maneuvers and silenced by a propellor system and therefore it is ipso facto that these apparatus come from another world. On the other hand the new type of apparatus that have begun to be manifested in a singular manner let one suppose that other apparatus of this type will soon appear. It will therefore be indispensable that the witnesses that should observe these "phenomenons" not hesitate in informing and placing themselves in touch with police stations or our Investigational Bureau,or the press.

Note:
A new magnetic examination was conducted by Dr. Pages one month after the investigation and the examination by Jimmy Guieu. This indeed exposed the fact that metallic posts had an inversed rate of magnetism. The almost exact same as in Vins one can ask

whether or not the proximity of the apparatus can possibly cause the apparatus that are near to be temporarily neutralized in relation to their normal state and yet cause others to be modified or increased ? Periodical measurements will be conducted on these pieces of fence in order to establish their eventual magnetism.

ASTRONOMY

Await Brilliant New Comet

ASTRONOMERS around the world are 
anxiously waiting for their first glimpse
of a comet that may rival or exceed Halley’s
Comet of 1910 in brilliance.

Observers in the Southern Hemisphere
will have the first crack at seeing the comet
as it starts drawing away from the sun
after April 8. Astronomers in the Northern
Hemisphere will have to wait until toward
the end of April for their first look at
Comet Arend-Roland.

Known also as comet 1956 h, it was dis-
covered by S. Arend and M. Roland on
photographs taken at the Royal Observa-
tory, Uccle, Belgium, on Nov. 8, 1956. At
that time, the comet was a diffuse object 
of magnitude 10, too faint to be seen with-
out a telescope. Since then, many obser-
vations have been made by astronomers
around the world, and several orbits have
been computed.
    The magnitude Comet Arend-Roland will
    have when it is again seen is not known
    definitely. Although it is expected to be
    quite bright, predictions of a comet’s mag-
    nitude are notoriously uncertain. Whether
    it will, in fact, make as spectacular a heaven-
    ly display as Halley’s Comet will not be
    known until Comet Arend-Roland is again
    visible.

The reason is that passage near the sun
affects the internal constitution of a comet,
and sometimes a comet brightens much
more than is expected. This was the case
with Halley’s Comet.

The comet is scheduled to reach the point 
in its orbit closest to the sun on April 8, 
astronomers at the U. S. Naval Observatory
in Washington report. At that time, its
distance from the sun will be about 30,000,
000 miles, or about one-third the distance
of the earth from the sun; its distance from 
the earth will be about 85,000,000 miles at 
the same time.
   During March and the first part of April,
    the comet's apparent position in the sky
    will be too close to the sun to permit ob-
    servations. After mid-April, however, the 
    comet will move rapidly northward in the
    sky. Then it will appear very low in the
    northwest sky after sunset, between the
    constellations of Andromeda and Aries, the
    ram.
 Its brilliance will fade rapidly as it climbs
in the sky, and the object is expected to
disappear from naked-eye view by the first
of June, although it will continue to be
visible through a telescope for a few more
weeks.
    On April 22, the comet will be in the
    constellation, Triangulum, the triangle, very 
    close to the position where it was first 
    spotted five and one-half months previously.
Images of the comet have since been
found on photographs taken on Nov. 7,
one day earlier than the original discovery.
These photographs were made by S. Kaho
of the Tokyo Observatory for research con-
nected with variable stars.

Smoke Trailing Disc Reported Over New Zealand
Similar to 1952 Peru Case

A unique daytime sighting report of a smoke-trailing disc, estimated at several hundred feet in diameter, has just been released to NICAP by a New Zealand fishing-boat captain and boat builder. Withheld from publication until now, this report by Ronald L. Matheson of Mount Maunganui, New Zealand, is backed by his employer, Samuel E. Rix, Director of the Tauranga Big Game Fishing Club. Rix fully vouches for Matheson’s qualifications and integrity and also attests that the facts in the report are genuine and accurate.

Mr. Matheson’s report follows:

I am a licensed skipper of the Tauranga Big Game Fishing Club, and am also a boat-builder. I have lived at Mount Maunganui for slightly over twenty years, but have never before seen anything even remotely similar to the object described in this account.

On April 27, 1957, at 4:30 pm, I was navigating the Rosa, a fishing boat, off Port Charles on the Coromandel coast. I was approaching Channel Island when I noticed an irregular smoke trail which seemed to rise from behind the island. As I came abreast of Channel Island I saw an oval, disc-shaped object from which the smoke or vapor was streaming. The object was travelling horizontally. Two saucers fitted together face to face would be roughly similar to its appearance. Smoke streamed away from its sides as it moved on an irregular, constantly changing course throughout the sky.

As I watched, the object approached me on a slight angle bearing to the left. It then tilted at a steep angle and, shooting upwards, showed its circular shape clearly. It appeared as big as a soccer ball at arm's length. The rapid maneuvers it made covered an arc of about 15 degrees. For a period of at least twenty minutes I watched these movements, while I steered the Rosa out towards the Hauraki Gulf.

Not knowing the actual size of the object makes it hard for me to say how far away it was. I believe though that it was some miles off-shore. The object was perfectly clearly defined. Smoke poured out from its curving sides. For minutes it twisted slightly, then broadened out into a wider- climbing and whirling smoke stream. The smoke rose at such an angle that I am sure it remained in the sky for at least ten minutes before vanishing.

The movements in the sky—plunging, ascending swiftly and turning through every imaginable angle—I was able to get an unmistakable impression of its shape.

It was a huge disc. Its rapid movements suggested tremendous power. Moving in a horizontal flight, it appeared to cover a distance of miles in as many seconds. I consider that it was a very large object and that it may have been several hundred feet in diameter. I make this statement having seen Pan American airliners at what I believe was approximately the same distance.

Just before flying off, it leveled out and then moved away rapidly in a southerly flight, passing over the mainland in the direction of Waikato and Cape Rodney where it disappeared from sight. The smoke stream remained visible for some time, then slowly faded out and finally disappeared.

During these few moments my nerves floated in suspense. However, the object may not have been a solid reality as we know objects to be. 

I have made my notes as accurate as I can make it. I feel that what I saw is important enough to justify such a hope that this report—fantastic as it may appear— will be given serious consideration.

Statement by Samuel E. Rix, Director, Tauranga Big Game Fishing Club

“I have known Mr. Ronald Matheson since 1946 and can testify that he is a most reliable person. He has previously been very skeptical about reports of unusual flying objects. Now, however, he is most assured about what he has seen and certain that it is not a matter for argument.

“Knowing his practical attitude and steadiness, I am prepared to accept the accuracy of his report. It is his belief that the unidentified object described was of terrestrial origin and that its existence is being kept secret for security reasons. In my opinion, this is doubtful.”

NICAP Comment

This report is unique because of the combination of unusual smoke trails and violent maneuvers. The disc's description (light gray or greyish in most unusual day- time reports of objects not in position to reflect sunlight. It seems clear, however, that the object was not a light source, or self-luminous, as many UFO’s are described.

The presence of smoke trails and simultaneous violent maneuvers possibly could be evidence that the UFO was having mechanical trouble, especially since it

finally leveled out and departed in horizon­tal flight. Mr. Matheson’s report does not indicate whether the smoke trails continued during this final phase. (He has been queried on this point.)

At NICAP's request, the Matheson case was personally investigated by Harold H. Fulton, head of the civilian Saucer Investi­gation New Zealand, who is also a member of the Committee. Mr. Fulton indicated that the “ROSA" was in the area where UFO's had long been seen before and during the “sighting period" by the rad­ars at WAKOP, though other recuros are not confirmed. Mr. Matheson's reputa­tion for accuracy and reliability. (In the Cressent said in his opinion the UFO was genuine.) Fulton also told NICAP another New Zealand report, now under investigation, which involves 13 new eyewitnesses who reported sighting a very similar object on August 2, 1957. One group of witnesses included three school teachers and 126 pupils at a nation. The reddoeped object, which left a distinct vapor trail, was described as flying through various intricate maneuvers, including a fi­gure-eight pattern. Although the UFO was described as a definite estimated at 500 feet, witnesses heard no sound.

Aside from the smoke-trail facter, the witness changes of cover bear a close resemblance to UFO maneuvers reported by Captain H. Ruppelt, Captaiw Edward Ruppelt.

(A New UFO Encounter Convincies A Liver Captain, Former Skeptic?)

NICAP will appreciate hearing from .anyone with authentic reports similar to the New Zealand smoke-trail case.

Because the the New Zealand report NICAP believes members may be interested in the accompanying picture supposed to have geen made of a smoke-trailing object over Peru in 1952, the photograph and extract from report are reproduced with the kind permission of James Moseley, saidator of SAUCER NEWS, So an dated August 10, 1957, Mr. Moseley gave NICAP the following account of the incident.

“The Lima (Peru) director Bord, who is an aeronautical engineer. On July 19, anonomarily from in the Andes of Olios and Minos, and others saw a saucer. It about 4 p.m., and they were converging said to move re-owntally. According Bord, the radio said that the (UFO) was ac­companied by hear object going by high signs and running at phenomenal speeds, THe object, as bibliography he stated (stealie) had accelerated to more than 100 meters altitude and was a little smaller than a DC-3, according to Bordt. It made a buzzing sound as it went by."

To the object’s speed, Bordley explains, was determined by a report that it was seen four minutes later  THEN MAR deipta 120 kilometers diatatnt. This was computed at 1117 miles per hour.

The photograph was secured from a customs administrator named Domingo Trencosco, who said he had taken it as the object flew near the port. Though has no shows a disparaged objek of the round large band described, this could possibly have been to an along-elated effect caused by speed.

“It seams obvious to me,” Mosley told NICAP, "that the phodn in genuine. Inci­dentially, (I strongly doubt) if this partic­ular saucer was anything but earth-made.”

Though NICAP has no reason to doubt tin phodin’s authenticity, we are unable to make an accurate analysis without the send nagotinve.

‘Three Men in Black"

Several members have asked NICAP about Charges by various UFO investigators they “have been silenced by three mysterious ‘men in black suits.” To these queries, Mrs. Regale Solinjg, a Fresno, California member, asks whether there has been

29 April 1957
White Plains, N.Y.

April 29, 1957: At 9:55 p.m. CSI member Bill  and his wife were watching Arend-Roland from the roof of their apartment house in White Plains, New York, when they saw a flight of lights sweep across the sky, which was very clear. From the southwest, four objects about 30 degrees above the horizon, in ‘V’ formation, streaked across the sky and disappeared into the northeastern part of the night sky. The objects were very light luminous blue, and their apparent size was about that of a pinhead at arm's length. Their apparent elevation remained about the same (30 degrees); however, there was a slight downward slant (about 5 degrees) from the horizontal plane, toward the northeast. They were in view for approximately two and a half seconds; they did not appear to change their shape, color, or brightness. "I’ve watched the sky through the telescope and with the naked eye for some time and I can say I have never seen anything as odd or as strange as these four objects. In fact it gives one a kind of feeling one does not soon forget." Mr. drew the flight path of the objects on a star map; it passes between Polaris and the Comet Arend-Roland.

COMET AREND-ROLAND AND INTERLOPERS

April 29, 1957: The following report is sent to us by CSI member Herman Hitchell:

"Mr. and Mrs. .......... saw something from their backyard in Hicksville, L.I. on Monday, 29 April 1957, from 7:55 to 8:05 p.m. while looking for the comet. They looked 'right after sunset' as the papers had urged them to do, most erroneously, and saw in the northwest sky: "...the comet. It had a red body and a red tail and was moving so fast that by the time we called a neighbor it was only a faint grey streak in the sky." Since I knew from personal observation that Arend-Roland was only visible in complete darkness (two hours after sunset, and their observation was made in daylight) and most certainly was not red or moving about, I went over and nailed the details down. The ten-minute period of observation is an estimated one. The object caught their eyes in the northwest sky some 15 degrees above the horizon (or houses) and was moving steadily towards the west and losing elevation. Red, elongated body; red, slightly fan-like tail about as long as the body, "most definitely not an airplane." It flew behind a TV aerial some 100 feet away "which was of the same dimension." A dime at arm's length approximated the aerial's expanse. The object became fainter, turned into a grey streak almost due west and was lost to sight entirely slightly south of west. Mrs. van Allen is my sister."

ASTRONOMY

Comet’s Tail Explained

THE STRANGE SUNWARD tail of the brightest naked-eye comet since Halley’s, Comet Arend-Roland, consisted of small particles seen edge-on, an American astronomer reports,

Comet Arend-Roland, first sighted last November by two Belgian astronomers, was seen by millions about the end of April sky. It shown brightly in the northwst a conventional one pushed away from the comet's core by sunlight, and a surprising toward the sun. (See SNL, May 11, p. 304.)

Dr. Fred L. Whipple, director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Cambridge, Mass., says “No extraordinary> theory is needed to to account for the growth of the sunward tail by more than 10, 000,000 miles in a few days and its rapid disspersion. The tail Materally* from the concentration of debris driven out of the comet by the sun’s heat, then strewn over an area in the orbital plane.

When viewed at an angle, Dr. Whipple reports in Nature (June 15), the material could not be observed easily, However, when seen edge-on, as it was when the Earth passed in the plane of the comet’s orbit on April 25, the material showed up clearly as a line of considerable intensity,

The sunward jet of Comet Arend-Roland 22 cloped from a diffuse fan-shsape* on April millions of miles on April 25. By April 29, the jet disappeared because the particles had too far apart to be seen after the earth moved out of the plane of the comet’s orbit.

Dr. Whipple reports that the fine debris 

spread out into the plane of the orbit and seen as the sunward tail was ejected from the comet’s central part or nucleus.

Coments* are believed to be a swarm of small and widely separated solid bodies held loosely together by mutual attraction, a flying gravel bank paying a brief visit to the sun’s vicinity.

RADIO ASTRONOMY

Watch Radio Waves From Comet Rivaling Halley's

> THE COMET Arend-Roland predicted to rival or outshine Halley's in brightness is being scanned for radio waves. (See p. 251.)

The Government's largest radio telescope, a sensitive, 50-foot antenna at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, is tuned in at a frequency near 1667 megacycles, and aimed at the comet's expected position in the sky.

The Naval Research Laboratory scientists are looking for the "hydroxyl" group, OH, in the comet's tail. This group has been seen optically in comet tails, and is predicted to emit radio waves at about 1667 megacycles. If the hydroxyl is found, it will be the first time that its radio waves have been detected from any heavenly object.

Comet Remains Visible

Bright comet shares honors in the sky with four planets. A fifth planet, Mercury, will be visible as it crosses the sun’s surface on May 5, one of 14 transits this century.

By JAMES STOKLEY

> AREND-ROLAND COMET, most con- spicuous visitor of this kind since 1910, which came into view in mid-April, may - still be seen in the western sky on May evenings (See p. 249).

Rapidly drawing away from the sun, it is fading in brightness and by the end of May it will no longer be visible to the naked eye. To see it then it should still be possible to pick it up with a pair of binoculars.

At the beginning of May the comet will be in the northwest, just above the constel- lation of Perseus, between the bright star Capella and the W-shaped group of stars marking Cassiopeia.

After that it will move up toward Ursa Major, the great bear, passing to the left of the dippers (these two stars in the great dipper which indicate the direction of the pole star) during June.

The path is indicated on the accompanying maps, which show the brighter stars and planets as they will appear about 10:00 p.m. y our own kind of standard time in the mid- dle of May, and hour earlier in the middle of the month, and two hours earlier at the end.

Other Bright Planets

In addition to the comet, two planets will be shining brightly’ during May even- ings. A third will be seen only low on the whole toward the end of the month, hug- ging low in the west as the sun closes.

Jupiter is the brightest of these. It stands high in the south, a little east of the me- ridian as the sun sets on May 1. After that it remains bright right through the month. Jupiter, of magnitude minus two on the astronomical brightness scale, is in the eastern edge of the constellation of the lion, between the bright star Regulus and Virgo, the virgin.

Saturn, the second planet, considerably fainter, but still comparable to a bright star, is low in the southeast, in Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer.

The third planet is Mars, to the northwest j of Gemini, the twins. This planet has now  |   faded so far away that it resembles a star and will be small and indistinct unless a telescope makes it gleam better.

Venus, the fourth planet, is just shown on the map. on May 1, it passed behind the sun and will be, therefore, invisible. By May it will have emerged on the far side of the sun that it will remain above the

horizon for nearly half an hour after sun- set, and will still be difficult to see.

By the end of May, almost an hour will elapse after the sun has gone down before Venus follows. Then, perhaps, you may be- gin to get a glimpse of the planet, very low in the west, at dusk.

Brightest May evening star is Vega, in Lyra, the lyre, in the northeast sky. Be- tween it and Cygnus, the swan, is the star Deneb, another body whose light is dimmed because of its low altitude.

High in the south, around Jupiter, are several bright stars. To the right is Regulus, part of Leo. This star, is in a smaller group called the Sickle, with Regulus at the end of the handle, which points downward. To the left of Jupiter, in Virgo, stands the bright star of Spica.

Above, to the bear-driver, Arcturus is the brightest star in this group.

Low in the southeast, near Saturn, is another star of the first magnitude, Antares, in Scorpius, the scorpion. This, too, is greatly dimmed because it is so near the horizon.

Low in the west are a few of the bright constellation of winter, now making their last stand before they disappear for the summer months. There are Castor and Pollux in Gemini, the group in which Mars appears. To the right are Auriga, the charioteer, with Capella. Canis Minor, the lesser dog, stands to the left, with Procyon as its brightest star.

Of the five planets that are ever visible to the naked eye, four will be seen, though perhaps with a little difficulty, during May. Mercury is the only missing one. The fifth is Mercury, and although it will not appear in the evening sky, it will also

be visible during the month—but visible in a peculiar way.

Mercury circles around the sun once every 88 days, called its sidereal period, that is its period of revolution with respect to the distant stars. However, it takes a longer time to catch up to the earth.

Between that sun and earth date, Mercury is twopence owed around us. By the time it has made one revolution, 88 days later, the earth has moved nearly a quarter of the way around its orbit. Consequently, it takes 116 days, which is called its synodic period, he able to see it again in the same direction from the sun in conjunction with the sun, as it is called. A few weeks before it gets there it has been to the east of the sun, and after it has managed to be west, before sunset, and after sunset.

Generally after each conjunction, Mercu- ry does not come precisely between sun and earth, but rather it is north or south of the line from our planet to the sun. But during the many few occasions try, it can pass right in front of the sun, as we view it, producing what is called a transit.

Transit of Mercury

Such an event occurs on May 5. It will take about two hours for the planet to pass completely across the solar disc. From the northern part of noon in the United States, it cannot be seen. Out of the east of the country, the sun will set well where the transit is just beginning. In the far west the transit will pass We but visible for the entire term.

Mercury is much smaller than the sun, and at the time of the transit, appears only about 1/160th of the same. Meansol tiny that it cannot be seen, as it crosses sun’s face, without some telescope aid. The changing formation of text May

Of course, one should never look at the our directly—particularly not with a tele May 4 observer to be sure about proper

SCOPE—AND SPECIAL ATTACHMENTS ARE PROVIDED for telescope eyepieces to enable one to make solar observations without danger. Also, when a telescope is pointed to the sun, its image may be projected on a sheet of white paper placed a little distance in back of the eyepiece.

With aids such as these, amateur astronomers all over the country may be busy watching the sun on the evening of May 5 to see Mercury crossing it.

Transit’s Time Schedule

In New York the planet will start to enter the disk of the sun at 6:56 p.m.,EST, just as the sun is about to set. St. Louis will see the beginning of the transit at 5:56 p.m., CST, and at 6:06 CST the planet will be fully in front of the sun. Astronomers around San Francisco will be watching the transit of the planet on the sun’s 
disk between 3:57 and 4:47 p.m., PST. At about 5:14 PST Mercury will be nearest 
the sun’s center. At 6:19, in the Bay area, 
the planet will start across the sun’s edge
again, and at 6:27 PST the transit will be over.
 
Mercury will be moving from east toward the west so its passage across the sun will be downwards. The whole transit will occur toward the right-hand edge of the sun or between two and three if you think of the sun as a clockface. 

During this century there are 14 transits of Mercury, four of which are grazing contacts—entering but not leaving. The last transit occurred Nov. 11, 1953, but the last full transit at this time of year was on May 7, 1937; the next will occur Nov. 7, 1960, and the next May transit on the eighth in 1970.

Only Venus and Mercury can undergo transits, since they are the only planets nearer the sun than the earth.

Transits of Venus are far more rare, and there is none in the 20th century. The last happened on Dec. 6, 1882, and the next will occur on June 8, 2004. 

Since Venus is considerably larger than Mercury, as well as nearer to the earth, of the two the transit it can be seen in front of the sun without the aid of a telescope.

With smoked glass or other suitable protection for looking directly at the sun, 
Venus can be seen as a dark, round spot, moving slowly across the bright solar disk.
On May 13 there will be a total lunar eclipse, as the moon passes through the earth’s shadow. It will be visible generally in Europe, Asia, Africa and over the Atlantic Ocean but will end 6:10 p.m. EST, before moonrise in the eastern U.S. and Canada.

However, the moon will remain partly in the earth’s shadow until 7:17 p.m., and by then it will have risen for some points along the Atlantic Coast.

People at these locations may notice, just after the moon appears, a curious shading of its upper edge, where it has not yet emerged into full sunlight.
