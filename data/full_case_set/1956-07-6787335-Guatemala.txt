REPORT NO.: IR-59-56                 EXTRACT "A"             UNCLASSIFIED        
                   "LUMINOUS OBJECT IN THE FORM OF CIGARETTE"
                       SAID TO HAVE BEEN SEEN"

Mr. Manuel G. Leal V., teacher of primary school, affirms having witnessed on the night of last Sunday, together with his brother, "a luminous object in the form of a cigarette, circulating across the sky at rather high speed", and connects this with what several police agents of Escuintla state about having seen flying saucers. 

Professor Leal, who lives in Santa María de Jesús, department of Sacatepéquez, points out that "the object emitted light flashes of a pale red color from behind, and rose towards the North until it was out of sight. As I live near the National Airport I discard the possibility that it might have been a plane", says Mr. Leal.
