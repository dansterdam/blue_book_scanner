AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight No.: Williston FLBRID (B)

By the account of the observer, the following is a true report for the following incident:

On 01/09/55 at 01/01/52 over Williston, Florida, the witness observed an unidentified object in the sky.

The witness stated that he had observed the object to be circular in shape and larger than his aircraft with lights along the perimeter. The object was observed from 01/01/52 to 01/01/32 and appeared to be traveling at a very high rate of speed.

Information gathered from the 4602d Air Intelligence Service Squadron indicates that the sighting was of an aircraft from Eglin Air Force Base that was conducting a training exercise on the night in question. The possibility exists that it too may have been a refl re-refueling operation.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
Concur with the opinion of the preparing officer that the sighting was most likely caused by the SAC air-to-air refueling operation.

RC CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
SOURCE: DIR "World of Flying Saucers"

31 October 1955
Florida (Gainsville)

A flight of bombers refueling in mid-air at night can be a startling sight, more than once has been reported as a gathering of flying saucers. Such an incident occurred in Florida on October 31, 1955, when a disk jockey at Gainesville broke into his radio program about ten o'clock in the evening to announce that flying saucers had been sighted. Hundreds of persons hurried out of their homes to look at the Halloween visitors, clearly visible in the night sky. One reporter stated that he had seen four to six objects, where in glue, oblong in shape, traveling somewhat in a straight-line formation that later changed to a v [sic]. Both the radio station and the police station were swamped with telephone calls, most of whom were the people who had seen the objects and could not explain what they had witnessed. A flight of bombers had been refueling at an altitude of some feet, and the result was a startling sight to those unaccustomed to such a display.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE GAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO EACH QUESTION ASKED AND APPEARED TO BE HONESTLY AND SINCERELY DESCRIBING WHAT WAS OBSERVED. SOURCE WAS FAIRLY WELL KNOWN TO THE INVESTIGATOR, WHO CONSIDERS HIM RELIABLE.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
SOURCE'S STATEMENT: "I FIRST SIGHTED THE OBJECTS WHILE MAKING A ROUTINE PATROL CHECK AT APPROXIMATELY 1:25 A.M. ON 28 OCTOBER 1955. THE OBJECTS, EIGHT IN NUMBER, WERE FIRST NOTICED ABOUT 10 DEGREES ABOVE THE SOUTHERN HORIZON AND SLIGHTLY WEST OF SOUTH. THEY APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND ABOUT THE SIZE OF A QUARTER HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. THEY MOVED IN A HORIZONTAL DIRECTION AT A STEADY RATE OF SPEED, MAINTAINING THEIR RELATIVE POSITIONS TO EACH OTHER. THERE WAS NO SOUND OR VAPOR TRAIL OBSERVED. AFTER WATCHING THEM FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES, THEY GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED BELOW THE SOUTHERN HORIZON."
SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO ESTABLISH A MORE PRECISE DESCRIPTION AND OBTAIN ADDITIONAL DETAILS, BUT THE SOURCE COULD ADD NOTHING FURTHER TO HIS ORIGINAL STATEMENT. HE STATED THAT HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT WHAT HE SAW WERE NOT AIRCRAFT, SINCE HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE APPEARANCE OF ALL TYPES OF AIRCRAFT OPERATING IN THE AREA. AT NO TIME WAS ANY SOUND OR VAPOR TRAIL OBSERVED.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: ABOUT 10 MINUTES AFTER 22/0300Z, THE OBJECTS WERE AGAIN OBSERVED BY THE SOURCE, THIS TIME MOVING IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THEY APPEARED MUCH SMALLER THAN BEFORE AND WERE ONLY VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS. THE SOURCE STATED THAT ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT BE CERTAIN, HE BELIEVED THE OBJECTS WERE SEEN TO MAKE A SHARP, RIGHT-ANGLE TURN WHILE MOVING AT THIS HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE SOURCE STATED THAT AT NO TIME DID HE OBSERVE ANYTHING RESEMBLING CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FLIGHT DATA: 28 SEPT 1955

I. SOURCE: Name Deleted
Address: Ocala, Florida
Age: 25
Occupation: City Policeman
Education: High School

II. RELIABILITY: Source gave much thought to his answers: In the opinion of the investigator, it would be difficult to obtain more accurate data from this source.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

The first time I saw them, they were coming from the north, southeast with no visible means of propulsion. Some were light-gray in color and circular in shape, about 30 feet in diameter. Others were dark-gray or black, about 60 feet in diameter. They would dart, hover, and zig-zag at high speeds. When they would turn on their lights, which were of different colors, the lights would cut out completely at times, then come on again. At times, the lights would cut out completely, and the objects would seem to disappear. There was no engine or propeller sound. The objects would approach to within 500 yards, then back off rapidly. The sight lasted approximately 30 minutes.

Additional Information: SOURCE was fairly certain that the objects observed were more or less stationary and the apparent motion was due to the motion of the observer. The objects did not reflect the sun's light as would a metallic object, and they looked like dim lights. The objects did not appear to be aircraft, as they left no trail and made no sound.
When the objects first appeared, the source was on duty and driving a police car. The objects were sighted in front of and behind the car at various times. SOURCE estimated the size of the objects by comparing them to the dimensions of known objects in his field of vision. The length of time the objects were in sight would have covered the area within a 1/2 mile radius. The weather conditions at the time were as follows: clear sky, no wind, and cool.
SOURCE estimated that the speed of the objects were in the 700 MPH range.

II. ACCOUNT OF SIGHTING:
SUBJECT'S STATEMENT: "Upon talking over police radio, I proceeded to investigate a report of an unidentified flying object sighted over the Northeast Florida area. I saw what appeared to be a bright light, much brighter than any other star in the sky. It was stationary for a short time, then moved slightly to the north, and then moved to the southwest at a very fast rate of speed. It appeared to be round in shape and made no sound. I watched it for about 10 minutes, and then it disappeared from sight. There were no clouds in the sky at the time, and the weather was clear and dry."

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
Estimated time of sighting was about 1955 and estimated duration of sighting was about 10 minutes. The object appeared to be round in shape and very bright, much brighter than any star. It was stationary for a short time, then moved slightly north, and then moved to the southwest at a very fast rate of speed. The witness, a policeman, stated that he could not determine the size, distance, or altitude of the object, and that it made no sound. Weather conditions were clear and dry at the time of the sighting.
