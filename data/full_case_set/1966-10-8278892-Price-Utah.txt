Transcription of the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

This page does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a photo analysis report from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 67-12
DATE OF REPORT 28 FEBRUARY 1967
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION Price, Utah
DATE 7 April 1966, 8 October and 15 October 1966
PHOTOGRAPHY (6) 35 mm color slides, (6) prints (B&W)
QUALITY Poor
1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to a request submitted by Major Quintanilla (TDETR) to determine the identity of the object photographed.
2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the referenced color slides has shown the "unidentified objects" to be a result of an attempt at night photography with insufficient illumination of anything except silhouetted sources of light. Although the type of light sources has not been determined (i.e. street lights, interior lights etc.), it was found that the image pattern and distance separating the light sources on the 8 October and 15 October 1966 frames were identical.
3. Source stated that these were isolated or individual sightings, but the photography indicates a relative coverage of the same target or background photographed from a common point. Each exposure reveals a different shape for the light sources. This is a characteristic phenomenon resulting from camera movement during the exposure when the camera is hand held. The remaining two frames of 7 April and 8 October 1966, although different patterns of light sources, exhibit camera movement along.

The text reads as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 29 Oct 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Sketches and explanations are enclosed.

On April 7, 1966 I took two pictures, on Oct. 8, 1966 I took six pictures and on Oct. 15, 1966 I took six pictures each time within the time lapse film in my camera. With the naked eye the object looked about the same each time. However, the film in the camera developed images that have been developed differ somewhat from what I saw with the naked eye.

Can you explain the reason for this difference in the slides?

I am sorry that I do not have the original slides which I took on April 7, 1966 as I let someone have them just the day before I received this questionnaire. I am enclosing a copy of the original slide. I will have the original slide back at a later date.

The enclosed slides of the Oct. 8th and Oct. 15th sightings are the original slides.

I will appreciate your returning these slides when you are thru with them.

APR 6 1966

SAF-OICC/Mrs Cassel/bp/79079/11 MAR 67

APRIL 1 1967

Dear Mrs. *****,

Reference is made to your recent unidentified flying object (UFO) observation and the photographic which you submitted.

Photographic analysis revealed the following: Examination of the submitted color slides has shown the unidentified objects to a result of an artifact within the photographic film. Identification of everything except several sources of lights. Although the object was determined to be a light source, it could not be identified as to the type, size, shape, etc. The light sources on the October 8 and October 15, 1965 frames were identified.

The photograph indicates a repetitive coverage of the exact same target on subsequent photographs from a common point. Each exposure reveals a different shape for the light sources. This is a common phenomenon which is caused by two long exposures when the camera is hand held. The resulting frames are April 7 although showing a different pattern of light sources, exhibit camera movement also.

The description of your visual observation is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. To obtain a photograph of an astronomical body requires high speed film and a tripod to prevent camera movement. Your slides are enclosed; thank you for submitting them for analysis.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.

UFO Seen Over Price

Reports of UFOs (unidentified flying objects) are not confined to Wasatch Front areas. Such sightings also have been reported in the Price Area.

Mrs. Ann Anella, who lives a mile southeast of Price, reported seeing a lighted object in the air first on Sept. 1, then again on Sept. 22. She reports the object, appearing to be like a shining light, was traveling southward.

Mr. Hector Quintanilla, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
Wright-Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

This letter is concerning unknown objects. I sighted the objects over Price, Utah. They were very bright and looked to me like I did not know if they were flying objects or something else so I thought I would write and tell you what I saw.

I took some pictures but I wish I had gotten more, as I got only two. I wanted to be sure that I had gotten something so I took two to be sure that I had gotten something. I want to be sure you could see them. I have the slides developed and could send them to you if you are interested. The shape and size was a little different and did not look like a regular plane. The lights I saw were about three of them, different size or different brightness, shaped different. The lights come over our city by different people at different times, after I have taken these slides.

If these slides would be of any help to your government in their "Project Blue Book", I have no idea what these things are, but I have a feeling I would very much like to know what they are, being sighted for the people not to know what they are.

If these slides are of interest to you, I would appreciate hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,
