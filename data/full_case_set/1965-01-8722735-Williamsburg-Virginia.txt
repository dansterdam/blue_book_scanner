As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"1. One notable meteorological condition that may have contributed to the sighting is the unusual weather pattern stated that heavy overcast clouds from the north prevented a full moon on the night of the incident. A descending balloon would have appeared very similar to the observed object.

2. The observer reported his sighting lasted 20 minutes 4 seconds. After first observing it, he watched it for 10 minutes before it went behind a cloud. After finding no clues that it was an aircraft, it was assumed to be a balloon. No aircraft were found in the area.

3. As the descent of the object was not observed, it would be difficult to determine that it was an aircraft. The lighting around the Williamsburg airport may have given the impression the it was nearer, and higher, than it actually was.

4. A check was made with the FAA facility at Richmond by Colonel, and no flights were reported at the time of the sighting.

5. This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert Eazor, 1st Lt USAF Langley Air Force Base, Virginia (63-13), Logan C. Brooks, Civilian, Project Blue Book," and provides no additional information that would cause me to conclude anything other than what is stated by the document.

WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA
23 JANUARY 1965

AT 0639, 23 January 1965, observer first noticed object appear from behind trees and move in a southwesterly direction. The object was first sighted at about 30 degrees above the horizon and was observed for approximately 7 to 10 minutes. It was a very fast moving object with no visible means of propulsion. The observer said it traveled at least 45 degrees in 3 to 4 seconds and was at times extremely bright, as though reflecting sunlight. The object finally disappeared to the southwest.

COMMENTS

The observer was a very reliable person who was interviewed by the writer. His description of the object was extremely clear and accurate. He stated that as object was hovering there was a "hazy look" to it. As object was moving, it had a "missile-like appearance." Size of object was estimated to be approximately the size of a basketball at arm's length.

Due to the high reliability of the observer and the excellent description of the object, it is considered that the object was a solid object and not an astronomical body or aircraft. However, no positive identification could be made. The cause of the reported object remains unknown.

Since no conclusive evidence can establish the identity of the observed object, the case is left unidentified and no positive conclusion can be drawn at this time.

Langley Team Investigating
UFO, But Report Unlikely
By TROY WILLIAMS
Daily Daily Mirror Writer
Washington, Jan. 7 - The Air Force Office of Special Investigations is now responsible for investigative the phenomena of "unidentified flying objects" (UFOs), Project Blue Book was discontinued last year.
This was disclosed to newsmen Saturday by Project Blue Book Director Maj. Hector Quintanilla. The colonel said that the AFOSI had assumed responsibility for UFO investigations about two weeks ago.
Project Blue Book was the Air Force's official agency for recording and analyzing UFO sightings and reports. It was discontinued on Dec. 17, 1969, after about 22 years of operation.
Quintanilla said Monday the closing action came after a review of the volume of sightings which had decreased in recent years. He said about 12,000 cases had been investigated by Project Blue Book in the almost 22 years of its existence.
The spokesman said there had been a gradual decrease in the number of sightings in the last few years and "a number of cases that were just plain hoaxes." He claimed the validity of many of the reports was in question.
Quintanilla said that Langley Air Force Base in Virginia is now handling the investigations of UFO sightings and reports. He said the AFOSI has assumed this responsibility and will conduct the probes as part of its overall security mission.
He added that any "hard evidence" such as parts of a UFO or unusual materials would be turned over to the Air Force's Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio for analysis.
As for the possibility of releasing official Air Force files on UFO investigations to the public, Quintanilla said "there are no plans" for such action. He said the files would be available only to authorized government agencies under the Freedom of Information Act.
