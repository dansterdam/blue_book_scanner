Text transcribed from the image:

Dear Sirs:

On Monday night, December 5, 1960, about 8:40 P.M., Mrs. Herman called my office and told me that a curious red object was in the sky over the college. I immediately went out to investigate and found that the object was a bright reddish-orange light hovering over the college. It was about the size of a quarter held at arm's length. It remained stationary for about 5 to 7 minutes, and then began to move slowly in a southeast direction. As it moved, it dimmed slightly. We estimated the height of the object to be several hundred feet above the college.

After it had been traveling in a Northeast-South direction for about a minute, a plane was seen in the area, coming from the Southwest. As the plane approached the object, the object suddenly accelerated and moved rapidly in an easterly direction, disappearing from sight in about 3 seconds. The plane continued on its course and did not appear to pay any attention to the object.

This is about all that I can report on this incident. We were able to contract the difference in the object's behavior when the plane approached, which seems significant. Let me know if you require any further information.

Sincerely yours,
Brother R. Herman
President

Verify what to wore seeing. Within a minute I had managed to look up and saw a lighted object coming over the building. It seem ed to get a little smaller as it came from the south, went over the building and the north. We all stood there trying to figure out just what the thing was. After it had disappeared from sight, about a minute and a half after I first saw it, it seemed to come back again. It was a slight distance lower and seemed to be moving a little faster. It was again coming from the south, passing over the building and off to the north. I don't think it seen quite coming so close the second time. The whole observation time was not over two minutes, I would say. As it seemed to disappear the second time, I took a deep breath and scratched my head, and I said to the others, "Well, did you see that?" And they all said, "Yes, we all saw it." I called the police station, but the sergeant who answered the phone said that no one had reported anything unusual in the sky. The object appeared to be about the size of a car, round or elliptical in shape. It made no sound and the motion was smooth and regular, not jerky or wobbling. When first seen it seemed to be about a quarter mile distant and its speed was faster than any aircraft I have ever seen from the school building. The school building is a two story structure, and the object was about the same height above the roof of the building as the building's height, if that would help give you an idea of the altitude. Needless to say I was greatly puzzled by the observation and it is something I shall always remember. I felt nothing at all unusual in connection with the sighting, no sense of fear or apprehension. I just wanted to get a good look at it and satisfy my curiosity as to what it might be. As I said before, there were three of us who saw it and we all agreed on what we saw. I thought I would report this to you, since I know your organization is interested in such phenomena. Please let me know if you would like any further details. About myself, I am a college professor and have been for many years. I would not want to have my name appear in writing this because it may be of some little value to you, and I would not want to appear in the role of a "crank" writer. If you wish, I shall be glad to talk this over with you by phone. Please let me know.
