FTD (DEPT)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433
8 September 1966

South Euclid, Ohio 44121
Dear Mr.
Reference your unidentified observation of 21 August 1966. Your sighting has been compiled and we believe you and others observed bright metallic satellites that are now known.

According to the Star Catalogue there are at least thirty-five thousand man-made satellites in orbit which were placed there over a period of time for which these satellites are visible. This debris constitutes what is often referred to as "saucer sightings". All space vehicles and components for these are quite familiar to the military and civilian astronomy observers.

Because of the large amount of space debris in orbit, it is difficult to determine the actual objects that were viewed.

Thank you for reporting your observation with detailed information.

Sincerely,
VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR. Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

1. Following incident reported to ATIC in a "FOIA" REQUEST was an unidentified flying object sited by the pilot of a USAF aircraft. On 5 August 1966, at 2230 hrs, near Pataskala, Ohio, an F-94 pilot observed an unidentified object on his radar. The object approached the aircraft on a constant course and then abruptly shot away from the aircraft at a high rate of speed.

2. Review of the sparse information available reveals indefinitely when under reported conditions of the United States Observatory unable to be caused by reflection or pilot's own aircraft from glint or glare instruments. Additional details on air mass many times gave with open.

There were no planes, helicopters, or satellites in the sky that I am aware of.
The object seemed to be propelled at an extremely high rate of speed.
I am not certain, but I think the object was metallic or at least had a light, metallic surface.
Regrettably, I did not observe it in detail long enough to provide a more complete description.
This sighting was somewhat frightening to me at the time, and I did not feel very rational about attempting to observe and analyze it in detail.
The object disappeared from sight so quickly, there was no time for me to gather any kind of scientific data about it.
I regret that I cannot provide more concrete information about this sighting that would be useful in identifying the nature of the object I observed.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points as discussed. My 12 year old son, called Ronnie, came home a week ago. He was out in the backyard with friends playing ball. He ran in the house very excited and said he saw a strange light in the sky which changed colors. He quickly called George, my neighbor, to come and see it. George said it looked very bright and changed colors from red to green to blue. He watched it for about 10 minutes. After that it sort of flashed or grew brighter and then went out of sight quickly. We watched for it again but did not see it return. My son was very excited and wanted to know what it was. I told him I did not know but it sounded like some kind of unidentified flying object. He seemed satisfied with this explanation. We have not seen the object again.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or is corroborative evidence of your sighting:

About 8:30 P.M. Observers were washing dishes and looking out the kitchen window, which faces west. They saw a bright light in the sky, quite high, and moving steadily from North to South. The light moved very fast and blew apart in flashes, like an explosion, momentarily disappearing and then reappearing, continuing on its course. The lights shifted towards the west, moving in a horizontal direction at a constant speed (not fast). They finally faded from sight.

The observers were certain this was not an aircraft, helicopter, or any known type of aerial vehicle. The movement and behavior of the light was very strange, unlike anything they had seen before. They were convinced it was some type of UFO.

Extracting the text from the document:

164
Secretary, Department
of National Defense,
Ottawa, Ont.
On August eighth, about 9:30
p.m. I observed an object in
the sky near my home.
Mr. Chisholm, Royal Canadian Air
Force, appeared to be in
agreement with my report. The
object was traveling for at least forty
minutes. I had checked the stars
for any comparison. It continued to
travel at the same speed until out of sight
(about right minutes). 
Since the main object was very
high and difficult to estimate its exact size,
I may have deemed it
should be reported accordingly.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten letter from someone in Springfield, Ohio dated September 9, 1966. The letter discusses a UFO sighting that the writer's son and a friend had witnessed the previous evening. The writer states that they called the local newspaper, the News-Sun, to see if anyone else had reported the sighting, but were told that no one else had reported anything similar. The writer goes on to describe the UFO they witnessed, stating that it was somewhat oval-shaped and bright in the sky, hovering and moving slowly before disappearing. The writer expresses uncertainty about what they saw, but is certain that it was not an airplane or any other known object.

Springfield, 45505, Ohio 
September 9, 1966

Dear Sir:
A friend of mine told me to write to this address in 
regard to the right persons what my son and I saw one evening
last week. My son and I as well as a neighbor who as I know
was therefore did nothing other than call the News-Sun to see if 
anyone else had reported a similar sighting. They were told that 
no such report had been made for Springfield Vicinity, but I 
assure no one else made a similar report because they did not include 
any information in the paper.

On Thursday evening, August 11, 1966, my 12 year old son and 
I were somewhat overcast and only a few stars high in the sky were
seen. As we looked to the west, a bright object in the evening 
horizon came to our attention and within about an hour the sky was 
very clear. Anyway, the object seemed to be perhaps over a mile 
distant and seemed to be and was hovering there and as we watched, 
it seemed to look for any oncoming cars a bright object took both
our attention and our son exclaimed "What is that?" there in the 
sky from our viewpoint, some 5 miles west of the Village lights at
Springfield our attention was drawn particularly to the manner in
which it seemed slowly to rise or lift from behind the Village lights 
to a point higher almost directly overhead. We watched it very closely
as to our view looked low, maybe about 15 degrees up. At the time
the evening light was fading so it appeared quite bright compared
to the growing object got to the point where it was almost over 
our heads and we noticed it was oval shaped with a central core and
glowing steadily, and the south end, we back side pulsating from
the direction we had first noticed it. We have a CB and I called
my husband as he could look out at the object, but he did not see
it on the othr end, so we decided to go back around the block to 
the point that we decided to leave, the object made a sharp 90 
degree turn and disappeared in the west. We could not see it after
that. However, we heard a faint whirring sound as if it took off
and seemed and sounding similar to the sound of your own model 
airplane on take off. The sound we have no other way to describe. 
There was no color, no clouds other than that.

I suppose I am reporting something you already are aware of, and it was an experimental craft night from the base itself. This was an experience for us and it was definitely something we have never seen before. Within a matter of minutes we saw another plane going North over our house which we would have been certain was the craft of the object when we became aware to look to my husbands attention. We hope this report will be of some small value to you.
Sincerely,

It appeared suddenly, as a satellite, floating across the horizon. We watched it carefully as it suddenly disappeared then reappeared about ten minutes later. It seemed to dart erratically, left our left, if we faced it, moments hesitation, and a flit to the right. Then, another hesitation, a dart to the left, the pattern continued for the object left our sight.
It was its motion, back and forth that attracted our attention.

Inquiries - Objects in the Sky at Night
Project 10073 Agency
Washington, D.C.

Although this inquiry may be misaddressed, please assist me in directing it properly.

I would like any information that might explain the following occurrence: 
On the night of August 15, 1962, this writer and a companion, while in the vicinity of the Cassidy Lake Trailer Park, located approximately 8 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., observed an unidentified object in the sky. It was stationary at first, then seemed to be moving, and finally remained stationary again. It gave off an intense white light, was quite large, and was observed for approximately 10 minutes. Its actions were noticed by several other people in the area, who stopped their vehicles to observe it. After the object remained stationary for a time, it suddenly blinked out and was gone.

I include with this letter a rough map, or chart, that may further elucidate the occurrence. Could your agency explain what we observed? Could you tell us what it was? We would appreciate any information you might be able to provide concerning this incident (to our knowledge) as there seems to be some related matters of which we are unaware. 

If you cannot supply this information, or venture a guess, then we might conclude that this letter is sincere, and that we feel your group that we describe as having a somewhat detached attitude, regards such matters as unimportant. We sincerely solicit your prompt reply.

Sincerely,

[ILLEGIBLE]

Several of the objects, which appeared to be lights, were seen about 8:30 p.m., shortly after the show opened, by Mr. Foster and other people. Mr. Foster said the objects were going at a "terrific speed" and were very high in the sky.
"A lot of people saw them and they don't seem to know what they are" said Mr. Foster. "They appeared to be moving very rapidly and in a peculiar fashion - very different from any known aircraft."
The objects were seen traveling at a high rate of speed, and changed direction several times, he added.
The first lights were seen going in a westerly direction. A short time later, the objects were reported moving in an easterly direction, and there were several of them this time. Then they appeared to be moving in different directions.
"There were four distinctly different objects in the group," he said. "They were unlike anything I've ever seen before."
Mr. Foster said some of the spectators saw the objects when they were looking up at the sky toward the end of the first act of the show.
"The objects made no sound," he said. "They traveled too fast to be conventional aircraft."
The objects were sighted again later during intermission, when many of the people saw them.

24 August 66

Conversation with 160th ARG Clinton County AFB, Ohio concerning sighting with probable cosmic contactor on 17 August 66 at approximately 2100-2200.

Conversation revealed the 160th ARG was scheduled to use the however, they had received a TWIX stating that the 97th RW at Stratwasle, 10 minutes prior to the break on the track. 

Contact was made with the 97th RW. They had 1,325 and 52 in took off at 1/4/62 from Williamsville ARB and proceeded to the southeast area. The aircraft would have definitely seen the UFO as it was about 30 miles west of Bardstown, Kentucky. A message was sent south of Bardstown. The aircraft from Longmont, Wyoming, New Hope, Kentucky, were approximately 15 miles north of Bardstown before making a turn that would take them around to the contact area.

KC-135 aircraft are equipped with a fuselage mounted wing 11.5 high which is turned on at various times to facilitate observer of the wings at night.

29 August 1966

Editor

Louisville, Kentucky 402

Dear Sir,

I have just received a newspaper article which appeared in your issue of 12 August 1966. The accompanying provided various descriptions of unusual lights observed by persons attending the Stephens Postage Stamp Convention.

As Assistant Chief of Project Blue Book, the Air Force office concerned with the investigation of unidentified flying objects, I have carefully examined the details contained in your article.

After having spent a full day in investigating, I offer the following comments:

There were a total of 13 B-52 and KC-135 bomber and tanker aircraft participating in a night refueling mission approximately 15-30 miles northeast of Louisville. These aircraft were participating in a night prefueling mission that occurred at the same time and in the same general area as the Stephens Postage Stamp Convention. Maneuvers of the jet aircraft could account for the various colored lights observed in this east-west direction south of Louisville.

A ground-light effect, which would have accounted for the "pulsating" feature of the lights, is believed to have been caused by the aircraft. These aircraft would account for those colors being observed.

During the mission, they definitely should have, since these aircraft were participating in the exercise. The distance would account for the various intensities of the lights.

Sincerely,
W. J. MARKEL, Lt Col, USAF
Asst, Chief Project Blue Book

Sept 9, 1953
Dear Sir:
May I please report that in regard to the unidentified object seen by my wife, Hazel, and myself, over our home here in Muskegon, on August 30, 1958.
This object first appeared in the east, about 8:45 p.m. and was visible for about 10 minutes, when it suddenly disappeared. It was a round, glowing object, about the size of a large dinner plate, and was in view at an approximate elevation of about 45 degrees. There was no sound accompanying it.
We had a very good view of it, and I have sketched it on the enclosed sheet as accurately as possible. We would be interested to know if any other reports of this or similar objects have been received. If so, we would appreciate any information you may have on such sightings.
Sincerely yours,
[Signature]

2 Hocking Countians Among Heavens
Sighting Big Fireball In Sky Over
A big fireball or meteorite was scene hike last night in parts of Ohio, and at least two Hocking Countians were among those who saw it.
Most of the sightings were in Hocking County, where hundreds of persons reported seeing the phenomenon and area newspapers received hundreds of telephone calls about it.
The fireball was sitting outdoors at 11:55 p.m. when he heard a sizzling or whistling sound and observed what appeared to be about 20 or 30 feet long. He said it was orange or reddish-orange in color and appeared to be dropping down slowly to a point with a white light at the narrow end. Several of those who saw it said it looked similar to a large sparkler and flashed out.
Donald Schultz, city fireman, was returning from Columbus where he had attended a fire school. He said he saw the big fireball near Lancaster at about the same time. Two other people in his car with him also saw it. He described it as brighter than Venus and shooting across the sky. Witnesses from northern Oho and Indiana reported seeing similar objects at approximately the same time. The Hocking County sightings were reported in a dispatch to the United Press International.

The image appears to contain a diagram and some instructions related to a UFO sighting report from Project Blue Book. The diagram shows a sketch of the sky with instructions on how to determine the location and motion of an observed object.

Transcribed text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
