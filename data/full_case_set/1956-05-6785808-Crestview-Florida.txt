The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a Project 10073 Record Card filled out with details about a UFO sighting that occurred on 7 May 1956 in Crestview, Florida. The record card includes information such as the date, location, type of observation, number of objects, source, length of observation, and a brief summary of the sighting. The conclusion section indicates that the sighting exhibited "erratic movement and disappearance, rising/falling indicative of balloon observation."
