The image does not contain any photographs, but rather includes sketches and diagrams related to reporting UFO sightings. The diagrams provide instructions on how to describe the observed objects and their movement.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

OCR Output:
34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 26 August 1967
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire are a narrative explanation of your sighting.
The sighting was quite bizarre. It could not have been a conventional aircraft. It had no lights, made no noise, and moved in a completely erratic fashion. It was oblong in shape and seemed to be metallic in construction. Its movements defied all normal modes of flight. After a period of observation it simply disappeared from sight.
