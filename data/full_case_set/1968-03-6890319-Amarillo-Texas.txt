DESCRIPTION: Major Hottinger stated that she left her residence at 2:00 a.m. Spring Street in Amarillo AFB where she is a nurse at the base hospital. She was driving north on Eastern St. when she observed an object in the sky which she first took to be a helicopter, but soon realized it was not. She watched the object as it hovered over Highway 287 when she first observed it. She slowed her car and stopped, and the object seemed to come closer to her car, at which time she could see it was a circular object about 50-60 feet in diameter with a red flashing light and white lights around the outer edge. She said she was absolutely amazed at what she was seeing. The object proceeded at a faster rate in a position where she could judge the size, and then it appeared to go straight up into the sky and disappear. She estimated the sighting lasted for about 10 minutes. Major Hottinger then drove to the service station on Highway 287, went into the service station and asked the manager, "Did you see that?" The manager said that he had not seen anything unusual. Major Hottinger then drove to the South Gate Guard House and asked the Air Policeman on duty, Alo Joseph P. Infantini, if he had seen anything unusual, and he said he had not. Major Hottinger then informed him of her experience and then proceeded to her quarters on the hospital.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with text describing a series of sightings that occurred during a 12-hour period over a distance of approximately 5 miles in a general East-West line. The text provides details on the weather conditions, timing of the sightings, types of aircraft observed, and other observations related to the sightings.

WEATHER CONDITIONS

A shallow inversion existed over the area this morning from surface to 1000 ft. Due 110 of a low cloud cover under this inversion, the sky was clear and variable. Sky condition, 10,000 high overcast visibility 15+. Temperature was 11° at 0000Z.

SUMMATION:

a. This series of sightings occurred during a 12 hour period over a distance of approximately 5 miles in a general East-West line. Times of the sightings being from 0530 to 0700.

b. A temperature inversion occurred in the sighting area during a closely corresponding time: 0530 to 0600.

c. Sunrise was at 0710 CST.

d. Aircraft in the area of sighting and bearing flashing lights and/or exhaust flames are as follows:

TYPE AIRCRAFT    TIME    DIRECTION OF TAKEOFF
Continental DC-9   0612   South
Electra   0613   South
Continental 210   0615   South
C-135-0720   0635-0720 South to Instrument Approaches  

e. All four descriptions vary either in size, color, shape, or sound.

f. No radar sighting or unusual objects were observed.

g. A low cloud cover related to the inversion lay Southeast of and parallel to the area of sightings.

h. The sighting occurred along a line paralleled on the North by lights from the city of Amarillo, Texaco Refinery and Amarillo AFB.

No contact was made by the object with ground, persons or property nor was any residue found. No evidence that the sightings were associated with the sightings.

Conclusions: Based upon the conditions and circumstances cited above correlated to guidance provided by the AF - University of Colorado Correspondence, it appears most likely that these sightings were perpetual distortions in the form of mirages created by the temperature inversion. The loud notice described by Major Holtoner cannot be identified but could have been from one of the aircraft operating near the point of sightings.
