E. The object, brightly luminous and appearing to be at least of 2nd magnitude, was passing on its axis and in the direction: South to North at 55° above the horizon, displacing at considerable speed and constant speed towards North/Northwest. Its speed was approximately that of Echo II.

There, I had asked the Good Lord in a prayer to see a flying saucer
And around 9 hours and 54 minutes, I was brutally thrown from my sleep by an unknown force. I was so afraid that I was shaking like a leaf. Upon waking up, I saw the dazzling object outside and acting on an interior solicitation, I was pushed to go to the window and I had visions, for example, on the forthcoming brutal disappearance of certain financial people by the Lady President of the United States.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten report or document page, likely from Project Blue Book, containing text in French.

L'objet signalé a l'aspect insolite d'un monument de 2 mètres de hauteur, de forme cylindrique, de couleur gris acier et d'une texture métallique.  Il aurait été aperçu par une Aude et dans la direction Nord à 55° environ. 

N.B. : Trois Heures au Paraissant, S'élevé lentement, puis fit une spirale descendante. Vers 18h54, il fit brutalement une montée vers le ciel. C'est comme un engin mû par une force inconnue.

The text appears to be a description of a purported sighting of an unusual cylindrical, metallic object, along with some details about its movement and trajectory.
