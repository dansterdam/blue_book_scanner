TO: DISTRIBUTION
1. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF AIR FORCE REGULATION 200-2, EVERY EFFORT MUST BE MADE BY ALL AIR FORCE UNITS AND PERSONNEL TO IDENTIFY AND CLASSIFY ANY AND ALL OBJECTS WHICH ARE OBSERVED IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH CANNOT BE IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIED. REASONS FOR THIS IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION ARE:
(a) TO DETERMINE THEIR ORIGIN, WHETHER NATURAL OR MAN-MADE, IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH INTELLIGENCE VALUATIONS ON THEIR SIGNIFICANCE, IF ANY, FROM A MILITARY DEFENSE STANDPOINT.
(b) TO ASCERTAIN THEIR ORIGIN IN ORDER THAT ANY AERIAL PHENOMENON WHICH MIGHT INDICATE A TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH BY A FOREIGN NATION COULD BE PROMPTLY IDENTIFIED AND EVALUATED.
2. WHENEVER SUCH OBJECTS ARE OBSERVED, AIR DEFENSE COMMAND AND EASTERN AIR DEFENSE FORCE MUST BE NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY OF THE DATE, TIME, DURATION, LOCATION, HEADING, SPEED, ALTITUDE, DESCRIPTION AND DEGREE OF MANEUVERABILITY OF THE OBJECT BY THE FASTEST MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AVAILABLE.
3. EVERY EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO SECURE ALL PERTINENT DATA ON UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS AND TO FORWARD IT IMMEDIATELY TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL, AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO, WITH INFORMATION COPIES TO HEADQUARTERS, AIR DEFENSE COMMAND, ENT AIR FORCE BASE, COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO, AND HEADQUARTERS, EASTERN AIR DEFENSE FORCE, HAMILTON AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA, ATTENTION: A-2.
4. ALL PERSONNEL ENGAGED IN THE IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS WILL BE INSTRUCTED TO SUBMIT THEIR REPORTS PROMPTLY AND TO INCLUDE ALL RELEVANT DATA OBTAINABLE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS BY THE AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER.
5. AN INITIAL OUTRIGHT DISBELIEF IN THE REPORTED PHENOMENON MAY OFTEN HANDICAP OR LIMIT COLLECTION OF VALUABLE EVIDENCE. IT IS BELIEVED SOME OBJECTS MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS OR POSSIBLE INTERFERENCE FROM MAN-MADE DEVICES.
