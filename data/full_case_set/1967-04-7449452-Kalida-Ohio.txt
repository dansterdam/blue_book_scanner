The image contains a compass-like diagram and a written instruction to draw a picture showing the motion of the object or objects observed, their path, and any changes in direction during the course. There is also a question asking how many objects were observed, if there was more than one, and a request to draw a picture showing their arrangement and the direction they were traveling.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curve line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
