STATEMENT

On the 22nd May 1955, three other airmen and myself were on the Denver highway coming back to the base for bad check when our car went out of gas. We pulled to a stop on a hill. About 10 miles from Cheyenne. We stopped a car on the highway and we told two of the other airmen to go get gas while Airman ____ and myself stayed with the car between 2400 hours and 0100 hours. I looked out of the right front window and I saw a funny looking object it was shaped something like a pencil with a white light all around it. The object remained for about 10 seconds then it disappeared and about one minute later it was there again, then there was a flash of light and there were two of them they started moving skyward and then they were gone. As soon as they were out of sight suddenly in the area they disappeared from three were two cone shaped objects they had a sort of white color at first then changed to a blueish purple color at first. Then as they moved skyward they kept getting brighter and I could see them glittering then they were gone from sight. Airman Shephard and myself just looked at each other, and I said I guess we should report it, so at 0730 Monday morning 23 May 1955 we reported what happened to M/Sgt Francis J. Martin. We were coming back from Greely on route 85 when this all happened.

STATEMENT

Last night on the 22nd of May, 1955 we were some what upset to the howls from Rocky. He was on point of the hill overlooking Cheyenne. Not far from his stance the 15th Air Force radar station. This is one of our reasons for checking into Cheyenne for the past several nights and to investigate the activity going on in the Cheyenne area. Rocky said the sounds were very similar to CO30, but didn't know what it was. I took a look out the window. It appeared to be a miniature and then suddenly, only this thing gave off two or three very bright lights - they were there for about two or three minutes, and then they disappeared completely.

A few minutes later, there appeared in the sky moving objects, two or three in number, these were the lights that seemed to be going up and then dropping almost straight down, moving south, flying not too high.

She was in sight for about two minutes, then it appeared almost straight up and toward the south.
