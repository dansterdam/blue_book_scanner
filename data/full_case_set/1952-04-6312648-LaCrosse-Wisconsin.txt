Attn:      TDPT (UFO)
Subj:      UFO Investigation
To:        Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, Jr.

Reference: I. Your letter 22 May 1968, subject: UFO investigation, on which you have listed, in the order they were listed.

1. 7 January 1952, Palmer, Alaska.
I have rated this case 26 C7, meaning that as far as strangeness is concerned, the final rating seems to have been 26 on a scale of 30. The report seems to come into the category of "cigar-shaped Ufos" reported from many countries and which have already been adequately explained. In this instance, there is not sufficient information for us to go on. The report we have states that an "Alaska Air Command informed stated will take further investigative action," and "additional data will be forwarded when available."
To this list of my knowledge the following data were never received.

2. 14 April 1952, LaCrosse, Wisconsin...

I originally asked to review this case in the hopes that unknown to me some additional followup had been made. I found that despite the fact that a Captain of commercial airline and others apparently observed this object, there is still no record of any further investigation.

had witnessed this, no followup whatever was made. It is that sort of thing at this time; and in a great many other cases that has led to the facetious, but somewhat deadly remark by someone that "Project Blue Book might as well be called Project Unexplained", (Ivan Sanderson's organization) but rather indicates a similarity to the Univeristy Society for the Investigation of the Unexplained since 1947, because of the incompleteness of the investigation of cases reported, since many cases were not adequately followed up. I had often pointed out that our efforts in Dayton and in Washington that a day or reckoning might some day come when the Air Force might be asked to show cause. In this case, for instance, no attempt apparently was made even to find out what was made known to them. How many other cases are incompletely investigated we do not know.

3. 4 June 1952, Stuttgart, Germany.
I have rated this a 2 3 C 6 meaning puzzling but possibly explainable case of good sighting. 6, since there were two witnesses technically trained. One witness was a Lieutenant Colonel who was shortly thereafter assigned to the Directorate of Intelligence, Headquarters, United States Air Force. It seems unlikely that they would have been militarily misidentification of an FW4, and reported this conclusion, fairly tight turns, and then have turned their own aircraft across misidentification on the part of these two experienced pilots; and therefore, it is unjustified, however, in the statistics for the year to until it is unquestioned, it cannot be fairly called an "unidentified". I have long inveighed against the unacceptable (and this is to say good statistics) statistics employed by Blue Book over the years in transforming "possibles" and "probables" into firm actualities.
