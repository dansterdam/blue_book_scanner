The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document, specifically a letter from the Chief Constable of Kent, dated 2nd October 1964, responding to a previous letter regarding a newspaper report about a UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

COPY.

2nd. October, 1964.

Dear Sir,
Thank you for your letter of the 25th. September, 1964. There is little to add to the newspaper report which you enclosed with your letter. The object observed was quite bright in appearance and was lost from sight at approximately 11.00 p.m. on the 23rd. September, 1964, within about 5 minutes. It was at a high altitude and moving steadily towards Essex. At no time was it possible to estimate its size or speed.

Yours faithfully,
Chief Constable of Kent.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document that is part of a Project Blue Book report.

REPORT TO THE U.S.A.F. BLUEBOOK PROJECT.

You will see from the enclosed U.F.O. and A.F.O. analyses the conclusion on the flight of the U.F.O. That the information as regards the sighting was sufficient to conclude that the object was seen (it's existence established) and an assessment could be made.

They main points of the incident in this case were that the object/objects were sighted over a longer period, they performed maneuvers on a significant scale and the conclusions arrived at were fully satisfactory.

I trust this additional communication and explanation is helpful. Please let me know if you need any further details.
