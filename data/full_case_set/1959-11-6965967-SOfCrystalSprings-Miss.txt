that after watching the object for the first two minutes, he became
so engrossed with it, that all his senses were at their peak, so he
could get a definite picture of events. Although the observer was
excited at what he saw he was keenly aware that nothing like it had
presented itself to his eyes before. He stated that he “would stake
his life” on the part and where the object halted in mid air, and that it
made no sound whatsoever.
