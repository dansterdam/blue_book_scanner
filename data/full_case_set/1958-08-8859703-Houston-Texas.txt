The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a document titled "PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD". The document appears to be a report form used for recording observations related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program established in 1952 to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text found in the document is as follows:
