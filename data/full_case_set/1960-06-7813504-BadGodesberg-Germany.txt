Nine separate round distinct white lights in triangular formation about 45 deg elevation. Luminosity brighter than 1st magnitude star. No sound. No trail. Object seen also with naked eye.
11. COMMENTS
One witness - insufficient data. The constellation was on the horizon at this time to the NW. The witness was looking over the Rhine river through binoculars. It is probable that a mirage of some sort was observed as the object was extremely distinct and the duration of the sighting extremely short.
