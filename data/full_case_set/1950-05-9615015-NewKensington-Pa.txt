```
P.S. - I haven't heard of any daylight observations. Let's hope they are U.S.A.F. A/C!

The Kirkwood Hotel
"IN THE HEART OF EAST LIBERTY"
COMPLETE STRUCTURAL RENOVATION OF 139 ROOMS - ALL WITH BATH
J. V. MARS
MANAGER

KIRKWOOD ST. AT WHITFIELD
EAST LIBERTY
PITTSBURGH, PA

MADE A SHARP RIGHT TURN - HEADED DUE WEST OF THIS TOWN. I DID NOT NOTICE ANY JET-LIKE EXHAUST FLAMES OR TRAILS. THIS ALL HAPPENED IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES. ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF A/C: 20,000 FT.

DURING PAST WEEK, SOME THREE OR FOUR FLYING SAUCER INCIDENTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THIS AREA (SPRINGDALE, TARANTUM AND ARNOLD, PA.) IN LOCAL NEWSPAPER.

MY PERSONAL GUESS: THESE A/C ARE BEING TESTED BY U.S.A.F AS RADIO-CONTROLLED AND INTERCEPTOR TYPES OF A/C TO DESTROY ENEMY A/C OVER U.S.A. INDUSTRIAL TARGETS.

Respectfully submitted
