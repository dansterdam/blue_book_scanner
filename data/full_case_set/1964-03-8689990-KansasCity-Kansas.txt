not as yet received an answer
reply on it. I'd appreciate it
very much if you would,
please send me copy of Air Force

AIRLINE PILOTS REPORT EXPLODING UFO
March 19 -- most extraordinary UFO report was issued by Pan American Airlines pilots and captain flying their N7797U jet near R.A. Bothtow.
Captain Morris was piloting an aircraft containing 42 passengers bound from London to New York, and Captain Botthoe was co-pilot on a flight of 25 passengers on an route from New York to Frankfurt.
Both observed a strange object traveling at high altitude on an apparent north to south trajectory, which unexpectedly exploded with an immense brilliance, parts of which were obscured with an immense brilliance, parts of which were obscured with columns of smoke.
Neither pilot has been able to identify the phenomenon.

Dear Mr. Stetka:
Thanks again for sending the file on the latest UFO sighting. I will get through to it shortly, and I appreciate your sending it along.
As I mentioned, I am interested in sighting data both old and new, and anything further you can provide will be most helpful. My ultimate goal, of course, is to increase the general public's awareness and knowledge of this subject, and the more material I have to work with the better.
The recent cases have been quite interesting, particularly the one where a "close encounter" allegedly took place. I would be most interested in any additional details you might be able to furnish regarding this incident.
Please send me a copy of the entire file, including any photographs, diagrams, or reports that may be associated with it.
I remain,
Sincerely yours,

ASTRONOMY

Brilliant Evening Star

Venus outshines all other planets and stars. The vernal equinox in March still begins the spring in the Northern Hemisphere. 

BY JAMES STOKLEY

* SHINING MANY TIMES more bril-liantly than any other star or planet now visible in the evening. Venus is becoming more and more conspicuous. Gaining in its gibbous phase day by day,it remains visible during March for about three hours after sundown.

Venus attains its greatest brilliancy on March 11, when it shines with a light about 44.4 million miles, but by the end of the month the distance has reduced to 37 million miles. This variation in distance causes the swings between sun and earth to mid-June.

At the beginning of March you will find Venus low in the west-southwest, rising and setting about 3 hours after the sun. By March 31, it will have moved considerably farther west, setting about 4 1/2 hours after the sun.

Although only about one-sixtieth as bright as the sun, Venus is at present the brightest object in the sky after the moon. If you will look for it by March 31, you will have to look high in the west, soon after sundown, to see it.

Venus attains its greatest brilliancy near the earth at mid-March and after that becomes less and less conspicuous, all through April, as it moves farther and farther from the earth and is lit less strongly by the sun.

Other Planets:
Mercury sometimes visible low in the west for a short time after sunset—but too close to the sun for comfortable observation. Mars, too, is too close to the sun to be seen easily.

Jupiter, the "big star", is part of Canis Major, the great dog. It is the brightest star in that region of the sky, and is still well up in the south and southwest as it gets dark.

Saturn, which is rising a bit earlier each night, is located in the southern sky as soon as Venus disappears from view in the west. Saturn is shining higher than Virgo, the virgin, and above them the brilliant Spica. Between Saturn and Spica hangs the bright star Arcturus and below them Regulus, in Leo, the lion. 

Still farther to the right (shown partly on the northern sky), swung north on its star is the brilliant Aldebaran. This star is reddish in color, and above Taurus, the bull, the Pleiades, with their six or seven conspicuous stars, make a bright cluster almost overhead.

High in the northeast you can see Ursa Major, the great bear, whose seven bright stars are familiar to most of us as the Big Dipper. Below the pointers, whose direction leads you to Polaris, the pole star, part of Ursa Minor the little bear.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for FEBRUARY 22, 1964
THE FIELDS
ENTOMOLOGY
Indian Insect
To Fight West Pest
CANBERRA, QUEENSLAND'S worst insect pest, a boring beetle that ravages forests in New South Wales, may be brought under control by an Indian insect parasite. The beetle, Sirex noctilio, is estimated to cost the Australian forestry industry between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000 a year. 
John Mann, director of the biological section of the Queensland Department of Forests, has returned from a four-month mission where he collected large numbers of a parasite wasp, Rhyssa persuasoria, to launch field trials in Queensland.
The parasite, a boring beetle, will be effective under Queensland conditions in bringing the Sirex borer under control, Mann believes. They will be released in the Forestry Department's Sherwood laboratory, where they will be held to complete their life cycle, then liberated in the field. They will be ready for field tests which will begin this year.
ENGINEERING
Improved Traffic Flow
Can Save Many Lives
MORE THAN 23,000 LIVES could be saved each year if rational controls were applied to street and highway systems, traffic engineers believe. Much of the traffic congestion on city streets, overcrowding of certain streets and roads, and the resulting accidents, deaths and delays could be prevented through proper application of traffic engineering principles.
Efficient flow of vehicular traffic on streets and roads is essential to the economic life of a city. It contributes to saving time, energy and expense for both individuals and the community as a whole. Many a city has lost industry or seen its growth hampered by inadequate and congested traffic arteries.
But better vehicle design will only partly reduce the drag and congestion. What is needed is the application of advanced traffic engineering know-how.

AT 1:25 A.M.

IT WAS IN THE NORTHWEST AND SEEMED TO HOVER COMPLETELY MOTIONLESS AND LOOKED LIKE A UFO WAS FLYING OVER NEAR WHEN FIRST OBSERVED. THEN IT SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR FOR TWO SECONDS AND REAPPEARED LOWER IN THE NORTH. NORTHEAST HOVERING MOTIONLESS STILL LOOKING LIKE A WING-LESS AIRCRAFT, THEN IT VANISHED. IT HAD NO CALL MADE NO NOISE, WAS CIRCULAR DURING AND CAME TO WITHIN 50 YARDS OF MY HOME. IT SEEMED TO HAVE AN INTERESTTENT FOCUSED BEAM ON WHOLE AIRPORT ALWAYS KEEPING IT WITHIN ITS RADIUS CIRCLE OF LIGHT. IT LIT UP LIKE MAGNESIUM OR FLARE. IT WAS THE SIZE OF GRANDFATHER AND GRANDMOTHER. IT WAS THE SIZE OF A PEANUT OUT OF THE SHELL AS SEEN FROM MY HOME 3701 N.W. 1ST STREET, MIAMI, FLORIDA 33126.
