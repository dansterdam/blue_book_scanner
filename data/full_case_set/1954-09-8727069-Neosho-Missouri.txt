SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object at Neosho, Missouri
DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS. 
DOD DIR 5200.10

1. DETAILS: A special agent in charge, Little Rock. Arkansas, Field District Office, OSI, USAF, appeared and submitted a written report to the Effect that at approximately 9:35 P.M. CST, on 8 September 1954, he observed an unidentified flying object over Neosho, Missouri.

2. The report states that the object was observed for approximately 5 minutes. It appeared and seemed to be suspended in the air, with its lights on. The object then moved in a northwesterly direction at a high rate of speed. The object was described as large. estimating its diameter to be 10,000 to 12,000 feet. The military personnel who observed the object were with the 81st Fighter Interceptor Squadron, and considered as experienced observers. The contents of this report are set forth below.

"Seconds and seldom err more than plus or minus 10%. It required about 6 seconds to stop and I observed the object intermittently during this short interval. It had a split rolling motion but never more than 90 degrees. The first counter-clockwise, then the reverse. Under our making the first loop and the second counter-clockwise, the reverse, and back similarly around It seemed that the side presented to view had four undulations resembling steps. I do not underistand [sic] the significance but believe they were there. No details as to whet really gave the impression of the rolling motion. During the span of the first 6 seconds, speed of the object was approximately linear lively, being 6 to 8 times its own diameter per second. and also increased its speed and by the time it reached the secob d loop (seconds 1-12). The speed of the object, it seemed that the side presented to view had four undulations resembling steps. I do not understand [sic] the significance but believe they were there. No details as to what really gave the impression of the rolling motion. During the span of the first 6 seconds, speed of the object was approximately linear lively, being 6 to 8 times its own diameter per second. and also increased its speed and by the time it reached the second loop (seconds 1-12) its speed had increased to approximately 20 to 30 times its own diameter per second and also maintained the edge-wise view. The object disappeared over a mound, clearing it first-observed size, and during the fleeting glimpse I had of the top-up-bottom, there was possibly a projection somewhat resembling a cabin or control section. I consider this observation at this time of day made such an observation of little value. After seeing the object loops at seconds 1-12, I spent some time increasing still further both transversely and receding, and was convinced that this was a completely unfamiliar object. There was no information that I could obtain that would be strictly determined because of the lack of incoming traffic while observation was in progress.

CONCLUSIONS
"For what they may be worth, this reporter submits the following conclusions regarding the above observation:
"First, occupants of the object decided to ascend to heights beyond visibility when their presence was being observed. It is likely that other factors, such as radar are established, and there may have been other reasons for their mode of departure as there was no work[ing] on the Camp Crowder reservation.
"Second, means of propulsion of the object was some form of power not generally known, probably would, because of the sudden acceleration and terrific speed developed."

Third, the object did not depend on air for support or guidance, because the length of seconds 11-12 and 21-22 were too short for air-supported daylight. That is, unless the object was considerably smaller.

This reporter recognizes that the suddenness of the occasion for the observation and the lack of means for establishing true distance and size make this observation of doubtful value, but it may lead to more substantial investigation.

2. The evaluation of this report has been placed at F-18, since it is impossible to properly evaluate the information without further interview of Mr. KELLY.

3. ACTION: Copies of this report with inclosure have been furnished the Commanding (General, Air Material Command.

4. This report is classified CONFIDENTIAL pursuant to authority contained in Paragraph 22a, AFR 205-1.

SUBJECT INTERVIEW WITH LOUIS STEPHENS D.O.B. 8 OOTOBER 1910 
PLACE OF BIRTH NEOSHO, MISSOURI
OCCUPATION PHARMACIST 
DATE OF INTERVIEW 8 SEPTEMBER 1954
PLACE OF INTERVIEW NEOSHO MUNICIPAL BUILDING

GIVE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF SUBJECT'S ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT AS RELATED DURING THE INTERVIEW.

ON THE NIGHT OF 6 SEPTEMBER 1954 AT APPROXIMATELY 9 PM SUBJECT WAS DRIVING WEST ON HIGHWAY 71 ABOUT 2 MILES WEST OF NEOSHO, MISSOURI. SUBJECT OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE WESTERN SKY WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE AN AIRCRAFT IN DISTRESS. THE LIGHT WAS HOVERING AND OSCILLATING AND SEEMED TO BE EMITTING A WHITE BEAM OF LIGHT. SUBJECT DROVE ON A SHORT DISTANCE AND STOPPED HIS CAR TO OBSERVE THE LIGHT MORE CLOSELY. HE ESTIMATED THE LIGHT WAS ABOUT 400 YARDS AWAY AND AT AN ALTITUDE OF 300-400 FEET. SUBJECT WATCHED THE LIGHT FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES AND THEN IT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW TO THE SOUTH. SUBJECT STATED HE COULD HEAR NO SOUND FROM THE OBJECT. SUBJECT REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE NEOSHO POLICE DEPARTMENT WHO IN TURN NOTIFIED THE 822ND AC&W SQUADRON AT ARMY AIR BASE, SPRINGFIELD, MISSOURI.

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the image:

fleeting glimpse I had of the top side, there possibly was a protruding something removable.
the coming toward me of a submarine. The speed with which things were happening and the
acceleration of lighting at this time of day make such an observation of little value.
after controlling the object 1659 at seconds, same as before, both transversely and pacing,
and at seconds 24 it had become completely invisible.
There was no sign of smoke or vapor emanating from the object, nor was there any sound,
but this could not be strictly determined because of the noise of oncoming traffic while
observation was in progress.

CONCLUSION:
For what they may be worth, the following conclusions are submitted:
1. The object was saucer-like in shape, appeared silver or white and illuminated from within.
2. Its speed was far in excess of anything seen here of a conventional nature and other 
characteristics of the object tend to bear out this high speed appearance.
3. The length of the sighting, from first to last glimpse, was from 11-12 and 31-32 seconds,
which was too short for any meaningful study unless the object was considerably smaller than
it appeared.
This factor indicates that the witness's estimate of its size may have been in error.
4. The fact that the object did not deviate on air for any distance or guidance indicates
that it was almost certainly controlled by an intelligence.
5. There are certain technical facts, in the witness's observation, that the fullness of the
description would tend to discount the probability of an hallucinatory experience.

In summary, this report contains some substantial information, but is admittedly inconclusive
as to a final determination of the nature or identity of the object observed.
