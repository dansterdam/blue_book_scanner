The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be an "Air Intelligence Information Report" from the 136th F-8 Wing Intelligence, dated May 22. The report discusses meteoric activity and weather balloons, noting that there has been no increase in sightings of unidentified phenomena in recent months. The report is classified as "UNCLASSIFIED".

D/I FFAP COMMENT:

1. A check with Japanese observers has shown no increase in meteorite activity and no sightings of unidentified phenomena in recent months. 

2. Air Weather Service normally launches lighted weather balloons at night - reports of "lighted weather balloons" together with physical limitations of night vision might account for such reports.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
15 May 1952

STATEMENT

At 2200 hours on 8 May 1952 while steering due north to Misawa Air Base, I observed a flash of light at overhead. The flash lasted for approximately 2-3 seconds starting with a broad greenish-blue streak and ending in a puff of orange-red flame. The light first appeared at approximately 030° to my starboard and moved downward slightly from my port to starboard.

Previous to this flash of light I had been observing (for approx 2 min.) a flashing white light which appeared to be on the horizon and in the same direction as the light I saw overhead. After observing this light I flew north of Misawa Air Base on the coastline to a point approx. 30 miles north of the base looking for any remains of the flashing light previously seen. While doing this I was in contact with the GCI controller and upon pancaking I made a verbal report to him of what I had observed.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an official Air Intelligence Information Report, which describes a sighting of a bright light in the air by pilots flying near Misawa Air Base in Japan on May 8, 1952.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:
AT 2200 HOURS ON 8 MAY 1952 WE WERE FLYING NORTH ALONG THE COAST LINE ABOUT A MILE SOUTH OF MISAWA AIR BASE. THE PILOTS CALLED MY ATTENTION TO A SIGHTING WHICH WAS ON THE SURFACE OUT AT THE ONE O'CLOCK POSITION. I WAS WATCHING THIS, TRYING TO SEE IF IT HAD ANY CODE SEQUENCE WHEN I SAW THIS STREAK OF BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE AIR AND AT OUR ALTITUDE (7000 FT), WHICH WAS OUT AT THE SAME BEARING AND CLOSING (I ESTIMATE) 6 DEGREES. IT WAS MOVING IN A PATH OF A CIRCLE, SLIGHTLY TOWARD US, MOVING IN AN EASTERLY TO A WESTWARDLY DIRECTION. WHEN FIRST SIGHTED IT HAD A BRIGHT GREEN COLOR WHICH CHANGED TO YELLOW THEN TO AN ORANGE COLOR, AND DIED OUT OF SIGHT. AS THOUGH IT HAD DISINTEGRATED IN A PULSATING FASHION. IT JUST STOPPED, GOT VERY BRIGHT AND DIED OUT. ITS COLOR SEEMED TO LINGER RATHER THAN HAVE A TAIL LIKE A SHOOTING STAR. IT WAS FAST MOVING, BRIGHT AND OF SHORT DURATION. AS FOR ITS DURATION WHICH I COULD HARDLY ESTIMATE, IT DID LAST LONG ENOUGH THOUGH FOR ME TO SAY LOOK. LOOK. LOOK. TO THE PILOT OVER OUR LIVE INTERPHONE AND FOR HIM TO ANSWER. I COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING I COULD RECOGNIZE AS A SOLID MASS, ONLY AS LIGHT.
