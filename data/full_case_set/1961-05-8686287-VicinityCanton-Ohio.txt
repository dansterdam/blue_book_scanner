3:55P REPORT

I WAS WATCHING T.V. ABOUT 3:55 AND LOOKING OUT OF THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW WHEN I SAW A LIGHT OBJECT MOVING EAST TO WEST AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED ACROSS THE SKY. IT WAS SHAPED LIKE A CIGAR AND SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 3 TO 5 TIMES AS LONG AS IT WAS WIDE. THE LIGHT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT CAUGHT MY EYE AND WHEN I FOCUSSED ON IT I COULD SEE IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE, SATELLITE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IT WENT BY VERY FAST AND SEEMED TO LEAVE A GLOWING TRAIL BEHIND IT. I LOST SIGHT OF IT WEST OF THE HOUSE. THE ENTIRE SIGHTING LASTED ONLY A FEW SECONDS.

SUMMARIZED REPORT OF INVESTIGATION OF SIGHTING
OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT NEAR CANTON, OHIO
ON 8 MAY 1961

ON 8 MAY 1961, AT 2150 HOURS, AN UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY MRS. JOHN DOE AND HER HUSBAND IN THE VICINITY OF CANTON, OHIO.

THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED TO BE HOVERING 75 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, AND APPROX. 500 YARDS EAST OF THEIR RESIDENCE. THE OBJECT WAS DISCOID IN SHAPE, APPROX. 100 FEET IN DIAMETER, AND EMITTING A BRIGHT BLUE-WHITE LIGHT WHICH ILLUMINATED THE SURROUNDING AREA FOR 200 YARDS.

UPON CLOSER OBSERVATION, ROTATING LIGHTS OF RED, BLUE, AND AMBER COLOR WERE OBSERVED ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CRAFT. THE OBJECT REMAINED RELATIVELY STATIONARY FOR 12-15 MINUTES, THEN ACCELERATED RAPIDLY IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN APPROXIMATELY 10 SECONDS.

THE OBSERVERS REPORTED NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBJECT, AND NO EXHAUST TRAIL OR OTHER VISIBLE EVIDENCE OF PROPULSION SYSTEM.

THE SIGHTING IS CONSIDERED UNIDENTIFIED, AS NO CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT OR OTHER KNOWN OBJECT CAN BE REASONABLY EXPLAINED. THE SIGHTING IS CLASSIFIED AS A LEGITIMATE UFO REPORT.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

TO: Major Quintanilla
Subject: Project Bluebook

Date: 8 May 1961

Dear Sir:
Attached is a report of a UFO sighting in the vicinity of Canton, Ohio, on 7 May 1961. The witness is a reliable person in the community and his account appears to be credible. He states that he observed a stationary, round, metallic object for approximately 5 minutes at an altitude of about 1000 feet. The object then accelerated rapidly and departed the area.

I recommend that this case be considered for further investigation.

The image contains three sketches or drawings. The larger sketch on the left shows a curved line with an object above it and a horizon in the distance. The middle sketch shows a road or path leading to a distant horizon. The smaller sketch on the right shows a curved horizon line and an object or landscape feature.

In the field:

32. In the following search, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show the same curved line as it appears later.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was in when you first saw it, and a "B" to indicate where the object was in a later position when you observed it. Refer to another sketch on an example of this to complete the larger sketch.
