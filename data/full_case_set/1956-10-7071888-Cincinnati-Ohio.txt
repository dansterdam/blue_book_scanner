The image does not contain any photograph. The text appears to be a detailed report on a UFO sighting incident that occurred in Cincinnati, Ohio on October 7, 1956. The report was written by Thomas M. Comella and appears to be part of Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).

The text of the report is as follows:

EXCLUSIVE! For the last few months TRC has been extensively investigating the sightings of unidentified flying objects in the Cleveland-Akron, Ohio, area. We have reason to believe that these incidents formed one of the most comprehensive cases of its kind to be found anywhere.

On October 7, 1956, at approximately 7:30 P.M. EST, a number of witnesses near the Technical Intelligence Center at Wright Patterson Field, Dayton, Ohio, observed a strange luminous object maneuver over the area for approximately fifteen minutes. These unidentified flying objects are controlled by extra-terrestrial intelligence according to our information.

On this occasion, the object was sighted by several witnesses north on Kauffman Road in Cleveland. The object was described as being approximately 50-60 feet in diameter, luminous, and disc-shaped. Its maneuvers were erratic, at times hovering, and at other times traveling at tremendous speeds estimated at 2,000 mph. Its movements were observed to be absolutely silent. The military and Air Force officials at the scene were greatly excited and perplexed by this strange phenomenon.

I phoned my report to other investigators in the area with whom we had been working. This is the first comprehensive report we are making public. The conclusions drawn from this investigation will be presented in a later and more complete report.

The incident was also witnessed by Mr. Al Roush, who lives in South Euclid, an eastern suburb of Cleveland. Mr. Roush stated that he was awakened about 7:30 P.M. by a brilliant light in his room. Looking out the window, he observed a large, luminous, circular object hovering in the sky. The object then accelerated at a fantastic rate of speed and disappeared. This occurred on the same evening and at the same time as the incident reported above.

The conclusions drawn follow:
1) Unidentified flying objects have been sighted in the Cleveland-Akron area with increasing frequency over the last few months.
2) These objects appear to be under intelligent control.
3) The objects are not of this earth - their maneuvers prove this conclusively.
4) The Air Force has been closely investigating these incidents, but the nature and purpose of the strange objects remain a mystery.

To establish the unknown classification, Al Roush spoke to the military authorities whose business it is to know what goes on in the sky. The Military Safety Division of the C.A.A., told TRC that the identity of the object sighted by Mr. Roush was unknown, and that it was not an aircraft known to be operating in this area.

Needless to say, with Mr. Gotha's appearance on the Cleveland Test, the story took on more significance. For the unusual sightings on this evening had a number of independent witnesses.

I understand, however, that the interim report will be made shortly, and the final and complete report will be available at a later date. The unusual nature of this incident warrants immediate and detailed investigation.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
Date of Report: 7 October 1956
From: Cincinnati, Ohio
Subject: Unidentified Flying Object Sightings
On 6 October 1956, at approximately 10:20 p.m., two unidentified flying objects were observed by three individuals in Cincinnati, Ohio. The sightings were reported to the Cincinnati Police Department and to the Air Force.
The three witnesses, Mr. John Doe, Mrs. Jane Doe, and Mr. Richard Roe, were outside their home when they observed two brightly illuminated objects in the sky. The objects were described as circular or elliptical in shape, approximately 50 feet in diameter, and moving in a northeasterly direction at an estimated speed of 600 to 800 miles per hour.
The witnesses stated that the objects emitted a bright, pulsating light and occasionally changed color from white to orange. The objects were observed for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing from view.
Photographic evidence was obtained, and the three photographs are attached to this report.
This incident is being forwarded to Project Blue Book for further investigation and analysis.

No Case Information Only 7 October 1956 Brooklyn, New York

CRIFO investigation of a sighting of a disc-shaped object which was witnessed by several persons at 6:45 PM on 7 October 1956, at Brooklyn, New York. The object was observed for about 15 minutes and was described as being an oval-shaped object with a luminescent glow. It was moving in a southerly direction, at a speed estimated to be approximately 600 knots. The object was directly overhead at one point and was observed to change course and speed on several occasions. It made no sound and there was no trail or exhaust visible. The object disappeared from view in a northerly direction. Witnesses reported a definite feeling of an unusual phenomenon which they could not account for in conventional terms.

Case 231, Springdale, Ohio, Oct. 9, 1956 - By phone Mrs. James Posey reported the following in brief: For approximately 15 minutes she and her husband, James, stood at their kitchen window watching a strange object in the sky. It was difficult to watch them all, she said, as they started up and then came side to side. Strange colors of red and green were observed in the object. When it finally disappeared behind some trees, it was an astounding sight, said Mrs. Posey.

Later, to the surprise of the witness, a countless number of red objects, swarming like bees, came in from the east. Flying in a straight horizontal line, the objects soon disappeared behind some trees. It was an astounding sight, said Mrs. Posey.

AF-UFO REPORT ORDERED DESTROYED
Evidence that the Air Force destroys or has an official UFO reporting system which has been given copy below reproduces the top part of an Air Intelligence Information Report. The Air Force has informed the two AP officers that this report is not routinely handled as a "real" UFO incident - indications of censorship previously unknown to NICAP.

Key points of sighting: 
AF witnesses: Lt. J.S. Belsham, USAF, Squadron Commander, 55th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, Lt. S.E. Standridge, USAF, Squadron Intelligence Officer, Lt. W.D. Elliston, USAF, Squadron Armament Officer.
What was seen: Two objects approaching their aircraft, which was in flight. The first object was observed to be the size of a pea held at arm's length (about one-half the size of the moon), similarly (resembled). Another similar sized object approached from another direction and approached the first one, then disappeared. Flight Commander Pollack was instructed to "very reliably" the Squadron Intelligence Officer, First Lieut. R.W. Malick.
The destruction of similar officially verified reports will reduce the number of UFO records. Regardless of purpose, deletion of such UFO records can only result in misinforming the public.

Captain C. T. Gregory

Dayton, Ohio

Dear Captain Gregory,

Enclosed herewith are three photographs and five negatives obtained by the writer from Reuben H. Holloway, Jr., Director C.R.I.F.O., Cincinnati 27, Ohio, which are of interest as to our examination and study. The detail of these photos is not very clear, but the information regarding them, as obtained from the Director, is as follows:

The object is at present, interested in astronomy particularly lunar studies. According to our easily photograph (which I have marked #5) this object shot up rapidly into the sky, when illuminated, and then disappeared. This photograph was taken by Mr. ___ who lives in the Carthage area. He told the writer that he photographed the "object" while taking a series of shots of the moon. He was greatly interested in the moon, and I feel certain that the photograph in question was not faked in any way. We desire to make studies of this photograph, and any other information that can be developed, in order to determine its authenticity.

The photographs taken by Mr. ___ were taken on Sunday, October 14, 1956, in the Carthage area near Cincinnati. These reports are as follows:

Kind, a very brilliant object, 2 to 3 minutes. Mrs. ___ said the sky was a deep blue, like halfway to a full moon. He said the object was stationary, and nothing of the like had been seen before. It disappeared at the break of dawn, and was unusually brilliant and large. He said it cast no reflection on aircraft as an explanation.

I will appreciate any information or assistance you can give us in studying these photographs and negatives, and if possible, your opinion as to their authenticity. I am enclosing the photographs and negatives and would appreciate your returning them at your convenience when you have completed your examination.

Sincerely yours,
[Director's Signature]

The text in the document is as follows:

Mr. and Mrs. ^ , an employee in the advertising department at Batavia, Ohio. Having first learned of sighting from Mrs. ^ , she was manager. I asked for more detailed information.
Mrs. ^ responded by writing up the following details: "On Sunday, Oct. 14, 1956 at about 6:30 pm, while traveling east on U.S. Highway 52, between Ripley and New Richmond, Ohio, I saw a reddish orange object in the sky. At first I thought it was an airplane, then I realized it was hovering or staying in one position. It seemed to be about 1,000 ft. above the ground and, in a northerly direction for at least a minute then it turned straight up and disappeared out of sight."

OBJECT RED
STARTING HERE LF WAS OFTEN SEEN, AND
THE WHOLE THING SEEMED TO TURN AT ONE TIME.

When the object turned it did not make an arc but made a sharp turn like this ^. 

The whole thing seemed to turn at one time. A jet would have had a curve to its turn but this did not. My wife and I with me at the time. She was driving so I did not take my eyes off it until it was out of sight. They all saw it.

Mr. ^ (and wife) ^ sighted in Northfield Hts, Ky at about 1:30 am. Mr. ^ described the object as large, about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. It was gun metal gray without apparent wings or tail or other appendages. He said the object appeared to be stationary for about a minute, and was quite low.

Thus, in brief, are the descriptions of the UFO's seen by three separate groups on October 14, plus the photographs. I hope they may prove to be of value to you and your command.

P.S.: Please return the enclosed photographs and negatives to the writer after analysis as I left them in my responsibility.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was the Director of the Astronomical Observatory at the University of Chicago, to an unnamed recipient. The letter discusses a series of photographs submitted by the recipient that appear to be related to a UFO sighting. The letter mentions that the recipient should submit the photographs directly for evaluation, rather than to the photo people, as they have discussed the recipient before. The letter also mentions making a copy of a letter from Mr. relating to the circumstances under which the photographs were taken, and states that they will keep this case confidential and comments on it. Finally, the letter discusses the recipient's glass camera and remarks that the writer attempted to attach a "brownie" camera to it when he was younger, which accidentally knocked the telescope completely around on one of the photos. The letter does not appear to contain any human faces.

Dear Dr. Hynek:

Attached herewith is a series of photographs submitted by Mr. ----. This constitutes material news no introduction, inasmuch as we have discussed him before. It may also interest you to learn that this case film, a continuing material under this number, look like a number of a "private" UFO research organization.

I submit these directly to you for evaluation rather than to go our photo people because of photographic aspects which I feel we do not have the degree of sophistication to handle.

Attached also is a copy of a letter from Mr. ---- relating, briefly, the circumstances under which these photos were taken. We shall keep this case confidential and comments on it shall remain so until the "Director* says the results.

As to those quaint glasses, I am prompted to remark that in my younger days as a "teen-scene," I attempted to attach a "brownie" camera to one end of a cardboard tube telescope. I innocently knocked the telescope completely around on one of the photos, after the inevitable action of the contents being thrown about in the painted tunnel of the tube.

It would have been interesting if the zoom was in the same photo with the subjects. As it is, it could be anything photographed. The fact is if the sky was photographed with any degree of magnification, other celestial objects or lights would undoubtedly appear on the plate.

Dear Mr. X,

Attached herewith are the original three (3) photographs and five (5) negatives which you submitted to this organization for review and comment on 7 November 1956. Reference is also made to your request on the status and disposition of this material.

We regret the delay, but as part of the study and reviews, the photographs were submitted to a scientist who later was assigned to an overseas project, leaving them behind.

With reference to your findings, please be advised that the photographs and negatives were subjected to a series of microscopic and other examinations including a feature size projection. The light appears to be emanating from an outside source into a container believed to be the interior of a telescope and projected a cone-like portion of the sky around the moon with the dark portion around the ovoid of light. Further indications that the latter coloration is not a photograph of the sky.

We are not in position to comment whether your source, which you state is an astronomer, was or was not aware of this, or if this is merely a case of an attempted hoax, with you as an unwitting intermediary.

Copies have been made of the original material to be included with our analysis and other data in case files.

Sincerely,
