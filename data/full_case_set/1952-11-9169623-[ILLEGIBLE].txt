The text in the document is as follows:

STORM STATEMENT
10 November 1952

Lt Albert F. Hadford, USAF, 22191367 of the 252nd Air Force Squadron was on a troop training mission between 1300 and 1200 on November 8, 1952 at 1005 on the range at 1113 degrees and 97 miles. The speed was about 6 miles per sweep. The ship was maintaining sight to east across space. It was unresponsive to radio communications. It is believed to be a large trace and reported as such to the crew chief. This time estimate is based on time from 1303 to 1400. The planes landed at the range after the mission at 97 miles. At this speed it was into 10 miles again. This time is only based for a contact of several and then disappeared at about 60 miles. The Tech-rep changed its course during this time. When he did the ship decreased to fairly low altitude where it remained with no further contacts.

I have been a troop operator for four months with the 757th AACN Squadron.

79TH AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SQUADRON
Opheim, Montana
4 December 1952
SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Objects

TO: Chief, Air Technical Intelligence Center
ATTN: AFOIN-4A, Headquarters Air Force Base, Ohio
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

1. In reference to your letter of 13 November 1952, file ATIN-3, subject as above, AF Form 112 is not available at this station. ATIN-3 records to contain same form our support base have met with only partial success, in that only a part of the form is available. Therefore the information requested is set forth in the following paragraphs:

2. The objects were sighted by Mr. Glasgow, Montana, who is an observer with the U.S. Weather Bureau office there. This observation was made on 13 November 1952 at 0243 hours (MST) while he was taking scheduled wind-aloft observations. He first noticed a faint blue-white light in the southwest. This light was the only northwestward movement observed. He then noticed four or five objects trailing each other in a "V" formation. They seemed to be about 30 to 50 feet in diameter, and traveling in a level flight. No noise whatever. He estimated their speed as "that of jet" and the altitude as between two and three thousand feet. The objects appeared to change course or maneuver slightly, and continued in a southwest direction. The two outside objects seemed to bank and move out of formation a little. Estimated distance from observer to objects at the closest point was one mile.

3. There was a thin overcast at the time, and while Mr. Glasgow said it could possibly be light reflecting off the clouds, he would swear that it was something different.

4. Inquiry was made around Glasgow as to the integrity of Mr. Glasgow, and as a result it is believed that he would not be the type to just "dream up" a story of this nature.

1. The sightings were evaluated as "possible balloons".
2. There is a U.S. Weather Bureau Balloon-launching site in Sacramento which could possibly launched a balloon on November 15, 1952 that prior to his sighting.
3. The object(s) descended and came to rest directly over him had at an altitude of five thousand feet remained in sight for about five minutes, give or take a couple of minutes. It was described as a single source of light about the size of a basketball, five or ten miles away. No details could be obtained and no motion was discernible. It remained motionless for about five minutes, it was described as the same size throughout its visibility. It was described as a steady bright light which gave no other indications of propulsion or characteristics of a balloon. It was not reported until the latter part of 1954.

DATE-TIME GROUP: 19 November 1952
LOCATION: Major Allan D. Newton, Asst Wg Ins of Two Civilians of Davis, Calif
SUMMARY: Under the direction of Major Newton, three civilians observed a luminous object for approximately 30 minutes. This object was witnessed by three other local citizens, of whom two were interviewed by the pre-flight officer.

The report indicates that the object transmitted messages on no additional information received signals and did not respond to attempts at communication. The object was described as having a bright red color and moving in various directions, at times appearing to accelerate rapidly. Weather conditions in the sighting area were reported to be good with unlimited visibility.

The report concludes by stating that the observers saw some definite object or phenomenon which has not been otherwise identified.

The document is stamped "UNCLASSIFIED" and signed by Major Allan D. Newton, USA, who appears to be the reporting officer.

P. O. FIELD, MCLEAN, VA.   15 NOVEMBER 1952

ATID-ZD-IS-S
The information in this report was obtained from the files of the United States Air Force Base, Dover, Delaware. The date of the information is November 15, 1952.

Officer of the day at the 1385th Photo Mapping Squadron, Dover Air Force Base, Deleware, Lt. Joseph V. Blair, the navigator at the 1385th Photo Mapping Squadron, observed an unidentified flying object on 15 November 1952 at approximately 1830 hours. Lt. Blair observed the object and proceeded to make certain observations.

In order to verify the existence of this object, Lt. Blair called the control tower to notify them of the observation. They had also observed the object and proceeded to make certain observations. The object appeared to be approximately four hundred (400) feet in altitude with a diameter of approximately fifty (50) feet. 

Immediately following the observation, Lt. Blair called the intelligence officer on duty, Captain Spaeth, to report the sighting. Captain Spaeth proceeded to make certain observations.

The object was observed for about ten (10) minutes at a distance of approximately two (2) miles. The object appeared to be a pulsating light, changing from red to orange to white. There was no air traffic in the vicinity of the sighting at that time.

Output of the text from the document:

One or about 6:45 P.M. on the 9th of November, 1952, a witness observed some thing in the vicinity of MONTVILLE, NEW JERSEY, about 1/2 mile north of the Pequannock River, and just west of Route 23.

The witness stated that the object he observed was approximately the size of a large automobile, and shaped somewhat like a dirigible. The object appeared to be traveling in a straight line at a fairly rapid rate of speed, and was estimated to have been at an altitude of 200 to 300 yards. The witness stated he observed the object for about a minute.

The object was a distinctive color, possibly a silverish-gray. The surface appeared to have a high degree of polish, and seemed to reflect the light from the moon. The object gave off no exhaust or vapor trail, and made no noise.

The witness stated that the object either passed behind or in front of a cloud, disappearing for a brief period of time. The object was next observed continuing on its course, and finally disappeared from sight.

The witness is a highly respected individual, and has a reputation as a reliable observer. Their statement has been highly corroborated by persons in the area, and they stand firmly by their report.

They are a chemist and work for a prominent industry in the vicinity. They have served in both the Army and Navy, and have had a long experience in making aerial observations.

The incident was reported immediately to the State Police, and the Air Force has been informed. They have expressed a desire to have the same thoroughly investigated.

Transcribed text:
"Because of seeming inaction, there is some surprise that no action has been taken on this report of February 15, 1952. I do not feel that this report necessarily requires any investigation, chiefly because the sighting appears to be a natural phenomenon. The right hand side of the object sighted was illuminated, indicating the sunlight was strong enough to cause this effect. With the distance of the object and the illumination, I believe this can be satisfactorily explained as the moon rising with one side illuminated by the sun.

Any comments or further details on this report are not necessary, since it has been thoroughly discussed in the North Prussia Field Office and the analysis I have given appears to be correct. Ild."

About 6:45 pm on the evening of the 15th of November, my friend [REDACTED] called me to the phone and asked me to take a look at an object in the sky to the southeast. I watched the object for about 15 minutes. The object seemed to hover, or stay in about the same place in the sky. It did not appear to have any definite shape. It seemed to reflect the ground lights, and occasionally, when a car headlight would shine in a certain direction, I could see the object quite clearly, but most of the time it seemed to blend in with the surroundings. It was giving off a reddish-white glow. I would estimate its altitude to be about 3000 feet. There was no sound or any indication of motion, other than an occasional seeming to change position slightly. Its behavior seemed quite erratic. I did not take it to be an airplane or any conventional aircraft. I hope this information will be of interest to you.

There is no photograph or image present in this page of the Project Blue Book document. The page contains typed text describing an incident where an unidentified aerial object was observed near Landrum, South Carolina on November 16, 1952. The text includes details about the object's appearance, movement, and the investigation of the incident.

CASE #2:
Major [REDACTED], activated, sent a letter on 26 Jan 53 to ATIC describing an incident. A film was submitted by Capt. [REDACTED] with an agreement that the Air Force would analyze the film, make 2 copies, and give its opinion, within security limits, to [REDACTED] owner of the film. The film submitted was approximately 50" of 8 mm color film of unidentified aerial objects taken near Landrum, South Carolina, on 16 November 1952. Mr. [REDACTED], Air Force Press Desk, has promised that no publicity will be given to the owner of the film without his consent and that no copies will be shown to anyone but representatives of ATIC (except, of course, Air Force personnel).
The following dispatch was incorporated into the data submitted by Major [REDACTED] within his letters. This data concerns the object which McLenna photographed. Dispatch is dated 16 November 1953, Florence, South Carolina. Dispatch states that "several hundred converters" including an official of CAA observed this object which was reported in the sky over Florence. It slowly circled to the SW and then disappeared. [REDACTED], aircraft communicator for the CAA, watched the object for 6 minutes and described it as first appearing in the W at about 10,000' and slowly moving to the SW before disappearing. He said the object was glowing extremely brightly and likened its shape to a saucer tilted at an angle of about 20' with this edge down and bearing no sound or smoke. [REDACTED] was a n aircraft communicator for the CAA for 11 years and a licensed pilot at the time of sighting. Ellis added that a check with Shaw AFB showed no jet aircraft aloft in the vicinity. He also added that the CAA station at Lumberton had reported sighting an object. No such incident in files of ATIC.

1. Owner of film: [REDACTED], Pascagoula, Miss.
2. The pictures were taken by [REDACTED], a resident of Treyon, N.C. They were taken at sunset on Nov 16, 1952, by the roadside of the Abernathy Farm, near Landrum, S.C. Time: 5:15 p.m.
3. The first part of the strip was with a one and one-half inch telescope lens at f 3.5 setting on a Bell and Howell 8 mm camera. The second part of the film was taken with the camera's regular lens at f 2.5. There were many more objects visible than can be seen on the film.
4. Sky was clear at the point where the pictures were taken, but broken clouds on western horizon were sufficient to give color to the sunset.
5. Eleven objects were sighted. Data on variation in altitude, sound, color, is given in supplements below.
6. This film is submitted by TRUE Magazine, via [REDACTED], in accordance with an agreement that the Air Force will analyze the film, make two copies, and give its opinion, within security limits, to Mr. [REDACTED], as the owner. No copies of this film without Mr. [REDACTED]'s permission, and that no copies will be shown to anyone but representatives of TRUE (except of course Air Force personnel).

Dear Sir,

On April 24, 1953, I received from the Department of Defense a letter concerning certain film which showed several unidentified flying objects. For your convenience, I am enclosing a copy of your letter of April 24, 1953.

In your letter you indicate that a "cursory examination" of the film revealed the objects of interest; however, the film will later be given a thorough analysis and you will be advised of the results to call your attention to the results of your examination of my film, as you promised. I feel that since I gave consideration to your interest that the least that you can do is to fulfill the promise contained in your original letter of April 24, 1953.

Since you have had my film for approximately one year, I feel that you have had ample time in which to examine and evaluate it; therefore, if your use of my film is completed, I shall appreciate your returning it to me at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

Gentlemen:

I am enclosing herewith, a copy of my letter, dated January 11, 1954 to Robert C. White, 1st Lt., Air Force Press Desk, Washington, D.C. and a copy of his reply. Both of which are self-explanatory.

I feel that you should be acquainted with this matter as fully as might be expected, accordingly. I feel that you should find it a little manner within this to make my letter to 1st. White, a part of the record, so that you have had my file for a period of time long enough for you to make any observations or comments of it and that surely as instructive and illuminating as I could make it.

Since this has to do with the fact that you have several copies or photographs at your disposal and as such in the future. Therefore, I am requesting the immediate return of my film(original), together with the analysis thereof made by you.

I shall appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
[Redacted], Mississippi

1. Attached is a roll of film that was requested by your office that could be retained for possible analysis. The following analysis may be used if you desire in your answer letter.

2. The Air Force does not attach significance to these pictures because:
a. Only a few frames contain anything that is discernible.
b. No movement of any object could be seen.
c. On the frames that something could be seen there were two blobs of bright lights, apparently reflected from the sun. In that the glass were taken on a sunny day, the sun, its reflection could not always be avoided. Sometimes called "mock sun" or "sun dog".

USMC, Res. Air Force to accompany 8 mm film of unidentified aerial objects, taken near Landrum, S.C., Nov. 16, 1952.

Dear Bob:
As I promised to write you about the flying saucers we saw a couple of weeks ago, I am finally getting around to it. As you know, we were returning to the Eastover, S.C. area when this happened. It was about 6:15 p.m. when I happened to look out and saw what appeared at first to be a plane. However, the more I watched it, the more I became convinced that it was not a plane, but some kind of flying saucer. (I took some pictures.) I immediately called the Lincoln Army Airbase and told them what I had seen. They said they would send a crew out to investigate.

When I first observed them they were strung across the western horizon in this fashion:

[Description of the sighting follows, without any mention of human faces in the images.]

They did, however, show definite north to south movement. At times they hovered in one spot, then suddenly darted off, only to return to the same general area. The movement was quite erratic and so fast at times as to be almost unbelievable. Some times the objects would suddenly speed up and some times they would absolutely stop and hang motionless for a few seconds.
[The text continues with a detailed description of the sighting, without mentioning any human faces.]

Dear [REDACTED],

Just finished your letter and am glad something might come of the "saucers". The following is about what happened. We sighted the objects on the 16th of Nov, 1952, at 6:15 in the afternoon. I am positive as the time, as I phoned my office right at the time saying I had just sighted some objects to the west on the horizon where we sighted the objects. there were few when I first saw the saucers they were eleven (11) in number and were streaking across the sky like a string of pearls, and appeared as large as an automobile hub cap. As I stated previously, one was breaking formation and appeared to go through another while another would do the same. The speeding and descending saucer made an abrupt right angle turn in leveling therefrom. We saw no more than four. I am convinced had not daylight caught up with me, I would have followed one off to the horizon.

I would judge at the time there were tens the number. I am unable to estimate their size, other than they appeared smaller than any aircraft I have had the opportunity to observe. The impressive they were traveling in an east to west direction and maintaining a perfect formation until they disappeared from view. There were no sounds accompanying the saucers and no less thaen four-I am convinced would have captured one, could I have gotten in touch with them at the time. I would hope, that is the time they were able to observe as I am convinced they were traveling in an east to west direction that seemed to scoot across the horizon. When we finally lost them to view they were about the size of the hub caps on my Ford and when we finally lost them they maneuvering just as would an aircraft visible at the time and I remember looking at the charlotte Observer's September 7, 1953 where it showed the sighting on that date.

Trust the above is about what you want. Will get this off.

All my love to [REDACTED].

Florence, 9-6-Air Area:
A flying saucer spotted in Florence, 9-6 - area. According to an air force communication for the CAA tower, the object was on the west at about 10,000 feet and the witnesses said it was completely silent - just like a television set turned off. The CAA official described the object as glowing extremely brightly without any visible means of propulsion. He said he watched it hover and saw no smoke or flame. The object was observed for about 10 minutes and then disappeared from sight quickly. Witnesses at the CAA station at Lamb-Teton had reported sighting the object earlier. Marion police officers on travel were at the CAA office to say that they had observed the object in the sky toward Florence.

This page from the Project Blue Book document does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a typed letter describing the author's personal experience observing unidentified aerial objects. The text in the document is as follows:

Dear [REDACTED] (apparently nickname [REDACTED]),

I promised to write you about the flying saucers we say a couple of Sundays ago, so here goes. We were returning from our vacation and were several miles of approaching Tryon, when I happened to look up and saw them. I counted five objects that appeared to be about the size of a basketball and they seemed to be traveling in a formation of five. They suddenly jumped out of my sight in my excitment, and when I regained my composure I looked closely at the pictures (I immediately pulled his Lincoln up on the shoulder of the road and we all got out with the exception of his aunt, a Miss old lady from Mt. Airy who could not get out. be bothered.

When I first observed them they were strung across the western horizon in this fashion:

When I glimpsed them first they were about the size of a conventional automobile tire and were the color of aluminum. I could not observe any forward speed at any time, but I did get the impression that they were traveling in a westerly direction, that is, away from us, and I think this on the fact that they diminished in size, from that of an auto tire to about the size of a tennis ball.

They did, however, show a definite north to south movement at times. At other times one would go straight up like an elevator while another would show a diagonal movement. In speed and visibility, some times several would disappear and at times we could see varying numbers of them at other times we never saw more than eleven and less than three. The color when first seen by me was furnished silver which gradually changed to a burning orange. There was no noise, due no doubt to the great distance, nor were there any vapor trails to be seen.

I tried to view them objectively and attempted to keep a proper sequence in my mind. I expected, while looking at them, they would appear to his wife or for their impressions which in that event would agree with what I was seeing. As you know, our camera bugs. were the time being about 15 to 20 miles distant, so he did not have time to get any pictures of them.

As most know, I have been most skeptical of these things. But I can say now will all sincerity, I am convinced and no amount of rationalizing can shake me this belief. I am convinced I have been something the likes of which I have never seen before.

To corroborate what we saw, I had only to pick up the Charlotte Observer the following morning and there it was.

Dear [REDACTED],

Just finished your letter and I am glad something might come of the "saucer" pictures. In regard to the data you request about the "saucers": The following is about what happened. We sighted the objects in the sky on the 18th of Nov. 1952, at 5:15 in the afternoon. I am positive as the time of day as I glanced at my watch at the time, so there is no arguing this point.

The weather was clear where we were standing but off to the west on the horizon where we sighted the objects there were a few broken clouds, enough to give us some color in the sunset. When I first saw the saucers they were cloven (11) in number and were strung out like a string of beads, and appeared to be traveling in the same direction, that is, they gave the formation and ascent and descend downward while maintaining opposite directions at times.

The ascending and descending saucer made an abrupt right angle turn in leaving the formation. We at no time saw more than eleven objects and no less than four. I am convinced had not we telescopic lens we would have captured the whole sequence of events.  

I would judge the time element, that is, the time we were able to view the, was in the neighborhood of twelve minutes. I observed no variation in altitude the entire time but I did get the impression they were traveling in an east to west direction and I base that on the fact that when first seen they would about size of the hub caps on my Ford and when we finally lost them to view they were about the size of tennis balls. There were no aircraft visible at the time and I

Big Saucer over Marion
H.S. Epps, chief of police at Nichols, near here, said tonight he had received more than a score of telephone calls from people seeking information about an unidentified object sighted in the sky west of Nichols this afternoon. The object was sighted between 4:30 and 5 p.m. Chief Epps said information indicated the object was silver in color, about twice the size of a house, was whirling and rising at an angle.

Flying Saucer Spotted in Florence, S.C. Area
Florence, S.C. Nov. 15. AP: It's flying saucer time again and followers of that craze apparently have a couple of hundred converts here-today, including an official of the CAA station. Shortly after 5 o'clock this afternoon, a shiny object was reported in the skies west of Florence. It slowly circled to the southwest and then disappeared. Telephones at the Florence Morning News were flooded with calls. So were those at the U.S. Weather Bureau station and the CAA office at Municipal airport.

A licensed pilot, said the object was "unlike anything I have ever seen." He added that when he first saw the object it was in the west at about 10,000 feet and that it slowly moved to the southwest before disappearing. He said he believed a smaller thought that it was a jet aircraft or even a magnesium flare such as the type used by aircraft in target practice. "It lasted too long and moved too slowly," he said.

The CAA official described the object as glowing extremely brightly and likened its shape to a saucer fitted at an angle of about 30 degrees with a thin edge down and heavier lip up. He said it saw no smoke.

Page 2. Data for Air Force to accompany 8 mm film of unidentified aerial objects, taken near Landrum, S.C., Nov. 16, 1952.

Dear --- (apparently nickname for ---) 

I promised to write you about the flying saucers we saw a couple of Sundays ago. We saw two discs going down around Spartanburg area and were traveling in a northerly direction, that is toward Tryon, when I happened to look out of the car window in a westerly direction and then I saw them. I almost jumped out of my skin in my excitement, and N--- (who took the pictures) immediately pulled his Lincoln up on the shoulder of the road and we all got out with the exception of his aunt, a blase old lady from N.Y. who just couldn't be bothered.

When I first observed them they were strung across the western horizon in this fashion:

When I glimpsed them first they were about the size of a conventional automobile tire and were the color of aluminum. I could not observe any forward speed at any time, but I did get the impression that they were traveling in a westerly direction, that is, away from us, and I have this on the fact that they diminished in size, from that of an auto tire to about the size of a tennis ball.

They did, however, show a definite south movement at times. At other times one would go straight up like an elevator while another would show a side to side movement. This and down movement was quite marked both in speed and visibility. Some times several would disappear and at times we could see varying numbers of them although we never saw more than eleven and never less than three. The color when first seen by me was a burnished silver which gradually changed to a burning orange. There was no noise, due no doubt to the great distance, nor were there any vapor trails to be seen.

I tried to view them objectively and attempted to keep a proper sequence in my mind. I repeatedly, while looking at them, would ask S---(apparently Mrs. S) for their impressions which in each event would agree with what I was seeing. As you know, she and I are camera bugs and attempted to take movies of them. As the light was fast fading, the time being about 5:15, I do hope they come out good and if he has any luck will send them on to you. You can get some camera store to run them off for you.

As you know, I have been most skeptical of these things. But I can say now with all sincerity, I am convinced and no amount of rationalizing can make me think otherwise, as I am convinced I have seen something the likes of which I have never seen before.

To corroborate what we saw, I had only to pick up the Charlotte Observer...

Monday's addition to send in article about the same things being observed over Anderson and Marion, S.C. at the same time were 'were seeing them over our vicinity.' In as much as the article stated the surrounds were swamped at the places mentioned, also the air base at Greenville,S.C. I made no comment to tell 'em. I did attempt to tell about these objects, the layers of hot and cold air, but he went into a dissertation on clouds. I wouldn't argue with him and let it go at that.

Second letter:
Tryon, N.C., 1-8-53.

Dear --,
Just finished your letter and am glad something might come of the 'saucers' pictures. I'm enclosing to the data you request about the 'saucers.'
The following is about what happened. We sighted the objects in the sky on the 16th Nov., 1952, at 5:15 in the afternoon. I am positive as the time of day as I glanced at my watch at the time, so there is no arguing this point.
The weather was clear where we were standing off to the west on the horizon we sighted the objects there, where a few broken clouds, enough to give us some color in the sunset. When I first saw the saucers they were eleven (11) in number and seemed like a string of beads, and appeared as large as an automobile hub cap. As I stated previously, one would leave its formation and ascend straight up while another would do the exact opposite and descend downward.
The ascending saucers made an abrupt right angle turn in leaving the formation. We at no time saw more than eleven objects and no less than eight. The formation had not dissolved until the telescopic lens we would have captured the whole sequence of events.
I would judge the time element, that is, the time we were able to view the, was in the neighborhood of twelve minutes... I observed no variation in altitude the entire time but I did get the impression they were traveling in an east to west direction and I base that on the fact that when first seen they would about the size of the jub caps on my Ford and when we finally lost them to view they were about the size of tennis balls. There were no aircraft visible at the time and I observed it carefully."

Page 4. Data for Air Project to accompany 8 mm film of unidentified aerial objects taken near Land_mm, S. C. Nov. 16, 1952.

I remember reading the Charlotte Observer the next day, Nov. 17, 1952, at which time the same objects were sighted over Anderson, S.C. and Marion. The article went on to say they were sighted over the two places at exactly the same time we saw them, Sunday, Nov. 16, 1952, at 5:15 p.m. and that the switchboards were swamped with inquiries and that upon checking the various service bases no planes were in the air at that time.

Trust the above is about what you want. Will get this off the mail special delivery.

Copy of two items in the Charlotte Observer, Nov. 17, 1952:

Page 1, lower right corner:
Big Saucer over Marion
Marion, S.C. Nov. 16. Chief of police at Nichols, near here, said tonight he had received more than a score of telephone calls from people seeking information about an unidentified object sighted in the sky west of Nichols this afternoon. The chief said information indicated the object was silver in color, about twice the size of a house, was whirling and sailing at an angle.

Flying Saucer Spotted in Florence, S.C. Area
Florence, S.C. Nov. 16. AP. It's flying saucer time again and followers of that craze apparently have a couple of hundred converts yesterday, including an official of the CAA station. Shortly after 5 o'clock this afternoon, a shiny object was reported in the skies west of Florence. It slowly circled to the southwest and then disappeared. Telephones at the Florence Morning News were flooded with calls. So were those at the U.S. Weather Bureau station and the CAA offices at the Municipal airport.

The aircraft communicator for the CAA for 11 years, and a licensed pilot, said the object was "just like anything I have ever seen." He said that when he first saw the object it was in the west at about 10,000 feet and that it slowly reversed to the southwest before disappearing. He added that he watched it for six minutes which dispelled an earlier thought that it was a jet aircraft or even a magnesium flare such as the type used by aircraft in target practice. "It lasted too long and moved too slowly," he said.

The CAA official described the object as glowing extremely brightly and likened its shape to a saucer tilted at an angle of about 30 degrees with a thin edge down and heavier lip up. He said he heard no sound and saw no smoke.

It was added that a check with Shaw Air Force Base at Sumter showed no
jet aircraft aloft in the vicinity. He also said that the CAA station at Lumberton
had reported sighting the object. It tried to follow it toward Florence, but it
tried to follow it toward Florence, but was lost sight of it over the Pee Dee River.
A Sumter newspaperman traveling toward Florence, stopped at the CAA office
to say that he had seen the object in the sky toward Dillon and Mullins.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
IR-63-52
DIS/Inc, NEAC

1. The following information concerning the sighting of an unidentified object was furnished by the Commanding Officer of McAndrew AFB on the sighting of an unidentified object.

2. At approximately 2150Z, [REDACTED], sighted the object and reported it to the Control Tower. The object was sighted by the station personnel of McAndrew AFB, 47.48N/95.59W. The witness described the object as circular, about 6-8 feet in diameter, and 2-3 feet thick, with a white light on its upper surface. The color of the object was a dull gray.

3. Testimony of 1/Lt [REDACTED]:
"The ooject was sighted off to the right of flight of the object and came from the southwest and made a dip and turn toward the northwest and then departed to the northwest at a high rate of speed. It was estimated the size of the object to be that of a grapefruit. When it made its dip, the light seemed to dim and it momentarily disappeared from view. It then reappeared and resumed its original course and speed. I was unable to estimate attitude, but it appeared to be traveling at a constant altitude. I had to discontinue observation due to the object disappearing from view."

4. Testimony of [REDACTED], (object was sighted on the way to meet an incoming flight):
"I noticed a large brilliant object, approximately the size of a basketball, hovering approximately 500 feet from the southbound runway. It remained stationary for about two minutes and then took off in a southeasterly direction at a very high rate of speed. It appeared to be a solid white object, and the edges seemed to glimmer as if it was revolving or spinning. When it took off, it seemed to glow brighter for an instant, and then in a matter of seconds it turned to the southwest and disappeared in the direction with an undulating motion. The object was sighted at 2135Z."

5. Interview of A/2C [REDACTED], who was at the Flight Line, Argentina Naval Air Station:
"I sighted an object over Placentia Bay, 47.48N/53.59W, while performing ground control. The object hovered about 5 minutes, made one abrupt turn, and then departed to the southwest at a very high rate of speed. The object halted in what appear to be the area of Placenta Peak for about 20 minutes. The object then departed in a southwesterly direction at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view."

6. Testimony of S/Sgt [REDACTED], AFS to Argentina:
"I observed a shooting star in flight between Copper Lake and Sydney, Nova Scotia, approximately 2200Z. It appeared to make an arc."

The report describes an observation made on 15 November 1952 by Capt. Bernard and Lt. Bernard, who were flying at 13,450 feet over Germany. They observed an unidentified object that was initially about 1 mile away, but gradually increased in size, indicating it was approaching the aircraft. The object was described as circular in shape, with a halo of hazy light around it. It was estimated to be 30-40 feet in diameter. The object appeared to be turning in a left-hand orbit around a central point, and the radius of the orbit continued increasing. The report provides details about the speed, size, and movements of the observed object.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. 52-250
DATE 9/11/52 8:4C
The altitude and full description of the object and it's actions were described by the pilot, by radio to "Mosquito Control" a ground control, during the sighting.
The object circling three times to the left in a diameter ranging from 100 to 10,000 feet, according to the pilot's estimate, and their turned off at what both ground observers estimated as approximately 15,000 feet altitude. It was described as a bright white object, approximately 15 feet in diameter, 2 feet thick, and traveling at an estimated speed of 700 to 800 miles per hour. It performed acrobatics and made sharp turns with the naked eye. Lt Bernard were government issue greenish brown.
No special devices were used. The entire sighting extended over a period of 15 minutes, during which the object exhibited various colors - yellows, reds, greens, blues, and whites. Against the dark terrain and blue sky and white clouds. It remained constant in size and shape.
Both observers state that the general motion of the object was steady and gave no indication of falling or vertical oscillation. They stated that it did not appear to be moving on the motion of air currents.
The pilot had flown 54 missions in this theater and the observer had flown 18. Statements were obtained and are attached to this report, along with the Intelligence Officer, Control Group, statement regarding the technical details of the object which indicate the apparent size and flight paths of the object as reported by Lt Bernard.
COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICER:
1. Details regarding the sighting of this object are considered authentic and fighting reports in an earlier report covering this incident have been compared and found to be essentially accurate except for one or two minor points which are normal for observations of this type. Lt Bernard, the pilot, and his observer appear to be reliable and the report appears credible.
2. During the inquiry conducted by the investigating officer, it was established that during his encounter with this object control with Mosquito Control Group: they reported that no other object besides their aircraft was picked up by the radar.
3. Lt Col Andrew Payton, Operations Officer, 30th Weather Squadron was contacted. He stated that the only weather condition prevailing in that area at that time was a 30 gram "ceiling" with a minimum 500 feet. They were approximately 6,000 feet.
At Telcherne, Georgia, approximately south west of the area in which the object was sighted, the ground was covered with a light ground fog, very similar to that so often described with these unidentified aerial objects.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: (AGENCY)
DET 1, 6604th AISS, APO 970

DATE 2-3-50

SUBJECT: S2-350

The balloon released was a natural latex (white) color. The rate of ascent on this initial flight was approximately 600 fpm. The burst was observed at approximately 60,000 ft. The balloon carried a small radio transmitter, which emitted an intermittent signal until the balloon burst. The balloon descended slowly, and it was estimated that one part of the balloon was still attached to the payload or instrument after the burst. It will be possible that the unidentified object could have been this 350 balloon.

D/F SNAP Comments:
Not being able to identify the object conclusively would naturally lead to the assumption that the unidentified sighting was the 350 balloon. However, the description of the sighting does not agree with the characteristics of the 350 balloon, which was a normal latex type and ascended and burst at the usual altitudes. There have been a number of reports of unidentified sightings in this area at about the time of this incident, so the object observed was probably something other than the 350 balloon. It is reported that at least 5 sightings have tentatively been identified, and if these reports are correct, the object seen was not the 350 balloon.

It is therefore apparent that the object observed was not the 350 balloon, and was probably a balloon, and possibly a natural or artificial satellite. The object was probably a balloon, and possibly a natural or artificial satellite.

The image contains a photograph of an unidentified object or craft in the sky. The document appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, and it includes meteorological data and information about radar interference observed on November 8, 1952.

PART I. 5. Yes. Interference from other radar sets has been observed. For that reason the transmitting frequency was changed during the observation. After changing the frequency to 20 me lower, the target in question became indistinct. Interference with the effects and appearance of "noise" was present.

PART II. 2. The weather data given below was furnished by a USAF Weather Unit attached to the 543rd Air Division (Defense), Keesler AFB, N Mexico.

Time/date of sounding
02002 5 November 1952

The observer stated that the object appeared to be metallic in color and estimated the size of the object to be 30-40 feet in diameter. The observer was in an open field at the time of the sighting and observed the object for approximately 10-15 seconds. There is no further information on the type of propulsion, speed, or trajectory of the object after it accelerated straight up and out of sight.

The object passed overhead at an altitude estimated to be approximately 1000 yards or less. The color of the object was white or slightly luminous, and the shape was something like an ellipse. It appeared to be approximately 40-50 feet in length and 12-15 feet in width. The object appeared to be in a horizontal position as it passed over, and it traveled at a high rate of speed, estimated to be between 600 and 700 miles per hour. The object made no sound and left no trail. The duration of the observation was approximately 3-4 seconds. The sky was clear, with only scattered clouds present. The object was observed first by one witness and then by several other witnesses in the immediate area. The object passed overhead and disappeared in the distance toward the northwest. The witnesses were impressed by the speed and size of the object, and they stated that it was not like any aircraft they had ever seen before.

[THE TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT IS AS FOLLOWS:]

Summary of Unidentified Aerial Object
1. The object was first observed by the Pilot and Co-Pilot at an altitude estimated at around 10,000 feet. They had been cruising at 330 knots at 10,000 feet. After observing the object, they began a gradual descent and the object followed them in a parallel course. They observed the object for a period of approximately 15 to 20 minutes.
2. The object was described as being circular in shape, silver in color, and approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. It appeared to be flying faster than the aircraft which was then cruising at 330 knots. It appeared to have no visible means of propulsion and made no sound.
3. The object was observed to make a very tight turn, estimated at a radius of 500-700 feet, at a speed which would be impossible for any known aircraft. This maneuver was repeated several times during the sighting. The pilots stated that the object appeared to be under intelligent control.
4. During the entire period of observation, the object maintained a parallel course with the aircraft, never deviating more than 2-3 miles from the aircraft. At one point, the object crossed directly in front of the aircraft at a distance estimated to be only 1/2 mile.
5. The appearance and disappearance of the object was abrupt, with no discernible means of propulsion. It simply appeared and disappeared, accelerating and decelerating at a rate of speed that would be impossible for any known aircraft.
6. This sighting is considered to be authentic and the pilots are completely reliable. They are highly experienced and this was their first experience with such a phenomenon. They were greatly impressed by what they saw and felt that it was definitely an unidentified flying object under intelligent control.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Report No.: 52-350
Page: 2 of 4 Pages

On 15 November 1952, at 1942, Lt. Barnard, pilot, USAF, and Lt. Richard F. Barnum, navigator, USAF, both of the 55th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, were intercepting an unidentified flying object.

At 13,575 feet, they first sighted the object, which appeared to be a point source of light. As they approached, the object veered away at a high rate of speed, climbing to an estimated 20,000 feet in the vicinity. The pilot and navigator, observers, were flying a combat mission in the aircraft over the central sector of the friendly area.

The object initially was sighted approximately 20-25 miles in a northerly direction. The weather conditions were clear, with visibility unlimited. The object appeared to be motionless, at approximately the same altitude and in a northerly direction. The weather conditions at the time were clear, with a light westerly wind at 10,000 feet generally from 250 degrees wind direction.

Lt Bass first noted the unidentified object moving north, apparently close to the aircraft. The object (possibly a balloon or possibly sky coverage) was originally observed against the slope of Orang-San (Papan-an) at CT6545.55. The object initially appeared to be an estimated 5-10 miles and then turned south and gained altitude. At the same time the object appeared to be leaving a trail or vapor.

Lt Bass again sighted the object and identified it as not being an aircraft, as it did not show any lights or running lights. This sighting was at an estimated 10-15 miles at which time the object appeared to be spherical in shape, silver in color and approximately 10-15 feet in diameter. There was no evidence of any protrusions or any sort. The surface was smooth.

When Lt Bass saw the object, which was moving at approximately the same speed as the aircraft which he estimated to be 300-400 knots, the object headed south and began climbing at a high rate of speed, turning into a left-handed turn around the aircraft. He advised the pilot as to the direction of the object.

Lt Barnard's description of the object was that it was a "silver spherical object, the size of a man's fist held at extended arm's length." He further described the object as "shimmering" and having a "halo" which surrounded the object. The halo was about 2 to 3 times the diameter of the object itself. He further stated that the shimmering effect appeared to be more apparent when the object was turning.

That the object was burning in a left-hand orbit about a central point, with the shimmering or flickering distinctly evident. The pilot, Lt Barnard, stated that the object's shape remained constant and appeared to increase in speed as it moved. After the first complete circle, the object appeared to climb more rapidly, and continued increasing the radius of its circle.

The altitude and full description of the object and it's actions were described by the pilot, by radio to "Mosquito Control" a ground control, during the sighting.

The object circling there [sic] to the left in a disaster ring from 100 to 500 feet above the pilot's aircraft. This caused it, the object, to completely disappear from the pilot's view while the object was circling on the far side of the sun. It is estimated the object was at approximately 16,000 feet when it disappeared from observation with the naked eye. It Bernard were [sic] government issue greenish brown.

We optical device was used. The entire sighting extended over a period of 3 minutes. The object was observed against various colored backgrounds, the dark terrain, and the blue sky and white clouds. It remained constant in shape.

Both sources state that the general motion of the object was steady and gave the impression of controlled flight. They stated that it did not appear to be moving on the motion of air current.

The pilot had flown 54 missions in this theater and the observer had flown 48 missions.

Statements were obtained and attached to this report, along with the letters from the Intelligence Officer/Military Technical Control Group. The statements indicate the approximate flight paths of the object, and the rapidly changing speed, which indicates the object was under precise control. The points as covered in the several debriefings they received.

COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICERS:
1. It is believed the sightings considered to be competent observers and sightings reported by them are considered reliable. Both officers gave exact information. However, save considerable detail in his debriefing which is reflected in this report.
2. During the inquiry conducted by the investigating officer, it was indicated that no other object beside their aircraft was picked up by the radar.
3. Lt Col Andrew Payton, Operations Officer, 30th Weather Squadron was interviewed. He remained that the air force installation in that area at Chip'o-ri (CS322), however the largest weather balloon utilized by this unit 1250 cubic feet. He stated that there was little further known pertaining to any this object or object since that incident or any other balloon operations in that area reported during the period.
4. At Yokchoang, Korea: CS3099 approximately south west of the area in flight, the pilot, 1st Lt Smith sighted the object near his aircraft. Lieutenant Smith, the officer in charge of operation at that site, reported on 5 November 1952 that he saw the object for approximately 250 yards under his command and control, and during the period he observed it he attempted to close in on it and that it promptly outdistanced his aircraft.

The balloon released was a natural latex (white) color. The rate of ascent on this balloon was approximately 600 feet per minute, according to the acquarters. This air is credible in that it is apparently based upon actual observation.
2. It is possible that the unidentified object could have been this 350 gram balloon.
JOHN H. GUFFING
Major, USAF
Commanding

1. The 350 gram balloon released 20 minutes previous to the sighting would have to be considered as a possible explanation unless it were leakage (which would preclude the rapid climb described).
2. There does appear to be an absence of evidence of any actual sighting in the case. Descriptions indicate that the object was probably a balloon, and analysis has been inconclusive. Views expressed are purely individual.
Verification of a disappear/re-appear of a free balloon is actually difficult, and falls into the category of almost impossible to substantiate. On the one hand, the object was probably a balloon, and possibly one launched by scientific endeavor.

Subject: Statement of identified flying object.

About 0400 Hrs, I spotted the object from our position and was extremely convinced that what I saw was not any conventional aircraft or anything that I was familiar with. I have the impression that the object was a saucer shaped and had some form of illumination on its surface. 

At this point it might be pertinent to note a possible explanation for the object's strange behavior. The object was maneuvering at high speeds which appeared to suddenly gain altitude and distance by pointing out that the object sometimes disappeared from our right wing, but this must undoubtedly have been due to the direction my senses must have been confused. In any case, to our right side, I had to turn my head sometimes, for I could not keep the object constantly under observation.

When I first spotted the object it was in a position which I described to lieutenant was at 10 o'clock level (in order to confirm my bearing, I asked the navigator if he could see the object which he confirmed by pointing to the approximate location.) 

However, the object continued to maintain its position in a southerly direction, with no sound or trail, and changing its speed and altitude, sometimes appearing to be hovering while at other times accelerating rapidly. The object was highly maneuverable, making extremely sharp turns and movements.

Quite honestly, I am the one who had reported the sighting to headquarters as I considered it deserving of special interest. As a professional I am confident in my estimate that its altitude was approximately 12,000 to 15,000 feet, and finally 13,000 feet. It was spotted for about 10-12 minutes before it disappeared, fading away in the distance.

STATEMENT
15 November 1952

On 15 November 1952, I was pilot in a T-33 fighter jet of the 33rd FIS at Castle AFB, California, when at approximately 6:52 PM, I sighted an unidentified object at a distance of approximately 5 to 7 miles at my altitude of 30,000 feet. The object flew in a Southwesterly direction, directly into the sun and estimated to be at approximately 18,000 feet. The object was observed by the naked eye. I was not wearing sun glasses. Object was observed for approximately 5 to 7 minutes.

STATEMENT

19 November 1952

As 1345r hours, 15 November 1952, I was flying as an observer with Ash Cabe Captain 3, an individual of 10,500 feet, over the western portion of Michigan, near the town of Muskegon, at an angle of 15 degrees above the horizon. We were in a steady, level, straight-line course, headed approximately 270 degrees magnetic. The time was just about 1 hour and 20 minutes before sunset. 

Suddenly, I observed a bright, metallic, disc-like object, with a pointed tip, approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, hovering nearly motionless between us and the horizon, my estimate being between 2,500 and 3,000 yards distant. The object was at approximately 10,000 feet altitude, and was located on a bearing approximately 20 degrees left of the nose of our aircraft. It appeared to be rotating slowly on some axis, as it was reflecting the sun's rays which caused it to appear very bright. I called the pilot's attention to the object, and he also observed it. We maintained visual contact with the object for approximately 1 minute, until it suddenly accelerated at a phenomenal rate and disappeared from view, leaving no trail.

Shortly after this moment, certainly less than a minute, Lieutenant Bash dropped my attention to the disc-like object he had observed, but they were in the meteorological pattern of a bri ef front, several miles distant, and there was no connection or association between that and what I had observed. I immediately informed Ash Cake Control and was informed that as yet they had no sightings or reports of this nature in the area.

The object itself was not circular, but more in the shape of a pointed oval or lens. It was an obvious sighting and excited my attention immediately because of its bright, metallic, disc-like appearance. This halo was not the result of ground reflection, being a more brilliant appearance, and could not be attributed to any atmospheric conditions or any point light source. It was the hard, sharp outline of the object itself that was so strikingly visible against the pale blue sky background.

The speed with which the object accelerated and disappeared from sight was more fantastic than any operational jet aircraft I have observed. In any way or at any point, when we were looking directly at it, it did not appear to be anything other than a solid, metallic, disc-like object - there was, at no time, any indication of exhaust or any trail associated with its motion. The general direction of its departure was in the area between us and the general direction of the sun, but it was not shadowed or obscured in any way - it was when we were looking at it with the sun at our backs that it was most clearly visible.

I would personally insist that it was, as I have said, off our left front, and was at the closest range that I am accustomed to estimating distances - between 500 and 1,000 yards distant, probably closer to the latter figure.

Subject: Statement of Unidentified Flying Objectives

Until the object left the vicinity, an approximately uniform position was maintained in relation to the varying speed of our aircraft. At one point the object appeared to be stationary, then it moved away at great speed. As we passed the object, its relative position seemed to change to a point where the object was looking backward at us. It appeared to be approximately circular in shape and gave the impression of uniformly lighted surface except for a dark area near the center side. According to the description, the motion of the object was erratic, with frequent changes in direction and speed. The text suggests that the object's behavior was not consistent with a simple theory of propulsion, and that its motion may have involved acceleration that exceeds the reasonable limits of man-made technology. The document appears to be an official report describing an encounter with an unidentified aerial phenomenon.

Until the object left the vicinity, an approximately uniform position was maintained in relation to the varying speed of our aircraft.  At one point the object appeared to be stationary, then it moved away at great speed.  As we passed the object, its relative position seemed to change to a point where the objeot was looking backward at us.  It appeared to be approximately circular in shape and gave the impression of uniformly lighted surface except for a dark area near the center side.  We brought it back approximately inline with our left wing.  I had detached it all the time with our left wing.  This impression, was confirmed, and this impression was confirmed.
We were apparently at a slightly higher orbibaltitude than the object, which was also confirmed by the change in apparent
size as it significant in regard to its speed.  In order to maintain the same angular velocity in a muoh larger circle, its linear velocity must have been exceeding 700-900 miles per hour which appears to fall within the entirely reasonable range of speeds associated with air craft although the increasing its orbit, therefore, it must have been accelerating rather than merely maintaining a constant velocity.
The motion of the sphere during the entire period of observation was noted for its irregularities.  Frequent changes of direction, speed and duration of these changes were apparently erratic.  Reversing, and there were no irregularities or deflections of travel which are irregularities usually associated with conventional aircraft.  It is impossible for any physical, to act in such a manner without intelligent, artificial control.
Though not a graduate physicist, I am familiar with the general principles of aerodynamics, and nothing in the experience proved otherwise.  A plane closely maneuvering at such a speed would certainly be torn apart, and conventional aircraft are presented static to allow precise and definite changes of position and optical conditions, nor that its motion continued for a relatively long period of time.  It is remarkable that to an obvious theory of propulsive action.
For the record, in this connection, that we saw the object against varying backgrounds of dark mountains in the distance, blue sky, and thin bank of cumulus clouds, which of a brownish material object, contrasting it light against the terrain, relatively dark.
On one previous occasion while flying with another pilot, I had seen what I believe may well have been a fabrication phenomenon (I was unable to point it out to the pilot).  It appeared as a bright spark at a distance and then suddenly took off, on a northerly heading, at a speed of several times the speed of any jet aircraft and suddenly took off, disappears.

ATTN: 6004th AISS, Det #1

In compliance with FEAR Letter AG 350.07, dated 5 March 1952 and in connection with investigation by 6004th AISS, the following report of an Unidentified Object is submitted: 

1. Object was first sighted flying near deck of T-6 aircraft at approximately 10:30. Object was amber in color with a very distinct outline. Object appeared to be under control. There were no aerodynamic features such as wings, tail or fuselage observed. The object maintained a constant velocity of approximately 100 MPH (estimated) at an altitude of approximately 13,000 feet, heading North then turned and headed South again.  It orbited the aircraft at a distance of 1/2 to 1 mile. The object then made a very high speed pull-up, climbing almost vertically to an estimated altitude of 60,000 feet in a matter of seconds. There was no sound from the object.

2. Object was under observation for approximately 5 to 7 minutes.

3. Observation was visual, air to air from a T-6 aircraft flying at 10,500 feet. 130 miles per hour. Air Force issue sun glasses were worn by the observer. No optical devices were used.  

4. Object was at GR 6554.55 on initial sighting, flying close to the ground. It climbed to an altitude of 13,000 feet when the observers lost sight of it. 

5. Pilot was First Lieutenant Layton S. Baus who has flown 54 missions in Korea and the observer was First Lieutenant Richard A. Johnson. Observations of both are accepted as completely reliable.

All witnesses listed below were at the same vantage point.

3. Observations Visual.

4. Five (5) observers at Lumberton, N. C. saw the object passing from north to south. 

Reporting Officer's evaluation of reliability of observers: No higher than Fair.

6. Weather report taken from Weather Squadron, Pope Air Force Base, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, at 1652002. Winds calm, clouds clear, 230°-27 knots-14,000 feet.
No precipitation. Visibility: 10 miles.

7. Sunset was officially listed at 1623102 in the Fort Bragg area with the sun setting brightly before dark. There was no other meteorological activity.

A/10 @ 1623007, had seen an object identified as a jet plane flying at a high altitude from northeast to southwest and the sun shining on it caused it to be an odd color.

At the same time, observed a jet plane south of Fayetteville at a high altitude giving off a short vapor trail. He said that the trail did not seem to extend behind the plane as usual.

Further information on what is believed to be the same jet aircraft flight, as mentioned above, can be found by referring to Flyobropot 18-OPS CL,332, Commanding.

September 12, 1952

Dear Major Tucker:

This letter is from the Air Technical Intelligence Center, stating that a U.F.O. was seen in the general vicinity of this station on September 12, 1952.

It is significant because it was at 2:44 this afternoon near this center and witnessed by two civilian investigators of the center, who have had extensive experience with a number of "flying saucers," and manned "Cirthon".

The statement is dated this date, and signed that, "witnesses of the United States Air Force were witnesses to this incident, and this is proof positive of their validity and consistency, in view of the fact they are excellent and constant observers."

I would appreciate moving all available details concerning the UFO report mentioned in ATIC's letter to you. I feel that it will do to research the above-mentioned sighting, as continued in Project Bluebook, the latest reports.

Sincerely,

- page 125 -

Here is the text from the document:

6 October 1959

Dear Mr [redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 30 September concerning an Unidentified Flying Object sighting of 20 November 1952.

The only UFO sighting on that date which was reported to the Air Force was one which has been identified as Salton Sea flare. There is no connection between the Salton Sea sighting and the one reported by Mr. Adamsit's sighting obviously has no connection with Mr. Adamsit's sighting.

We do not have the facilities, funds, or personnel to reproduce records for dissemination to private groups or individuals. In lieu thereof, I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense press release on this subject.

Sincerely,

Major Lawrence J. Tacher, USAF
Public Information Division 
Office of Information 
Department of the Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

Dear Major Tacher:

Thank you for your letters dated October 6, 1959 and October 14, 1959. I would like to comment on the details of the Salton Sea, Calif. UFO report of November 26, 1957 which I had discussed with you as they seem to contain certain discrepancies.

Thank you for the press release No. 705-59.

Are your October 14 letters meant to be copies of the latest APRO bulletin. If so, I would like to know if you could provide me with an additional copy of the latest APRO bulletin. With the revision of any APRO, I APRO 220-2, there are two other APRI's mentioned: they are APRO 220-1 and APRO 505-1. If these documents are not classified, may I have copies of them?

Would you know of any way at all that I could at least borrow a copy of APRO 148 for a few days? As it is "out of print" I realize the problem involved, but I am badly in need of the information contained in the defense of USAF officers that could be loaned to me for a few days if some can be parted with, with the understanding that UNO research will be in the strictest confidence.

Is the statement that each UFO investigation costs the USAF $10,000.00 correct? It was attributed to an unnamed USAF spokesman during the UFO "flap" of November 1, 1957.

Also during November, 1957, a Colonel Dean Hess, USAF, apparently an associate or public made a public demand that the "AG" occasionally investigate UFOs, instead of brushing them off, as it had done in the past. This was reported by the Associated Press. What AF later did in regard to this situation, and was any progress made for this statement? If not, on what grounds was he reprimanded, if he was reprimanded.

Yours for sincere research,
[Signature redacted]

The image does not contain any photograph or visual information. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

30 October 1959

Dear Mr.

This is to acknowledge your letter of 17 October 1959 concerning UFOs. 

The United States Air Force had a UFO sighting on 20 November 1952, a 25 miles east of Selton Sea in California. AAMS's Mcclellan AFB pilot case was that the pilot saw a weather balloon at approximately 15,000' altitude. There were other 3-50 type aircraft in the air but none of the other pilots reported seeing a UFO. No radar reports of this sighting were received.

There is absolutely no connection between the Air Force sighting of 20 November 1952 and the popular science fiction writer, but this has never presented any of his claims to the USAF.

In answer to your other question, Air Force regulations maintain a minimum processing time to refute changes in procedure or policy. As requested, I am enclosing AFR 95-17 and AFR 200-2.

As previously stated, the only way I know that you can read the JANAP 146 is to visit this office.

The statement that each UFO investigation costs the USAF $10,000 is a commonly accepted misconception. The actual cost would vary in cost based upon the circumstances surrounding the sighting and the extent of the investigation.

This office has no knowledge of the statement attributed to Colonel Dean Hess or of a reprimand received by Colonel Hess as a result thereof.

Interrogation of Eye Witnesses
BOX 433, FLOV 4350100

SUMMARY (Summarize the cases, give location, time, date, other pertinent data as paragraph.)
Fanning, Georgia at approximately 5:00 hours on the morning of 9 December 1952, observers at the Post Gate reported seeing an unidentified object in the sky. The object was described as approximately the size of a B-29 aircraft, round in shape, and emitting a bright yellow light. It appeared to be hovering at approximately 1,000 feet for about two minutes and then disappeared to the south-south-east at a very high rate of speed.

1. All observers seemed certain it was neither a meteor nor a fixed astronomical body; nor was it an aircraft of any kind. The object was observed by three men on sentry duty at the Gate, and one other observer from the Post.

2. The weather was very good, with ceiling and visibility unlimited.

3. As far as can be ascertained by this Headquarters only five people saw this object.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Air Attache, India IR-194-52 Page 1 of 1

GERMAN LEGION FLYING SAUCER

"One of the German Legion associations which have been active before the war and are now looking up again in the aeronautical research field. 

"This association was formerly responsible for several original designs of dirigible-type aircraft in Germany prior to 1939 and during the war, including some which were proposed for some of the German saucer-type planes."

"Now the brains of the association have produced a design for a revolutionary type of aircraft which might look remarkably like possible saucer-type."

"The new design is shared like a flattened disc with a large central opening surrounded by a ring. It is said to show remarkable similarity to the disc or disc-like shapes of the objects often seen or described of the aircraft."

"For the time being, the original constructed model is carefully guarded at the residence of the association members, and experts of the research association say that it has great advantages over orthodox aircraft, particularly in maneuverability and stability."

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch depicts a curved line representing the horizon, and an object above the horizon line with rays or a trail of some kind extending outwards. The text below this sketch states "NO CURVE IN MOVEMENT!".

The second sketch shows a larger panoramic view with a person standing on a road, and two smaller inset sketches - one showing a curved road leading up to a mountain, and the other showing a person standing and looking at an object in the sky.

As an OCR system, the text I can extract from the document is:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position where you first saw the object, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The following report was received from field grade officer assigned
to this activity:

While returning to White Sands Proving Ground from the Roswell
Hospital, we approached a brilliantly-lighted object on 25 November 1952. I observed
what appeared to be flares, or pyrotechnics, on the right side of the
object. The object was about the size of a C-47, and it was making a
a matter of seconds - I observed what appeared to be a flare land right
in the middle of the object, about three or four hundred yards distant.
It assumed the shape of a ball, having a green center, fading to a
light hazy blue at the periphery. This light disappeared before my
car arrived at the object. When the Department of the Army had a new
type pyrotechnics that I was unfamiliar with. Approximately three to
five minutes later I observed a 11-15, or series of 11 lights, approaching
from the same direction of the object. In the heavens, at an altitude of
about three to four hundred feet and between 1/4 and 1/2 mile distant.
I should have provided provisions in this report so it might be a 1-19
or a C-123. However, this object made a right hand turn above the road
and then disappeared as an angle of approximately 70 degrees, straight
into the sky. I can not state whether it was a plane or a type of
aircraft, because I can not readily identify aircraft. These appeared
to be two separate objects, the initial one stationary about the size
were five to six feet in height and six to eight windows in each of
the two rows. After this object disappeared, I returned my car and got
out to see if I could see a plane but could see nothing. I turned off
the motor on my car to see if I could hear the motors plane but I
could hear no sound. I then proceeded to White Sands Proving Ground.

STATEMENT

The incident occurred while I was returning from an official flight from El Paso, Texas, in a T-33 type aircraft at 10,000 feet altitude. Visual flight rules. I was departing the Albuquerque AFB 16 minutes after 12:00 noon, 27 November 1952, in a T-33 type aircraft equipped with 400 gallons of fuel (Magnetic Heading 103 degrees). I observed four quick bursts of black smoke, approximately two miles distant, from the aircraft, and at the same altitude. As I was approaching my check point, the Payson Homer, I noted the time to be approximately 12:14. The smoke puffs appeared in rapid succession for a period of about 10 to 15 seconds. There were no aircraft visible at that time. I turned to the left to better observe the smoke, and it appeared to be coming from a point approximately four miles distant, and at the same altitude. I at first thought it may have been the exhausts of another aircraft. We watched them for a minute or two, and then they disappeared. The tower controller at Albuquerque AFB advised me they had not observed the puffs. He replied in the affirmative and asked if I thought they were from another aircraft. The condition was not normal for jet-type aircraft, and did have somewhat the appearance of small explosions or possible emergency situation or mayday calls. There was no transmission heard, and no other aircraft were observed in that area. After observing the four rapid puffs, this time changing course to our left, approximately one minute later a rapid 90 degree turn in the direction of the puffs occurred, which would have taken the aircraft behind the aircraft. I immediately made a rapid 90 degree turn in the direction the puffs were observed for a better look, which would have taken me behind the aircraft. No other aircraft were observed making any turns at that time. The entire incident covered a twenty minute period. At no time did we observe any contrails or conditions which would have indicated the puffs for clouds as the atmospheric condition was perfectly clear, with only one small cloud hovering over a mountain some distance away. The best description which I can offer is that they would identify these puffs with black smoke, and the succession which occurred would indicate some type of emergency or military operation. The incident was observed over a twenty five mile course extending from a point approximately nine miles northeast of the Payson Homer to a point directly over the Payson Homer. The aircraft was flown directly over the Payson Homer.

STATEMENT

On 27 November 1952 in a return trip from a cross country with Lt. Colonel McCaskill we both witnessed what appeared to be smoke on the horizon. The smoke seemed to be coming from out of the sky of about 2 or 3 puffs at a time, then as we would approach the area puffs of the same black smoke would appear again to dissipate in front of us. I told Colonel McCaskill it appears to be smoke from a crash, but we were unable to see any type aircraft or about the time we would approach the smoke we would encounter much rough turbulence and we made several 90 degree turns to find the smoke, this went on for about twenty minutes and we made several 90 degree turns to find the smoke puffs behind us. This report is accurate to the best of my knowledge.

SUBJECT: Incident in the Vicinity of Oeming Reservoir, New Mexico, on November 2, 1952

REFERENCE: Your letter dated [ILLEGIBLE] November, 1952, requesting certain information regarding the above subject.

This incident was investigated by Project GRUDGE and the following is a summary of the findings:

A USAF officer reported that at approximately 1:00 A.M. on November 2, 1952, he observed a glowing object in the sky while driving near Deming Reservoir, New Mexico. The object appeared to be round and glowing, and was observed for about 30 seconds before it suddenly disappeared. The officer was unable to determine the size, distance, or altitude of the object.

A check of available meteorological data for the area indicated no unusual atmospheric conditions which could account for the sighting. An investigation of the area failed to reveal any evidence of the object's having landed. No other witnesses were found.

This incident was analyzed and evaluated by Project GRUDGE, and it was concluded that the object was probably a meteor or some other natural aerial phenomenon. No further investigation is planned.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

PERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL

Headquarters, United States Air Force, Directorate of Intelligence, Washington, D.C.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

1. Reference is made to previous correspondence on the subject of unidentified flying objects. Recent information received indicates that the subject of unidentified flying objects continues to be of interest both to the public and certain elements of the United States Government. 

2. While there have been a number of reported sightings which could not be readily explained, the majority of such reports have been found to be either misidentification of familiar objects or the result of psychological factors operating on the observer. A small percentage, however, have remained unexplained. These unexplained sightings have been carefully analyzed and various scientific factors have been considered in an effort to determine their nature.

3. During the course of the investigation of these unexplained sightings, it has been found that a considerable amount of detailed information has been accumulated, much of which is of a technical and classified nature. It has been determined that the continued collection and analysis of this type of information is desirable in the interests of national security.

4. Accordingly, it is requested that you designate a qualified officer or officers within your headquarters to serve as a liaison point of contact with this Directorate on matters pertaining to unidentified flying objects. The purpose of this liaison will be to insure the prompt and complete exchange of information on this subject which may be of mutual interest and concern.

     Very truly yours,

as follows:

Dear Sir,

In the close pass there is an interesting Flying Saucer report in which you are mentioned as one of the persons who encountered the Saucers while at College and since college some 8-9 years ago. An individual who says he saw such sightings has recently showed me his Saucer show and told how he and you had your Saucer magic classes and that you have since tried out his theories with colored glass, I have since had him over again and this time he says all he would not believe the theories. Reg ardless, Durt was camped on a Mountain in New Mexico and Saw a film light at first disregarded as fire crackers and in a little while the light passed across Carolo bus stops recording. It lasted the brief time the light was visible but no more. This light was white and illuminated itself intermittently and Durt claims that he alerted several to look Close to it, most of them were skeptics but 7 gathered up there that were only part y curious, and brought them back with me. I noticed the Collection in Washington I had saw call:.

I heard nothing from them, but a Russian Scientists from the U.S.S.R. embassy did come and they came half of one of these objects, it was so hard we had to use a bridge hammer to break it in two.

In the center was a round Hole or Vacuum, filled with fine powder this Scientists screened every bit of this they were sure was a Bomb, in claims the object was Uranium and the vacuum was proven hermetically sealed. 

I am just telling you what he sa_ because I don't Claim to know all I know is what I saw and saw.

I think all this flying saucer is 99% illusion.

Respectfully Yours

AT PRIONA, TEXAS:

Mr. and Mrs. N.S. Prioria, Priona, Texas, were interviewed and Mr. Prioria advised that he was a retired farmer. He stated that he had a always been interested in meteorites ever since he took a correspondence course concerning meteors some 50 years ago.

He stated that in the spring of 1952 he was traveling in the eastern part of Sma Miguel County, New Mexico, with his wife when he found a large deposit of a previously unknown type of material. He stated that this material resembled a type of this metal and brought it back to his home.

In the above letter that he saw the material fall but stated that he did not remember whether such information is the letter and emphatically stated that he did not see the material fall to the earth.

and returned to Priona, Texas, he wrote to Senator LYNDON B. JOHNSON of Texas and Senator CLIFFORD J. DUSON of New Mexico concerning the material. He stated that both Senators forwarded his letter to the Office of Naval Research and the Air Materiel Command at Dayton, Ohio. He stated that he sent samples of this material to the Chemical Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona, and stated that they replied advising him that the material was not of a meteorite but was still in possession of all this correspondence but stated that he had destroyed it all.

He was then asked if he could read the writer's credentials, and he replied that they were in English. He stated that he could not place the time or date this alleged individual with the exception of the fact that it was some time prior to his sending the material from the Russian Consulate.

He stated that he was no longer in possession of any of the unknown material inasmuch as he had recently given.

DESCRIPTION
Like a loaf of French bread, almost black objects shaped the right of the tower and one to the left of the tower.

(A) The object at the left then started rising slightly to the left and stopped above the tower. The object at the right at this moment, when the object at the left started rising to the right, it quietly moved to the left and seemed to merge (B) with the first object, then the object moved down and to the right in a straight line, moving somewhat like it was on an escalator, down to a position (C), a little more to the right between (1) and (2).

Between (C) and (D), Mr. [REDACTED] and the others came in. This was about 10:31.

The object did not stop at C, it just slowed down. Then, from position (C), the object started very unusual gyrations, leaving smoke trails. The object did this time-changing curved forms at all times. At one time it looked like a coin slowly revolving, at one time like a bean bag that had been encapsulated, billowing out and disintegrating, something like that. The one thing that all the observers agreed on was that the diameter of the object and the diameter of the Moon were about the same.

As the object became more circular, it appeared darker (almost black), and then it would expand until it equal to the long side, becoming a circle. As the object became more circular it appeared darker (almost black), when it was more the shape of the loaf of bread.

One of the observers said it was gray and Mr. [REDACTED] said they saw dark irregular streaks running through the object, but this was not verified by the others.

The object then careened to the ground and disappeared (D). (E) It was about the size of the spot the object disappeared. A little closer to the tower, at a spot on the horizon more than 1/3 the distance between (1) and (2), there appeared what seemed to be smoke, billowing (similar to smoke from a large factory smokestacks). This smoke then appeared to form into an object, like a cubelike shape.

This image does not contain any visible photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. The text describes the movement and appearance of the object, including its apparent disappearance and reappearance, as well as the observations made by the witnesses. The document mentions a Mr. [ILLEGIBLE] and refers to the objects being verified by another individual.

Text extracted from the document:

the loaf of bread. The object then moved up and to the left, disappearing from view. The object was over the tower it disappeared; then a trail of smoke appeared, going up and to the right, seeming to indicate the object was disappearing from view. This smoke trail appeared from time to time, and then disappeared entirely. It seemed to the observers that the disappearance had occurred because the object had returned to a distance where it could not be followed. The object reappeared rather slowly when it could be followed. The smoke trails were observed by Dr. [ILLEGIBLE] and thus was substantiated (although not as positively) by Mrs. [ILLEGIBLE].

Mr. [ILLEGIBLE] states (and it was verified by Mr. [ILLEGIBLE]) that he watched the objects from 10:32 to approximately 10:45.

The text in the document is as follows:

FROM: Asst Air Division (Defense) 
TO: Air Inteligentce Information Report

(1) Shape: Disc
Speed: Radar target from 0.5 to 275 knots. 
Color: Orange.
Approad: Stationary in space to 1500 mph. 
Maneuvers: Just hovered, then disappeared in 2-3 seconds.
Other Factors: Negative. 

(2) Approximately 1005 MDTS. 

(3) Electronic Observation A/FPRC-3 PPI Scope.

(4) ADOZ Building. 767th ACRS Squadron, Tinian Marianas, New Mexico.

(5) Observer's reliability considered excellent. Technical representative's electronic knowledge considered superior to military observers knowledge.

(6) Clear weather and normal field conditions.
(7), (8), and (10) All Negative. 

(9) Radar frequency was changed by 20 MC and object still appeared on scope. The information given above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and ability.

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER: 
As stated by the two military observers on duty at the scope, this phenomenon may have been interference from another radar set in the area. The approximate bearing to the other station is 252 degrees. The appearance appears to be similar to that of the 767th ACRS Squadron. It is believed this sighting cannot be explained as interference from another radar, since it is not uncommon and all observers have had considerable experience with radar interference. It is not believed this sighting can be explained as interference.

This image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document. There is no photograph present on this particular page. The text on the page is handwritten, and it appears to be a continuation of some previous comments or observations.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output the full text from the document:

At first it appeared to the witness a rather briskly moving object, irregularly round and moving at high speed, which apparently changed position and shape as it moved. This change in position and shape, and shape, and direction of movement, was so rapid that the witness could not say definitely whether it was one object or a group of small objects. The witness is an elderly and very intelligent person, sure in his judgment, and his observation was not influenced by imagination or any other external factor. He feels it was an extremely unusual phenomenon, quite different from any aircraft or natural celestial body. It was observed for 4 or 5 minutes and was of great interest and excitement to the witness. He was impressed also by the complete and mysterious silence of the phenomenon. He viewed it as a craft or crafts of unearthly origin.

SWORN STATEMENT
20 November 1952

1. Frederick Cavil's radar observed on the 221 scope of the AW/FPS-3 radar station at Hanscom Field (Bedford), Massachusetts, on 30 November 1952, at approximately 0100 hours, as follows:

It was a target about fifteen degrees in width appeared southeast of this station. 
It moved away from the station at a speed approximately 600 knots, where the above mentioned scope is located. Into the operations room to find out if the target was the same as that observed and reported by the Weather Observation Section. After observing the target on the scope at the operations room, it was found that the target was picking up signals unrelated to air travel or four aspect of the antenna. It returned to the maintenance room.
There is no indication that the operator has corrected this target as an unidentified object. At the maintenance room, it was decided to change the frequency to determine whether or not this target was a result of interference from one of the other units. After the frequency was changed, the target was still there, the same as before the frequency was changed.
When F/Sgt Cavil arrived at the maintenance room, I was concentrating on determining whether what I saw was actually a target or interference. I am convinced that it was not interference from another radar.

At first I thought it was a rather remarkable form of an unusual nature and description of movement, as it did appear to be a dark massive object with a perimelinical and erratic movement, somewhat of a jagged vertical and horizontal path which seemed to be of a somewhat erratic nature. I cannot determine at this time as to whether it was an aircraft or some other type of machine. But it did produce a dark and massive effect which seemed to only coincide with a small dimension of a sphere type appearance. This is all that I can say with any positive assurance at the present moment. As to the nature of the object, I cannot determine.

This page from the Project Blue Book document contains a photograph of an airship or unidentified flying object (UFO). The image appears to be a black and white photograph of an elongated, cigar-shaped object in the sky.

The text in the document reads as follows:

I, James H. McCauslin Jr., Captain, USAF, A-1435732, do hereby make the following statement and is true to the best of my knowledge.

On the 9th of November 1952 at 1800 P.M. I was notified by the 2108th Air Base Squadron on the telephone that a person had reported a strange object in the sky over Donaldson Air Force Base, Greenville, South Carolina. This person stated that a silver object was seen shortly after darkness and that it was maneuvering and hovering at an altitude of approximately 1,000 to 1,500 feet. The object appeared to be of large size, approximately 30 to 40 feet in length, and cylindrical in shape. It was observed for approximately 10 minutes and then disappeared.

I immediately proceeded to the area to investigate. However, upon my arrival the object had already disappeared. This sighting was reported to authorities for further investigation.

The above statement is true to the best of my knowledge. I have been in radar 32 months and have been familiar with the appearance of various objects in the sky. I am quite familiar with the appearance of meteorites and am quite familiar with my work.
