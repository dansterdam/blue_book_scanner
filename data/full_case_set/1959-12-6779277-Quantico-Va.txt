Marines Seeking Flying Saucers Find New Aviation Light

QUANTICO, VA., JAN. 5 - The Marines here have been on the alert the past five nights, and several times they have seen strange lights in the sky, which they suspect may have been flying saucers.

The lights, described as bright and flashing on and off in an unusual pattern, were seen by marine guards at the Quantico Marine base during the late evening hours starting last Friday night.

The lights, Marines said, seemed to come and go and at times were visible for several minutes at a stretch. 

The last time the lights were seen was on Monday night. The Marines said the lights appeared for about five minutes and then disappeared.

The Marines said the lights did not resemble any conventional aircraft. They said the lights were not like those of any plane or helicopter they had ever seen before.

One marine said the lights seemed to dart across the sky at high speed and then suddenly stop and hover for several minutes.

The sightings, the Marines said, were reported immediately to higher headquarters and to the Air Force. However, no official investigation has been ordered so far.

Similar reports of strange lights and flying objects in the vicinity of Quantico have been received from civilians living in the area.

No other details were available, except that the Marines said the lights were real and that they were convinced they were not seeing things.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"The verdict: The witness had looked to the left towards the horizon, but it was merely instinctive reaction; she did not see anything unusual at that time. Today, the sighting was investigated and appeared to be a reflection from the water on the shore of Lake Erie.

As the witness talked on the sighting, the investigator was not convinced that the witness had seen anything unusual, but felt that the sighting had been exaggerated somewhat in the telling.

It was reported that the witness, Mrs. J.P. Poperkowitz, had a tendency to exaggerate stories, and the investigator felt that this sighting was another example of this tendency.

The next thing noticed, according to the witness, was a flash of light which appeared to be low on the horizon, apparently very bright, and which seemed to pass across the sky. The witness stated that this flash of light seemed to come from her left to her right and that it seemed to go very quickly, and only lasted an instant or so.

At the same time, the witness stated that she saw something dark pass in front of the light. She could not tell what this object was, but felt that it seemed to pass in front of the light flash about the same time the light flash occurred.

According to the witness, the next thing noticed was a small, glowing object that appeared to be hovering or "setting" on the water. The witness stated that this object seemed to be about 1000 yards away from her position and that she could see it clearly, as the area was well illuminated by the street lights.

The witness described the object as being round and glowing, and stated that she could not tell whether or not it had any other features, as the glow was the most noticeable characteristic. The witness stated that this object remained in the same position on the water for about 5 minutes, and then suddenly disappeared.

The witness, Mrs. J.P. Poperkowitz, and Mr. J.P. Poperkowitz, the witness' husband, were interviewed at their home at 8:30 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. respectively on the same date as the sighting. The investigators felt that the witness was telling the truth as she saw it, but that she tended to exaggerate stories and that the sighting was not as unusual as she described it.

It is the opinion of the investigators that this sighting was merely a reflection from the water on the shore of Lake Erie, and that the witness, in the excitement of the moment, exaggerated what she saw."

1 JANUARY 1954, QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

From the air base at Quantico, Virginia, on the nights of 1 and 2 February 1954, a military and civilian ground observer reported seeing an unidentified flying object pass over the area. The object was described as a flashing red light, dome shaped and appearing to be the size of a grapefruit at arms length.
The object flew a relatively straight and level course and was visible for 5 or 6 minutes.

An aircraft was scrambled in an attempt to pursue the light. The aircraft intercepted an American Air Lines' Convair. In addition to the intercept, an ATIC officer proceeded to Quantico and observed this same light from the ground.

The reported light was definitely identified as being a Grimes Beacon light. These have recently been installed on several civilian passenger aircraft.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a newspaper clipping with a text article. The article is titled "Marines Chase Flying Object With 'Copter" and describes how two Marines at Camp Lejeune, Virginia reported seeing a mysterious flying object that was chased by a helicopter.

Marines Chase Flying Object With 'Copter
Two Sentries Report Seeing Mystery Craft In Sky Near Quantico
Camp Lejeune, Va., Dec. 5. - Two marines here reported seeing a mysterious flying object in the sky near Quantico, Va., on New Year's Eve but armed forces officials could get no other information on the incident.
The marines, who are sentries on duty at Camp Lejeune, said they saw the strange object being chased by a helicopter.
They said the flying object was observed passing over a nearby marine base and then descending toward land. The officer of the day said it had disappeared when the helicopter returned to the marine base.
The report said it that two platoons of officers and men were sent out to search for the object but this was denied by an official spokesman.
Statements were taken from the marines and the copter pilot but were in the hands of intelligence.
Stationed off the base on pass last night, the two sentries were unable to supply their report on the actions of the object, or their reports on its actions.
No further information was reported before high officers of the Marine Corps could make any statements on the incident.

The image appears to contain a photograph of a man, likely Maj. Charles E. Yeager, who is holding a model of an aircraft. The caption below the image states that Maj. Yeager is telling Lawrence D. Bell, president of Bell Aircraft, about his flight record that was disclosed during a news conference at the Pentagon the previous day.

The text output is as follows:

WASHINGTON. Dec. 13 (P) -- Maj. Charles E. Yeager, the Air Force test pilot who last month broke the sound barrier, said yesterday he reached a speed of 1,650 miles an hour in his X-1 rocket-powered aircraft.  
Physically, there is no sensation," Yeager said in a news conference in the Pentagon. "Actually, you wouldn't know you've broken the sound barrier unless you had an instrument."  
  
Pilot Tells  
Of Flight at  
1,600M.P.H.  
  
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 (AP) --  
Maj. Charles E. Yeager, who made the first flight to crack the sound barrier, said today he reached a top speed of 1,650 miles an hour in his X-1 rocket-powered plane.  
Yeager said the 35-29 seconds it takes the plane to climb to 50,000 feet is "a great experience."  
He fired off three of the four rockets in the plane on the record flight that was disclosed yesterday. Yeager said it climbed in sort of an arc, leveled off and then "went straight up and shot if off.'  
He retained his maximum speed for an instant before he shut off the power.  
Peering from the cockpit, he said: "My eyeballs sure got back when those rocket motors went off."  
The Air Force announced yesterday that Maj. Yeager has set a new speed record of 1,650 miles an hour, breaking the old record of 671 miles an hour set by an American test pilot last month.

1. While on a trip to the Director of Intelligence in connection with Project Green Book, Lt. Col. Glassboak was requested by Lt Col Samford in Gen Samford's Office to proceed to Quantico Marine Base to investigate the report of flying saucers.

2. Photographic equipment was procured through Lt Col Tscher, Air Attache, and the command tower at the Marine Base Headquarters to evaluate the phenomena and if it was something explainable to give that to the Marine Corps. It was related to the press and it was something that could not be contributed to natural causes, the Marines were to be given a copy of the written report at a later date.

3. (3.1) (Classified) on 14 July 54 investigating a flyung object going to the Tank Park in the Guadarcanal Area and reporting to Maj Ferguson, Marine 323, that the following: At 1945 hours, a Marine corporal reported that the phenomena was reappearing again. (3.2) (Classified) and (Maj) Ferguson phenomenon custodialr and observed a flashing red light which appeared in the north and passed over the northwest section of the Danger Area in a southeasterly direction. It was radioly suspected that this was the Grimshaw Base on a commercial air liner. Maj Glassbrook could see both wing tip identification lights at one time, in addition to the Grimshaw Base. This information was given to Maj Ferguson and, at a later time, released to the press.

4. Attached is a copy of the press release which appeared in the 5 January 1954 edition of the Evening Star.

5. This information was relayed to Gen Samford's Office upon Maj Glassbrook's return to the Washington Area.

LIGHTS: INTERCEPTED ONE AMERICAN AIR LINES CONVAIR, FLIGHT 422, WHICH LANDED AT WASHINGTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. FLT 422 WAS INTERCEPTED AT 1910Z JAN 54. FLT 422 WAS 7 MILES SOUTHEAST OF WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT AT TIME OF INTERCEPTION.
11. CHECKED WITH ALL ADJACENT AGENCIES. OTHER THAN FLT 422, NO OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF SIGHTING.
12. COL. U.S.A.F. DIRECTOR AND RATED AIRCRAFT OBSERVER: MY ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION IS THAT THE UNKNOWN OBJECTS COULD POSSIBLE BE AIRCRAFT LANDING TO THE NORTH AT WASHINGTON, MAKING A PATTERN THAT WOULD TAKE THEM PAST THE SOUTH OF A POINT AT RADAR-55 WEST LONGITUDE 77.49' AND NORTH LATITUDE 38.45', THEIR GOING IN A QUARTER CIRCLE PATTERN TOWARDS WASHINGTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. IN THIS PATTERN THE RED PART NAVIGATION LIGHT WOULD BE TOWARDS OBSERVER UNTIL PASSING OUT OF SITE ON HORIZON. IN REFERENCE TO ITEM 12 ON COMPLETION OF THE INTERCEPT I CHECKED WITH WASHINGTON INTERNATIONAL AND THEY STATED THAT IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS A RED FLASHING ANTI COLLISION LIGHT HAS BEEN INSTALLED ON SEVERAL CIVILIAN PASSENGER AIRCRAFT. I BELIEVE THAT THESE LIGHTS COULD POSSIBLY BE CAUSING THE SIGHTINGS OF THE RED FLASHING OBJECT.

The text in the image is as follows:

"WHAT THOSE QUANTICO MARINES SAW--What seems to be a series of lights here is the same light, in a 10-minute lapse, as Washington National Airport sightings. The dispopitional said: 2 Marine gunners of 25,000 feet, so why are the plane's other lights the flashing light, intelligence officers said, is what Marines at Quantico"
