NAME:

SIGNAL CODE:

DATE: 8 July 1953 

Upon stepping outside of enclosed porch at about 6:15PM, attention was directed upward by a passing personal plane. The object was of such brilliance that it was immediately noted above and ahead of the plane which was flying NNW. The three others of my family were called and also observed the object. At this time it was stationary. After the plane passed, the object moved rapidly upward at high speed, turned to the south at a sharp angle and continued to move away rapidly finally disappeared either because of distance or in the clouds. Clouds were lower in the south than over Tipp City.

"Flying Disk"
Story Studied
AT Officers Ponder
Tipp Man's Report

Still unsolved and still a subject of study by Air Technical Intelligence Center officers at Wright-Patterson Air FOrce base is the report of a "flying saucer' seen by a Tipp City man July 3.

The man, Wilbur H. Focht, a Wright-Patterson employe, has returned a questionnaire sent him and has been interviewed personally on the incident, according to the ATIC.

"All we know thus far," said a spokesman," is that the object might have been a weather balloon."

Though a check revealed that no balloon was up from this area at the time, he said, the object could have been an upper air research balloon from another section of the country.

Focht told the officials he saw the object when he stepped outside his Tipp City home about 6:45 p.m. It was stationary at an altitude higher than a plane which was flying overhead at the time.

After the plane was gone, Focht said, the object moved upward, turned south and, moving rapidly, vanished behind a cloud bank.
