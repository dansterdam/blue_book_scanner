10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
    One (1) round, brilliant white object, larger 
    than any star in the sky, appeared for approx 
    20 seconds and then faded out. Object appear- 
    ed to move in a southerly direction at an 
    unknown speed. No sound.

11. COMMENTS
   Although no sound was heard in connec- 
   tion with the sighting, the brevity of 
   the sighting coupled with the brilliant 
   white color and the fade out indicates 
   the possibility of an after-burner 
   equipped aircraft F-94, F-95, etc. No 
   investigation authorized.

      Probably Balloon
      Possibly Balloon
