There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text visible in the document:

"THEY CAME ABOUT 15 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND SEEMED TO BE LANDED IN FIELD ABOUT 130 FEET AWAY FROM THE OBSERVER AT A POINT JUST BEHIND SOME TREES ON THE FARM. THEY WERE SORT OF ROUND AND SHAPE LIKE HALF-MOON OR SAUCER. THE COLOR OF THE CRAFT WAS DULL GRAY AND LOOKED VERY BRIGHT ON THE UNDER SURFACE. I COULD SEE NO MARKINGS OR WINDOWS ON THE CRAFT. IT APPEARED TO BE RESTING ON LEGS OR SOME KIND OF LANDING GEAR. IT SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY SILENT AND MADE NO NOISE. THE CRAFT APPEARED TO BE OCCUPIED BY 4 OCCUPANTS WHO SEEMED TO BE EXAMINING A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT THAT WAS RESTED ON A TRIPOD. AFTER ABOUT 5 TO 7 MINUTES, THE CRAFT TOOK OFF STRAIGHT UP AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT IN JUST SECONDS. THERE WAS NO FLAME OR EXHAUST OBSERVED. I DID NOT SEE ANY WINDOWS OR DOORS ON THE CRAFT WHILE IT WAS ON THE GROUND."

Just was me standraa on he edoe of he highway and saine some lirnt objects up In the sky. They appeared ro be to erge for aeroplanes and I wes told that they wore stsrs. However some three of them appeared to be glmag off the grounu and I saw thes glee alowly up and then fall quickly to the ground seaet sny eaplosion or noise. Another time I was flying in an airplane and I saw three objects that appeared suddenly and then disappearad just as suddenly. They appeared to be like lights similar to the lights on sn airplane but they had no wing or tail and they moved at a speed thet I could not comprehend. Another time I was driving alone and suddenly three objects appeared in the sky and they jast seemed to stay stationary for a few seconde and then suddenly moved off at a terrific speed, first one way and then another at speeds that seemed incredible to me. Also there seems ro be a lot of activity at night in the sky over this area and many people have reported seting strange objects. I cannot give you any more specific details on this as I have only seen thee things a few times and my observations are limited. But I am convinced that there is something going on up there that we do not understand.

The city was relatively quiet with normal traffic flow. I had been out for a walk when I observed a round, glowing object in the sky above the city. It appeared to be stationary at first, then it suddenly accelerated and moved rapidly out of sight. There was no sound associated with the object. I was unable to determine its precise size or distance, but it seemed to be approximately 1/2 to 1 mile away. The object was round in shape and glowed with an orange-reddish color. It remained in view for only a brief period, perhaps 30 seconds, before rapidly disappearing.

It was the sight of my lifetime, the clearest and sharpest. The outline was perfect, it glowed and pulsated every few seconds, but remained stationary. The size seemed to be as a large star or small planet, with a slight trail of discoloration behind it, something like shooting sparks.
I believe was the view of the object.
It was solid, not transparent, and seemed to be hovering at a point of altitude.
It maintained this hovering position for a short time, then disappeared in a flash, leaving no trace.

As I was coming home from work about 7:30 pm, I witnessed an unusual and beautiful looking object in the sky. It was circular in shape, reddish in color, and seemed to be moving at a steady rate. At first I thought it was a small airplane, but then I noticed that it was much brighter and larger than any aircraft I had ever seen. As I continued to watch, the object suddenly accelerated at an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. I have no reasonable explanation for what I saw, but I can say with certainty that it was not a conventional aircraft or anything I have ever seen before. I am a credible witness and I am unsure of the significance of this incident, but I felt it was important to report what I observed."

The height came from below that the thing only and bright. The height came and went and high was. The light came and went like a flash and seemed as if a dull was appearing and a little was coming the light. the same solid got very bright very suddenly. I would like to say that it seemed like a perfect sphere. The color would be like a silver color and the edges sharp and clear. I would like it to explain that the same was an aircraft or an object that I was not able to recognize. It seemed again very that the small or light moved away. The center where the light crossed was a cleaner, darker phase, the outside was a lighter very clear then the inside. I'm not sure this is effect more with dawn or was coming up but it seemed there for a little while.

The object was a little higher than the tree-tops and while it seemed to stand still in the air, some distance, it lit up the whole countryside. A plane took off from the field and when it got near the object, the object disappeared. When the plane passed the object, the object reappeared. It was observed at 0530. Then two stars approached and the object went up and disappeared from sight.

Action Taken:
Contact with (name redacted)'s base (operations) revealed that several people were in the area shortly after 0530. Two US-6 took off about 0530. He had received no sightings nor heard of any.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subj: UFO Observation, 12 Jun, 0200 hours
Mrs. (redacted), Dayton, Ohio 45416 called the UFO station on 12 June 1967. They had been up at approximately 0200 hours when she looked up in the sky and saw what appeared to be a star moving. Observed object for approximately ten minutes, moving north to southeast. Looked like a star, but brighter. Zig-zagged and paused, also changed direction from south to southeasterly. She thought that maybe it was a satellite except that it changed direction slightly and zig-zagged. Explained that satellites give the appearance of a slight change in direction and that zig-zagging was also common in satellite observations due to the atmosphere. Told her I would send her some DVR forms 154 for her and the other witnesses to complete so that we could check thoroughly. She would like a reply as to whether a satellite was their at that time.
