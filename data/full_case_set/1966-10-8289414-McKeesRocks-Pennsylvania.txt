31 OCT â€¢
ABOUT 11 :30 PM on 8 OCTOBER 1966, A RESIDENT OF
MCKEESROCKS, PENNSYLVANIA, REPORTED SEEING AN
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN THE SKY. THE OBJECT
WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING ABOUT 30 FEET IN DIAMETER,
ORANGE IN COLOR, AND HOVERING ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE
THE GROUND. IT REMAINED STATIONARY FOR ABOUT 5
MINUTES, THEN SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED
TO THE EAST. THE OBSERVER STATED THAT, AS THE OBJECT
PASSED OVERHEAD, HE COULD HEAR A VERY FAINT HUMMING
SOUND. DURING THIS INCIDENT, THERE WAS AN APPARENT
POWER FAILURE IN PART OF THE AREA.

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely part of a Project Blue Book report.

OCR Output:
This object about 21-22 inches long, was at a height of about 400 yards from the observer. It seemed to be brightly lit and I could see the object very clearly. It was oval shaped, and I would say about 3 15 x 4 11 inches in size. The object seemed to be hovering and may have been slightly rotating. I never saw any signs of wings or propulsion and I heard no sound at all. It disappeared in a horizontal direction, and was gone from sight in about 2 to 3 seconds.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document, likely a report or observation related to a UFO incident.

As an OCR system, the text in the document is as follows:

"This was observed about 8:3 p.m. this date. Large object giving off varied colored lights, appeared to hover and change directions of flight, flying at a moderate speed. After 1/2 hour of observation this object departed, getting smaller and finally disappearing. Only one other witness who was a neighbor saw the same object and can verify my observation.

Clear at first appeared very low may have been a sapper much larger than my house, sometime it appeared to be a saucer shape and I could clearly see the lights on the underside changing color from red, green, and blue."

There is no photograph present in this image. The document appears to be handwritten text that reads as follows:

When the object appeared it maneuvered very fast, it left contrails. Some hazy about 6 to 2 miles in diameter. There seemed to be about 6 to 10 lights on the craft and they were too bright to be visible with the naked eye, they seemed to be flashing in a counterclockwise manner. The formation can best be described as a spinning top or similar to the motion of a French top.
