It hovered there for a while and then suddenly it seemed to go off like a shot. There was no sound. It was a distance away about a mile or like, the way it happened it would just go off like a shot. The following is a summary of a statement by Mr. [Redacted]: I have been quite a pessimist until I saw this. Description of object: It looked like a baseball, it was about the size of a baseball. It looked like it had hairs instead of being solid. It was quite a distance away, the color was about the color of the star.
