There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, specifically an Air Intelligence Information Report dated September 27, 1952. The text of the report is as follows:

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FEATURE: 
PLACE: Hearne, Texas
DATE: 27 September 1952
TIME: 2107 hours
COUNTRY: United States
REPORT NO.: 
EVALUATOR: Intelligence Officer
SUMMARY: On 29 September 1952 information was received concerning a "flying saucer" sighting reported to the Bryan Air Force Base Control Tower by a Dr. ... and others. The informant, who is reportedly a member of a party of seven, allegedly had seen an object flying over Hearne, Texas, at 2107 hours. Few definite facts were given, and the phone connection was poor, causing the report to be rather sketchy. The accuracy of the information and reliability of the observers cannot be determined.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
IR-71-52 (ATIC) PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES
A/2C Joseph A. Kupeck, AF 17232299, Control Tower Operator, received the following information by telephone in the Ryan Air Force Base Control Tower at 2300 hours on 29 September 1952.
Persons giving the information stated that they observed and Dr. called in to the Control Tower and said they observed one large flying saucer over Hearne, Texas, at 2107 hours, 29 September 1952. The object made a large semi-circular sweep from south to north and made its exit to the southwest at a terrific rate of speed. The object was described as orange-yellow and black in color. Several of the men in the alleged crew of seve stated the celestial appearances as being in sight on many occasions. All men in the specially visible; the saucer had no wings. Altitude was estimated around 20,000 feet.
Upon analyzing it was determined that neither Mr. lived in the surrounding directory of Hearne, Texas, or of Bryan, Texas, or anywhere in the neighboring areas; therefore, further questioning was not possible. The credibility of the observers can not be established.
