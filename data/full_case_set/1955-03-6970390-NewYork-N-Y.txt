OIN: 55-7-6
TO: DIR INTEL, USAF
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT, 23 FEBRUARY 1955, NEW YORK, N.Y.
1. EVALUATION: THERE IS INSUFFICIENT PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THIS OBJECT. THE ONLY INFORMATION AVAILABLE IS THE SUBJECTIVE ACCOUNT OF ONE WITNESS.
2. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: NO PHOTOGRAPHS OR OTHER PHYSICAL EVIDENCE ARE AVAILABLE FOR EXAMINATION. THE WITNESS, ROBERT C. WILSON, IS AN ENGINEER WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE OBSERVED A DISC-SHAPED OBJECT ABOUT 35-40 FEET IN DIAMETER HOVERING OVER NEW YORK CITY FOR APPROXIMATELY 2-3 MINUTES ON 23 FEBRUARY 1955. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS METALLIC IN APPEARANCE, ROTATING SLOWLY, AND EMITTING A SLIGHT HISSING SOUND. IT THEN ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.
3. INVESTIGATION AND COMMENTS: INASMUCH AS NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE IS AVAILABLE FOR SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS, THIS INCIDENT MUST BE CLASSED AS AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT BASED SOLELY ON THE SUBJECTIVE REPORT OF ONE WITNESS. NO FURTHER INVESTIGATIVE ACTION IS CONTEMPLATED.

I have transcribed all the text that appears in the image. There are no other relevant details or content beyond what is shown in the textual information provided.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a table or chart labeled "EXPLANATION" that provides detailed information about the U.S. standard atmosphere, including details about pressure, density, and temperature at various altitudes.

EXPLANATION
The graph and annotations explain the relationship between pressure, altitude, and other atmospheric conditions in the U.S. standard atmosphere as it is defined. The text provides a detailed technical description of this relationship, including the specific values for pressure, density, and temperature at different altitudes.

DATE/TIME GROUP: 3 MARCH 1955/2000Z
EVALUATION: LT COL J-3 LCDR

CONTACTS: SPECIAL AGENT/S, DEPT OF STATE, NEW YORK, N.Y.

INCIDENT: ON 3 MARCH 1955 AT 2000Z, WITNESSES REPORTED SEEING A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY OVER NEW YORK, N.Y. THE LIGHT APPEARED STATIONARY AT FIRST THEN BEGAN MOVING AT HIGH SPEED IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND DISAPPEARED. SEVERAL WITNESSES INDEPENDENTLY REPORTED THIS SIGHTING BUT WERE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE OBJECT.

EVALUATION: THIS REPORT DOES NOT CONTAIN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY THE NATURE OF THE OBJECT SIGHTED. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE IF THE SIGHTING COULD BE EXPLAINED AS A KNOWN OBJECT OR PHENOMENON.

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: NEW YORK, N.Y.
DATE/TIME GROUP: 26 MARCH 1955, 2030Z
REPORT BY: LT. RICHARD L. GROMER, 73RD ACRON, MITCHEL AFB, N.Y.
NARRATIVE: 
AT APPROXIMATELY 2030Z ON 26 MARCH 1955, LT. RICHARD L. GROMER WAS DRIVING HOME FROM MITCHEL AFB, N.Y. WHEN HE OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE SOUTHEASTERN SKY APPROXIMATELY 30 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MOVING IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. LT. GROMER STOPPED HIS CAR AND OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 SECONDS. HE DESCRIBED THE OBJECT AS A BRIGHT YELLOWISH-WHITE LIGHT, LARGER THAN A STAR AND WITHOUT APPRECIABLE CHANGE IN BRIGHTNESS DURING THE OBSERVATION.
AFTER 20 SECONDS, THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW, APPARENTLY MOVING OUT OF SIGHT RATHER THAN BLINKING OUT. LT. GROMER CONTINUED HIS DRIVE HOME AND REPORTED HIS OBSERVATION TO THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICE AT MITCHEL AFB UPON ARRIVAL.
WEATHER: CLEAR SKIES, VISIBILITY 15 MILES.
EVALUATOR'S COMMENTS:
THIS REPORT IS CONSIDERED CREDIBLE, AS THE OBSERVER IS A TRAINED OBSERVER OF AIRCRAFT AND ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA. THE OBJECT DISPLAYED CHARACTERISTICS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE REPORTED FOR UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, SUCH AS HIGH SPEED AND DISAPPEARANCE FROM VIEW WITHOUT DIMINISHING IN BRIGHTNESS. THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE FAVORABLE FOR VISUAL OBSERVATION. THEREFORE, THIS REPORT IS EVALUATED AS AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
