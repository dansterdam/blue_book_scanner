10. CONCLUSION OTHER ROCKET LAUNCH
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS Approximately 20 flight line personnel sighted a white light that seemed to be emitting blue-green waves. These waves got brighter and the waves progresser outward in a spiral. The light was observed at approximately 2 to 3 degrees above the horizon for approximately 1 to 1.5 minutes. The light remained in relatively the same position and after about three minutes suddenly blinked out. COMMENTS: The sighting was almost undoubtedly caused by a rocket launch from Cape Kennedy.

1. Reference your letter of 30 August 1968, subject as above.

2. There was a launch from Cape Kennedy at the time the aerial phenomena was observed. It was the first Poseidon launch, and appeared very much as it was sighted from Craig AFB. At the altitude at which the phenomena occurred the Project Office advises that a 600 M horizon is reasonable. The time of the sighting would have had to be several minutes before the time you established the sighting, however.

UFO OBSERVATION, 15 August 1968
PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE (AFSC)
CAPE KENNEDY AFS

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report that occurred at Craig AFB, Alabama on 15 August 1968 at 0538 GMT, 10332.

2. Approximately 20 flight line personnel sighted a white light near runway 14. The light remained in a stationary position for several minutes, then moved rapidly up and down the runway, then climbed at a 45 degree angle and disappeared from view. The light was observed at approximately 2 to 3 degrees above the horizon and remained in view for approximately 2 to 3 minutes.

3. We understand that you had a rocket launch at 10:30Z. We would like to know if your activity did launch a rocket launch at this time. If it could appear similar to the description given by the observers, and if you feel that it could have been observed from Craig AFB (420 nautical miles away).

4. Thank you for your assistance; it is appreciated.

AT 2332 LOCAL (1930 GMT) ROCKET LAUNCH AT CAPE KENNEDY COUND EXPLAIN THE LIGHT. THE BEARING TO CAPE KENNEDY (120 DEG), THE TYPE OF LIGHT EMISSIONS, AND THE APPEARANCE OF NO MOVEMENT CAN BE LOGICALLY EXPLAINED BY THE ROCKET. THE ONLY UNACOUNTED FACT IS THE DISTANCE TO CAPE KENNEDY (422 NAUTICAL MILES). IT IS MY CONCLUSION THAT THE PAGE 3 RUCLRLAI215 UNCLAS LIGHT PHENONEMON WAS IN FACT THE ROCKET LAUNCH AT CAPE KENNEDY.
