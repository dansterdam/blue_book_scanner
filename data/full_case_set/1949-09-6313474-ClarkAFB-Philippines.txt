11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers did not see the object that made thecontrails. One 
observer stated that he saw a small black dot at the head of
the contrail. Object traveled straight except for a slight
change of course.

Two F-51's left the base at approximately 1135 hours on a head-
ing of 360 degrees making good a course of 350 degrees for appro-
ximately 120 miles. At this time they were given a heading 
back to the base. It was the opinion of the investigating officer
that these aircraft made th&sk contrail and that it was delqyd
in_foming.

TC-365-49 22

STATEMENT

At about 1200 hours on 3 September 1949, while leading a three (3) ship flight approximately ten (10) miles southeast of Clark AFB, at 6,000 feet heading south during a turn to the left, understayned officers to left wing man, (Lt. R. J. Serrani) called, "Look up to the right." Looking up to the right, I saw an object climbing towards the north at a high rate of speed leaving a con-trail. It was climbing at a steep angle (approximately 30°). Once sighted I would estimate it to be at about 15,000 feet, thirty (30) miles from our position and climbing rapidly. I reversed thin turn to the right and pressed out the wing men while in the turn, till the wing man in leading about a 35° bank. Upon reaching a heading of north, which took not over a minute and a half (closer to a minute) since it was a steep bank, the object had reached an altitude estimated to be 50,000 feet. It was dark in color and far enough away so that nothing more was distinguishable than a black dot. At about 50,000 feet it made a sharp "level-out not at all like an airplane leveling off after the climb-starting a definite climb" with its con-trail. My first impression was to start after it but obviously its speed was so great it was impossible. The con-trail was one long thin line and had not dissipated to any extent at all from its beginning at the south to its present position, almost out of sight heading north. Upon plotting its relative position from us, and the 'quick lengthening' of our separation, it is estimated to have been traveling well over 800 miles per hour.

STATEMENT

At 1202 hours on 3 September 1949, undersigned officer was at approximately 6,000 feet in a flight of three F-51's. While in a turn Major Sebille, Flight Leader, motioned for me to look to the right. We were heading approximately south when undersigned officer saw a con-trail at about 15,000 feet. When looking back at Major Sebille he had reversed his turn so undersigned officer followed, We rolled out of the turn flying parallel to the con-trail. Undersigned could see that it was at about a 30° angle of climb. Undersigned officer checked his compass heading at 350°.

From the time undersigned officer first saw the con-trail to the time we completed the turn it had moved from a position south of us to a position far north of us. Object traveled straight except for a slight change of course. Immediately following the change of direction a slight rolling-in of the con-trail occurred. It was like the wake from a ship, but instead of rolling-out this was curling-in. Undersigned officer could see where the track continued in the climb to between 35,000 and 40,000 feet where it leveled off and continued on the straight course.

At no time did undersigned officer see what was making the con-trail. Undersigned officer saw its point of origin the first time he looked but did not see an aircraft, When he was in a position to see again the con-trail had already been made.

I continued on course parallel to object for a while and then returned to Clark due to lack of sufficient fuel to continue. His engine was at 1200 and his could still see the tail. Then undersigned lost the contrail.

STATEMENT

At about 1200 hours on 8 September 1949, undersigned officer was flying as left wing man for Major Sabillo. While in a turn to the left, at an altitude of 6,000 feet, he saw a black spot giving a smoke trail which appeared at first to be a skywriter. After watching the rate of climb of this object, at a high rate of speed on a constant course, he realized it was not a skywriter. Approximately ten to fifteen seconds later, he called the object to the attention of his Flight Leader, Major Sabillo. Major Sabillo, Major Schildt then started a turn to the right, at least a standard rate turn or better, which took us approximately one to one and one half minutes to complete 130 to 225° of turn which put us on a course to parallel that of the object. When the turn was started undersigned officer estimated the distance of the object to have been at least five miles to the South and approximately twenty (20) miles away at an altitude of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. Upon completion of that turn the object appeared to be approximately 30,000 to 35,000 feet, still climbing and ahead of the flight about twenty (20) miles on a course of about 340°. The Flight paralleled the course of the con-trail and the object continued to climb and move was now between 40,000 and 50,000 feet, north of us. There was a definite break or "bleb" in the con-trail when the object leveled off. The con-trail could be seen from the top of the cloud level, estimated to be 10,000 feet to the objects level of altitude. The trail was distinct and held, so that it was still visible from the ground after we had landed at 1220 hours.

STATEMENT

At about 1200 hours 8 September 1949, undersigned officer was returning from an aerial gunnery tow mission and at approximately 20 miles north of Clark Air Force Base, at the altitude of 4500 feet, while on a southerly heading, undersigned officer noticed a very dense con-trail in the vicinity of Subic Bay. The con-trail was extending north at a high rate of climb and speed. Undersigned officer could not clearly discern the object making this con-trail. From the time undersigned officer first saw this object until it disappeared up near the vicinity of Lingayen Gulf a matter of only two or three minutes had elapsed. At first sight this object appeared to be at an altitude of about 15,000 feet and about 20 to 25 miles southwest of Clark. This object was at an estimated 50,000 feet by the time undersigned officer lost sight of it. The object appeared to be in level flight just before it disappeared from view.

STATEMENT

At about 1200 hours, 8 September 1949, undersigned officer was at the PX Service
Station at Clark Air Force Base, and spotted a vapor trail south of the field,
coming from the direction of Florida Blanca. Approximately one and one half minutes
later the trail was far to the north. During the minute and a half that he watched
this vapor trail it did not appear to get wider from where he first saw it to where
he lost sight of it. This trail came from the direction of Florida Blanca going north
and passed over the west side of Clark Air Force Base, where it seemed to make a
slight change of course to the left, approximately 10°, and continued on in a
northerly direction. Undersigned officer could not tell whether or not the vapor
trail was changing altitude. It is hard to estimate the height of the vapor trail
but it seemed to be above 30,000 feet. He could not see what caused the vapor trail.
Where he saw the vapor trail make a slight change of course, the trail appeared to
burbia for about ten seconds and remain in a burble state. Then the vapor trail
resumed its straight unbroken form.

Undersigned officer had been flying from 0800 to 1145 hours, 8 September 1949,
at altitudes between 20,000 and 30,000 feet and watched GCI (Ground Control Intercept)
ships flying at altitudes of 25,000 to 30,500 feet, and they were leaving no vapor
trails and he was leaving no vapor trail.

STATEMENT

On the 8th of September 1949, while on duty as Fighter Interception Controller,
had a flight of two F-51's at 30,000 feet. They left the base at approximately 1135
hours on a heading of 360° making good a course of 350° for approximately 120 miles.
At this time they were given a holding back to base.

It is my opinion that the contrails that were sighted twenty-five minutes later
were made by this flight and were delayed in forming.

From my observation I could not see any other aircraft in the air at that
altitude during this time.

STATEMENT

Undersigned officer, with Lt. Dall as Wing Man, took off from Clark Air Force
Base at 1010 hours, 8 September 1949 to fly Calibration Mission for 622nd AC & W
Squadron. After we had climbed to 25,000 feet over the field, Varnish Control gave
a Vector of 360° and continued climbing until we reached 30,000 feet. We continued on
to heading and at a point east of Lingayen was given a 5° correction to the right.
We followed this course about 120 miles north of the field. At this point Varnish
gave us a heading of 170°, which we followed, and we began to let down at approximately
by 15° 20 minutes North and 120° 55 minutes East. We landed at 1210 hours. While
we were flying at 30,000 feet we did not see any vapor trails, but noticed scattered
thunder showers circling the entire valley.

Philippine Republic
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Supplementary Report of: Unidentified Aircraft or Flying Object.
Southwest, west and Northwest of Clark AFB Asst'l C/S, A-2, FEAF, APO 925
4 October 1949
8 September 1949
3-2

Captain S. F. Hepford
Observers, USAF Officers

SUMMARY: (Limit space report to summary of report; use tape reports of two attached sheets for pamphlets. Use no technical terms or technical terms defined in text.)

1. At approximately 0800 hours ZEBRA, 8 September 1949, five officers of the 67th Fighter Squadron, 18th Fighter Group, observed a con-trail climbing at a 30 degree angle and at a high rate of speed in a Northerly direction. The object causing this con-trail was not identified. Several of the observers saw only the con-trail and did not see what had caused said con-trail.

2. Radar Warning at the time of sighting was in operation and was in the process of calibration, using two P-51 type aircraft for this purpose. The Fighter Interceptor Controller on duty did not identify any other aircraft in the air at that time and is of the opinion that the con-trail was formed by said two P-51 aircraft. This is discounted as thirty minutes time elapsed between the time of sighting and the time these two aircraft left Clark Air Force Base at an altitude of 30,000 feet, heading 360 degrees, and also only one con-trail was observed.

3. This section is unable to discern what object or phenomena caused the above mentioned con-trail.

The rest of the document below the transmittal header is extremely faded and blurry, making it impossible to read the remaining content accurately. The document appears to be a standard form used for transmitting information, likely within a military or government agency context. The references to "CLASSIFICATION" and "ENCLOSURES" suggest it relates to the handling of classified documents or information. The form number and replacement note imply it is from a specific set of documentation protocols (ATSC FORM NO. 70-105B replacing FORM NO. 10-354). Given the poor quality of the image, it's not feasible to provide more details.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Ass't C/S, A-2, FAF, APO 925                                   TR-365-49                            

8. Appearance of object: Major Louis J. Sabille, 6653A, Commanding Officer, 67th
Fighter Squadron described it as being dark in color and far enough away so that
nothing more was distinguishable than a black dot. 1st Lt. R. J. Serra, AO-922143,
67th Fighter Squadron states he saw a black spot giving off what appeared to be a
smoke trail and then saw that it was a con-trail. The other observers did not
discern any color or description of a object but did see the con-trail.

9. Direction of Flight: Heading of approximately 350 - 360 degrees from Bataan
Peninsula (14°45'N - 120°25'E) to the area South of Lingayen Gulf (150°50' -
120°10'E).

10. Tactics or maneuvers: Object climbed at a 30 degree angle up to 25,000 - 30,000
fast at which point it made a slight change of course to the left and continued on the
30 degree climb up to 40,000 - 50,000 feet where it abruptly leveled off and continued
on the same heading with no change in altitude.

11. Evidence of exhaust:

     a. Color of smoke; no smoke was observed. Lt. Serra at first thought the trail
       was very similar to trail left by a skywriter but as the trail climbed he saw it to be
       a con-trail.

     b. Length: Approximately eight miles.

     c. Width: Could not estimate the width.  It appeared to be thin, yet definite,
        and traveled in a straight unbroken form with one exception, when it made a slight
        course correction.  Refer to statements of Lt. Cree and Lt. Moore.

     d. Odor: Unknown.

     e. Rate of evaporation: Thirty minutes after the first sighting the con-trail
       was still discoverable.

     e. Does trail vary with sound? Unknown.

12. Effect on clouds. No effects observed.

13. Lights: No lights observed.

14. Support: Unknown.

15. Propulsion: Unknown.

16. Control and stability: Unknown.

17. Air ducts: Unknown.

18. Speed-MPH: Estimated as well over 1,000 MPH.
