DEARBORN OBSERVATORY
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS

DEAR DR. HYNEK:

I HAVE BEEN MEANING TO WRITE YOU FOR QUITE SOME TIME SO THAT I COULD SEND YOU SOME PROGRESS REPORTS ON OUR "UNION" PROJECT. IF YOU RECALL, MY FAMILY HAD AN ENJOYABLE VACATION NORTH OF THE BORDER, AND SOON AFTER OUR RETURN WE EQUIPED OUR UNION WITH EQUIPMONT HAS BEEN OPERATING 16-INCH REFLECTOR FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS. THE TELESCOPE NEEDS SOME MINOR ATTENTION, AND WE SHOULD HAVE IT BACK IN OPERATION SHORTLY.

AT THE PRESENT, WE ARE USING A MODIFICATION (8-16C) PHOTO ADAPTER WHICH WAS DEVELOPED FOR US BY THE CANADIAN ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC PURPOSES. IN THIS CONNECTION, WE HAVE ALSO BEEN WORKING ON THE 1132 LUNAR CALIBER.

IF THE FIELD TRIALS ARE SUCCESSFUL, WE HOPE TO FIELD-TEST THE SYSTEM SHORTLY. OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT HAVE NOT BEEN AS SUCCESSFUL AS WE HAD HOPED, BUT WE STILL ARE CONTINUING OUR EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION.

AT THE PRESENT TIME, DISCUSSIONS ARE BEING HELD AT GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER AND THE BECAM INTERESTED IN THE QUALITY OF THE TRACKING SYSTEM. THEY BECAME INTERESTED IN THE QUALITY OF THE TRACKING SYSTEM. TAKING WITH THE PROJECT DIRECTOR AND THE BECAM INTERESTED IN THE QUALITY OF THE TRACKING SYSTEM. THE BECAM'S CURRENT THINKING IS THAT THEIR SERVICE AT GODDARD WILL BE REQUIRED FOR SOME OF THEIR OBSERVATIONS OF PHENOMENA.

WE ARE WITH YOUR TIME DISCUSSING THE U.F.O. PROBLEM WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA AND, WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT FACTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RECORDED. IN THIS CONNECTION, I SHALL BE IN TOUCH WITH YOU AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

SINCERELY,
(SIGNATURE)

Dr. J. A. Hynek

Page 2

Wife of a Naval aviator (Cdr. _ _ _ _ _ _ , USN) and three daughters were driving from the Air Force Academy to Florida when they were forced to make an emergency landing due to trouble with their car. They proceeded to drive carefully and slowly to a service station but discovered that the battery was dead and the car would not start. They were all in transit to different destinations. I do not know the names of the officers who assisted them.

Mrs. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Air Force Academy, Colorado

Lt. Cdr. A. H. Rice, USN, recently came in to offer our services. If you could interest yourself and would like to offer our services, it would certainly be appreciated. We would be most happy to be of help in the Conet, we could work on this case.

Finally, I would like to invite you to visit us and the Naval Academy in this area.

Sincerely,
J. Allen Hynek

U. S. Air Force Academy
Colorado

Dear Mrs. XXXXX:

This is in answer to your letter of December 9. Thank you for your cooperative efforts.

Some action has been taken with the sighting which Mrs. XXXXX states was investigated through official channels. It appears that this could be considered an official or unofficial "unknown" but I am unable to give you any further details as to the real nature of the sighting through official channels.

I appreciate your opinion on this, and, of course, if you have any further information that would be helpful, I would be glad to receive it.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director

UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ACADEMY, COLORADO
December 9, 1964

Dear Dr. Hynek:

As you are well aware, it would be most desirable to furnish you with any information relative to our sightings by USAF pilots or "DXGers" who do not report at the various bases. 

The time was about midnight June 5, 1964 about 10 miles S. of this base. An airman reported seeing an extremely bright light, comparable to a moon in brightness, coming from the direction of Colorado Springs and traveling in a northeasterly direction. He described its motion as a smooth, majestic, extremely fast motion, like nothing he had ever seen before. The object was visible for about 4-5 minutes.

At one point, the object appeared to move abruptly, hesitatingly, as if checking its course. The airman watched it until it disappeared from view, far off in the distance. The air traffic control tower and the operations office were notified, and the incident was reported to the Project Blue Book office at the Air Force Academy.

Any additional information you can supply regarding this sighting would be most appreciated. Likewise, any comments you may have concerning the handling of these matters would be very helpful.

Sincerely yours,

Whenever your findings are published in book form, it must be remembered that, due to security reasons, certain details cannot be divulged. The same applies to those who will be studying the observations along with you. While the text that could be read seems to be encouraging observers to come forward, it appears that some information has been intentionally removed or hidden from view.
