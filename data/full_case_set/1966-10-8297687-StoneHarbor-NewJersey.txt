Gentlemen:
I am writing you a letter to you that my friend and I saw a UFO. We have been hesitating to write to you for fear we will be ridiculed because I am ridiculed all day by my classmates. They think I am crazy believing in UFOs. I have read four flying saucer paperbacks. They are as follows: Anderson's Observation, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, Flying Saucers, and The Starting Evidence of the Invasion from Outer Space, and Flying Saucers Serious 13.

I think that The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects was the most interesting. I believe the UFO almost certainly exist. I hope they will find the answer in this decade, and I hope the answer is that there are space crafts from other world beside ours.

Gentlemen:

I am very sorry that I haven't sent you this form sooner, but I couldn't find it after I filled it out. Would you please send me the results. I would like to know what opinion on what you think it is. I surely don't know.

Do you have any information on UFOs that I might have? Also would you be so kind as to send me some information on becoming a member of your great organization, Project Blue Book. I have read many magazines, pamphlets, and books on UFOs. I have my own classification on these things. Some are hoaxes, some is mistaken identity, and some as yet unexplained. I have studied them for 10 years and I thought I would not be one myself.
