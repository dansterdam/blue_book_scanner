There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing a series of questions and text.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the match head? If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The image contains multiple sketches or drawings. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above it, and the second sketch shows a larger landscape scene with a silhouetted figure in the foreground. The third sketch shows a smaller, more distant landscape.

OCR text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (outline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show the same object's higher position as it moved.

DEAR SIR:
AT APPROXIMATELY SEVEN P.M. ON THURSDAY NIGHT, JULY 16, WHILE LYING ON MY BACK AS DIRECTED BY SEARCH AND RESCUE AGENCY PERSONNEL, I OBSERVED A LUMINOUS OBJECT MOVING IN THE SKY. ALMOST A LITTLE HAZY AND SLIGHTLY SOUTH (ABOUT 30 DEGREES BOTH WAYS) THERE APPEARED A BRIGHTER SPHERICAL FORM A SIMILAR TO SOMEWHAT SMALLER IN SIZE TO THE TAIL OF A COMET IN ORBIT AND MOVING AT ABOUT THE SAME SPEED. THE LIGHT WAS WARM AND THE SKY WAS FAIRLY HAZY, BUT THERE WERE NO VISIBLE CLOUDS, AND THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME MOTION. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE MUCH LOWER THAN THE STARS, ALTHOUGH ONLY SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN THE BRIGHTER ONES AND MORE LUMINOUS THAN ANY. ITS ORBIT OR COURSE SEEMED LOWER THAN THAT OF THE SATELLITE, AS THOUGH APPROACHING. STILL BELIEVING IT WAS A SATELLITE.
I MENTIONED THIS TO A FRIEND NEARBY WHO GRADUALLY IT BEGAN TO CHANGE ORBIT AND APPARENT SPEED. THE ORBIT BECAME MORE ERRATIC AS WE WATCHED AND SLOWER TO THE POINT OF STOPPING. ALSO, THE INTENSITY OF THE OBJECTS LIGHT WAS A BRIGHT YELLOW--WHITE AT FIRST, CHANGED TO A DIMMER, MORE BLUISH GLOW AND DIMINISHING IN SIZE. THE CHILDREN OBSERVED IT, AND THEY TOO WATCHED ITS DIRECTION CHANGES; IT DID NOT REVERSE BUT WENT FROM LEFT TO RIGHT WHILE IT CONTINUED ITS ERRATIC COURSE. THE INITIAL FAST-HORIZONTAL WAS DIRECTION TO ALMOST DUE NORTH AND THEN SLOWLY MOVED EAST. ALL OF THIS SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document states:

"About 1:30 AM on April 19, 1964 an object was observed in the sky at Chicago, Illinois. The object was globular in shape and appeared to be emitting light. The light was bright and seemed to fluctuate in intensity. The object was observed for over an hour and perhaps longer, as the observer had to leave the observation site. The object seemed to be stationary, and there is no indication that it moved during the observation period. The observer is a reliable person who is interested in astronomy and flying objects in general. He states he cannot explain what he observed, and believes it was not the same type of object as the usual aircraft or satellite."
