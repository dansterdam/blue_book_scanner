Description: Circular, metallic, large, grayish formation, bright. Flew towards NW, then reversed course to SE, when was at about 70 deg, elev remained same during observation.
Direction of Motion: Southeast
Satellite: (AFCIN-4F3. Phone 69219) Filled out

Analyst's and Conclusions: The reported object is stated to be a grayish metallic circular formation, which flew under observation for a brief period, first moving toward the NW then reversing its course to the SE and maintaining the same elevation during observation. No astronomical, radar, or natural phenomena are noted, and conventional aircraft are ruled out. The witness appears to be probably reliable. The object apparently represented some type of airborne phenomenon, the exact nature of which is not precisely identified, other than that it does not fit any known conventional categories.
