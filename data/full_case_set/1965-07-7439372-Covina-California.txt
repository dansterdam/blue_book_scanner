The image contains a sketch diagram and a compass rose. The sketch diagram shows the path of an object or objects in the sky, with instructions on how to mark the location of the object relative to the horizon and compass directions. The compass rose appears to be used for reference in determining the direction of the object's movement.

OCR TEXT OUTPUT:
27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "B" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a figure that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I have seen many odd objects in the sky, but this was the second one that I could not identify. It was a solid object of some kind, moving across the sky very rapidly, and making no sound that I could hear. The first time I saw an object like this, it was of the same general shape, but much larger. This one seemed to be about the same size as a normal jet aircraft. It was moving very rapidly, and as I watched, it seemed to disappear very quickly, almost as if it had gone into a cloud. This was in the daytime, and there were no clouds in the sky at the time. I just cannot explain what it was.

14 September 1965

Dear 
The description of the objects which you observed on the night of 25 July 1965 was submitted to meteorologists. The duration of twenty minutes is not consistent with our evaluation. The duration indicated would show no details. The direction of the objects' speed and altitude precluded detailed indicators a possible satellite observation, but the description of the object is not in accord with this evaluation. The most significant disparity is in view of the conflicting data presented, the impossibility of a precise identification of the objects. However, a duration of 20 minutes is too long for an aircraft to be observed. The time has been estimated the conflicting data, in view of the description, duration, speed and elevation or altitude of the objects.

The attached brochure gives the results of our Project Blue Book, an unclassified project.

The Air Force does not engage in any activities such as you have indicated in your letter of 25 September 1955. Nor do we request the FBI or local officials to do so.

The Air Force regards all witnesses as reliable and sincere and does not question the integrity of those reporting sightings. Your report was forwarded to us from Los Angeles and the additional form was which you because no evaluation could be made on the original. I have reviewed the information you provided and your report has received the evaluation given in our previous correspondence. No further investigation into this matter will be made.

Sincerely,

I wonder this might would appear strange just at first glance I felt, that someone is calling out to me around 9:00.

When can I make an account of this incident. Yesterday afternoon three youngsters riding bicycles saw a large metallike object hovering at treetop level but a few blocks away. It seemed to go faster at the sight of them. This long place I forgot, it lasted a moie than a minute or so.

I must admit that a cold chills went up on me and I gripped it Didn't know what to think at first but then I decided call the O.R.Y.U. (local unit?). I missed them by may be 5-10 mins, they had checked and left according info from neighbors or so.

Respectfully, I remain, (Signature)

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The text in the document is as follows:

I think maybe he died. 
Then I kept on walking until I was three blocks away, and I saw a small street come up on the original street before.
But after I walked away from the neighborhood across the street, the motorcycle made its disappearance and I could not find the street. 
Please May it Sig.
Sincerely one man's report stating it is exactly 13-foot, it stands is westerly the opposite side of chuate ware a mee and I don't tell to the tilt with you color, I'm any grass seen, douse drying of you and light it in any crowd.
