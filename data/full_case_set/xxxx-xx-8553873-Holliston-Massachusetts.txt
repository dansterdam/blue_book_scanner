35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
At the center of the object was a reddish color light which appeared to be pulsing at a constant rate. The outer edge of the object emitted a white light which also appeared to be pulsing. The object was round and about 40 feet in diameter. It hovered over a field for 3 or 4 minutes then shot up very rapidly to an altitude of approximately 2000 ft and disappeared. The craft remained a couple of feet above the ground and did not make any sound. No vapor trail was visible. I was standing on a porch about 200 yards from the object when I first saw it. The night was clear and there was no moon. I have no explanation for what I saw. There was no reflection from the object on the ground nor was there any distortion of the background. The object was totally silent but its appearance was very real and dramatic. I am quite certain that what I observed was not any type of conventional aircraft. The sighting lasted only a few minutes but the visual image has remained very vivid in my memory.
