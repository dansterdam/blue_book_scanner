Dear Mr. 
This is in reply to your request for information on your aerial observation of 4 September 1965.
The description, duration, and direction of flight are characteristic of satellite. On 4 September Echo II was traveling in an east to west direction at an average altitude of 700 miles. It would have been visible to the naked eye.
Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear sir,

On the 22d part of August last year. I saw about 8:30 p.m. two objects in the sky which I could not identify. They appeared round and metallic in color and moved across the sky in a north to south direction. The first object crossed the sky in approximately 30 seconds and the second object followed approximately 1 minute later. They moved at a steady rate of speed and did not appear to be aircraft. I did not hear any sound from the objects.

I hope this information is of some use to you.
