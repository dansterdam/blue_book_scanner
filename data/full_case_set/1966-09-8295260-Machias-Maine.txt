This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page with instructions and diagrams for a witness to provide information about their UFO sighting.

The text on the page reads:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Based on the text extraction from the document, the output is as follows:

"We continue the D. F. Case Case #0276 report for the day and hour as stated: The object was first observed at 6:15 PM EDT on Sept 16, 1966 when it was spotted in the sky over Machias, Maine. It was observed for approximately 15 minutes and was described as a bright, round object, larger than a conventional aircraft, which appeared to hover and then move silently in a horizontal direction at a rapid rate of speed. No sound was heard. The object was observed by several persons independently and was reported to the Machias police department. The object disappeared from view after approximately 15 minutes of observation. No further details are available at this time."
