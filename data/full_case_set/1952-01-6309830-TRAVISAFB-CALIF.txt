AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO.: 5
FROM: Lt. Col. - 5th St. San Mateo, Calif.
TO: CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED 
PAGES: 2 of 2 PAGES

The following report is submitted as the result of an interview with Pfc. with the Air Operations and Electronics Section, 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, Travis Air Force Base, California on 5 January 1952:

On 6 January 1952 between the hours of 0300 and 0530 the informant sighted what appeared to be an unidentified flying object. The weather during the time of observation was clear, the moon visible, however a high, broken, overcast was observed over the area. The object was alone at the time and moving in a steady, uniform motion approximately 10,000 feet in altitude. The object hovered on a relatively bearing approximately 60 to 75 degrees to the north (300) feet. The unidentified sighting appeared to be going forward and moving up and down slightly in a vertical motion. No jet type aircraft taking off or landing were observed at the time. The object appeared to be about the size of a quarter when held at arm's length. The object shone a bright, brilliant light and after reaching a point about 20 degrees above the horizon, it dimmed gradually until it disappeared from sight.

Reference: I. Your letter 22 May 1968, subject: UFO Investigations,
I have the following comments on all the cases you have
listed, in the order they were listed.

1. 7 January 1952, Palmer, Alaska.
      I have noted this case 23 C/, meaning that as far as witness
ness was concerned, the stimulus giving rise to this report could
have been something quite ordinary or it could have fallen into the
category of "cigar-shaped UFO" reported from many countries and
which have no probably explanation. In this instance, there is not
sufficient information to go on. The report we have is stated:
"Alaska Air Command informed and will take further investigative
action, if any further data warranted when available."

      To the best of my knowledge the further data were never transmitted.
Data plus time that it was reported by one woman out of 2 (not 45 as the original report stated) and the fact that it was observed at the time of the setting sun, leading me to think that it possibly could have been an unusual meteorological, but data insufficient for firm evaluation" is my recommendation for this classification.

2.  14 April 1952, LaCrosse, Wisconsin.
      I originally asked to review this case in the hopes that unknown to me some additional follow-up had been made. I found that
despite the fact that a captain of commercial airliner and others
reported this incident, the file on this case contained very little
additional information.
