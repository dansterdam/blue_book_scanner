Reference your May 1967 observation of an unidentified flying object. Reply to your request for clarification on your sighting:

The sighting occurred on the night of 14 May 1967, however, the conditions you considered indicated this was not a conventional aircraft. Based on the information you provided, the lighting conditions and the maneuvering you observed would approximate a note from you clarifying this discrepancy.

UFO Observation, 17 May 1957

Washington, D. C. 20034

I refer to your phone call I had made that I was mailing this to you and it is in this that the item to you was that I told you of the report.

I think it would be best if you contact the information this was given to me. I feel with all certainty as an officer who has been constantly connected and discussed by an intermediary. The questions are often proficient and I will be very interested in your comments.

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, but there is no photograph present in this particular page. The text on the page appears to be a handwritten narrative describing a UFO sighting.

The text from the document is as follows:

"34.  Date you completed this questionnaire: 3 May   1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The object was stationary at first, then started moving at a high rate of speed. It was luminous in color and giving off light. It traveled in a straight line and then stopped abruptly. It remained stationary for a while then moved again at a high rate of speed. This was repeated several times. It appeared to be approximately 50-75 feet across and was definitely not an aircraft, satellite or any normal aerial object. The sighting took place in front of witnesses and I actually saw it along with my wife. The object seemed to be at a very high altitude, possibly 10,000-20,000 feet. It did not make any sound and left no trail. The sighting lasted approximately 15-20 minutes. I have not seen anything like it before. It appeared to be under intelligent control. I would not consider myself to be an "expert" but this is exactly what I saw and I am sure of it."

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

THINK RAITS

Keep Explanation
Some people have a ready explanation for unidentified flying objects. They say they are "weather balloons," "satellites," "airplanes," etc. The trouble is, many of these objects don't fit any of these explanations. Let's be honest - there are some things in the skies that don't have a simple, ready explanation.

Careful Observers
Can private pilot - Aug 15, 1957, Newmanstown, Pa. (see Acrobatics report).

A look to be professional aerial observers, trained in identification of aircraft and natural phenomena, can often determine that what they are seeing is not readily identifiable. Their reports sometimes include details that indicate a startling performance beyond the capabilities of known aircraft.

Matching Reports
Investigators frequently document stories of sightings seen 100-200 years ago which seem to match recent UFO reports (see Matching Reports).

Respected Scientists
Many respected scientists have seriously studied unidentified flying objects. Some of these include J. Allen Hynek of Ohio State University, Dr. James E. McDonald of the University of Arizona, Dr. John S. Derr of the U.S. Geological Survey and Dr. James A. Harder of the University of California. These men advise A. E. Cope, Office of Naval Research, that there is a real phenomenon worthy of serious scientific study.

Application Symposium
Washington, D.C. will be the site of a symposium on UFOs on October 26-27, 1967. The symposium is for use of state Govt. authorities who wish to learn more about UFOs, their characteristics, investigation techniques, etc. It is being presented by NICAP's Advisory Group on Unconventional Aerospace Phenomena and Goddard Space Flight Center. Interested authorities should contact Dr. Thornton Page, Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.

The image contains a diagram and a description of "Laser Range Finders for Tanks Developed by TRG, Inc." The diagram appears to show various components and details related to the laser range finders. Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract the text from the document.

Laser Range Finders for Tanks Developed by TRG, Inc.
Laser range finders, developed by TRG, Inc., for the U.S. Army, for tanks and other military vehicles.
The laser finders for the United Kingdom-produced "Chieftain" tanks, the Canadian "Centurion" tanks, and the U.S. "Patton" tanks are described in the report.
The finders (1) provide target range and acquisition, (2) gunner's control and display, and (3) main gun computer interface.
The range finder is located in the turret of the tank and provides target range data to the fire control computer through the tank's data bus.
The range data is displayed on a gunner's control and display unit. This unit also provides controls for selecting the target and initiating the range finding operation.
The laser range finder uses a pulsed 1.06 micron neodymium laser to measure the range to the target. The laser beam is scanned in the horizontal and vertical planes to locate and track the target.
The range data is accurate to within 10 meters at target ranges up to 9,800 meters.
The laser range finder and associated electronics are enclosed in a sealed case which can be readily installed in the tank turret.

The image contains two illustrations. The first is a compass rose diagram with directions labeled. The second illustration shows a landscape with a person standing in the foreground and some hills or mountains in the background.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

HOW TO USE IT:
1. YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WITH FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "0" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.
2. ESTIMATE THE ANGULAR MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE SKY, AND PLACE A TICK MARK BETWEEN THE "X" AND "0" TO INDICATE THE SPEED AS FAST, MEDIUM, OR SLOW.
3. IF THE PHENOMENON HAS CHANGED DIRECTION WHILE UNDER OBSERVATION, PLACE ADDITIONAL "X'S" AND "0'S" AS APPROPRIATE TO SHOW CHANGES IN DIRECTION.
4. PLEASE INDICATE THE DIRECTIONAL CHANGES BY DRAWING LINES FROM THE CENTRAL POINT TO THE "X'S" AND "0'S". THIS IS MATHEMATICALLY IMPORTANT TO SHOW THE EXACT PATH OF MOVEMENT.
5. PLEASE BE AS CAREFUL AND AS EXACT AS POSSIBLE IN YOUR OBSERVATIONS. THIS IS VITAL TO ACCURATE EVALUATION BY PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS.
