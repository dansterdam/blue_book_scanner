AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DATE, 4-15-52
12-1/x/52
SUBJECT: Unidentified aerial objects observed by the weather observer, Corner Brook, Newfoundland.
1. METEOLOGICAL CONDITIONS: None noted which would have a bearing on this incident.
2. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None.
3. INTEREST OR IDENTIFICATION: None.
COMMENTS BY INFORMATION SOURCE: 
"Flying Saucer" was sighted in the sky when the weather observer, who has over 20 years experience, was checking with his binoculars an object (possibly a weather balloon) which he had noticed at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet. The object moved at a high rate of speed and changed direction at a sharp angle. It was under observation for about 1 minute.
In the draft of an article which he prepared for publication in the local paper but was advised not to publish by his Commanding Officer, he states that the object may not be considered a "slight wildling motion."

UNCLASSIFIED  
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT  
Report No. TN-55-52

Inc'l 1 -  
SAUCER AND BALLOON  
by Ohio Stage  

Now that the saucer and fid film have derived the flying saucer issue, there 
remains the problem of the unidentified portions of the saucer phenomenon. 

The truth of the matter is, I have intercepted radio comments from the crash 
or strike of a saucer at Chicahosta, Ohio, 9/10/52, 3:55 p.m., local time. 
His space dictionary, I have managed to decipher at least one message.

This message had to do with the very Chill when I believe to call the "Wil-
liams Loop." It appears that this is the concern and from the traffic report, 
(which are identical, you know) , it appears that the metallic saucer from the 
crash site is now a subject of very great interest.

It is quite evident that they are a race of intellirence, beings because one of 
their instructions was to remain completely inviolable, undetected until a certain 
date which appears to be 1-1-53.

Anyway, here is the message. Just as it interestingly, and the major do not his 
own conclusions. It was addressed to the Director of the FBI which a person would 
hardly find in the files of the Bureau of Investigation. 

Dear Chiefs: 

Following is an Earth message intercepted by Mr. R, an engineer in the form
of a teletype and may well be authentic. We shall keep you informed. We shall 
continue to monitor along with the comments of our crew psychologists.

How does it the answer? 
(Psychologist's comment - Obviously, these things are of a very primitive order 
and know very little of the world they live in. Have they are approaching us, 
the depth of the ignorance which covers a good portion of their minds?)

How high is the sky?
(Psychologist's comment - Evidently, their concepts of measurement and 
altitude are radically different from ours. What is the "illusion" that causes 
them to observe the flight of their ships in this strange manner?)

How much do I weigh? 
(Psychologist's comment - Apparently, this is in response to some attempt to 
weigh or measure the object which, according to the dialogue, appears to be
very heavy and difficult to complete full analysis. This would tend to confirm 
the metallic nature of the object and its extreme density.)

In what it leads to complete inaction. Some appear to be the more usual manner
while others evoke strange, unconventional responses which seem related to basic 
philosophical concepts foreign to us. The object and crew appear to be using
a peculiar logic for this statement. In fact, our observers report that the 
replies and reactions for this statement vary greatly and seem calculated to
confound and confuse our investigators. More time may be required to determine
the real purpose and meaning behind these strange answers.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DATE: 15 May 1952
PLACE: Corner Brook, Newfoundland
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

The text of the document is as follows:

The conclusions of this report have been classified 'UNCLASSIFIED' since in the opinion of those concerned no security information is involved.

The undersigned, based on the contents of this report, considered the possibilities of reported events indicating the following:

1. That the incident concerned was a military aircraft on a secret mission or test flight. This appears to be unlikely as no known aircraft of this type was reported to be in the area at the time.

2. That the incident concerned the presence of a natural phenomenon in the sky. This appears unlikely on the basis of the details and descriptions contained in the report.

3. That the incident concerned the presence of an unidentified flying object. This possibility seems the most likely on the basis of the available evidence.

Accordingly, we are unable to attribute the observations, which have been described, to any known or logical explanation. The complete lack of substantiating data on the part of the observers, however, makes it impossible to arrive at any definite conclusion.

We respectfully suggest that all means for investigating this incident be exhausted. It is considered that the determination of the true nature of this incident be given urgent and thorough attention.
