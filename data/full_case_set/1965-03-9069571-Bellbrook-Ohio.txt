35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

A stream of bright light - about the size of a quarter and seemed to be made of a metallic shiny substance - passing approximately a mile or mile and a half in a horizon direction moving very rapidly about 30-45 degrees above the horizon on March 30, 1965 at approximately 11:30 P.M. The object seemed to approach and move away very rapidly. It was triangular in shape and was observed for about a minute or less. The witness reported a number of people also seeing the same object at the same time in the Bellbrook, Ohio area.

UPO Report

While Duty Officer, I received a call from Mr. NO-2 who claimed that Telephone NO 2-52-67 had informed him that the same UFO that was reported on the 30th of March 1965, he said he saw a bright object other than a star similar to what the bright object had seen. He said he saw it at about 10:15 on the 30th. I then it appears from East to West and then it disappear.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but does not appear to contain a photograph. The sketch includes various angles and directions labeled, as well as a compass-like symbol in the bottom right corner.

Text transcribed from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the object to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same object to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show where you first saw the object, and a "B" on the compass to show where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
