9. COURSE
Irregular circle over Dayton area in a northerly direction, dispatcher was contacted at time, which was shooting landings and he stated that there were 2 T-33's in air at the time, and then when it was over the Wright-Patterson area it would go out again. This can be explained by fact that T-33 has two landing lights located in the wingtips, and upon landing wheels are extended, landing lights are to be one interior of 2 lights that disappeared to flying b. It is therefore concluded that lights observed by witnesses were those on an a/c.
10. SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
2 people saw a light in sky over Dayton area about 10-15 mins and he stated that there were 2 T-33's in air at the time, and then when it was over the Wright-Patterson area it would go out again. This can be explained by fact that T-33 has two landing lights located in the wingtips, and upon landing wheels are extended, landing lights are to be one interior of 2 lights that disappeared to flying b.

The image contains two sketches that depict how an unidentified flying object (UFO) may have appeared relative to the horizon (skyline) from the observer's perspective. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" to indicate the height of the object above the horizon, and a second curved line labeled "B" to show how high the object appeared to be from the observer's viewpoint when they first saw it. 

The second sketch shows a larger scene with a person standing on a road or pathway, with mountains or a landscape in the background. This sketch appears to be an example of how to complete a larger sketch to demonstrate the object's position when first seen.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
