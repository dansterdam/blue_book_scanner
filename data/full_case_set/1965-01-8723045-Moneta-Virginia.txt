PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14 SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS JANUARY 8, 1965
1790
REPORTED OBJECT . . . . . . . . : RED-ORANGE OBJECT WITH BLUE AND RED LIGHTS 
DATE AND TIME OF OBSERVATION: JANUARY , 1965, AT 4:40 A.M.
LOCATION OF OBSERVATION . . . : MONETA, VIRGINIA
WEATHER CONDITIONS . . . . . . : CLEAR
OBSERVED BY . . . . . . . . . . : STEWART A.P.S. 4T 
DURATION OF OBSERVATION . . . : ABOUT 5 MINUTES
DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVED OBJECT:
A BRIGHT RED-ORANGE LIGHT WAS OBSERVED IN THE SKY WITH FLASHING BLUE AND RED LIGHTS AROUND THE EDGE. IT APPEARED TO BE OVAL SHAPED AND WAS HOVERING. THE OBJECT SUDDENLY STARTED TO MOVE FAST AND THEN DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.
COMMENTS: 
THIS APPEARS TO BE A SIGHTING OF A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT, POSSIBLY A MILITARY AIRCRAFT, WHICH WAS ENGAGING IN NIGHT MANEUVERS. THE FLASHING LIGHTS AND HOVERING ATTITUDE ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF SUCH AIRCRAFT. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE DESCRIPTION TO SUGGEST THAT THIS WAS AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

HAVE VERY UNUSUAL AND UNNATURAL CHARACTERISTICS AS DID ITS M OTION. IT DID NOT HAVE
THE NORMAL TAIL, WINGS, AND OTHER CONFIGURATION OF KNOWN AIRCRAFT AND THEY
SEEMED TO DEFY NORMAL AERODYNAMICS. THERE WAS NO AUDIBLE SOUND AND THEY MOVED
WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED AND MANEUVERABILITY, MAKING EXTREMELY TIGHT AND ERRATIC
TURNS AND STOPS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. AT ONE POINT IT
SEEMED TO MAKE A MANEUVER THAT DEFIED GRAVITY. IT WAS NOT EASY TO GET A GOOD
VIEW BUT WHAT I SAW WAS VERY UNUSUAL AND I CANNOT SATISFACT ORILY EXPLAIN WHAT IT
WAS. THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON WHO SAW THIS ALSO AND I HAVE DISCUSSED IT WITH
HIM AND WE AGREE THAT IT W AS VERY STRANGE AND DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN. WE COULD
FIND NO RATIONAL EXPLANATION FOR WHAT WE SAW.

FURTHER INFORMATION BUT THE TRAIL SEEMED TO LEAD TO A DEAD END. THERE WAS NO
RESPONSE FROM USAF FACILITIES RELATING TO HAVING SCRAMBLED JETS OR INITIATED ANY
ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SIGHTINGS. LIKEWISE THERE WAS NO INDICATION
OF ANY UNIDENTIFIED OR UNUSUAL AIRCRAFT ACTIVITY BEING REPORTED BY MONITORING
STATIONS OR RADAR FACILITIES. THE SIGHTINGS REMAIN AN UNEXPLAINED INCIDENT
LACKING SATISFACTORY IDENTIFICATION OR EXPLANATION. IT IS DOUBTFUL IF ANY
FURTHER INFORMATION WILL BE OBTAINED RELATING TO THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT.

This image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report. The document describes an incident where no abnormal objects were observed on search or height finder radars, but the object seemed to be traveling at a higher rate of speed than previous objects observed. The document indicates that preliminary investigations were unable to identify these sightings with known air traffic or weather phenomena, and there were no physical effects to study. The document also notes the "existence of physical evidence" is "none" and refers to Section I of AF In 38297 (2 Feb 65).

SEPARATE BY APPROXIMATELY 15 MILES. THIS INDICATES A POSSIBLE CONFIRMATION, ESPECIALLY SINCE ONE UFO WAS OBSERVED BY TWO PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME. HOWEVER, THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVE, CIGAR-SHAPED VERSUS A SQUARE AS LARGE AS A FOOTBALL FIELD, CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO CONFIRM EACH OTHER. SINCE ALL THREE WITNESSES ARE RELIABLE, I MUST JUDGE THAT SOMETHING WAS OBSERVED IN EACH CASE. THE WEATHER BALLOONS CITED IN PARAGRAPH 3 MIGHT FIT THE CIGAR DESCRIPTION, BUT
I OFFER THIS AS ONLY A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION. I CAN OFFER NOTHING MORE DEFINITE.
L. EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE.
NOTE: SEC 1 IS AF IN 27397 (27 JAN 65)
