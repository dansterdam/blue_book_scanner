THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN BY THE OBSERVERS APPEARS EQUATE TO AN AIRCRAFT FLIGHT PATH. HOWEVER, THE RED FUELAGE LIGHT BLINKS AND THIS WAS DENIED BY THE OBSERVERS. THE T-33 FLIGHT OBSERVER COULD NOT HAVE CAUSED THIS REPORT DUE TO THE DIRECTION OF TAKEOFF AND TRAFFIC PATTERN. SATELLITES ARE HELD UNLIKELY DUE TO THE NORTHWARD MOTION OF THE OBJECT. MOST LIKELY CAUSE IS HELD TO BE THE SIGHTING OF AN AIRCRAFT ABOUT THE CLOUD DECK AND VISUAL MISINTERPRETATION OF THE ROTATING BEAM FOR TWINKLING OR VARYING INTENSITY.
