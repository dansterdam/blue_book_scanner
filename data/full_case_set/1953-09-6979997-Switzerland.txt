Official Business AFOIN-X
PLEASE SEND TO YOUR NEAREST AIR FORCE BASE

DATE: September 13, 1953, 2 AM (2:30 AM)
TIME OF SIGHTING: 2 AM
SIZE: It was four times as long as the wing of a passenger plane
SHAPE: Rectangular, see attached sketch
COMPOSITION: Six rows with fifteen dark windows per wing section 
SPEED: Within four (4) seconds sped through 45°, about 1,500 m/sec.
ALTITUDE: A height 1,500 m according to the stars drawn.
DIRECTION OF TRAVEL: The spacecraft flew from north to south.
MANEUVER PATTERN: The entire view is drawn four times actual size.
COLOR: One-half is "aluminum bronze", the other half dark.
SOUND: Soundless; the spaceship had no visible engines.
LENGTH OF TIME OBSERVED: The flight of 45° lasted only four (4) seconds.
SKY CONDITIONS: The stars were clearly visible.
VISIBILITY: The sun illuminated the spaceship from the east.
GROUND DIRECTION OF WIND: No wind.
NAME, AGE, MAILING ADDRESS OF OBSERVER: E. Jacquenod, (Aarau), Switzerland.
REMARKS: (General description of what you saw - use back if necessary) When it disappeared on the horizon, it required a seventh of a second to completely disappear. At the beginning, I thought it was about 3/8 the width of the back. In spite of the enormous speed, it was still 2,000 times less than that of light, that is, only interplanetary, if not interstellar.
