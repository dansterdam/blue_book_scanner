"Two Unidentified Etuning Observers in Bethel, Vermont, January 8, 1965.

Last night, January 8, 1965, Mr. Donald Smith and his wife, Mrs. Jean Smith, residents of Bethel, Vermont, observed two unidentified flying objects in the sky from their residence at the above address.

The first object was sighted at approximately 7:30 P.M. while the observers were watching television in their living room. They spotted a light through the window which appeared to be moving slowly from east to west at an estimated altitude of around 2000 feet. The object was described as round, reddish-orange in color, and pulsating.

After observing this object for a few minutes, another similar object was observed traveling in the same direction at a slightly higher altitude. This second object was also described as round, reddish-orange in color, and pulsating.

The two objects were in view for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before disappearing from sight. There were no sound effects associated with the objects. The observers stated that the objects appeared to be metallic in nature and were definitely not aircraft, satellites, or any other known type of aerial vehicle.

The observers, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, are reliable citizens of Bethel, Vermont, and this report is considered to be a credible sighting of two unidentified flying objects."

Dear Mr. Webb:

It was advised to me by communication of January 26, 1964, that a complete file of Project Blue Book case files involving Vermont incidents are in your possession and the State of Vermont is interested in obtaining copies of these files.

We have looked at the material with Dr. J. Allen Hynek previously and have photocopies of considerable material which have been distributed to various agencies. However, we would like you to send to this office, copies of the three minor Vermont incident files which were not among those copies previously distributed.

The addresses were:
1. 25-338 and occurring on December 23, 1957 near Bethel, Vermont.
2. 25-339 and occurring on January 8, 1958 near Bethel, Vermont.
3. 25-340 and occurring on January 8, 1958 near Bethel, Vermont.

These are the only Vermont files that we do not have copies of and we would appreciate your forwarding them to this office at your earliest convenience.

There are no notes at any time. This objective was to have all of the Vermont material assembled in one location and available for any future reference. 

Sincerely yours,

/s/ Donald W. Webster
Administrative Assistant

Text from the document:

Dear Walter Webb,
The original report of the object sighted (on January 8, 1965) by the witnesses covered extensive details and presented a reasonable account of the unusual observation. It appeared to the witnesses to be an extremely bright light or object, much brighter than the planet Venus, which was visible in the sky at the time. The witnesses are considered reliable and their reports were consistent.

Beyond that, we have been unable to determine any further details or evidence concerning the sighting. While the unusual nature of the observation is recognized, the Air Force has been unable to establish the identity of the object or to arrive at a satisfactory explanation.

It is regretted that we are unable to provide you with more specific information about this particular case. The reports received give full details as we have them.

Very truly yours,
(Signature)

DEACON OBSERVATORY 
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
EVANSTON, ILLINOIS

A REPORT ON THE BETHEL, VERMONT, SIGHTING OF 4 JANUARY 1956.

This case was investigated by Dr. J. Allen Hynek who visited Bethel, Vermont and interviewed several witnesses. After an essentially all day investigation, the conclusion of the interviewer is that, with a high degree of probability, the sighting was that of tracer bullets fired over the highway. These tracer bullets were observed indirectly according to the statements of the two Randolph men which seem to have the most weight, were that "the trail of tracer bullets is similar to the illumination of the Aluminum Battle of the American Flag at Bethel were lighted several times during World War II."

In addition to this comment, it is well-known that there are in the neighborhood who are given to playing pranks. It is relatively easy to obtain such tracer shells in the open market; and that there are no laws in Vermont prohibiting the use of such. It is quite understandable that even mature observers would be taken by surprise by such an unexpected and unusual phenomenon in view of the statements of the witnesses interviewed. It seems likely to the interviewer that the sighting was indeed the firing of tracer bullets across the highway.

Subject: Major Jockin M. Jacka

Dear Major Jacka:

Thank you for your prompt return letter of 27 January 1965 concerning the U.S. Air Force Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) report that was submitted through channels. I regret that the delay in responding to your letter is necessary, but as you know, a great deal of activity develops within this office in connection with the UFO program.

The purpose of this letter is to furnish you with some additional information pertaining to the report submitted on 6 January 1965 concerning an observed light in the sky over Bethel, Vermont. The report states that this light was observed for several minutes, and was followed by the appearance of a dark object which eventually disappeared from view.

Please be assured that all UFO reports received by this office are given thorough and complete analysis. We are deeply interested in acquiring all possible data concerning phenomena of this nature. To this end, we would appreciate your forwarding to this office any additional information or data that you might be able to provide, either from your own observation or from other reliable sources in your area. Any diagrams, sketches, or photographs would also be most helpful.

I hope you will convey our appreciation to the witnesses for their report. We consider these reports to be extremely valuable, and we are grateful for the cooperation we receive from citizens such as yourselves. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to call upon me.

Sincerely,

EDWARD J. RUPPELT, Major, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
Directorate of Intelligence

The text in the document is as follows:

I. ANALYSIS: Photographs were investigated but none were obtained. Witness reporting is considered very good and reliable.

II. THE UNBRANTED METEOR SHOWN:
A. DATE: Maximum - January 3 - 4
B. DURATION: Object was observed for approximately 4-5 seconds.
C. DESCRIPTIO: Compared to other stars, the object appeared larger, brighter, and of longer duration. It descended obliquely to the west at an angle of about 30 degrees to the horizon. a. The speed was estimated to be about 30 degrees per second which would indicate a high velocity.
b. The object appeared to be of saucerlike shape and at the time it seemed to pulsate or throb. 
c. The color was a brilliant white or whitish-blue.
d. No trail or exhaust was observed.
e. As it approached the horizon, it seemed to increase in brightness and size.
f. At that time it disappeared suddenly and completely. No fragments or debris were observed.

D. CHARACTERISTICS POINTING TO OUR CONCEPT OF METEORS IN THIS CASE:
A. SPEED: Despite the very high rate of motion, this is consistent with the known high velocity of meteors.
B. BRILLIANCE AND DURATION: These are not unusual for a bright meteor.
C. TRAIL: No visible trail. Very unusual for a meteor.
D. SHAPE: Such of it was seen, the saucerlike shape is not typical of meteors.
E. ALTITUDES: An apparent significant drop in altitude during the sighting is not common meteor behavior.

- page 19 -

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

OUTPUT TEXT:

"DIST/CHGH: 1/2 - 1 mile estimated.
G. FLIGHT PATH: Each followed an identical path, straight and level flight at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet. No turns, no changes in speed or altitude were observed.
H: TIME: These you can see why a UFO Report was filled. In September 1965, both these witnesses had an encounter with a unusual object while traveling along Rt. 107, close to the town of Bethel, Vermont.
Their attention was first attracted by a bright intense light in the sky some distance ahead of them. This light appeared to be stationary at first but as they approached, it suddenly started to move in a horizontal direction. It appeared to be a circular object which was emitting a very bright glow. It was not a pulsing light but rather a continuous type of emission.
The object remained in view for some 3-4 minutes and then suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared over the horizon.
COMMENTS: This is another very good report which seems to have been compiled objectively and without any obvious attempt to sensationalize the incident. The length of observation, 3-4 minutes, is quite adequate to provide useful details, and the speed of acceleration observed when the object left the scene is certainly well beyond the capabilities of any conventional aircraft.
The fact that two independent witnesses saw the same thing and described it in similar terms lends added credence to the report.

Yours sincerely,
RAYMOND F. FOWLER

Mr. Raymond E. Fowler

Church Street
Wenham, Massachusetts

Dear Mr. Fowler:

Please excuse the delay in answering your letter of February 4, but our medical work has been so heavy these past few days that I have had an opportunity to respond to it quite as quickly as I would have liked. 

I am amazed that the major could not come up with a single positive fact to sustain the theory that the major injuries were, in fact, caused by something other than a normal automobile accident. That I am amazed that "he could not come up with" a positive fact to sustain his theory is an understatement.

While I do not feel free to comment concerning Trooper Lane's comments, I am quite sure to recognize one when I see it. I can say for myself that numerous unsolicited communications in the past and again just lately had all the appearance of a moving object such as this case would suggest. However, I do not wish to make any assumptions beyond that point.

I shall assisting Corporati on of this report to you, and suggest that the might also see fit to write you concerning this matter.

By one final comment on the matter is that while I make these as to what the charges or may not have been, I do feel definitely that they were not meteors.

FRIDAY, MAY 13, 1965
BETHEL, VERMONT

3 UFOS WENT FLYING BY

On May 6, 1965, Herman Holbrook was suddenly awakened at 3:00 a.m. by a noise. Looking out the window, he saw 3 unidentified flying objects (UFOs) moving rapidly through the sky. They were large, round objects with bright lights and were traveling at a very high rate of speed. He estimated they were about 1,000 feet above the ground. The objects were moving very rapidly and he was able to observe them for only a brief period of time as they passed out of sight. He estimated their speed at about 500 mph.
On the following Monday between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m., Mr. Holbrook and a neighbor, Meryl Welch, were having a conversation and observed another UFO in the sky. This object was somewhat smaller than the previous ones and also had bright lights. It traveled at a very high rate of speed across the sky in a southeasterly direction and soon passed out of sight.
Mr. Holbrook reported these sightings to the Bethel Police Department and also notified the local newspaper, the Bethel Courier.

5 More Report 
"They Saw Those
Bethel 'Saucers'"
Burlington, Vt, Jan, 21---(AP)---Three members of a Bethel, Vt. family reported to Vermont State Police today that they had seen unusual objects in the sky on the evening of Jan 18. 
Bernard S. Woodruff, told police that about 5:45 p.m. on that date, he and his wife and son saw three bright, luminous objects in the sky moving in an erratic manner. He said the objects, which appeared to be about 1,000 feet up, were at first stationary and then moved rapidly off in different directions.
Woodruff said a short while later the three objects reappeared and again moved about erratically in the sky. He estimated they were visible about five minutes on each occasion.
No sound was heard, Woodruff said, and the objects appeared to be about the size of a basketball when seen.
The Woodruff family were among a number of Vermonters who said they saw unexplained objects in the sky on the evening of Jan. 18.

15 APRIL 1955

This is my opinion of what I feel of this situation of being led to this information. I should like to ask whether you have any additional information on the case, this matter. To your knowledge, were there any additional reports made up at that time which I have not as yet been informed about. 

I would stress on one point, that the limited information I have is not as yet definitive, in my opinion. The details I have been given so far are indeed sketchy and lacking in specificity. I cannot yet arrive at a conclusion that would be definitive.

Thus, I would appreciate it if you would have a closer look at the additional information which may be on file. If new data has come to light since the original report, then I would be most interested in reviewing it. This could provide the necessary detail to make a more comprehensive assessment.

I hope that you will agree with the need for this additional information. It is my desire to arrive at as complete and accurate an understanding of this incident as possible. Please let me know if you can assist me further in this regard.

Sincerely yours,

On the night of January 17, 1965, at Richard S. Woodruff's home in Bethel, Vermont, many strange lights were observed by the witness moving at such high speed that they were hard to follow. The objects seemed to be round or circular and there were many of them moving at a high speed. At times, the objects seemed to hover and then dart off at a terrific speed.

Pathologist Views UFO
Mr. Richard S. Woodruff, Vermont pathologist and part-time Vermont UFO investigator, was driving on Route 107 in Bethel, Vermont on December 26, 1964, and a Vermont state trooper, who was conducting a routine patrol, was riding with him. Around 6:30 p.m. they both sighted a bright light which seemed to be hovering over the tree tops. The Free Press, Rutland, Vermont, carried the first news account of this incident. Woodruff was quoted as stating that the object approached very rapidly and that "it scared the daylights out of me," as he viewed it pass below the level of his car. He estimated the object to be about 20 to 30 feet in diameter. It appeared to be a solid round object with a semi-luminous glow around the rim. As it passed, it tilted slightly as if viewing the ground, then it seemed to accelerate and disappear at a great rate of speed. A little later, the trooper and Woodruff saw the object again as it seemed to be following the same line of flight, but at a considerable distance. The object appeared to be found, but they were unable to locate it on their return. Woodruff is quoted as stating that the Unidentified Flying Object appeared to be metallic in nature and was moving with no discernible means of propulsion. He considered it a classic UFO sighting, but he was unable to determine the nature or origin of the object.

Tektites and the Cyrillic Shower

JAMES A. O'KEEFE, Goddard Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration

THE LAUNCHING of more than 30,000 small satellites on a number of occasions between November 8, 1957, has astonished many people. This deliberate action, continuing in the years since, has been misunderstood by the public. It is widely believed that the satellites were put into orbit for purely scientific purposes, but there is some reason to believe that this is not true. Instead, the launching was part of a series of unusual natural events occurring in the earth's environment, the full significance of which is not yet appreciated.

On February 12, 1958, the United States announced the recovery of tektites from the surface of the earth. These glasslike objects, first discovered many years ago and distributed over wide areas, have been a subject of scientific research and speculation. The announcement indicated that one area of particular scientific interest concerned the launching or origin of the tektites.

The tektites are believed to be ejected from the earth's surface by natural processes, violently ejecting small solid masses of silicate glass into the atmosphere to fall back to earth in a shower. Some scientists believe the tektites may have originated in a violent impact on the earth's surface, or possibly from the eruptions of volcanoes, but no completely satisfactory explanation of their origin has yet been given.

During the past several years, a strange phenomenon has been observed in the earth's upper atmosphere, known as the "Cyrillic shower." This phenomenon consists of a large number of visible luminous trails in the night sky, often described as resembling letters of the Cyrillic alphabet. The exact cause of these luminous trails is not known, but they may be associated with the launching of the artificial satellites.

An attempt is now being made to relate the tektite phenomenon to the Cyrillic shower. It is believed that the tektites and the Cyrillic shower may both be the result of a common cause, and that this common cause may be associated with the launching of artificial satellites. The full significance of these events is not yet understood, but they appear to be part of a complex series of natural and artificial events occurring in the earth's environment.

The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a page from a historical UFO report document. The image shows a diagram or illustration that appears to be related to the report. 

The text from the document is as follows:

Miss Catherine Martinka, Bethel, Vermont, had a strange experience on the night of August 15, 1965, about 8:00 p.m. According to her report, she was watching television when suddenly the set went off. She then looked out the window and saw a bright circular or oval object which seemed to be hovering over the area. The object was bright white in color and seemed to have lights around the edges. It remained in place for about 5 minutes and then moved slowly to the east and disappeared. Miss Martinka reported that during the time the object was visible, the television set remained off. She said the object was about the size of a full moon and that it gave off no sound.
On the same night, at about 9:00 p.m., a similar object was observed by Mrs. Louis Gravel, who lives about a mile from Miss Martinka. Mrs. Gravel reported that the object was circular in shape, bright white in color, and that it seemed to have lights around the edge.
The diagram appears to show some kind of flight trajectory or path related to the reported UFO sighting.

Transcribing the text from the document:

Results of a search throughout the coastal regions of the United States indicated in the 1954 saucer predictions. Investigate the possibility of this project receiving approval for a scientific study of the sighting reports that may have been generated in these areas. The newspapers along the Coast have carried many reports and it may be possible to locate additional information on this subject by a careful analysis of these data.

The details are given, apparently as a result of searches conducted in various coastal regions of the United States, following predictions made in 1954 regarding sightings of unidentified flying objects. The text discusses investigating the possibility of approving a scientific study to analyze any reports of sightings that may have been generated in these coastal areas, based on information from local newspapers.

The image contains a photograph showing a sketch or diagram of an apparent unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch depicts an elliptical or disc-shaped object with a ring or halo around it. There is also some text surrounding the image, describing aspects of the observed object and the circumstances of the sighting.

Extracted text from the document:

The first possible explanation is that the object observed was a large bird, or possibly a small plane, which had made a rapid pass near the observer. However, the observer is confident that the object was not a plane, and the size and speed of the object makes it unlikely to have been a large bird. The object was observed for a period of about 10 to 20 seconds.

Another consideration is that the object could have been a reflection of some kind, possibly from the sun, although the observer does not believe this to be the case. The observer feels certain that the object was a real physical object, and not a reflection or illusion.

The object was described as being elliptical in shape, with a bright light or halo surrounding it. It appeared to be hovering, and then accelerated very rapidly, disappearing from view within 10 to 20 seconds. The observer reported that the object did not appear to be controlled by any visible means of propulsion.

The document also includes some technical details and calculations related to the observed object, such as its estimated size, speed, and altitude. Overall, the report appears to be a detailed account of an unidentified aerial phenomenon observed by the witness.

"So many years of the world, how, never, been. and black Reliefs have been found for the bearings where they were not really watched up, when these were discovered. Truly these events is strange and wonderful, to be regarded is not altogether unknown in a serious of events in consideration. 
A second or a more visit of this nature of events, that may be looked forward to a discovery in the near future. 
weather conditions, which could be associated with a manifestation of some form, which could not at this time be explained in any known natural phenomena.
In many areas of the country the conditions have been analyzed and have been found to contain a higher content of certain minerals in the soil, which in the concentration found, indicates the possibility of a magnetic disturbance. It is interesting to speculate whether this higher content of certain minerals is the result of the event rather than the cause. I.e. were they brought from somewhere else into the area to produce the unusual effects noted?
It is even possible to form some idea as the the possible nature of the material involved, which could produce the effects described, from the study of the elements and their peculiar properties. Such elements are known to science which might well produce the effects described, when combined under suitable conditions.
It is believed that with further investigation it may be possible to determine with a reasonable degree of certainty, whether the manifestation of this phenomena is the result of a natural occurrence or whether there is a possibility of a technological means, possibly from an extraterrestrial source, being involved.
On the whole, I f feel that the evidence points to the fact that phenomena does exist which cannot be fully explained by any known scientific theory, and the ultimate origin of the body which produces this phenomena must remain an unsolved mystery. I feel that a great deal more fundamental research is necessary before we can arrive at any definite conclusions."
