Incident #137 -- Pacific Ocean 19º 03' N., 164º 05' E -- 4 May 1943

The object observed here was probably an exploding fire-
ball seen head-on and seen only at the time of actual explosion.
This, with partial cloud cover, could easily explain the absence
of a trail.

It is not likely that it was situated on the water surface
or aircraft sighted later had any relation to the original object.

If the object had been a shell fired from the USS xxxxx,
it appears improbable that only one shell would have been observed.

TO: Chief, Air Weather Service,
     Andrews Air Force Base,
     Washington 25, D. C.
     ATTN: DS9

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investigation and interpretation of data relative to sightings of unidentified flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries 1 thru 172 from the files of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendations as to which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on ball lightning. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are checked by the Intelligence Department of this Command. These checks are usually made direct from the Project "SIGN" office, MCIAK0-3. Those checks are distinct from the check of synoptic balloon flights made by weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department of Commerce. (U. S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed incidents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This list does not eliminate the possibility that any of the remaining incidents are balloons.

          ATTENTION ADC, Intelligence

1. The following information was reported by Captain Floyd 
Barnes, Pilot of aircraft, who was in flight between Kwajalein island,
Marshall Islands, and Hickam Field, T. H., at the time the indent
occurred.

2. While flying magnetic course 060°, altitude 9000 feet, at 
approximately 09:05 GCT, 6 May 1948, a large white ball of fire was 
observed 19° 05' E - 164° 05' E, four to five miles directly ahead 
and slightly above the aircraft. The ball of fire was observed 
for only a split second and was comparable to the explosion of a 
shellor there was no stream or trail observed usually 
related to a meteor of a distress signal.

3. Immediately after the ball of fire was observed, Captain 
Barnes instructed the Radio Operator to check the IFF. The IFF was
reported by the Radio Operator to be in position No. 2 and operative.

4. As the aircraft approached the approximate position of 
where the ball of fire was observed, a single white light was seen 
on the water surface. However, this light was obscured within a few 
seconds after sighting because of the existing cloud coverage 
(qu;= 5/10).

5. More lights were immediately observed on the water surface 
approximately ten miles north of the aircraft's course. It is the
opinion of Captain Barnes and other persons aboard who observed these
lights, that it was a surface vessel.

6. Approximately ten minutes elapsed after the last light
was observed on the water surface, when an aircraft was sighted
flying a reciprocal course (240°) at about 1000 feet below the 
DOWN GRADED AT 5 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.

The document appears to be declassified and part of the Project Blue Book UFO investigations, reporting an incident involving a sighting of a large white ball of fire, followed by lights over the water surface, witnessed by an aircraft pilot and crew.

The text from the document reads as follows:

---

A large white ball of fire was observed some four to five miles directly ahead of and slightly above the aircraft. It was observed for only a split second and was comparable to the explosion of a shell There were no streamers or "tails" observed such as usually related to a meteor or a distress signal. As the aircraft progressed the approximate position where the ball of fire was observed a single white light was seen on the water surface. However, this disappeared within a few seconds after sighting because of the setting cloud coverage. More lights were immediately observed on the water surface some 10 miles north of the plane's course. It is the opinion of the witness (Capt Barnes) that these were from a surface vessel. Some 10 minutes elapsed after these lights were observed on the water surface when an aircraft was sighted flying a reciprocal course (240°) at about 1000 ft below the observer's aircraft and slightly to the right of the course. Capt Barnes made numerous attempts to contact this aircraft on Channel "B" and "D", "Y" but acknowledgment of his transmission was never received.
