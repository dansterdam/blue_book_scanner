SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
5th AF ATLO 18-29-57 PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

1. On 10 November 1957 an unidentified object was observed to the west-southwest of Misawa Air Base, Japan. This object was described as being round in shape and resembling a dull reddish-orange color. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes before it disappeared from view. There was a distinct tail which appeared to be several miles long which also disappeared with the object. The report stated that the object appeared twice in 15 minutes, first sighted for 10 minutes, then reappeared 5 minutes later in a different direction for an additional 10 minutes before disappearing again.

2. The object was observed by chance and disappeared by fading out. Time of observation was approximately 0915/15.

3. Observations reported were visual, unassisted by optical devices.

4. Sighting occurred between 0945 and 1005/15.

5. Observers were located at approximately 39째 26' N 141째 22' E and 39째 33' N 141째 25' E.

6. The observers included Lt Col Marshal, E. Halley, AG 1CC0539, Japan-Korea Weather Reconnaissance Flight Air Force: Masahide ITAGAKI, Intelligence Commander, Naval Forces, Japan.

7. The time of the sighting was clear with visibility better than 10 miles. Observers reported 3-5 seconds visibilty at the time of sighting, made from 10,000 ft. to approximately 20,000 ft.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
In the Tokyo area during the reported time period at this time of night, conditions are sufficiently clear to enable visual sighting if the object existed. The report indicates that the object was observed a total of 15 minutes, with two distinct appearances. The absence of a description of the actual sighting and the failure to obtain any photographic evidence leads one to believe that this object was probably a meteor. The observers, apparently, mistook it for a "flying saucer" after the actual observation. The observers did not actually view the object assume that it was probably a meteor observed visually from an aircraft in flight.

General Watson has requested that the reports written by the subject collectors in November be evaluated and the value and quality of the reports be determined.

It is therefore requested that your office prepare Forms 112b on the enclosed reports. The comments section of the Form 112b should discuss the ART value of the information, the utility of the reports, and the extent of the information received and the evaluations and reports be returned to AFCIN-4A2a by 27 January 1958.

COMMENTS: (Narrative style, expand on your evaluation and analyze) This report describes a visual sighting of unidentified flying objects over Tokyo, Japan on 6 November 1957. The observer (a Tokyo resident) gave the following description: "At approximately 8:25 p.m. on 6 November 1957, I observed three circular, luminous objects in the sky over Tokyo. The objects were traveling at a high rate of speed and were maneuvering in unison. They appeared to be under intelligent control. The objects were visible for approximately 30 seconds before disappearing from view." The observer reported the incident to the local police station. 
1. This case can be properly evaluated or analyzed towards some valid conclusion on the identity of the UFOs.
2. US and overseas units should measure all efforts to complete investigations and local checks, to identify UFOs or to obtain sufficient data, which, without confirmation of the reporting unit's conclusions (i.e., contents of the report), an analysis can be made. Ref: AFR 200-2.
3. Attempts made could have been obtained if operations or investigations were as outlined in par. 5, AFR 200-2, particularly checks with military and civil air operations, to include radar units if anything unusual or aircraft were seen in the air at the time reported.
4. Using minimum "time-in-sight" of 30 seconds, doubt arises if object was a jet aircraft traveling at supersonic speed. Jet objects are generally observable for 5 - 7 seconds or by. Factors, such as altitude, size and speed, are all factors which can be determined if complete instrumentation and adequate investigative checkpoints were obtained.
5. There is a considerable amount of air traffic crisscrossing Japan. Checks show close with our own military guards. Particularly in air lanes or civil air traffic areas, which could be visually confused as being unidentified until recognition.
No comment or subsequent action required here as the incident apparently seems to be a normal air operation.

COMMENTS (To narrative refer, expand on your findings and recommendations and conclusions with full guidance and helpful criticisms re-garding the report. Comment on the significance or significance if the report reflects adverse conditions):
As a result of the observations of a colored light streaming across the sky over Tokyo, there were of little value, although admittedly the UFO could be a meteorite, if the sightings Cine-in-sight reported were over estimated. However, this Center cannot conduct on-the-spot investigations and detailed checks, it must rely on the overseas tracking the sightings.
