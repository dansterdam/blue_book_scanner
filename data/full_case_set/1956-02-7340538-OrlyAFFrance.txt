2. Description of course of object:
a. It was sighted by the pilot at 2000 ft MSL as he climbed out of Marseille, France in a C-119 aircraft.
b. The object was 10° above the horizon at 350°. The distance of the object from the aircraft was estimated to be 10 to 20 miles.
c. The object was 10° above the horizon at 270°. The distance was an estimated 5 to 10 miles.
d. When first sighted, on the climb out, the object was as described in b above and it appeared stationary. However, when it was sighted again as described in c above, the object started to move away from the observer, as if slowly burning out. At this time the observers were just north of Montellmar, France, at 3500 ft MSL.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Preparing Office: A.C.A.S., 2-2, Twelfth Air Force Carrier Group, Medium 
Subject: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
Date of Report: 18 FEB 1956
Date of Information: 8 Feb 56
EVALUATOR: A-1

SUMMARY: (Four words deleted) report covers the sighting of an unidentified object by three airmen. The observers did not consider this incident worthy of a report until they read an article in the New York Herald Tribune (European Edition) on 25 February 1956. This article appeared to be similar to their sighting.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be text-based content from a Project Blue Book document.

The text in the image reads:

The first observers were workers at the airport of Orly, France, near Paris. They noticed bright lights in the sky at 7:30 P.M. of Feb. 29th, 1956. The lights, circling rapidly, could be seen going through maneuvers at an incredible speed. They were estimated to be 1,200 miles per hour. The objects were picked up Friday night by radar operators at Orly International Airport. The Air Force spokesman said the objects, apparently metallic, were not foreign aircraft observed in this area before, and there is no satisfactory explanation as to their identity. Radar observations indicate the objects were beyond the capacity of the fastest jets to intercept.

On February 18, the Soviets warned the U.S. that they can now deliver bombs all over the world by either plane or rocket.

On this same date, Paris reported a mystery object in the skies. Described as twice as large as an ordinary commercial airliner, it was tracked on radar screens by Orly Airport officials. Traveling at an estimated 1,500 miles an hour, the object appeared over the Paris region late last evening and seemed to hover for a few minutes before disappearing at high speed.

A Paris reporter writing on February 20 said that some radars had caught the blip, others hadn't. He also wrote that an incoming pilot, "alerted to the UFO", saw only a blinking red fire. The pilot said that the object did not show up on his radar.

The image appears to contain two newspaper clippings or articles. The larger one on the left seems to be a news article describing some kind of UFO or "phantom" sighting at an airfield. The smaller one on the right looks like a classified advertisement or announcement of some kind.

Text from the document:

PARIS 23- (UP) - THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SOUGHT TODAY TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF A FLYING OBJECT WHICH CROSSED THE AIRFIELD AT ORLY AIRPORT AT SUCH A TREMENDOUS SPEED THAT THE CONTROL TOWER RADAR SCREENS COULD NOT TRACK IT. FRENCH ARMY OFFICIALS SAID THE OBJECT PASSED AT AN ESTIMATED 1,000 MILES AN HOUR, FASTER THAN SOUND, IN FULL VIEW OF THE INTERNATIIONAL AIRPORT'S RADAR EQUIPMENT. THEY SAID THE OBJECT WAS PICKED UP ON RADAR SCOPES AS IT ENTERED THE BUSY INTERNATIONAL AIRFIELD OUTSIDE PARIS AND THAT ITS SPEED WAS CALCULATED TO BE OVER 1,000 MILES AN HOUR. THE PHANTOM HAS NEVER BEEN EXPLAINED, THEY SAID. IT WAS SIGHTED BY TOWER AND FIELD CONTROL AND WAS CAUGHT BY RADAR FOR ABOUT TWO SECONDS. REPORTS SAID IT WAS SEEN AGAIN LATER IN THE EVENING OVER ANOTHER PART OF FRANCE. THE SPEED OF THE OBJECT WAS SO TREMENDOUS THAT THE RADAR EQUIPMENT WAS IN EXCELLENT WORKING CONDITION AND COULD NOT FOLLOW THE OBJECT WHICH FLASHED BY THEM IN LESS THAN TWO SECONDS. THE AREA IN WHICH THE RADAR PLACED THE "PHANTOM" AFTER TAKING OFF FROM THE AIRPORT CONTAINED LIGHTS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN PART OF THE OBJECT.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:
Or a Flying Saucer?
"Mystery of Paris Sky: Flying Cognac Bottle?"
By Frank Kelley

PARIS, Feb. 6 (AP) - Several experts are at work trying to find out what was seen in the sky near or at Orly Airport last Saturday that four French fighter plane pilots said they sighted and chased for four hours.
The pilots reported they saw a mysterious object that climbed to an altitude of more than 10,000 feet and at times put on bursts of speed up to 2,000 miles an hour.
Some say it may have been another one or several of these American meteorological balloons that have been found in various parts of Europe.
But the pilots, Michel Chevaye, Henri Baretta, Georges Prioux and Rene Zuber, said the object they chased had the shape of a flattened sphere or a "cognac bottle" that changed color from orange to white.
They said they fired on it and it disappeared. The French Air Ministry has the pilots' report and is investigating.
The Director of the National Aeronautics and Meteorological Research Center in Paris said the object is a mystery the center cannot explain. He said the pilots' description did not fit any known aerial device.
"It cannot be explained by any natural phenomenon," he said. "We are at a loss to know what it was."
