PROJECT 10279 RECORD
2. LOCATION Irvington, New Jersey
10. CONCLUSION: Probable "HOT AIR BALLOON"
Description is consistent with those of a hot air carriot balloon.
11. CHIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observers witnessed a bright light which was found to be a hot air balloon that had an electronic device attached and was some distance from which the observers were located. This was a similar object from which the observers thought they had seen earlier, but upon closer examination was found to be a hot air balloon and not an unidentified flying object.

I observed a strange object in the evening sky over Irvington, New Jersey. It appeared to be round, and had a silvery metallic appearance. It was at an altitude of approximately 1000 to 1500 feet and was moving in an irregular pattern, sometimes stopping and hovering, then moving off again. I watched it for about 20 minutes before it disappeared. The object did not make any sound that I could hear. I am a 25 year old male, and was alone at the time of the sighting. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I almost forgot this sighting we were having a family outside and noticed a bright light in the distance near the trees moving rather fast, it moved very strange from side to side and then stopped then moved some more then stopped again the light was very bright than it went out. I haven't thought much about this sighting since it happened but it certainly was strange the way it moved.
