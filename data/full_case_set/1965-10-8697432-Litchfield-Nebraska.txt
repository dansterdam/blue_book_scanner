11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object was an olive green and size of a wash tub, with tapered ends, rising from the ground, descended at a slight angle, and disappeared in clouds. At the time of the observation, it was partially obscured. Possible source based on duration and flight characteristics. Description not in correlation with this analysis. Possible that the appearance was distorted by the atmospheric conditions. REEVALUATION indicates balloon sighting (or debris in wind).

This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. However, there are several diagrams and illustrations present.

The first diagram appears to show an angular trajectory or path of an object in the sky, with angles and elevation measurements labeled. The second diagram is a compass rose or navigation diagram, showing the cardinal directions.

As per your instructions, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
