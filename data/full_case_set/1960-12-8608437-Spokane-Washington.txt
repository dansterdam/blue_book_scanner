REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
 
3 DECEMBER 1960
SPOKANE, WASHINGTON

On 3 December 1960, at approximately 0520 hours, the reporting witness, a man, observed an unidentified flying object near Spokane, Washington. The object was described as oval in shape, white in color, and giving off a bright light. The witness estimated the object to be about 40 feet in diameter and at an altitude of 500 to 1000 feet. The object was observed for approximately 3 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared.

The witness, whose name is withheld for privacy reasons, was driving his car on a rural road near Spokane, Washington, when he first observed the object. He stopped his car and watched the object for the duration of the sighting. No other witnesses were reported. The object did not interfere with the operation of the witness's car.

The weather at the time of the sighting was clear, with moderate winds. No other aircraft were observed in the area at the time.

The reporting witness was interviewed by Air Force personnel and provided a signed statement describing his observations. Based on the witness's description and the circumstances of the sighting, the object was determined to be unidentified.

Text Extracted from the Document:

On December 2-13 the Atlantic City Press reported that several UFOs were sighted in southwestnew Jersey. In one case a strange flying object which descended to about 800 feet was reported by a duck hunter. When he raised his shotgun, the hunter said, "the UFO immediately and disappeared."

On December 23rd, a duck hunter named L.J. Jersey, near his Cloye, New Jersey home had a frightening experience when he and his grandson were prepared to go duck hunting. They saw an object which they described as "a disc about 50 feet in diameter, coming toward them at a tremendous speed and then hovered a few feet off the ground. It was about 200 feet away. It was reported to be glowing and orange in color. As it went down, it changed to a reddish glow that lit up the ground and everything around it. The object then shot straight up and out of sight at a terrific speed."

New Jersey disclosed his story of a recent encounter with a big disc, 40 to 50 feet in diameter, which appeared to be maneuvering with a strange, white light on a hunting trip with his grandson at 6 a.m. they saw an object flying at them, over the meadows at about 200 feet above the ground. "Non-cohere that's coming right at us," cried the boy, and the boy's shotgun accidentally slipped into his shotgun and replied, "Don't worry if he comes at us. I'll shoot it." As he reached toward the gun, it seemed to veer off and went a distance away. It came out of the east, then turned northward. The disc maneuvered about 60 feet in altitude, had a red glow that lit up the group and that changed to purple as it rose vertically. It came out of the east, then turned northward. The disc maneuvered about 60 feet in altitude, had a red glow that lit up the group and that changed to purple as it rose vertically. It came out of the east, then turned northward. The disc maneuvered about 60 feet in altitude, had a red glow that lit up the group and that changed to purple as it rose vertically. The observer stated that it seemed to dissolve into the distance. "The chase wasn't there," he told the boys, "but you'd have a hard time telling these people that it wasn't there in the first place."

smaller objects seemed to remain at a similar level. These objects were observed for
approximately 5 minutes. They then seemed to gain more altitude and disappeared from

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

DATE 23 AUG 1960 
LOCATION Spokane, Washington 
CLASSIFICATION CONFIDENTIAL
CASE CATEGORY Sighting Report
CASE NUMBER 8608437
DATE RECEIVED 8 December 1960
DATE INVESTIGATED 23 Aug 1960
INVESTIGATOR Robert E Jones, Major, USAF
SUBJECT Unidentified Aerial Object Sighting
SYNOPSIS: Witness reported observing a bright light moving rapidly in the sky. Object appeared to be under intelligent control.

DETAILS: Mrs. John X Doe, 2301 NW Broadway, Spokane, Washington, reported that on the evening of 23 August 1960 at approximately 2100 hours, she observed a bright light moving rapidly in the western sky. The object appeared to be under intelligent control and made several abrupt changes in direction and speed. The object was visible for approximately 2 minutes before disappearing from view.

Mrs. Doe stated that the object appeared to be a single point of light, brighter than any star, and gave off an intense white light. She further stated that the object moved with a rapid, darting motion, making several sharp turns and stops during the sighting. Mrs. Doe reported the incident to the United States Air Force.

INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS: Based on the witness's description, this appears to have been a genuine sighting of an Unidentified Aerial Object. The rapid, darting motion and apparent intelligent control of the object are characteristic of many UFO sightings. Further investigation is warranted to determine the nature and origin of the object observed.

DISPOSITION: Case remains open and under investigation.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
2-12 DECEMBER 1960
ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY

On December 2-12, the Atlantic City Press reported that several UFOs were sighted in southern New Jersey. In one case listed by the Press, a strange flying object which descended to about 500 feet was reported by a duck hunter. When he raised his shotgun, the hunter said the UFO rapidly and disappeared.

NEW JERSEY HUNTER ALMOST SHOOTS SAUCER: Last December 3rd, a duck hunter near Atlantic City, New Jersey disclosed his story of a recent encounter with a big disc. As he prepared to shoot off a firecracker to attract ducks with a shotgun while on a hunting trip with his grandson at a lake, they saw an object flying at them, over the waters at about 200 feet above the ground.

"We got so excited, that's certain right," cried the boy, as the disc-shaped object swooped down and hovered right over us, clipping into his shotgun and flipped out. Don't worry if I'm come at us, I'll shoot it." As it wheeled, it rose vertically up in the air and disappeared. It came out of the east, then turned southwest. The disc traveled silently and moved with a jerky motion "like a humming bird" in the air. The object was about the size of a saucer and was a dull gray that lit up the group and changed to purple as it rose vertically. It came out of the east, then turned southwest. The disc traveled silently and moved with a jerky motion "like a humming bird" in the air. The object was about the size of a saucer and was a dull gray that lit up the group and changed to purple as it rose vertically. It came out of the east, then turned southwest.
