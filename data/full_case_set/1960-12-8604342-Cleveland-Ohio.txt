The reliable citizens observed an object of the site of a full moon. It was brightly lighted and maneuvered at a high rate of speed. The object seemed to be intelligently controlled and displayed no wings or other visible means of propulsion.

The witness observed the object for approximately 15 minutes and estimated its size to be 25 to 30 feet in diameter. The object gave off a bright white light and moved at a tremendous rate of speed, slowing down and stopping abruptly.
