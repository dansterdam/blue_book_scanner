The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch shows a saucer-shaped object with a dome-like structure on top. The text accompanying the sketch describes the witness's observation of the UFO, stating that it was sighted drifting south and east on the west side of a house. The witness mentions that the object made a humming noise and appeared to be about the size of a bushel basket. The text also includes some additional commentary about the appearance and behavior of the observed object.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

Lasted at 6:09 p.m. 4/11/55
Beugt at 9:08 a.m. of the observed flying object. Was sighting south and east on the west side of the house. At drifting in any, I'm thin it made a noise, humming and soft, East. Cost, it moved slowly. And again, almost of its one, and then the second time, it disappeared over the same way you came. I saw it for about 1 minute, but it looked like a bushel basket in size. When it stopped it looked like a ashape, whish was up, and a brush head in the center.

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report from the Project Blue Book UFO investigation. 

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

July 13
This report refers to a call that I received in about 5:00 A.M. A witness shot what appeared to be a bright light and went back to bed. The witness claimed that the object was round and bright and stayed in the same spot for quite some time. The witness was uncertain if it was a star, planet, or aircraft. The object was also reported to have made a slight movement around 5:15 A.M. The object was observed from 4:00 A.M. - 5:00 A.M. It had been seen, but looked stagnant at first. It would appear as a bright light and then become dull, and then bright again, suggesting some kind of pulsing. The witness felt that something was not quite normal about the object.
I would appreciate an analysis to determine what the witness actually observed. This report is written at 5:00 A.M.
