UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #229 -- South Bay, Florida -- 13 November 1948
#228a -- Riviera Beach, Florida -- 14 November 1948

There seem to be two separate occurrences reported in
this incident, but the information given for each is entirely
insufficient for adequate analysis.

In #229, the location of the object in the sky is not
given, nor is the hour of observation. The moon and Jupiter were
visible in the early evening, the moon quite high, and Jupiter
setting in the west. One might hazard a guess that Jupiter seen
through a variable mist or hig thin cloud coverage appeared to
blink on and die out. The larger planets often become temporarily
spectacular when they are low, near to the horizon and the weather
conditions are right.

#228a occurred at dusk, with the observers looking out
over the ocean. The nearly-full moon was fairly high in the
southeastern sky at that time; there might possibly be some
connection between it and the object observed, if weather condi-
tions were unusual.

It's a Kite? It's a Blimp?—What Is It??? Herald
                 /The (/Herald/0
Odd Phenomenon Seen In Sky

People are seeing odd things in Florida
skies again.

It's nothing so monotonous as flying
saucers or blazing meteors, though. This time
it’s a "burning planet" at South Bay, six!
“meteor” that looks like a "great, big kite"
at Riviera Beach.

Several persons at South Bay described
a Monday night sight that looked as if “one
of the larger planets was on fire with the
light blazing up and dying down.”

“Observed through field glasses, the phe-
nomenon was beautifully colored in reds, blues
and yellows," one witness said.

Several "enterprising spectators" then
looked at the thing through binoculars “They
reported it looked like a circle or halo or
surrounding a blazing star .

At Riviera Beach, several persons, in-
cluding a fireman and a special deputy, hap-
pened to be looking out over the ocean about
dusk Tuesday.

“We saw a strange flying object," they
reported. “It was alive color with a big
white spot on it. It was very rapid—making
was a long way off, but it looked to be about
20 feet across.

"It looked like a great, big kite,” they said.

It wouldn’t be a blimp, they decided. The
way it dodged, slid and speeded up was very
unblimplike.

The Miami Weather Bureau didn’t know
anything about it, and the Navy stated em-
phatically that it was not to blame for either
of the incidents.

TO Commanding General

ATTN: TCIAXO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MC1AXS,
dated 12 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first
indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation Of Uni-
dentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 15, "Direction
of Flight; of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that action is
specified as the direction towards which the objects appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Spotting" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.

Incldt.#229 -- South Bay, Florida -- 15 December 1948
#250 -- Riviera Beach, Florida -- 11 December 1948

There seem to be two separate observations reported in this incident, and the information given for each is entirely insufficient for adequate analysis.

In #229, the location of the object in the sky
given for its color of observation, the moon and Jupiter
visible in the early evening, its non quite high and western
setting, in the west. One might hazard a guess at Jupiter or
through a variable mist or high, thin clouds; someone is
blazed up and died out. The large planets often become momentarily 
conspicuous when they are very near the horizon and the weather 
conditions are right.

#250 occurred at dusk, with the observer's looking out
over the ocean. The Moon-Full moon was fairly high in the 
southern sky at this time; there might possibly by some 
confusion between it and the object observed, if weather conditions
were unusual.
