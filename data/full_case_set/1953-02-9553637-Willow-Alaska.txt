1. Between the approximate hours of 0945Z and 1005Z, 17 February 1953, an unidentified flying object was observed in the general area of Willow, Alaska (CORDSAR A 50 5445). The object, which appeared to be a small light, was sighted from a C-47 aircraft (AS 1012) by two rated pilots.

2. Investigation has revealed no airborne or weather balloons known to be in the area at that time, and identification has not been possible.

The image contains a photograph of a declassified document from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official program for investigating UFO sightings. The text in the document appears to describe a UFO sighting incident that occurred near Anchorage, Alaska, and includes details about the sighting.

Transcription of the text in the document:

INCIDENT NO. 7--ID UNIDENTIFIED LIGHT
Near Anchorage, Alaska—saw a red light that they pursued to the horizon. Pilots did the reporting. Distance: 15 miles. Duration: 1-2 minutes. Speed: In excess of 600 m.p.h. They stated the light was brighter than the brightest star and was seen at 10,000 feet altitude. The light appeared to be oval or round in shape and appeared to be under intelligent control as it made fast maneuvers and suddenly disappeared toward the northeast at a tremendous speed.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

CG 1029 AIR DIVISION (DEFENSE)  10AD-3-53       PAGE 2 OF 4 PAGES

Following is an account derived from an interview with Major Joseph J. Lemon:

At approximately 2330 (MST) 16 Feb 1953, a C-47, piloted by Major Joseph J. Lemon, navigator and crew of 6, was on an instrument-pilot training mission over the area of Anchorage, Alaska. As the aircraft approached an area approximately 25 miles southwest of Anchorage at an altitude of 12,000 feet, the pilot and the instructor-pilot, who was one of the passengers, observed a bright light approximately 5-6 miles distant, which was pulsating and moving in a zig-zag pattern at a speed estimated to be 1,000 to 1,500 miles per hour. The light was estimated to be approximately 7'5" in diameter. When it was realized that the object was speeding and maneuvering at a higher rate of speed than the C-47, the pilot took evasive action by going into a steep turn to the right. As the C-47 turned, the light was observed passing underneath the aircraft at an estimated distance of 2000 feet and the light was estimated to be at an altitude of about 10,000 feet. The light was observed for approximately 15 minutes and then disappeared.

The object continued on a straight course for the Willow area, slowly climbing to approximately 2000 feet, increasing its speed to twice its original size and intensity. On reaching the Willow area, the object seemed to stop and hover, then made a sharp turn to the northeast and disappeared to the northeast. The total time of sighting was approximately five minutes. It was above the horizon at that point.

The C-47 approached Elmendorf and entered the traffic pattern at 1500 feet on the upwind leg. Shortly after making the final turn onto the crosswind leg, the crew again observed the object standing still high in the sky. This time the object appeared much larger in size, approximately 7-8 miles in diameter. After the C-47 had taken up a landing of 330 degrees, the object was still visible in the northeast, continuing on a northerly course and gradually diminishing in size and intensity, disappeared. The C-47 landed safely at Elmendorf.

The duration of the sighting was approximately 15 minutes under CAVU weather conditions. Aurora Borealis illuminated the sky behind the object. The only conclusion the observers could make was that the object was a remote controlled device under the control of an intelligence. The size, speed, and maneuverability of the object were beyond the capability of any known aircraft, according to the observers.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
CG 10th Air Division (Defense) LOAD-3-53 PAGE 3 OF 4 SUBJECT
Following is an account derived from an interview with Captain Eugene B. Cramer, AD 316 247:
On 15 Feb 1953, at approximately 2345 hours (AST), a C-47, AF 1042, piloted by Major Joseph H. Lemon, AD 313 231, and carrying an instructor-pilot Captain Eugene B. Cramer, AD 316 247, was proceeding on an approach mission at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Anchorage, Alaska. At this time, as the C-47 was at an estimated altitude of 1100 feet, the crew noticed a brilliant light off to the right, which appeared to be in a stationary position. As this time the light appeared to be stationary and was observed to be a circular disk approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter. The light was observed to be in the stationary position for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Captain Cramer did not estimate the size of the object, but from his position in the aircraft it appeared to be approximately the same size as the running lights of the C-47.
Captain Cramer estimated its speed and altitude as being approximately 350 knots and between 1100 and 1200 feet. Inasmuch as the light now appeared as a constant red color and was about the size of the running lights of the C-47, the crew were able to maintain an accurate visual contact and observation. As the C-47 continued on course, the object appeared to commence a climbing maneuver at a considerable rate of speed with a definite red trail visible. This maneuver was accomplished in a very short period of time, and the object was observed to accelerate rapidly at a tremendous rate of speed until it disappeared from sight.
The face of the object remained luminous and did not appear to change regardless of its attitude or maneuvers. Captain Cramer contacted the Elmendorf tower to determine if any other aircraft had been observed in the area, but the tower answered in the negative to both questions. After requesting the interest of the operator, Captain Cramer was advised that no additional information were available for the mission.
Based on Captain Cramer's description, the object appeared to be moving in a manner which is inconsistent with conventional aircraft, possessing capabilities not known to be associated with any known type of aircraft. Taking into consideration the approximate 345 knot airspeed and altitude the object, the reported maneuvers and the rapidity of its departure, the object must be considered unidentified.
After circling for several minutes and no further observations of the object, the C-47 continued on its course. As they continued over Knik Arm on this course, the light seemed to be about 3 times as large as the running lights of the C-47. Its color also appeared to change from a brilliant red to about the color of a star. The light did not decrease in size or intensity until it disappeared at about 2500 feet.
From the time the flight was first observed until it disappeared was approximately between 2 and 3 minutes. It is estimated that the object was under observation for approximately 4 to 5 minutes.
After circling for several minutes and no further observations of the object, the C-47 returned to Elmendorf Air Force Base and landed.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
It is believed that the sources of this information are very reliable. Both officers reported to be reliable individuals, have had many years flying experience, and accurately observed and reported their observations. Neither had any preconceived notions concerning unidentified flying objects, and seemed to be completely objective in making their observations.

ALL INFORMATION AS TO THE SOURCE OF THIS LIGHT HAVE BEEN EXAMINED WITH NO IDENTIFICATION BEING MADE. APPARENTLY NO DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE STATEMENTS OF THE TWO OFFICERS. THE FIRST THAT THEY INITIALLY OBSERVED BY MAJOR LENSE APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES AFTER BEING FIRST SIGHTED BY CAPTAIN GRAUER, AND THAT THE OFFICERS WERE OBSERVED IN BRINGING THEIR AIRCRAFT INTO A STANDARD RATE TURN.
