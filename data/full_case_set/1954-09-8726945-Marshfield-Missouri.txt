MARSHFIELD, MISSOURI

On 18 & 19 Sept 22:00 Am on Sept. 22, 1954, myself, and my friend, who is both being the employees of Westover Gas Company in Marshfield, Missouri, were returning home from work.
We had completed a delivery. Approximately 3 miles east of Marshfield, Missouri on what is known as the Scout Camp Pond, we observed far to the west three clouds, or formations of silver objects. They were far enough away or so small that they appeared to be no more than a sliver, like to our eyes. Many of these objects were moving around, and the others seem to merely hover there. I stopped the truck to watch these objects and after about 2 minutes my partner noticed another object at what we guessed to be 500 feet high and about 200 yards 3/4. This object was somewhat like a boomerang in shape with the ex-tension clear across, one side or wing much longer, If the object was as close as we thought I would guess the entire width to be about 3 or 7 feet. This object was very thin in the wing section and the body as well. This object was silent. It appeared to be covered or made of some sort of plastic or very thin material. It revolved very slowly, the entire object revolved, and just before the one wing as it revolved and the wing came around near the sun it seemed to shine through or nearly through because of the thinness of the material, it would seem to be much lighter in color when the sun was hitting it.
The color was of a dark tan with 2 black stripes near the end of the wing or body. After the observed this object for a few minutes it banked a climb without changing its flight characteristics or without gaining any rpm or its wing. After rising so what we thought to 1000 feet or more it seemed to disappear.

There is no photograph present in the provided image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document containing text.

MARSHFIELD, MISSOURI.
Do about 1500 feet it then started to come down much slower than it had climbed as the climb took only about 20 seconds, after coming down to what we thought about 500 feet it changed its revolving action in that it started tumbling but not any faster than it had revolved. After falling a short distance in this position it emitted a series of white smoke or vapor this was not in a trailing form but just one big puff of smoke or vapor, as this time or any other time did we ever hear any noise, after omitting this smoke or vapor it stopped all motion and fell straight into a small patch of timber. We did not actually see this object hit the ground because of the rough terrain but we did see it go behind the timber line. We then left out truck and went into the woods to see if we could find any other trace of this object. After some minutes we found two places in the grass completely pulverised but did'nt show any sign of an animal track, this might or might not of had any thing to do with it but it did seem strange in which act did seem like that of an animal or human had made it that it did not leave any track.
When we first noticed this object it seemed to hover at about the 800 feet level. The wing or rotor was slightly curved upward at the tip and near the two dark stripes. When this object stopped it gradually started to call the whole mass was noticed up its directing the base of this wing under would be the bottom was the heaviest part. At no time was there a glow about involved in any fashion. While falling it did not flutter or spin at all but fell straight down to the ground line. Before falling past the timber line we watched this object fall.

OBJECT FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. AFTER THE TWO OF US STOPPED THE AREA VERY THOROUGHLY WE RETURNED TO MARSHFIELD, MISSOURI. I CALLED THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND ALSO CALLED CAPT. G. E. HARTMAN ABOUT THE OBJECT. HE SAID FOUR MEN TO MARSHFIELD, MISSOURI WHERE THEY PICKED THE TWO OF US UP AND WE RETURNED TO THE AREA AND MADE A MORE THOROUGH SEARCH AND OF A MUCH WIDER AREA BUT WITHOUT FINDING ANY MORE TRACE OF THIS OBJECT THAT WE HAD FOUND BEFORE. IT ABOUT 9.30 P.M. TWO U.P. RAILROAD DETECTIVES ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND AFTER EXAMINING THE AREA AND MAKING A SEARCH OF THEIR OWN, ALSO FAILED TO FIND ANYTHING AT ALL OTHER THAN THE TWO PLACES IN THE EARTH THAT WAS TORN UP. AFTER LEAVING THE TRUCK IN THE BEGINNING TO START THE FIRST SEARCH, MR. ISH AND MYSELF DID NOT SEE THE SILVER OBJECT AGAIN THAT FIRST ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION. THE TWO OF US HAD TIME TO STUDY THE OBJECT AND IT IS JUST AS I HAVE DESCRIBED.

We were just passing through, noticing the craft in the sky. The motion of the craft seemed very irregular, changing directions and darting about strangely. We stopped to observe it for a few minutes before it disappeared.

The image on the page contains three sketches or illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the path of an object that was above the horizon when first observed, and the viewer's perspective of how high the object was above the horizon. The second and third sketches appear to be different views or perspectives of a similar object or scene, with one sketch showing a larger, more detailed view and the other showing a smaller, more simplified view.

32. In the following sketch show how the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The image does not contain any visible photographs or images. It appears to be a typed document containing text describing an incident related to a "RADAR MAINTENANCE, 727TH ACAW SQUADRON, FORD LAND, MISSOURI, APPROXIMATELY 21525 HOURS ZULU".

The text describes the dispatch of five airmen to a site where a patch of ground was found to be "literally pulverized" with "dirt agitated on surface" and "rocks, small in size, were disturbed in this spot". The document also mentions an object seen in the sky that appeared to be "death by something nearly following" but was undisturbed with no signs of burning, scouting, or breakage. The document concludes by describing the object as an "intelligent young man" who appears to have a "factual" story.
