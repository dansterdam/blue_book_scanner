PRELIMINARY INFORMATION CONCERNING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT INCIDENT AT CASTLE ROCK, COLORADO, JUNE 6, 1966

1. On 7 June 1966, this office was notified by telephone of an unidentified flying object incident which had occurred on the previous day at Castle Rock, Colorado. A summary of the preliminary information received is as follows:

2. On 6 June 1966, at approximately 0230 hours, MDT, two civilian security officers employed by the Public Service Company of Colorado were on routine patrol duty at the Castle Rock Substation in Castle Rock, Colorado. While patrolling the perimeter of the substation, they observed a bright light in the sky to the southwest. They stopped their vehicle to observe the light, which appeared to be stationary. Within a few minutes, the light began to move in a southwest direction at a high rate of speed, then stopped. The light then began to oscillate, moving slowly back and forth, up and down. After several minutes, the light suddenly accelerated in a northeast direction at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view.

3. The two security officers reported that the light was oval in shape, white in color, and bright enough to illuminate the area around them. They estimated the size of the light to be approximately 20-25 feet in diameter. No sound was heard associated with the object.

4. The security officers immediately reported the incident to their supervisor, who in turn notified the appropriate authorities.
