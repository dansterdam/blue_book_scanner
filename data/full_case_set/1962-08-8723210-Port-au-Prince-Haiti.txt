OCR text output:

The object was sighted slightly northwest of the town at an estimated altitude of 1,500 to 2,000 feet. It was oval in shape, about 50 feet in diameter, and had a bright, metallic appearance. The object was observed for about 3 minutes and then disappeared to the northeast at a high rate of speed.

The color of the object was shiny, silver-gray. It could be observed against a clear sky and produced no sound. The object appeared to be hovering and made no maneuvers during the observation.

The witness stated the object gathered speed with such acceleration that it vanished from sight within a second or two. The observer was unable to estimate its speed, but stated it was extremely fast. No trails or exhaust were observed. The object seemed to just disappear.

FRIDAY, AUGUST 8, 1962
PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI
AT APPROXIMATELY 2315 HOURS, LOCAL TIME, A RESIDENT OF PORT-AU-PRINCE REPORTED OBSERVING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN THE NIGHT SKY OVER PORT-AU-PRINCE.
THE WITNESS DESCRIBED THE OBJECT AS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, APPROXIMATELY 75 FEET IN DIAMETER, AND EMITTING A BRIGHT LIGHT FROM ITS UNDERSIDE. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN TO HOVER IN THE SKY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE RAPIDLY ACCELERATING AND DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW.
NO OTHER WITNESSES WERE REPORTED, AND NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WAS RECOVERED. THE CASE WAS CLASSIFIED AS UNRESOLVED BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK.

UFO SIGHTING, PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI

OSD, ISA (Capt Neill)
CASE 23 DC

This letter contains information regarding an unidentified flying object sighting which occurred in the area of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on 30 August 1962. The report is forwarded for your information.

In this sighting, the object was the planet Venus in the sky. The reported size of the object was approximately 2-3 times the size of a basketball or about 2 degrees in diameter. The duration of the sighting was 24 minutes 59 seconds. This location of the object would have caused it to be quite low on the horizon, approximately 10 minutes without moving.

The informant reported his belief that it was necessary to move the object by mechanical means. The apparent angular rate of motion of the object was approximately 1/3 of a degree per minute. This rate of motion is not unusual and could be accounted for by the normal apparent motion of a celestial object due to the rotation of the earth. The time required for the object to traverse the 2 degree diameter field of view was approximately 6 minutes.

The optical equipment used by the observer was not specified. However, the apparent size and motion of the object are consistent with an observation of the planet Venus under the stated conditions. No other unusual characteristics were reported.

OFFICIAL FILE COPY
5. At the time of the sighting the bright star alpha virgo (Spica), magnitude 1.0, was only approximately one-half degree from the planet Venus at the same apparent magnitude 3.4. They were both on the horizon and could not be positively distinguished from each other due to atmospheric conditions which was a contributing factor.
6. Venus at the time of the sighting had a magnitude of -3.9. The observer stated that no more than 10 to 15 minutes earlier at 13:34 he had viewed from the warth-nll station Venus as a brilliant star approximately 30 degrees elevation with the unaided eye, and that as time went on it seemed to diminish in brightness. This apparent distortion could have been an atmospheric effect.
7. It is concluded that the misidentification of the planet Venus was probably the major factor contributing to this report. The apparent nearness of the star-like object to the planet Venus, the similarity in magnitude and other atmospheric conditions were probably major contributing factors.

UNITED STATES AIR FORCE MISSION TO HAITI (CAIRO)
c/o AMERICAN EMBASSY
PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI
20 September 1962

(1) During the period 16-17 August 1962, a U.S. Air Force team visited the area of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to investigate a reported sighting of an unidentified flying object.

(2) According to information received, the incident occurred at approximately 2000-2200 on 7 August 1962, the witnesses being a local resident and several members of the U.S. Embassy staff.

(3) Description of incident:
(a) Some lights were observed descending from the sky and approaching the witnesses. These lights were described as bright, pulsating, and maneuvering.
(b) As the lights approached, the gassy smell of the atmosphere was detected, and the surrounding area was illuminated, although the source of light was not clearly seen.
(c) The color was said to be a silvery-gray.

(4) The officers:
(a) The sighting was considered to be of some significance.
(b) There was no physical evidence of the incident.
(c) No sound was heard.
(d) The object was estimated to be the size of a small automobile.
(e) The duration of the sighting was approximately 5 to 10 minutes.
(f) There was a cloud or haze surrounding the object, probably indicating some type of field or disturbance of the atmosphere.
(g) The object was observed to descend and then accelerate rapidly and disappear from sight.
(h) No count was evident at any time.
(i) None.

(5) Conclusion of course of current:
(a) The object observed may have been of an extraterrestrial nature.
(b) The characteristics observed are similar to those reported in other sightings.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, containing only text.

The text found in the document is as follows:

(1) The object was described as
(2) The object manoeuvred in such a way as to cause the witness to believe there were actually two objects involved in the observation. (See Power report on attached sheets)
(3) This object manoeuvred in a very erratic manner, moving from side to side and up and down. It did not seem to be a conventional aircraft.
(4) The object was observed for perhaps over 2 minutes.
(5) Manoeuvres were recorded.
(6) Evaluation was inconclusive.
(7) Manoeuvres considered unusual.
(8) Haze-like object showing definite speed and manoeuvres.
(9) Observed by two independent witnesses, together.
(10) Profile outline changed in apparent shape periodically.
(11) I would not classify as aircraft, conventional or otherwise, based on reported behaviour.
(12) Could not remain stable but did not follow random course.
(13) I would not designate as astral phenomena, but cannot identi-fy.
(14) Unusual case, in which the sighting by two credible independent witnesses raises considerable uncertainty as to identity of the observed object. A substantial case which does not readily resolve into any conventional explanation.
