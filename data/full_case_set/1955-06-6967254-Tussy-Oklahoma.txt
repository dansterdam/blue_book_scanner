The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically the UFOB Index Card for an incident that occurred in Tussy, Oklahoma on June 25, 1955.

The text in the document states:

1. DATE: 25 June 1955
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2541302 June 1955
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. SOURCE: Civilian
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Five (5) Seconds
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One (1) 
9. COURSE: ESE
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: One (1) round object, the size of the moon with a fuzzy outline appeared thru the windshield of the observers' car. It was visible for a period of five (5) seconds and then faded. The object seemed to have a change of size during the observation as though related to a flight path. The course of the object was a level flight path to the ESE.
12. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the delay in transmittal of the report it is impossible to investigate this sighting. A check of maps and radio teletype tapes failed to reveal any unusual activity in the area at the time of the sighting. The inability to interview the observers and the lack of physical evidence would tend to eliminate the possibility of a scientific identification. In the opinion of this office the sighting was generated by astronomical activity, possibly the moon.
