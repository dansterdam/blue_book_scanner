UFO Investigation Unit
Air Force Base, Maryland

Dear Sir:

I wish to report that at approximately 2:10 this morning I observed an extremely unusual object flying through the sky. It appeared to be hovering and then suddenly disappeared. The object was round in shape and silvery in appearance. It hovered at a very high altitude and was not an aircraft of any kind that I am familiar with. The object did not seem to make any sound and there were no lights visible on it. I would be very interested to know if any other reports of this nature have been made in this area.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr.:
Reference is your recent unidentified observation of 25 April 1966. The information which we have received is indicates that you observed a trail of some sort in the sky. Since we do not have the details of your observation in the envelope provided. Since this is a possible meteor observation, we would appreciate it if you could furnish us with two prints to go with the information you have provided. This will enable us to compare the observation with records maintained by the American Meteor Society.

Your report indicates that you took photographs of the trail. We would like to borrow the original negative for evaluation. We would return the negative with two prints to you upon completion of our analysis.

We wish to thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr, Major, USAF

Redditt Vanderbilt is 
Mr. Vanderbilt called in at 3:30 p.m. and described a sighting that occurred 
at approximately 3:15 p.m. today in Redditt, Onondaga County, N.Y. 

Mr. Vanderbilt saw an object that appeared to be 30 to 40 feet in diameter. He 
said the object was silver in color and appeared to hover over a small hill about 
a mile from his location. It remained in view for about 2 or 3 minutes and then 
accelerated and disappeared from sight. He said it made no sound.  

Mr. Vanderbilt was very upset and concerned. He felt the object could not have 
been a conventional aircraft. He wanted to report the sighting to the proper 
authorities.

1700 hrs  13 May 1966
Malden, Massachusetts
Two unidentified flying objects were first observed by a number of witnesses between the hours of 1700 and 1745, and then at about 1800.20:00 hours? unidentified flying object. The object was described as being bright and circular, apparently about 25-30 feet in diameter. It was observed to be hovering, and then to move away very rapidly to the south.
First all calls were taken and recorded at the time. An emergency scramble of jet aircraft from Otis AFB near Hyannis was ordered by the ADC command. As determined from the tape recordings, these calls were received from many persons, both civilian and military, reporting the sighting of the unidentified flying object. These various observers gave detailed information as to what they had seen. It also appears that there were telephone calls to Hanscom Field concerning the sighting.
By the time I was able to contact Col Moore, who was in command of the ADC detachment at Otis AFB, the jets were already airborne. He informed me that they had chased the object but had been unable to intercept it, as it had moved away at a very high rate of speed. He stated that the pilots had obtained a visual sighting of the object and that, at one point, it had hovered for a period of time before suddenly accelerating and moving out of sight. At the same time, it was picked up on radar. I was informed that the object did not remain in the area long, but left rapidly in a southerly direction.
I would state that an official information release has been made, and that all telephone calls and reports have been carefully recorded. This is merely a brief summary of the highlights of this sighting, and the official files should be consulted for complete details.

SECTION IV
1. GENERAL
The object described in this sighting report was observed on April 7, 1966 at approximately 1930 hours by Mrs. Barbara Mader, Waukesha, Wisconsin. Mrs. Mader reported that she was looking out the window of her residence toward the northwest when she observed a bright light in the sky. The light was observed for a period of approximately 5 minutes.
2. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT
Mrs. Mader described the object as a bright light approximately the size of a small star, which appeared to be stationary in the sky. There were no other distinguishing characteristics reported.
3. COURSE OF OBJECT
The object was observed to remain stationary for the entire period it was in view.
4. OPINIONS
Mrs. Mader felt that the object was possibly an aircraft, satellite, or meteor. The Air Force evaluation of this sighting is that it was most likely the planet Venus, which was bright in the evening sky at the time of the sighting.

Commander
Attn: Capt. George C. Price, Jr.
Dayton 23, Ohio

Dear Sir:

I am writing to tell you about an incident that occurred about 7:50 -8:00 P.M. on April 2, 1966.
A friend and I were in a car, one of the other passengers observing. The object first appeared to the Northwest, coming from the direction of Vermont, moving rapidly and descending in altitude. It appeared to be circular, somewhat larger than the full moon, and brilliantly illuminated, with a pale blue-green color. The light was not diffused but seemed to emanate from the object itself, casting a faint glow on the surrounding clouds and terrain. The object moved rapidly, in a straight course, and then made an abrupt turn to the west and continued on toward the Adirondack Mountains area of New York State. The object was in sight for approximately 2-3 minutes. I cannot say with certainty whether or not there was any sound associated with it. 
This is a brief account of the incident as I observed it. I would be most interested in any further information you may have regarding similar sightings or your opinion as to the nature of this object.

Yours very truly,
[signature redacted]

Text from the document:

To: HQ03 Headquarters Squadron, S.C.P.S.I.S., U.S.A.F.
Subject: UFO sightings of 25April 66
Dear Sirs:
The following is a report of two sightings of objects in the sky on the night of 25 April 66. Witnesses in both cases were two civilians, Gould, and Byers, who were driving an automobile approximately eight miles south of Kingston, N.Y. between 9:45 and 10:00 p.m.
At approximately 9:10 - 9:15 p.m. a flickering light drew the attention of the two witnesses to the sky. This light seemed to be moving at a high altitude from the S.S.W. in a direct line. The light was of a pulsating nature, blue-green in color and appeared to be the size of the mass of the moon. Because of its flickering nature, it was difficult to estimate the size. It was estimated by height and size that the object was several thousand feet in altitude and approximately 300 to 400 feet in diameter. The object continued on a straight course and disappeared beyond the horizon but did burn out completely.
This sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds. It was not until the second sighting that we near what could be described as a vehiclecontrol intervention. The object in the second sighting was also observed to come in over the trees from the S.S.W. and proceeded in a northerly direction at an estimated altitude of 500 to 1000 feet. This second object was described as a solid bluish-white light that seemed to be spinning or turning. The object was very bright and caused "pins and needles" sensation in the eyes of the observers when they looked directly at it. The object descended to approximately 50 to 100 feet above the treetops and then accelerated at a very high rate of speed, climbing quickly out of sight. This sighting lasted for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Both witnesses were greatly impressed by what they had observed and felt certain that a technical evaluation of their sighting would be of interest to your office.

- page 31 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document with text describing the details of a UFO sighting.

Description of the vehicle was oval, looking much like the full moon, but brightly illuminated over its entire surface with a bluish-green color. It seems to have been at a considerable distance from the observer since we learned that those who made the first sightings from their closed window could not see detail. It is evident from the press release that the second sighting was observed by the exception.

I might also add that I have just completed four years as an Investigator in this project and had the opportunity to interview a large number of people who have witnessed unusual aerial phenomena. It is my feeling that proper channels for future reference.

Thank you.
Very truly

The Great Bolide of April 25, 1966

CHARLES F. OLIVIER, Director, American Meteor Society

On the above date, at 7:14 p.m. Eastern standard time, a very brilliant meteor was observed traversing the skies over a wide area of the Northeastern United States, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. This bolide showed the moon, giving a good position of the horizon and the general direction of motion. The bolide showed up very well against the twilight sky, and was visible for a rather long time, perhaps 10 to 15 seconds, as it moved slowly. It finally broke into fragments and disappeared.

Immediate steps were taken to collect all available data on this event. Numerous reports were received from observers in the area, and a number of these were published in the Washington Evening Star, which then stimulated further reports. These reports, as well as some unpublished material, have been assembled, and the results are presented in this article, while the Flower and Cook Observatory data are included in the table below.

The time of the event, as determined from the various accounts used in this article, was 7:14 p.m., Eastern standard time, or 0014 Universal Time. The bolide was seen by a large number, as did the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP).

In all, about 500 reports were assembled, containing very valuable information on the motion, brightness, duration, color, and other features of this bolide. However, as is usually the case, enough data were not collected to permit a complete analysis and calculation of the orbit, because of the lack of accurate attitudes and azimuths from the observers. But the general direction and path of this bolide can be determined with a fair degree of accuracy.

The principal features of the bolide, as determined from the data collected, are:

but minutes of are were retained in this work, and final results were rounded off to the nearest tenth. The deseending angles and distances to the path were determined at different intervals of the object's descent, most of its path, but a few reported a change of direction in the vicinity of the object, some observers also mentioned differences in distance to the path and in angular size, apparently corresponding to changes in the object's apparent size.
Many observers compared the angular diameter of the object with the apparent diameter of celestial objects' the comparison is difficult, but measures of angular diameter were obtained from three photographs by Veronica Johnson of Westbury, New York, which cover the descent of the object as seen from the Rockland County Police Department June, 1966, cover shows fully a dozen different sets of measurements, indicating the difficulty of distant observers in noting the details of an object's size and shape.
The descent was studied at Drs. Smith Observatory, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on the same evening by a team directed by D. B. Spencer (Gettysburg, Pennsylvania), but it developed bumps that made the interpretation and precision more difficult. 
T. D. Nicholson (Woodchuck Lane, New Jersey) observed the path, but the observed angular velocity was slow and the height was estimated to be 10" above the terrain, but appeared to be influenced by buildings and terrain, and it was difficult to determine the exact height and path.
The angular velocities determined in three cases were calculated for the observed in place around the sun of 1 1/4 minutes of arc.

200 to 300 miles coming down what is very really calls the "New York express".
Neither did John F. McIlale, manager of the Penn, Ohio, station have an idea what it was going to do about this, explaining that "It come in like a big flash."

Two Air Force reservists spotting the object said it look like a "very steady, flat trajectory."
Police investigations were also made on this the same night.

At Utica, police said they had a "pretty steady" 8 mile sighting.
John Celasari, vice-chairman of the Broom County, Astronomers, said the object exploded "like a rocket, caused with a loud noise, separating into two". Most of the object was over Binghamton and Endicott, about 12 to 15 miles from Binghamton.

The Associated Press said it was Berea, Ill. a suburb of Chicago, when the object first came into sight.
In Utica, the first caller, said they thought it was a plane on fire over Rome, N.Y.
Glens Falk police received 13 calls in 10 minutes.
A Gleason aircraft executive, who was on the observation platform of the Binghamton television station when he spotted "a green object, very bright", said the flash "was so bright it almost blotted out the sky for about a quarter of a mile in diameter."
Montgomery County Deputy Sheriff, H. N. Wood, reported that he was "awakened from a sound sleep in his living room window - a fantastic sight."

The Associated Press said it was about a quarter second time in duration the flash was seen to have occurred over a distance of 200 to 300 miles.
Dr. Asher Chapman, an examiner of the U.S. A. field for the U.S. Air Force stated that the object was "150 feet long, traveling about 1,000 feet per second, about 20,000 feet from the ground four miles from south to north."
Assistant Professor Anthony L. Jenzano, director of the Penn State University Planetarium, said that the object was in the sky and everyone is speculating that it is U.F.O.
Dr. Curtis Hemenway, director of the Cornell University Observatory, said that most observers saw as bright ball more as a "brilliant ball - bright balls" that burst off sparks before it was distinguished "probably was little more than a meteor".

The image is accompanied by a newspaper article titled "Young Utican's $8 Camera Finds 'Something in the Sky' on Film" which discusses the sighting of a fireball by a Utica, New York resident.

Thousands See Fireball
Young Utican's $8 Camera Finds 'Something in the Sky' on Film
By GARY STRANGES
Sometime last night, what with his $8 camera,a Utica freshman took a picture of a fireball in the sky. The youngster, whose identity has not been divulged, says he was shooting pictures of friends when something caught his eye. He snapped a picture - and the film showed something in the sky. 
The picture appeared in today's O-D to the National Investigation Commission (NICAP) and the Air Force. NICAP, a private research group, says the object appears to be a UFO. But some officials say it could be a known astronomical phenomenon and nothing more.
The youth, a student at Utica College, spotted the object at about 8:20 p.m. April 25. A friend with him also saw the brilliant object. They compared notes later and agreed it was not an airplane.
The photo that came out, which has been reproduced nationally by The Associated Press, shows a bright, elongated object in the sky. NICAP says the picture is interesting and shows a bright object that might be a UFO, but without further evidence, there's not enough to identify the object.
The Air Force, which has been inundated with reports of the sighting, told the Observer-Dispatch that the object might have been a meteor, or something atmospheric. But they are interested in the photo and plan to investigate further.
If all this sounds familiar, it's because Dana DeCoursey, 15, of Proctor High School, had a similar experience two weeks earlier. Dana's family released a fireball photo taken by the youth. The Air Force said the object was a meteor and the case was closed. 
Dana's father, Carlton DeCoursey, said last night the new picture taken in Utica is similar to his son's and indicates "there's more going on than anyone realizes."

"BUT I'M NOT QUALIFIED." Dana admitted, "I'M MORE INCLINED to think it was a UFO sighting." 
ALL STARTED last night when Dana, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Lacktis, pointed to a light in the sky. 
Both boys want to be astronomers and have geared their curiosity toward the sky.
"Dana, look over there," Vincent recalled telling Dana, "I've seen that before,"
Dana responded, "There's a light over there high as to be 10 miles above the earth. A part of it came down like a parachute,"
It seemed like it was burning and traveling pretty fast, faster than the speed of sound. It headed toward the earth, Dana said.
SCIENTISTS, Air Force spokesmen and others explained the thousands of flooded police and newspaper switchboards resulted from the fact that this was the most widely seen UFO incident in recent years.
The thousands of flooded police and newspaper switchboards resulted from the fact that this was the most widely seen UFO incident in recent years.
The object was sighted over a wide area and observers are certain that it was not an experimental aircraft or satellite. The object changed in appearance as it was observed and was seen by numerous witnesses.
A 1952 report estimated that 500 million Americans have sighted what they believe were UFOs. Most of these sightings, however, could be explained as known aircraft or celestial phenomena.
The Air Force listed the object as a "probable satellite" and therefore a lot of people saw it.
STORY: REPORTS said the object turned from white to bright as it passed over the area.

Sparkler in the sky called meteor

"It was just gorgeous," said Miss Esther L. Schilling, a Canandaigua, N.Y., witness. "It looked like a huge sparkler across the sky."

This was just one of scores of calls that flooded The Herald-Journal switchboard Sunday at 6:15 and 6:30 last night. The bright, burning object was spotted in the sky over much of central New York and northeastern Pennsylvania.

Observatory officials who witnessed the dazzling celestial phenomenon which luminously streaked across the evening sky, termed it a bolide, or fire-ball meteor.

The officials said it was probably a large piece of burning meteoric material that broke off from a larger mass and traveled swiftly to earth.

Reports were received from as far apart as the Carolinas to Canada and as far away as Niagara Falls on the north and near Pittsburgh on the west. Most of the sightings were in a northwesterly path with a peak around 6:20 p.m.

Aviation observers were deluged with inquiries from persons seeking to determine if the object was a secret Air Force rocket or some such man-made device shooting through the heavens.

Air Force spokesmen assigned to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base denied any knowledge of such a flight and termed speculation on such as being unreasonable. Lt. Col. William M. Johnson, chief of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's nationwide satellite tracking network, said the flash apparently was not a satellite or other man-made object traveling in space.

One woman, described as an amateur astronomer, said the flash was as bright as a welder's torch and lasted about five seconds. Raymond W. Groff said he witnessed the object while traveling from south to north and described it as "a big ball of fire with a very long tail."

Frank Weekley, both of Lyons, N.Y., and a Mr. Kline watching from Geneva, N.Y., also reported seeing the spectacular "fiery object" streak across the sky.

"We' re now glad to say that we could not tell" said Swigert in a report from the Pittsburgh communications center he had called for information.
The caller was a man who said he had received fifty calls, all within a few minutes, from people who had seen a strange light in the sky that they couldn't tell what it was.
"Rather than get our operators all excited, we concluded it wasn't anything important they had seen," said Swigert.
Mr. Snyryer, a licensed pilot who said he had been making many sightings, said the light was "just like a meteor, nothing else."
"But I never see anything like that. It was a brilliant light on the horizon. It was visible for several seconds and then it disappeared," said Mr. Snyryer.

The image appears to contain a newspaper article with the headline "Fiery Ball Seen In Utica Skies". The article describes an observation of a "fiery ball" or "called meteorite" by several people in Utica, New York on the evening of April 26, 1966. The article interviews various witnesses, including a high school student, a university observatory official, and an Air Force spokesman, who provide details about the sighting and attempt to analyze or explain the phenomenon. No additional photograph is present in the image.

CALLED METEORITE
Utica, N. Y. Apr. 26 (AP) - A fiery ball which zoomed through the sky over Utica on Tuesday night was described as a "called meteorite" by federal aviation authorities today.
The object was seen by Marianne, the cashier at the Utica Daily Press, and others at 9:05 p.m. It was described as a "reddish-blue ball and reddish-orange in color." The object lasted for 25 seconds.
Jeffrey Crover, 14-year-old son of Mrs. Betty Crover of West Drive, who with his parents saw the object, said "it went straight across the sky, then it began to go downward."
DeGeorge, who was with friend, described the object as "reddish-orange and extremely bright, much brighter than any star."
The Rev. Richard P. Wheatley, chairman of the Hayden Planetarium, said the firehall was an "exceptionally bright meteor, many times brighter than the sky's brightest star."
If would continue the luminous trail which would mean it was at least 100 miles high, he said. 
A spokesmen at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington said it was an "exceptionally bright meteor" and the observatory confirmed the sighting.
The director of the University Observatory said the object could have been space debris which got heated up when it entered the atmosphere and therefore burns itself out as it descends.
A reliable source is travel at a level attitude, he said. But the small console control would indicate the size is not large, the object was several times brighter than all other recent UFO sightings.
A. Griffing, Air Force, spokesman, said it was definitely not a satellite, nor any known aircraft entering the atmosphere and burning up as it did. It could not have been produced by natural causes, he added.

He turned to the student and said: "The fact is there has been no scientific data to verify stories that there exist phenomena not understood by the public."

Flames are for the continued building which pulled up - and UFO publicity and brought desire for recounting experiences. Flying saucers are a

Flying Saucers? No

Prof. Smiley Doubts The Eerie Stories

By GEORGE POPKIN

'Scattered flying saucers reported over the earth as 'Dr. Constant H. Smiley, associate University astronomer kept shaking his vigorous head at our time.'

'Namely, the theory that intelligent life from outer space is stopping about our planet to observe its inhabitants and their activities."

"For a period and excited man, chief scientist at North American Aviation, set in motion what he sees are delusions.

"A student told him in class that he had sighted a flying saucer over Riverside." 

"Since the student had been unable to gain admittance to Smiley's observatory, He concluded, "as a scientist," that the student, and others like him, might have seen some unusual thing in the sky.

"Said Professor Smiley, 'I do not have a very small mind as that would indicate.

"I have met from time to time. It was very bright that night, and low over the horizon. But it was a record center. It turned out there were some nearby. What he had seen was a haze being used in an experiment. It is part of our scientific investigation here."

"Whether the visitor spoke English. When she related this was his assessment; 'it cannot be so.'"

"If it was part of a meteor, it would be moving in another direction," he said. "The motion might have cracked the atmosphere. It is very common for people to think a meteor falls a long way off, but this one was very close."

YOU OIS
UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT OBSERVED IN SKY OVER WEST SPRINGPIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, APRIL 7, 1966.

At approximately 2300 local time on April 7, 1966, an unidentified object was observed in the sky over West Springfield, Massachusetts, by a group of four persons.

The following is a summary of the incident as reported in the official project Blue Book file:

The object was observed by four residents of West Springfield, Massachusetts, for a period of approximately 45 minutes, from about 2300 to 2345 local time on April 7, 1966.

The witnesses described the object as a round, glowing mass of light, approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The object was stationary at first, then began to move slowly, stopping and starting at irregular intervals. The object did not appear to have any lights, windows, or other distinguishing features. At times it appeared to change color from yellow to white to blue-green. The object was at an estimated altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. No sound was heard associated with the object.

The witnesses included a married couple, their daughter, and a neighbor. All four persons independently reported the sighting and provided similar descriptions of the object. The Air Force investigator concluded that the object was a genuine unidentified flying object (UFO) and could not be explained by any conventional aircraft or other known object.

only be described as almost a form of new matter.
But these incidents are of a more serious nature. He said the 
saucer was seen by more than one observer at a time, and was mott-
ing rapidly, and his eyes began to smart and then burn from the 
blue-white light. It produced vertigo, nausea, and severe shaking. 
There were also two great many of the flying saucers reported in 
this area during the past year, more than in other parts of the coun-
try, he said. "We believe it is more than just devils chasing

Several persons in the Central Islip area of Long Island also reported seeing the UFO early Sunday evening.
Gordon Angus B-B-B airport manager, said he was flying an airplane over Bayshore, L.I., N.Y. and witnessed the object.
Four young boys, fishing in the Mastic area, also reported seeing the object which "stopped suddenly and streaked off."
Danny Emerson, Edward and Michael P. Martin and Joe Conter, all residents of Centereach, told authorities they observed the strange object.
David Ridley, of 330 Carlin St., Central Islip, L.I., said he and his family were in their backyard when the object appeared overhead.
Carlin said it was a brilliant light that seemed to be about size of a baseball and was blue-green in color. It suddenly shot off the ground.

A bright green light in the sky was sighted near Utica, N.Y. on April 7, according to members of the northeastern Utica Air Force Base said after checking switchboards on the celestial.

People in the Utica and Rome, N.Y. areas reported the object. It was described as "a bright green light, like a silvery ball, with red and green flames as late as 9:38 p.m.

LEROY SEAMAN of 3 Park St, Utica, N.Y. told police he had watched the object for about 20 minutes shortly after 9 p.m. when "a bright green light, like a large star suddenly appeared in the sky and disappeared. It was at an angle about 45 to 50 degrees in the southwest horizon."

William G. White of Rome, N.Y. and James Bossick of Utica, N.Y. reported they saw the object between 8:45 and 9:30 p.m.

However, Dana DiCerge, 201 Sangertown Rd., New Hartford, N.Y. said they spotted "a rotating white light, moving from the northeast to southwest and hanging from red to white to green" at about 8:30 p.m.

JULES ABBOTT of Maynard, N.Y. told Herkimer County police the object appeared to be disc-shaped, rapidly changing colors from red, white and green.

Sighting reports after 9 p.m. also came from Oneida and Chenango counties.

CURTIS L. HEMENARY, director of the Putnam Observatory, said the descriptions led him to believe it was "a very slow meteorite" without a tail. However, he added, "if it were a meteorite, I don't see why it would be seen for such a long time."

Another spokesman at the observatory said it was probably a "satellite." He said satellites have given the same impression in the past.

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, and it does not contain any photographs. The text on the page describes an incident where thousands of people in the Northeastern United States reportedly saw what they believed to be a meteor or a possible satellite, which prompted numerous calls to the local authorities and generated significant public interest and media coverage. The report discusses various details and accounts related to this incident, including the observations made by witnesses, the responses from local officials, and the scientific speculation around the nature of the observed object.

Thousands See Meteor's Flight; Authorities Besieged With Calls
Numerous witnesses in Northeastern U.S., the Police station, press and radio have reported the sighting of a bright luminous object streaking across the sky. The object was observed generally to the north and east and was described as a bright greenish-white, brilliantly luminous object, possibly a meteor or a satellite, which has been the source of hundreds of telephone calls to the police, sheriff's office and other civil authorities in the area.
The Utica Police Department reported numerous sightings, and the Sheriff's Department said that Dr. Thomas A. Nicholson, director of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, said that the object was "undoubtedly a meteor" and that it was a multi-colored slow-moving luminous object. 
The object reportedly changed color several times and it left a bright trail behind it. Hundreds of people in several communities were reported to have witnessed the object, and many were said to be "astounded viewers." 
There was no clear agreement on the size, shape or altitude of the object. Some callers described it as being as large as a house, while others said it was no larger than an automobile. Reports said the object was so bright that it illuminated the landscape. 
The object prompted hundreds of phone calls to local police stations and news media offices. At Plattsburgh Air Force Base, a spokesman said the object was difficult to identify, and added that "if one was flying that fast, it sure would be in trouble."

The image contains a photograph of a bright light streaking across the sky, as described in the text. The text underneath the photograph states that the photograph was taken by George Gambiino, a cameraman for Station WWLP-TV in Springfield, Massachusetts, who spotted a brilliant light streaking between the buildings of downtown Springfield and captured these images as the object, which the text describes as resembling a "fiery sphere" with a "twisted tail," appeared to flicker and disintegrate into beams of light.

SPRINGFIELD, MASS.
George Gambiino, a cameraman for Station WWLP-TV, was returning from an assignment when he spotted a brilliant light streaking between the buildings of downtown Springfield and shot these pictures. First evidence of the meteor looked like a fiery sphere with a twisted tail a few seconds later (right) it appeared to flicker and disintegrate into beams of light. Springfield, like New York City, lies east of the meteor's path, hence the meteor seemed to move left to right across the heavens.

The image appears to contain a black and white photograph of a meteor in full view, as indicated by the title "A Meteor in Full View". The photograph shows a bright object streaking across the sky, against a dark background.

NEW YORK CITY
Thousands of people across the northeastern U.S. were dazzled last week by a spectacularly bright object—which most authorities described as a meteor—seen at sunset along a 1,000-mile path from the Carolinas to Canada. In New York 19-year-old William Copeland, a college freshman and an amateur photographer, was prowling along the Brooklyn waterfront and caught the luminous meteor plummeting toward earth, its silvery trail etched against the orange sky over lower Manhattan.
