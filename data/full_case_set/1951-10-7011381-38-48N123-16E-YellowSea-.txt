AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (Location): ATIL Office, D/I 2SAF REPORT NO.: FR-27-52
DATE: 13 October 1952  PAGE NO.: 1
SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UFO OVER YELLOW SEA
SUMMARY: On 7 October 1952 at 2300Z, AF personnel at ATIL observed a bright object in the sky. The object, saucer-shaped, was observed visually and with binoculars. The object was very large, approximately 60 feet in diameter. No exhaust or propulsion system was observed. The object accelerated rapidly and sped out of sight. No other aircraft or meteorological phenomena was observed. The entire sighting lasted approximately 3-5 minutes.

DETAILS: At 0333Z on the morning of 13 October 1952, at position 36-20N, 123-16E, the port watch officer aboard a U.S. Naval vessel reported sighting an unidentified flying object. The object was confirmed the target. All hands double-checked the sighting and agreed that the object was not a known aircraft. It was about 60 feet in diameter, circular in shape, and had no wings, fins, or tail surfaces visible. Out altitude was approximately 1,000 feet. The object appeared to be stationary at first, then accelerated with tremendous speed and disappeared from sight within a few seconds. The craft's illumination was so bright that it caused the observers to shield their eyes. The hull shape and speed of the object indicated that it was not conventional aircraft known to be in the area. The time of the sighting was approximately five minutes.

The moon was full and visibility was relatively good. I tried to silhouette the object against the moon to obtain a picture, but was unable to. Its high attitude when within good visual range was extremely "cocked up" at an angle of about twenty-five degrees, indicating a very high speed and the necessity to keep airborne at slower speeds.

(4) Contact:
Heading -   Approximately same as planes 4500 jt.  
Altitude -  
Course -    270o (approximate)  
Distance -  12 miles (by radar)

c. Summary of events:
A flight gunner, on lookout duty at an open waist hatch, sighted a light on the port side and notified the FD. The FD saw the light and brought the contact to the attention of the CO. The radioman confirmed the contact, reporting the distance as 12 miles. The speed of the target was observed to be 200 knots (approximate). The color of the planes seemed to vary during the period of observation, changing from yellow-white to reddish-orange. The color changes were apparently connected to the changes in the speed of the planes, with a reddish-orange color associated with the higher speeds. Radar contact was lost, but visual contact was maintained until the target disappeared over the horizon, at a distance estimated to be approximately 25 miles. During the period it was observed, the target traveled an estimated distance of forty-five miles. No evasive action was taken and no countermeasures were employed.

d. Patrol Plane Commander's Narrative:
At 0235Z on the date of 23 October 1951, as spotted station 33-32, at position 38-16N 123-16E, Yellow Sea, a contact approximately 12 miles distant was observed on radar.

Transcribing the text from the document:

Lt 25 Oct 1950 APO 925, Seo'al: Unidentified air contact, to Kk, HQ USAF.

A long distance claim at twelve miles bearing 270 degrees relative. Pilots could clearly see the craft and the apparent size of the car seat. All hands distinctly observed and confirmed sighting. Plane was traveling at 27,000 feet, heading 270 degrees, forward airspeed was 175 knots. The craft suddenly accelerated instantly to a speed estimated in excess of 800 knots, climbing sharply, decelerated rapidly to 16 miles where it hovered briefly then accelerated sharply and disappeared from view. Our altitude was 5,000 feet. The craft was estimated to be about 50 feet in diameter. Visual contact was maintained, however radar contact was lost. During this visual sighting, all hands observed the craft through the binoculars. The craft's shape changed throughout the sighting and it was observed to be a circular, disc-shaped craft, which was very bright and appeared to cast a shadow. The craft accelerated slowly to 16 miles, where it hovered briefly, then accelerated sharply and disappeared. The craft accelerated slowly to 16 miles, where it hovered briefly, then accelerated sharply and disappeared. The visual contact was also lost due to the craft's high speed.

The craft's flight was extremely bright, of a solid full, color it seemed to blink on and off with a much different appearance. The wings were swept back and down with a dihedral as of a high speed jet. The tips appeared to be glowing and possibly to suffice for a rudder as none was visible.

The speed was so fast it was almost impossible to estimate. A typical jet interceptor could not overtake it.

It is concluded that this sighting contains valid information substantiating the existence of an unidentified air contact.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. The following report was received from Patrol Squadron 46, through the Commander, Itakura Search and Patrol Group.

a. Patrol Plane Commander - Ensign George Gregory
   Pilot - LTJG Matthew Davis
   Mission - Weather Reconnaissance for TS 95-11
   Date Returning Officer - LT(JC) Whitehead, AO, VR-46

b. Initial conditions at time of contact:
   (1) Meteorological Data:
       Cloud formations - 6/10 from 10000 to 25000 feet
       Visibility - 6/10 from 5000 to 6000 feet
       Wind - 240°/25 knots
       Moon Phase - Full
       Elevation - 7,000 feet
       Azimuth - 235° True
   (2) Time: 0332 LT+1M
   (3) Patrol Plane:
       Heading - 160°, True
       Position - 38°15'N, 123°16'E
       Altitude - 9,800 feet
   (4) Contact:
       Heading - Approx. same as Mariner
       Altitude - 10,500 feet
       Bearing - 170° (Approximate)
       Distance - 15 miles (Estimated)

c. Summary of events:
   A weather gunner, on lookout duty at an open waist hatch, sighted a bright light on the starboard bow of the Patrol Plane. The light was estimated to be 15-20 miles distant. It was observed to have a definite pulsating action, varying in intensity as though the light were rotating or oscillating. The Patrol Plane Commander confirmed the contact, described as pulsating, approximately same size as a pocket or small lit light. The size, shape, and color of the flame remained constant during the 15-20 second observation period. It suddenly disappeared, seemingly by going into a reverse or closing action. Evidently the craft turned away, maintaining its distance of 15-20 miles. Radar contact was lost, but visual contact was maintained until the craft disappeared from sight. Maximum speed was estimated at four miles per minute.

2. Later comments made by personnel who submitted the original report:
a. Maneuvering:
(1) The object apparently was flying an intercept course because: (a) It was flying at a very low rate of speed, approximately the same as the Marine Mariner plane which was flying at an indicated air speed of about 100 knots. (b) The turns were extremely sharp as it maneuvered, describing an almost circular path (approx 2500 ft). (c) The object came to an almost complete stop in mid-air, a maneuver impossible for the Marine Mariner plane. (d) Arrows advance on the object. This was the greatest advantage the Marine Mariner plane had in keeping the object under observation, which would have been very difficult for the Marine Mariner plane to do under other circumstances.
b. Radar:
(2) Radar contact was made with the object at the time of sighting and held continuously until the object disappeared. Radar confirmed the visual sighting of the object from 25,000 yards to about 8,000 yards. No reason available for the loss of the radar contact at 8 miles is that the object may have turned or descended to an altitude below the radar beam return.
c. Radar plots of the object are included as Inclosure #1 and #2.
d. Sketch made by the patrol plane commander is attached as Inclosure #3.
COMMENTS BY PREPARING OFFICER:
Visual limitations at this distance at night have precluded accurate observation and measurement. Substantial variations in reports of speed and altitude by observers further substantiate the difficulty of obtaining precise data on the object under the existing circumstances. Whether this object had any special significance is not apparent, since the intermittent sighting and maneuvering, as reported, might appear as a craft with no operational purpose, or it might represent a test or demonstration flight of a new type of aircraft, possibly a special-purpose missile.
