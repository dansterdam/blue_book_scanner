The image does not contain a photograph, only text. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

To what was the angular size? hold a match at arm's length in front of a known object, such as a street light or the moon. Note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match; now if you had an object of that angular size, how large would it be at the time of the sighting. Estimate what fraction of the angular size of the watch.

The image does not contain any photograph or visual content. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing a detailed questionnaire filled out by a witness.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

DO YOU USUALLY WEAR GLASSES? [YES] [NO]
IS WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE SPEED OF THE PHENOMENON? [GIVE ESTIMATE OF SPEED]
IS WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE DISTANCE OF THE PHENOMENON? [GIVE ESTIMATE OF DISTANCE]
DESCRIBE WHAT YOU SAW. INCLUDE INFORMATION ON SIZE, COLOR, NUMBER, FORMATION, ETC. OF OBJECT(S).
A COMMON OBJECT OR OBJECTS WHICH, WHEN PLACED IN THE SKY, SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU NOTED THE PHENOMENON COULD BE SOME DISTANCE AWAY. TO WHAT DO YOU COMPARE THE SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON?

The image contains a hand-drawn compass rose diagram and two illustrations depicting landscapes. The illustration on the left shows a person standing on a road or path with hills or mountains in the background. The illustration on the right appears to be a zoomed-in view of a portion of the landscape from the left-hand illustration.

Now acting as an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM YOU TO THE POINT LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN THE FIRST AND LAST SIGHTING. THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS PART.
