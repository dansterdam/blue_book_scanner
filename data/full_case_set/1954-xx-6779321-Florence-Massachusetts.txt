UNCLASSIFIED DATE
SOUTCES HAPPY SWAMP ST. , 1940

For the last few years I have had a guilty conscience for fighting and reporting many experiences in 1954. All of these happened in a rural area near Florence, Indiana, where I spent my summers and where I am still very interested in my experience. 

We lived in a small rented farmhouse and we are in a very hilly, woody area. My widowed grandmother owned a plot of ground with a couple of hundred acres near our farmhouse. The stories we heard in the countryside and some actual events here decided me to go to my mother for a short time in 1954. I had become uneasy before that time.

One evening in the middle of June, about 8 PM, my cousin, who was about 18 years old, and I decided to take a walk down the lane and back. The fields on each side of the lane were in a semi-hilly state, as these were rolling hills. As we walked quietly down the lane I heard a humming sound which kept getting louder. It did not come from the direction of the farmhouse. I told my cousin to be quiet and I stood still and listened. The humming sound grew louder and seemed to be coming from the field to the right of the lane. I then saw a strange object in the sky, shaped something like a pancake with a hole in the middle. It was hovering or seemed to be just a short distance off the ground in the field. I could see no windows or lights on it. The object was about 30 ft. in diameter and appeared to be a dull metallic color. The humming sound was almost deafening by this time.

We both became frightened and started to run back toward the farmhouse. As we did so, the object seemed to rise slowly straight up until it disappeared from sight. The humming sound also seemed to die away as the object rose.

When we reached the farmhouse, I explained to my grandmother what we had seen. She said that a few days before she had seen strange lights in the sky in that same location. She had not mentioned it for fear of being laughed at. After this incident, any time I went for a walk in that area, I kept looking skyward, but never saw the object again.

I have often wondered what that object was and where it came from. I feel quite sure it was not an airplane or any known aircraft. The object made no noise like a plane and had no lights. If I had not seen it with my own eyes I would not have believed it. Even now, many years later, I can still see that strange object in my mind's eye.

The image appears to contain a handwritten document or report related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s. The document is dated July 29, 1957.

The text in the document states:

"Dear Sir:
About three years ago when I lived in North Hampton, Mass. I was called at the Easthampton Smith Co. in Florence, Mass. and a gentleman representing himself as an official from the Air Force quested certain information concerning sightings of unidentified flying objects. It was the claim on his part that these sightings had been brought to his attention and that he would like to have further information I could give him regarding the time and circumstances of this occurrence. As a result of this interview I was asked to sign a statement which I did.
Since that time I have followed with a great deal of interest the various reports of unidentified flying objects in the press and on television, feeling that perhaps my experience might be of value to someone making a serious study of the subject.
In view of recent reports of observations of unidentified flying objects in New Madrid, Missouri area, I am prompted to write and tell you of my experience. You may recall that this incident ocurred in the Florence area some three years ago. I could never learn from any Air Force officials what conclusions if any were reached as a result of my statement.
I am now living in Worcester, Mass. and if you feel that my experience might be of any value in your study of this subject I should be glad to discuss it with you further. I shall be most happy to cooperate in any way I can in your work.
Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
Worcester, Mass."

DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY

IN REPLY REFER TO

Ser 110-984
Car 110-1984

Northampton, Massachusetts 

My dear friend:

This is in reply to your letter of 30 July 1957 telling of an unusual experience you had. First, I want to thank you for reporting this incident, and I believe it might be the basis for testing telephone equipment from the bottom of the sea. 

The Navy is always interested to hear new ideas for improving its equipment, and it is particularly pleased to hear from individual citizens who wish to bring these matters to the Navy's attention. The Navy is constantly receiving many suggestions for improvements and it is always glad to consider them. I believe that our knowledge of these matters has advanced to the point where we will be able to make use of your idea which you have so kindly submitted to us.

It is my understanding that the Department of the Air Force is coordinating all reports in identified flying objects and can be consulted for further information on this matter. I am referring your letter to that Department for evaluation and further reply to you.

Sincerely yours,

L. Miller
Deputy for Legislation & Liaison
