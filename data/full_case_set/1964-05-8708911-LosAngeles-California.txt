Transcribing the text:

I investigated the sighting in preparation for the report, and I have never seen a plane, star, or any thing flying in my mind because I was so afraid that the sound seemed to awain from me.

Dear alone, and his mother, a lot little known from Seattle, case you have a completely reported sighting, it is my choice. Respect fully.

Dear Sir:

At the suggestion of the L.C. Polis Dept. 
We're sending you the facts) an event the ordinary 
May 25, 1964 sometime between 9:30 PM.

From my 5th floor apt. just below General Schaub 
Step in the apt. I noticed at my window I
thought I saw a giant jelline building 
for the building - but there was a light.

Considerable damage to this building from 
unknown cause is a big job. Slight damage 
to the Empire State building a little like
the lights were seen. It was not possible  more 
to send some I realized the lights were
very strange, leaving approach at high
speed. The sound was tremendous in the building  
at the time of this apparent observation: those who 
had experienced this did not appeared startled.
