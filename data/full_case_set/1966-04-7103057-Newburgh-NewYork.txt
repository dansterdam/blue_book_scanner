Dear Sir:

I am related to you the facts of an unidentified flying object I saw there in the early morning of April 22, 1966.

At about 7:07 P.M. E.S.T. traveling north on Quaker Road in Wappingers Falls, N.Y. we observed a bright, bluish-white glow object. It was 2 or 3 miles in the distance, traveling very swiftly. From west to east, it was sighted that I am sure more what can I say without it.

It seems to get larger the farther it went, and then it went out of sight in a matter of seconds. It appeared to me to be about the size of a basketball at the peak of its brightness. My daughter, Marie, and three of my sons were with me at the time and they all saw the object. They were just as mystified as I was as to what it could have been. We waited for a short while but saw nothing further.

My daughter Marie and I counted the time it took from the moment we first saw it until it disappeared, which was about 13 seconds.

I thought you should know this. If I can be of any further assistance, please let me know.

Sincerely yours,
(Signature)
Cortland, N.Y. 11720

9 April 23,
There was something strange that happened to me last night that I thought youought to know about. At about 9:00 p.m. an object that looked like a saucer, about 30 or 40 feet in diameter, hovered over my house for over 15 minutes. It had a brilliant light that seemed to be the source of the light itself.
I wanted to report this to you as soon as possible. Please let me know if you would like any further information from me.
Sincerely yours,
Richard Melby

Mrs. Katrina Hale
Rock Hill, N. Y. 12775
Saturday, April 23

Dear Sirs,

I read in today's newspaper of some people having contacted your office after seeing the bright object in the sky on Friday night. I saw it too, and wonder if this matter is being investigated. According to the government, it should not officially have been seen on that date.

I am talking about the calisthenic crowd when a large bright light was seen by many. It seemed much larger than the usual sighting, but seemed much higher than the nature of the "sparkler-ers" the children light and hold on the 4th of July, and it seemed to have flashed on and off quite nicely.

We said it sounded about a jet, and he teased me about "flying saucers", and then we did not give it more thought, till I saw this article in the Record. I felt it best to notify you for any records you see or such her.

Sincerely
[Signature redacted]
