SPOT REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

1. Unidentified Flying Objects:
a. Number: 3
b. Location: Dublin, Georgia, northwest sector. 
c. Date and Time: 3 September 1952 at 1730 hours EDT.
d. Description: 3 round luminous objects moving slowly at high altitude, estimated at 50,000 feet. Objects were first observed heading west to east, then changed direction 90 degrees to the north. They were observed for about 15 minutes. The objects appeared to be elongated and luminous, somewhat resembling a flaming or fiery flying saucer. The light was steady and did not blink. The objects maintained a level altitude in flight and did not climb, dive or make any acrobatic maneuvers.

2. Mrs. G._ stated that at approximately 1730 hours EDT on 3 September 1952, she was working in her garden when she noticed 3 objects in the sky to the north and slightly east of her position. She stated that the objects were extremely bright and appeared elongated. She further stated that as she continued to observe the objects, they suddenly changed direction 90 degrees to the north and continued on this northward course at a steady, level altitude.

3. No sound, vibration, smoke, flame, or odor was detected.

4. Nothing can be added to the description and position of the objects as given in the newspaper reports about them.

5. No conclusion as to the identity of the objects can be offered. They do not appear to be any conventional type of aircraft."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SPOT REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

1. Unidentified Flying Objects:
a. Observers: Mrs. Irma Warne, Robins AFB, Ga.
b. Location: Dublin, Georgia, Northwest sector.
c. Date and Time: 3 September 1952 at 1730 hours EST.
d. Weather: (Official report of the weather fighter section) Visibility 11 miles - ceiling 30,000 ft. Wind - Northeast 10 mph.

2. Mrs. Irma Warne, Dublin, Georgia, was interviewed by a representative of this office at 1735 hours, 3 September 1952. She stated that she observed a bright unidentified object in the sky which appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed and emitting a bright light. The object was first sighted by Mrs. Warne and appeared to be moving toward the Veterans Administration Hospital. It was observed for approximately 5-10 minutes during which time the object changed direction and appeared to be hovering over the area. The object then moved off at a high rate of speed in a northeast direction and disappeared from sight. Mrs. Warne states that she is very familiar with the types of aircraft in the area and stated that this object was definitely not any type of conventional aircraft or known object. She could not determine its exact size or altitude, but stated it appeared much larger than a conventional aircraft and was at a high altitude.

3. No other witnesses to the sighting were reported. The object was not picked up on radar, and no other aircraft were reported in the area at the time of the sighting.

4. Mrs. Irma Warne has taken no particular interest in the subject of flying saucers and has no known tendencies to present imaginative or fantastic reports. The facts as presented seem to indicate an unidentified flying object was observed in the Dublin, Georgia area.

Dear Major Kennedy:

In receipt of your letter of September 19, with additional negative to the recent unidentified aerial photograph.

Permits me to say that I did not see the phenomena. The people involved, Mrs. [REDACTED] and Mrs. [REDACTED], have telephoned their report of the sighting to the newspapers and so many other persons that it seems no earnest were they in their reports, and apparently are convinced that what they saw was not an explainable natural phenomenon. As I am not an expert in these matters, I can only pass on the information as it was given to me.

I appreciate the two officers and the interest you have in the report and regret that I can be of no further service.

Sincerely yours,
Parris Carr Williams

2. Here is the 23-year-old lieutenant's account as related to a representative of this office on 2 September 1952: The lieutenant stated that on the afternoon of 1 September 1952, at approximately 1730 hours, while standing in an open area on the base, he observed four (4) circular, metallic-appearing objects traveling toward the southwest at an altitude of approximately 15 degrees above the horizon. The objects were estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet and were observed for a period of approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The objects appeared to be approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter and were traveling in a horizontal line, with one object slightly ahead of the others. The objects appeared to be moving at a speed estimated to be in excess of 500 miles per hour and were on a steady course, without any noticeable change in altitude or speed. The objects disappeared from sight in the southwest.

3. The objects appeared to be traveling at a constant altitude but moving in a horizontal line. No trail or exhaust was observed. The objects appeared metallic and were not blinking lights. No sound was noted.

4. No additional information was obtained. The lieutenant stated that he was offering no theories as to the identity of the objects.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text of the document is as follows:

"SPOT REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

1. Unidentified Flying Objects:
a. Observers: XXXXXXX
b. Location: Dublin, Georgia, northwest sector
c. Date and Time: 2 September 1952 at 1730 hours EST.
d. Weather: (Official Report of the Weather Station) 
1952 hours - Visibility 15 + ceiling 20,000 ft.
2200 - Visibility 15 + ceiling 18,000 ft.
21-20 - Temperature 51 degrees - Wind northwest.

2. This object was first observed by XXXXXXX, age 29, a city official, at 1700 hours on 2 September 1952. XXXXX stated that he first observed the objects in the northwest sky. There were three objects, white in color, which moved across the sky in a straight line, at a high rate of speed. They were observed for about 1 minute and 15 seconds. The objects appeared to be about the size of a 25 cent piece held at arm's length. The objects moved in the direction of northwest to southeast. After about 1 minute and 15 seconds they appeared to stop, hover, and then resumed their original direction and speed. They were observed to do this twice. Approximately 35 seconds later they appeared to tilt and then disappeared from sight.

3. It is estimated that the objects appeared to be traveling fairly fast, possibly 600-700 mph, and the objects appeared to be about the size of a small fighter plane.

4. The weather was bright and clear. She detected no noise, odor, or vibration, and made no attempt to present in pictorial form the outline and position of the objects.

5. The witness has no technical training in flying and has read only what appeared in the newspapers about these cases."
