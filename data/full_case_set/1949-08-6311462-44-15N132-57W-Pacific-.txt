On 27 August 1949, 1st Lt JOHN HAYT, AO-769496, Navigator, 374th Recon Sq. (VLR) Weather, Fairfield-Suisun AFB, California, was interviewed and stated in substance: On 2 august 1949 while on a "Lark Dog" Weather mission out of Fairfield-Suisun AFB, California, at approximately position number six (6) 44 degrees 15 minutes North and 132 degrees and 57 minutes West at 1729 hours he observed an unusual formation of what appeared to be either contrails or clouds at a clock position of 10 o'clock high. When the formation was first sighted, segments of a cloud-like trail were observed coming out of the clouds which formed an undercast of approximately five tenths (5/10) and coverage at fifteen hundred (1500) feet. MIT stated that after first observing the formations he had directed turrets in that additional segments of the cloud-like strewn had been formed and had joined together with the first segments, behind the aircraft covered portions of the undercast. The streaks appeared to have been formed out of the tops of clouds coming up undercast at approximately 1500 feet, and ascended at an angle of approximately 35 degrees to an altitude of approximately fifteen thousand (15,000) feet and continued at an angle of approximately 17 degrees to the horizon to approximately seventeen thousand (17,000) feet. The aircraft of "Lark Dog" mission was turned off course and photographs were taken by the aircraft commander. MIT advised that in his opinion the head of the formation was bearing towards the western coasts of the United States which was approximately four hundred (400) miles distant. MIT further advised that in his opinion if the aircraft of "Lark Dog" mission had assumes the track of the cloud-like formation, the approximate landfall would have been Eureka, California. MIT stated that the intense of the trail were broken in several areas and at one the formation end that the period of observation the cloud did not disappear through evaporation but was lost to sight after "Lark Dog" mission continued on the scheduled flight. MIT further stated that there was approximately 1/10th to 2/10ths scattered cloud coverage above fifteen hundred (1500) feet, MIT stated that estimates concerning the altitude, and distance from observation, of the unusual formation were difficult to make because there were no known objects for

comparison. MATT further stated that no object was observed either in
the air, nor on the sea.

4. On 12 September 1949, 1st Lt. PHILIP G. KEPP, AO-936613,
Weather Observer, 374th Recon Sq. (VLR) Weather, Fairfield-Suisun AFB,
California, was interviewed and stated his attention on the day 2
August 1949, at approximately 1730 hours S.T.P., was directed,
by the navigator, to an unusual formation which appeared at 10 o'clock
high, in relation to the track of flight of the "Lark Dog" mission
aircraft. KEPP further stated that the formation appeared to have
formed out of the top of the clouds forming an undercast at approxi-
mately fifteen hundred (1500) feet and ascended to an altitude of
approximately seventeen thousand (17,000) feet. KEPP stated that
the formation appeared was approximately nine square (3x3) alto
cumulus clouds (1500) feet was approaching the light coverage of
cirrus clouds and the cloud-like formation observed was almost perpen-
dicular to the line of the undercast clouds. KEPP advised that in his
opinion the formation could have been caused by a jet type aircraft
although contrails at that altitude were improbable. No type of air-
craft was observed and no unusual sounds were heard. KEPP stated that
he could not estimate the speed at which the streaks had been formed.
KEPP further advised that only three (3) of the crew members observed
the unusual formation and that the formation of "angel" fog is normally
not attempt to assume the track of the formation because the pilot did
not consider it important enough to turn off the scheduled course. 
KEPP stated that he did not notice any unusual noises on radio reception
and that no object was picked up by the radar equipment of the "Lark
Dog" mission aircraft which was in operation at the time of sighting.
KEPP further stated that the formation was approximately four hundred
(400) miles off the coast of California, and was in sight for
approximately fifteen (15) minutes until the course of flight of the
"Lark Dog" mission lost it to view.

DETAILS:

   1. This investigation was requested by Colonel JOHN C. SHARP,
District Commander, DO #19, Fairfield-Suisun AFB, California, and
predicated upon receipt of an Intelligence Report from the 374th
Reconnaissance Squadron (VLR) Weather, Fairfield-Suisun AFB, California,
dated 5 August 1949, reporting the sighting of an unusual aerial
phenomenom at 1729 hours, 2 August 1949, by 1st LT GLEN D. HULL, AO-
936481, 1st LT JOHN HATT, AO-769696 and 1st PHILLIP C. KNAPP, AO-814090,
all crew members of the "Lark Dog" weather mission, while on a scheduled
weather flight at approximately position number six (6) 44 degrees 15
minutes North and 132 degrees 57 minutes West.

AT FAIRFIELD-SUISUN AFB, CALIFORNIA

   2. On 27 August 1949 1st LT GLEN D. HULL, AO-936481, Aircraft
Commander, 374th Recon Sq (VLR) Weather, Fairfield-Suisun AFB, California,
was interviewed and stated in substance: On Tuesday 2 August 1949 "Lark
Dog" weather mission took off from Fairfield-Suisun AFB, California at
1330 hours MWT and started on the 1st leg of its weather flight to the
prescribed course and altitude, a true bearing of 300 degrees at fifteen
hundred (1500) feet, at their position number six (6) 44 degrees 15
minutes North and 132 degrees 57 minutes west his attention was directed
by the navigator, 1st LT JOHN MATT, to what appeared to be an unusual
cloud formation in the eastern sky. The object or streaks which appeared
to be clouds was first observed to be up at a great distance above the
clouds at fifteen hundred (1500) feet and second at a shallow angle,
approximately 37 degrees to the horizon, to be about fifteen thousand(15,000)
feet and then, continued at an angle of approximately 17-1/2 degrees to an
altitude of approximately seventeen thousand (17,000) feet. The formation
thin, wide in color, was approximately seventy-five (75) miles distant
from the point of observation. No unusual sounds were heard and HULL
stated that he did not see the streaks form and he could not
estimate the speed of formation. MATT rather stated that his first
impression of the visual moment on was that it might have been a
contrail, possibly formed by an unseen object. After the second segment
had been formed and the two had joined into a continuous streak HULL
turns his aircraft off course and took a photograph with a K-20 Aerial
Camera. The photograph is attached as inclosure to this report. No
object of any type was sighted during the period of observation, approxi-
mately 15 minutes, and the formation was lost to view after the "Lark Dog"
mission returned to course and continued on the scheduled flight. HULL
advised that three members of the crew observed the unusual aerial
phenomenon. Crew members participating in the "Lark Dog" weather mission
of 2 August 1949 were:
