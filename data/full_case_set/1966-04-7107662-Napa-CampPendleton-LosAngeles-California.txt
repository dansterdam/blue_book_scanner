There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document, presumably a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Based on the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the text in the document, the output is as follows:

awoke the Provost Marshals' Office Duty Officer, Staff SGT R. E. LEE.

They returned outside and at this time the object appeared to have taken
a solid roundish shape, with one trailing edge. The trailing edge was pointing
eastward. They observed the object in this position for a period of approximately 5 to 10 minutes, and while observed, it changed to a "tear drop" shape
and stayed in this shape until approximately 0510 hours, when it could no
longer be seen due to the incoming daylight. This object was sighted by
approximately 7 members of the Duty Section of the MILITARY POLICE COMPANY.
Brief statements were obtained from each of the above individuals.

3. Reference (a) will be forwarded ASAP to OF2 via OFl by mail today.
NISSA/Camp Pendleton will coordinate any further information regarding this 
matter with the Provost Marshals' Office and the Base G-2 Office.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce all the text found in the document:

21 April 66

Extensive military training in all probability the sighting. The crew flying a military aircraft. Very high speed, no sound, and flight path entirely unpredictable. No doubt in my mind other reports similar should be carefully investigated. The subject matter of national importance and should be treated accordingly.

Reliably and distinctly on the date 16 April 
1966 an unknown luminous object was observed in the sky over the Camp Pendleton area in California. The object was described as being elliptical in shape and emitting a steady light. It was observed at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet and at a distance of an estimated 15 to 20 miles. The object remained stationary for approximately 10 minutes, then moved in a north-westerly direction at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.

AT 2300 LOOK TUDEE FLASHED DOWN IN UNIT (2-4) AND INFORMED ME OF A UFO IN THE ARIA. I OBSERVED A GLOWING GREEN LIGHT SHAPED LIKE A HORSESHOE, WHICH WAS OVER LAKE O' NEAS. I RADIO'D IN THAT THERE WAS A REPORT OF A UFO AND THAT I COULD OBSERVE SAME.
I WAS TOLD TO KEEP SAME IN VIEW AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. I OBSERVED THE GLOWING GREEN "CLOUD" FOR ABOUT AN HOUR BUT WHEN THE SUN BEGAN TO RISE THE CLOUDING CLOUD DISAPPEARED.
THERE WAS NO NOISE AND THE OBJECT CHANGED SHAPES FROM A "HORSESHOE" SHAPE TO A "TEARDROP" SHAPE. AS THE SUN CAME UP THE OBJECT FADED AND DRIFTED OUT TOWARD THE OCEAN.

STATE REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT OBSERVED AT 2300 HOURS
ON APPROXIMATELY 21 MARCH 1956 WITHIN BOUNDARIES OF SAN
DIEGO, CALIFORNIA
On approximately 2110 hours on 21 March 1956 the writer received a phone call from Lt. Garrison, Pendleton, Marine Corps Air Station, who reported that observers at Camp Pendleton had reported an unidentified object in the sky. The object was first sighted over Laguna Beach, California, moving in an easterly direction, and was tracked across the sky by observers at Camp Pendleton and at the Los Angeles Interceptor Center, where it was picked up on radar. The object was described as moving in an erratic manner, zigzagging and changing in elevation. It was in sight for approximately 15-20 minutes. The object was described as a single light source, varying in intensity from bright to dim, sometimes showing a reddish hue. At times the object appeared to be two separate objects, one apparently higher than the other. It was lost to visual observation in the haze, but the radar track continued. The exact nature of the object could not be determined. The radar track was measurable, and the object appeared to be traveling at a speed in excess of 2000 mph. The description and the radar tracking would indicate that the object was not a conventional aircraft and should be classified as an unidentified aerial phenomenon.

1. The following is an extract from the Staff Duty Officers Report
1630 - 20 April 66 to 0800 hours - 21 April 1966.

21 April 66 - 0430 hours. Mr. and friend saw a greenish light which appeared in the form of a horseshoe near a hill. The light changed to a round disc-shaped illumination mark.

Location of Observer: North [REDACTED] street near Echo Park.
Direction: North

Observer is a two truck driver and sounded sober.  

Mr initial reaction was that it was a vapor trail from a VAFB launch, but I couldn't see anything unusual from the second floor, Building A.
