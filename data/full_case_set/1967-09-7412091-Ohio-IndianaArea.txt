Major Hector Quintanilla,

Dear Major Quintanilla:

In reply to the letter enclosed in the large set of reports on probable firebolls received yesterday, September 1, 1967.

We have two reports from aircraft, one of 1:21 and one was 0213.2, probably some observation on Sept. 1, 1967 before the approximate time you mention. So I regret to say we have no information of use to you.

Thank you for this request. It will take some time to go through our old reports. and search for the object in which case examination would be undertaken to see if an astronomical path could be calculated.

The report from Clyanne, Wya., for object of 28 March, 1967, - a truck on the ground with luminescence and glow-internal, 1s is very similar to work on that the much longer unexplained observations used. The complexity must scare many observers. This method will verify multiple observers.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, likely describing a sighting of unidentified flying objects.

COMMENTS: Sighting #1: Another aircraft apparently sighted object #1. The time of the sighting was given as 08382 and duration as 10 seconds. Also a ground-visual sighting was made at 09450. They indicated course was NE and duration as 10 seconds. Because the initial observer stated that this object was in view at 08382, it is quite possible it could have been the same object seen at 09450. Sighting #2: Appears to have been a meteor-like object seen by another observer that he thought may have been a satellite.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

In regard to your letter (undated) recently received with reference to a UFO Observation on September 24h, 1967, I am enclosing a copy of report number #385 which appears to fit the location and time you describe in your letter.

The NORAD file with regard to report #385 indicated that there was no known TIP (tracking and impact prediction) ready for that location at that time.

The SAO (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory) file for this report indicated that this event was a meteor or fireball entry into our atmosphere.

This does not of course, rule out the possibility of a piece of uncontrolled debris re-entering the atmosphere and causing the event that you describe in your letter.

If there is anything further that I can help you with, do not hesitate to write.

Sincerely Yours,

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

21 December 1967

Captain G. C. Davis called and wanted to know if we received his report.

He said that he saw the first object for about 2 minutes. At first it looked like an aircraft with landing lights on, then it started streaming sparks.

Captain Davis compared it to grinding steel on an emory wheel.

He said he saw the saw the second object, it was going up and down. The object moved across and started to stream orange flames. It passed below the horizon and disappeared just before it hit the ground. Ninety seconds later it reappeared, rose up to their altitude and flew parallel with them for approximately twenty minutes.

Captain Davis said that he had seen satellite decays many times before and that he didn't think these were satellite decays. Captain will call back later today.

If we send him a 117 he will give it to a           . He stated that he would like Dr. Menzel's address so he could send him a copy of the sighting.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
21 December 1967
Called SPADATS and talked to Lt. Canitelli.
Object 293L, Oes 176 debris, decayed on the 13th at 2000 Z ; approximately 12 hours; this satellite has a maximum of 72.9° inclination. However, the analysts didn't think the object would break up into two pieces. They did not have accurate enough records to plot the trajectory to find out if the object passed over Indiana at or near the time of the sighting.
Certain information on the debris is classified. Lt. Canitelli requested that we send a copy of the case to Lt. Levin when we are through.

20 Sept. 1967

Called Indianapolis Center (317-244-2495 ) about aircraft sighting
of 14 Sept. 08/;02; 04 09172.
At the present we have the report of the Saturn 777 but we 
have no info. on the Universal 689. The controller John E presdorf
said that the Sept of the 777 may know the Capt of the 689. He also
said that both reported the 08/02 sighting at the same time and
gave the same position for the object. Later both reported
bright lights off of their right wings. Radar at the center
sporadically painted an object off the right wing of the 689
for about 20 mins. However Mr. Presdorf said that it might have
been what he called Angels, because it was a sporadic paint,
very close in a while they would see something for only a sweep
or two.

Time - 14/0902Z. Received thru Patterson Tower.
Aircraft Saturn 777, DC-6, departed Patterson AFB at 0840Z. Called Patterson tower and advised of a UFO sighting five minutes out over Dayton Omni.
Captain Davis, Aircraft Commander, stated the object was a bright white light moving from south to north with trailing sparks. Captain Davis was at 25,000 feet estimated the object at 55,000 feet. The object put on a burst of speed and was lost to observation. The aircraft was on V-50 enroute Indianapolis, Indiana. This would put the object due west of the aircraft when last observed.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten account of an alleged UFO sighting. The text describes an incident where the "pieces fell off the main body" of an aircraft, which then "disappeared completely". The document mentions that the "main body continued to glow" as it descended. There is no image of the alleged UFO or aircraft present in this document.

Text from the document:

First officer: first saw satellite 
and in a voice of excitement said, 
"Look, look!" Later he said he 
thought it was an aircraft disintegration
as the pieces fell off the main
body they glowed white then 
disappeared. The main body continued
to glow as it descended but with
a glow somewhat less intense the
the pieces that had previously fallen
off. It disappeared completely when about 
45 to left and 30 high.

At 9:22 sighting of white light about 20 miles 2 o'clock our position light disappeared behind clouds which revealed about over speed light changed altitude vertically straight up and down to 15.0 to 20.0 feet and down to approximately 1.5 to 3.0 feet. Change color light appeared to be trailing for about 400 to 500 feet and light went out.

14 September 1967 22:52/2274. FFD-TIK
Crew: [REDACTED]

After departure from FFO, we proceeded direct to Dayton VOR, climbing to 10,000 feet. Upon passing the station at 05302 at 5,000 feet, climbing I called attention to the appearance of stationary lights slightly higher than 5,000 feet. The traffic was northbound, moving at a high rate of speed. We estimate distance to be about 3,000 feet from the tail area. The lights were then observed to be three in number, white in color, and the lights on the object proper were then observed to be three in number, white of high intensity. The object disappeared at 1730 o'clock position. This phenomenon was not unlike that which has been previously reported. I estimate that we observed the sighting. This was not a conventional aircraft or meteor.

II. 11/4/35
At 0912z, our altitude 10,000 feet, heading 244 degrees, an object trailing brilliant green and orange lights was sighted in about a 30 degree downward trajectory and the flames disappeared. This was sighted at our 2 o'clock position. 20 degrees down. The rest of the crew was further confirmation of the sighting, but by denial.

III.
At about 0912z, a bright white light (level-high) from 1 o'clock position to about 4:30 to 5 o'clock position. The object traveled the same side of a triangular path on a continuous even keel. Two or three star-like objects were observed for about 30 minutes, and could have been a satellite.

There is no photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. The document appears to be a letter written by Hector Quintanilla, Jr., Major, USAF and the Chief of Project Blue Book, addressed to Dr. Charles P. Olivier of the American Meteorite Society. The letter discusses UFO observations reported between September 10 and September 14, 1967 in the Ohio-Indiana area. The letter also mentions that the observations appear similar to satellite decay and/or meteor observations, and requests that any similar reports be forwarded to Project Blue Book.

Narberth, Pennsylvania 19072

Dear Dr. Olivier:

1. We are in receipt of an unidentified flying object report for the Indiana area which occurred on 14 September 1967 between 3:00 am and 4:15 am. The report consists of two different sightings: at approximately 3:00 am a bright white object, the size of a star, was observed hovering and moving erratically. At 4:12 am another object was observed traveling from the southwest to the northeast. This object was also brilliant, the size of a star, and the flame was orange-white. The objects were observed for approximately two minutes each and were witnessed by several aircraft crews, including our flight. 

2. The above observations appear similar to that of a satellite decay and/or meteor observations and for this reason we would like to plot the trajectory. If this would appreciate any similar reports for these approximate times.

3. Attached are further reports which cover the first nine months of 1967. Hopefully, we will be able to forward the remainder of the reports by the end of 1967. We are in the process of getting out all of the 1967 case files, however, it will take another month or so to finish.

4. We hope that the enclosed cases will be helpful in your studies. Should you feel that any of the reports do not fall within the category of meteors, fireballs or bolide observations we would appreciate your most authoritative opinion.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF

UFO Observation, 14 September 1967

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of unidentified flying
object reports from the Indiana area which occurred on 14 September
1967 between 3:40 am and 4:15 am.

2. The reports contain accounts of two different sightings, at approximately
3:40 am a bright white object that was trailing sparks and flames,
was observed traveling from north to southwest to northeast. At 4:12 am
another object was observed traveling from the southwest to the
northeast. The white object was also trailing flames, but the flames
were observed in a more distinct manner. The object was observed for
two to three minutes each and were witnessed by several aircraft crew members
near Indianapolis one ground observer in Gary, Indiana.

3. These observations appear similar to that of a satellite decay
and for this reason we would like additional information on any
atmospheric conditions on the date of the sightings. Request
information be forwarded to your agency on our findings.

4. Thank you for any assistance you can provide.
