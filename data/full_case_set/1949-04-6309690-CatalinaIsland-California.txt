The image presented appears to be a scanned page from a textual document and does not contain any photographs. It is a handwritten letter with some portions redacted, presumably to protect personal information. I will now proceed to transcribe the visible text from the document:

```
May 1st, 1949 

                Dear Sir:

About 8 o'clock of the
night of April 28th, my wife and a 
school teacher saw six objects in the
sky not in a group, but singly. A 
few minutes later after going to my daughter
home, she and my daughter and my 
grandson saw four more, All travelling in
the same direction. If you are still in-
terested in flying discs, saucers etc., please
let me know and I will write more in
full.

                  Respectfully 
[REDACTED HANDWRITING]

[REDACTED] were on Catalina Island, about [REDACTED] from
Long Beach, Calif.
``` 

Please note that the redacted sections are indicated as such because the handwriting has been obscured with a black marker. The original content underneath the redacted areas is thus not possible to transcribe.
