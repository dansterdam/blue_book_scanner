The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter dated December 17, 1968 from Major James H. Aikman of the Office of Information, Civilian Air Force, responding to a previous letter about an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

SAP-OOCC/MISS TURNURE/765236/DEC. 17, 1968
DEAR MR. (REDACTED),
THIS REPLIES TO YOUR LETTER OF DECEMBER 11, 1963, IN WHICH YOU STATED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO).
UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE FOUND THAT AFTER 30 DAYS, PRECISE DETAILS TEND TO BECOME TOO VAGUE IN THE OBSERVER'S MIND TO PERMIT A USEFUL SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION.
SHOULD YOU SIGHT ANOTHER UFO, PLEASE REPORT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO THE NEAREST AIR FORCE BASE, EACH BASE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVING A UFO INVESTIGATION OFFICE WHO IS ASSIGNED TO CONDUCT A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE IF A MORE EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS IS IN ORDER.
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY YOUR SIGHTING BY LOOKING AT THE CATEGORIES OF OBJECTS OFTEN REPORTED AS UFO'S IN THE ENCLOSED PAMPHLET. IF THE OBJECT YOU SAW FITS ONE OF THESE CATEGORIES, IT WOULD NOT CONSTITUTE A UFO REQUIRING FURTHER INVESTIGATION.
SINCERELY,
JAMES H. AIKMAN
MAJOR, USAF
CHIEF, COMMUNITY RELATIONS DIVISION
OFFICE OF INFORMATION

SAF-OICC 

Gentlemen:

What I am about to relate to you may to some people sound like an attempt for attention.  However, may to me it was so real, as the paper this letter is typed on. Please refer to the map I have attached. 

It was on a night, not too late, in either late July or early August when I made a sighting.It wasn't too dark where shapes couldn't be seen against the sky. I was standing at one of the highest points in Camp Kinder - Ring, in Hopewell June., Poughkeepsie, when while I was looking through a group of trees that formed a "V", I got looking to the like a "teaspoon". It seemed to me to be about the size of a "nickle" or dime in the sky. Over the three lights on the area above the bottom ridge.The color I felt was unimportant to the situation. After about one hour or less of hovering in one position it just seemed to vanish from sight.It didn't really zoom off into the horizon, it just seemed to melt into the sky. Everyone I told scoffed at me so I kept silent, until now when I decided to structure my high school class on the subject,as I have been following it for a number of years. I have no photographs or evidence,except my word,to prove what I saw.In fact even over the facts to myself,I filled out a report as best I could, as isn't a very area.

Please examine what I have told you, and do whatever you feel necessary.

Please get in touch with me soon.

Thank you very much.

The image appears to contain a simple line drawing of what looks like a UFO or unidentified flying object. The drawing shows a rounded, saucer-shaped object with two small circles or openings on the top or bottom. There is also a small stick figure-like shape labeled "U.F.O." next to the drawing.

Text from the document:

IS DRAW A SKETCH THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT. INCLUDE ANGULAR SHAPE, SIZE, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS. INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.
