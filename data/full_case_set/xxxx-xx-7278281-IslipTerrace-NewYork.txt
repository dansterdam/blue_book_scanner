SAFOICC/Turnurs/va/72079/2300+87

Dear XXXXX,

This will reply to your letter of October 11 in which you described your observations of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Many details necessary to positive identification of the sightings now missing, and without further information, identification would be virtually impossible. If you care to complete the attached questionnaire, and submit it with any additional information, identification can be attempted.

In the meantime, we are enclosing a copy of our latest project blue book report which may help you in identifying what you saw.

Sincerely,
DAVID L. STILES, Major, USAF
Acting Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division

Re: Mr. T. Voigt

Dear Sirs,
Con, C.?9. 11?67 at 545
Concerning a recent visitation October 11, 1967 at 545 (17:45) of an unidentified device over our backyards Islip Terrace, N.Y. We saw the object up there for a considerable length of time. It was traveling at a slow rate and then suddenly increased its speed and disappeared. Towards the end its the object appeared to glow, and then it suddenly increased its speed and disappeared from our view. We have a considerable knowledge of aviation and we feel this phenomenon is probably extremely important if properly investigated, both scientifically and technically.
Please advise us concerning the proper channel at which we should report this occurrence. We are sincerely hoping it receives serious consideration by your authorities.
Sincerely,

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text on a document. The text appears to be a descriptive account or narrative of some kind of observed phenomenon, potentially related to a UFO sighting or report. 

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Viewed two of them zooming from this window. They traveled rapidly at a terrific speed in a straight line into the sky. They were disc shaped, bright white in color and appeared to be about 20 feet in diameter. There was no sound whatsoever. After they had traveled about 100 feet, they accelerated and disappeared instantaneously. I watched them for about 10 seconds before they disappeared. They gave the impression of tremendous power and speed.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document containing descriptive text and a diagram or diagram-like elements.

We went to mr... We were only on the scene for a short time. We drove straight up and... a flying object... When we got up there... the object. There was a search light. Thems something like they could be on a plane. I have a little son about... but i can't tell you about... that on the other field...

The diagram portion of the image contains various labels and numbers, but without more context, I cannot confidently interpret their meaning.

The image does not contain any photographs or visual content. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

The text in the document is as follows:

The circular object appeared without any sound, hovering straight up above the treetops. I have watched them recurve in the sky before and suddenly disappear.

None were seen on this date. Intense light was observed moving back and forth in a straight line without sound. Duration 3-5 minutes.

Thank you.
