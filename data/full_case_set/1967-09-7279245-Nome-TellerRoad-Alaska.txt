PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14
CASE 1967-09-7279245
NOME - TELLER ROAD, ALASKA
SEPTEMBER 7, 1967

The document describes an incident that occurred on September 7, 1967 along the Nome-Teller Road in Alaska. It states that the witness observed a bright light in the sky that appeared to be a "ball of fire and seemed to come towards us." The light was described as being at an angle of 45 degrees and seemed to come closer to the witness. The document mentions that the witness considered the incident with each other and that they felt it was unusual and that they did not know what to make of it.

The text of the document is as follows:

"I was driving south on the Teller Road near Nome, Alaska on September 7, 1967. As I was driving I noticed a bright light in the sky a few miles ahead of me. At first I thought it might be an airplane but as I got closer I could see that it was not an airplane. The object was hovering over the road about 50 feet above the ground. As I got within a quarter mile of the object, it began to move and accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared. 
The object was round in shape and appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. It gave off a bright white light that illuminated the area around it. I have been quite sure of the size of a small room as it hovered over the road. If it is possible to see this at close range I think it is quite possible for me to have a good estimate of its size."

The handwritten text in the image states:
The object was moving very slowly, about the speed of a commercial jet, and travelling in a straight line. It was a very bright light, much brighter than any star or planet. It seemed to be about the size of a full moon. It was at an altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet, and appeared to be about 10 miles distant. I observed it for approximately 10 minutes before it disappeared from view. I feel this sighting could not be explained as any conventional aircraft. It seemed to be a very unusual and unexplainable phenomenon.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch is a compass-like diagram with directional labels such as NW, NE, SE, and SW. The text below the diagram describes it as "the position of the phenomenon when first seen and at the interval of observation", indicating that the diagram is meant to illustrate the movement or position of some phenomenon over time.

The second set of sketches appears to show a person standing on a road or path, with a landscape or horizon visible in the background. The text below these sketches indicates that they are meant to "connect the 'a' and 'b' with a line to indicate the movement of the phenomenon between 'a' and 'b'".

As for the text from the document:
