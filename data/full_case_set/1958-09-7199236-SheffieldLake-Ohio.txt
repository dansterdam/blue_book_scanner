Text extracted from the document:

She called to her husband who also saw the object, but could not identify it. About five minutes later she looked for the object again, and found that it had shifted its position in a westerly direction. She does not remember seeing the moon even though she did look for it. She describes the sky as clear.  The object did not seem to be the source of the light which illuminated the room. According to the witness, the object was 2 inches wide at a distance of 14 inches.

By using similar triangles the size of the object was estimated to be about 22 feet in diameter. Her first estimate was 12 feet, but later she said that it appeared about 1/3 the length of her front yard, which is 65 feet, from house to street. This would confirm the 22 feet figure.

On the same morning, about 2 am, a Mrs. Lorain, watched a "big red ball" moving outside her window. See fig. 5. The object made a low pulsating sound which made the witness "sick to my stomach." She thought at first that the light was due to a train or possibly a truck. A railroad runs one block north of the house. The witness was lying in a bed, with her head about 15 feet from the window, which is two feet across, and she said that the object took up the entire width of the window. When it appeared nearest to the window the witness thought it was giving off heat. The sound connected with the object diminished and decreased as the object advanced and receded. An examination of the trees outside the window disclosed nothing peculiar, even though the object must have passed through some light branches. The witness thinks she heard a crashing sound when the object first appeared.

'Saucer' Terrifies Housewife
From First Page
From that point on, his account of the incident agreed substantially with that of his wife.
Both are said that the "saucer" made a whirring noise. Then, as it left, the noise took on a muffled, whining sound.
John demonstrated with how the "saucer" increasing in pitch, together with a hum.
The "saucer" was described as round from a top or bottom view and oval from a side view. It was about eight feet in diameter, they said, and about three feet high.
It had two openings on both sides in which she saw a series of small tubes like small exhaust pipes, the Sheffield Lake Police Chief said.

Flying Saucers on Top of D.acula, Terrifies Sheffield Lake Woman
Mrs. Alleta D. Anthony, local housewife, and her husband were watching the sky for several minutes and finally Mrs. Anthony called her husband's attention to a hovering glowing object in the sky. She described it as being "a flying saucer". Her husband, who was skeptical at first, soon became convinced that it was indeed a "flying saucer" as his wife had described. Mrs. Anthony, terrified by the experience, a Sheffield Lake housewife and her husband watched the object for more than five minutes through the bedroom window. The object glowed a brilliant white color and then disappeared gradually from view, leaving a cloud of white smoke or vapor in its wake. Mrs. Anthony, greatly aroused from her bed, aroused her husband and together they watched the strange phenomenon. Mrs. Anthony, an unemployed truck driver, claimed the experience as her own. She said she was still shaken up the following the experience. It is the first of its kind in this area. The object hovered a foot above the highest point of their home and was a metallic, circular craft from which purplish smoke from the saucers back and sides. It remained for about two minutes before ascending and disappearing into the sky.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Rep. A. D. Baumhart
House of Representatives 
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Baumhart:

You no doubt have read the accounts of my experience with a "flying saucer" on the morning of Sept. 21. Articles appeared in the Lorain Journal and Plain Dealer. I have sent a summary of the sighting to the Air Force UFO Center in Dayton, Ohio.

Will you please check with the Air Force to find out their conclusion in this case?

If these objects are landing in populated areas, it will not be long before disaster strikes. This is definitely a menace to ordinary people. So if this was a government missile, can you stop them from being flown in populated areas? If it did not belong to our government, this fact should be made public, and proper steps should be taken to insure the public safety.

I have talked to people who have investigated similar sightings. These people tell me that usually no real investigation is made by the Air Force, and when one is made the results are ridiculous.

I would not have written this letter if I did not feel sincerely that the matter must be studied closely by authorities. The object which came down in my yard had no business there, under any circumstances.

DRAFT 21 Oct.

Dear Mr. Baumgart:

I refer to your inquiry concerning the interest of Mrs. (redacted) of Sheffield Lake, Ohio, concerning an unidentified flying object she saw on 21 September 1958.

Air Force investigators arrived in Sheffield, Ohio, on 3 October 1958, contacted Mrs. (redacted) and also initiated other phases of an investigation to possibly evaluate this sighting.

Investigation revealed that a railroad track ran near the home of Mrs. (redacted). The right of way of this track was sighting a train passed the house at approximately the same hour of the reported sighting. The train had a rotating headlight which under some conditions would produce unusual effects.

Contact was also made with Chief Bosun Mate William Schott of the Lorain Coast Guard Station. Chief Schott reported that he was using his spotlight in an attempt to attract the attention of another ship, and that the light was directed toward shore in the general direction of Mrs. (redacted) house. The time and date of this incident coincide with those reported by Mrs. (redacted). Mrs. (redacted) of Lorain, Ohio, a witness listed in Mrs. (redacted) report, couldn't recall anything unusual on the night of the reported sighting. Mr. (redacted), another witness of Lorain, Ohio, was not available for interview. The weather at the time of the incident was a misty rain with haze and smoke.

Conclusion of Air Force investigators were that the combination of moving lights, noise of the train and prevailing weather account for the illusion experienced by Mrs. (redacted). The Air Technical Intelligence Center, after evaluating the evidence in this case, concurred with the conclusion of the investigators.

Dear Sir:
This is a request for the official conclusion on my UFO report.
My sighting took place on September 21, 1958, at my home in Sheffield Lake, Ohio. It was investigated on October 3 and 4 by Sgt. Hof and Sgt. Haistad, both of the Air Technical Intelligence Center.
I was assured by the sergeants that the conclusion would be available to me within thirty days. They also said that if the case is in the "known" category I will be furnished with the evidence which indicated that conclusion.
Please send the conclusion as soon as possible.

Sincerely,

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing a UFO sighting that occurred in Sheffield Lake, Ohio on September 21, 1958.

The text in the document is as follows:

UFO SIGHTING
SHEFFIELD LAKE, OHIO
21 September 1958

On the morning of 21 September 1958 at approximately 0300 EDT, the witness was awakened by a very bright light which illuminated her bedroom. Looking out a bedroom window which faced her front yard, she saw a flat, circular object with a dome-shaped top. The object was approximately 60 to 80 feet in diameter, and it was moving slowly in a pendant, descending motion. The object was reported to be accompanied by a floating oscillating motion. The object was reported to be approximately 50 to 75 feet above the house.

In Summary, the investigation revealed that a railroad track ran near the home of Mrs. X. Contact with Mr. X's station master at Lorain, Ohio, revealed that a train had passed the witness's home at approximately the same time as the reported sighting. This train had an illuminated headlight, and this light could have been seen by Mrs. X. Contact was also made with the Officer-In-Charge at the Lorain Coast Guard Station. The chief reported that he was using his spotlight to attract the attention of another ship, and that this light was directed toward the location of the incident. This time element was found to coincide with those reported by Mrs. X. Mrs. X of Lorain, Ohio, was contacted but was unable to recall anything on the night of the reported sighting. Mrs. Z, another witness of Lorain, Ohio was not available for interview.

The weather at the time of the sighting was intermittent mist and rain, which has some subtle effect. Weather is always an important factor because of its direct effects, and the fact that it often allows for indirect conclusions (i.e., when, where, and how).

Investigation further indicates that Mrs. X received letters from other self-appointed UFO experts concerning her sighting. These letters inferred that Mrs. X may have received harmon in some way, and were toned for encouragement to Mrs. X and all directed toward discrediting the U.S. Government and psychologically the Air Force.

The Air Force conclusion in this case is that Mrs. X and her step-son were illuminated from the combination of lights from the train and possibly the Coast Guard boat, the roar from the engine, and the prevailing weather conditions. It is not uncommon for the senses to be stimulated under such conditions, resulting in aberrant visual and auditory impressions.

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

Your letter of 29 October 1958, addressed to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base concerning an unidentified flying object sighting on 21 September at Sheffield Lake, Ohio, has been referred to this office for reply.

The conclusion of Air Force investigators were that the combination of moving lights, the noise of a train and the prevailing weather at the time accounted for the sighting experienced by you that night.

November 27, 1958

Dear Major Tacker:

Would you kindly specify what moving lights caused me to see an object 25 feet in diameter and 6 feet high hovering in my front yard? Our reference to the prevailing weather has also convinced me that the object hovered in the report form that it had stopped raining some time before the sighting. I would appreciate it very much if you would explain these matters to me in a little more detail.

Sincerely,
Mrs. [Redacted]

Performing optical character recognition on the text in the document, the output is as follows:

UFO Sighting. Mrs. (Sheffield Lake, Ohio)

1. Is in evident to the only explanation available to the so-called private UFO investigators, is that she saw a "space ship".  To these individuals, including Mrs. , she saw a "flying saucer" and nothing we can say will change their way of thinking.  

2. According to the Lorain Coast Guard Station log, the weather throughout the early morning of 21 September 1958 was alternately misting and raining.

Just prior to, or after, her sighting she decided to check with her neighbors to see if they had observed a similar object.  It was determined a train did pass in the neighborhood at about the time of her sighting, having a headlight that made a figure eight oscillation.

4. AUTO retains its original position to stand on the conclusions in this case. Mrs. 's story is not accepted and the victim or on the failure.

I had just gone to bed when I this incident when I was light turned on in the window. As the light went out I looked out and saw this object moving northwest across the front yard. The object crossed the clearing and left sight behind the trees. The light crossed the doorway becoming dimmer as it moved and brighter as it came toward it. The object moved at a terrific rate of speed. As it moved across the clearing I could see the outline of the object, dark against the sky. The lights were not glowing as it moved away. The object made no noise. The lights on it were a pale reddish-white color, about the size of a 10-watt light bulb. If some sort - anil as it move.

5 January 1959

Dr. 
Cambridge 38, Mass.

Dear Dr. 

You and your family have my hopes for a happy and successful New Year.

In our earlier telephone conversation I promised to send you a weekly summary of our activities, but after further thought I feel a bi-monthly summary would be sufficient, supplemented by telephone calls. Any questions or suggestions you have, will, of course, receive my earliest convenience.

There has been some time since you have been brought up to date. On 28 December 1958, the outstanding case of the last three months of 1958, the case of the Flying Object photographed over the Sheffield Lake, Ohio area on 21 September 1958, may be obtained from the enclosed chart covering the last six months of 1958.

080002, 21 September 1958, Sheffield Lake, Ohio
A housewife was awakened by an intense bright light in her bedroom. She stated to a neighbor that position on the bed and from her window viewed an object which she described as round (saucer-like) approximately twenty feet in diameter. In addition, she stated that she first sighted the object following objects made several oscillations in her front yard approximately six feet from the ground, and then disappeared straight upward at a very high speed. The witness stated that the object was humming and whirring.

The Air Force investigators on the case discovered two light sources which were on the ground, some distance from the location of the witness' house. It appears this light was caused by the reflection of the object on the water of Lake Erie. The Air Force investigator's opinion is that the object sighted should be classified as "hoax or phenomenon" because of the inconsistencies in the witness' statements and the conditional fact that the weather at the time of the sighting was extremely mist and rain with smoke and haze. An acoustic and the additional fact, the witness watched a "horror movie" (Twilight Zone) before retiring. And finally, the witness had a history of mental disturbance.

WAR probably emotionally vurnerable; led the ATIC to conclude that the witness was a victim of an illusion.

03222. 26 September 1958. Columbus, Miss, to Atlanta, Ga.
Object described as a bright ball of fire with a tail and moving at a very high rate of speed, two of the 3 witnesses estimated the speed to be 4,000 to 5,000 mph. This object was viewed for approximately 10-15 seconds and disappeared. The ATIC concluded this object was an illusion.

03232. 29 September 1958. Washington, D. C. to Pittsburgh, Pa. 
Object described as a bright ball of fire and flashing; with a trail; was reported to be moving at a very high rate of speed. This object was witnessed by several people and was reported to have struck the ground or landed in both the Washington, D. C. area and the Pittsburgh area.
The ATIC concluded this object was a meteor.

63970. 26 October 1958. Lock Haven Dam (Baltimore), Md.
Object described by six witnesses as a bright red-orangish object estimated by the witnesses to be approximately 550 yards, but which investigation showed was only one-half to one mile away. They saw an object flashing and pulsating. The witnesses estimated the size of the object to be approximately 100 feet in diameter. In about 30 to 60 seconds, the object pulsed out and the motor went dead. Both witnesses got out of the car and were surrounded by a bluish glow. This was accompanied by a thunder-like sound from the object. The object then pulsed back on and within ten seconds it had completely disappeared. The witnesses were then able to start their car and proceed to St. Joseph's Hospital in Baltimore for a physical examination. 

The ATIC is presently chasing down the possibility of an escaped patient from a mental institution. This would leave a conclusive account of this case unrecovered.

17552. 28 October 1958. Charleston, S. C. to Savannah, Ga.
Object described as a bright burning ball falling from the sky. Weather clear with 15 miles visibility. The ATIC concluded this was a meteor.

Sincerely,
Robert J. Friend
Chief of Satatistics

1. Reference the questions outlined in AFCIN-HEEAE Ltr of 7 December 1958, to M/Sgt. Fisher - The ATIC will not recommend any disciplinary action be taken against the investigators. The ATIC feels the investigation was adequate and intense and rejects no recommendations or implications made by the investigators being prepared for presentation to the Commander of ATIC for this study does not propose administrative or other Air Force action - this study was in no sense prompted by this case.
2. Enclosures: One copy of "Investigative Report," dated 13 September 1958, published by the UFO Research Committee of NICAP, containing detailed statements and information on the Sheffield Lake, Ohio, incident of September 11, 1958. This report indicates paragraphs dealing with the specific charges will substantiate the competence of the investigators.
21 September 1958 and the conclusions and/or contradictions in "The Investigative Report," dated 21 September 1958, and published by the UFO Research Committee of NICAP, Ohio are a matter of opinion. The incidents cited there are a (Page 1) No mention of the horror movie (Dracula's Daughter) which the witness was viewing just before the sighting, is in the opinion of the ATIC that this was a contributing factor to the emotional vulnerability of Mrs. (Page 2) Witness mentioned for the search time that window curtains were made of heavy cloth.
3. (Page 2) The investigators did inform Mrs. (name redacted) that approximately thirty (30) days would be required for the Air Force to get an answer to her. However, they made no statement on how long it would take to obtain the answer of the investigation which would be made available.
4. (Page 3) T/Sgt Haisten questioned Mrs. (name redacted) for approximately two hours. During the questioning Mrs. (name redacted) of the UFO Research Committee were not present. T/Sgt Haisten points out that many more questions could have been asked if those listed members of the Committee had been present.
5. (Page 3) The Air Force investigators did not make a house to house check in the neighborhood. It has already been pointed out that these men have considerable experience and are capable of conducting an adequate investigation without the necessity of continuing investigation at additional expense.
6. (Page 3 & 4) It is assumed that Mrs. (name redacted) was contacted by the Air Force investigators and indicated that nothing unusual occurred in the vicinity of her home prior to the sighting.

(Page 4) The investigators advised that no one was home at the house. Contact would certainly have been made with Mrs. McEntee. (Case 6) The fact that this object was seen by another person from approximately the same vantage point does not rule out the illusion. The same illusion can be experienced by two people independently.

1. (Page 6) In obtaining a description of the item Mr.___ admitted to the Air Force investigators that he was drawing from Blue Book for comparison. Smell is under that there is similarity between her description and the item in Blue Book.

The train time indicated here is not specified as EST or EDT. The Air Force investigator's record indicates a train left the station at 2:32 EDT (3:52 EST) or 52 minutes after the sighting.

(Page 8) The investigators point out that approximately 100 feet of track can be seen from the location and that the train light would not permit identification.

6. (Page 8) The primary job of Haislen and Hof is investigation; they may or may decide that the examination of the file is required. The responsibility for the analysis of all UFO cases lies with the ATIC. In no instance should investigators assume a confidential publication on Air Force representatives.

h. (Page 8) The Air Force conclusion stated that it was a combination of the lights which are responsible for the illusion formed by observers. This is possibly the result of an aircraft lighting the clouds.

The following statements align themselves with the alleged charges of blunders committed by the investigators and/or ATIC:

a. The investigators indicate that the light can be seen from Mrs. ___'s window.

b. There was no claim that the light was reflected from clouds but was possibly shown as the source from the house and found to concentrate the impossibility of the light shining on Mrs. ___'s house.

c. The impression of the investigators is that the light is of the object, light as chief Schott's ship is of the object, and that this light could not be seen clearly enough.

d. Mrs. ___ did admit seeing a red glow on the night of the sighting; however, she attributes this to reflections from the Ohio Edison plant to the WNW of her home. It is to note that Mrs. ___'s home is approximately 3 miles to the west and the plant is some distance to the WNW.

"No one was home to be contacted at the uego house. 

The report plays with words here. What is visible is water vapor or rain of very small particles. Ori tional investigation from the house of G. E. Sheffield was also made. There was no specific claim that the smoke came from the U. S. Steel Company plant."

(2) Test Harrison obtained a model made of paper plates and a bowl which was shown to the sergeants along with a verbal description.

(4) The sergeants did take notes during the investigation and interview. However, it should be noted that the terrain interefered and the interviewers did not feel they were to go on record as this thing since there is no record requiring exact record on their part in the future.

(5) The ATIC feels that definite steps are should be pointed out that the apparent purpose of the UFO Research Committee, like most private organizations, is to disorganize the U.S. Government's and public's impression.

(6) The UFO Research Committee is claimed to be a scientific organization. However, there are no indications of a high level of credibility within the organization.

(7) The ATIC stands firmly behind the investigators in this case. True, there were some physical changes in the area, but could have occurred from normal activity. The collected evidence was sufficient for the Air Force when in the judgment of these experienced men the collected evidence was significant.

1. On 1 October 1958, the Air Technical Intelligence Center received a letter from the USAF Office of Sheffield, Ohio, concerning a report of her UFO sighting on 21 September 1958, and action was initiated on this date to have the case investigated.

2. Mrs. ___ stated in her report that on the morning of 21 September 1958, she was awakened by a very bright light which illuminated her bedroom at approximately 0300 EDT. Looking out of a bedroom window which faced her front yard, she saw an object about the size and color of a dome-shaped automobile. It hovered above the ground at an estimated height of about 40 feet and remained in this position for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The object was observed to be about the size of a small car, and during the time it was under observation it made several turns around the yard and then rose instantly out of sight. Total time of observation was estimated as five minutes.

3. Air Force investigators arrived in Sheffield, Ohio on 3 October 1958, conducted Mrs. ___ and also initiated other phases of the investigation. Mrs. ___ advised that at all interviews was advised by Mrs. ___ to be a member of a local NICAP organization.

UFO sighting, Sheffield Lake, Ohio (CT[REDACTED])
SAFHI-2 ATIC: Maj. L. J. Tacker
ATIC-6-2 
On 7 October 1958, the Air Technical Intelligence Center received a letter from Mr. CR 3, the author of the incident, reporting a sighting of an unidentified flying object. Action was initiated by the ATIC on this date to have this sighting investigated by the 1002nd AICS.
On 21 September 1950, the witness was awakened by a very bright light which illuminated her bedroom. This light was elliptical in shape and about six feet in diameter, appearing approximately six to eight feet from the ground, moving slowly in a northerly direction towards the water. The object was approximately five to eight feet from the ground. The witness observed the object from the window for several minutes. At this time she saw two tail-light type lights on the sides of the object. These lights appeared to be amber in color and emitted a pulsating glow. The object moved slowly over the water and appeared to be approximately six feet in diameter and approximately six feet thick. The item was reported to have made several turns around the area and was estimated to have lasted 15-20 minutes.
The Air Force investigators arrived in Sheffield Lake, Ohio on 3 October 1959.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"1. The general procedure used in the investigation of this case was to summarize the testimony of the witness, obtain other. witnesses, both for and against the sight ings, observe the physical layout, search for possible conditions which could be responsible for the sighting, and to exam the general background of the case.

2. In summary the investigation reveals that a radioed track received at Lorain, Ohio, revealed that a train passed the location at the time of the sighting. This information, it is felt, could have been seen by the witness and taken to have been a UFO. Contact was also made with Chief Warrant Officer K.B. Scott, Chief Navigator of the Lorain Control Tower, who stated that his attention was directed toward another ship and that his lights was directed toward shore at the time the sighting was reported.

3. However, 2 other witnesses, both residents of Lorain, Ohio were contacted, but was unable to recall anything unusual or out of the ordinary having taken place at the time the sighting was reported.

4. The weather at the time of the sighting was intermittent mist and rain with low ceilings as indicated by the Chief Warrant Officer. This, it is felt, was an important factor because of its direct effects and the fact that it is often allows for illusion conditions to develop.

5. The Air Force investigators expressed the Air Force investigators as being nervous and emotional, and indicative of a a highly nervous and emotional nature which probably contributed to her emotional states.

6. Investigators further disclosed that Mrs. had received letters from other self-appointed UFO experts concerning her sighting. There has been some sentiment directed toward discrediting the U.S. Government and particularly the Air Force. (Dated J. C. P.)

7. Members to the Air Technical Intelligence Center were informed that the letter and report which has been prepared concerning this case has been forwarded to you as requested by your letter dated 23 October 1958.

8. The investigators, Capt. J. A. Haislen and T/Sgt. V. P. Rolf, state that the entire investigation since 7 September 1958 and it was concluded."

The image contains a photograph that depicts two people, a man and a woman, examining what appears to be a mock-up or model of a "saucer" or UFO object. The photograph is accompanied by a caption that identifies the people as Mrs. William H. Fitzgerald and John Fitzgerald, and states that they are the Sheffield Lake family examining the "saucer".

'Saucer' Terrifies Housewife
Clarence E. Hambly said he was not notified of the sighting and had no reports from anyone.
Both also said that the "saucer" made a whirring sound.
Then, as it left, the "saucer" made a sound like a whistle, increasing in pitch, together with a hum.
Not seen by others, the "saucer" was described as round from a top or bottom view and oval from a side view with a rounded top. It was about eight feet in diameter, they said, and about three feet high.
Mrs. Fitzgerald said it had openings on both sides in which she saw a series of small tubes "like small exhaust pipes."

RESEARCH ON Unidentified Flying Objects
By Lillian Crowner Deguln
Bob Adkins of WTYN radio is responsible for bringing this item to the attention of the press. In his Monday morning newscast he mentioned it. This was in the Sheffield Lake, Ohio, Herald of Sheffield Lake, Ohio.
Feeling that this event deserves wide-spread discussion, I put in a long distance call to get further details.
A follow-up shows that there is a house here that is certainly the scene of development where there are unusual things going on. There is an elderly couple living in this modest bungalow-type home. She had gone to bed, and he was still up watching television.
Suddenly the drapes blew apart with such intensity that she was forced to get up and close the windows. When the light returned to normal, they saw the large light beam in her pillow. The light faded out and than flashed on again. Mrs. Fitzgerald knew something unusual was happening.
Not being much good on guessing, she did not know what to give this strange light name. How powerful it was can be judged from the fact that it lit up her bedroom about eight feet in diameter and three feet through. The circular plates placed edge to edge around it was ground with a non-glittering, It was a soft sort of luminescence that gave off a grayish hue. Mrs. Fitzgerald said the light was sufficient to show off.

Flying Saucers on Top of Dracula. Terrifies Sheffield Lake Woman
BY ALLEN P. ASHBOLT
What could be more terrifying than a real life encounter with a "flying saucer"? Mrs. Fitzgerald, a Sheffield Lake housewife, was treated to this unique experience, and says it was "the most horrible thing that has ever happened to me."
Mrs. Fitzgerald was awoke one night last week by a brilliant white glare that filled her bedroom. Looking out, she saw two flying saucers hovering over the house next door. Her immediate reaction was to hide under the bed covers. "I was too frightened to move", she said.
The objects remained motionless for more than five minutes, then suddenly shot straight up into the sky with an incredibly bright light trail. "It was as though a thousand light bulbs were turned on at once", said Mrs. Fitzgerald.
After the departure of the strange craft, Mrs. Fitzgerald got up and went to the window to get a better look. She noticed that the neighbor's house was bathed in a strange green light that seemed to come from the hovering objects. "The light was so bright that it closed the bedroom drapes through the windows. The objects themselves were then visible and seemed to be about twenty-five feet in diameter."
Mrs. Fitzgerald said she became hysterical and had to be given a sedative by her son, who is a graduate student at Baldwin-Wallace College.
Since the experience, Mrs. Fitzgerald has been extremely nervous and upset. "I just don't know what to think. I've always been a practical person and I never believed in flying saucers before. Now I'm not so sure."

Monday Eve.-

Dear Mrs. -----,

I have written up your story for this weeks paper, and if I do not find that you have sent for a subscription will send you a clipping. Because you asked me to let you know if they printed and they have asked me to make no noise but now and then they do, so it is quite important. ALSO I'm wondering whether the Air Force or anyone will get to you and suggest you do not give out your story. This happens, and I'll surely appreciate it if you will keep me informed. If do wish we had time for me to go into the matter more fully, but I find that generally no one believes you anyway, so it's almost useless.

Am almost tempted to drive up to see you as yours is one of the best sightings. Do let me hear from you on any points you have forgotten to mention, no matter how slight. Sometimes they have more importance than you think.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

Investigation revealed that a railroad track ran near the home of Mrs. she stated that the night of the incident she had seen a light of some sort go past her house, she stated this light passed her house in approximate the same hour of the incident, but she could not associate this light as being related to the incident in any way. Contact was also made with Chief Redun G. State William Dauch of Sheffield Lake, Ohio who stated he had no information concerning the sighting of the strange aerial objecv and that the residents of the area were not the object of attention of another ship, and that the light was directed toward shore in the general direction of the hoan.

The text in the document is as follows:

"SIGHTING: The reporting was about a sighting to some to our attention in a town called Sheffield Lake, Ohio, that occurred on Sept 10. According to the local newspapers, a number of residents watched a flying object at very close range for more than five minutes. Mrs. Pauline Phillips had roused her from her bed, she was awakened by a flickering light. She looked out of her second-floor window and saw a strange, glowing object that appeared to be about a foot above her neighbor's driveway. It was circular in shape and the interior of the object emitted a bluish-gray purplish smoke. it seems there were in a hurry to move form lawn, and rose to about several feet. The object then made a downward motion, made circular maneuvers, and shot straight up at a fantastic speed. The two girls, a husband and daughter, were steadily watching the next door room. The object made a swooping motion and seemed to shake and tremble as it approached the house. The report shows the sighting satisfied the object to the facts,and if this is typical of their investigation procedures, it is not easy to see how they are now convinced over 952 of sightings.

The image contains a photograph depicting a description of a UFO sighting incident. The text mentions that the witness, Mrs. Fitzgerald, saw a "disk-shaped object with a hump in the middle, a dull aluminum in color, was moving across the yard at a height of about five feet." The object did not glow and did not have lights on it. It moved north across the neighbor's yard and then came to a stop, floating motionless for several seconds while pink-gray smoke billowed out from two openings in the rim and illuminated the UFO. Each opening contained seven pipes. The text also describes the witness's experiences after the sighting, including her husband's reaction and the subsequent news coverage.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF
Galley 103-The world of flying saucers gated. She enclosed a three-page summary prepared by members of the UFO Research Committee of Akron, and added, "I assume this matter if some action is not taken soon to explain it."
The alleged UFO had appeared at about 3 A.M. in the yard of the one-story, two-bedroom house occupied by Mrs. Fitzgerald and her husband. She had been sitting up alone watching TV. The bedroom window was shut and the window curtains were closed. Outside, the night was dark; the moon had set, there were no street lights.
Lying with her arm over her eyes, trying to get to sleep, she suddenly realised that the room was illuminated and stood up on the bed to look out of the window. According to her account, a disk-shaped object with a hump in the middle, a dull aluminum in color, was moving across the yard at a height of about five feet. The object did not glow and did not have lights on it. It moved north across the neighbor's yard, and then came to a stop, floating motionless for several seconds while pink-gray smoke billowed out from two openings in the rim and illuminated the UFO. Each opening contained seven pipes. The object then moved on across the neighbor's yard. After about fifty feet, it stopped and floated motionless for several seconds, while pink-gray smoke again poured out from the rim and illuminated the UFO. Each opening contained seven pipes. The object then moved quickly back into her yard, rising to a height of five feet. No longer emitting smoke, it made two quick clockwise turns with a radius of about three feet, and then moved up over the roof of the house, putting out of sight over the window. She cut if off from further view. During the entire time of the sighting, about thirty seconds, she had heard a muffled noise like that of an electric motor. When the object had gone, the room returned to darkness. Her husband, by kicking her, but without success. When the object had gone, the went back to bed and slept.
When she woke at 11:00 the next morning and mentioned her experience to the family, she learned that ten-year-old John, asleep in the second bedroom, had also seen a strange light. He had apparently wakened during the night to go to the bathroom and had returned to bed when he saw the bright light. It was so unusual and lasted some considerable time before going off.
Puzzled by the incident, Mrs. Fitzgerald telephoned the local director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, who in turn notified the Air Force investigators. Yet she threatened to notify her congressman unless some action were taken soon. She had not waited for action, however, but by the same mail had written to her congressman requesting him to obtain an explanation from the Air Force.
Members of the Akron Committee, one of whom lived in the nearby town of Lorain, soon arrived to question his experience; other incidents in Lorain were reported to have seen the same UFO.
Even at first glance, the situation presented several unusual factors. Though Mrs. Fitzgerald's story was a detailed and sober one, the Air Force investigators, yet she threatened to notify her congressman unless some action were taken soon. She had not waited for action, however, but by the same mail had written to her congressman requesting him to obtain an explanation from the Air Force.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 103--The world of flying saucers ended. She enclosed a three-page summary prepared by members of the UFO Research Committee of Akron, and stated: 'I assure you that I will contend to your chairman about this matter if some action is not soon to explain it.'

The alleged UFO had appeared at about 3 a.m. in the yard of the one-story, two-bedroom house occupied by Mrs. Fitzgerald and her husband, who was asleep, and had gone to bed at the end of the late movie. The bedroom windows were shut and the window curtains were closed. Outside, the night was dark, the moon had set, there were no street lights, and some of the neighbors' houses were lighted. Lying with her arm over her husband, trying to sleep, she suddenly realized that the room was illuminated and stood up on the bed to look out of the window.

Looking out, she saw moving across the yard a dull-shaped object with a hump in the middle, a dull aluminum in color, was moving across the yard at a height of about five feet. The object did not glow and did not have lights on it, she could not determine the source of the illumination. About twenty-five feet in diameter, it was moving north across the driveway into a neighbor's yard, losing altitude on the way until it was only some six feet above the ground. At a distance of fifty feet or less, it was moving slowly, without noise, to the north across the yard until it passed behind some trees and vegetation and was no longer seen. While pink-gray smoke billowed out from two openings in the craft and illuminated the UFO. Each opening contained seven pipes. The smoke did not come from the pipes but was projected, it was stopped. The object then moved back into the witness's yard, rising but without emitting smoke, it made two quick clockwise turns with a radius of about three feet, and rose straight up. The rose rising straight up to about thirty feet, hovering, about thirty-six seconds, she had heard a muffled noise like that of a jet engine warming up. She had tried several times to waken her husband, but he would not awaken. When the object moved further away, she went back to bed and slept. The next morning and mentioned her experience to the family, she learned that ten-year-old John Fitzgerald, a nephew living in the second bedroom, had also been awakened during the night to go to the bathroom and had returned to bed, when he saw a 'bright light shining into his room and heard an unusual noise.' Climbing up on the bed, he observed the object as it hovered over the yard.

After watching for a few seconds, the light had gone. He went to bed until to sleep. Puzzled by the incident, Mrs. Fitzgerald telephoned the local newspaper, the Lorain Journal, and the story appeared in several Akron, Ohio, papers. Members of the Akron UFO Research Committee, one of whom lived in the nearby town of Lorain, soon arrived to question her and prepare the summary of her experience; other witnesses in the area were also interviewed.

Text from the document:

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 104—THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
4. Other factors: (a) Between midnight at 4 A.M., a Coast Guard cutter equipped with an eight-inch spotlight had been flying low and forth on Lake Erie searching for an overdue cabin cruiser. At 4:15 A.M., the cutter had headed east toward Lorrain, reaching there at 4:15, had then continued east beyond Sheffield to Avon, before turning back to the Lorrain Highway station and reporting. 
During the time the cutter had been so engaged, a train had left the Lorrain railroad station. 
About the time the train passed roughly three miles from the Fitzgerald house, eight minutes later the object would have been passing south of the house at a distance of about 100 yards. The engine was using a wood burning stove to produce sufficient steam to go against the strong wind blowing from there that produced the probable course of the UFO. In the hour or so before the sighting, the witness had been setting up alone watching the late show on TV. The film that night was a horror movie, Dracula's Daughter.
Soon after the witness had gone to bed, the Coast Guard cutter on Lake Erie was traveling east toward Lorrain, was very near the harbor and was flashing its searchlight toward the two bedrooms of the Fitzgerald house, and this may have attracted attention toward shore. (b) At the Fitzgerald house and had aroused Mrs. Fitzgerald. At that hour four miles distant from the Fitzgerald house, the beam would have been spread and would have been dispersed still more by the rain falling by the time. Mrs. Fitzgerald reached her window and pulled the light curtains. The searchlight was gone. At the same time, however, the train that left Lorrain at 4:35 was passing south of the house, giving its headlight and producing a roaring atmosphere. Looking through the wet glass of the window, the witness saw the beam of the train headlight moving through the haze in the yard. Smoke from the nearby foundry was also being illuminated by the circular beam of light as the smoke seemed to be a glowing, solid object that moved back and forth and emitted clouds of gray-pink smoke.
In summary, the Air Force concluded that Mrs. Fitzgerald's UFO sighting was induced by a combination of factors in question the frame of mind induced by Dracula's Daughter, the spotlight on the Coast Guard cutter, the rotating headlight of the train, and the noise of its engine, the smoke from the foundry and the haze of the mist in the yard.
This analysis provided an explanation from the witness, who wrote her congressman: "I was outraged when I read the Air Force conclusion to my sighting. The person who made it must be a blithering idiot."

"The Fitzgerald Report"
The UFO Research Committee compiled and on December 1 published a Reinterpreted pamphlet later released in amplified form and copyrighted) entitled: "The Fitzgerald Report". This detailed the account of the Sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object at Sheffield Lake, Ohio, on September 21, 1958. This document charged "duplicity" in the Air Force treatment of UFO reports in general, and asserted that the Fitzgerald investigation in this case had been a whitewash.

Transcription of the text:

"Came 2:14 a.m. to 2:45 a.m. A Coast Guard cutter equipped with an eight-inch spotlight had been flying back and forth in Lake Erie searching for an overdue cabin cruiser. At about 4 a.m. the cutter had been headed east toward Lorain, reaching there at 5:15, but this continued case beyond Sheffield as daylight approached. The Coast Guard cutter returned to its lifeboat station and bringing a 4 a.m. (b) At 5:55 a.m. a train had left the Lorain railroad station, crossing this route while continuing past Sheffield house. Eight minutes later the train had passed within about 100 yards. The engine was using a rotating headlight.

From these facts, it was possible to reconstruct the probable sequence of events:
At about 4 a.m. the cutter's spotlight, while searching for the overdue cabin cruiser, illuminated the area near the sighting. The witness had been sitting up alone watching the late movie on TV. The film that night was a horror movie, Dracula's Daughter. About 5 a.m., soon after the witness had gone to bed, the Coast Guard cutter on Lake Erie was traveling toward shore. The light had briefly illuminated the two bedrooms of the Fitzgerald home and had caused Mrs. Fitzgerald, a light sleeper, to investigate. Going to the window, she had observed the spotlighted cutter and was reaching to pull down the curtains when the searchlight was gone. At the same time, however, the train that left Lorain at 5:55 was passing causing a noise produced by the spotlight and producing a roaring noise made more piercing by the moist atmosphere. Looking through the wet panes of the window, the witness saw the bright light moving through the haze in the shaft of smoke from the nearby foundry was also being blown into the yard. I1luminated by the circular beam of light, the smoke seemed to be a form of gray-pink smoke.

In summarizing, the Air Force concluded that Mrs. Fitzgerald's UFO was an illusion produced by a combination of factors: an excited frame of mind induced by Dracula's Daughter, the spotlighting of the Coast Guard cutter, the approaching headlight of the train and the noise of its engine, the smoke from the nearby steel plant, and the illumination of the nearby night."

The report is titled "The Fitzgerald Report" and it indicates that the UFO Research Committee compiled and published the report on December 1st, which described the sighting of an unidentified flying object in Sheffield Lake, Ohio on September 24, 1958. The report suggests that the sighting was a misidentification caused by a combination of factors rather than an actual UFO.

Charge 1. - THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS.
The nights picturesque up objects in all directions. It is hard to estimate the distance of some of these objects and they snapped on and off during short periods of time.
Charge 1. - The statement that the supposed confirmation of Charge 1 was incorrect. When the investigators visited Mrs. S. she asserted that she had nothing to contribute. At about 3:30 A.M. (Gulf an hour earlier) she noticed a bright-red glow that had startled her at first until she realized that it probably came from the nearby Ohio Bell Telephone plant or from the foundry. The Committee in the December 1957 edition of the document bears no date. The notarized statement used in the 1959 edition is dated March 22, six months after the Air Force interview, apparently. Mrs. S. had changed her mind for reasons unknown.
Charge 2. - The statement by another confirmatory witness, Mr. C., was not available for interview was "pathetic" because it was Mr. C., not Mr. G., who saw the UFO. [The point of this accusation is unclear.] Because of a typographical error in a letter, "Mrs." was changed to "Mr." The fact remains that the supposed witness, Mrs. C., was not available. Also, the flight she reported had appeared.
Charge 6a. It was not true that a misty rain with haze and mist had occurred at the time of the sighting; the witness herself stated that it was not raining. [Incorrect. The Cleveland Weather Bureau recorded continuous light precipitation between 2 and 4:15 A.M. When asked whether it was raining when she saw the UFO, the witness replied, "it had rained a few hours before." A vague response suggesting the rain was not at the time of the sighting.]
Charge 6b. It was not true that smoke from the steel plant southeast of the house could have been a factor in the sighting, because the direction of the wind was wrong. [Incorrect. The Weather Bureau recorded "WSW" winds that night, suggesting that smoke would have blown northeast, directly toward the house.]
Charge 7a. The sergeants did not make a house-to-house check of the neighborhood for other witnesses. [Correct. The neighbors had not two weeks in which to report a visiting spaceship. No such report had been made, even by the neighbor in whose yard the object was supposed to have hovered.]
Charge 7b. They did not ask Mrs. Fitzgerald to make a drawing of the UFO. [Correct. Before their visit she had already made such a drawing, which she presented to the Committee who had shown her a sketch of an alleged spaceship reproduced earlier in an Air Force pamphlet.]

Transcribed text from the document:

The document made a number of specific accusations. Because of the civilian nature of this attack, we shall discuss each point fully, to illustrate the procedures followed by many civilian agencies.

Charge 1: The Coast Guard Coast at Sheffield Lake, Ohio, was a witness to the series of events on this night. The Coast Guard at Station Lake Erie, located in Sheffield Lake, Ohio, did not witness the train's fight shine through the window. The light could have shone into the yard, however, and would have been visible, but no one in the Coast Guard Station saw the light that was stated by a witness to be in the window.

Charge 2: Because of the position of the Fitzgerald house, the lights of the train could have shone into those room windows. The Air Force did not suggest that the train's light shone into the window. The light could have shone into the yard, however, and would have been visible, but no one in the Fitzgerald house saw the light.

Charge 3: Events taking place on the lake could not have had any relation to the sighting because the shore was some 600 yards and trees, a witness in the Fitzgerald house could not see the lake. [Incorrect conclusion from the Coast Guard cutter.]

Charge 4: A beam of a spotlight on a boat moving could have been seen from the house. The beam of such a light could have been seen from the house. The beam of such a light can be visible for great distances. Reflected from the clouds and spread by the drops of moisture in the air, it could easily have flashed into the window of the Fitzgerald house.

Charge 5: The beam of light reported by the Coast Guard cutter was of a type that could not be focused like a searchlight, therefore the beam could not have been reflected from the clouds, as the witness stated. Respect: The spotlight used could operate as either a diffuse or a narrow beam, and could have been reflected from the clouds to the house.

Charge 6: The turning of the beam in the direction of the house only once that night signifies another boat at a time two hours earlier than the sighting and a place roughly five miles from the house. [The December 9, 1957 sighting was 3.5 miles; the statement is incorrect.] A signaling incident did occur at that time and about that place specified, but it had no relation to the house sighting.

In a statement obtained by the Akron Committee itself, the chief boatswain's mate on duty stated that the subject spotlight was flashed on and off a number of times during the search for the missing cabin cruiser.

September 29, 1958
OHIO
Aerial Phenomena Group

Dayton, Ohio
Dear Sirs:
This is to inform you of a UFO sighting I had on September 21, 1958. I would appreciate it very much if you would send an investigator or someone to explain this happening to me. It was a terribly frightening experience.
I assure you that I will contact my congressman about this matter if some action is not taken soon to explain it.
No private citizen should be placed in the path of government devices, if that is what it was. If it was a space craft, steps must be taken to warn the public.
The summary included here was prepared by a private UFO investigator who interviewed me and the other people who reported strange objects that morning.
Sincerely,

The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, an Air Force investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page discusses an interview with a Mrs. Fitzgerald, who reportedly saw a flying saucer. The text describes the questioning of Mrs. Fitzgerald and the investigators' conclusions about the encounter.

Text extracted from the document:

Include questions that allowed Mrs. Fitzgerald to express all her ideas of what she had seen. [Correct. The questions did not ask for the witness's interpretations.]

Charge 26: They did not take notes during the interview. [Correct. They obtained all the necessary information. They had been trained not to take additional notes because some witnesses become nervous when they see that their remarks are being written down.]

Basic charge "These civilians" in procedure proved that the suspicion was they were making an honest investigation. [Incorrect. They omitted no query that might have yielded useful evidence. They only was to report and try to account for what Mrs. Fitzgerald, not to record her belief in a hypothetical spaceship. The details of structure and motion that Mr. C. was eager to insert in the record were more impressive than the mere impression that the UFO was a solid object under intelligent control.]

The basic documents specifically charged that the investigators asked too few questions, and implied that they asked only five of Mrs. Fitzgerald. Yet she answered all the many questions asked, and had no way of knowing how many and what questions were asked, during all the latter part of the interview he was outside the house, trying to interrogate Sgt. C.

There is little more to say of the irresponsible attack based on the Fitzgerald case. The purpose was obvious. In a letter to one scientist who received a copy of the Fitzgerald Report, a member of the Akron Contents Bluntly stated that although the report had been prepared and distributed in order to prove that the Air Force investigation was not far-fetched, or scientific-T1C, this notorious affair and on the activities of civilian saucer-investigation groups in general is that of Dr. Thornton Page, the eminent astronomer who in 1952 served on the Robertson Panel.

After receiving a copy of the Fitzgerald Report, he wrote to a member of the Akron Contents Committee:

As a scientist I am interested in unexplained phenomena, but this one or two cases responsible for Mrs. Fitzgerald's sighting is or are not easy to explain by complex. It is just as possible to say simply that she saw a flying saucer 50 feet in diameter as it is to say that she saw nothing, or that she simply saw the train headlight on a pair of approaching headlights. It would be riduculous to be able to explain her sighting (and the others) satisfactorily from interviews two weeks after the event. It would be ridiculous.

to propose that a team of experts in the fields of physics, psychology, meteorology, engineering and railroading be sent to Sheffield Lake, Ohio, to study these sightings from all possible angles.
"I have already written to you and to others that your fundamental error is in oversimplifying your explanations of complex natural phenomena by assuming a common cause without justification. If you say that everything you cannot understand is caused by gremlins, then gremlins are everywhere! And the Air Force would need a much larger budget to investigate every sighting or hearing or feeling of a gremlin!
. . . The onus is not on the Air Force or me to prove that no flying saucer was present that night; the onus is on you and your UFO Research Committee to prove that there is no other explanation of what was seen and heard."

UFO at Sheffield Lake, Ohio

One of the most notorious accusations of the Air Force skulduggery made in connection with the saucer mystery, was that embodied in a saucer-ian study of the NICAP of Akron, Ohio, which maintained by the UFO Research Committee of Akron that the Air Force was covering up. Although the case is completely unexplained, we are told by the saucer lobbyists that the popular views and methods of the flying-saucer lobbyists have constantly been attacked. The incident, which has been the subject of thousands of words, deals with the strange light observed on a dark night for several hours by witnesses five miles from an Air Force or weapon base. The incident resulted in a lengthy document, used the public to spread enmity and distortion of other, more credible material. In one instance, the Air Technical Institute, in an equally barraged Air Force officials with requests but was never given a special report, apparently was a small and inexpensive monument has over been erected at the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Dayton, Ohio, reporting that on September 9, 1952, Mrs. William Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, received a letter from Mrs. Loretta Steigerwalt of Sheffield Lake, Ohio, reporting that on September 7, 1952, she had sighted a strange light which she would like to have investigated.

Text extracted from the document:

UFO Sighting
Mrs. ___ had gone to bed after watching the late movie on television. This was about 3:15 a.m. She was in bed with her eyes closed, when the room was illuminated by a very strong light, causing her to open her eyes. The witness was astonished, because the window curtains were drawn, and the room was "brighter than in the daytime." She then rose, and standing on the bed pulled back the curtains and looked out the window. (see fig. 1)

Looking through the window, the witness saw a round object (see fig. 2) about 20 feet in diameter and ten feet from the house. The object was traveling slowly in a northerly direction across the front yard, and losing altitude. At the time o f it was first sighted the object was about 5 feet off the ground. It proceeded until reaching a point about 50 feet from the witness, in the lot next door (see fig. 3) Here the object stopped for several seconds. It then moved south into the front yard to a point about 25 feet from the witness. The object made two tight clockwise turns, then shot straight up and out of sight.

Close questioning about the motion of the object brought out the following: During its move from a position in front of the window to the position in the lot 50 feet north of the window, the object was descending with a motion "like a feather dropping." The witness explained that this was a slight side to side oscillation. When it returned half way into the front yard, it made two tight turns. The witness thinks that the object was about 50 feet in diameter.

There is no visible photograph in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, containing text describing a UFO sighting.

As per your instructions, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

During the turning maneuver the object did not tip at all. It remained flat during the turns. Then the object flew out of sight, going straight up.

The witness was so frightened by this experience that she could not call out to her husband, who was sleeping in the bed. She did try to rouse him by kicking with her left foot, but was unable to do so. During this time she did not take her eyes off the object.

At this same time [REDACTED], 7 years old, got out of bed to go to the bathroom. He also was attracted by the bright light. Stepping on a back register to get the necessary height to see out of the window in his room, he watched the object perform the same motions described by his mother. However, neither party testified that the other had seen the object. Both went to sleep.

The next morning [REDACTED] told his father about the sighting, to which his father replied " It was just a bad dream." Several days later Mrs. [REDACTED] joined her husband and son for breakfast. It was then that she began telling her husband about the object she saw. Mr. [REDACTED] cautioned his son to keep quiet, and heard his wife repeat the story she had told. The reports coincided in every point, even though neither witness knew of the other when the sighting took place. Thus the object was seen simultaneously and independently by two persons.

Both witnesses reported a noise like an hum and a whirr combined. "Like a jet engine warming up," said Mrs. [REDACTED], who simulated the noise by whistling and humming.

The text output from the OCR system is as follows:

The object seemed to be "aluminum color." There were no lights on in nearby houses, and there are no street lights in this neighborhood. XXXXXKXXXKXXXKXXXKXXXKXXX the sky was cloudy. The source of the original bright light was not definitely established, but was assumed to be due to the object. During the entire period of observation the object was visible because of the light given off by two clouds of glowing gas which the object gave off. This gas emanated from two sets of tubes or "machine guns" in the rim. The gas did not seem to be propelling the object. The witness says that the light was sufficient to light up the surrounding ground, but threw no shadows on the project itself. She did not notice if other shadows ( from telephone poles, etc.) were present. The smoke was a gray-pink color.  

The object seemed to be solid, as nothing in the background could be seen through it. It was seen against a stationary and familiar background. The witness was looking down at it during the time it was stationary, so her estimates of size and location must be reasonably accurate.

The bright light which alarmed Mrs. XXXXX was seen by four other people in the neighborhood. One woman heard the whirring noise. No one else saw the object.

The same night, at 2:30 am, Mrs. XXXXX of XXXXX, Lorrain, was startled by a bright light which made the room she was sleeping in like "it was 6 am instead of 2 am." She thought that the sun had risen. The light mystified her, so she went to the window to try to discover the cause. Looking up in the sky, she saw a red object.
