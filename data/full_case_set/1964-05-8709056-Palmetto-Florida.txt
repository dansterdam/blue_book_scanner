The central portion appears to resemble a triangle or boomerang shape, with a dashed line at the top and bottom. The labels indicate "WIND 270°" and the cardinal directions North, East, South, and West.

LOCATION OF INCIDENT: Palmetto, Fla.
DATE OF INCIDENT: May 8, 1964
TIME OF INCIDENT: Unknown
METHOD OF OBSERVATION: Visual
DESCRIPTION: Calling my attention to a close flying object. Apparently a spacecraft or an unidentified flying object. There were no wings or other visible means of propulsion. The object, although moving, did not seem to be powered. It was elliptical in shape, white or silver in color, and about 75 to 100 feet in diameter. The observer was looking in a southwesterly direction. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes and then disappeared below the horizon.

INVESTIGATOR: USAF Project Blue Book
DISPOSITION: Insufficient information to determine origin. Project Blue Book lists this case as "Unidentified".

ATTN OF: DOI 12
SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO: AFSC (FTD), Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 

The following report is the analysis of an Unidentified Flying Object observed on 22 May 1964 and reported to this office during August 1964.

a. (1) The UFO was triangular shaped.
(2) The size of the UFO was approximately one fourth the size of a match head held at an arm's length.
(3) Color of the object was dark with five lighter colored spots.
(4) There was only one object.
(5) None.
(6) The craft was described as, "a distinct triangular silhouette with four lights in line along one edge and a single light at the apex of the triangle".
(7) None.
(8) None.
(9) None.

b. (1) N/A.
(2) The UFO appeared almost directly overhead coming from due West.
(3) The UFO disappeared when its position was approximately 85° above the horizon with a heading of one East.
(4) The UFO appeared in the West and traveled in a straight line to the East. The heading of the object was 090°.

There is no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. As an OCR system, I will output all the text found in the document:

"(5) "The object disappeared as a large dark bird would after dark."

c. (6) The UFO was in sight for 5 - 7 seconds.

d. (1) The sighting was a ground-visual.
(2) There were no optical aids other than the observer's eyeglasses.

e. (1) The sighting was on 29 May at 0104 hours Zulu time.
(2) The sighting was at night.

27230000N. The approximate position of the observer was 082350OW by

f. (1) Age 64

g. (1) The observer noted the weather as cloudy with no apparent moon and a few stars visible.
(2) thru (6) See attached weather report.
(7) N/Available.

h. None reported.

i. N/A. 

j. None reported.

The reliability of the subject is doubtful. Weather conditions were clear and the Highway Patrol reported no sighting. There is no apparent substantiating material. I doubt the veracity of the observer's statement.

FAA reports an aircraft in the vicinity at the time of the sighting. The aircraft was on a flight from Orlando to Sarasota, arriving at approximately 2009 local time (as shown on the attached map). The aircraft was a PA22 #50302. There are five lights visible from the ground on this aircraft. The port and starboard wing lights plus two landing lights which form four lights in line. A single tail light is visible.

As stated in the attached weather report, the wind direction was 270 degrees. Under these conditions an aircraft making a landing at the Sarasota Airport would land on the runway heading east and west with the aircraft heading approximately 90 degrees. Such a landing pattern might put the aircraft over the Palmetto area sometime between 2000 and 2009 hours local time.

During a phone conversation on 15 September 1964, he amended his estimate of the object's speed to "slightly more than the speed of a jet airliner". He also emphasized that "the outline of the object was very distinct".

It is the opinion that the sighting was the PA22 previously mentioned. The cloud movement may have given the aircraft the illusion of movement from west to east (see illustration). It is possible that the craft emitted no sound. However, it might submit that the craft emitted no sound. Nevertheless, it might submit that the object was too far away to be heard and/or there may have been a fault in the observer's hearing sense. In consideration of the observer's estimate of speed, it would suggest that his estimate is inaccurate due to the fact that his is an unqualified observer.

1. None.
