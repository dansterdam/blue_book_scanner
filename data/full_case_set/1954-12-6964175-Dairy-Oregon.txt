The image does not contain any photographs. It is a UFO index card, which appears to be a form used to document and categorize UFO sightings as part of Project Blue Book.

The text found in the document is as follows:

UFOB INDEX CARD

1. DATE: 22 DEC 1954
2. LOCATION: DAIRY, OREGON
3. PROJECT NO: 221725-62 (D)
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: 2 Yes
6. DURATION: 3 MIN - 13 SEC
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Ground - Silver colored, 40 ft. in diameter, tapered top and bottom, sound similar to generator. Hovered motionless. Observed with 10 power binoculars.
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Ground - Silver colored, 40 ft. in diameter, tapered top and bottom, sound similar to generator. Hovered motionless.
11. COMMENTS: IN THE LIGHT OF CONFLICTING TESTIMONY, OPINION OF FLIGHT SAID TO BE BASED ON SIGHTING AT ALTITUDE. THE SPEED OF THIS OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING SIMILAR TO THAT OF A NORMAL COMMERCIAL PLANE, HEADING APPROXIMATELY 120 THEN EXCEEDING A 60 FEET PER SECOND HEADING TOWARD THE EAST. SPEED STILL WITH THE SUN AND THEN SUDDENLY DESCENDING TO THE WEST AND PERFORMING THE CLIMBING TURN ON A 30 DEGREE ANGLE LEVELED OFF AT A 5000 (CONT)
