PATUXENT RIVER NAS, MD.
17 JULY 1959
ATTACK ON UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT 

The observation of the unidentified aerial object was made by radar operators at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Maryland, on 17 July 1959. The object was tracked on the radar screens at the station and was also observed visually.

The object was detected on the radar screens at approximately 0302 EST and was tracked for several minutes. The object was observed to be traveling at a high rate of speed and on an erratic course, making abrupt changes in direction. It was reported to have been at an altitude of approximately 19,000 feet. 

Several jet interceptors were scrambled to investigate the object but were unable to make visual contact. The object disappeared from the radar screens at approximately 0337 EST.

Base Officials Studying
Meteorite From Area

"Washington, June 10 (AP)- Air Force officials said today they are again studying a metallic object picked up on the earth in Hamilton Friday. 
He said "the object, apparently a meteorite, is being studied further."

THE OBJECT, pieced together from a sidewalk, was retrieved yesterday by Capt. D.H. Finnegan, public information officer of the Patuxent River Naval Air Station.

He indicated the object might be of some significance to the station's "air operations office," since it appeared to be associated with some "indications of flight operations."

Maj. Lawrence J. Tacker
Dir. Div. 7, OSI
Washington, D.C.

SIR:

This organization, has forwarded to me your letter of 6 October 1959 for reply. It is noted that your memorandum of 25 September 1959, and upon an evaluation of both pieces of correspondence, I am forced to comment as I see them, as follows:

1. The information most specifically information concerning "two local recent happenings," Your reply refers to the information as "incidents, or of course they were not."

2. You have sent to Miss several lengthy forms to complete; these forms deal ostensibly with information to be supplied by witnesses to some phenomenon. Since Miss did not herself witness the phenomenon referred to, she cannot, of course, complete the forms, and I am somewhat amazed that you inferred that she could.

3. If you are not in communication with the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base which all designated upon the phenomena, you suggest that we write to the base ourselves. I say this because you have written the reports (contained insufficient data for valid conclusions), and did not ask you will receive a reply, but rather requested that you would furnish any additional details you might have inquired.

Please do not feel that I an being critical simply because I enjoy the process; however, I cannot help but feel that large organizations with much to do such as your own, sometimes overlook important details of other people's time in this matter as much as I regret having to use my own. Thanks you for your continuing patience and consideration.

Sincerely,

Memo Routing Slip
ORGANIZATION AND LOCATION: Patuxent River NAS, Md.
DATE: 9 June 1959
SUBJECT: 

Larry Rafferty, this letter which we discussed on 14 June 1959 and which was treated as a CIRVIS report in Hamilton, Ohio 114, was from the Patuxent River, and called to our attention a TACAN as a CIRVIS. It was reported in the local newspaper, but our efforts to pin it down were not successful. The case was filed and no further action was taken. 
The sighting from the Patuxent River is similar but I do not believe we want to take any action on it at this time. A helicopter there is said to pick it up. We reported a TACAN-1 type earlier, but they could not duplicate it. 
This would be unidentifiable otherwise. It is possible this is the light 29 April 1959 concerning Patuxent River which was filed the same as the present one. In any event, it is being filed in accordance with routine procedure, and no action is contemplated.
INDICATED ACTION: FILED DED   TELEPHONE:

The text in the document is as follows:

10 December 1959

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 25 October 1959 concerning our report on the sighting of this object in the vicinity of Cincinnati.

I regret that we misunderstood this request as we did think they were sighting and had witnessed.

The 21 June 1959 incident at Hamilton, Ohio, was not a sighting. The Hamilton Laboratories had contacted the Air Force Base at Patterson Field when one of their employees reported hearing a sound which was thought to be a jet aircraft. Consequently, the Dayton-Patterson Air Force Base did not send a helicopter as requested, as there was no sighting.

All Air Force witnesses interviewed indicated no unusual objects were observed, and it appears that the sound was probably from some normal source and did not indicate the presence of a meteorite. The pieces of the object were definitely parts of a meteorite. The places where the object was found were examined with a magnetometer and no unusual magnetic readings were obtained. The letter outlining the Air Force conclusions followed.

We have no record of the 19 June 1959 sonic boom reports as carried in the Cincinnati Enquirer.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for May 23, 1959

FOUR PLANETS NOW VISIBLE

With four of the five planets that can be seen without a telescope visible during June, this month promises an unusual display of moved-up planets.

BY JAMES STOKLEY

THIS IS CERTAINLY a question each of us has asked more than once, "What planets can I see in the sky tonight?" Well, during June the answer will be: Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, and Venus, all of which are now visible in the evening sky.

While the Earth has nine planets in its family, only five of them-Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, and Mercury-can be seen with the naked eye. Of these, Jupiter and Saturn are the most prominent and Visible, being about as large as any of the stars. Mars is next in brightness, and Venus is also very brilliant. Mercury is the most elusive, never appearing far from the sun and sometimes being visible only around sunrise or sunset.

During June, four of these wanderers will be on display. This means that starting about sundown and continuing through the evening, you will be able to see as many as four planets at once, which is quite unusual. At least one, and sometimes two, of these planets will be visible for most of the evening, right up until the time you go to bed.

Regulus is the brightest star. Low in the west, the two bright stars that make up the "handle" of the Dipper are near Jupiter. Above and to the left of Jupiter is Saturn, very high in the southwest. Lower in the northwest, Pollux, in Gemini, is close by Mars, and Capitol, in Auriga, the charioteer, is just south and west of Venus, which should be very bright in the western evening sky. For the star-gazer, it should be an exciting month.

On Sunday, June 21, at 10:30 p.m. EST, the sun will reach its most northerly point, the summer solstice. After that date, the sun will appear to move southward again in the sky. One way to visualize this is that the sun's rays are striking more slantingly on the Northern Hemisphere, and less heat per square inch is being received. This means that after June 21, the days will gradually grow shorter as we move toward winter.

Close to Venus, when the sky gets darker, you will see Mars. At a distance of 202,000,000 miles on the 15th, it is only a tiny reddish speck, but Venus, at a mere 31,000,000 miles, shines brightly in the west. Stars which became visible earlier in the evening, such as Arcturus in the northwest and Spica lower in the southwest, will continue to be seen during the early evening hours.

Large-scale Carvery

Washington, D.C. specialists have designed a postal card that displays a large-scale three-dimensional carving representing the Statue of Liberty, with the word "LIBERTY" prominently shown stamped on the image. This card will be sold, and large-scale carvings of the Statue of Liberty, about four feet high, will be available for purchase by the public from the Department of Justice building at 9th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. They will cost about $5 each.

ENROLLMENT
ENGINEERING Enrollment Drops First Time in Years

THE INCREASE in students enrolling for engineeri courses in the past few years has not been con tinuing, according to a report from the United States Offi ces of Education. For the third straight year, enr ment in engineering schools of the United States has decreased, one in five engineering schools having a smaller enrollment next fall.

Furthermore, one in five engineering schools are expecting a further drop in enrollment next fall, this being the third year in succession that there has been a decline.

In the report it was explained that reasons for this decline were given as being: a lessening of interest in engineering as a profession by students and parents, based on reports of the general economic condition, fear of unemployment on graduation.

Increased concern about the rights of women en gineering graduates, especially during the job appl cation period, was also mentioned as one of the fa tors credited with the decline in engineering en rollment. The report states that "this recent decline may well be the start of a longer range trend" in this field.

NEW DEADLY DISEASES
Made From Tiny Molds

THE TINY mold that causes mushroom-like growth in old bread and jams has now been identified as the source of a new deadly disease, according to Dr. Schaefer.

He said that these tiny molds can produce a new disease called "lymphomatosis" which can be passed from animals to man. 

Three different types of these molds were placed in experiments with animals and found to cause ailments similar to the so-called "Hodgkin's disease" in humans. The ailments could not be cured by the usual treatments.

Dr. Schaefer warned that these tiny molds, though microscopic, can be deadly and that further research was needed to determine the exact conditions under which these diseases can be transmitted from animals to man.

Oppenheimer Urges End Of Arms as Weapons

THE ABILITY of modern science to produce instruments of warfare, weapons of mass destruction, and other new technology which threatens humanity should be a major concern, said Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, N.J. He urged that continued research and development in these fields be carefully restudied.

"Arms must not continue to be the last resort of the diplomacy of nations," he said. Too much of our scientific work and the efforts of our young scientists are being directed to the needs of war, he warned. There will be enormous problems ahead if the direction of much of our scientific work is not changed.

The past lesson of history has been that technological progress has too often outstripped man's social and political institutions and corrupted his power over nature. Science must be re-directed toward more constructive ends, Dr. Oppenheimer declared.

ASTRONOMY
Relenschwerdt Comet May Give Fall Meteor Display

ACCORDING to Richard G. Hodgson, the light of the comet Relenschwerdt which has now become visible in the western sky after sunset may stimulate an unusual fall meteor display.

"Although it is now much brighter than usual, the comet's nucleus has grown progressively dimmer since its closest approach to the sun on May 20," Hodgson said. "As the comet recedes from the sun, it appears to be throwing off more dust and debris which may produce a spectacular meteor display this coming fall."

The comet will be visible all during the summer and until about November, Hodgson predicted. He said the size and intensity of the comet's tail will determine how spectacular the meteor shower will be.
