Air Memorandum Number 6, dated 15 February 1949 

An object which appeared to resemble a row of three dots observed by four (4) F-80 pilots from the 339th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. The object located along the road at Kisawa Air Force 39-57, 17.57 following ROE. The object, all one color, resembled a tower-like, however, no tower has ever been sighted on 23 August 1947 at 1430 K.

There were three (3) F-80 flying 10-10 circuits at the time of sighting. Personnel flying these aircraft all said as a personal opinion that they saw no unusual objects.

Anti-aircraft units were contacted at intelligence that none were firing which left us more in the dark, actually.

Radar site in the area was inoperative due to routine shutdown.

Observers report that the object could only have been an airway kite due to the speed; it flies that it definitely was not an aircraft due to its shape.

There were no roads in the area which would allow the object to have been towed from the ground.

U.S. Navy reports that they had no activity in the area at time of sighting.

The document appears to be part of an investigation report from Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. The diagrams illustrate the sighting of an object and the flight path of an aircraft, possibly in relation to a UFO sighting observation.

on the ramp and was not observed again possibly due to
heat waves caused by the P-80 warming up on the ramp.

C E R T I F I C A T E

At approximatley 1530 hours on 23 August 1949, the undersigned 
observed a light or silver-colored rectangular object traveling at 
an estimated speed of 400 miles per hour.  This object did not re-
semble an aeroplane but appeared identical to a rectangular tow-
targer.

The object was traveling in a northerly direction at approximately
200 feet altitude or less and paralleling the coast line.  This
officer was about three miles from the object and observed it during
approximately five miles of travel.

This officer was in the company of Maj. _________and Capt.___________
the 49th Fighter Group Operations when this sighting was made.  Upon
my calling attention to this object, those three officers discerned 
the object immediately and all admitted a confused lack of recognition.

The object disappeared behind an R5D-1 parked on the ramp, shortly
thereafter, this officer noticed a local P-80 in the same vicinity at a
higher altitude and in the opinion of this officer there was no similarity
in appearance or lightness of color to the object in question.

                                                        /s/

the information correct and complete to the best of my knowledge.
