UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #147 -- Springfield, Ohio -- 27 July 1948

The description of this incident, although meager, is in agreement with the hypothesis that the object observed was a rare-type brill. Thus, "brill: red tail of 2 deg," "traversed in straight line," "great height," and the short time in sight all increase the probability that it was a brill. meteor. The fact that it was travelling north, at this time of night, implies that the meteor was crossing the orbit of the earth on its way toward the sun when the collision occurred.

The image contains a blurred and unclear object at the top, resembling a small, horizontal rectangle with irregularities on its surface. It is not possible to provide a detailed description of the photograph due to the low quality and lack of clear features.

Here is the text from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

INCIDENT #747 -- Springfield, Ohio -- 27 July 1948

The description of this incident, although rea...rs, is in
agreement with the hypothesis that the object observed was a fire-
ball. Thus, "bright red tail of fire," "traveling in straight line," 
"great height," and the short time in sight all increase the probab-
ility that it was a bright meteor. The fact that it was traveling 
north, at this time of night, implies that the meteor was crossing 
the orbit of the earth on its way toward the sun which the collision 
occurred.
