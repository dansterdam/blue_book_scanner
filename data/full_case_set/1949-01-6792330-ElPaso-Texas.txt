Acting on telephonic instructions received from DO #7, Kirkland AFB,
Kirkland Field, New Mexico, on 31 January, 1949, in which J. CHARLES
TALMADGE, JR., Administrative Supervisor advised that a peculiar
light or aerial phenomena had been observed at 1755 hours, 30 January
1949, in the vicinity of Walker AFB, Roswell, New Mexico, and that
30 was desired information, a tower operator of Walker AFB, a
contacted for information. The following action was taken: A check
with Police Department, Sheriff's Office, Municipal Airport, the Comme-
rcial Air Lines in Roswell, New Mexico, was made to determine if any of these agencies had received any
reports pertaining to this phenomena. Results negative. Eight persons
who had witnessed the aerial phenomena were interviewed and the
and find coordinates with an engineer's transit reading of azimuths and
observations was taken at points of observation on Walker AFB. An almost
house-to-house search was conducted East of Roswell by OSI and Dr.
kilometer markers guided throughout New Mexico for all possible witnesses.
was also conducted throughout the extended New Mexico and West Texas. The
search for additional information southeasted towards Clovis, New
Mexico, and South of Roswell to a point about fifteen miles South of
Artesia, New Mexico. In Artesia, this questioning elicited the informa-
tion that about the approximate date of the appearance of this meteor
(interviewees could not recall the exact date), a noise resembling some-
what the sound made by the robot bombs utilized by Germany against England.

UNCLASSIFIED

In 1949 was heard by two men. An aerial and ground search conducted in 
the vicinity of Lamesa, Texas, for physical evidence was negative. A 
report from a ten year old boy in Amherst, Texas, reporting a sound ac-
companiment with the aerial phenomena, was obtained.
   
DETAILS:

1. A telephone call from Mr. CHARLES NAVELJOER, Administrative 
Supervisor, 10 #117, Kirtland AFB, Kirtland Field, New Mexico, on the 
morning of 31 January 1949, instructed this office to ascertain the azi-
muth, elevation, and direction of a peculiar light observed near Walker 
AFB at 1755 hours, 30 January 1949, by Sgt EDWARD P. McCRARY. 

2. This is a joint report of Special Agents JACK B. WILLIAMS, 
LEWIS S. RICKERTT, and the writer. 

AT ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO

3. The Municipal Airport, Sheriff's Office, and Police Depart-
ment of Roswell, New Mexico, were contacted on 31 January 1949 and ad-
vised that no report had been received in their agencies of any aerial 
phenomena to the predicted day. The Continental Airline, and Civil Air 
Service Air Lines stated on this date that no flares had been utilized 
by any of their personnel in or near Roswell. 

AT WALKER AFB, ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO

H. Sgt RAYMOND D. PLATT, AF 122SL077 (MOS766); Sgt EDWARD P. 
McCRARY, AF 1916155 (MOS 552); Sgt DONALD M. McKENNA, AF 9V201050 
(MOS 561); Cpl WELLIAM L. BRYNE, AF 11Q62900 (MOS 552); and Pvt RUSSELL 
V. JOHNSON, AF 3727133 (MOS 552), A. Sq. 206 Sp. (Jackie) Jackson Heights 
AFB, Sgt DANIEL SULLIVAN, AF 11108687 (MOS 213); and JAN McDOWELL, Special 
Agent of Office of Special Investigations, Walker AFB, Roswell, New Mexi-
co, were interviewed on 31 January 1949 and the following facts obtained:
In 30 January 1949 at 1755 hours, a blue-green light resembling a flare 
was observed travelling on a horizontal line. This light came out of the 
North headed South at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet, moving slowly, 
and disappeared in the vicinity of SE Walker Air Force Base. To some 
observers, this phenomena disappeared in its entirety while other state-
ments mentioned a disappearance as a disintegration into a shower of
smaller lightened fragments such as a shower of sparks. The only sound 
accompanying this object was heard by Sgt McCRARY, who described it as 
a high pitched whining noise similar to that of a blowtorch. All of 
these observers sighted this light from a position West of it while 
facing East. 

5. Obtaining the services of an engineer's transit, the follow-
ing information was secured by making a reading from points of observa-
tion:

First observed at 52° magnetic. 
Last observed at 373° magnetic.
Elevation of 22°.

1900th AGS. Detachment, Walker AFB; Roswell, New Mexico, on 1 February
1949, elicited information identical with the other observers.

7. On 2 February 1949, an attempt was made to contact any per-
son who might have observed this phenomena from the East or facing West. 
This questioning continued for about forty (40) miles East of Roswell
with negative results.

8. Special Agent RICKETT continued this search throughout South-
east New Mexico and West Texas from 1000 hours, 2 February 1949, to 2100
hours, 5 February 1949, in the company of Dr. LINCOLM LA PAZ of the Uni-
versity of New Mexico. All information obtained during this part of the
investigation was retained by Dr. LA PAZ and will be incorporated into
his report to OSI.

AT CLOVIS, NEW MEXICO

9. Acting on information relayed to the OSI from a Major COMDOSE
of Sanding Base stating the Sheriff at Clovis, New Mexico, had information
pertaining to a meteor-landing near a farm in the vicinity of Clovis, an
attempt on 2 and 3 February 1949 to locate this farm in Clovis met with
negative results. Questioning of persons and law enforcement agencies
en route to and in Clovis did not produce any information of a pertinent
nature. The Sheriff at Clovis stated that he knew nothing of the meteor.

AT ROSWELL AND ARTESIA, NEW MEXICO

10. On 4 February 1949, a search was conducted South of Roswell
to a distance of approximately fifteen (15) miles South of Artesia, New
Mexico, to determine if possible the extent of observation of this aerial
phenomena. Mrs. NEIL ALBERTS, 506 West Main Street, Artesia, New Mexico,
was questioned as to a light observed by her, and it was ascertained that
she had witnessed this phenomena. A noise resembling a racing motorcycle
was heard in the vicinity or Artesia on or about 30 January 1949 about
0530 hours. The people hearing this noise stated its duration was about
three (3) minutes. Mr. WAYNE McFARlE and ROBERT D. PORTER, Hill On Com-
pany, East Main Street, Artesia, New Mexico, stated they had both heard
the noise. No directions, altitude, or speed was obtained because of
the difficulties of locating a sound in the air. Both observers stated

positively that the sound was not emanating from an aircraft. When ques-
tioned as to what sound, ***** revealed that as a soldier in the
European Theatre of Operations during the war, he had observed and heard
many robot bombs (buzz bombs). According to *****, the sound he heard
was somewhat like the noise produced by these bombs.

                             AT AMHERST, TEXAS

11. In accordance with instructions from Dr. La Paz on 5 Febru-
ary 1949, in Lemessa, Texas, a trip was made to Amherst, Texas, for the
purpose of interviewing Master *****, the ten (10) year old son of
Mr. W. DUFFY, President of the First National Bank, Amherst, Texas. At
interview with this family confirmed the fact that young DUFFY had wit-
nessed the aerial phenomena, with the added information that he had
heard a rumbling noise emanating from it. The best description expressed
by this ten year old boy was its similarity to a shot roll of thunder.
No other member of this family had seen or heard anything out of the or-
dinary prior to explosion and when the shot was heard by various citizens
within this locality. Information made that the boy was playing outdoors
on the day of this day during the observation, to assume position when he
observed this light was facing South. A highway running North and
South is located about a mile and a half to the West of his home. An
railroad was observed South of his home. Approximately thirty (30)
other persons questioned in this small town had not seen or heard any-
thing with the exception of MR. ***** Clark, First National
Bank, Amherst, Texas. MR. ***** stated that she was in a car heading
South about twenty (20) miles north of Amherst at this time when she
observed this light and judging its direction it was ENE to SSW South
of her. An interrogation of MR. ***** elicited information identical
to the description of the phenomenon. and ***** corroborated report-
er's of ***** who was in the car and also witnessed this light. No
sound was heard by these persons.

DETAILS

1. This investigation is predicated upon a telephonic request by Captain MELVIN E. NEWT, 17th District OSI (IC) USAF on 31 January 1949 to obtain all pertinent data in connection with an aerial phenomena seen in the vicinity of Alamogordo, New Mexico on 30 January 1949, at approximately 1300 hours.

2. On 1 February ██████████, Adjutant, Holloman AFB, Alamogordo, New Mexico advised that on 30 January 1949 at approximately 1300 hours, he sighted a single bright green object in an Easterly direction, ███████████ hesitated to estimate the altitude or distance of the object, ███████████ described the object as a bright green ball trailing green ink in a southerly direction, with a duration of six or seven minutes and did not make any noise to his knowledge. ███████████ advised that the object seemed "To fizzle out" in the air.

3. On 2 February 1949, this writer set up a transit at the approximate location where Major ███████████ sighted the object and obtained the following readings:

Location: 33° 55’ North and 106° 05’ West (Holloman AFB)
Object First Sighted: 55° Magnetic North and 30° Elevation.
Object Last Sighted: 63° Magnetic North and 32° Elevation.

4. On 3 February 1949, at the Office of Special Investigations, Holloman AFB, the writer interviewed ███████, ████████, who advises that on 30 January 1949 at approximately 1300 hours, while in the vicinity of Tularosa, New Mexico, and in the company of Sgt. ███████, who advised that on 30 January 1949 at approximately 1300 hours, while in the vicinity of Holloman AFB, he saw a single, bright green ball of fire to ███████████. The ball of fire seemed to be traveling in a southerly direction. ██████████ believed the object to be at an elevation of about 150° but declined to make an estimate of his distance from the object. ███████████ advised that the ball was visible for approximately 10 seconds. ███████████ stated that there was no apparent exhaust to the object, nor were there any clouds in the sky. ███████████ stated that the object seemed to die out of its own accord and did not explode.

5. On 6 February 1949, ███████ aerospace engineer █████████, Holloman AFB, Alamogordo, New Mexico advised that he had seen a similar ball of flame with a tail of same kind in ████ in San ██████, ███████. ███████████ described the object as traveling in a Southerly direction and added that the object was visible to him for approximately 6 seconds, ████████ described the object as being bright green and disappeared without an explosion and no apparently seeming to emit. ███████████ advised that there was no exhaust and no apparent wind, and that it was soundless.

UNCLASSIFIED

The writer set up a transit at the exact location from where
he sighted the object and obtained the following readings:

Location: 33° 56' North and 106° 05' West (Holloman AFB)

Object, First Sighted: 30° magnetic North and 10° elevation.

Object, Last Sighted: 75° magnetic North and 0° elevation.

6.    [REDACTED], Holloman AFB, Alamogordo, New Mexico
was interviewed on 8 February 1949. Mr [REDACTED] advised that his position at
the site of the sighting was approximately 3 miles south of Three Rivers,
New Mexico, that he was not positive inasmuch as to Mr. [REDACTED]
employment, Alamogordo, New Mexico, was in the car with him and
he, [REDACTED], thinks they are not at Three Rivers when the object was
sighted. The length of time the object, by estimate, was that it was a long
time, any where a portion of the object was included in the sky and the flash
of light from start until the time no further sight was made was approximately
10 seconds. Mr. [REDACTED] states, "It was just like someone turning a light
on very bright and off" An attempt was not made to take transit mead-
ings with Mr. [REDACTED] because of his unfamiliar position at the time of
the sighting, other than the difference of the shape of the object, the
description given him concurred with the other description noted
herein.

7.    Sgt. [REDACTED], MP Detachment, Holloman AFB, Alamogordo,
New Mexico was interviewed on 1 February 1949 and made the following state-

ments:

At about 1800 hours, while
in the company of [REDACTED] of Boeing Aircraft, I observed an
object that appeared to be traveling diagonally across in front of me, at
an angle of 30° left-to-right at a very slow rate of speed. It was black
against very close and appeared to be traveling very slowly. The object was
in my sight for approximately three or four seconds. The actions of said
object during this time were as follows:

Gentle downward glide; bright burning (Green and yellowish light),
a fizzling out and then a bright burning, and then appeared to
die out. (This could have been the effects of its passing
beyond my view.)

by direction of travel was nearly the same, thus the object's
direction was East-Southeast or Southeast, the weather at that time was
clear and cold, no ground wind and no indications of upper winds. My
location was west of Tularosa, New Mexico, beyond the railyards of the
Southern Pacific Railroad.

8. On 1 February 1949, the writer set up a transit at the approximate location where Sgt. ANTICN sighted the object and obtained the following readings:

   Location: 33° 04' North and 106° 02' West

   Object First Sighted: 47° Magnetic North and 25° elevation.

   Object Last Sighted: 65° Magnetic North and 26° elevation.

AT WHITE SANDS NATIONAL MONUMENT, NEW MEXICO

9. On 3 February 1949, the writer, accompanied by Mrs. _________ and Mrs. _________, Alamo[illegible], New Mexico and Mrs. _________ attempted to locate in the White Sands National Monument the spot from which the object had been sighted on 30 January 1949, at approximately 1755 hours, Because of the many devious turns of the road, only an approximate location could be established. Through the use of a transit the following readings were obtained: Location 33° 49' North and 106° 13' West.

   a.

   First sighted object: 55°Magnetic North and 12° elevation.

   Last sighted object: 60° Magnetic North and 10° elevation.

   b.

   First sighted object: 60° Magnetic North and 20° elevation.

   Last sighted object: 30° Magnetic North and 19° elevation.

   c. Mrs. _________

   First sighted object: 65° Magnetic North and 11° elevation

   Last sighted object: 72° Magnetic North and 8° elevation.

All of the above occurrences in the description of the object as being a single, bright burning green object, which ran in view approximately 3 seconds. Body had a gentle downward glide and seemed to fizzles out with the light becoming less intense and finally disappearing altogether. Angle of elevation was estimated above with transit and none would venture a guess as to the distance of the object. Optional statements were to the effect that object appeared to be between the Base and the White Sands, located to the West of the Base.

Doyle Rees, CO., White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico, advised by long distance telephone this date, that at approx 10.30 am, this date, a very bright flash occurred in the sky 45 degrees above the horizon, 30 miles NW of Alamogordo, N. Mex., and was followed by a descending green fireball which his wife, mother-in-law, and six enlisted men observed as it first apppeared slightly north of a point overhead and disappeared near the horizon to the South-southwest. It was a bluish green at first, its color becoming green as it lost its brilliance and altitude rapidly. The object appeared the size of a full moon and moved at a very high rate of speed at right angels to a normal pendelar course of similar objects observed falling in this same locality. Rees _ his opinion that the object was over 20 miles high when first seen {{BLACKED OUT PORTIONS}}... by them and that when it disappeared in the south-southwest, it was less than 5 miles high. Rees is an expert observer on matter of this nature having been connected with the German Rocket Programme/in Germany, during the war, and having conducted top secret experimentation in similar phenomena in the fall of 1948. There is no indication that the observed object was in any way harmful and there was no sound accompanying it.

and disappeared in the vicinity of SE Walker Air Force Base. To some 
observers, this phenomena disappeared in its entirety while other state-
ments mentioned a disappearance as a disintegration into a shower of
smaller lighted fragments such as a shower of sparks. The only sound
accompanying this object was heard by Sgt McCrary, who described it as
a high pitched whining noise similar to that of a blowtorch. All of
these observers sighted this light from a position West of the while
facing East.

8. The weather observer at the spot from which [REDACTED] observation
had been made and took observations with a pocket compass. These readings
showed that the round object due southwest, rather than south as [REDACTED]
enough, the true heading deduced from the observation given by the SITES was
273°, it is to be noted that this heading does not agree with the readings
reported by Dr [REDACTED].

9. The condition of the roads was such that it was impossible to
venture to reach [REDACTED] Arizona, by automobile on 17 February 1949. No per-
sonal interview with either [REDACTED] or the indians was possible therefore.

who telephoned at 1535 while the second (the time is exact since
the watch was checked with WWV shortly before this call) to re-
port that the [REDACTED] from the

DETAILS:

1. This is a joint investigation by this writer and Special Agent ______ Livingston.
AT GRANTS, NEW MEXICO

2. On 16 February 1949, this writer interviewed numerous persons in Grants, New Mexico, relative to the "fireball" observation of 16 February 1949. No results were obtained except a report that one C. L. "Cy" _____ had seen the object, ______ a real estate operator, could not be contacted.

ALONG U.S. HIGHWAY 66

3. Between Grants and Gallup, New Mexico, on 16 February 1949, the writer interviewed numerous persons at trading posts, but no one was contacted who had any knowledge of any anomalous celestial phenomena.

AT GALLUP, NEW MEXICO

4. Newspaper personnel, police, traders and other likely sources of information were contacted on 16 February 1949, with negative results. Several had knowledge of the "Four Corners" meteor fall of late 1947, but no more recent observations were obtained.

AT GANADO, ARIZONA

5. Enroute to Ganado, several members of the Franciscan Order were interviewed at St. Michael's Mission. No positive results were obtained, but it was suggested that the writer would be notified in the event that any of the brothers heard any reports from the Indians.

6. At Ganado Mission (Presbyterian), Dr. ______ reported that at about 2030 on 16 February 1949, his dog and his wife's dog were standing in the turnway on the hill looking east toward the stars, while the dogs raised howls, a brilliant white light was observed in the sky directly in front of the car, and somewhat above the horizon. The object appeared to hang stationary, then fell in a slight curve to the west. ______ said that the object had a slightly greenish color. Both agreed that the object had an orange tinge as it fell, and that sparks appeared to trail off the object, both while stationary and in its fall. _______ said that the dogs reaction was an indication that ______ and that his wife was surprised by the phenomenon ______.
 
7. In _______, a rancher said that while driving down from Vanderwagen at about _____ on 16 February 1949, which is about two and a half to three miles east of Gallup, ________ in a ball of fire that scared the dog in the back of his wagon. The object disappeared over a hill, and then there was a violent explosion. ______ said that the object had the force of an earthquake when the "crash" of the explosion was heard, _______ and a feeling similar to lightning _______ and the dogs reaction, _______ there was a _______.

sufficiently detailed to warrant additional investigation.

4. ... The third call received 30 January 1949, was from a Mrs...
who is employed at a casino at Lake Worth, Fort Worth, Texas. Mrs.
... reported that she had observed a blue streak through a West window
of the casino which started high in the sky and proceeded from North to
South ending approximately in the West. This blue streak was quite wide
appearing wider than a full moon. The streak came to a point both its

seconds. ...reported this at contact, F-3.

5. ... Mr. later came in at 205 Blanche Circle, Fort Worth, Texas, re-
ported at a later date, that he was driving with his brother in a car
on his highway to Dallas, Texas to eat dinner, when at approximately 1900
hours, 30 January 1949, and saw a somewhat similar ball of fire moving
from North to South in the West just West and its apparent direction of
motion occurred slightly South of due West about 15 degrees West of
the moon and 10 degrees lower than the moon. Similar to distinguish-
tion the color changed from Blue to an orange-yellow and then to a deep
red color. according to the observer the disintegration appeared similar
to a rocket burst.

6. ... Mr. ... was interviewed early in January by F.
of Headquarters Flight Section, 97 Bomb Group run duty in the CAA Control
Tower at Meacham Field, Fort Worth, Texas, in lieu of his observations re-
corded in this diary on 20th of December 1948. These observations were
rehearsed in the control tower and ... said it was observed that this
radar set had been run in a 360 degree circle. This radar disappear, then, 
at an altitude of about 15 degrees and that end on 39 degrees East, mis-
sately 180 West, not a UFO was circling due to storm areas locali-
in the vicinity of the air field. The color of the observation was
concurred to be white. ... suggests or ... himself until then
compared as similar to the green of the runway lights, but did not

7. ... Mr. ... On the night of 30 January 1949, ... placed a telephone
call to S... Municipal Airport, Big Springs, Texas, and spoke to
a ... who, together with two others, was in the control
tower at the air field and observed the phenomena. His observations
placed the beginning point at about 5 degrees North of North, and
points slightly North-East of Northwest. The exact duration was
between 5 and 7 seconds. The altitude was considered to be about 20
degrees above the horizon. The course was from North to South.

past occurrences which he may have in his files.

16. A report was received from the LaPaz containing his findings
relative to the object sight on 30 January 1949. In this report he describes
this ground track or "path" of the object. In previous sightings, except
sitions of the object. If the object is approached, the color shifts from green
to red or orange. The ground track extends from near Amarillo, Texas, to Loop,
Texas, a distance of some 513 miles. The course is slightly west of due South.
Well over a hundred interviews were considered in the development of data for
the LaPaz report, which is attached to and made a part of this report.

NOTE: The sub-final notes given by both  and Dr. LaPaz agree to about
ten miles. LaPaz evaluates his reports by azimuth on the basis of the person's
experience and probable ability to correctly calculate an azimuth
and elevation. The 15s possible that  data is not so related, inasmuch
as may of the readings were obtained from persons who place equal value
to all readings, and then take an average.

UNCLASSIFIED
On February 4th, the four persons just a few a low-level air
reconnaissance mission in a T-ll aircraft over the area surrounding
the  South-point of the fireball of January 30th. At the same time
a second ground survey party under Lt Paul Ryan made a careful field
search along a route extending from Lamesa through Amherst, Texas,
to Clovis, New Mexico.

3. As a result of the ground and air searches referred to above,
and of an analysis of the very large amount of information obtained
from eyewitnesses by personal interviews, by telephone conversation
and by letter, it has now (as of 1930. est.ex. - time of the fall) become clear
that several thousand persons in New Mexico and Texas saw this great
fireball January 30th. From the many available reports it now appears
that the last known visible location and heading of the
fireball immediately before the fall was visible at an altitude of-up-
wards of twelve miles in the sky. At latitude 31° 50', longitude
102° 50', and disappeared at an altitude of approximately eight miles 
over a point at latitude 33° 19', longitude 102° 22', after traversing 
a nearly horizontal path approximately 300 miles long at a velocity 
of from 30 to four minutes per second. Although the January 30th 
ire-ball must be ranked among the brightest observed in the last quarter
of a century, and in spite of this fact that its real path lay closer 
to the earth throughout its entire extent than any other meteorite 
path of which we now have knowledge. (excepting only two anomalous
green fireballs of December 12th and 20th, 1948), the meteoric 
destruction and long continued rumblings which without exception accompany large meteorite falls were not observed on January 30th during 
any time in the very large region covered by the various ground surveys.
However, what may have been hidden noises (anomalous whizzing and
missing sounds frequently reported by very distant observers as
having heard at the same time that a meteoritic fireball was
seen were heard as well), using radio near Plumhouse, Texas.

4. In addition to the absence of noise anomaly referred to in
the last paragraph, the fireball of January 30th, 1949, shows several 
other features (e.g., nearly horizontal path, absence of long enduring 
luminous train or dust clouds, inc. to the South direction, etc) character-
istic of the green fireballs earlier described in this series of
reports. However, the January 30th fireball was much brighter than
any of those earlier reported and differed from the other green fire-
balls in that many of the Texas observers who were situated nearest 
its path reported its color as blue, orange, red and even purple in-
stead of green.

5. Up to the present time (February 21st), no evidence whatever
appearing to be valid has thus far reached us as to exactly where the January 30th 
fireball has been circled area. However, as from the observa-
tions, no more thorough ground search should be made in this pos-
sible area of fall as outlined by the earlier survey; for, in my
opinion, any small meteorite which may have survived would now undoubtedly be a meteor large.

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

WHAT IS YOUR STORY?

"On the 30th of January 1949 at approximately 1500 hours, while in the company of Mr. [REDACTED] Boeing Aircraft, I observed an object that appeared to be traveling diagonally across in front of me, at an angle of 35° to 40° degrees above my line of sight. Its distance seemed very close and appeared to be traveling very slowly. The object was in my sight for approximately three or four seconds. The actions of said object during this time were as follows:

Gentle downward glide; bright burning (green and yellowish light) a fizzling, and then a bright burning, and then appeared to die out. This could have been the effects of its passing beyond my view).

My direction of travel was nearly due East, thus the object's direction was East-Southeast or Southeast. The weather at that time was clear and cold, no ground wind and no indications of upper winds. My location was west of Tularosa, New Mexico, beyond the railyards of the Southern Pacific Railroad."

            Office of Special Investigations

From:       Lincoln LaPaz, Director
            Institute of Meteoritics

Subject:    Anomalous luminous phenomena (4th report)

1. Several additional sightings of unexplained aerial lights phe-
   nomena have occurred since the third report in this series was pre-
   pared. Outstanding among the as yet undescribed incidents was the green fire-
   ball of Sunday evening, January 30, 1949, 5:51 p.m., MST. Within less
   than one minute after the appearance of the fireball, an eyewitness (a
   fisherman) called to report the major incision of a group of servicemen saw
   the fireball through an east window while seated about the dinner table
   in a brightly lighted room. Within three hours after the fireball ap-
   peared, more than 100 eyewitness accounts had been phoned or written
   in to the Institute of Meteoritics, or had been obtained by its director or
   one of his personal privations. An unusually high percentage of the reports
   came from military personnel (witnessing at various security or test reactors
   to projects, from guards and other small units in the field alerted to watch
   for anomalous luminous phenomena and from airplane pilots, control tower
   officials, and intelligence officers). On the first afternoon to midnight shift.

2. On February 1st, a staff car was placed at the writer's disposal
   by Major William Lodose of the Fourth Army and a field survey was begun
   of the region in New Mexico and Texas in which the majority of the ob-
   servers reporting the fall lived. This survey, carried out under unusually
   severe weather conditions, included visits to the following localities:
   towns in New Mexico, Vaughn, Ramon, Mesa, Tucumcari, Clovis, Roswell, and
   oriar towns, San Antonio, and Lamesa, Uvalde, Pecos, Pyote, Wink, Monahans and
   other towns in Texas. (Several of these towns were visited two or more
   times.) At Roswell, where very effective cooperation was provided by the
   OSI group at Walker Air Bace under Lt. Paul sobr and by the local CAF unit,
   under Lt. L. W. Coochan, Special Agent s___ at Lamesa, was added to the survey
   party and gave much aid in later work. At Lamesa, Texas, the ground sur-
   vey party was joined by an air search party consisting of Major Charles
   Phillips, USAF, Captain Alvin M. McNeal and Special Agent Jack L. Bowling,
   from the 17th District OSI Office at Mirtland Field, and Corporal Cochran.

DETAILS:                                     UNCLASSIFIED

   1. This investigation is predicated upon a telephonic request
by Captain MILTON N. MONT, 17th District OSI (IO) USAF on 31 January 1949
to obtain all pertinent data in connection with an aerial phenomenon
in the vicinity of Alamogordo, New Mexico on 30 January 1949, at approxi-
mately 1100 hours.

   2. On 1 February Major JAMES C. PETERSEN, AO-563633, Adjutant,
Holloman AFB, Alamogordo, New Mexico advised at 1130 hours, he sighted a single bright green object in an 
Easterly direction.                                          established to estimate its altitude or dis-
tance of the object,                 described the object as a bright green ball
of flame traveling in a Southerly direction, without evidence of smoke or
a trail of any kind,                advised this there were no clouds and that
the object did not make any noise to his knowledge.                  advised that
the object seemed to "fizzle out" in the air.

   3. On 2 February 1949, while set up a transit at the approxi-
mate location where                  sighted the object and obtained the
following readings:

Location: 33° 56' North and 106° 05'4 West (Holloman AFB)

Object First Sighted: 55° Magnetic North and 25° elevation.

Object Last Sighted: 63° Magnetic North and 32° elevation.
   
   4. On 3 February 1949, at the Offices of Special Investigations,
Holloman AFB, the writer interviewed Mr.                    , Flight Chiefs, 
Holloman AFB, Seeing Aircraft Company, Holloman AFB, who advised that on
30 January 1949 in the vicinity of 1600 hours, while in the vicinity of Tularosa,
New Mexico, and approximately 50 mi. Sounding Range - 2002932, Holloman
AFB, he saw a single, bright green ball of fire to the East.  The ball
of fire seemed to be traveling in a southerly direction.               believed
the object to be at an elevation of about 15° but declined to make an esti-
mate of his distance from the object.      advised that the ball was visi-
ble for approximately 10 seconds.          stated that there was no ap-
parent exhaust to the object, nor were there any clouds in the sky.  MARTIN
stated that the object seemed to rise out of its own accord and did not explode.

   5. On February 1949,                      , Weather De-
tachment, Holloman AFB, Alamogordo, New Mexico advised that he had seen a 
green ball of flame with a trail of smoke kind in an Easterly direction.
                  described the object as traveling in a Southerly direction and added 
that the object was visible to him for approximately 3 seconds. TAIL DE-
scribed the object as being bright green and disappeared without an explo-
sion but very nearly similar to sun spots on a... advised that there were no 
clouds and no apparent wind, and that the object was soundless.

The writer set up a transit at the exact location from where [redacted] sighted the object and obtained the following readings:

Location: 330 56' North and 106° 05' West (Holloman AFB)

Object First Sighted: 380 Magnetic North at 10° elevation.

Object Last Sighted: 75° Magnetic North and 3° elevation.

W.C. [redacted] was interviewed on 3 February 1949. [redacted] advised that his position at the time of the sighting was approximately 3 miles, South of White Sands, New Mexico, but, that he was not positive [redacted] was in the car with [redacted] [redacted] advised that they were not at Three Rivers when the object was sighted. The description of the object by [redacted] was that it was a longish object, greyish with a white flame in front, marina [sic] radials, length of object from 40 to 115 seconds. At his approximate position at the time reading with the transit [redacted] the presence of the shape of the object, the description given [redacted] concurred with the other description noted herein.

AT TULAROSA, NEW MEXICO

7. [redacted] of Holloman AFB, Alamogordo, New Mexico was interviewed on 1 February 1949 and made the following statement;

"On the 30th of January 1949 at approximately 1300 hours, while in the company of [redacted], of Boeing Aircraft, I observed an object that appeared to be travelling diagonally across in front of me, at an angle of 35° to 40° above my line of sight. Its distance seemed very close and appeared to be travelling very slowly. This object was in my sight for approximately three or four seconds. The actions of said objects during this time were as follows:

Gentle downward glide; bright burning (Green and yellowish lights) a dazzling cut and then a bright, spinning, and then appeared to die out. (This could have been the effects of its passing beyond my vision).

My direction of travel was nearly due East, thus the object’s direction was East-Southeast or Southeast. The weather at that time was clear and cold, no ground wind and no indications of upper winds. Location was West of Tularosa, New Mexico, beyond the railheads of the Southern Pacific Railroad.

Object First Sighted: 170° Magnetic North and 25° elevation.

Object Last Sighted: 650° Magnetic North and 26° elevation.

AT WHITE SANDS NATIONAL MONUMENT, NEW MEXICO

2. On 1 February 1949, the writer, accompanied by ----------
from ------ ---- base, Alamogordo, New Mexico and Pvts. ------
and ------ Armament, Alamogordo, North from a location in the
sands at White Sands National Monument. Sgt. ------, who had been 
sighted on 30 January 1949, at approximately 1755 hours. Because of the
many cautious turns of the road, only an approximate location could be
established. Through the use of a transit the following readings were
obtained: Location 33 14' North and 106 13' West.

a. Mr. ----

First sighted object: 55° Magnetic North and 12° elevation.

Last sighted of object: 60° Magnetic North and 10° elevation.

b. ------ ----

First sighted object: 68° Magnetic North and 20° elevation.

Last sighted of object: 70° Magnetic North and 19° elevation.

c. Pvt. ----

First sighted object: 65° Magnetic North and 11° elevation.

Last sighted object: 72° Magnetic North and 3° elevation.

All of the above concurred in the description of the object as
being a single, bright burning green object, which was in view approxi-
mately 3 seconds. Body had a gentle downward glide and seemed to fizzle out
with the light becoming less intense and finally disappearing altogether.
Angle of elevation was estimated above with transit above would venture 
a guess as to the distance of the object. Original statements were to the
effect that on object appeared to be between the range and the White Sands,
located to the West of the Range.

UNCLASSIFIED
CONFIDENTIAL

DETAILS:

1. This investigation predicated by a telephonic
request from the District Commander, 17th District OSI (CI),
Biggs Field, El Paso, Texas, was initiated on 31 January 1949.

AT BIGGS AFB, TEXAS

2. On 31 January 1949 (Cont'd) ***** and Pvt *****
were interviewed relative to the Green Fire Ball they had seen
on 30 January 1949 from the control tower, Biggs AFB, where
they were on duty as operators. They stated that between 1751
and 1753, on January 1949, they saw a green ball of fire cross
the horizon toward the east at approximately 30 degrees from
this tower (Coordinates: 31-50N 106-23W). This ball of fire
was approximately 3 to 5 degrees above the horizon travelling in
a north west to south-easterly direction. They stated that the ball
of fire lost no altitude during its travel and at the end of
traverse, enlarged slightly, then disappeared quickly.

3. The reporting agent accompanied by the above named
enlisted men took a transit to the control tower at Biggs AFB
and with the aid of the above named men determined that the
Green Fire Ball was first sighted at a true bearing of 55 degrees,
and continued travel to a true bearing of 70 degrees. The elevation
was determined to be 3 degrees above the horizon. When the fact
that the first of the incident was just prior to twilight the enlisted
men could not be definitely sure of the exact locations. When asked
if they knew of anyone else who had seen the Green Fireball, they
stated that a Lt Colonel ****, Technical Training Wing, Scotts Air Force Base, Scott Field, Illinois, and the
tower operators at the Paso International Airport, had also seen it.

4. In an attempt to locate Lt Col ***** it was learned that
he had returned to his home station.

5. On 31 January 1949, *****, 2310 Sanona

at about 1900 on 30 January 1949. It commenced on a true bearing
of approximately 45 degrees and ended on a bearing of approximately
50 degrees. It was above the horizon an approximately 6 degrees.
The coordinates of the tower at the Municipal Airport, El Paso,
Texas are 31-48'30" 106-22'40". It was stated that the "fireball" descended
on approximately a 15 degree incline, then leveled off, gained
momentum and broke into several pieces. As it broke up, it disappeared.

NOTE: In all cases during the interviews it was noted
by the reporting agent that the people interviewed could not be
specific as to their observations or descriptions either because
of the lack of interest or failure to observe the incident very
closely.

UNCLASSIFIED

DETAILS:

1. This is a joint investigation by the writer and Special Agent MELVIN 
E. NYE.

AT GRANTS, NEW MEXICO

2. On 16 February 1949 the writer interviewed numerous persons in Grants, 
New Mexico, relating to the "fireball" observation of 12 February 1949. No
results were obtained except a report that one ________ residence had seen the
object. The ________ real estate operator, could not be contacted.

ALONG U.S. HIGHWAY 66

3. Between Grants and Gallup, New Mexico, on 16 February, the writer
interviewed numerous persons at trading posts, but no one was contacted who
had knowledge of any anomalous celestial phenomena.

AT GALLUP, NEW MEXICO

4. Newspaper personnel, police, traders and other likely sources of
information were contacted on 16 February 1949 with negative results. Several
had considered the "Four Corners" meteor fall of late 1947, but no recent
observations were obtained.

AT GANADO, ARIZONA

5. En route to Ganado, several members of the Franciscan Order were 
interviewed at St. Michaels Mission. No positive results were obtained, but
it was arranged that the writer would be notified in the event that any of
the brothers heard any reports from the Indians.

AT GANADO MISSION (Presbyterian), I.M.

6. At Ganado Mission by the writer, stated that about 15:30 
on 15 February 1949, he and his wife, were returning from Gallup, 
they crossed the long ridge about two miles due east of Ganado, as they 
came up with hill west of the bridge, where the road heads south, a brilliant 
white light was observed in the sky directly in front of the car and some-
what above the horizon. The object appeared to hang stationary, then fall in 
a slight curve to the west. Mrs. _______ said that the object had a slightly
greenish color. Both agreed that the object had an orange tinge as it fell,
and that sparks appeared to trail off the object, both while stationary and
as it fell. Mr. _____ said that his first reaction was that it was an air
plane on fire, and that he had so reported to the Arizona State Police.

7. Mr. _____ informed the writer that one _______ Indian trader at 
Marateen, Arizona, had told him that two Indians said that they saw parts of
Sheep Springs when a ball of fire appeared "to have a hog" story them. The 
object disappeared over a hill, and then they heard a big explosion. These 
Indians are reported to have come in separately to Marateen, to have made 
separate observations, and to have told identical stories. This was ascer-
tained to be "born", 1330 on 12 February 1949.

9. The writer proceeded to the spot from which ***** observation
had been made and took observations with a pocket compass. ***** readings
showed that the road headed due east/west, rather than south as *****
thought. This was subsequently deduced from the observation given by *****
was 243°. It is to be noted that this heading does not agree with the readings
reported by Mr LA PAZ.

9. The condition of the roads was such that it was impossible for the
writer to reach Flagstaff, Arizona, by automobile on 17 February 1949. To par-
sonal interview with either ****** or **** the Indians was possible therefore.

**** Sheep Springs' is a very common place name in this area, so that
no accurate location is possible without additional information.

AT ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO

10. A memorandum report was received in response to a letter requesting
information of Mr ***** *******, a city optician, ***** naturalist.
Interview was conducted on 18 and 19 February 1949 by Special Agent *****
L. LATHAM, 2342 Piatt Ct., Al Albuquerque City.

11. ***** *******, was interviewed at his office at ****
*******, Fort Worth, Texas, on 18 and 19 February 1949. ****** at-
titude is prokaryotic however, he is highly emotionally about 1900
hours, 30 January 1949; on entering ***** city limits he noticed
collies and this avocation of his is well known, consequently investi-
gations did see this "fireball" contradict him and he had in his
possession a file concerning the observations of these persons. This
file was examined and the following salient information extracted:

The ***** duplicate call was received was film at ******* ******
was also telephoted at 1555 plus 20 seconds (time is exact since
was watch was stopped with TAI two shortly before this call)to ****-
fort that he had seen a green flare type sparks going from North

usually as her information given over this telephone was not considered
sufficiently detailed to warrant additional investigation.

8c. The third call received 30 January 1949, was from a Mrs. ---------
who is employed at a casino at Lake Worth, Fort Worth, Texas. She
reported that she had observed a blue streak through a west window
of the casino which started high in the sky and proceeded from North to
South ending approximately in the West. This blue streak was quite wide
narrowing wider than a full moon. The streak came to a point at its
rear end. The duration was approximated as being approximately 1 to 2
seconds. She claimed she did not observe any lighting.

9d. At a later date, she was driving with her husband in a car
on the highway from Hadley to Fort Worth, Texas, at approximately 1900
hours, 30 January 1949, and saw a similar green ball sized large going
from North to South in the West, just prior to its apparent disintegration
which occurred slightly north of a direct east and about 15 degrees off
the moon and 10 degrees lower than the moon. Just prior to disintegration  
a color changed from green to an orange-yellow and then to a deep
red color. According to the observers the disintegration appeared similar
to a comet burst.

10e. Mr. -------- was interviewed early in February by Lt. -------
since he had observed that phenomena was on duty in the CAA Control
tower at Meacham Field, Fort Worth, Texas, during the time of this occur-
rance of the phenomena and heard about it. His observations were
reported in the control tower of this was determined that the
indicated beginning point was approximately North 30 degrees West, true,
at an altitude of 15 13 degrees estimated by the end point was approxi-
mately due West by no altitude was determined due to extraneous lights
in the vicinity of the field. The duration of the observation was
considered to be about 2-1/2 seconds. The color of the "ball" was not
considered as similar to the green of the runway lights and did
see any terminal flare.

11f. On the night of 30 January 1949, --------- placed a telephone
call to Big Springs Municipal Airport, Big Springs, Texas, and spoke to
a Mr. ---------- who, together with two others, was in the control
tower at the air field and observed the phenomena. His observations
placed the beginning point at about 5 degrees West of North and the end
point slightly North of West of Northwest. The exact duration was
between 5 and 7 seconds. The altitude was considered to be about 20
degrees above the horizon. This also was from North to South.

12g. There is an alien among the determination the end point of the
"ball" in route to various individuals in the phenomenon of Paducah,

to his calculations the end point should have been observed from

that vicinity as being "in the moon". Reports received from that area 
from individuals who had observed the phenomenon gave this end point as 
a little to the right and below the moon.

13. From this information and from other information furnished by 
Mr. *******, announcer of Radio Station KFIM, Lamesa, Texas, it 
has plotted the ground track as being from approximately Tulia, Texas to 
Tokio, Texas.

14. From correspondence in the file, ****, it appears evident 
that Mr. ******* has been contacted by Army or Air Force Intelligence
Agents.

15. Mr. ******* has actively engaged in his avocation of the study 
of meteoritics for the past 15 years; consequently his conclusions and 
observations are considered to be highly reliable because in this 
area, Mr. ******* has individual wide capabilities with willingness to assist in
reporting on any unusual occurrences on his information on any 
past occurrences which he may have in his files.

The reporter was religated from the Lincoln LaPaz file containing his findings
relative to the observation of 3000 signals light. In this project this excerpt-
tions of the object are the; the observeris are advices reports, the this the

point over a hundred fifty miles were collected in file environmental of data for 
the LA PAZ report, which is attached to and made a part of this report.

NOTE: All the signal points given by both ******* and LaPaz agree to about 
ten miles. LaPaz evaluates the reports by laymen on the basis of the person's 
experience and probable ability to furnish accurate information as to azimuth 
and elevation. It is possible that ****** data is not so illimiteed, inasmuch 
as many of the readings were obtained from CONNUS, who gives equal value 
to all readings, and then takes an average.

To: Lt Colonel Loyie Ross, Commanding Officer
District No. 17
Office of Special Investigations

From: Lincoln LaPaz, Director
Institute of Meteoritics

Subject: Anomalous Luminous Phenomena (this report)

1. Several additional sightings of unexplained aerial light pheno-
mena have occurred since the writer's report in this series was prepared.
Outstanding among the as yet undescribed incidents was the reen fire-
ball of Sunday evening, January 30, 1949, 5:54 p.m., MST. Within less
than one minute after the appearance of the fireball, an eyewitness (RV-
was called to report the impression of a group of persons who saw
the fireball through a south window while seated about the dinner table
in a brightly lighted room. Within twelve hours after the fireball ap-
peared, more than 100 eyewitness accounts had been phoned or written
in to the Institute of Meteoritics, or had been obtained by its director
through personal interviews. Virtually 100 per cent of these reports
were from military personnel, as crews either preparing for Post Theaters
to open, from guards and other special agents already alerted to monitor
for anomalous luminous phenomena and from airplane pilots, control tower
men and civilian workers working on the late afternoon to midnight shift.

2. On February 1st, a staff car was placed at the writer's disposal
by command Major of the Fourth Army and a filed survey was begun
of the region in New Mexico and Texas in which the majority of the ob-
servations reporting the fell included. This survey, carried out whenever weather conditions permitted visits to the following localities
Moriarty, Estancia, Vaughn, Ramon, Mesa, Roswell, Caprock, Tatum and other
towns in New Mexico) and Lamesa, Seminold, Plains, Lubbock, Muleshoe and
other towns in Texas. (Several of these towns were visited two or more
times). At Roswell, where very effective cooperation was provided by the
Civil Air Patrol Mr. Kayser, Base Ingram at Fall flown, and the local C.A.P. unit
under Lt. V. T. Castner. Special agents All Tate; TS was added to the survey
party and was moved with it later north. At Lamesa, Texas, the ground sur-
vey party was joined by an observer, Petty Constantine V. Dicor Jr. On February
11, 1949, Captain Melvin. C. Neel and Special agent Jack L. Rolling,
from the 17th District OSI Office at Kirtland Field, and Corporal Cobarr.

On February 14th, the four persons just named flew a low-level air reconnaissance mission in a T-ll aircraft over the area surrounding the earth-point of the fireball of January 30th. At the same time a second ground survey party under Lt Paul Ryan made a careful field search along a route extending from Lamesa through Amherst, Texas, to Clovis, New Mexico.

3. As a result of the ground and air searches referred to above, and of an analysis of the very large amounts of information obtained from eyewitnesses by personal interviews, by telephone conversation and by letter, it has now (three weeks after the fall) become clear that several thousand persons in New Mexico and Texas saw this fireball. Particularly impressive the fact it has been possible to determine that the January 30th fireball became visible at an altitude of approximately two miles over a point at latitude 34° 50', longitude 102° 50', and disappeared at an altitude of approximately eight miles over a point at latitude 32° 10', longitude 102° 12', after travelling from the horizon behind approximately 131 miles total (for eyewitnesses at from seven to nineteen miles per second. Although the January 30th fireball might be ranked among the brightest ones ever used in the last quarter-century, and in spite of the fact that the real path lay closer to the Earth throughout its entire events than any other investigator. It also of which the writer has knowledge (excepting only the anomalous green fireballs of December 12th and 20th, 1948), the meteoritic company large meteoric falls were not observed on January 30th by anyone in the vast large magna covered by the various ground surveys. However, what may have been blown noises (anomalous whizzing and hissing sounds frequently reported by very distant observers as having been heard at the same time that a meteoritic fireball was seen) were heard as Blowing, New Mexico, and near White Shoals, Texas.

In addition to the absences of noisy anomalies referred to in this last paragraph, the fireball of January 30th, 1949, shows several other features (e.g., nearly horizontal path, absence of long enduring luminous train or dust clouds, light to South direction, etc.) characteristic of the green fireballs earlier described in this series of reports. However, the January 30th fireball was much brighter than any of those earlier reported and differed from other green fireballs in that many of the Texas observers who were situated nearest its path reported its color as blue, orange, red and even purple instead of green.

In the present case (January 31st), no evidence whatever supporting the belief that solid fragments fell to Earth from the January 30th fireball has been discovered. Moreover, in exactly as positive, a much more thorough ground search than had been made in the Santa Fe NA of an overturned by the earlier surveys, etc., the investigation no meteorite investigation which even any indication of a

observer(s):

In all cases it was noted that the people involved could not
be specific as to their observations or descriptions either because of the 
lack of interest or failures to observe the incident very closely.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:    On 30 Jan 1949 while on duty as Control Tower Operators,
Blggs AFB between 1751 and 1754, ------------------------- saw a green
ball of fire on the horizon on an estimated true bearing of approximately
335° from the Blggs Tower (coordinates: 31-50N 106-23W). This ball of fire
was approximately 3 to 5° above the horizon travelling in a northwest to
southeast direction. They stated that the ball of fire lost no altitude
during its travel (seemed reported, states that "There was a slight decline then
a change to a level course, after which it flared out and disappeared), and
that as the end it enlarged slightly then disappeared quickly. The reporting
agent took a transit to the Control Tower at Blggs and determined the actual
true bearing was 335° when first sighted and that the object actually travelled
on a true bearing of 50°. The elevation was determined to be 10° above the
horizon.

Due to the fact that the time of the incident was just prior to nightfall
the above-mentioned could not be sure of its exact locations. They stated
that a ----------------------- of the 3315th Technical Training Wing, Scott AFB Base,
had also seen the green fireball and that the tower operators at the El Paso
Municipal Airport had likewise seen it. (See 246A)

Source of Interview relative to intelligence and character of
observer(s):

STATEMENT OF FACTS:

While driving south on Highway 54 from Carrizozo, N. M., the above mentioned observers while looking east towards Sierra Blanca Peak slightly south of this peak and about 2 inches above the horizon sighted a flame. Time: approximately 1730 hours, 30 Jan 49. The flame was moving south slightly downward from Old Baldy (another name for Sierra Blanca Peak). The flame was oblong in shape, the front was a light blue, almost white, and the rear was a whitish blue. It was about 1-1/2 inches long. The flame was visible for an instant and after traveling 3 or 4 inches across the horizon it suddenly went out. It did not explode. There was no noise.

Second Report: Mr. was interviewed on 6th Feb. 49. He advised his position at the time of the sighting was approximately 3 miles south of Three Rivers, N. M., but that he was not positive that he was as far 
as Three Rivers at the time. Also was not as positive as with and 
that they were not as Three Rivers when the object
was sighted. The description of the object by was that it was a longish blobjet, seen with a whitish flame in front. added that he saw this object for about 15 seconds. An attempt was not made to take transit readings with Mr. because of his indeterminante pos-
ition at the time of his sightings. Other than difference of the shape 
of the object, the description given by concurred with the other
description noted herein.

observer(s):

NARRATIVE SUMMARY: Between the hours of 1740 to 1750, 30 Jan 1949, 
M/Sgt ROLLAND M. McDONALD, saw an object which looked like a solid fuel rocket
about 4 feet in length approximately over the Municipal Airport, El Paso, Texas
(could have been nearer or farther). It was about 3,000 feet high and was
traveling in a slight downward angle. A stream of fire about 15 or 20 feet
long was shooting out the back. (Fire died out when object appeared to be 
over the Administration Building of the Airport. -- seen in front of Post
Theatre, Ft Bliss) Flame appeared to be definitely that of a powder rocket
rather than a liquid fuel rocket. No sound was heard. Color of flame
was bluish white. Body of the object was cylindrical and gray-blue in color.
Flame was six to ten (6 to 10) times the length of the cylinder. The flame
appeared to change in intensity and length. It flared out in the manner of
a powder rocket. Direction of travel was north to south.

Sgt SITKO of the 9930 TSU, Security Detachment at Research and Development,
Ft Bliss, Texas, also saw this object.

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 30 Jan 1949 at 1755 hours, a blue-green light resembling a flare was observed travelling on a horizontal line. This light came out of the North headed South at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet, moving slowly, and disappeared in the vicinity of SW Walker Air Force Base. To some observers this phenomena disappeared in its entirety while other statements mentioned a disappearance as a disintegration into a shower of smaller lighted fragments such as a shower of sparks. The only sound accompanying this object was heard by Sgt McCrary, a tower control operator of Walker AFB, who described it as a high pitched whining noise similar to that of a blown torch. All of the observers sighted this light from a position West of it while facing east.

Obtaining the services of an engineer's transit, the following information was secured by making a reading from points of observation:

First observed at 52° magnetic
lasts observed at 57-1/2° magnetic
Elevation of 22°

The following grid coordinates were secured:

    a. Center of Walker AFB:     104° 31-1/2' W    33° 18' N

    b. Control Tower (reading from center of WAFB): 75' W  5470' W

    c. Tennis Courts: 1125' N  5650' W

    d. Base Theater:  1925' N  5600' W

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

WHAT IS ALL ABOVE?

On 1 Feb 49 a search was conducted south of Roswell to a distance of approximately 15 miles south of Artesia, N. M. to determine the extent of this aerial phenomena. Mrs ***************** was questioned as to a light observed by her and it was ascertained that she had witnessed this phenomena.

A noise resembling a racing motorcycle was heard in the vicinity of Artesia on or about 30 Jan 49 about 0530 hours. The people hearing this noise stated its duration was about 3 minutes. *** ******** and *** ********** Allen Oil Company, E. Main St., Artesia, N. M., stated they had been separated by a distance of about 3 miles at this time and both heard the noise. Both observers were positive that the sound was not emanating from an aircraft. When questioned as to the sound ********* *** ******** stated in his opinion that if one closes during the war he had observed and heard many 'robot bombs (buzz bombs). According to him the sound he heard was somewhat like the noise produced by these bombs.

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

_______________________: On 3 February 1949, the writer, accompanied by Mrs. _________________________ Street, Alamogordo, New Mexico and Mrs. _________________________ Michigan Avenue, Alamogordo, New Mexico, attempted to locate in the White Sands National Monument the spots from which the objects had been sighted on 30 January at approximately 1755 hours. Because of the many crisscrossing tire tracks, no normal an approximate location could be established. Through the use of a transit, the following readings were obtained: Location 53° 19' North and 106° 15' West.

    A. Mrs. _________________________:
       First sighted object: 55° Magnetic North and 12° elevation
       Last sighted object: 60° Magnetic North and 10° elevation

    B. Mrs. _________________________:
       First sighted object: 65° Magnetic North and 20° elevation
       Last sighted object: 60° Magnetic North and 19° elevation

    C. Mrs. _________________________:
       First sighted object: 55° Magnetic North and 11° elevation
       Last sighted object: 72° Magnetic North and 9° elevation

All of the above concurred in the description of the object as being single, bright burning object, which was in view approximately 3 seconds. Body had a gentle downward glide and seemed to fizzle out with the light becoming less intense and finally disappearing altogether. Angle of elevation was estimated above the transit and one would venture a guess as to the distance of the object. Original statements were to the effect that object appeared to be between the ______ and the White Sands, located to the West of the Base.

Occupation and hobbies: ________________ Control Tower Operator

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

______________________ WHAT IS HIS ABILITY?

Mr. ________________ was interviewed early in February by J ________________, since he discovered that Marshall was on duty in the CAA Control Tower at Meacham Field, Fort Worth, Texas, during the time of the occurrence of the phenomena and had observed it. His observations were rehearsed in the control tower and from it is was determined that the indicated beginning point was approximately North 6 degrees West, the at an altitude of about 13 degrees and that the end point was approxi­mately due West but no altitude was determined due to extraneous lights in the vicinity of the air field. The duration of the observation was considered to be about 24 seconds. The color of it "fireball" was compared as similar to the green of the runway lights. _________ did not see any terminal flares.
