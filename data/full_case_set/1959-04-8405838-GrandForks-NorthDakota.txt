I wish to report what I saw the other night at about 2:00 a.m. I will tell you the thing I saw.
A cigar-shaped helicopter powered by 3 small reactors sort of rested right over my place a few times. Each time it light [sic] up the whole area as bright as day. It got so I could see everything clear to. It seemed to fall up again clean. An the light of the air was brighter than the real right. It stayed there enough to more the same.

Dear ----

This is to acknowledge the receipt of your recent letters addressed to various governmental agencies concerning unidentified flying objects and/or aircraft accidents.

The letter dated 9 June 1960 addressed to Captain Wallace W. Milwood at Wright-Patterson AFB, you asked him to confirm a statement he made in a letter dated 10 July 1957 to Major Wayne Ann concerning Air Force pilots firing at UFOs. Captain Milwood's statement is as follows:

"This new gunnery mission of pilots firing at UFOs. The Air Force officially denies any intention to fire at or attack such objects. The directive was strictly a "conventional objects" firing". Since World War II and the Korean War, the normal Air Force missions have been restricted to conventional objects."

In letters dated 13 June 1960 addressed to Captain Joseph L. Williams at McChord AFB, and 6 August 1960 addressed to Lt. Colonel Cormier L. Martin at Moisant Air Force Base, you asked if any Air Force pilots had fired at UFOs. The Air Force findings in these cases indicate a confusion with the fact that the Air Force does conduct firing exercises at conventional aircraft as part of their training and proficiency programs, but there is no evidence of firings involving a C-47 type aircraft. The Air Force findings in these cases do not constitute accident reports nor the cause factors are classified. However, the overall contents of the reports are for internal Air Force use and may not be consistent with previous reports, rumors and speculation that the Air Force was involved in UFO incidents.

In a letter dated 10 August 1960 addressed to Mr. Allen Dulles of the Central Intelligence Agency, you requested information on unidentified flying objects. Mr. Dulles has referred your inquiry to the Department of the Air Force for reply, as this subject which plainly appears under the cognition of the Department of Defense and the Air Force.

Call From 3agt Levy ext 6521 or 6529, Grand Forks AFB, N Dakota
regarding observation or appearance of strange object several days ago by observers at Minot, North Dakota. Through exchange of telephone conversations following was obtained:
He is a farmer and saw this object near the Minot. man site I-37. Sighting 50 miles east of Grand Forks AFB. Looked like glass bulbs inside of a ring. The sound was like a tractor back firing. He has made sketches of it. It was as 6pm that he observed this object. This man had reported it to Grand Forks AFB and told them he had reported it to Minot and was worried cause the UFO was near the Minot site. He hadn't thought anything about it at first but then got to thinking it was near the Minot sighting. Sgt Levy said the man had wanted to fill out forms or something of the kind.
Informed Sgt Levy that we would send this man a form 12 to complete. Sgt Levy is going to send us a report of his conversation and how the case got into his hands. He would inform the man that he was going to be sent some forms to fill out and that he was sure this would please him.

Dear Colonel Terry

I refer to your communication dated 1 August 1960.

If possible, and they are not classified, I should like to reduce copies of the regulations which deny me access to the accident report and/or cause factors of the C-118 crash of 1 April 1959.

On 23 March 1960, Lt. Col. Lawrence J. Tucker, USAF, Public Information Division, Department of the Air Force, Office of the Secretary, Washington, told Mr. [REDACTED] 

"The Air Force findings on the C-118 Trans- port Crash 1 April 1959 were prior error and not the result of thorough and judicious inquiry."

Does the Flight and Missile Safety Research Directorate concur in this statement? If so, why was the data, and not I, given to the public through some other means.

I would also like to know if the accident report and/or cause factors of the aforementioned crash are officially classified as "Top Secret", "Secret", or "Confidential" or are withheld from the public through some other means.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. *****, 

This is to acknowledge your recent undated letter concerning unidentified flying objects.

Mrs. ***, Director of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, forwarded your letter to me for analysis and evaluation of physical evidence she claims to have from a space object.

The Air Force Accident Board findings on the C-119 Transport accident on 8 April 1952 near Paynesville, Minnesota indicate that the accident was due to bad judgment. In this particular accident, the pilot was diverted by the lower to break off his approach due to aircraft in the vicinity. He subsequently crashed into the hillside.

1. Following is a written account of a telephone call between this directorate and the UFO Center. This is the information offered to the Center.

A call was received at the Grand Forks Air Force Base Operations on Wednesday morning, April 13. It was from a farmer, N.D., telephone number ...his farm is located 7 1/2 miles north and 2 miles east of McHenry. The farm is approximately 1 1/2 miles away from a Minuteman II missile site, T-37, and this is the reason he made the report. Sometimes between 3-7 April 1955, he made a sighting at 8 p.m. in the evening. All he could tell was that the object resembled glass balls in a ring and made a sound like a farm tractor backfiring. He didn't make the report at first, but later changed his mind because of the Minuteman II site.

Akron Speaker Says So
Flying Saucer Rays Bringing Down Planes?
By DON KIRKMAN
Those flying saucers are picking on us. Not only that, they don't like us a bit and are using an Eastern seaboard as targets for their ultra-sonic heat waves.
That's the story 200 Akronites heard Thursday night at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. An Akron speaker said that the saucers are dishing it out, high and low, with plenty of cold, flying identifiable white objects that may have a three-four inch speech on libelous language.
According to the director of the Akron electrical phenomena research institute, these high-powered heat waves, emanating from the saucers, could have been the cause of a blast from a saucer's "anti-gravity" motor.
The saucers are hostile!

HE CLAIMS the saucers have directed these invisible rays in both countries. These "sonic heat waves" that is, are bringing down planes, it is charged, in both countries.

This deadly weapon, he claims, is some diabolical electrical system in any machine or structure under control of flying saucer occupants for the purpose of navigation, communication and cargo planes.

It was also inferred that the intense vibrations of these "sick call" jumbo jets was caused by these mysterious invisible forces that "New York City's Building has been picketing."

The Air Force has spent $30,000,000 investigating them, he said, "and they don't say they're hoaxes, mirages and hallucinations."

"Airlines tell their pilots to keep their mouths shut and don't print or broadcast our facts Congress is investigating everything," he said. This, "because the investigating teams can't find the saucers."

The sighting of this unusual object was witnessed by two unidentified individuals who were traveling north on Highway 1-29 approximately 10 miles south of Grand Forks, North Dakota. The object was first observed by the witnesses at approximately 8:15 p.m. moving in a southerly direction.

Transcribing the text from the document:

We wanted to see what was on this first place. We landed at this place, and walking about the top of this place we noticed something coming in for a landing. It was about 3 feet across and was round and flat like a saucer. The undersides were a reddish color. It skidded to a stop about 50 feet away. This didn't you don't believe, and it doesn't care but it's the truth. We walked up to the thing and it was some animal like we'd never seen before. It was hurt and as it breathed it's body would rise and fall making a half foot hole all around it like a clam opening and closing. Quite a stink had been created out of one side and there was a sort of metal looking from aside. When it saw us, it breathed out only a few inches, only to pull back to earth as gain. It was noise and glanced on the top side. We could see no eyes or legs. After a 20 minute stay, if started pulsating once more, slowly rose to a height of 10 feet away. And so help me, that thing grew as bright as all get out.

April 29th, 1959, I was out in the back yard working on an old television chassis. The time was approximately 8:15 p.m. The sky was clear. The sun was setting in the west and a number of jet planes were passing by, leaving contrails. Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a metallic object hovering in the sky. It showed dramatically against the blue sky. It seemed to have a slight wobbling motion as it hovered there. For a time, I could not believe my eyes, and I stopped what I was doing to take a look at the pretty display which was so striking against the cloudless sky. Immediately, I ran into the house to call my wife, but by the time I had done this and returned, the object was gone. It was motionless in the sky to the north. We are only about a mile away from the Grand Forks Air Force Base, and I thought at first it might have been some new type of jet or experimental craft of some kind. But it had a little larger diameter. I estimated it to be about 1 mile away and about 800 feet in the air. It would seem to have been larger than one of our television broadcasting towers, which average a height of around 600 feet. On the great contrast against the sky, it appeared to give off a soft glow, not as brilliant as a spotlight, but rather a gentle hue to it. After hovering for about fifteen minutes, it suddenly disappeared from sight. My wife, who had also see it, said she could not account for the disappearance. As soon as she exclaimed "Look, there it is again," over there to the left," it too low and disappeared behind the trees and rolling hills in the distance. It seems to have been heading in the direction of the east. The trail to the bright object hovering did not seem to indicate any distortion of the mountains, so I am inclined to think it was hovering rather than anything else. It was too early for it to be any kind of astronomical body, and the day light was too strong. The sky was perfectly clear. It was not as brilliant as a star or planet in a cloudless sky.

SUMMARY

On April 8, 1959 at 11:30 PM CST, an object was sighted by Mr. Joseph Frank Egan, a reporter for the National Guardian newspaper in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Mr. Egan was on routine patrol with the Grand Forks police department when the object was sighted.

The object was described as a bright light, oval in shape, and about the size of a car. It maneuvered in the sky at a high rate of speed, making several rapid changes in direction. The object was estimated to be about 2,000 feet in altitude.

The object was observed for approximately 3-4 minutes before it accelerated and disappeared from sight. Mr. Egan reported the sighting to the Grand Forks Air Force Base.

No further details or information were provided in the document.
