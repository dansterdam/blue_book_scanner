27. In the following sketch, indicate the direction that the object was observed (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show the compass direction when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

Here is the text contained in the document, transcribed using OCR:

Dear ... Garden L... 

I have a a rereport of a strange object observed by his children in the town. They were outside the house and looking up saw what they described as a very bright and fast moving object which was unlike any plane or satellite they had seen before. It appeared to be about the size of a quarter held at arm's length and was very bright and moving at a tremendous rate of speed across the sky. The object was seen for only a few seconds and then disappeared. The children were very excited and frightened by what they had seen. 

What I would like to know is whether there were any UFO reports from this area on this date, and whether any other people saw the object. If so, I would appreciate any information you can give me about the sighting. Thanking you in advance,

Yours truly,
J.A. ...

Text output from the document:

TDPT (UFO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/mh/9 May 69
UFO Observation, June 18, 1967

Elmhurst, Illinois 60126

1. Reference your unidentified observation and subsequent photographs of June 15, 1967. The results of photo analysis of your negative are as follows:

a. Examination of the photography reveals that the three images in question are apparently photographic phenomena. Noting that the nature of the phenomena is such that it is decreasing in size, distance and reflection, the images appear to the rear of the photographer, being reflected on the window. Since the photographic phenomena produces no discernible detail, objects from outside may be the actual targets rather than the unidentified flying objects moved slowly, as it is not reasonable to assume that the character of the image were due to the actual objects. The photographic image seems rather to be merely reflections or distortions of objects off-axis to the camera range. The image forming light is then equated to an object distance of less than 6 inches' camera focal length. This then equates to an object distance of approximately 6 feet from the camera (when photographing through a window). This indicates the real objects (or reflections) are off-axis to the camera, and the near theory which locates the actual objects outside the train, appears to be confirmed.

The image contains a photograph of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The document is titled "PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT" and the subject is an "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT" located in Colorado (California, Nevada?). The date of the report is 19 June 1967. The photography section states that there are "Two original negatives and corresponding prints" and that the quality is a "Pair".

The text of the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 67-83
DATE OF REPORT 30 November 1967
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 
LOCATION Colorado (California Nevada?)
DATE 19 June 1967
PHOTOGRAPHY
FTMS Two original negatives and corresponding prints QUALITY Pair
PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order Number 67-107 submitted by Major Quintanilla, requesting photo analysis of purported unidentified flying objects photographed from the California desert on 19 June 1967. The photography reveals three images.
ANALYSIS: Examination of the photography reveals that the three images in question are apparently photographic phenomena. Noting that the curvature of the observation window is consistent with the images, these objects were photographed through the windows of an aircraft in flight. The images are inside the windows and nearly stationary - i.e. a fixed focus camera. Objects from about 6 feet to infinity will be sharply in focus. The images appear to be dark silhouettes and it is reasonable to assume that they are slightly out of focus which places them nearer to the windows than the usual sharp focus areas outside the aircraft. This then equates to an object distance of less than 6 feet. Assuming that the objects were not in contact with the aircraft windows, they must have been at a distance of several inches. This distance from the observation window precludes the objects being at a great distance from the camera. In addition, the apparent lack of motion and relatively stationary positions, with almost no change in angular position relative to the cameras position and the window, but do not appear to be related to anything outside the observation car.

The image does not contain any photographs, only text. The text appears to be a "Photographic Data" section, listing information about the type and make of camera, focal length and make of lens, brand and type of film, shutter speed used, lens opening used, filters used, whether a tripod or solid stand was used, and whether "panning" was used. It also mentions the exact direction of the camera with respect to true North and the ground, and notes that supplemental information is unavailable.

PHOTOGRAPHIC DATA
1. Type and make of camera Rolleiflex automatic 100
2. Type, focal length, and make of lens Standard
3. Brand and type of film Kodachrome 
4. Shutter speed used Standard
5. Lens opening used: that is, "f" stop ?
6. Filters used None
7. Was tripod or solid stand used No
8. Was "panning" used ?
9. Exact direction camera was pointed, with relation to true North, and its angle with respect to the ground. 
10. If supplemental information is unobtainable, the minimum camera data given above and the angle of the camera and shutter speed readings of the camera.
