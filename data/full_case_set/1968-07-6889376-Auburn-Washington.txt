The text in the document reads:

Proposed Statement for Release at McChorci AFB, Washington

The following UFO sightings were submitted to the Air Force for evaluation from Auburn, Washington:

28 June - 0030 hours, local
1 July - 0050 hours, local
29 June - 0220 hours, local
2 July - 0110 hours, local
30 June - 0440 hours, local
2340 " " "

Because the sightings were of a moving star-like object, the Project Blue Book will attempt to determine if a satellite could be the stimulus.

SDC engineers are studying the above times and determined that COSMOS 103 rocket body would be visible from Auburn at the above specified times.

Project Blue Book will classify these sightings in the satellite category.

** If queried about the nature of COSMOS 103, the following statement is authorized:

COSMOS refers to a series of Soviet space research satellite launches. COSMOS 103 was launched on Dec 20, 1965, with an announced payload.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Sub j : UTO Rpt, Auburn, Washington

29 July 1968

Captain Shea, SAFGIP, called Lt Marano at approximately 0830 hours, 29 Jul 68 regarding the news release given to the local base. Capt Shea said he had coordinated with the press desk there and they coordinated with NASA. The only thing that had been changed in the proposed release was the following sentence: "Therefore, it seems probable that this rocket body is the stimulus for the sightings."

Lt Marano was informed that the release had been given to McCord AFB on Friday afternoon, 26 July 1968 for release.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON UFO SIGHTINGS FROM AUBURN, WASHINGTON

The following UFO sightings were submitted to the Air Force by an observer in Auburn, Washington:

28 June 1963 - 0000 hrs local, 0110 hrs "
29 June 1963 - 0020 hrs local, 0200 hrs "
30 June 1963 - 0040 hrs local, 0220 hrs, 2315 hrs "
1 July 1963 - 0050 hrs local, 0240 hrs, 2330 hrs "
2 July 1963 - 0110 hrs, 2340 hrs "

Because the sightings were of a moving star-like point-source of light, the information was given to the Space Defense Center (SDC) to determine if a satellite could be the stimulus. SDC ran a computer program using the above dates and times and determined that Cosmos 103 Rocket Body would have been visible from Auburn at the above specified times. Therefore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that this rocket body is the stimulus for the sightings.
