AF FORM 112 - PART II
UNCL ASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PART 1 OF 2 PAGES 

On the night of 21 June 1952, 2300 PDT, I was on duty as Senior Controller in the 814th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron. While busy directing traffic in the Sacramento air space, I noticed a strange object in the sky to the west of Sacramento. It appeared to be an aircraft at first, but suddenly made a drastic change in speed and direction. The object appeared to be circular in shape and gave off a very bright light which illuminated the surrounding sky. The object climbed rapidly and disappeared from sight. I immediately alerted the other controllers and we observed the object on our scopes for several minutes. The object showed up on our radar screens and was tracked for a considerable distance. I hesitate to estimate the velocity of this object, as it was beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. The visibility at the time was excellent and there were no clouds in the sky. The object was in sight for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing. I am convinced that I observed something out of the ordinary and which defies explanation.
