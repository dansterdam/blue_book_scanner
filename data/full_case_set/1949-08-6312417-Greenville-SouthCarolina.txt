1. An unidentified flying object was sighted over Greenville, S. C.,
at 1930E, 15 August 1949.

2. The 1930E weather for Greenville AF Base was 4000 scattered, 15
miles visibility. Greenville, S. C. Municipal Airport weather at 1930E
was 25000 broken, 9000 scattered, 30 miles visibility, with distant thun-
derstorms in all quadrants.

3. Two witnesses reported the unidentified flying objects. One of
the witnesses was not identified and the other was Mr. [redacted]
Avenue, Greenville, S. C., who is employed at the [redacted] Municipal
Airport.

4. No photographs or sketches are available.

5. The unidentified object was described by the witnesses as round,
fairly large, grey, moving in a northeasterly direction at an undetermined
speed. No sound was heard nor was any exhaust trail visible, its altitude
was estimated to be 5000 feet or less. The maneuverability is not known,
but it appeared to be moving at a constant speed and altitude.

6. All reports were received via Plan 62 Interphone by Maxwell Flight
Service Center from Atlanta Air Route Traffic Control Center. The Atlanta
ARTC received them from the Greenville Municipal Airport Control Tower.

7. The operations section of the 316th Troop Carrier Wing investigated
this incident further and determined that the unidentified object was a
Geological Weather Service balloon believed to have been released in Tennessee.
