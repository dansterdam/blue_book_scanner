Text transcription:

DEAR SIR,
ON THE MORNING OF MARCH 12, 1965 AT 4 A.M. NEW YORK TIME, A MOST REMARKABLE OCCURRENCE TOOK PLACE. 
IT HAPPENED TO HAVE BEEN UP RATHER LATE THE NIGHT OF THE 11TH (MARCH) AND WAS ABOUT TO GO TO BED AND WAS GAZED BRIEFLY UP AT THE STARS. IT WAS A VERY CLEAR NIGHT (MORNING). I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE, A FAIRLY BRIGHT STAR, EITHER STARTED FROM STANDING POSITION, OR SLOWLY HAD BEEN MOVING VERY SLOWLY DUE SOUTH I BELIEVE, OUR PERHAPS SOUTHEAST, IN ONE GENERAL DIRECTION. I CALLED TO MY WIFE TO VERIFY WHAT I THOUGHT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN "ILLUSION". SHE TOO SAW THE OBJECT MOVING. IT WAS EXACTLY AS THOUGH A STAR WERE DRIFTING IN SPACE, NO SMALLER, NO LARGER, JUST A WHITE SPARKLE, AND ABOUT AS BRIGHT AS BRIGTEST VENUS WHEN IN POSITION.

Faintly, it oissappeared out of view from my kitchen window, less than a half hour later. Surprisingly so, I spotted another (star?) moving just as slowly, only from another direction this time. 

This time I was perceptive enough to run and get my telescope and tried to focus it before it disappeared. Unfortunately, if it is not a very powerful scope, I was unable to see what looked like a flat-side object, either like a half-moon or a letter 'C'. It was only able to see this for another of seconds at most.

On the very next night(or soon after), approx. March 13, 1965, at 5:49, after waiting patiently for nearly one hour, to perhaps see another such event take place, it was suddenly, if at all.

READER : FOR THERE IS THE SKY, COMING
FRUH THE STAR DIRECTION AS THE SECOND 

TIME - THE SKY DEEPENED AGAIN, WHAT -
WHAT CAME AS CEDENTS ? 

WELL, WHAT HAS STUNNED ME MOST, FROM
THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE, IS THAT, THIS 
TIME, THE STAR STOPPED SOMEWHERE
WAY OFF TO MY LEFT, BEING, I BELIEVE,
ABOUT NORTH EAST, IT WAS ONLY FOR
A COUPLE OF SECONDS, - BUT I DON'T
BELIEVE MY EYES DECEIVED ME, AS I HAVE
VERY GOOD VISION - 20/20. IT THEN
PROCEEDED TO MOVE AGAIN AND BEGAN LONG,
IT ALSO VANISHED OVER THE HORIZON. 

NOW I AM NOT A TRUE-BLUE ASTRO-GHOST,
BUT A STAR'S HAVE HAD A DEEP INTEREST
IN THE UNIVERSE AND IT'S MYSTERIES. IT
SEEMS THAT I MUST KNOW OR AT LEAST
HAVE AN IDEA WHAT IT WAS. I COULD HAVE
SEEN ON THESE TWO OCCASIONS.

IT WOULD PLEASE ME IMMENSELY IF YOU COULD GIVE ME SOME SORT OF AN EXPLANATION IN THIS MATTER. IN ADDITION, IF THERE IS EVER ANY POSSIBILITY FOR ANY POSITION IN EITHER YOUR OR GOVERNMENT,  OR ANOTHER SUCH OUTPUT, WILL YOU KINDLY CONSIDER ME AS A POTENTIAL? I THINK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE DO NOT CONSIDER THIS LAST REMARK THE WORKS OF A CRANK.

P.S. I COMPLETELY FORGOT TO MENTION THAT I READ THE ARTICLE WRITTEN BY RICHARD LEWIS - SPECIAL TO THE LONG ISLAND PRESS FROM THE CHICAGO SUN-TIMES, ON MARCH 17, 1965. A LITTLE TOO EXCITED I GUESS.
