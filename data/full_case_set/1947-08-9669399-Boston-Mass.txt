The image does not contain a photograph but appears to show two hand-drawn sketches or symbols, which are quite unclear and abstract. 

Below is the text found in the document:

---
Incident #73 -- Boston, Massachusetts -- 4 August 1947

There is nothing in the evidence given here to suggest that the object sighted was astronomical.

The description suggests further that the object may have been a highly distorted reflection image of the sun on a balloon or aircraft. The "deep gold" color ascribed to the object tends to indicate this interpretation.
---

The handwritten annotation at the bottom right of the document appears to be "Initials", but it is not entirely clear.

The image appears to be a faded and partially obscured document page. There are no photographs on the visible part of this page. Here is the text that can be discerned from the document:

Many parts of the document are not legible due to redaction, fading, or poor image quality.

- page 3 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It is a picture of a page from a document that appears heavily redacted with several lines and sections blacked out, making it unreadable in large portions.

Unfortunately, due to the redactions and poor image quality, the text cannot be accurately transcribed. The top of the document has a header which reads "UNCLASSIFIED," but the rest is too obscured to furnish a reliable transcription.

This image does not contain any photographs; it is a typed page from a report. Below is the text transcribed from the document:
