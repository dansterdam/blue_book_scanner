The image contains a photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The document appears to be a report from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's UFO investigation program. The report describes several UFO sightings in Hawaii from August 2 to August 5, 1965. The report includes details of the sightings, including the color changes observed and the direction and speed of the objects. However, there is no photograph of the UFOs themselves included in this particular document page.

1. Following is a summary of UFO activity in the Hawaiian area from 2 August to 5 August 1965. Five UFO's were reported and information regarding them is as follows:

a. On 2 August 0600Z (3/2000 local) a family living in Waikiki beach reported bright lights moving across the sky at high altitudes. The lights appeared to change colors from red to blue. During the observation the telephone conversation with the family indicated the lights to be very bright and maneuverable.

b. On 4 August, 0644Z (3/2044 local) numerous sightings were made of an object which fell from the sky southwest of Oahu. The reports differed on the colors but all agreed it was a bright object which left a brilliant trail behind it. The Honolulu VORTAC said it was bright enough to illuminate the whole sky as it fell. Both pilots believed that it burned out before hitting the water. Observers from scientific areas had reported it had occurred.

2. Investigations revealed that the object finally broke into three pieces before it burned out. The first investigation revealed that it could not have been from U.S. space operations and it is unlikely that it was reentry of any artificial satellite. Tentatively investigators estimate the object was approximately 100 to 150 NM southwest of Oahu at position 19361/159-35F.

TAC C-130 crew observed a high altitude, high speed UFO pass directly overhead on 4 August at 12302 (approximately). At ocean station on November, the same object was sighted and reported to lit up the whole sky as it passed overhead. Investigation revealed it was probably an Atlas satellite drifting from launching. The bright light sighted on 5 August at 0500Z was reported, but ruled non-significant and no investigation was made. This information is forwarded as background information for the Commander.
