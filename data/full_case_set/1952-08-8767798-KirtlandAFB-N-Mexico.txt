There is no photograph or image present in this document. This appears to be a Project 16073 weather data sheet with various data fields filled out, such as date of observation, time of observation, station observing, wind speed, direction, altitude, velocity, and direction. The document also includes questions about inversion layers, thunderstorms, cloud cover, and visibility.

THE PILOT OF THIS AIRCRAFT STATED THAT HE OBSERVED A STRANGE LIGHT WHICH HE THOUGHT TO BE A METEOR. HE STATED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE LARGER THAN NORJALL STARS AND BRIGHTER TNAH TNS PLANET VENUS AND HIS ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO IT BY ITS UNUSUAL BRIGHTNESS.

HE STATED THAT THIS LIGHT APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING TO THE NORTHEAST AT HIGH SPEED AND THAT IT SWERVED OR CHANGED DIRECTION TO THE LEFT AT ABOUT 30,000 FEET. HE STATED THAT AFTER SWERVING IT APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING IN THE SAME GENERAL DIRECTION AS BEFORE BUT AT WHAT SEEMED TO BE A MUCH SLOWER SPEED.

HE STATED THAT HIS FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THE LIGHT WAS A METEOR UNTIL HE NOTICED IT CHANGING DIRECTION AND SPEED. HE STATED THAT HE DID NOT REPORT THE INCIDENT TO GROUND STATIONS WHEN HE LANDED SINCE HE CONSIDERED IT TO BE ONLY A METEOR AND NOT TO BE OF ANY IMPORTANCE FROM AN OPERATIONAL STANDPOINT.
