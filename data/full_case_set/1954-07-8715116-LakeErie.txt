INVESTIGATION OF THE SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT OVER LAKE ERIE ON JULY 29, 1954

Narrative: 
The object was first sighted at approximately 9:10 P.M. EDT on July 29, 1954 about 10 miles southwest of Cleveland, Ohio, over Lake Erie, by witnesses from the East Cleveland Police Department and the Cleveland Airport Traffic Control Tower. It was described as being in the shape of an inverted bowl, silvery in color, and estimated to be about 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed to hover, or remain stationary, for a period of about 10-15 minutes, then accelerate at a high rate of speed, climbing out of sight in a northeasterly direction. No sound was reported.

The object was tracked on radar at the Cleveland Airport Tower, and the ARTC Radar at Chautauqua, New York. The radar target indicated an estimated speed of 500-700 mph. The object disappeared from radar at a range of about 65 miles.

The weather conditions were clear, with visibility of 10-15 miles. There was an inversion layer at about 1500 feet, which may have contributed to the sighting. 

The object was observed by at least 12 credible witnesses, including police officers and air traffic controllers. Their descriptions of the object were consistent, and they were apparently unable to explain what they had observed.

The investigation is continuing, and the Air Force is attempting to determine if any identifiable aircraft was in the area at the time. Any further information that may shed light on this incident will be promptly reported.

Here is the text transcribed from the image:

"HERE WAS A SAUCER-SHAPED OBJECT THAT HAD BEEN SEEN AND THAT HAD LANDED.
HOWEVER, THE WITNESSES DID NOT FEEL THAT THIS WAS SUFFICIENT CAUSE FOR ME TO MAKE A TRIP THERE. THEY ASKED ME TO COME ONLY IF FURTHER SIGHTINGS WERE MADE.

ON OCTOBER 3, 1954 A COLONEL R. J. O'BRIEN, WHO STATED HE WAS CHIEF OF OPERATIONS FOR THE EASTERN AIR DEFENSE FORCE, CONTACTED THIS OFFICE AND STATED THAT A LANDING OF A DISK-SHAPED OBJECT HAD BEEN REPORTED ON THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER 1, 1954 ON A FARM NEAR BUFFALO, NEW YORK. THAT OBJECT, ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, HAD LANDED IN A FIELD AND LEFT IMPRESSIONS IN THE GROUND THAT WERE SUBSEQUENTLY MEASURED AND PHOTOGRAPHED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AIR FORCE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE COLONEL STATED THAT A COPY OF THE REPORT AND PHOTOS HAD BEEN FORWARDED TO THE DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE, WASHINGTON, D.C. IT WAS REQUESTED THAT I CONTACT THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED AND OBTAIN ALL POSSIBLE DETAILS.

I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE BUFFALO OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND WAS ADVISED THAT THEY HAD BEEN AWARE OF THE INCIDENT AND HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH OFFICERS OF THE EASTERN AIR DEFENSE FORCE. THEY STATED, HOWEVER, THAT THEY FELT THE MATTER WAS OF SUCH A NATURE THAT THEY PREFERRED NOT TO BECOME DIRECTLY INVOLVED, AND THAT I SHOULD CONTACT THE MILITARY REPRESENTATIVES CONCERNED.

AAA PERSONNEL WERE CONTACTED BUT THEY REFUSED TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH ME OR CONFIRM ANY OF THE DETAILS. THE FARM OWNERS WERE ALSO CONTACTED BUT THEY STATED THAT THEY PREFERRED NOT TO DISCUSS THE INCIDENT AND FELT IT BEST TO REMAIN SILENT ABOUT IT.

SINCE IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FURTHER DETAILS FROM THESE SOURCES, AND WITHOUT THE COOPERATION OF THE MILITARY OR THE FARM OWNERS, I DID NOT FEEL THAT A TRIP TO THE SITE WOULD BE PRODUCTIVE AT THAT TIME. HOWEVER, I HAVE REQUESTED THAT IF FURTHER INFORMATION IS DEVELOPED ON THIS INCIDENT, THAT I BE NOTIFIED."
