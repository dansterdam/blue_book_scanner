1. Your attention is invited to the attached correspondence from Hq USAF relative to the above subject.

2. As indicated in the attached letter (Para 1) no definite conclusions can be reached on the information presented. However, it has been the experience of this office that observations in the air especially at night are often very deceiving even to the most experienced observers.

3. A check of the files in this office reveals no other reports which add anything to the report in question with regard to both the time and location involved. Request the matter be investigated by your office to determine whether any other persons reported similar observations with would coincide with the standpoint of time and general location.

1. The enclosed report is forwarded to your department for analysis and comment. It is probable that a definite conclusion cannot be reached from the facts presented in the report.

2. The nature of the observation suggests a possibility of the object being an intelligent balloon. However, this explanation was explored when Lt/JG Haven was interviewed by Lt CO's jet fighters had much that the light had a speed range much greater than a jet fighter. It appeared to climb at a terrific rate of speed, even when climbing. The rate of climb was estimated to be over 2000 feet per minute. Therefore, it would not be possible to chase this incident as a lighted weather balloon, if the description is considered accurate.

3. It is requested that this report be reviewed and evaluation forwarded to this Headquarters.

Subj: Encounter with strange phenomena while night flying

1. While on a routine night flight from NAS Atlantic City on the night of 17 November 1950, the following incident took place: I was flying on a standard IFR (instrument flight rules) instrument approach we approached Lakehurst at approximately 5,500 feet.  As I leveled off at 5,000 feet, my co-pilot sighted a single bright white light, which I judged to be another aircraft's fuselage light.  This light was slightly above me, and about 1,000 feet distant, moving in a southeasterly direction.  I immediately took evasive action by diving in order to avoid a collision with the other aircraft.  As I leveled off at approximately 3,000 feet, the light had disappeared.  I made a thorough search of the area but could not detect this light again.  The time was about 1951Z, as we were due to a fuel stop landing at Lakehurst.  When I pulled up the aircraft, I made a slight turn in order to get on this specific tail.  The visibility was extremely excellent with no overcast, and with all lights and the runway and field in sight.  There was no effort at that time to distinguish me or follow me out on this specific course, it turned a little more southerly as appeared I was instructed.  In less time that it takes to tell, this light, without making any kind of reversal, just turned nose down on me at an incredible speed, about 100 to 700 feet above.  Puzzled at this, my first reaction was to immediately open my throttles to gain some altitude, turning in order to keep this light in sight.  As before, it was still slightly higher in altitude than my craft.  The light appeared to be a single white light, close to 10 to 15 inches in diameter, and moved in a Slightly jerking manner, which I judged as a form of stabilization being done by the craft.  This light and maneuvering lasted for some two to three minutes, then the light turned in order to see this again.  As before, it was still slightly higher and appeared to be motionless over my aircraft as I maintained a constant speed and altitude.  I attempted to hold the light in front of me, but this object still appeared and disappeared again in a northwesterly direction.

Transcription of the text in the document:

UNCLASSIFIED.

Airborne, I switched to our squadron common frequency, and requested assistance from any "confine" aircraft in the vicinity. The Commanding Officer and his wingman, who were carrying out a low pass operation in the vicinity, answered my call for assistance. They checked my instruments for altitude and engine limitations, and flew in a 500 climb, maintaining their prescribed 150-155 knots. Holding in tight climbing turns, making about two orbits to my one. At 11,500 feet I ranned down the object stationary over a point a little west of our airstrip. The Commanding Officer reported over increase A/S 11,000 feet as turned by lights from a severe thunderstorm they had encountered in their approach. They were still in the area, but I did not see them. The object, as reported, continued in my sight. All this took place in about 55 to 70 minutes, and at the Commanding Officer's suggestion we returned to base. The Commanding Officer allowed us the light, but the object did not.

Having had experience with jets against conventional-1 in "Dog Fights", I have a good idea of their speed, but this object in the encounter described previously was nothing like jets. It was smooth in motion, and slowed or approached or receded at varying velocities, nothing but this white light. Pulling up even more after it passed, I tried to see if I could hit its wash or slipstream, but there was none. Only this single steady white light that could move with phenomenal speed and maneuverability.
