Mr. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ is quite well informed USAF. He has several books on the subject and knows a good deal more about them that our Government will not tell us. He has ably expressed his views about them that our Government will not sell as" highly classified" experiences which he could relate if he was not afraid of referring to his books and showing what he was trying to say.
