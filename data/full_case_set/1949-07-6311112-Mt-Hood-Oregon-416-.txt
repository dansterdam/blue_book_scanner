"At 2100 hours on 30 July 1949, between Stevenson, Washington, and Troutdale, Oregon, a group of unidentified lights were sighted by Northwest Airlines pilot********** near Portland, Oregon, while on a routine flight from Yakima to Portland. Thrush stated the object could have been two or three planes flying in very close formation, however, the red lights were on the wrong side for airborne aircraft. When Thrush circled the field to await instructions for landing, the object changed course about 50° and left the vicinity.

The co-pilot of the plane,********** also of Portland, sighted the lights but was not available for interview. **********, CAA traffic controller on duty in the control tower of the airport also observed the object. Basford reportedly observed the incident."

hovered in this area approximately thirty (30) minutes and then disappeared to the east.

incoming airliners over the airport. The pilots of those four airliners saw the
object and their names and addresses are available from ir.

two red lights and one white light that had been following
him. He reported that this object then turned to the south-
east and appeared to pull away from him quite easily. Captain
████████ reported that his indicated airspeed was two hundred
and ten (210) miles per hour while he was trying to intercept
the object.

      (a) COM Confr Ltr CP322ATC 7-3-2/1, Ser 01.22P32 dated 3 May 1949
1. In accordance with reference (a), following information is submitted:

At 2100 hours on 30 July 1949, between ________ and Troutsdale, Oregon, a group of unidentiﬁed lights were sighted by Northwest Airlines pilot __________ while on a routine flight from Yakima to Portland, Oregon. While the objects could have been two or three planes ﬂying in very close formation, however, the red li_hts were on the wrong side for air force aircraft. When contacted circled the field to await instructions for landing, the object changed course about 90° and left the vicinity.

The co-pilot of the plane, also also of Portland, sighted the lights but was not available for interview. CAA traffic controller on duty in the control tower of the airport also observed the object. ____________ closely observed from the ground tower. According to ___________ at the time airport spotlight on the object, which he thought at the time was a helicopter, to help guide it to a landing. However, the object disappeared at a high rate of speed and headed in a southeasterly direction when the light was focussed upon it. A description of conditions are as follows:

Weather: Clear, however object was sighted after sundown.

Sketches: None, since darkness prevented adequate observation.

Shape and Size: Not determined because of darkness.

Color: Red lights steady, white light on occasion.

Speed: Two hundred miles per hour.

Heading: When first seen approximately 210°, when last seen over Troutsdale, 500°. There was no change in the lighting with the change of heading.

Maneuverability: Course and elevation did not change rapidly.

Altitude: 6000 - 8000 feet.

Sound: None observed - other sounds in own plane would have obscured sounds.

Exhaust: None observed.
