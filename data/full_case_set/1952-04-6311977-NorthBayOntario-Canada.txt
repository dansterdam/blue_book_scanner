Ambassador * * * visits Ontario cities
Ambassador * * * has recently visited on a tour of Southern Ontario cities and met with officials of the Department of Commerce on April 17 and is scheduled to speak at a dinner meeting of the Toronto Board of Trade Club on April 21.

Comments: In his large official speech in Windsor the Ambassador said that peace with the Soviet Union is still the aim of U.S. foreign policy and he emphasized that this policy is the natural result of our national interest and that the policy of the U.S. Government really represents the desire of the American people. He noted that she high standard of living enjoyed by Americans is endangered by excessive armament and because the people of the U.S. are so far removed from the direct effects of war, made by the progress of science to develop weapons of vast destruction.

In interview on April 22, the Ambassador will speak on the pattern of foreign policy emphasizing that U.S. policies and actions are all parts of a program designed all aimed at preserving world security.

Flying Saucers Exhibit Increase
A report of the sighting of another flying saucer was stirred up considerable interest in the press during the past week. USAF stations at North Bay, Ontario, received two hundred and fifty reports of flying saucers within a 24-hour period, which followed the usual pattern of changes in direction and disappearance.

Comments: About 30 reports of sightings of mysterious objects have been reported during the past few years. In one instance in 1950 the objects were reported to have made a sudden shift in direction and to have moved at a tremendous speed. The Air Force has a routine procedure for the investigation of these incidents. The present flurry of reports is in that category.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a document or newspaper titled "WA JOURNAL Flying Discs No Joke Now In Air Force" which describes reports of flying saucer or disc sightings by air force personnel stationed at a base in North Bay, Canada.

WA JOURNAL
Flying Discs 
No Joke Now
In Air Force
The Air Force, which once laughed off flying saucer reports as products of over-ripe imaginations, today ordered its intelligence experts to study the causes of several discs tricking through the air over the North Bay, Ont., base.
Four airmen stationed at the North Bay base told their superiors they saw flying discs flash silently over the local air station and an RCAF statement said there was no reason to doubt the statements.
The men, described as veterans with several years' experience identifying conventional aircraft, said they spotted a "bright amber disc" in the sky over the airfield around 5:30 p.m. Saturday.
The object, they said, slowed down, paused momentarily, and then shot across the air field, stopped and then took off in the reverse direction. It climbed at tremendous speed and disappeared.
U.S. and R.C.M.P. telecommunications superintendents and G.C.C., an instrument technician, reported seeing a flying saucer the night of January 1. They said it appeared to be moving at supersonic speed.
One airman said Canandell said they turned the object for eight minutes and concluded it moved "exactly parallel to the earth". They said it changed direction slightly at times, sub-zooming and climbing and diving without a sound.
The Air Force quickly declined official comment about the latest saucers, whose sightings at one time were investigated thoroughly by the United States Air Force and declared questionable.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report discussing sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), also known as "flying saucers", as reported by Dr. Mackenzie.

The text in the document is as follows:

Can't Ignore Reports
Of Saucers: Mackenzie

Continued from Page One... Dr. Mackenzie said that at Chalk River that would cause any explosion or anything like that. He said, "At the moment we are mystified." Dr. Soltand said "At the moment we are mystified as much as anyone else."

In the sky were passed on to the board from the observers, and when they appeared reasonably scientific, they were looked into carefully.

There has been nothing yet to convince us that the reports we have are not possible and of real validity, Dr. Mackenzie said. At times we have had the subjects so close that we should have been able to see them and draw a conclusion. But we have not been able to do so. The new reports from the United States or elsewhere have not given us any more confidence. 

We are keeping our minds open and studying the situation as it develops, Dr. Mackenzie said. There are many things that become available that give us cause for concern.

Others here noted that the Canadian scientists have avoided the sensational or the controversial. They have not made any commitment to the theories advanced by some scientists in the United States.

The theory has been advanced already that saucers could come from outside the earth. Others say it is just a psychological trick of the mind. We have to check on nuclear fission developments. The physicists infer the space men may be anxious over the possibilities of disturbing the cosmic balance. A German scientist now in the United States who was chief scientist at a wartime atomic energy plant in Germany has kept records of persons from all over the world who have claimed to have seen such things.

Saladar, Antitman, No Longer Skeptics
Montreal, April 29 (CP) - Dr. P. D. Saladar and Dr. A. M. Antitman, two scientists who were formerly skeptics regarding unidentified flying objects, are no longer skeptical and declare that "scientific research should be carried out in a serious manner to investigate these phenomena, the case of the Dominion Scientists."
Dr. P. D. Saladar, chairman of the National Research Council's associate committee on geophysics, and Dr. A. M. Antitman, chairman of the associate committee on scientific information, made this declaration in an interview here tonight.
"We can no longer ignore the reports," said Dr. Saladar. "The Air Intelligence Claim that such reports can be simply explained away is simply nonsense."
Dr. C. J. Mackenzie, chairman of the Defence Research Board, who has been investigating the flying saucer mystery, declared in an interview that "scientific research should be carried out in a serious manner to investigate these phenomena."

The image contains a photograph of a newspaper article with the headline "RCAF Personnel See Flying Discs Near North Bay". The article describes how RCAF personnel observed unidentified flying objects near North Bay, Ontario, Canada on April 16, 1952.

Text from the document:

RCAF Personnel
See Flying Discs
Near North Bay
North Bay, April 16. — In the wake of persistent reports in the Nipissing area during the past few days that unidentified objects were to be seen in the sky here today cleared two RCAF officers who had observed the phenomena. 
The air force said that although there was no official RCAF view, there was no reason to doubt their activities.
Fit. Sgt. R.C.C. McRae, said that last Saturday he and Cpl. D.F.H. Lilly, members of the No. 6 Repair Depot, RCAF, North Bay Air Station, to the west observed the objects. They had reported 15 of the disk-shaped objects hovering for some time and then suddenly shoot straight up at a terrific speed.
"They seemed to be aluminum in color, but because of their speed, and the distance at which it had come, and at which we were observing them, we could not determine their exact size,' said McRae.
"They appeared at first as small spots high in the sky and then increased in size as they approached us at a fairly high rate of speed. For a few minutes they hovered and then suddenly shot straight up at a speed I would estimate to be about 1,000 miles per hour. There was no sound.
"We watched the objects with keen interest for several minutes and they were easily visible to the naked eye." 
McRae said that the objects traveled at a high rate of speed and displayed no outward sign of propulsion. "There was no sound," he said.
Expansion, I don't know what it is"
McRae said reports have been sent to the proper RCAF authorities.
