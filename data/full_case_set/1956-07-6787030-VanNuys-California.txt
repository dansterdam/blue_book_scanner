SUBJECT'S STATEMENT

Monday 16 Jul 56:
I was awakened at 1:45 a.m. by the barking of my dogs. Looking out the bedroom window I saw a bright light in the distance which appeared to be an aircraft. The dogs continued barking towards the phone pole across the street, about thirty feet away. I went to the door to see what the dogs were barking at. I saw an elongated object which I thought was an aircraft but it was completely silent. The object moved slowly towards the northeast and the dogs continued barking until it disappeared. The first sound above or other than the dogs barking was that of the object. The silence was eerie, the only sounds being the barking of the dogs. It was difficult to gauge the size of the object as there were no reference points except the trees. A slow pulsating or blinking light appeared to be on the object. I went to call the sheriff to report the incident but when I returned the object had disappeared. The dogs became quiet.

The call seemed to be quite about 8 to 10 inches above the ground, never completely rising except when it moved off to the northeast. It was at this time that I heard what sounded like a faint humming noise, which seemed to be coming from the object. I concluded this to be a tape recorded voice. We are from what you call "okie" a little town. I have heard of flying saucers before but this is the first time I have seen one. All three dogs barked into the vehicle and then became quiet. The silence was even more eerie when the craft disappeared.

It was about 15 to 20 minutes that I observed the object before it disappeared. 

It was a cool night when it arrived. When I went back to work I of course I had convinced myself it was some sort of aircraft and thought no more about it. But on arriving home from work, my wife told me that she had seen the same thing that evening while I was at work. She had been outside and when she saw the object, which appeared to be the same size as the one I had seen, it just took off at a tremendous speed and disappeared. She said it lit up the whole yard. I could not believe what had happened.

Monday, 30 Jul 56:
I came home at approximately 11:14, fixed my radio, and went into the house to watch TV. After a few minutes, the phone rang and it was a friend of mine, he told me to go outside and take a look at the sky. Judgment told me not to but nevertheless I went over to the thing. The warmth and the appearance of the people shining which can explain why I started out. This is the incredible part of my story which Im sure will make you hard for believing me - But, being of a hopeful spirit, my experience will be proven without a doubt.
As I went out of the door I looked up and a strange craft which I noticed was hovering about 15 to 25 feet above the roof of the house next door. My heart felt like it was going to jump out of my mouth and sweat actually pouring from under my arms. The craft seemed to be transparent but an indirect and subdued but yet a dark coloration was noticeable such as a reflection of the the atoms of the metal surface. For a few seconds I would judge for we were able to view the outline of the craft clearly. It kept slightly maneuvering up and down as well as from side to side in a matter of 50 seconds - rapid movements about 15 to 25 seconds, the rest of the time it would just hover. A school bus was passing at the time and I noticed it also stopped for a few seconds to view the strange craft. After the craft had maneuvered for about a minute, it suddenly disappeared as quickly as it appeared, leaving no trace. The possibility of falling through the thing as it was so clean. I felt slightly nervous for the rest of the day, although I was able to carry on with my daily routine as usual.

The text in the document is as follows:

STATEMENT (Cont.)
When I asked them what motive or power their various craft had, I was asked if I knew anything about the usual power plants used in aircraft. I told them I was not particularly interested in the technical details but rather in the purpose and intent of their visits. This seemed to puzzle them and a short, blunt person said in a negative way "Intention?" I expressed my interest in learning something of their purpose here and who they were. The person said in a rather offhand manner "We come here" and gave me the following word grouping which I put down phonetically:

"Plead Verada VOE-DEE - Deal deis dominick - sound and sound the ravela pin - 0-593 + 2 x by the 500th power" 

On the various scoops or scutes on the craft I noticed markings, most of which were blacked out. I was the mother ship or "mother line" which was on two screens at once. The screen nearest me showed a larger craft which dwarfed the one I saw, and another smaller one near it. I was told in length and it has 17 decks. The person told me that it was a "hanger and assembling place" and that at all times it was fully occupied.

I was told that all the statistics I see here today I should not divulge as they are classified. I was given to understand that you may have or receive duplicates, from somewhere else, so I will just give you in detail what was told to me.

San Fernando Valley, when I looked at the time of my return, I noticed the time to be 6:25 PM. The temperature was 95 degrees. When I drove home at 8:30 PM the temperature was 75 degrees. The humidity seemed to be of a very high nature.

The entity talking to me was a person who had no emotion - his face was absolutely without expression. What he communicated to me seemed to be considered nonsense. The fact that two other people in this area have described exactly what I saw convinces me that this is a stark clear reality.

MISS-IPFG-1473-56 | PAGE 1 of 1
1. During a visit to a ranch near Van Nuys, California, on or about 6 July 1953, a local citizen claimed to have observed the fall and landing of an unidentified objet' t in a field. A bushksha ft containing' approximately 1 cubic yard of dirt and small stones was found at the site, which the citizen asserted had not existed prior to the incident. The object, which the citizen could not identify, was discovered buried under about 2 feet of dirt about 30 yards from the center of the brushksha ft depression. The citizen claimed he had produced two drawings which he had reproduced from memory; however, these drawings could not be located. In view of the citizen's claim, the incident was reported and the area investigated. This investigation, however, failed to reveal any tangible evidence to substantiate the citizen's story. The investigators noticed the date there was a depression in the field, which appeared to be about 2 feet deep and 4 feet in diameter. They could find no additional evidence to indicate any unusual activity had taken place at the site.
7. The citizen who had reported the incident was contacted on the morning of 14 August 1953, approximately one month after his original report. He stated that on the previous evening (13 August) at approximately 10:30 PM, he had observed an unidentified object hovering near his home, but that it disappeared before he could get a satisfactory view of it. He further stated that he had not prepared any drawings since his original report and that he would be unable to furnish any additional information or evidence regarding the incident. In view of the lack of tangible evidence, the matter was considered closed,

A 129-1758-17-57 SHEET 14 OF 14

15 JULY 1956

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFOS)

CONCLUSIONS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. It is the conclusion of the preparing officer that this is a case of MISTAKEN IDENTIFICATION, A HOAX.

SOURCE is a very congenial and sincere young man but he does appear to be HIGHLY IMAGINATIVE.

SOURCE stated in all sincerity that immediately following his "siting" he consulted his wife and she told him that she knew it was only his imagination playing tricks on him. However, in his own mind, he is firmly convinced that these objects were actual.

SOURCE is a very sound sleeper and extremely difficult to wake up.

It is the striking physical evidence coupled with the fact that SOURCE is a very sound sleeper and extremely difficult to wake up.

There is a possibility of collaboration with to publicize his siting, as similar reports were received by the local newspaper at the same time as the siting. However, this factor does not change the conclusion that this is a MISTAKEN IDENTIFICATION, A HOAX.

GO-MINUTES OF APPROVING OFFICER:

I concur in the conclusion of the approving officer that this siting was a MISTAKEN IDENTIFICATION, A HOAX. 

It is being returned to the originator under separate cover for further analysis.

SUBJECT - REPORT FROM: AFOIN-AEB
REGARDING sightings and incident in Van Nuys, California in subject matter. Message in three parts:
Part One: Summarizes the investigative request interview and/or preliminary investigation of unidentified aerial/UFO sighting reported to ATIC via long distance phone calls on 31 July. Received by duty officer who in turn, apparently contacted Col. Mitchell, Chief, ATIC western office, Pasadena, California, for informal checkup. Sighting is without doubt a hoax, but certain events have made it necessary that sighting be reported through channels for filing purposes.
Part Two: Brief summary of sighting. According to [redacted] voluntary report, unidentified silver-colored aircraft landed from sky onto his residence grounds on 16 July, splitting tree during descent. Three six-foot creatures emerged from vehicle, and conversed with witness by means of voice-like recordings, then departed. Space vehicle rose on [redacted] into sky.

Part Three: Background information. Col Mitchell made telephone contact with (redacted) merely to effect an informal interview and obtain some impression or source. He was found to be extremely uncooperative and hostile. Press reporters and TV be present. Obviously a planned publicity stunt. Consequently, Col Mitchell called ATIC explaining situation. Was advised not to pursue matter further. However, opinion of this Center is that (redacted) will undoubtedly give story to newspapers that Air Force is a nuisance and contacted him on sighting. Recommend Col Mitchell or unit be contacted by your nearest ATIS unit for disposition of witnesses if possible and that they be submitted to ATIC as soon as possible in order that they be passed on to AFOIS and OCAE PIO as material to counter any adverse publicity that may arise regarding this matter.

Subject: Request for Analysis - Turf Allegedly Burnt by "Flying Saucer" (Continued)

TO: AFOIN-4E2e    FROM: AFOIN-4Xc (Howard C. Cross)      DATE: 7 Feb 57         COMMENT NR 3

Through: I. G. Whitchet Egna 2/1/57

A careful examination was made of the two samples of turf submitted.

The sample of normal turf from the surrounding area consisting of a small amount of sandy soil on which was growing the creeping herb Dichondra repens Forest. var. carolinensis (Michx.) Choisy. This species grows on wet pineland, low grounds, and as a weed in lawns from Florida to Texas and north to southern Virginia and Arkansas. It is not known whether it is also found in lawns in California.

The sample of the burned turf from the depression also consisted of sandy soil on which were growing a few dead leaves and stems, presumably of the same species. No evidence was found indicating that the specimens must have been collected in midsummer or later. 

The other sample or the burned turf from the depression also consisted of sandy soil on which no plants were growing, but the remains and many of the fruits (akenes) of Dichondra were scattered, indicating that the plants had been burned. The leaves also fragments of another but unidentified species of plant, presumably a tree or shrub. Such leaf fragments are not present in the uncharred specimen.

The samples were checked for radioactivity. There was no difference between the two samples, and both showed normal radioactivity.

Samples of both the normal and burned turf were examined spectrographically. As a preparation, the samples were dried at 110 C, ground to a fine mesh, and quartered. The organic matter sample was then ashed by ignition at 500 degrees, and the dried and ignited portions were subjected to spectrographic analysis.

There were approximately 21 elements found in the two samples, and 20 of those appeared to be present in similar amounts. The two samples appeared to be different with respect to lead and cobalt contents. The normal or unburned sample showed less than .001 per cent cobalt and less than .005 per cent lead. The burned sample showed .05 to 0.2 per cent of both cobalt and lead, both higher than the normal sample.

Various possible explanations for the observed differences in cobalt and lead contents have been considered, but there is no apparent method of confirming any of these suppositions.

In the case of cobalt, this element is known to be found in soils, but the amount of .005 per cent is in excess of that known to occur naturally. It could indicate the presence of cobalt compounds in the samples taken in adjacent areas. Cobalt does not act as either a fungicide or insecticide, so probably was not present as a result of spraying of this area.

Subject: Request for Analysis - Turf Allegedly Burnt by "Flying Saucer" (Continued)
TO: AFOIN-4E2c (G. A. Hangle)  FROM: AFOIN-4X4 (Howard G. Gross)  DATE: 7 Feb 57  COMMENT NR 3 (Continued)

Sampled: The metal contents of various crude oils does not seem to explain the presence of cobalt in the charred sample as a residual from burning of a material. It is indicated that cobalt in the present in most crude oils in an order of magnitude greater than for cobalt, and these metals were not observed either to differ in the two samples or to be present in so large an amount as was indicated for cobalt in the charred sample.

If the charred sample were taken in an area where trash containing some cobalt glass had been dropped, cobalt in the amounts found might be possible.

The lead content in the charred sample might have occurred as a result of spraying of the sampled area using an insecticide such as arsenate of lead or by the burning of a lead-containing fuel such as leaded gasoline. No indications have been found of normal lead compounds in the amounts observed in this charred sample examined.

This comment is considered to have fulfilled the request of Comment Nr 1 dated January 18, 1957. The portions of the samples remaining are enclosed herewith.

TO AFOIN-4X2x	FROM Western Office	DATE 6 Aug 56
1.	Reference is made to telephone call from Captain Kalmua, ATIC, on Tuesday, 31 July 1956, regarding a report of UFO by Mr. Van Nuys, California.
2.	At the request of Captain Kalmua, this office attempted on 1 August 1956, to make preliminary investigation regarding the reported object. Telephone inquiry to Mr. ___________ revealed essentially the following:
"On the night of 15 July, I went to bed about 10:30 P.M. and was awakened at or about 11:25 P.M. by a very bright light passing over my house, drifting very slowly.  It appeared to be completely noiseless until it landed in the top of a tree about 300 yards back of my house.  It wedged itself into the tree and split it open.  Two or three guys got out of the ball and talked to me on a tape recorder. They were there only a few minutes until one of my dogs began to bark into the wrist of his microphone and instantly disappeared.  As the ball drifted up it was glowing red hot. This occurred at about 3:20 A.M. on 16 July.  I was awakened again at or about 3:30 P.M. that same day and again I saw the whole thing repeat itself with the ball returning to the same tree and disappearing in the same manner."
3.	Immediately following the the telephone inquiry from this office, Mr. __________ called certain personnel in the CBS Television network in the Los Angeles area, reporting that the Air Force was to investigate the incident.

COMMENT NO. 1  MY CONTROL: 99117/2263/A 37

Following is an extract from SDO Capt. Helmis' report of 11 Jul 1 Aug 56 for your information and necessary action. The ATIC Form 164 is attached.

WILCOC ltr. Received a long distance call from Mr. St. Van Nuys, California, Phone Santa Monica 7-0828 to report as follows: "On 16 Jul 56 at approximately 8:30 pm, I observed a round object with a golden glow heading toward a large tree in my yard. It kept coming and stopped, finally hitting the tree and falling to the ground. I went out to the ball and announced that they were from Venus. When they talked to me (I did not see them, I could only hear them) they entered the ball. It was about 5 ft in dia, closed the door and went straight up. It seemed to be doing it by remote control." I did not investigate this further since it was completely out of my thoughts. I did a pretty good job too, until I last night I started pulling out this old report and after inspecting it again I was completely fascinated by its nature, including a ride in a small metallic object about the size of a regulation football. It was round in shape and had no visible portholes or window and made no noise but took off straight up at a fantastic speed and it maneuvered above the tree tops in my yard and hovered for three seconds only. At first, I was not too interested in this story to investigate and at least examining his broken tree branch. However, I diplomatically marked off as a silly story to quickly forget. But as I think about it now, I believe I should report it to ATIC for any necessary action they may deem proper. I do not know this individual but I am sure he was pretty sincere in his report.

UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 1-c, 14,602d AISS
AIS-UFuB-473-56  PART ONE

I. SOURCE: MR. 
Address: 
Age: 25
Occupation: Property and Scenery Technician (television)
Columbia Broadcasting System, 4525 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, Part Time Artist

Education: 12 years college (liberal arts) Syracuse University, N.Y. 

Qualifications: None

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE appears to be a sincere young man with above average intelligence for his age. His description of what he saw appears to be conscientious, and probably accurate. He was hesitant to talk about his experience as he felt he would be considered an "eccentric". However, he did relate details which might corroborate his story. The interviewer's impression is that SOURCE either honestly believes he lived the experience or he is willing to cooperate to the extent he actually saw something unusual in the sky.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING AND EVENTS:
On the evening of 15 August 1956, SOURCE was awakened by a sound he thought to be a "sonic boom". Immediately after SOURCE heard the sound, his bedroom light went out. He observed through the window three ball-like objects hovering over the distant horizon at medium altitude. The objects were illuminated from within and were highly maneuverable. After watching the objects for approximately 5 to 10 minutes, they combined into a single white light that rapidly accelerated to the north and disappeared from sight within 2 or 3 seconds. SOURCE estimated the time of the total sighting to be about 60 seconds. The three ball-like objects were approximately 150 feet away from him to the north. When the objects combined into a single light, it was approximately 200 to 300 feet away. The white light that rapidly accelerated to the north was estimated to be approximately 500 feet away. SOURCE had previously been in the Air Force and was familiar with jet aircraft, but stated that the objects he saw were unlike any aircraft he had ever seen before. The motion and speed of the objects were completely different from any type of aircraft. SOURCE felt the objects could not have been a reflection of any known aircraft. The source was startled by the incident and broke a glass as he sought to get a better view. He immediately checked the house to see if his wife and children were safe, and they were sleeping normally. The next morning SOURCE discussed the incident with his wife, who stated she had not been awakened and knew nothing of the incident. SOURCE added that no other neighbors reported seeing the objects. SOURCE first saw the objects through his bedroom window, and shortly thereafter he stepped out into the backyard to get a better view. The objects were still visible as he stepped outside, and appeared to be approximately 150 feet away. The source stated that he has never before or since seen any objects similar to those he observed on that night.

AT APPROXIMATELY 9:40 P.M. ON JULY 6, 1956, A LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTY WAS PATROLLING NEAR VAN NUYS, CALIFORNIA, WHEN HE OBSERVED A LUMINOUS OBJECT MOVING ERRATICALLY ACROSS THE SKY. THE OBJECT WAS REPORTEDLY ELLIPTICAL IN SHAPE AND GAVE OFF A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT.

THE DEPUTY STOPPED HIS CAR AND WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. HE REPORTED THAT IT SEEMED TO MOVE SILENTLY AND CHANGE DIRECTIONS ABRUPTLY. AS HE CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THE OBJECT, IT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.

THE DEPUTY IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO HIS STATION. OFFICERS WERE DISPATCHED TO THE AREA BUT WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE OBJECT UPON THEIR ARRIVAL.

THIS INCIDENT WAS INVESTIGATED AND REPORTED BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK, THE AIR FORCE'S OFFICIAL PROGRAM FOR INVESTIGATING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS.

Part I - Introduction
This report covers the investigation and analysis of all unidentified aerial objects reported to the Air Force during the calendar year 1956. The data was compiled and analyzed by the Office of Special Investigations, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Part II - Analysis of Sightings
A total of 1,060 reports of unidentified aerial objects were received and investigated during 1956. Of these, 303 were classified as IDENTIFIED, 211 as INSUFFICIENT DATA, and 546 as UNIDENTIFIED.

The IDENTIFIED cases were found to be conventional aircraft, balloons, astronomical bodies, and other natural phenomena. The INSUFFICIENT DATA cases lacked enough information to permit adequate analysis and classification.

The UNIDENTIFIED cases, totaling 546, were those in which a reasonable explanation could not be determined based on the data available. These cases were subjected to the most intensive investigation and analysis.

Part III - Conclusions and Recommendations
The analysis of the 1956 sightings data has led to the following conclusions:

1. A significant number of sightings, approximately 50% of the total, remain UNIDENTIFIED after investigation.
2. The UNIDENTIFIED sightings exhibit features or exhibit characteristics which are beyond the capability of present-day aircraft and do not conform to known natural phenomena.
3. Further study of the UNIDENTIFIED sightings is warranted to attempt to determine the nature and origin of the objects observed.

Recommendations:
1. Continued collection and analysis of reports of unidentified aerial objects.
2. Expansion of investigative resources and capabilities to improve data collection and analysis.
3. Closer coordination with civilian organizations engaged in similar research.

Part One

From thinking about the incident. ... By 19 July 1956, SOURCE had almost convinced himself that his imagination was playing tricks on him. He, at approximately 1430 hours, had sighted an object in the sky which he described as being approximately 12 inches over the rear of his house. SOURCE immediately alerted his neighbor and they both observed the object which was a bright silver color, oval in shape, and appeared to be hovering. The object then made a quick, swiftly rising, vertical ascent and disappeared. SOURCE then called the police to inquire if they had received any other reports on the sighting, but the police stated they had received no other calls.
The object was reportedly sighted by two other persons who were in the area at the time, but SOURCE has been unable to establish contact with them to verify their observations. SOURCE refused to be interviewed and gave no address. The article published the next day 20 July 1956 in the local newspaper reported the SOURCE as a "VALLEYITE" (resident of the San Fernando Valley).
For a further aerial activity the incident, the article states that on 29 July 1956, OURCE received a telephone call from an unidentified person who claimed to have witnessed the sighting on 19 July 1956. The anonymous caller mentioned that on the day of the sighting, he had been in the area and had observed the object at approximately the same time as SOURCE. The caller stated that he was in a private plane at the time and saw the object very close.  He told OURCE that the object made a swift vertical ascent and had disappeared from view. SOURCE was unable to obtain any further information from the caller, as he refused to identify himself.
SOURCE experienced an extreme hunger sensation which caused him to fill up on food, although SOURCE stated he was not hungry at the time. SOURCE believes this sensation was a psychological reaction to the incident.

A: "Was it history you read that makes you speak so?"
Q: "Any from Russia?"
A: "No, his evil government, your country has an evil government too."  
DOCTOR noticed that one of the view screens on the wall had a constant record showing a planet in the process of being denuded as though stripped. The planet was being pulled apart bit by bit, apparently with some immensely powerful explosive force that seemed to be directed without the use of physical equipment. "It was fifteen hundred (1,500) earth years to construct. it was broken up in a moment."
