Missile Expert Reveals Seeing 'Flying Saucer'

Naval Lab Expert Tells of Seeing Craft

By WILLIAM J. BRADY

A Naval Research laboratory guided missiles expert yesterday described a "flying saucer" he and two fellow-scientists had observed June 29 near White Sands, New Mex., but admitted his unofficial report to Army officers there drew only fish-eye glances.

Glare in the Sky

Dr. C. J. Zohn, 400 block Melton St. SE., was in New Mexico to observe a V-2 launching test for the Navy. Four days before the test, he and Curtis C. Rockwood, also attached to the research laboratory, and John J. Kauke, stationed at the White Sands testing area, were driving a short distance from the launching site.

"Kauke suddenly spotted [Turn to Page 2, Col. 6]
a glare in the 'sky," Zohn said. "We all looked up and saw a silvery disc whirling through the unclouded sky.

"We watched the disk for per- [Continued on Page 2]

officials developed the following theories about the strange objects:
1. They may be a mirage produced by mass self-hypnosis, similar to the speed serpents often reported seeing from motorcycles on a Navy guided missiles test recalled a sky phenomena reported during the air warn Europe.

American pilots said they saw intgrated balls of fire which disappeared along planes in a flash of explosion smoke. A thorough investigation uncovered no basis for the reports.

2. The flying saucers are optical illusions, say some of the tricks the eye play upon the brain. Sometimes particles of dust banged about on the air suspended by the blindness of the sun near-by certain clouds.

Double Air Missile

So far as is known, no guided missile has been developed which can travel more than 300 miles under its own power. For this reason, Army and Navy officers doubted the object, if they do exist, were launched from any foreign country.

Dr. Zuvicky, astrophysicist professor at California Institute of Technology, of Ordance, in current issue is warned in the publication of the Army Ordnance Association, a semi-official group of industrialists and others interested in military weapons, said scientists were preparing to shoot "artificial meteors" to explore the secrets of the skies. These mock meteors, however, would be launched from rockets to eescape the grip gravity of the earth, and never return. Scientists explained they could rec- be mistaken for "flying saucers."

TO: Commanding General
Air Materiel Command
Wright-Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio
ATTN: TICAO

1. Reference is made to the letters from your Headquarters to this station of 22 November 1946, 6 December 1946, and 14 January 1949, Subject "Project SIGN" *, requesting that reported incidents I through 172 be analyzed to determine whether or not these might have been caused by balloons launched by these laboratories.

2. A listing has been compiled of all balloons launched by these laboratories and first contractors for special stratospheric research purposes, from the first such launching to no. 101 on 17 November 1948. Each of these launchings has been compared with the reported incidents I through 172. Factors of comparison were dates of launching and dates and places of recovery with respect to time and place of occurrence of reported possible observations from the listed incidents. A descending velocity factor was taken for each type of balloon with respect to the place of reported incidents. So that your office may make an independent analysis, three copies of the launching list are included.

a. Incidents No. 5 through No. 16 reported on 4 July 1947 throughout Oregon, Idaho and Washington gave, in general, descriptions of clusters or groups of objects. The 3 July 1947 balloon Launchings No. 6 at Alamogordo was a cluster of balloons and was not recovered, and so might be suspected of being the cause of these reports. However, although not recovered, this flight was confirmed in the Fort Sumner Valencia Valley only a few miles northwest of Alamogordo. That the balloons were down was determined both by airplane spotting and by radio direction finding upon the balloon telemetering instruments. Recovery of the balloons and instruments was prevented by the inaccessibility of this terrain.

b. Balloon releases No. 11 of 7 July 1947 could compare with respect to date with incident No. 1 through No. 4, and again with incident No. 10. This balloon flight was again a cluster.

AFS WP-291 Dept. of the Air Force
Ltr, ETEL, to CG, AMC, Subj: Analysis of Project "Grudge" Reported Incidents.

a. Incident No. 17 is reported in connection with an unusual air traffic communication problem on 10 Apr 49 between two CAA controlled aircraft in the vicinity of Las Cruces, N. Mex. Both CAA and AACS had been trying to contact the CAA flight service station at Albuquerque, N. Mex. Full details n these attempts and the complete $64 question with respect to CAA facilities and operating practices of this Albuquerque point could try to be ruled out as aggressors.

b. Incident No. 47 compares event in this with balloon launching on 10 of 5 July 1948. However, balloon No. 10 although not recovered was sent to secure the Canada characteristics of launching. Protective co-ance where burst to expectancy of torn balloon. Incident No. 115 is a reasonable description of the IQ Series plastic balloons that includes tethered lights characteristics this incident on was after the balloon accident No. 163 of 7 April 1945 at Albuquerque. However, this event or the reported incident (2005 CDT) is about 1/2 hour before the timing of balloon release (1413 MST). Thus the incident could not have been that balloon.

c. It is of interest to note that incident No. 122 was reported by an employee of these Laboratories who had considerable experience in the use of balloons of all kinds, and could have been depended upon to know this appearance and behavior of a balloon if it was who he saw.

d. Incident No. 163 bears a fair description of the appearance of a large plastic balloon in sunset light. The object's disappearance could be accounted for either by its movement into the earth's sunset shadow or by an initial defocusing of the observer'e eye. This finding logically possibly have been balloon release No. 75 or No. 76 on 20 or 21 July 1945 at Amarillo base. Telegram 75 to the recovery at 135PDT, California, which is in thetimezone U.E. shows, on 22 July 1945 and could have readily have a trajectory which would have been within sight of the Lee Angelos area. Balloon No. 76 was never recovered. It is possible that it had a trajectory similar to No. 75.

f. All other reported incidents from 1 to 172 do not seem to have reasoneable comparison with balloons launched by these Laboratories.

3. The balloons used by these Laboratories are now somewhat standardized. They are 20 feet long, plastic, white in color, and have telephone cones in shape. Nearly all launchings are made at the balloon AFS at Alamogordo, New Mexico. Two photograph prints are enclosed showing the appearance and size of these balloons. The larger photograph shows the typical flight appearance at cry altitudes where it would be visible. It is hoped that this information may be of some use to you in identifying future reports of incidents.

5. It is suggested that these items on the questionnaire be replaced by questions which will yield answers capable of aiding in definite facts in terms of the observer's best estimate of angles and times. From data given by Chicago of the two objects at two different places, a reliable calculated estimate could be made of the object's size, distance from and path. These data should include:

6. An estimate of the angular size of the object. A quick but reasonable estimate can be made by using the "finger method" by the 51st Fighter Group at Lung Wha (3/15/47 estimate of an average man's hand at 26° to 7" [fingers length]) will subtend an angle of approximately five degrees. In this way regular size from about 1/2° to about 5° can be estimated.

7. The estimated time required for the object to traverse the observer's angle of vision, as calculated by using the finger method extended or in terms of the observer's climax rate. After the observer has made marker--end of thumb, etc.--visible to Chicago by posting two points can extend his arms toward the two pointed end above 5° or 10° and by comparison estimate the angular extent of the flight. It is most important that information which will determine these directions, relative to compass points be given. If the angular course is associated with objects on the horizon, with trees, with the sun (if the time of day is also noted) or by the north star, the orientation can be checked at 

any later time.

8. The time required for the object to traverse the observed course. This is probably more difficult estimate to make.—

With a watch is the most satisfactory, but an observer is seldom prepared to do so. Seconds can be counted with good accuracy by saying:

6. It is realized that it might not be possible for an observer to perform the operations suggested in the preceding paragraph, during the period that the object is sighted. If he would immediately recognize what he saw and then continue such measurements, he should be able to give quantitative answers to the last two items, E and F. In interrogating observers, they should also be asked to reconstruct their observations and then within the time so inferred. It is suggested that instructions for making such quick and accurate observations be given to teacher observers, control tower operators, airport police, forest and fire wardens, and other such people who might have good chance of seeing unidentified flying objects. If any information concerning unidentified flying objects is given to the public, instructions for reliable observation should be included.

7. This organization will be pleased to be of any further assistance
required in connection with this matter.

served was meteoric. The estimated ti... in si... is quite lon...;
however, and, if a meteor, this object should have had a preao..ced

10 July 1947

SUBJECT: Interview of Person Reporting Unidentified Aerial Object

TO: Ac/I Chief of Air Staff – 
   Collection Branch, AAF
   Washington 25, D. C.

1. At the request of Lt. Col. G. D. Garrett, AAF 2-2, the undersigned has interviewed this date Mr. _______ Administrative Assistant in the Rocket Sonde Section, NRL, who had previously released information to the press regarding an aerial object which he stated he saw at White Sands, New Mexico. 20 June.

2. Substance of the interview is as follows:

At between 11:00 and 11:30 E. S. Sunday, 29 June 1947, Mr. _______, in the company of the following: Mr. ________, NRL Rocket Sonde Section telemetering expert; Mr. ________, NRL Rocket Sonde high altitude spectrograph scientist; and Mrs. ________ wife of the latter, were proceeding along Highway 17 in a north-easterly direction from Las Cruces, New Mexico to White Sands V-2 firing grounds in an automobile driven by Mr. ________. At some time between those views and about one-third of the distance from Las Cruces to the White Sands V-2 firing grounds, Mr. ________ noticed at some distance in front, and above of the other occupants, Mr. ________ opened the window nearest him and observed the object moving at an unknown rapid velocity at an unknown altitude, which he estimated at about 10,000 feet, and which Mr. _______, who also observed it through an open window, estimated at between 6,000 and 10,000 feet, although the former put little credence in the estimates.

When first sighted the object was to the right and forward of the automobile at an elevated elevation and was apparently moving horizontally in a northerly direction such as to cross the highway from right to left. The object was observed by all persons in the automobile. Mr. ________ stated that he could not observe any details of the object other than that its shape was uniform, with no protuberance such as the wings of an airplane. It was too distant to enable stereoscopic visualization. There was apparently some major specular reflection which seemed to change in intensity as the object receded until it was lost for eight after an estimate 30 seconds, from the time first noticed. He could not explain how it disappeared except perhaps that the reflection angle may have changed abruptly. There were apparently no clouds or visibility obstructions at the time. The sun was to the rear of the automobile. Mr. ________ thought that at one time he saw vapor trails.

WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

28 July 1947

Dear Sir:

SUBJECT: Flying Saucers

Commander Chief of Air Staff-22
Collection Branch, AF
Washington 25, D.C.

Supplemental to the com nicat'in I submit to your office,
dated 10 July 1947, I now desire to reo--t on additional
date hereafter obtained by other sources. It has been reported
that large numbers of people in this locality, a more detailed
number of whom was obtained on 24 July from _____ who mentioned
it in a letter written to me, have also been the observers.

The report she objects to have been either a silvery
sphere or kite which she would have taken to be a meteorological balloon
except for the fact that it did not rise into the air but remained
higher than the automobile and moved always at the same level. The auto-
mobile was moving about [50 mph -"Mach I" is written in the margin]. When in Las Vegas, N.M.
June 24 at 5 A.M.

There before was it in a location of 2 about ____ ft. It appeared some of
the time as if it could be a ball. There was nothing above the level of the
city. It might look or compare.

It darted or toward the east, then again, west and so on. The
circular motion was generally elliptically horizontal. Its speed did not change
so far as could be observed during the time of observation. He thought
it disappeared by simply becoming too thin to see.
