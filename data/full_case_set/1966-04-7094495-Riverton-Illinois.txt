11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Witness sighted a bright red light moving SE from his position. Object then appeared to slow in mid air and reverse direction and proceeded to the NW. It disappeared gradually to the NW. No sound was heard.
The lights conformed to standard aircraft lighting. The sound emitted by an aircraft would not be heard due to the strong surface wind at the 1000 FT level blowing the sound away from the area. Many light aircraft travel over that area.

IN SPRINGFIELD AND THE DECATUR MUNICIPAL AIRPORT.
BECAUSE OF THE STRONG WIND AT THE 1200 FT LEVEL, THE
PAGE A QUESTION IS UNCLASSIFIED SINCE
SOUND EMITTED BY AN AIRCRAFT WOULD BE BLOWN AWAY FROM THE OBSERVER.
THE OVERCASE CONDITION IN THE AREA WOULD MAKE IT
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE SAFE OF THE OBJECT.
THE DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT FROM THE OBSERVER IS
QUESTIONABLE. THE WITNESS IS APPARENTLY VERY RELIABLE SINCE HE
DOES HAVE EXCELLENT KNOWLEDGE OF HELICOPTERS, WEATHER BALLOONS,
AIRCRAFT IN GENERAL AND A FAIR BACKGROUND OF SCIENCE.
IT APPEARS THAT THE OBJECT WAS A LIGHT AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA. 
IT WOULD BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FACTATE THIS.
(1) NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE EXISTS.
(1) I FEEL FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS UNWARRANTED.
