Subject: Two unexplained brilliant lights sighted in the sky.

Mrs. _____ and myself were taking an evening stroll around the house on Hatton Drive to talk for a few minutes. At about 10:20 p.m. our attention was attracted to the sky by two brilliant lights that seemed to be stationary in the sky about (Rev. - or my work which I follow say about) 300-400 feet up. They were moving very slowly around to look out but didn't see anything and went on about our business. The lights looked to be about the size of a baseball and had a thin cloud which was alone in the sky and was nearly overhead. We watched the lights for about 20 minutes until they disappeared and it was about 10:40 p.m. when we went back into the house. There was no noise, no exhaust trail, and no other lights around except for the two. The reflection of movement of the two lights on the thin cloud which was alone in the sky was plainly visible. We have no idea of what the lights were but it was a strange sight as they just seemed to drift around with no sound or trail. Both myself and Mrs. _____ were impressed by the strange behavior of the lights and could not explain what we saw.

The text in the document reads as follows:

The first one seemed to come down to what I guess may have seen about 10,000 feet. It seemed to be about 15 or 20 feet in diameter, a brilliant white light and reddish-orange on the outer edges. It came down a little ways and stopped and hovered there for a few seconds and then zoomed straight up again at a terrific speed. They both came down again, the second one is a little smaller, but a brilliant white light. They both came down again, the second one is a little smaller, but a brilliant white light. They both seemed to be about 2 or 3 degrees of arc and then went straight up. I am not sure whether they are third line or not. I am suspect to say that I have not had this verified by the ARDC and I reported the incident to Lt. Andrews requested that this report be accompanied by some personal information so that the authenticity of the report can be evaluated.

I am 35 years old, a registered professional engineer in private practice. During World War II, I was a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy and served for four years, graduating from Leigh in mechanical engineering. Since the war, I have been employed in aerospace dynamics, flight test engineering, and as an instructor for the CAA.

Severna Park, Md.
20 September 1957

COMMANDANT 4151 AIRBASE WING
ATTENTION: 2D Lt. ANDREWS
ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

SUBJECT: Sighting of two unidentified flying objects in sky on 14 August 1957, at 7:53 p.m. (Daylight Saving Time) from Severna Park, Maryland.

As a minister I am accustomed to believing on evidence. I consider sufficient the reasons given in this letter to conclude that I actually saw two unidentified flying objects at 7:53 p.m., Daylight Saving Time, on 14 August 1957, from Severna Park, Maryland.

I was facing west and my two companions were facing south when we first observed the objects. They appeared to be a bright light high in the sky, like two small stars close together. We watched them for several minutes as they maintained their position, stationary, and then one of them started to move slowly to the left. After moving a short distance, it returned to its original position. This movement was repeated several times by the one object, while the other remained stationary. As they disappeared behind some trees, the moving object changed course slightly and descended below the horizon.

There was no sound that we could hear, and no vapor trail was visible. The objects appeared to be self-luminous, but not of the intensity of a star. They were larger than stars and were not twinkling. In the clear sky of that August evening they stood out distinctly.

I have never before seen flying objects that behaved in this manner, and I am at a loss to account for what we observed. I am sure it was not an airplane, nor any other known aircraft. I have no reason to doubt the trustworthiness of my companions, who are members of my church and community, and the members of Baltimore County, Maryland. I am 45 years old, and a minister in the Methodist Church. I am married and the father of three children.

Respectfully submitted,
[Signature Redacted]
Minister, Methodist Church

Dear Air,

The air past the objects which we saw on Aug 19 at 10:00 PM. 
The colors etc. were much brighter and had a blue tint, but 
DDG were the brightest objects. 
I'd seen them near to the sky.

For a 35 mm old movie projector we command a Dufaycolor
as a fitting match as I'm sure you recognize they were just the same
make of this nature.

Yours truly,

Case material: Case indicated â€” flying 1957 Severna Park, Md. 9:45. 9/15.

1. The following amounts are suggested:
a. The question may be asked bluntly:
Just what is it that the people actually observed?
b. Although helpful and of course we want to know the names and addresses of witnesses, we do not want to emphasize this - the observation comes first.
c. Might the actual sighting be remembered in greater detail by a second interview with the witness?
d. Were any sound or noise associated with it observed that might give clue as to the nature of the sighting?
e. If true, this would give additional detail and possibly indicate nature of object. However, we do not want to suggest this, but let the witness report this if it is a fact.
f. If more information is deemed necessary, suggest follow up interview - but let the report indicate any additional detail without leading the witness.
