UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Joliet, Illinois
Date: 31 MAY 60
Time: (2)
Description: Cause was a luminous source sighted for about 5-10 minutes. It made no sound and there was no odor.
Direction of Motion: S.E. to N.W.
Duration: ABOUT 5-10 MIN.
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): POSSIBLE STAR
Radar Analysis (ARGON-421): N/A.
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.):
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: NONE
Other:
Evaluation of Source Reliability: PROBABLE GOOD
Analysis and Conclusions: The source of this object is not definitely known, but it was observed to have several characteristics in common with reported UFOs. Specifically it was a luminous body, it moved directionally, and remained visible for a prolonged period. HOWEVER, ITS APPEARANCE AND MOTION WERE ALSO CONSISTENT WITH KNOWN ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENA, SUCH AS A BRIGHT STAR OR PLANET. THEREFORE, IT IS PROBABLY AN ORDINARY NATURAL PHENOMENON, THOUGH THE POSSIBILITY OF IT BEING A UFO CANNOT BE COMPLETELY EXCLUDED.

INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS OF ONE M.
At 0315Z hours, 1 June 1960, I set out to obtain a telescopic picture of the moon. He observed a very bright and star-like object, and as he studied Jupiter with the telescope, he did feel that to the casual observer, the planet Jupiter could present a similar object. However, he did feel that to the casual observer, the planet Jupiter could present a similar object. However, he did feel that to the casual observer, the object he observed could present a similar object to that of Jupiter. The period of observation was discontinued after 0400Z hours, 1 June 1960, due to cloud formation obscuring the view.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document with text describing the planet Jupiter.

Subject: Planet Jupiter
References: Encyclopedia Americana Vol 16, 1956 Edition and Encyclopedia Britannica Vol 13, 1956 Edition.
Description: With the exception of the Sun, Jupiter is the largest member of the Solar System. It is a giant gaseous planet, much larger than the Earth. Its diameter is nearly 11 times that of the Earth. Jupiter's shape is elliptical with a polar flattening of about 1/15 its diameter. The latitude of Jupiter is about 44% which means a high reflectivity of incident light making it often the brightest object in the night sky. It is yellow with several narrow parallel belts of different color. A slight darkening of the limb farthest from the sun can be observed.

Braidwood Sees Object in Sky
Braidwood was kept awake Tuesday night as residents peered at a bright object in the southern sky.
An AF Jet interceptor from Truax Field, Milwaukee, Wis. was sent to the area early today to investigate.
It was finally determined that two celestial bodies were putting on their brightest show of the year.
William Gomora, Reed Township Supervisor and a member of the Will County Civil Defense Committee, notified the bright object in the southern sky which was there from about 9 p.m. Tuesday until daybreak today.
Gomora called Robert McFadden, Will County Civil Defense Director, who notified the FFA and the Air Defense Command about the bright object seen in the Braidwood area. Gomora was on the telephone almost 2 hours while the plane circled.
Robert F. Price, head of the Physics and Astronomy Departments at Joliet Junior College, when called early today regarding the mysterious "flying object", said apparently either Jupiter or Saturn was putting on a bright show. He said Jupiter was the brighter of the two.

UFO REPORT
TYPE OF SIGHTING: Latter part of April or early part of May 1960
PLACE OF SIGHTING: Near Joliet, Illinois
OBSERVER: A grade high school student
DURATION OF OBSERVATION: About 5 minutes
DISTANCE OF OBJECT: Estimated between 5,000 and 8,000 feet
SIZE OF OBJECT: About the size of a sewing needle
COLOR: Silver metallic (shiny)
SHAPE: No apparent visible
ALTITUDE: Estimated at between 5,000 and 8,000 feet
SPEED: Object did not appear to move appreciably in relation to the observer
FACTS: I was waiting for the bell to ring so I could go on to my 6th hour class. I heard what was similar to the sound of a jet in the distance and decided to wait by the shop bench until the bell rang. I looked out the shop door window and realized this was not a jet since the object remained stationary in the sky. I watched the object carefully and found the sky to be clear with only a few cirrus clouds. It appeared to be a speck in the window glass but after a closer look I realized it was stationary in the sky, maintaining a horizontal position which did not change throughout the observation. I moved from where I was standing to another close position and the object was still stationary in the same place. It was stationary in the sky, maintaining a horizontal position, about the size of a sewing needle. I moved back to where I was standing and the object was still maintained in the same position. I was unable to go outside via the shop door as it was kept locked most of the time, except for the possible access that it did not know what I was looking at. From the vantage point of this window, which is in the southeast, this object would be visible in the southwest. During a portion of this time, I was watching the clock on the opposite shop wall in order to determine the duration of the sighting, which was approximately 5 minutes. Since the object would be silhouetted against the sky, I found the color to be silver metallic. The object remained stationary all the time of my observation and I was unable to make any conclusions as to what this object was except that it was unlike any object I had seen before. At the time of my sighting, I was not aware of any current UFO activity, nor did I make any conclusions as to what this object may have been.

FEB - 6 1967

Dear Sir:

Reference your letter of January 6, 1967 reporting a 1960 unidentified flying object (UFO) observation.

At such late date, a comprehensive study would be extremely difficult, since records of air activity have normally deteriorated to a point where it would be impossible to determine the actual stimuli. The information will be filed and added to the present data base.

Your interest in our program is appreciated.

Text from the document:

"Am fact interested in UFO reports and have read several books and articles on the subject, Since about 1950 I have been studying the subject as much as I could on my own. I have not yet come to any one conclusion on the subject but do feel that more investigation could and should be made on the subject.

After reading the January 1962 edition of Science Digest which contained two articles on UFO investigation and UFO reports I decided to send a copy of this report to the Air Force's "Project Blue Book" organization to see if any investigation could be made of this sighting. It seems organization should feel it necessary to send one of these investigators to my home for a personal interview so I could answer any and all of their questions to the best of my ability. I am presently enrolled as a student at the Detroit College of Law. My address is as follows:

Dear [redacted],
Reference your letter of 6 January 1967 reporting a 1960 unidentified flying object (UFO) observation. At such a late date, a comprehensive study would be extremely difficult. Since records of air activity are normally destroyed several months after their use, there would be practically no records to check in an attempt to determine the actual stimulus. The information will be filed and referred to the present data base.
Thank you, your interest in our program is appreciated.

In fact interested in UFO Reports and have several books and articles on the subject. I have not yet come to any definite opinion on the subject but I do feel that a great deal of scientific investigation could and should be made on the subject. After reading the February 1957 edition of Science Magazine I decided to send a copy of this report to the Air Force's Project Blue Book.

I realize that this confidential investigation could be of importance to the Air Force's Project Blue Book and I believe that it would be necessary to forward the report for their consideration as evidenced by their request to have any case reports forwarded to them for their evaluation, I am personally exceedingly anxious to be of assistance to you in any way that may be required.

"SUBJECT: TITAN MISSILE FIRING ACCIDENT
SAFOP-30/Major Hart/kd/7930
20 April 1962
Dear [Redacted],

A check of the files for 13 May 1960, as per your request, discloses the TITAN missile was fired at 2052 and contact was lost after about 200 miles. This accident appears to be unrelated to course altitudes. As there are some questions on this aspect, we have no information on course altitudes.

Although we receive a number of Brazilian sighting reports, our files contain none for 13 May 1960.

Sincerely,
G. E. HART

Dear Sir:

Your office has been very helpful in the past and so I wonder if you could answer this question for us. As you know, we missed or rocked to launched down the Atlantic Missile Range April 11, 1960, between 6:50 and 7:20 p.m.

I am trying to account for a flurry of UFO sightings that occurred in NE Brazil at that time.

Many thanks.

Very truly yours,

Scott Air Force Base
Belleville, Illinois

Dear Sirs:

During the past few years, I have been tempted to report a UFO which I have observed on several occasions. However, I was somewhat reluctant to file the report. Recently, though, I read that a renowned psychologist had undertaken a studied program of UFO investigation and that he felt that a serious study of UFO reports might be of value in his research. I have decided to report my sighting, which may be of value in his research.

At about 4:30 p.m. on May 26, 1960, I was walking east on West Main Avenue near my home. Being an air traffic buff, I noticed something unusual in the sky. I looked up and spotted the object. The object was approximately 200 yards from me, and about 75 feet above the ground. It seemed to be moving due west at a speed of about 200 yards per second. The shape of the object was similar to the silver diecast metal toy airplanes I played with as a child. The color was the same as the silver enamel paint which I used on model airplanes. My estimate was that it was 50 feet long and 30 feet high and had a rounded upper surface. I watched it for about 10 seconds as it moved in a straight line in a westerly direction. Now that I discussed shape distortion with a friend, it moved in a straight line, but seemed to distort or wobble slightly as it went. I ran back to my home about 100 yards away to get binoculars. As I reached the door, the object was gone, but I think I should have still been able to see it at the distance it was going.

Unfortunately, no one else that I know of has told you what I did which is:
I saw, on the evening of 3/22/54, at the time of 6:00 a.m. what I took to be a type of spacecraft, and since I had been a member of "ODC", and was familiar with almost all types of spacecraft, and satellites from his military service, I knew this was something strange. My sighting was from my home in Joliet, Illinois, and was observed for almost 15 mins. If you can contact me either at the above address or at my permanent residence at 144 West Naples, Joliet, Ill.

Sincerely yours,
