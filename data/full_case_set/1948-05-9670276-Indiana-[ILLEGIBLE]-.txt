There is no photograph present in the image you have provided. The image appears to be a scanned page of a document with very faded or poorly printed text that is largely illegible due to the quality of the scan or the state of the original document. However, I will do my best to transcribe what is visible:

```
----- ---------------- --------------
----- ---------------- --------------
--------------------- --------------- ---------------- ------------- -------- 
----- ---------------- --------
--------------------- --------------- ----------------------------- --------
----- ------- ---- --------------- -------- ------- ---- --------
---------- -------- -------
----- ------------------------ ------------------

------ 1 ------ -------------- --------
---------------------
--------------------------------------------

█████ FORM 94
(8-8-50)
```

The majority of the text is either redacted, obscured, or too illegible to discern. The bottom of the page has a box with the text "FORM 94 (8-8-50)" which is likely referring to some sort of standard form or document reference used by the organization that produced the document. The numbers "1,200 to 2,200" might be referring to measurements or quantities of some kind, but without context, it's impossible to be sure. Additionally, the illegibility of the document does not allow for a more complete or accurate transcription.
