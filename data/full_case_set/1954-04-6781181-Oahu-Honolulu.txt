Sources: Mr. _______, ________ Company, Honolulu,
                   Oahu, T. H., employed at a Hawaiian Sugar Company, Honolulu.

1. On the night of 16 April 1954 Mr. ________ _______ observed an unusual flying
object in the air. Interrogation of Mr. ________ by PIO Intelligence Officer
revealed the following information:

a. While at Sandy Beach which is located on the southeast shore of Oahu
on 16 April 1954 between 2200 and 2220 hours, Hawaiian Standard time, Mr.
observed a brilliant red light-like object hovering over the ocean between China and
Lanai at approximately 3,000 to 4,000 feet altitude.

b. This brilliant red light-like object remained stationary for about
one and one-half minutes, then moved at a high rate of speed in the direction
of the Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station. While the object was moving at this
rate of speed, a tail of light (like a comet's tail) was observed.

c. The U. S. Weather Station at Kaneohe International Airport revealed
that the weather in the night of 16 April was very good with wind direction north-
east at 10 to 12 knots. No ceiling and visibility was very good.

d. Pearl Harbor Rescue observed and reported that no aircraft or ships
were thought to be in the area at that time. Comm Officer the LOP Air Station reported
that a TPS-1B radar set contact to this 230 degrees bearing was lost at 4,000 feet
altitude at Kaneohe was confirmed by phone communication. The UPI was reported on the
night of 16 April. No corroborating reports has been made to date nor any credible
questions were received that would clarify the above reported sightings.
