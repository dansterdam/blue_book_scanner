The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the United States. The document is an "Air Intelligence Information Report" dated August 7, 1952, detailing a sighting of unidentified objects near Richmond, Virginia.

OCR output:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS (UFO)
LOCALITY: Near Richmond, Virginia
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 7 August 1952
SUBMITTED BY: U.S. Air Force, Fort John Custis, Va.

Persons observing the Richmond, Virginia, UFO on 7 August 1952 were Lt. David M. Groner and 2d Lt. Donald H. Ware. Their observations were made between 8:15 and 8:45 pm, EDT, while tracking a routine weather balloon release from Fort Eustis, Virginia.

The objects sighted were 3 circular brilliant lights about the size of a dime at arm's length, white in color, and traveled in a westerly direction at a fairly high rate of speed. They were slightly above the normal level of commercial air traffic. The objects were sighted for approximately 25 minutes and were last observed heading towards the horizon. The objects remained in sight for approximately one minute.

The observers stated that the only object visible to them was the distant Venus. They also noted that no jet trails or other aircraft were visible in the sky at the time. Estimations of the altitude and speed of the objects were impossible due to lack of definite reference points.

This report indicates that the Richmond sighting involved the observation of several unidentified aerial objects which could not be explained in terms of known aircraft or astronomical phenomena. The case remains unresolved.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
1. Time and Date of Observation: 1:21 a.m. 7 Aug 1952 
2. Location: Richmond, Virginia
3. Description of Object(s): At about 100 miles per hour, the object was moving very fast and appeared larger than an automobile, with a distinct fiery trail which appeared bright white in color and left a glow.
4. Course and Speed:  The object was observed over Richmond, Virginia. 37° 33' north latitude. The object was observed by Lt. and Mrs. Holguaine, Richmond, Virginia and was sighted from the ground station and as did "J". 
5. Sighting made by Army Air Force Personnel: No
6. Calling and Visibility Conditions: Partly obscured by clouds.
7. Conclusion of Two Observers: The object was the planet Venus and they believed that it was this object.
8. There is no physical evidence of the sighting. 
9. The sighting is considered to be a misidentification of the planet Venus. At 0528Z, the item associated with this sighting was described as a meteor and meteors were sighted in that time period.
10. The pilots of the fighter aircraft reported no other aircraft in the vicinity.
11. The station and said "J" believe Lt. Holguaine sighted the first object that looked just like a fighter aircraft and that this satellite might have been Venus.
12. Signed narrative statements of observers have been forwarded.
