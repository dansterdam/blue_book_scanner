10. CONCLUSION: Photo: Other (REFLECTION)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Object should have been about 30' off the ground for 25-35 seconds and then shot off the horizon at about 30 degrees and disappeared. A sound was heard. Object was about 10' ft high and about 15' ft long and seemed to be coming to a stop when it dropped on a flat surface. Photo obtained or attempt was unsuccessful. According to a reflection of a light source, the object was actually a reflection of an interior light, the diameter being likely not to exceed one or two feet.

TEXT OUTPUT:

A detailed investigation was made in this case on 7 October 1966 by B/General Richard T. Alvarez, Inspector and Deputy Director, USAF Special Activities Center. The results of this investigation are summarized as follows:

This report concerns an alleged sighting of an unidentified flying object near Minneapolis, Minnesota on 8 September 1966. The report was submitted by two of the witnesses, Robert Olson and Robert Dean, who were employed by the University of Minnesota. 

The witnesses reported that on 8 September 1966, at approximately 9:30 p.m., they were returning to Minneapolis from a trip to Stillwater, Minnesota. As they were driving northward on Highway 61, just north of the city limits of Minneapolis, they reportedly observed a brilliant light in the sky which appeared to be moving rapidly in a northwesterly direction. The light was described as being much brighter than any star or planet and seeming to change colors from white to yellow to red as it moved. The witnesses claimed that the object appeared to be round or oval in shape and seemed to be at an estimated altitude of 1500 to 2000 feet.

The object was reportedly observed for approximately three to five minutes before disappearing from sight. The witnesses stated that they stopped their automobile and watched the object intently during the period of observation. They claimed that the object appeared to be maneuvering and making abrupt changes in direction and speed. 

The witnesses also reported that, while watching the object, they noticed that their automobile engine and radio appeared to malfunction. They stated that the engine and radio were operating normally prior to the sighting and resumed normal operation after the object disappeared from view.

An investigation was made to determine if any conventional aircraft had been in the area at the time of the sighting. The Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport reported no unusual air traffic in that general area at the time. A check with the FAA and other sources failed to reveal any evidence of any known aircraft that could account for the reported observations.

In summary, the investigation has not revealed any conclusive evidence that would positively identify the object sighted. The witnesses appear to be credible and their descriptions of the object and its observed performance characteristics are not readily explainable in terms of any known conventional aircraft or other identifiable aerial phenomena.

Dear Sir: 

I know that you probably not believe me because of my age, but I saw a
UPC. Here are the facts:
A. Am/Day/Time of sightinc: October 30, 1967 at about 8:15 to 8:20 local
time/Minneapolie liinnesota. (The village of 
New Hope to be exact.)
Length of sighting: about I5 seconds.
Color: Bright yellow, so bright that it was almost white. 
Size: From approx. 1/4 the size of a small power line to approx. 1/10 the size of
the Full moon as seen by the normal observer. 
The number of people watching: the UFO was first by my son and daughter for about 6 months and I know that 
this wasn't a reguiar game or anything we 
made because I live only a short distanee 
from an airport and airplane traffic is con-
stant, and in the sky grade. We all live on the same
street.
What we can't exactly say is because we were a short distence away from
the place, but the sound about 2 inches in diameter. There was a
slight confusion in the location and no sound could be heard.
but that night became a discussion of the distance. 
Just like a first noticed it as we were watching the planes come in
for their regular evening landing. It was a bright light, much bigger
than a plane light. As it came close, the light dimmed somewnat but
still remain bright. It was plain to see that it was not a plane,
helicopter or anything we had ever seen before. As it came closer, the
thing as low as seding seemed to be going along, the power if
there, it did not want anything it went along. When the power if
gone, it just stood there, we any that it wasn't a plane, what to do,
land or takeoff, it just stood there for a while and then it just took
off toward the west and disappeared in a matter of seconds. The lights
plane does not come in to the same pattern with the same light, you
know this. And the line was stronger, with the same light, you would
say that it was an airplane, but this was so different, the lights were
strorics of light like this:
We only the lights were clos, ..

I hope that if you can find the time, you can find
out what this was. If I still left you with a question - 
Very sincerely yours,

Dear Sirs:

I am writing in response to a sighting of an unidentified flying object by my brother and his companion. I would like to provide you with the details of the incident, as I believe it could be of interest to your investigation.

According to my brother, the sighting occurred on October 7. The object was white in color and made no sound. It was approximately 2 to 3 feet in diameter and gave off a white light underneath. My brother stated that the object was hovering about 5 feet off the ground and that the weather was clear.

My brother described the object as metallic in appearance, with a rotating motion. He stated that it was visible for about 5 to 10 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view. This is consistent with the details he provided to me.

I am forwarding this information to you in the hope that it may contribute to your investigation. If you require any additional details, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

Freeman Jr., the Chief of the Civil Branch Community Relations Division of the Office of Information, responding to the recipient regarding an "unidentified flying object photo" that was provided.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mr. _____:

We have been informed by Mr. _____ that you have reconsidered and are now willing to let the Air Force evaluate your recent unidentified flying object photo.

If you will forward the original negative, we will analyze it. If you have been using the type of film in your Polaroid camera which produced both a photo and a negative, a print and negative will be acceptable. The photo and/or negative will be returned to you.

In order to analyze the photos adequately we will need the following camera information:
(a) Type and make of camera.
(b) Type, focal length, and make of lens.
(c) Brand and type of film.
(d) Shutter speed used.
(e) Lens opening used, that is "f" stop.
(f) Filters used.
(g) Was tripod or solid stand used.
(h) Lighting used.
(i) Exact direction camera was pointing with relation to true North, and its angle with respect to the ground.

The image contains a PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT for an UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT observed in MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA on 20 OCTOBER 1966. The report states that the photography appears genuine and that the submitted print has negatives indicating "fast-shutter" shots. The object is described as a small, bright, clear, and slightly oblong object with a scaling factor that made it appear larger than normal. The report concludes that the unidentified object is possibly a result of an attempt at photography through a window or windshield which distorted the object's appearance.

The text in the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 67-25
PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES
DATE OF REPORT 12 APRIL 1967
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA
PHOTOGRAPHY DATE 20 OCTOBER 1966
PNRS 1 Print (B & W)
QUALITY Fair
1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 67-37 submitted by Major Quinttella (ODSS) to determine if the single photograph submitted is genuine.
2. ANALYSIS: The photography appears genuine insofar as content is concerned. No discrepancies examination could be made of the submitted object. Examination of the submitted print has negated "retouching." Attempts to make a double exposure could not be detected. The object is noted in the image and was not placed there photographically. A small black dot appears on the frame border indicating that a camera was processing film. It is impossible to determine whether the print was enlarged or not. The object was unknown and a scaling factor to size the object was precluded. The object appears to be small, bright, clear, and slightly oblong.
3. CONCLUSION: As a result of the analysis, it can be stated that the unidentified object is possibly a result of an attempt at photography through a window or windshield, which distorted the object's appearance. A small degree of highlighting of the top center of the object. The unidentified object is possibly a result of an attempt at photography through a window or windshield which distorted the object's appearance as outlined above.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a letter responding to a sighting report and subsequent photograph taken by the brother or an unidentified person. The letter discusses the examination of the submitted photograph, noting that it is impossible to determine whether the object was a result of a photographic process or a real object. The letter also mentions that the only probable explanation is that the object is a result of photographic processing, with the reflection of a light source being a potential cause. The letter is signed by Lt. Colonel Barrett B. Young from the Office of Information of the Civil Branch, Community Relations Division.

SAFOICC/Maj Rademacher/jad/79079/12 Jun 67
JUN 12 1967

Dear Mr. __,
Reference your recent correspondence concerning a sighting and subsequent photograph taken by your brother or an unidentified person (UFO).

The examination of the submitted photograph negated reconnalssance. The photograph stated that the object was photographed with a Polaroid camera, yet two small black dots appear on the frame border indicating that the original was a negative process. This was a result of it being impossible to determine whether the photograph was made from an original negative or whether the object was a real phenomenon. As a result, it is impossible to determine whether the photograph was made from an original negative or whether the object seen in it was something real. The fact that the object is a result of photo processing rather than an actual visual sighting precludes any attempt to size the object or determine its distance. The only probable explanation is that the object is a result of photographic processing, such as the reflection of a light source, and recording the reflection of a light source.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

BARRETT B. YOUNG
