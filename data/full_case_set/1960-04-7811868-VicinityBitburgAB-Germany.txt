No Case (Information Only)
1 April 1960
Raleigh, North Carolina

(The text of the document is as follows:)

On the night of 1 April 1960 at approximately 9:45 PM the writer received a telephone call from a Mr. XXXXX who reside at XXXXX in Raleigh, North Carolina. Mr. XXXXX stated that approximately 30 minutes prior to his call he had observed a bright red light in the sky which was moving rapidly from west to east. He described the light as being quite bright and larger than a star. The light was observed for about 2 or 3 minutes before it disappeared from view. 

Mr. XXXXX stated that the light did not appear to be a conventional aircraft and he was unable to identify what it might have been. He was quite concerned and excited about the observation and wanted to report it.

The writer thanked Mr. XXXXX for his report and advised him that the information would be forwarded to the proper authorities. No further action was taken on this report.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text describing a UFO sighting that occurred near Wallops Island, Virginia on April 1, 1960. The text provides a detailed account of the event, including the appearance of a bright yellow streak of fire, a large reddish-sphere, and the subsequent disappearance of the object. The text also mentions the involvement of newspapers, universities, and observatories in investigating the incident.

The Wallops Island UFO

Perhaps the most spectacular (and short-lived) UFO in history appeared at 6:53 P.M. E.S.T. on April 1, 1960, along the east coast. A bright yellow streak of fire shot up from the horizon into the eastern sky and then changed into a huge zigzag pattern. With the streak of fire appeared a large reddish-sphere, reported by some observers to be as large as the full moon and seemingly close to the horizon. For a brief moment, the giant brilliant object slowly moved eastward, followed by a trail of greenish sparks. While still at high altitude and over the Atlantic Ocean, it suddenly vanished--as though it had simply taken off into outer space. Switchboards in eastern cities were jammed as witnesses called newspapers, universities, and nearby observatories to report a "fiery object in the sky."

Food's Day apparition: a scheduled but unannounced rocket launching from Wallops Island, Virginia. The yellow fire was debris from the rocket, reflecting the rays of the setting sun, contrary winds in the upper atmosphere produced the zigzag form. The luminous globe was a full-scale model of the Echo satellite--an inflated balloon seventy-foot in diameter. Carried aloft by the rocket, dry powder escaping through holes in the balloon produced the greenish tail. The object had "vanished" when the balloon full back into the atmosphere.

Although the newspapers published a full explanation within a day or two, some saucer enthusiasts continued to treat the apparition as a mystery. In its Special Bulletin for May the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (see Chapter XII) included the incident under "Recent UFO Sightings" and described the object seen as "bright, pulsating UFO that hovered in one spot for several minutes before it began to move." Not until three months after the launching did the organization conclude (UFO Investigator, July-August, 1960) that the April 1st UFO was "probably" the giant balloon sent up from Wallops Island. On August 12, 1960, the counterpart of this balloon went into orbit and became the satellite Echo, which is still circling the earth, shining like a star the first magnitude or second.

Mozambique, East Africa

On April 7 at Mozambique, East Africa a round orange object, which emitted a glow landed and four little men emerged and ran into the woods when their craft ascended. Prior to the landing of the object, it made a loud whistling sound. The witnesses numbered in the hundreds, however no additional report has come as to the fate of the little men."

NO CASE (Information Only) 
13 April 1960 
Lexington, Massachusetts

On April 13 at Lexington, a noted Boston area meteorologist, along with his wife and family, watched a bright white UFO swoop across the sky at 8:10 P.M. The UFO moved from west to east, then made a gradual turn to the north over the eastern horizon. Sturak checked with observatories and ruled out the possibility of a satellite before reporting the sighting. Meanwhile, the Fort Monmouth, N.J. radar had tracked a UFO at about the same time - apparently the same object.
