Sirs:

Last night at about 7:25 P.M., I was looking out of the picture window when I noticed a light which at first appeared to be a plane or helicopter, but as it came closer, I could see that it was a strange object about 60-70 feet in diameter which hovered for a few minutes and then took off at a terriffic [sic] rate of speed.

Yours truly,
