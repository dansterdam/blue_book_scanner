The shared image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, with text describing an unidentified object found on the side of a highway in New Jersey. The text provides details about the object, including its size, composition, and the circumstances of its discovery.

Newark, New Jersey

The text describes an object found on the side of a highway in New Jersey, which was described as resembling a partially hit car or truck. The object was approximately 12 feet long and 6 feet wide, and was composed of a material that contained copper and nickel, which is not ordinarily found in meteorites. The text states that the object was examined by the Museum of Natural History, but was not identified as a known object.

The image does not appear to contain a photograph, but rather a detailed written description of an alleged close sighting of an unidentified object by a couple driving on the Jersey Shore on February 6, 1956.

The text in the document is as follows:

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
6 February 1956
Somers Point, New Jersey

CLOSE SIGHTING MADE BY A COUPLE DRIVING ON JERSEY SHORE: A couple that we interviewed in the course of the evening said they observed an object which they could not identify. They said that they were driving along the Jersey shore when they noticed a bright light in the sky which seemed to be moving toward them. They pulled their car off the road and watched the object as it came nearer. The woman said that at one time the object was so close above them that it appeared good sized - about the size of a house. She said that it seemed to be shaped "like a kidney bean" and sometimes it appeared still, and then would move at a rapid rate of speed. When speeding, it would seem to change shape and there would be a bright light in the center, and a glow around the edge. At other times, the light would seem to be only a bright light in the center and a glow around it. There would be a bright light in the center and a glow below it - like a glowing tail. Finally, as the object seemed to be moving away from them, it suddenly disappeared. The woman said they would stand still a while, and then suddenly it would reappear.

UFO NEWS
(Reports should be considered as possibly additional to any reports as possible. Thank you.)
The following object was observed in the vicinity of South Newton, Iowa on the night of 7 February 1956. A witness described a fast moving object which flew and maneuvered in the sky for about one minute. The object was described as larger than a star, and as bright as a landing light on an aircraft. It was observed moving rapidly and silently. The witness stated that the object did not blink, nor did it leave any trail. The object was also observed by two other witnesses, who made nearly identical reports. All three witnesses are considered to be reliable.

The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a low-flying jet aircraft enveloped in an aura of cloud made by the jet itself. The text below the image provides a detailed description of the "condensation phenomenon" observed, including how the air cools by expansion in the slow-moving boundary layer, the depth of the boundary layer, and the interaction with the low-pressure system. The text also mentions that the image was taken on February 4, 1956, along the coast of Africa near Accra on a morning when the condensation phenomenon occurred several times during the maneuvers.

Aeronautical Chart & Information Photo Library 
number B-163969 A.C.
original source of photo unknown (photo taken during air show--)

A low-flying jet, enveloped in an aura of cloud made by the jet itself, can look like a strange object. This condensation phenomenon, called contrails, occurs when areas of low pressure develop on the wing surface; the air cools by expansion in the slowly moving boundary layer in contact with the wing. The depth of the boundary layer and the air pressure depend on the relative speed of the air with the aerodynamic qualities of the wing. An excellent photograph of one such disk produced by a Canberra jet was taken on February 4, 1956, along the coast of Africa near Accra on a morning when the condensation phenomenon occurred several times during the maneuvers. The weather was fine; the air patches of haze over the sea, and visibility was more than eight miles. During the display the air speed of the jet was usually too low or the air too dry for the aura to form. But over the cliff edge where the sea-breeze was just beginning to break through in patches the air would be moist enough to allow the condensation to persist. The effect is increased by higher speeds at the end of a dive (when the angle of incidence of the aerofoil is least) - but it is likely that the patchy onset of the sea-breeze was the most important contributing factor.

The image appears to show a group of people standing and looking up at a bright, triangular or wedge-shaped object in the sky. The object appears to be a UFO or some kind of unidentified aerial phenomenon based on the context provided.

SOUTH NEWTON, IOWA
Report No. 7340665
7 February 1956
Brighter than Stars, Silent Maneuvering in Sky Observed
Summary:
On 7 February 1956, about 1:30 p.m. CST, several persons in South Newton, Iowa, observed a bright, triangular-shaped object maneuvering silently in the sky. The object appeared larger and brighter than the stars. It moved slowly to the east and disappeared from view in approximately 10 minutes.
