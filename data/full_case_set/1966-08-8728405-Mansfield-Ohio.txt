Investigation Report
Sightings of August 16, 1966

This case began as a TWX from Truax Field to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, concerning sightings by three independent observers of a "moon-like" object. Before investigation of this sighting could take place, a reply to a letter concerning a previous sighting brought a clipping concerning sightings in the Mansfield, Ohio, area on the same date, August 16th.

From the clipping several leads were obtained.

Several calls to the White Cloud Field at Minneapolis resulted in contacting a salesman for the Aviation Company at the field; his report is enclosed. In his report were mentioned radio reports to Rochester TSS.

Other flying services were contacted at Flying Cloud:
Flying Service gave the name of ******* as a witness; he proved to have been a passenger. A man at **** Aviation said he was on the field until 10:00 PM and in a position to see anything that happened, but saw nothing. Tower personnel reported that the tower closed at 10:00 PM, so they were not present during the sightings. A rumor that an object settled on the runway and then take off has not been verified.

A call to Twin Cities International Airport yielded a report of ******** having seen an object; the name of his watch supervisor was obtained.

The St. Paul Pioneer Press/Dispatch, origin of the clipping, could not provide any additional information; the reporter was not known.

Aero Division provided the name of ********.

a flight instructor, as having been a witness, but she denied having seen anything.
A Mr. Earl Friedline of Rochester Airport control tower was contacted; he recalled hearing traffic with a Cherokee and a Cessna 310, talking with the Rochester Flight Service Station (RSS).
The RSS at Rochester was contacted, and a conversation with its chief, Mr. ***, ensued --see report. The registrations of three of the four airplanes reporting were obtained, one being too recent for the published list. The name of the duty man at the time of sightings, Donald Holmes, 612-33-3899, was obtained.
Donald Holmes recalled the traffic, saying all reports were obtained within half an hour (the logged times were 0430 and 0330). He reported one observer on the ground, but the name was unavailable.
The three aircraft were then traced down and the names of the pilots were obtained: ***, ***, and ***. The fourth airplane, by elimination, was that of ***, who is in the army, and a letter has been sent to him requesting a report.
The Fan Claire FSS was contacted; they will call collect if an examination of the log and conversation with personnel reveal any new reports. The registration and correct number of the Muske
teer reported in the Texas 7FX (given as *** and the pilot, Mr. ***) was contacted for a report.
Mr. ***, mentioned in the same TWX, was then contacted for a telephone interview; he had already sent a Form 164 in to the USAF.

Chicago Center Control at Joliet was then contacted, and a Mr. Bolasco examined the logs; there was no record or recollection of any unusual requests for radar coverage on August 26th. This is tempered by the fact that tapes are kept only 15 days and then are re-used; this investigation was done on September 8.

The Milwaukee FSS had no records or recollection of the incident, but referred the investigator to Milwaukee Approach Control; the watch supervisor, Mr. Phil Stepanski (414-747-8720) was contacted, and from him were obtained the names of the two controllers on duty at the time of the sighting. Mr. Stepanski requested that the phone calls be delayed until he could get in touch with the controllers himself to authorize them to talk with this investigator.

Mr. Carl Dodge and Mr. James Sidden, the controllers, were contacted; neither one of them had any recollection of anything unusual; both pointed out somewhat at length that they could not identify targets; as one put it, they can't tell a paper cup from a C-47. They made further that whenever they observe anything unusual, such as a fast object, they report it to Chicago Center Control, and they made no such report.

To find out how Mr. Howe, reporting officer on the TWX from TRAC, got the radar information about Chicago Center Control, he was called, but an alert was on and he could not be contacted that day.

Mr. Bishop was then called to verify the report from the Twin Cities International Airport; he verified it, and added that there was a separate observation phoned in later which caused them to reconsider the sighting. They then realized that it could not have been the moon, because of the time of day and the direction of the object.

there was no moon and because the windows are designed precisely to prevent such reflections.

Radio station WCCO in Minneapolis was then contacted in order to obtain ground-based sightings; the attempt being to find anyone who saw the object at a high angle. Advice was to call back Sunday.

The sightings so far obtained were then roughly plotted, and the most reliable lines of sight (from the Twin Cities control tower) and from we took a magnetic bearing) were found to intersect just north of Duluth, perhaps 100 miles. Therefore attempts were made to contact witnesses in Duluth.

Radio station KDAL was uncooperative, but WCCO (Channel 6) offered to send films of interviews with witnesses from the night of the 15th; the offer was accepted. The Duluth Herald looked up stories, and found several the name of was thus obtained, and a report was obtained from his sister, who was also a witness. 

It was then decided to try to obtain sightings from farther to the West, in order to pin down the area more closely. Calls were made to papers, police, and airports (and FSS) at Hibbing, Grand Rapids, International Falls, and finally Bemidji at Bemidji a lead was obtained to the effect that River Falls police, who had had some traffic on radio that night about UFO's.

The Thief River Falls police did recall some talk, but had nothing "officially logged" someone, however, recalled some "deal they set off at Winnipeg" that night, which, to their recollection, was an attempt to produce a man-made aurora borealis.

The text in the document reads as follows:

The Winnipeg papers were called, but this being Saturday afternoon, and neither paper putting out a Sunday edition, no information was available.

Mr. Hove was contacted on Sunday; he got his radar information from the witness.

The Winnipeg Tribune found the story about an attempt to generate a man-made aurora; the test took place in northern Ontario on July 20th.

No subsequent reports of rocket tests were found.

Through the Roseau, Minnesota Times-Region, contact was made with _______ who together with another couple saw a phenomenon having the same description as the others, but their time-estimates are somewhat off. The line of sight is fairly well established, and indicates that the event was farther north than thought up to this point.

At this time enough leads had been accumulated to attempt to locate the position of the object. When appropriate times of sight were drawn on a map, the sightings being used in which there appeared to be at least some reliability to the estimate of direction, it became apparent that the object had been far to the north of the U.S.-Canada border. Furthermore, from the fact that the object had been seen low in the sky by _______ who was flying at 5000 feet, it was apparent that the object must have been at least 500 miles above the ground, in order to be seen over the horizon.

The lines of sight had a great deal of scatter, so it was decided to request (on behalf of Dearborn Observatory) reports from other witnesses. Half a dozen newspapers were contacted and requested to run an announcement.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).

The text on the page describes the investigation of a reported sighting of an unusual event on the night of August 16th. The report mentions that the announcement brought in around 20 letters, most of which were related directly to the sighting. The letters and telephone interviews provided considerable insight into the way in which random witnesses reported very unusual events that they had never seen before. The performance is described as credible, and the results seem to show that if enough reports can be obtained, it may be possible to sift out of all the varying descriptions a good picture of the appearance of what was seen. The text also discusses how witnesses' interpretations of what they saw can vary greatly, and how this can affect the apparent characteristics of the observed phenomenon.

Sighting by August 26, 1966, Rochester, Minnesota
Witness: Supply Salesman, SHAKOPEE, MINNESOTA. Also, passenger riding with him, not interviewed.
The report: ___ was piloting a Cessna 172 at an altitude of 3000 Feet, headed north, about 10 miles due west of Rochester, Minnesota, on the night of August 26, at 10:55 PM CDT. Course was about 330°. He and his passenger noticed a luminous ball of light about 15° to the right of the course, and slightly higher in apparent altitude. The object was the "color of a fluorescent light". It appeared to be standing still or approaching; the airplane rapidly drew nearer and the apparent size of the object became larger and larger, until the passenger remarked, "I don't think I want to fly through that thing". At this point the object was seen by the pilot through the right half of the windshield, at the same altitude as the airplane, appearing to be about 3/4 of the window. Its outlines were not completely distinct.
The pilot put the airplane into a sharp turn to the west to avoid hitting the object, whereupon the object began to move with the airplane, pacing it for two minutes; airspeed, 115 mph, indicated. The object then changed course and shot off to the northeast. After a few seconds, the pilot decided to try to chase it, and turned to follow it. Think to illuminate it, he switched on his landing lights, but the object could then no longer be seen, and was not seen again. The object appeared to be travelling away faster than the speed of the airplane; the airplane following it.
While pacing the airplane, the object was farther away than at its closest approach; it was slightly higher than the airplane, so that to see

The text on the page reads:

It cut the right-hand window, the pilot had to lift the right wing slightly. The size of the object then appeared to be about the same as the chord of the wing at its tip (3 - 4 feet at that distance). At the closest approach, which the pilot estimates to have been one city block, the object was considerably larger in angular diameter.

The pilot then called Roschester Airport and reported the object, asking if any other pilots had reported anything; none had. Five minutes later, however, the pilot heard reports from two other aircraft, one a Cherokee, reporting a similar appearing object.

The Report: Mr. (redacted) was the passenger with (see report). 
The position given was 10 miles north of Austin, Minnesota. The object was seen to converge with the airplane, which was heading North, and which turned to a WNW heading. The object which had initially been at the 2 o'clock position was now at the 4 o'clock position (to the right). It was doughnut-shaped, darker in the center. The object then apparently receded, becoming smaller in angular diameter and losing the doughnut appearance for a solid appearance. Time of report reclined as "14:10" amended to 14:10 (2:40). Thought that report was made to La Crosse FSS.

The text of the document is as follows:

Sighting by 
August 16, 1966
Rochester, Minn.

Witnesses: Commercial Pilots, Corporation, St. Paul, Minnesota Home address: St. Paul Park, Minnesota

The report: was flying from Chicago to Rochester and to Minneapolis, with four passengers; two businessmen and two technicians found for work at IBM. As they will forward report forms. The airplane was a Twin Bonanzo, * * * * *. 

The plane had just turned at Waukegan, having intercepted the 330degree radial from the Rochester omni. After no more than 5 minutes of flight, spotted ahead and to the right a distant glowing ball, "locking like a golf-ball", at about its altitude (6,000 feet). In about 5 seconds it came rapidly toward the airplane, so fact there was no time to evade though it would collide he could take no evasive action. The object, however, passed to the right, and stopped relative to the airplane; that it's stops and accelerated is immediately began passing the airplane, now off its right wing. The airplane was cruising at 230 mph.

The pilot had exclaimed and called the attention of the passengers to the object as it approached; all four saw it, and all were at a loss to identify it. The object kept pace with the airplane at close range, appearing many times the diameter which the moon would have had. It was a pale green color, had an indistinct edge, was almost white, and perhaps somewhat brighter than the full moon. The pilot called in to the Rochester Flight Service Station and reported the object just before he came in for a landing.

The plane arrived at Rechester, and at that point the object veered off and departed toward the NE at a high rate of speed; the airplane continued in a straight-in approach, arrival having been at 11:15 A.M. on the 10th.

[redacted] noted that as the object veered off, it changed shape into an oval, the long axis being vertical; at this point there was a bright glow running vertically, with an oval mist or vapor around it. The impression was that he had been watching a flattened disc-shaped object, and saw it turn away like a swell rolling around a curve.  

The night was perfectly clear; [redacted] first thought was that he was seeing a cellometer beam, but then he realized that there were no clouds at all.

Sighting date: August 16, 1966
Witness: Commercial pilot, Aviation, Inc., Washington, Pennsylvania
Home phone:

The report states that the pilots were flying a twin Beechcraft southward. The location was 223 miles southwest of Rochester. The pilots had been watching the reports of other airplanes in the vicinity, and after several reports had come in, they looked around and saw in the distance a "very large" fuzzy ball or light. They could not determine any details. The object was climbing to 2500 feet, and they thought it was at the same altitude or lower. It was seen back and to the left from their airplane, or just about due north. It seemed to be about 30 miles distant. They reported their observation to the Flight Service Station in Rochester, but the station said he could not see the object well enough to give a description of its appearance, since it was too far away.

Sighting Report
August 15, 1966
Mr. and Mrs. Bishop
Minneapolis International Airport control tower

In the log-book of the control tower there is an entry at 0330 UP (2230, August 15), noting that a Mr. Brew, a controller, observed a UFO to the NE of the tower. Mr. Brew thought that the object was a reflection of the moon, and paid no attention to it, according to his watch supervisor Mr. Bishop; shortly thereafter a phone call from White Bear Lake (15 or 20 miles from St. Paul) from an unknown person called attention to a similar observation in the same direction, but by that time there was nothing visible. 

Mr. Bishop's number is 612-681-7539.

The text of the document is as follows:

Sighting by: August 13, 1966

Witness: Air Tran manager of Flying Service, Kent County Airport, Grand Rapids, Michigan, telephone [redacted]

The Report: The witness was flying to Madison from Grand Rapids, and had just finished a radar-controlled approach to Milwaukee when he first saw the object to the north of his course west, and the object was at 3 o'clock relative to his heading. [Redacted] describes it at that time as consisting of concentric rings, clear and sharply outside white, next bright fluorescent green, then 5 o'clock on the object was a gray wedge, like a slice of pie.

[Redacted] then contacted radar control again and asked to be picked up; making identification burn, radar approach control at Milwaukee said they had him. He then asked if there was any other traffic in the area, and the answer was affirmative: something was 25 miles north, and appeared to be approaching the object. The witness watched the object become larger, and was informed that the object was now 6 miles away and had turned to fly parallel with him. At this time the apparent size of the object was equal to one foot at one mile. He says that if 12 were in fact six miles away as the radar controller reported, it must have been "forty stories high". 

During the next 10 to 12 minutes the object kept due north of the airplane travelling parallel with it, at 135 miles per hour. It gradually developed indistinct edges and became fuzzy all over. Radar tracked it all the way to Madison. [Redacted] prepared for his approach.

(from the West, after a pattern turn) the object began to change shape; first it became egg-shaped (long axis vertical), then like a column of smoke, with the base at slight altitude, then becoming sharpened shape with the angle pointed east. It then faded out. This report has been given to Truax Field, and Mr. [ ] has filled out a form and sent it in. Landed at 12:45.

There does not appear to be any photograph or image in this document. The document consists only of text, which appears to be a report describing a sighting of an unidentified flying object near Waukesha, Wisconsin on August 3, 1966.

Report of Sighting
August 3, 1966
Waukesha, Wisconsin

Witness: Mr. Telephons, Brookfield, Wisconsin 53005
Pilot, back seat, two boys in back seat.

The Report: Mr. Telephons was flying back to Waukesha from St. Louis on a straight-in course, 5000 feet heading 5500 ft. altitude. At 1035 the object was first seen as similar to the full moon. Boys in back exclaimed "Hey, what's that?" Mr. Telephons asked them to turn off flashlight he was reading map with, thinking it was a reflection. Object did not disappear. The apparent size of the object was that of a silver dollar projected onto the windshield; witness was aware at the time of need for such a measurement. His recollection is that it would have been the size of the full moon.

The pilot then turned the airplane directly toward the object to obtain a bearing, which was 350° magnetic. He also took a reading on the omni from a nearby station and determined that his own position was 20 miles from Waukesha on the line from St. Louis to Waukesha. He then turned back to his course.

The object became larger, comparable to a saucer on the windshield, and at the same time appeared to become more tenuous. The pilot reported this to the Milwaukee Flight Service Station. The object then changed to a vertical shape and disappeared by fading away. The pilot guesses that it was 35 miles distant. He did not get the impression that it was approaching him. It seemed to be at the same altitude as the airplane.

Sighting of August 16, 1966
Location: Duluth, Minnesota

Witnesses: (a brother) and two nieces from California. 

The Report: The four witnesses were driving back to the suburban location of their home, on Lakewood Road, which is oriented directly north and south. As they were sitting in back of a 1964 Buick Electra, about 5 miles north of Duluth and 1-1/2 miles south of their house, the witness saw a hazy moon-like object in the sky; the others all saw it too. The witness says he was near the top of the windshield where the one who was sitting and watching, and slightly to the left of the road. Her brother stopped the car and turned off the headlights; they rolled up the windows, being apprehensive about what was going on. 

Then a spark, a star-like object, was emitted by the moon-like object, travelling horizontally to the right; directly ahead and in line with the road it began to expand and glow brighter. At first it was light bluish. It took on the form of a "perfect rectangle" for a few seconds, and continued to expand and get brighter until it became a large circular object "with rings inside the sky". The colors were blue to green. "Like shimmering" merging and changing; the entire array appeared to be rotating clockwise at first.

At this point all the witnesses became very apprehensive; put the car in reverse and backed up at high speed for several blocks, to the house of an acquaintance. All went indoors.

The witnesses called the police, and then called their parents.

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing a sighting of unidentified objects near Roseau, Minnesota on August 17, 1956.

The text in the document is as follows:

Report of sighting of August 17, 1956: Roseau-Thief River Falls
Witness: Two other passengers [redacted], Roseau, Minnesota [redacted].

The Report: The [redacted] were driving back to Roseau from Thief River Falls, 50 miles to the southwest. They were just south of Holt (about 10 miles north of Thief River Falls on highway 32) when they saw a bright orange or red object appear in the sky slightly east of north. It expanded rapidly, at first having a dark hole in the center and then appearing "all colors of the rainbow". This appearance gave way to a silvery cloudlike appearance. About 10 miles further north, the second object appeared, and [redacted] called the attention of the others to it. The second object appeared apparently directly above the remains of the first, and went through the same sequence of appearance. The clouds remained visible in the sky, apparently drifting slowly to the northwest, all the time while the rest of the trip was completed. At one point the clouds seemed to drift in front of the north star, which could be seen through the silvery cloud. The cloud also passed before a "bright star" in the northwest.

Time estimates are highly variable. [redacted] says that they arrived at Roseau at 10:42 CDT, which would place the initial sighting at about 15:43. [redacted] guesses that the initial sighting took place at 10:15 to 10:30. If [redacted] is off an hour, the initial sighting would agree with the others of this series provided the trip took around 50 minutes. According to the road map, the distance from Thief River Falls to Roseau is 60 miles by road, the road passing through 6 small towns starting with Holt.

Holt is 11 miles north of Thief River Falls. Sighting was seen coming out of the direction of about 12-15 degrees east of north --- to north than to northeast.
Reports that the cloud appeared to drift to the west as they drove, either because of the motion of the cloud, or both.
According to the editor of the Roseau Times-Region, many others saw the phenomena, and the best direction estimate according to him was 10 degrees east of north.

Attention: UFO Department

Dear Sirs:

A U.F.O. was just observed between 11:20 and 11:50 P.M. August 16, 1966 at my home. The U.F.O. was generally a brilliant yellow light moving rapidly from south-west to north-east. Movements were erratic. Occasionally it would stand still or hover, then dart off again with almost insignificance.

At first sight, I was sure it was not a satellite, as it would change directions and speeds, and at times stand still. I have observed satellites before, but this was not a satellite or a balloon. It was self-luminous.

Due to the wooded section where I live, we could only follow its path for a few degrees before it dropped behind the trees. Its speed and height would not take the necessary procedures to calculate its height. It hovered sometimes for a minute or more and I have been observing U.F.O.'s for more than ten years.

Those who observed it were: Myself, and my two daughters Mansfield, Ohio. It is my opinion that this was an U.F.O. I will appreciate an explanation of the latest two people and I would appreciate an explanation of the latest two people and I would appreciate an explanation of the U.F.O.

Objectively,
Dan R. Haber

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a report or document describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting that occurred on August 16, 1966 in the northern sky over North Central United States.

The text of the document is as follows:

NORTH CENTRAL UNITED STATES 
16 AUGUST 1966

At approximately 22:45 CDT, 16 August 1966 an "unidentified flying object" was observed in the northern sky. Four occupants of one car reported that after seeing an object that began to which change colors, heading toward their car, they turned the car in the opposite direction and drove away. The object appeared to rise up from behind the woods and after a pause began to ascend once more. Object was reported to vary in size from that of a full moon to that of a football field with blue, green, and faint red whirling lights turning to a definite blue-green as the object came closer. At one time, it appeared that a hazy green funnel went down from the object to the ground. As the object rose from the woods the brightness was compared to an early morning sun and gave off so much light it blinded the observer's eyes. It seemed that the object was coming toward the earth at a tremendous rate of speed.

The alleged UFO was also observed by a private pilot as he was approaching Madison, Wisconsin. To this observer, the object changed shapes from more shaped to oval and finally to an elongated "V" or boomerang shape. The pilot was flying at approximately 165 knots and the object was keeping pace with him. Other aircraft pilots reported similar sightings with very consistent descriptions.

Still other witnesses reported a green luminous object varying in size, that appeared to have exploded and faded in a haze. There was basically no movement of the alleged object as it slowly disappeared from view. In another instance the object dissolved into streaks of light before vanishing.

CONCLUSIONS

After considering the available information it was concluded that some type of unusual upper atmospheric phenomena had occurred. Contact was made with NASA in regards to any type of upper atmospheric research project that was currently underway at Fort Churchill in Manitoba, Canada.

It was learned that on 16 August 1966, German and American scientists were participating in several experiments over the Fort Churchill area. At 2239 GMT there was a rocket that departed the Fort Churchill launch area and reached an altitude of approximately 250 miles. Shortly before reaching the altitude, there was a barium cloud release into the atmosphere. The artificial cloud first appeared with a brilliant red color followed by and ending with a greenish-blue.

Primary objective of the experiment was to obtain measurements of electric fields and wind motion in the upper atmosphere by photographing and tracking the movement of the ionized barium clouds. The phenomena was visible for several hours and for hundreds of miles depending on the altitude of the sighting.

It is Project Blue Book's conclusion, after a careful evaluation of the available data, that this barium cloud release was the cause of the sightings. As the cloud was expanding it would have definitely seemed as if it were approaching the observer at a tremendous rate of speed. Being about 600 miles to the north from the one aircraft sighting, it would have appeared to pass the aircraft as the pilot so stated; this is a natural feeling when something is quite distant and visible to the naked eye.
