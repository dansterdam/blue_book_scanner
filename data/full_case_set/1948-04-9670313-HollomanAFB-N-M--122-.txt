With 107 incidents thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four
which contain good evidence but have no current ready explanation.
Two incidents have only one witness the assumption that the evidence
could be resulting from sources. When psychological and physio-
logical observation into consideration, all of these incidents
are explained satisfactorily. Additional study by Panel Consultant
Lewis W. Alvarez, University of California, and Laboratory (see Appendix
G 8), 

(d) Total (real and psychological, but previously unreported)
122 Incidents considered)

There are sufficient psychological explanations for the thirty-
unexplained flying objects to provide plausible explanations for
reports not obtainable explainable. The detail in identifying
stimuli results chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance,
size.

All of the remaining 24 incidents are treated in detail in the
report; there no findings of good pattern in regard to speed or other 
types of object; or certain cloud or sun effect. The Panel indicates,
with these manifestations followed by airplane interception,
probably good not have been considered vermin or reported
seen no publicity.

VII. SUMMARY AND EVALUATION OF "TEN TWELVE REPORTS

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix F) exhibit
certain characteristics. Two of them by statements of the reporters
could not have been made. Air messages not read of e.e.'s; countless
reports (Function 47). Most were distributed without pattern
throughout the United States or from routes outside the U. S. No two
descriptions of "appearance" or performances were exactly alike. The un-
covered eight in occurred in all fours of day and years.

In the following sections of this report, each responding unex-
plained in considered separately. It is not the intent to give any
one chapter any undue, but each case has undesirable clearance,

1. Reference is made to Par 2, basic communication. Apparently a 
misunderstanding exists in that I did not personally see unidentified ob-
jects moving at an excessive rate of speed on a radar scope. Rather, 
Mr. P__________, of Watson Laboratories, very probably saw unidentified 
objects. However, Mr. _________ informed me that the objects seen were
not moving in an excessive speed, but were rather motionless at an altitude
somewhat in the vicinity of 220 miles. When these were seen on the Radar
scope of the CPS-4 (Model?0) the angle of view/elevation of the Radar antennae
was approximately 70 degrees from horizontal.

2. During the latter part of August, 1947, this organization was carry-
ing on several tests runs with a modified SCR-270 at this base. I had re-
leased a cosmic ray reflector and two balloons and was watching them in their
flight as they drifted to the southeast from this base. While watching the
balloons through a pair of ten power binoculars, a white object, appearing
to be round, came into my field of vision. I followed the object as far as
possible but lost it within seconds after picking it up. The object was
traveling at an unprecedentated rate of sped and appeared to be several
thousand feet over the top of the Sacramento mountain range, travelling in 
horizontal flight south to north.

3. There may been other times when manning the M-33 Optical tracker,
that I have seen round or flat-round objects that were unexplainable.

4. In view of Par 1, this endorsement, it is suggested that Mr. P________
_______ of the Radar Laboratory, AMC Watson Laboratories, Red Bank, New
Jersey be contacted.

Report of Trip to Holloman Air Force Base, 5 - 6 May 1948

1. The primary purpose of this trip was to interview Dr. ████, repre-
senting the Watson Laboratories, who was temporarily on loan to Holloman Air 
Force Base. Upon arrival, it was learned that Dr. ████ had returned to
the Watson Laboratories at Red Bank, N. J. A teletype sent from Holloman Air
Force Base stating that Dr. ████ would not be available for interview did
not reach Hq, AMC in sufficient time to postpone the visit. However, it was 
learned that Dr. ████ would be at Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, Ala.
on or about 11 May 1948 for an indefinite period of time.

2. A civilian, Mr. ████ who works in the same laboratory with
Dr. ████, had also seen the unidentified flying object while in the presence
of Dr. ████. Mr. ████ was interviewed with the following stated results:

     a. The object definitely was not a balloon.

     b. The object (appeared round and white) was at a great altitude and
moved at a high rate of speed.

     c. Mr. ████ regretted not to send in a detailed report through channels, to-
gether with the report of another civilian who also witnessed the phenomenon.

     d. It was also learned that a Lt Markley who works in the Radar Laboratory
at Holloman AF Base has, on several occasions in the past, witnessed on his
scope unidentified flying objects of high altitude, moving at very high 
speeds. Lt Markley stated that he had not submitted these observations in
form of a special report or was not available for interview; however, a request
for a detailed report of these observations was forwarded to the Commanding
Officer, Holloman Air Force Base.

3. Lt Colonel James O. Easton and Mr. Alfred C. Loedding proceeded to
Phoenix, Ariz, to interview Mr. ████ and follow up on the report
and photographs submitted by him some months ago. Although Mr. ████ is 
currently employed as a pianoplayer in a night club, his primary interest
is in a small but quite complete laboratory behind his home. According to 
his business card, this laboratory is called "Panoramic Research - Laboratory
for Discovery" and it is completely enclosed and apparently is quite inter-
ested and equipped to compete in affairs in the City's offer of cash for
successful antiaircraft experiments. Mr. ████ stated he was an aircraft recognition 
instructor during the last war, and that in his opinion, the object sighted
definitely was not a wind-blown object. It is reiterated that the object was
"not less than 2000 ft, wavy and that it was not much more than 2000 at many 
times". He had greatly underestimated its size, Mr. ████ pointed out there
he had stood when he took the picture of this flying object and indicated
the exact path of approach and departure of the object. He added that on
this occasion the object only made a humming noise audibly, it made a whistling
or jet noise, or trend across the static, trailing and red, and was promised 
to send in another more detailed report, incorporating this observation.

```
Incident No. 122 – 5 April 1948, Holloman Air Force Base, New
Mexico. 
Three balloon observers saw an object very high in the sky, moving 
faster than any known aircraft and possessing a rounded indistinct form, 
which disappeared suddenly. It was soon less than thirty seconds and 
was approximately at simulated 5 degree elevation. The observers could not 
also guess size they stated if the moon were the size of an orange the ob-
ject would approximate the size of a disc. 

AFC Opinion: No explanation. However, the above comparison of 
size is to be noted. A disc held at arms length would shield the moon 
from the eye even if the moon appeared several times larger than it 
does. To reduce the proportion then, this object must have appeared as 
an infinitesimal point. From trained observers, this is certainly a 
major discrepancy.

6. All agreed on the following: the object was very high, moved
faster than any known aircraft, possessed a rounded, indistinct form, and
disappeared suddenly rather than fading away in the distance. It was under
observation 1/2 minute or slightly less. It was definitely not a balloon
from its maneuvers of speed, judging from the violent maneuvers which were per-
formed at a high rate of speed.

vations because all three men are trained aeronauts both optical and

MEMO

SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

TO: Chief, Air Weather Service,
Andrews Air Force Base,
Washington 25, D. C.
ATTN: DCS

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investigation and interpretation of data relative to sightings of unidentified flying objects. Attached Incident Summaries 1 thru 172 from the files of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendations as to which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine synoptic ascents by the ALF Weather Service, the Navy Aerological Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on all lightning. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are conducted or sponsored by the Army, Navy or United States Air Force are checked by the Intelligence Department of this Command. These checks are usually made direct from the Project "SIGN" office, MCIAO-3. These checks are distinct from the check of synoptic balloon flights made by weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department of Commerce, (U. S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed incidents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This list does not eliminate the possibility that many of the remaining incidents are balloons.

SUBJECT: Analysis of Project "Grudge" Reported Incidents
TO: Commanding General
Air Material Command
Air Technical Service Command
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio
ATTN: MAJOR HOLDER

1. Reference is made to the letter from your Headquarters
under date of 22 November 1948, 6 December 1948 and file
Grudge #4 dated 15 April 1949, requesting that reported incidents
through 172 be analyzed to determine whether or not these objects have
been caused by balloons launched by these laboratories.

2. A listing has been compiled of all balloon launched by these
laboratories and the ascension's actual atmospheric reactions, etc.
from the first flight launching the M10 on 17 November 1947,
one of the balloons has been recorded as unreported and
categorized as follows: of cases reported that of amazingly one
through 22, none of the traffic was due to launching and or
and point of recovery did not correspond to place of grades
launch and suitable evaluations from the known flights not made as
to this place or reported launches sent to your office may taken into
appropriate evaluating these copies of the launching lists are supplied.

3. Analysis thus far of Project No. 194 reported on 15 July 1947
through the Object M10 launched from snowy in general, establishing
or clusters or group of objects, motion in trail, balloon launches
one M10 period was a cluster of balloons and was not recoverable.
a slight upswept bend of the course of these were reported
although not observed, this was was observed in the La Venta
Sacramento Valley area twelve northwest of Albuquerque, ones to
motion towards red light contained both by airplane operations and by
release time balloons was launched the theodolite instrument
of the balloons and evaluation was provided for by the
possibility of this traffic.

4. A Ghost mission No. 11 7 July 1947 could suggest
with response to type M10 models shot through by to, and one
with incident to No. This balloon flights was type a cylinder.

1st Ind., Hq 4th AF, Hamilton AFB, Calif., 9 NOV 1948, to CG, AMC, Subj: Analysis of P.

(Paragraphs 1 & 2 redacted from the AF LO to CG AMC.)

3. Your ltr with 1st Ind (here in) 3 Oct 48, received in this HQ on 5 Oct 48 refers to "objects observed in the vicinity of Muroc AFB and the vicinity of Mt. Rainier. The incident in the vicinity of Muroc did not occur on the date of your letter, 1 Jul 48, but it did occur on 8 JUl 48 (Exhibit A attached). The incident in the vicinity of Mt. Rainier did not occur on 4 Jul 48, but it did occur on 24 Jun 48 (Exhibit B attached) and was the sighted objects (5 each) were balloons launched by the AAF, Watson Laboratories Branch, Engineering Division, AMC, Dover, N.J.

4. On Exhibit "A", it should be noted that both the radar operator, T/Sgt Le Roy E. Dunn, verified the presence of the object in question on his radar scope and tracked it for a period of six minutes (two thousand to four thousand yards of range) without observing any abnormal operational characteristics or unusual behavior. Photographs could have been compiled on this object by the automatic aspect camera at Muroc AFB which is located at the CPS (AN/MPQ-2), but at the time of contact the camera was not in operation.

5. In Exhibit "A", the 3000 plus or minus 10% MPH does not seem to fit usual or reported performance of "flying saucers". A similar incident happened on the East Coast (ACNR Eastern Sea Frontier 4/15/48) with a speed of 10 to 20 MPH, where the "object" tracked in on a radar set was a balloon; hence the term "saucer" or "disc" does not present a conclusive "picture" of these incidents.

6. All other reports similar to Exhibit "A" which have been made by this headquarters to your headquarters can be attributed to test missiles or reasonable comparisons with balloons launched by Watson Laboratories.

7. The balloons used by Moore Laboratories are very consistent in performance; they are 20 foot white plastic, white in color, and ellipsoid-rectangular in shape, knotty tail and hanging ears which are the instruments they carry. They average 8 to 10 hours of controlled level flight, reaching altitudes up to 100,000 or more feet altitude. They are launched during regional static periods and other periods of varied wind forecasts. As is required their position at any interval which is sent to the intercepting airborne fighter or interception.

This Filem to Go AGMC Analytic Croup, Through Channels Time

If and when another flying object comment to the attention of this headquarters and should you desire to send it to AGMC for examination, it is urged that the following procedure be effected in the shipment of it:

a. Consult this headquarters as soon as possible following the recovery of such objects so that transportation can be arranged to ship same by the most expedient means.

b. If practicable, effect chemical analysis of the object prior to shipment to this headquarters if same will not destroy or too drastically alter the object in question, and forward these findings along with the object. If a sufficient quantity of the material is recovered to permit such a procedure. In this way the chemical analysis can be compared, analyzed, and a more accurate check made of same.

6. As has realized that is might not be possible for an observer who reports the sighting of supposed flying saucers, naturally, desire to have as objects of sighting, to be analysed definitely as to their nature. However, this headquarters does believe that a broad qualitative picture of what can be expected to be found can be evolved that will enable observers reporting such objects to reach a reasonable conclusion regarding their nature, if they should come possession of them. It is therefore desired that a general review be made of the previous United States investigations along this line and especially as to how they were analysed. This information can then be furnished observers who have this interest at heart. In dispersing this type of information it can be forwarded through the ACIC to various, civilian police, forest and fire wardens, and other persons who might not unlikely come into contact with flying objects. If any information concerning UFOS, this should be given to the public, instructions for releasing same can should be included.

7. This consideration will be planned to be of any further action required in connection with this matter.
