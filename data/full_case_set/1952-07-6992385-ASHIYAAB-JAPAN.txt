There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old Air Intelligence Information Report document related to a UFO sighting in Ashiyaab, Japan in 1952.

The text in the document is as follows:

AT APPROXIMATELY 21:29 ON 29 JULY 1952, UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED FROM ASHIYAAB AIR BASE, JAPAN. THE OBJECTS WERE FIRST OBSERVED APPROXIMATELY 30 MILES EAST OF ASHIYAAB. INITIAL OBSERVATION WAS OF A SINGLE BRIGHT LIGHT WHICH MOVED IN A CIRCULAR PATTERN AND GRADUALLY DROPPED IN ALTITUDE UNTIL IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 1500 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL.

AFTER REMAINING STATIONARY FOR A FEW MINUTES, THE LIGHT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND REACHED A SPEED ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 600 MILES PER HOUR. IT THEN REMAINED VISIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 2-3 MINUTES BEFORE DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE LIGHT INCREASED IN INTENSITY AND BRIGHTNESS CONSIDERABLY.

AFTER FAMILIAR OVERHEAD, THE LIGHT RETURNED TO THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF INITIAL OBSERVATION AND HOVERED AGAIN FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES. IT THEN ACCELERATED RAPIDLY AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. ALL MOVEMENTS AT THIS TIME WERE ESTIMATED TO BE AT SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 600 MILES PER HOUR.

INITIAL INFORMATION RECEIVED BY THE BASE WAS NOT COMPLETE, AND THE REPORT WAS NOT TURNED IN UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY. THERE WAS NO SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH ANY PORTION OF THIS OBSERVATION.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. CB 482
PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

7. I am aware of the location of the Yahata Steel Mills in the approximate area in which the light was observed. The greatest period of activity at the steel mills has been the last few days of each month when new steel orders are being received. This has been the result of any industrial activity in this area. The light was stationary and not capable of causing the rapid movement observed.

8. Based on the flight characteristics and the actions of the light, I must have been dealing with something that had many miles offshore due to the distance traveled by the light, which must have been of tremendous speed to be visible from the earth's surface by the change in angle to the line of sight. The light came from the north and apparently was in a straight line and was not erratic in motion. It was as if the nature of the light was broken and not a solid over-cast.

9. Interviews of witnesses confirms the sighting referred to in this report. The sighting as described by other persons within the Ashiya-Ashiya Air Base confirmed by persons with military personnel were very similar and differed only in details.

10. Weather during the time of sighting was scattered clouds 3,000 ft., ceiling 12,000 ft., visibility 10 miles, wind 5-8 M.P.H.

(APPROVED 1 JUNE 1949)
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

TRP CARR GP (M)
1352  Intelligence
1. On 27 July 1952 at 2305 hours M/ST, what appeared to be an object passed out the window of barracks 2-50 and at an angle of 45 degrees from the horizon. The object appeared on the horizon at 360 degrees at an angle of 75 degrees and descended to an angle of 45 degrees at which it was approximately 10,000 feet above the ground. The object appeared to be cone or cigar shaped and within 1 mile of the point of observation. The object then appeared to be coming from the Southeast and disappeared on the horizon. The object was observed for approximately 45 seconds.

Object: Blank looked like a large pale yellow cylinder (or white ellipsoid) it had rounded ends, windows or portholes lighted brilliantly on the inside were seen. Some color flashed along the horizon. Object seemed larger than it. The whole sight lasted approximately 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. The entire sight was just like shooting star, just a bit slower.
In saying the object made a low hovering curve, I was mistaken. In any event, this hovering of the object is considered to be constructing small light circles.

10 miles, wind 5 m. 5 knots.
