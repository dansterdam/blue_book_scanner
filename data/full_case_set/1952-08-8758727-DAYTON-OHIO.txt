Memorandum for Record
Subject: Report of Unidentified Aerial Object
1. A.L. approximately 1200 on 25 Aug '52, an individual from Vandalia called and said that on the night of 24 Aug '52 he was in the Sherwood Drive-In at Dayton. He noticed two objects which were about 15 times the size of a star floating thru the sky at a rather high rate of speed. They seemed to have a "weird glow," similar to a light-bulb placed behind a thin cloud. He said that he was facing north and that the objects came out of the southeast, first came into view at about 45° to his right (southwest). They came across the sky at an elevation of about 45° and when they got into the southeast they just disappeared as if someone had turned the light out. The incident took place between 10 and 11 P.M. Eastern Standard Time.
2. Mr. stated that although he was extremely dubious of any publicity on "flying saucers" these things did have the appearance of a saucer. He was very apologetic about calling and stated that he had been a person who had scoffed the most at those "flying saucer" reports and that he did not say that the objects he saw were "flying saucers". He stated, however, that they definitely gave the appearance of being disc-shaped and he did not believe that they were aircraft.

Report of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

Date: 31 Aug. 1952
Time: 2345 hrs.
Details: Capt. Atkinson, OP NO. 1, Bldg. 10, received a call from the Piqua Police Dept. (Patrolman Etter) at 2330. Patrolman Etter informed Capt. Atkinson that one of the inhabitants of North Piqua) observed an unidentified object with red and blue lights, definitely unlike an aircraft. Patrolman Etter stated that the object hovered and as soon as a squad car became available, he would check with Mr. Etter on this story. Ptl. Etter feels that the source is reliable. Mr. Etter phoned No. 1 in POLIA.

I advised Capt. Atkinson that we would like to speak with these people as soon as the return call is made. Since action is being taken, do not feel that there is any need for an immediate call.

REPORT OF "UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA"

At 20:25 a woman called to report the sighting of "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena". Advised her that while she did not have to identify herself, it would be helpful if she would do so, she gave her name as "Mrs. ___, Dayton".

She stated that at approximately 19:00 she heard her son, who was playing in the yard, call telling her to come look at something in the air. She went in the yard. Her brother-in-law also came out going something. At first she saw nothing, but then in the southeast she saw "disc shaped" objects. Objects were out in the open, moving slowly on a rather flat basis. After a brief period of time they disappeared over the trees.

As something over an hour had passed since observing objects, due to trying to decide whether to report them, then trying to find out how to report them her information was inexact, she had great difficulty trying to describe objects as to size, distance, and number.

It was still daylight at the time of sighting, yet they saw the objects. Asked if any familiar fixed objects were within her field of vision at the time which would give comparison, she could not specify any.

Feeling that further questioning on my part gave promise of little return, I terminated conversation. Then checked the phone book to see if anyone by the name of the woman was listed. I called the number listed and verified the fact that the woman at this residence had in fact been the person who called.
