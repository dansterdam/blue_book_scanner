NOVEMBER 3, 1966

Attention, Capt. Craig
605 Dimmick Circle, Apt. C
Westhampton, N.Y.

Dear Sir:

In accordance with our telephone conversation this morning I am sending you a copy that you may forward to your office. Since you feel there is a need for a report of what I have seen and with it a copy that you may forward to your office. 

I think there are a lot of level-headed, none who are seeing unbelievable sightings. If they show contempt of ridicule from the press and radio they may never tell the other hand there are possibly nervous or other who would the other hand there are possibly nervous or other who would the powers that they deserve.

As for myself, I have studied the stars and astronomy for many years to make a hobby of it. I was not in an hysterical frame of mind when I saw what I saw on the evening of September 28, 1966. I was startled and surprised but I believe what I saw.

If the powers concerned wish to take this as a serious case, I shall be glad to cooperate in any way that I can at such time as you may wish to contact me.

Since I am a retired person, I am more or less at your disposal at a moment's notice. I shall be glad to answer any questions with regard to my sighting that you may care to ask.

I believe the Air Force wishes to enter what evidence they can. Sincerely,

A Resume of What I Have Seen in the Sky over Westhampton
Oct 27, about 8:10 E.D.T. as we passed the Cocoa-cola plant on Riverhead Road, I saw a bright light in the west, appearing to be high in the sky. This light flashed on and off once and then disappeared.
Oct 28: 7:20 E.P.T. a brilliant light was in the west as I was outside my house on Westhampton. It flashed on and had a succession of red and green lights, distance or altitude from my house was a regular period of at least four or five minutes. Then as quickly as it appeared, it disappeared.
I saw the same thing several other nights, and one was on Friday, Oct. 21 at about the same time as the home from grocery shopping.
After I got home from shopping the eve of 28th, my 8o-year-old WAPC of Riverhead so we went the lonely Riverhead road to see if we saw any more lights. We did not see any additional bright lights, seemed to drop down from about half way from Speonk to Riverhead.
Oct 29, I saw the same light as on the previous nights, in the western sky. Also in the western sky I saw a tiny red flickering light, that traveled in a straight line from north and suddenly shot straight up. I had called the fire department, the police who came did not see the light.
At 8:15 I was outside as a guest had just left, and I saw the light pole in front of my house. (I expect the light to come on shortly). As I was watching, the light suddenly went out and a tiny red light appeared at the position it had been, this red light seemed to move up and down and back and forth. While I was in this position suddenly the light went out and a tiny red light seemed to shoot up into the sky.
Get 31, 9:15 P.M. The same brilliant, red, green and white light.
I used to be a plane spotter during World War II and airplanes, and certainly with their lights, since I live Suffolk Air Base, as well as driving workers to the same that have seen the unfamiliar lights in the sky, have never seen lights like these before.

The text in the document states:

"The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 200-2. Refer to you have any questions in the handling of this report. Turn in this with your OD report in the morning.

One final note. Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-in-the-sky" sightings. When a report comes in that is obviously based on more tangible evidence, or when several reports of sightings at the same time are received, contact the Operations Duty Officer through the CADC 493. Reports are much more easily investigated at the time of the than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will help Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner."
