There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be the text content of a science news letter from September 27, 1958, discussing the increasing brightness of Mars in the October evening sky and the upcoming total eclipse of the sun.

The text content is as follows:

MARS STILL BRIGHTENS
As Mars becomes brighter in the October evening sky, astronomers prepare to study the total eclipse of the sun on Oct. 12. 
By JAMES STOKLEY
STEADILY DRAWING closer to earth, the red planet Mars is becoming brighter and brighter in the evening sky. At a distance of 45,315,000 miles, it will be only 55,700,000 miles from earth on October 12, when it will be at its closest to our planet in this particular opposition.
This increase in brightness is only about 10% per month. As Mars grows nearer, its apparent diameter also increases. In April, when it was 248,000,000 miles away, it looked like a star-like point of light. Now, at 55,700,000 miles, it appears much larger, about the size of the moon's image, and it shines with a ruddy, fiery hue, in contrast to the pale, silvery light of the moon.
This increase in the planet's magnitude, or brightness, is called an "opposition effect." It occurs when a planet is directly opposite the sun in the sky, and therefore closest to the earth. Opposition of Mars occurs about every 26 months.
Even though Mars is some 55,700,000 miles away, this is the closest it has been to earth since 1956, when it approached to within about 35,000,000 miles. The next time Mars will be this close will be in 1960.
When Mars is at this relatively close distance, it appears much larger through a telescope than it does at other times. Most amateur astronomers, however, will not be able to see very much detail on its surface.
VENUS NEW BRIGHTEST
Brightest star of the October evenings, however, is Venus, in Libra. This is the "evening star," the most brilliant object in the sky after the sun and moon. At the present time, it outshines even Jupiter, the giant planet.
Venus has been shining very brightly in the morning sky, just before sunrise. At the present time, it is visible in the east-northeastern horizon about an hour ahead of the sun, and may be glimpsed if you have a clear view in that direction.
Later in the month, however, it will rise only a few minutes before sunrise, and will not be visible.
As the moon goes through its phases during October, it will reach the new phase on the 12th, when the total eclipse of the sun will be visible along a path through parts of South America and the South Atlantic.

Abstract our issue for CST. two hours to MST., and three for PST. September 27, 1958.

Study the Corona 
Although it is no longer necessary, as it was a few years ago, to wait for a total eclipse to observe the sun's outermost layers - the corona, this feature can only be seen and photographed in its greatest detail and extent at such a time. Many of the observaitons will be made in connection with the 11-year cycle of solar activity, which changes in step with the 11-year cycle of terrestrial weather, but observations will also be made to study the nature of the high disc we see ordinarily, just as the beginnings and end of a total eclipse. This will be done with the aid of spectrographic, photography and other means, and will yield many valuable data.

Of course, such observations require a clear sky, and the U.S. Weather Bureau has estimated that the chances of clear weather at college time are 60-70%, but such clouds as will be present are likely to be thin, allowing good viewing of the corona. Two packages of rockets that will be fired to high altitudes on Oct. 15 and 29 may also aid in studying the corona, as they will provide platforms for cameras and other instruments that can escape the obscuring effects of the lower atmosphere. Attempts will also be made to determine changes in the high atmosphere as it is momentarily in the shadow of the moon.

Big Fiery Object Seen
In Early Morning Sky

A "shooting star". It was reported to have been seen from Spokane, Washington early Friday and a weather observer at Long Beach, N.Y. said "It was so bright i could see fine print 20 minutes later". The object raced from Spokane Valley to the Palouse worxs at Han ford, WN. ED.

Deputy Sheriff William H. Miller of Spokane County said the object lit up the ground around the car in the Spokane Valley for from 12 to 20 seconds and the object cast shadows from nearby objects. Spokane city police said they also saw it. Other reports came in from Colfax.

Here is the text output from the document:

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

23 OCTOBER 1958
DISNEYLAND, CALIFORNIA: Almost an outstanding exhibit were undergoing secret midnight tests, a brightly glowing thing-shaped UFO was being flown directly over a Disneyland area near Garden Grove, California. last Oct. 23rd. It was seen by Richard Oesterlein, who spotted the object while driving home at 12:30 a.m. along a nearby street. He described the object as the size and shape of a blimp, surrounded by a halo glow, and with three or four brilliant pinpoint lights. The object itself, with a bright light shining at the end, was in view for about two minutes. Eyewitness Oesterlein stated the UFO was in view for an additional period toward the ground and disappeared in a bright flash, without making any noise.

On Friday night the 24th of 
Oct. there was similar performance in Stayton & Mill City, Oregon
Police Chiefs at Stayton 
Mill City See 'Sky Light'

Stayton Police Chief, Everette Norflett, Sgt. Ronald Prey and another Stayton officer were watching the sky while on a routine patrol at 7:30 PM while they were on a routine police patrol. 

It looked like a bright star moving across the sky. Norflett said, "It watched for flying saucers ever since they were mentioned and I never saw anything like this before."

The object was reported to have been a light "star" color gradually changing to a reddish color and emerging like a searchlight. It was watched for some time hovering over Mill City.

At the same time, Mill City Chief of Police, Clarence Meader, reported seeing an object moving East from where he was watching. Both of Mill City.

I am not saying what it was, Meader said, reporting that it was a clear bright blue point of light. The object was seen later in the evening from a point west of Mill City. This time it was moving West, Meader said.

Although there were jet planes reported in the area Friday night, both men said they were familiar with jets, and that the object was something else.
