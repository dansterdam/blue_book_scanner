The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon with an object above it, and the observer is asked to imagine the height of the object above the horizon. The second and third sketches depict a larger scene, with a person standing on a road and a silhouetted landscape in the background.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

There is no photograph or image in this document. It appears to be a typed text document containing a report or letter describing a sighting of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) on July 4, 1960 in Great Neck, Long Island, New York.

The text of the document is as follows:

July 5, 1960
Great Neck, L. I.

Dear Sir:

Last evening, July 4th at 8:15 P.M. my wife and I were visiting at Brookville, Nassau County, Long Island N. Y. We observed three distinct circular objects passing rapidly across the clear sky. It was in the view of 3 of us (1 neighbor) for approximately 1 1/2 minutes. They kept a constant formation and about 2/3 the way across the sky one of the three objects changed course, but the other two remained on their same course.

There was no wind on the ground, and they were going in a S.W. direction.

One said it was the color of the moon. I said it had a pearly, glistening reflection. It seemed bigger than the headlight of a car, but I would say they were very easily seen, but must have been far up. One said the edges were fuzzy; my wife, who has very sharp vision, said she got the impression of whirling rings around the object. I was told to write to you by the news editor of the N. Y. Times. I am 35, and was a disabled serviceman. My wife has a Masters in Education from Columbia. We would appreciate that we find out what's happening.

Great Neck, L.I.
regarding an observation of 3:15 P.M. on May 30, 1960. 
Three distinct objects passing in a southeasterly direction at a very great speed. Objects appeared to be about 150 ft in diameter and were traveling from east to west at an estimated speed of 1,500 to 2,000 mph. They kept a constant formation and disappeared from view in about 1 to 2 minutes.
The observations. The size and form of the three objects were round or circular in shape and kept in a constant formation as they passed. As the objects continued to move, their speed seemed to increase and they disappeared from view.
There was no sound of any kind and they were going in a very straight direction, seemingly very far in the distance.
One said it was mother of the moon. Didn't cloud a particularly photograph. It was impossible for me to get the binoculars, but I would say this were very unusual objects and not any known type of aircraft. On said the objects were traveling very swiftly, my eyes had hardly time to follow them, so fast they were moving.
