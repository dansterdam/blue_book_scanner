BRANCH: COMMENTS: THE OUTSTANDING FACTS INCLUDE:
(1) THAT THE PLANET-SATURN WAS AT A SIMILAR AND
APPROXIMATELY ELEVATION AND AZIMUTH AS WAS THE OBJECT
SIGHTED; (2) THAT AS THE OBSERVER CLAIMED, THE OBJECT
DID NOT MOVE NOR PERFORM TACTICS, AND TWINKLED LIKE A 
STAR, GIVING OFF A YELLOWISH GLOW; (3) IT IS WELL
KNOWN THAT SATURN IS NOTED FOR ITS SHINING YELLOWISH
LIGHT; (4) OBSERVER HEARD NO SOUND, NOR SAW A TAIL OR 
TRAIL, NOR OTHER PROTUBERANCES; (5) WHEN OBJECT WAS
RECHECKED, AFTER 1/2 HOUR, IT WAS NOT THEN VISIBLE; AS
PLANET HAD MOVED INTO ITS NORMAL STARRY SKY;
ADDITIONALLY IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT A CLEAR NIGHT-
WITH ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION CAPABILITIES WOULD MAKE
SATURN APPEAR LARGER AND IN GREATER MAGNITUDE THAN
NORMAL TO ANY OBSERVER- THUS THE FACTS IN ALL
PROBABILITY POINT TO THE OBJECT BEING THE PLANET
SATURN; L. EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE-NONE.
