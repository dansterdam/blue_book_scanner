Text from the document:

DALLAS 27, TEXAS
MARCH 16th, 1961

WADE SHATTVRRY, D.C.

DEAR SIR:

As recently as 12:07 AM CST early Tuesday morning, March 7th, I observed an unidentified object passing over the Dallas-Fort Worth area. I may have identified this object in time, but from about three seconds after first observing it, my view of the object was obstructed by some trees near my home, and the impression is left with me that I would never have been able to identify it from that standpoint.

The object appeared to be very high, at least 20,000 feet, and travelling at a moderate rate of speed, not fast enough to be a jet but considerably faster than any conventional aircraft.

I would like to report this observation, not because I think it has any special significance, but because I feel that I should report any unidentified objects I observe, in case they happen to be of interest to your organization. I am reasonably certain that the object I saw was not a conventional aircraft, but I would not speculate as to what it might have been.

Sincerely,
[Signature Redacted]

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? The handwritten response indicates "1 mile x 1/4 mile" in size, compared to a football field.

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or aren't's length in line with the object. How much of the object is covered by the width of the match? If you have performed this experiment, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? The handwritten response mentions "just about 1/2 size of wid" in relation to the object's size compared to the match.
