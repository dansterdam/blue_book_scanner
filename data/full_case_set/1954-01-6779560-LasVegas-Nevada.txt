3 States Report 
Flash in Sky
A very bright, luminously identified by astronomers as a meteor, flashed across the sky over wide areas of three states Saturday night, the Air Force said. Officials at Kirtland Air Force Base said they were informed the brilliant flash was seen as far east as Ohio and as far west as Nevada. 
The rush of light, lasting about 2 seconds, was reported by civilians and military personnel at various points.
The object, apparently a large meteor, was seen across the skies of Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming, the Air Force said.
