Mr. ____ had called the FAA Tower Personnel immediately after sighting the alleged UFO. Coordination with the local FAA personnel revealed nothing significant. They had not seen the alleged UFO. They had no knowledge of aircraft in the area at the time.
I believe Mr. _____ saw a meteor (see a.(9) above) or the rays of the sun may have created an illusion on the haze of the clouds at 20,000 feet (see para g. above).
