HEAD FOR RECORD:
At approximately 2330, he had a phone call from Major Wilson, SAFLL, Lt. Col. ORI/33, who stated that a reliable source had seen a UFO sighting the previous evening for over one of B&L officers, Congressman Schweiker, 13th District of Pennsylvania, related to their office.
(Called Wright-Patterson on it, but called Benton (AS), the nearest base to the Congressman's home district and nearest the sighting (Congressmart: Montgomery Co., Pa.). Benton had no report, but told Wright-Patterson (Area 517 -- K75-5912) could be glad to investigate if one of the 32 witnesses would be available to interview.)
At 1010, called Major Wilson, SAFLL, and gave him the above information.
He planned to relay it to the Congressman.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

August 21, 1968

Dear Hector:

Reference the August 2, 1968, letter to you from Mr. Pattori of POTTSTOWN (Pennsylvania) MERCURY (copy attached). What was the nature of the "unusual noise treatment" he received from McGUIRE AIR FORCE BASE?

Would appreciate a rundown as to whom he contacted, when, and what happened. If an official Air Force apology is called for, we will take action to have one made. We would first, however, have to have a few more details of what transpired before responding to Mr. Pattori's August 2 letter.

I have absolutely no proof, except to support this man's allegations, that he received "the mickey mouse treatment" from Melvin Marshall which we would indicate that this is a harsh treatment. However, he appears to be perturbed by the fact that the duty officer could not specifically identify the light to which he referred to. According to the AFRLO investigation, the duty officer did not have to identify the light, it appears that the duty officer failed to satisfy or to the reporter, and evidently this too, has perturbed him to some extent. I probably used the wrong word when I said "derelict" in an investigational manner, in not being able to satisfy an interrogative reporter when he was merely thinking about this at length. I'm not too sure that he deserves an apology. However, I think it appropriate that we respond in some appropriate way to what he really feels is unfair treatment - any suggestions?

Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office
U.S. Patterson AFB, Ohio

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

In reference to your request for more information concerning an unidentified flying object which I observed, I find that if my name in transmission from Benton Air Force Base to the project is changed, I might supply the persons address to whom I wrote and who might supply further information. 

My sighting, incidentally, was not reported to the Air Force for the purpose of investigation. I contacted the Air Force because various unidentified persons had contacted me about my alleged ability. My purpose in contacting him was not to make an official report, but to inform him that I did not believe that it was a conventional craft. I told him all the information that I previously observed. I told him all the information he might need about the persons I contacted and their crafts in different level zones. Private planes and higher and Air Force bombers, etc., at the same time in different zones did not seem unusual to me. 

Sec. 10 of a Mickey Mouse treatment. The Mercury received from the Aerial Phenomena Office a typewritten cover letter signed by Capt. Jesse Underwood. He enclosed a report written by Richard S. Schroeder who was in touch with Capt. Underwood at Benton and showed courtesy that even investigative ability. My purpose in contacting him was not to make an official report, but to inform him that I did not believe that it was a conventional craft. I told him all the information that I previously observed. I told him all the information he might need about the persons I contacted and their crafts in different level zones. Private planes and higher and Air Force bombers, etc., at the same time in different zones did not seem unusual to me.

POTTSTOWN MERCURY

(2)

I spent a good half hour explaining to Capt. Underwood the details of the craft I observed. 

In a nutshell, what I did observe was not a conventional aircraft. If weather balloons are lighted and have lights, this creature was not. It had a circular shape and yellow color and seemed to change directions. The wind at that time was blowing from the southwest, and the craft was traveling against the wind. However, I assume that it is a lower level craft as a higher level could probably be differed than that at a lower level. I also assume that the craft could have been hit by a sudden Thunderstorm which could have caused its erratic movements.

I would fill out your form if I thought for a minute that it would help. But I don't.

My own philosophy is against believe in UFOs as outlined in the enclosed column written by me. But recently I have had to conclude that there is something up there.

So many people have seen too many things too suddenly for me to accept a mass hysteria theory.

They can hardly explain themselves let alone explain what it is.

I appreciate the courtesy that Capt. Underwood showed me. He was the only representative of the Air Force who like what an Air Force officer should represent.

If I can be of any concrete help, please feel free to contact me.

STATEMENT

RE: UFO SIGHTING REPORTS DURING 1600 - 2300 SHIFT 28 JULY 1968.

On - Clear dry cool, visibility and unlimited vertically. Wind west to northwest 6 kts surface and 90 kts at 40,000 feet.

First UFO call from man in Trenton who saw a light between Trenton and Philadelphia, said it was moving slowly and erratically. ND change, radio sounds - satellite Echo Satellite because he had helped build it. Told him I had no idea what it was but would call around and thanks for the call. Time 2145L

NOTE: No report made as a light doesn't constitute a UFO - AFR 80-17.

ACTION: We're to WX and asked if north Philadelphia or Willow Grove put up WX balloons. Answer - didn't think so, called Philadelphia FSS and asked him to call Willow Grove to WX balloon. Answer: negative.

Second UFO call from man in Asbury Park - beach with friends, flew B-29 during war - thought it would never happen.

Q. What did you see?
A. Lights - one going north and one going south.
Q. What did you see behind the light?
A. Nothing.

Said I didn't know what it was but would report it and thanks for the call. Time 2215L

Third UFO call from man in Trenton who made first call. Light is now circling near the moon. Have you found out what it is yet? My answer negative but think I will go out and look myself.

ACTION: Told dispatcher I was going to roof, took binoculars, went to roof and looked skyward, scanned sky, saw about 30 planes, stars were twinkling brilliantly, various colors, climbed down. Time: 2300L

Every time I would look up, the light would disappear. The dispatcher said my concern was that Air Force Colonel next door had said she should complete a written UFO report of her light sighting. I assured her that her report was duly noted. Time: 2320L

Fifteen call - Noticed that the dispatcher completely cut off words on the telephone, I look over call, do not have name of caller. Caller said his boss wanted an answer for the light reported over Pottstown. I said I didn't have an answer - he told me he had many calls from New Jersey.

COMMENTS REGARDING:
I do not believe I ever spoke to Mr. ____ or his reporter, and a little too much to drink causing him to see things. I have never chided a UFO caller in any fashion.
I believe the gentleman is ranked because I could not identify the light and wasn't planning to report it.
COMMENTS ON CURRENT UFO REPORTING:
The Base Operations Duty Officer at McGuire Air Force Base is helpless to investigate and consequently identify a light over Pottstown, Penna. The person who should take a call and investigate a light is a man in Pottstown, located and appointed by the mayor of Pottstown, and equipped with an officer's badge, the local citizen of Pottstown could call the Pottstown Police who have a list of these UFO investigators. The police could then pass the phone number to the sighter who could then call direct to an appointed, equipped, and possibly trained local citizen who could meet with the sighter and possibly come up with an answer.
The current procedure of calling the nearest Air Force Base is expensive of time and money and useless as an investigative program.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing the theories and claims of Dr. Gerald Feinberg regarding flying saucers. The text describes various ideas and perspectives related to unidentified flying objects, including the notion that there could be an advanced extraterrestrial civilization capable of traveling to Earth. The passage also mentions that some physicists are working to prove the basic postulates of the UFO theory, and that this could be an exciting development in the world of science.

Text extracted from the document:

A Different Slant
By ISRAEL J. BOWEN

Dr. Gerald Feinberg
And Flying Saucers

The writer has gone from flying saucers to Dr. Gerald Feinberg, and maybe it is because most men of science don't seem to be interested in them, that this strange parallel has been made. But in any case, Dr. Feinberg has some interesting ideas about flying saucers.

According to the theory of relativity, it seems that faster-than-light travel is possible. Also, there is no evidence that it must conflict with the basic laws of physics, as some scientists have thought. Dr. Feinberg, who teaches physics at Columbia University, has suggested that an extraterrestrial civilization more advanced than ours could be visiting the earth in craft that travel at tremendous speeds.

About a year ago Dr. Feinberg appeared on a television program and discussed his ideas. He explained that such a civilization, if it exists, might be able to control gravity and use it for propulsion. This, he said, could be done by somehow tapping the energy of empty space.

Dr. Gerald Feinberg is taking about the first positive step by a scientist to indicate that the UFO phenomenon deserves serious study. While most of the theory of relativity says there is nothing to the flying saucer reports, Dr. Feinberg suggests that if the reports are valid, then they imply the existence of a technically advanced extraterrestrial civilization.

Dr. Feinberg points out that the universe is a vast place, and that there are untold numbers of galaxies. If there is intelligent life on even a small fraction of the planets in the universe, then the number of such civilizations could be very large. Some of these, he says, may have developed space travel capabilities far beyond ours.

While the theory of relativity says that faster-than-light travel is possible, it does not mean it can be done. But Dr. Feinberg suggests that a very advanced civilization might find a way to accomplish it. If they could, then visiting Earth would be comparatively easy for them.
