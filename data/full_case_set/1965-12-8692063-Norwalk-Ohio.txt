According to the document, the reported observation was of a light that appeared to be a car headlight, very bright white, which moved horizontally and vertically, then went off at a high rate of speed. The observer could not call it a car and the object was too far away to focus on it. The conclusion is that the observed light was an auto (Venus).

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
called 3 December 1955 at 1535 and informed the project office that a number of people in and around have seen a mysterious object in the sky at dusk and immediately thereafter. He claims that this object is emitting some sort of radiation. He also claims that the National Guard in that area took a Geiger Counter measurement and that it was positive. The National Guard is allegedly sending the information to the project office. I have requested that he send me all the information available so that we can evaluate the observation.

The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a dark, elongated object in the sky. The text below the image describes the object as an "unidentified flying object" that was observed on December 2, 1955 over the city of Norwalk, Ohio.

Text from the document:

It is said on the day of December 2, 1955, an unidentified object was seen in the sky over the City of Norwalk, Ohio about 8:15 pm. The object was observed for some fifteen to twenty minutes. The witness was Herman Waltenburger of the Ohop Road. He went to his car where eleven others were leaving for the night and told them of the object he had seen. The object hovered directly over the place where they were standing and then moved away to the northwest at a terrific rate of speed. The speed was so great that it left the observers breathless.

Official Report By
Norwalk, Ohio

On December 1, 1965, I saw a bright white light which would turn a blue-green color and would seem to go up and down faster than it turned a fiery red and disappeared. On several nights while watching TV, I would look out the front window and see a bright light like a searchlight being turned off and on, while I would watch for a week at approximately 10:30 to 11:30 p.m.

December 1, 1965
Norwalk, Ohio

On the evening of December 1, 1965, I viewed a bright light in the sky. It appeared to be about 10 times the size of a star and it seemed to be moving slowly. It was three times the size of my son and he took his telescope outside to get a better look at it. At one point, it moved at a rapid pace, then seemed to circle around and come back. The light was quite bright and the wind was blowing from the northeast.

It hovered in one spot for quite some time and then suddenly, it shot straight up and disappeared. It moved down over the trees and then shot straight up and out of sight. It did not make any sound that I could hear.

My daughter, who is 13 years old, and also witnessed the object. She said it turned blue when I was on the inside of the circle calling out to her. She has never seen anything like it before.

I got the feeling it was trying to communicate with me. I shouted, "What do you want from me?", but it seemed to just disappear. I got the feeling it might have been some kind of aircraft, but I have never seen anything like it before and I don't know what it was.

TRANSCRIPT:

Fremont, Ohio
Sheldon, 6/22

I understand the reason this action did not come to my
knowledge in the beginning was that the call came to my
home and I was away from the office. About 2:00 PM
June 22, 1965, I received a call from Mrs. Sheldon who
lives at 122 1/2 West Main Street, Norwalk, Ohio. Mrs.
Sheldon stated that she and her husband had observed a
strange object in the sky that morning about 11:00 AM.
Mrs. Sheldon was quite excited and said the object was
very close to their home and moved rapidly. She said
they had observed it for about 5 minutes and that it
finally disappeared. Mrs. Sheldon said she had called
the police department in Norwalk but that they had
not been able to locate the object. I advised Mrs.
Sheldon that I would notify the proper authorities.
I then called the Norwalk Police Department and
talked to the dispatcher and gave him the details
of Mrs. Sheldon's report. He stated that they
had received no other calls about the object.
