The only information available to this incident is a letter report from Minneapolis, Minnesota, dated 7 Oct., 1951, which states as follows:

"The only information available to this incident is a letter report, dated 7 Oct., 1951, which states as follows: 

"I don't know how to describe its size, because at the time I didn't have the binoculars to judge its size."

Shortly after this we saw another one, and this one didn't seem quite as large.

"When I saw the second, one I called our "reading" station at the airport and asked them if they had reported any unusual things in the sky. There were a number of other people, but couldn't keep the two visible long enough to get a good look at them. They seemed to fade out rather rapidly."

Status of Investigation:
Further details of the incident have not been procured. The sources have been investigated but no evidence that could be corroborated high altitude balloon projects.

MINNEAPOLIS, MINN. - 11 October 1951

I. LIST OF INCIDENT:

The only information available on this incident is a letter quoted below:

"THE 0650, 11 OCT 51. MY WIFE AND I WERE FLYING AT 10,000 FT. CARRYING A SMALL PORTABLE RADIO. AS I LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW TO THE NORTH, DIRECTLY OVER MINNEAPOLIS - ST. PAUL AIRPORT, I NOTICED A PECULIAR OBJECT IN THE SKY. IT APPEARED TO BE GLOWING BRIGHTLY AND WAS MOVING SILENTLY NORTH-SOUTH. I WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES."

"THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 40 FT. LONG AND VERY SLIM. IT STARTED OUT CIRCLING MOTION AND THEN HEADED SOUTH AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THEN IT TURNED EAST AND WEST SEVERAL TIMES IN RAPID SUCCESSION, CHANGING DIRECTIONS VERY SHARPLY, AND ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY CHANGING DIRECTIONS FOR SOME SECONDS."

"THIS OBJECT WAS PECULIAR IN THAT IT HELD WHAT COULD BE DESCRIBED AS A PALE YELLOW OR AMBER COLOR, AND AT TIMES APPEARED TO SHINE OR GLOW BRIGHTLY. AFTER WATCHING IT FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES, IT WENT OUT OF SIGHT, THROUGH THESE GYRATIONS, FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS AND THEN REAPPEARED. THIS OBJECT WAS NOT MOVING AT A CONSTANT SPEED, AND I DID NOT HEAR ANY SOUND FROM IT."

"I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE ITS SIZE, BECAUSE AT THE TIME I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE TO COMPARE IT WITH."

"SHORTLY AFTER THIS WE SAW ANOTHER ONE, BUT THIS ONE DIDN'T HANG AROUND LONG. IT WAS APPROACHED FROM THE WEST AND DISAPPEARED TO THE EAST, NEITHER ONE LEAVING ANY TRACE OF VAPOR TRAIL."

"WHEN I SAW THE SECOND ONE I CALLED OUR STATION AT MINNEAPOLIS AIRPORT AND THE OPERATOR SAID THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED SEVERAL SIMILAR REPORTS AND THAT THIS WAS A RATHER COMMON OCCURRENCE IN THAT AREA."

II. CAJAR

Unknown, but evidently clear.

III. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

Further investigation provided no additional information as to the identity of the objects. The two-mile sergeant was stationed and stated that he could only observe "a brief blur for about two seconds during its brief appearance. He did not get any details and there was no vapor trail gave off no reflection."

All observers were positive of the following facts:

UNCLASSIFIED
CONFIDENTIAL

A. The object, though vaguely defined and blurred, retained a definite shape.
B. No vapor trails, exhaust fumes, or jet propulsion were observed.
C. The object definitely appeared to be controlled. The sources are all experienced observers who reported it in a manner indicating the object was controlled and have been observing all types of balloons for several years.
IV. CONCLUSIONS

No conclusions can be made. It is significant, however, that the sources can be graded as very reliable and that they observed an object with which they were carefully unfamiliar.

A BRIGHTLY GLOWING OBJECT TO THE S.E. OF U. S. AIRPORT. AT THAT TIME WE WERE A FEW MILES NORTH OF MINNEAPOLIS AND HEADING EAST. I POINTED IT OUT TO PICK AND WE BOTH MADE THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATION:
"THE OBJECT WAS MOVING FROM EAST TO WEST AT A HIGH RATE AND VERY HIGH. WE TRIED KEEPING THE SHIP ON A CONSTANT COURSE AND USING REINFORCING MEMBER OF THE WINDSHIELD AS A POINT, THE OBJECT MOVED PAST THIS MEMBER AT ABOUT 50 DEGREES PER SECOND.
"THIS OBJECT WAS PECULIAR IN THAT IT HAD WHAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A HALO AROUND IT WITH A DARK UNDERSURFACE. IT CROSSED RAPIDLY AND THEN SLOWED DOWN AND STARTED TO CLIMB IN LAZY CIRCLES SLOWLY. THE PATTERN IT MADE WAS LIKE A FALLING OAK LEAF INVERTED. IT WENT THROUGH THESE GYRATIONS FOR A COUPLE MINUTES AND THEN WITH A VERY RAPID ACCELERATION DISAPPEARED TO THE EAST. THIS OBJECT, PICK AND I WATCHED FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Subject: Sighting of Unidentified Object

Data of Report: 7 October 1951
Place: Minneapolis, Minnesota
Date of Information: 13 October 1951
Prepared by (Officer): Charles F. Nangle

References (Previous reports reference, etc., as applicable):

Summary: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significance in final one-sentence paragraph.)

This report was completed as requested by the 6520th AISS Squadr on on 13 Oct 1951. The reported sighting occurred at 2100 hours, 7 Oct 1951, in the vicinity of St. Paul, Minnesota. The object observed was reported to be approximately 40 feet in diameter, silvery-white in color, and traveling in a horizontal direction at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. The object was observed for a period of 2-3 minutes before disappearing. The pilot, an Air National Guard pilot, was flying his F-51 fighter aircraft at the time of the sighting and immediately reported the encounter to the Minneapolis Control Tower. Considering the intelligence background of the observer and the fact that there were four men to confirm the sighting, this is a very believable report. It is not believed this type of object is known to the Air Force.

Report No. : 
Page 1 of 2 Pages
The observer, 1st Lt. CHARLES S. HOLT, Jr. USAF, reported sighting a strange object in the sky over the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. The object was first observed at approximately 1700 hours on 12 October 1951 and was last seen at approximately 1730 hours the same day.
DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:
T. C-1. 12 October 1951 : Observed an unidentified object approximately 25,000 ft. in altitude over the Twin Cities area. This object appeared to be approximately 15 ft. in diameter, circular in shape, and aluminum or white in color. The object was observed to be moving at a high rate of speed, estimated to be approximately 1,000 mph. The object was observed to be circling or maneuvering, and was visible for a period of approximately 30 minutes.
2. SUMMARY: The observer feels certain that the object was not a known type of aircraft and has never seen anything like it before. The observer could not determine the speed or altitude exactly, but feels the speed was in excess of 500 mph and the altitude was approximately 25,000 ft. The observer was not able to determine the exact nature or purpose of the object, but felt that inasmuch as it was circling or maneuvering it was not a normal type of aircraft.
3. CONCLUSION: This incident is submitted as an Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon. While the object cannot be definitely identified, the observer's report appears to be credible and worthy of further investigation.

SIGHTING OF FLYING OBJECTS (Cont'd)

This is an additional report to my story of 7 October 1951 concerning the sighting of flying objects. I pointed it out to make the following observations:

The objects were traveling at a very high altitude. We tried to estimate the speed, but we were unable to do so. The objects appeared to be reflecting sunlight or some source of light as they passed over, and at very high altitude. We tried several times to estimate the speed, but the speed was constant and at such a high altitude we were unable to estimate the speed accurately.

The object was peculiar in the fact that we could not describe it as a "thing", it was simply a reflection of sunlight or some source of light. The reflection looked like a flattened tennis ball and started to curl up and flatten out again as it passed overhead. It appeared to be above the clouds, maybe 40,000 to 50,000 feet. We followed this for around two to three minutes, sometimes at intervals of two to three seconds, and at other times for as long as a minute with the naked eye. 

I don't know how to describe its size, because it appeared to be larger than what I have ever witnessed and it looked much bigger than any aircraft we know of.
Shortly after this we saw another one, about two hours later, but this one didn't last as long and neither did the next one we saw. This is the best I can describe without leaving any doubt of what we saw.

We were all very positive on the following major points:

1. Object though visually definite shape or form, was more a reflection of light.
2. No visible trails, flares, exhaust or jet propulsion as we know it.
3. No sound was heard.  
4. Extremely high speed and altitude.
5. Constant speed and direction.
