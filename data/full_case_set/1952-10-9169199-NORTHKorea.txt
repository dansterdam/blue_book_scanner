On 16 and 17 October 1952, lst Lt. William H. Hooper and 1st Lt. Donald I. O'Neil, Instructor Pilot and Instructor Navigator of the 6127th Training Group at K-47 were on a routine training mission in an F-84 type aircraft.

On the morning of 16 October 1952, Lt. Hooper, instructor Pilot and Lt. O'Neil, Instructor Navigator, were flying a routine training mission. At 0955L, Lt. Hooper was flying - the aircraft at approximately 34,000 feet altitude. As he was checking the ball for activity, he observed the object suddenly appear heading west approximately 8-10 miles west of his position. The object was traveling on a magnetic heading of 100 degrees.

Lt. Hooper drew the attention of Lt. O'Neil who did not observe it until the aircraft and the object were parallel. As soon as Lt. O'Neil observed it, the object appeared to be decelerating. Lt. Hooper continued to observe the object as it appeared to be maneuvering. The object appeared to be an extremely bright white light similar to an arc welding light, approximately 15,000 meters from the aircraft's position, traveling on a magnetic heading of 280 degrees.

Lt. Hooper estimates the time of the hovering operation to be approximately 1 second. Lt. O'Neil estimated the time to be about 1 or 2 seconds while it appeared.

Lt. Hooper observed the right wing of the aircraft for a better observation of the object. The object suddenly disappeared from sight in the same manner as its initial appearance and disappeared from sight in the same manner as its initial appearance, approximately 15,000 meters away.

The physical description of the object is as follows: It appeared to be a jet or similar type aircraft, but upon further observation it did not appear to have any structural or aerodynamical characteristics consistent in the present-day aircraft. The object appeared circular in shape and metallic in color with no protrusions of any kind. No exhaust or other propulsive evidence was observed. The estimated size of the object was 20 feet in diameter, by comparison with the 37 foot wing span of the F-84 aircraft. The object appeared to be under observation for approximately three minutes from 0955L.

The object was seen against three back ground, clftnwly at the first sighting.

Hills at the hovering position, and sky as it traveled away, and seemed constant as to size and color to both observers.
The pilots stated that at no time during their observation did the object increase or decrease in size.
The weather conditions at the time was 6/10 covered at 4,000 feet with base variable to 6,000, wind 5 miles per hour to ground 5-1000 feet variable from 5 to 15 miles per hour. Observations were made until the aircraft made a right turn near the end of the observation, when the object seemed to disappear from sight.
It is both pilots are in their thirties and seemed well headed and rational. They reported this incident to their Commanding Officer with no apparent nervousness or haste.
An Intelligence Report 52-276, dated 24 June 1952, Det. 1, 6006th AI 139, APO 970, concerning a sighting on 9 October 1952: On this date, a balloonlike object was observed in the sky in the area of Hill 256, approximately 20 miles northeast of Wonsan, North Korea. The object was observed from 1400 to 1500 hours by an Air Force pilot and an Air Force observer.
The object hovered for some time at an altitude estimated to be 5,000 feet. The object appeared to be round or slightly elliptical in shape, about the size of a weather balloon, and silvery in color. It was observed through binoculars. The object appeared to rotate slowly. No trail or exhaust was visible. Weather conditions at the time were 6/10 cloud cover at an altitude of 4,000 feet with a wind velocity of 5 miles per hour from the west. The object disappeared from view in an easterly direction.
The object was not identified and it is considered that their identification and final disposition remains a mystery.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Date: 24 June 1952
FROM: Commanding General, 5th Air Force, APO 970
Report No: 52-276
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object, Det #1, 5025th ATSq, APO 970
JOHN H. GURNEY
Captain, USAF
Commanding

By/From Command:
This report is in reference to a sighting of an unidentified object observed by observers at Det #1, 5025th ATSq, APO 970. The object was observed to be moving at a high rate of speed, and if hovering, would appear to be moving rapidly. The object was under observation for some time, and if it had been a nearby object, would appear to be much larger than it appeared. Since weather balloons are known to have been used in this vicinity, Det #1, 5025th ATSQ, dated 24 June 1952 is reported in IR-32-124.

STATEMENT
17 October 1952

On 15 October 1952, at approximately 0503Z, the weather conditions were four tenths of cloud cover at 6500 feet and the visibility was estimated to be four miles. We had just finished checking in with the time was Control and were told to call their Control every fifteen minutes. We had just taken off and were climbing to other control points when an object appeared to be an aircraft passing over us. At this time, the object Grid Square 56040 was observed and appeared to be a balloon. It was approximately 17,000 feet in altitude and traveled from East to West at a speed of approximately 100 knots. At this time, there were approximately sixty-three hundred (6300) feet in altitude and the object was approximately 600 mph.

I called the attention of the object to Ist Lt. Hooper for his observation. The first time, I couldn't determine the object and a first sighting, I appeared what may have been a reflection of the sun. As the object came closer, it appeared that the object was approximately 200 feet in diameter and silver in color. The object hovered at this distance for approximately one minute. At this time, the object appeared to increase in speed and speed away from us and disappeared from sight to the West. The object was 25 feet in diameter and silvered in color. Those observing it through binoculars said the object then appeared to be spherical in shape. The aircraft was approximately 6000 mph. We turned the aircraft to keep the object under observation.

The object then stopped for a period of observation and then resumed flight at a high rate of speed and disappeared. Our observation with continued and even the other pilots were wearing Air Force issued sun glasses. The object hovered in Grid Square 56048.

Air Intelligence Information Report
17 October 1952

STATEMEN T
Subject was sighted by a ground observer in the vicinity of the French Fold, DR 2645 at 0612Z, 16 October 1952. The observer reported a luminous object appearing silver in color and about twenty-five feet in diameter. It was first observed at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet over the ground and was descending in a zig-zag motion. The object remained stationary for about 10 to 15 minutes, and then shot upward at high speed in a vertical direction, disappearing from sight.
The pilot of an Air Force aircraft was observing it with the naked eye, and reported that the object could be identified as an aircraft type and that the motion and altitude were inconsistent with a normal aircraft. The pilot stated that the object was at an approximate altitude of 1,500 feet. The object was under continuous observation for about 35,000 feet in such a short space of time.

It was further reported that a large group of aircraft and B-29s of the Air Force were operating in the immediate area at the time, but the object was not identified as being associated with this air operation. The circumstances as outlined against the background position indicated clearly that the object was not a normal type aircraft.
