The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically the "PROJECT 10073 RECORD" form. The form contains textual information about a UFO sighting, including the date, time, location, details of the observation, and the conclusion of the investigation. The text in the form is as follows:

Sirs:
I wish to report the sighting of an UFO over this city at 8:10 P.M. on the 7th of this month, August. See attached sketch.

One typical disc shaped object was observed at 8:10 PM and was observed for 3 minutes and 20 seconds. The object appeared to be metallic in nature and illuminated by a light source. It did not appear to make any sound. The object was observed by two other observers in addition to myself. However, these are on record and if it becomes necessary I shall provide you with their names.

In the last six months several unidentified flying objects have been reported in this area. The observers would not identify their names so I will not report them to you. They would not vouch for that kind of sightings.

Further reports: Due to the brilliant attitude, make it most difficult to obtain reliable data on any UFO sighted anywhere. The physical appearance and motions of these objects or phenomenon defy rationalization according to present technical knowledge or scientific concepts. I have even been told by some reliable observers that these craft have been seen to dispel particles of light or fire as they pass through the atmosphere. Will you please send me your latest summary of unidentified flying objects?

Yours sincerely,

P.S: I enclose tear sheets of UFO sightings over Richardson, Texas, 20 miles south of this place, though you doubtless already have this into. Heff.

Transcript of the text in the document:

MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS SEEN OVER AREA
By GEORGE CARTER
City News Staff Writer
Bright colored lights and strange unidentified flying objects have been sighted over the McKinney area the past two days, according to information received at the McKinney Police Department.
Highway patrolmen also report seeing the strange objects last night. Patrolman Bennett Anderson of the McKinney Police Department said he saw a strange red object hovering in the sky for several minutes about 9 p.m. Tuesday. He said it seemed to be moving in a spiral fashion and then suddenly disappeared.
About 10 p.m. Tuesday, a number of other persons telephoned the police department to report seeing strange lights in the sky. They were described as red, blue and white and seemed to be moving in an erratic fashion.
"We are puzzled by these reports," one officer said. "We have no explanation for them."
The Associated Press reported similar sightings in other areas of Texas this week.
