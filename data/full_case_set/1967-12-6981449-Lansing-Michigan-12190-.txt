AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT REPORT
THE OBSERVER AIRCRAFT
(the object) COULD BE IDENTIFIED AT ANY TIME, ALTHOUGH WEATHER CONDITIONS APPEARED VERY POOR. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS ELONGATED IN SHAPE AND TO BE TRAVELING IN A HORIZONTAL MOTION. GROUND PERSONNEL WERE STATIONED AT THE SITE BUT WERE UNABLE TO OBSERVE OR TRACK THE OBJECT. PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TAKEN AT THE SITE, WHICH WERE LATER ANALYZED BY TRAINED PERSONNEL. RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE OBJECT WAS AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO).
