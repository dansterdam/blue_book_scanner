The image contains two photographs. The larger photograph on the left depicts a silhouette of a person standing on a road surrounded by a hilly landscape. The smaller photograph on the right shows a similar landscape, but with the person standing at a greater distance from the viewer, resulting in the person appearing smaller in the frame.

AFR 80-17(C1)

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE A "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN IT WAS FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "O" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE PHENOMENON LAST SEEN.

(Large compass rose diagram)

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "O" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND "O" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON. FOR EXAMPLE, HOW CLOSELY THE LARGER SKETCH.
