Dear Sirs
I would like to report a UFO:
It was the night of September 17, 1967. In Killeen 
Texas, at 8:10 P.M. it (the UFO) started out in the 
southeastern part of the sky. It went very slowly across
the sky as a normal satellite, but when it got to the eastern
part of the sky it didn't follow the curvature of the earth.
It seemed to stop in mid-air,and went to the right 25 degrees
dropped 20 degrees. When it was dropping there seemed to be
a small white circling clockwise very fast around the UFO.
The time was 8:20. it stopped and seemed to fade out. At
8:30 it faded out.
It made no noise, flying above the clouds.
(It was a P.C. night) no wings seemed to be circular 
in shape, and was 2½ times brighter than the brighest
star.
Sincerely
