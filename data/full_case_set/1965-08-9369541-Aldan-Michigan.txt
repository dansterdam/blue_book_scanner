1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 15/8/65
2. LOCATION: Aldan, Michigan
3. SOURCE: civilian
10. CONCLUSION: Photo (not presently available) is consistent with probable identification of a known object, almost certainly a weather balloon. This sighting, in view of other similar reports, illustrates a continuing problem in the USAF that must be dealt with intelligently.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: According to the report, the observed object appeared as a bright, shiny, round object at a high altitude, moving in a straight path from horizon to horizon. It is concluded that this was probably a weather balloon, based on the physical description and the fact that "other similar reports" were considered.

DATED FOR THE RECORD: 19 AUG 55

Sgt David X Moody spoke with Major Linghan, Capt AFB, APIO, Godh 6128-9154-856. He had just returned from investigating cases. They had no radar reports for that night. The Police Department had received three telephone calls from civilians who had observed unidentified flying objects. Police Department asked the APIO to investigate. Objects were observed last night, 18 Aug 55. One man said he located it as it was a transport-type person saw what Major Linghan believed to be a searchlight. Another person took a photograph of an unidentified object.

It is desired that this information be given to Major Linghan for his use in this instance.

Major Linghan is going to make a final report, SAFOI, this afternoon, 19 Aug 55.

Give the above information to Mrs Hunt, SAFOI, at 1330 hours, 19 Aug

At 1400 hours Captain Parket from Empire AFS called. The three descriptions of the objects observed on the night of 18 Aug 55 were similar: time of observation was 1155 and 1225 (2335 and 2355) local. The satellite Echo II was west of Detroit at 1119, 45° heading 175. The person who observed the satellite and took a picture had observed the object during the previous 1005 at about 52 degrees elevation.

Took a picture with Kodachrome daylight film. Captain Parker will send the reports in because of have media interest, with his comments that he thinks this to be a satellite.
