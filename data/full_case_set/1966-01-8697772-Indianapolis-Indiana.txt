January 14, 1966 - Friday Evening - 8:30 P.M. (former 8:30 Farmer and friends observed a brilliantly lighted disc-shaped object approximately 40 feet in diameter, at a low altitude, traveling at high speed. Leaving an orangish-red trail - just above the horizon (east) over Indianapolis area. Object was visible for about 10 seconds. Sighting lasted for about 30 seconds.

Thanking you in advance,

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a typed letter from the Chief of Project Blue Book, addressed to a person in Indianapolis, Indiana. The letter discusses an unidentified observation that was reported, but it does not have enough information for evaluation. The letter requests the observer to complete a standard form and return it to provide more details.

Project Blue Book (PBB) was a U.S. Air Force program established in 1952 to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). This letter seems to be a response from the PBB office regarding an observation that was reported.

The image contains a diagram with a graphical representation of an observed UFO. The diagram includes instructions for the observer to mark the path and direction of the UFO's movement. There is no photograph present in this image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how low the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "X" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.  

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
