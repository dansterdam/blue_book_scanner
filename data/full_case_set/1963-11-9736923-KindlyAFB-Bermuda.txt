Incident 13 November 1963

Attached is an account received from the Bermuda office of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations concerning an unidentified flying object observed over Kindly Air Force Base, Bermuda, on 13 November 1963.

Apparently the object did not show on any radar screens, and the visual observations were made by several people who were present and observed the object. Since the incident apparently did not come to the attention of the authorities, and no report has been made to Project Blue Book, I am taking the liberty of submitting the account for your information.

In order to make an investigation, it is necessary that the object be observed again, and that the details be obtained from the witnesses. Perhaps you can arrange to have the matter looked into further, and advise us of the results. Any additional information or photographs that can be obtained would be most helpful and interesting.

UFO SIGHTING (ST CLAIR COUNTY, MICHIGAN)
CASE 13-G-62

1. The following information is provided to assist you in a reply to Congressman Harvey regarding a UFO sighting in Saint Clair County, Michigan, on 12 NOV 62.

2. It is believed that the object sighted by Deputy Baker was a helicopter. However, efforts to identify a specific vehicle have proved negative. Reasons for this belief are as follows:

a. During telephone conversation between Doctor J Allen Hynek and Deputy Baker, information received indicated that this was the most probable cause. 

b. A helicopter was observed during the daylight hours on subsequent days by other persons in the area and their stories of the observations were carried in local newspapers. 

c. Efforts to identify these subsequent observations with a particular helicopter proved negative.

3. Should Congressman Harvey desire further investigative efforts to identify a particular helicopter activity in the area, officials at AJrD may be directed to conduct this investigation. However, we feel that additional expenditures of funds and manpower is not warranted in view of the long delay in time since the sighting occurred. Also, we feel there is sufficient evidence to justify an evaluation of this sighting as a helicopter observation.

Dear Mr. Harvey:

The Air Force has completed an investigation made at your request, of an unusual aerial phenomena reported in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, area on November 12, 1953. 

U.S. Air Force Technical Information Forms were furnished to Deputy Sheriff's Robert Baker and Harold Clark in order that they could provide an account as detailed as possible of the sighting. Upon receipt of their reports, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director, Dearborn Observatory, Northwestern University, and civilian observatory consultants to the Air Force on the UAP program, talked by telephone with Deputy Baker. As a result of this conversation, and of Deputy Baker's reports, it is believed that the sighting was a helicopter. While efforts to identify a specific helicopter proved negative, one had been observed during daylight hours in the area, and their stories of the observations were carried in local newspapers.

Sincerely,

SUBJECT: UFO INFORMATION ON UFO SIGHTING
According to information on a UFO sighting by Deputy Sheriff Robert Baker of Leflore County, Oklahoma, which took place on the night of 22 Nov 63, the witness observed an unidentified aerial object (UAO) over Longoria Air Force Base, Bermuda.
The object was described as round, aluminum in color, and appeared to be as large as a house. The object was observed for about 15 minutes making directional changes and varying in speed. However, various articles in the local newspapers have been discovered which describe the incident differently or have no recollection of the report.
Since there seems to be discrepancy and the form was returned to USAF on 13 Dec 63, we are consulting our consultants to the Air Force's project on UFOs, contacted by many researchers, in an effort to determine if the object in question has been observed on other occasions and if additional data is available that could corroborate or resolve the conflict.
We are anxious to complete our evaluation of this case, and request that copies of any newspaper items, however, as of this date we have not received copies of these newspaper items.

The image contains a photograph or illustration depicting what appears to be a bright light or object in the sky, as described in the text above it. The text is a report from Project Blue Book, discussing an incident where deputies observed an unidentified object in the sky.

Text extracted from the document:

"STRANGE LIGHT' OBSERVED

Deputies See Object In Sky

At about 2:30 a.m. Deputy Sheriffs Baker and Clark, along with 3 others, saw a very strange bright light in the sky. They said it appeared to be oval-shaped and was moving erratically. The deputies said it seemed to change color from white to reddish-orange. They watched it for about fifteen minutes before it disappeared. 

Deputies Baker and Clark were extremely excited about the sighting and even called the sheriff's office to report it. The dispatcher, according to the report, was also able to see the object from the sheriff's office but was unable to get a good look at it due to the distance. 

The object was reportedly high in the sky, according to the deputies, and seemed to hover at times. They also said it made no sound and appeared to be completely silent. 

Ralph L. Jordan is a 27-year-old resident of the Bermuda area, and he also reported seeing the strange object in the sky at about the same time as the deputies. He stated that it seemed to change directions and appeared to be several miles away.

We didn't hear anything, but the light was just a steady, very bright light. It seemed to be hovering in the sky for a few minutes, then it just shot off and disappeared."

(Continued from page one)
shoulder of the road and stared
at what they saw. "It seemed
to be hovering over the road," 
they said. It seemed to be
hovering - a bright object in
the night sky. This is Deputy
Basker, an officer with
Bermuda police and Capt. Wallace
of the Bermuda police. They hope
to the object could move
down and examine it closer but
suddenly it just zoomed up and
disappeared." 
"They said that there was a
vivid divided white light emanating 
from the object as it rose upwards
out of sight," Basker said.  
The said the object came low
to the ground, almost to the top
of a city tree.
"Then, as it came, the object
went back down, towards the
north west and we stepped up
to follow it," they said. "But 
when we got there, the object 
had zoomed up and disappeared."
"They said they had sight of
the object for about 5 minutes
and here is a decription of what 
they saw: Round in shape, a bright
white light that did not flicker 
or pulse, no trail of smoke or fire, 
no sound, it just hung there and then 
zoomed up and disappeared."

This time, the officers turned
their lights on and shone them
where the object had been hovering.
The object first appeared in the east
and then it seemed to move to the
north-west. The object flashed on and
off, a bright white light, then it would 
go dim, then bright again. It seemed to
be a solid object rather than an
aircraft with running lights. But it
still was a bright light, almost as
bright as if a searchlight was directed
up at the sky - but it seemed to be
hanging there - a bright light in
the sky. Captain Wallace and Deputy
Basker had the object under observation
for about 5 minutes and then it just
zoomed up and disappeared.
They reported the incident was witnessed
by Capt. Wallace, Deputy Basker, and 
two other officers whose names were
not given.
