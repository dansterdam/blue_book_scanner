AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

A. The flight commander was looking for aircraft of a friendly flight when the object was first observed. It was called to the attention of the pilot as a strange appearing aircraft at an altitude of about 25,000 feet.

B. The object was circular in shape and appeared to be metallic in nature. It was very bright and reflected the sun's rays. It was estimated to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. The object was observed for approximately 2 minutes.

C. The object appeared to be about 25,000 feet in altitude and was moving at a high rate of speed, much faster than the aircraft the observer was in. The object appeared to be traversing a straight course and was under intelligent control.  

D. The object was thought to be about 10 miles distant when first observed. It disappeared from view in a matter of seconds.

E. The observer was an experienced pilot flying an F-86 aircraft. The sighting occurred during daylight hours.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
16 SEPTEMBER 1954

SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object Observed Over Korea
LT COL KENT LEE, Office of Special Investigations (OSI) - Korea, reported that on 8 AUGUST 1954 at approximately 1800 hours, while airborne in an F-86 jet aircraft approximately 30 miles east of Seoul, Korea, he observed a bright circular object at an altitude of approximately 36,000 feet. The object appeared to be brighter than the sun and was approximately the same size as a quarter held at arm's length. The object was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed, many times faster than the F-86 jet aircraft which was traveling at an airspeed of approximately 600 knots at the time.

The duration of the observation was approximately 3 to 5 seconds. After the initial sighting, the object appeared to change course and traveled in a southerly direction. LT COL LEE immediately reported this observation on all command operations.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
1. The following group interrogation was made by Captain Davis concerning a sighting of unidentified objects:
a. Number 1 Crewman: While flying an F-51 at approximately 150 miles per hour between 5:10 and 5:20 pm on 8 August at an altitude of 16,000 feet, he observed a gray obj ect, about 35-40 feet in diameter, traveling at a very high rate of speed. It was flying in the same general direction as the F-51 but at a much higher altitude. The obj ect appeared to be spinning or revolving as it flew. It remained in sight for approximately 10-15 seconds before disappearing from view.
b. Radar Operator: Observed the same object on his scope at approximately the same time and location as the pilot. The object was tracked for several minutes and at one point reached a speed of 1,700 miles per hour.
c. Instrument Technician-Pilot: While flying an F-86 at approximately 30,000 feet between 5:15 and 5:30 pm on 8 August, he observed a white, round obj ect, approximately 30 feet in diameter, moving at a fantastic rate of speed. The obj ect appeared to be glowing and was observed for approximately 20 seconds before disappearing from view.
2. All three crewmembers stated that the ob j ect(s) appeared to be under intelligent control.
3. It is believed that this sighting may be connected with an incident reported at the same time by a pilot of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing in Korea.
4. Air Intelligence considers this sighting to be of extreme importance since it is verified by separate observers and is supported by radar tracking.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PAGE 3 OF 55

On 15 July 1954, the USAF and ARMY Air Defense Units received a strange radar report of unidentified targets appearing and disappearing in the sky over Korea. The targets were reported to be moving at very high speeds. This report is the result of the investigation of this incident.

On 15 July 1954 at 2050/K, a radar station located in Korea detected a number of unidentified targets on their scope. The targets were observed moving at estimated speeds of 600-800 knots at 30,000-50,000 feet altitude. The targets appeared and disappeared at intervals of 5 to 10 seconds, moving in a general northerly direction.

Initially, the radar operators notified the USAF Air Defense Control Center which in turn relayed the information to other radar stations in the vicinity. These other stations also detected the unidentified targets on their scopes and attempted to track them. However, the targets disappeared from the radar screens before any positive identification could be made.

The radar operators stated that the targets did not present the normal radar return of known aircraft. The returns were described as strong, clear and definite. The targets were not accompanied by any visual or electronic countermeasures indications.

The duration of the complete sighting was approximately 10 minutes. During this time, the targets maintained an approximate northerly course and it was estimated that they had covered a distance of 100-150 miles.

The radar operators stated that they have never before observed anything similar to the behavior of these unidentified targets. The targets appeared to be under intelligent control, however, the operators were unable to determine the nature or origin of the phenomena.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT 
REFERENCES: NONE

1. On 20 July 1953, at 0600 hours local time, a USAF C-47 aircraft, call sign AATO, was airborne on a routine administrative flight from Suwon Air Base, Korea, to Taejon. 

2. At approximately 0630 hours, when the aircraft was in the vicinity of Suwon, the pilot and copilot observed a bright light in the sky which they estimated to be between 10,000 and 15,000 feet in altitude. The light appeared to be stationary, and no definite shape could be discerned. The light gradually faded and disappeared from view after about 2 minutes.

3. The pilot immediately reported the incident to the control tower at Suwon Air Base. However, no other aircraft in the area reported observing the light. The weather conditions at the time were clear, and visibility was approximately 10 miles.

4. The pilot and copilot were both career officers with extensive flying experience. They were unable to identify the light as any known type of aircraft, celestial body, or other explainable phenomenon. 

5. The incident was reported to proper authorities in accordance with existing regulations.
