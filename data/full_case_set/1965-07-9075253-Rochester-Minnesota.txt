DATE OF INCIDENT: 3 JULY 65
PLACE OF INCIDENT: ROCHESTER, MINNESOTA

On the night of 3 July 1965, three witnesses and myself observed a strange object in the sky. The object was stationary at first, then started to move slowly east. It appeared to be the size of a major planet in our solar system. As the object moved it appeared to change shape, getting wider and thinner. The sky was clear, no clouds. The object was observed for about 15 minutes. At one point the object appeared to send out a beam of light which lasted for a few seconds.

DETAILS
As stated earlier, my wife and I had retired for the evening. We were unable to sleep and decided to go outside for a breath of fresh air. As we stepped out the front door, we immediately observed a bright light in the northwestern sky. At first we thought it might be a star, but as we continued to observe the object, it became obvious that it was not a star. The object appeared to be the size of a major planet in our solar system. As the object moved slowly in an easterly direction, it appeared to change shape, getting wider and thinner. The motion was very smooth and deliberate, not at all like an airplane or satellite. There was no noise associated with the object. We called to our neighbors, and three other witnesses came outside to observe the object with us.

The object was observed for about 15 minutes. At one point during the observation, the object appeared to send out a beam of light which lasted for only a few seconds. The beam of light was very bright and appeared to be directed downward. After the beam of light was sent out, the object continued its slow, deliberate motion to the east. The object eventually disappeared from view behind some trees. I checked the time, and it had taken the object approximately 15 degrees of arc to cross the sky during the 15 minutes of observation.

Throughout the observation, the object maintained a constant brightness. There were no flashing lights or other distinguishing features other than the changing shape as it moved. The sky was clear, with no clouds. Towards the end of the observation, thin, high-altitude cirrus clouds began to move into the area, but they did not obstruct the view of the object.

After the object disappeared from view, my wife and I went back inside. We were very puzzled by what we had observed. We could find no logical explanation for the strange object in the sky. Although we considered the possibility that it might have been a satellite or aircraft, the object's size, shape-changing ability, and the beam of light it emitted did not match any known aerial phenomena. We remain convinced that what we observed was some type of unidentified flying object.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a typed document. There is text in the upper portion of the image describing something observed that was characterized as very fast and bright. The text mentions that the object was observed by multiple witnesses, none of whom were able to identify it.

Something with such speed and size that it was noticed from 2 separate locations at that total time of observing was of a very definite object over three seconds of observing. 5 o'clock in the the setting when the light went out. It seems some kind of object three witnesses noticed in three separate areas over five minutes time Observed by them in three separate locations and then the light went out. This was noted by three different witnesses, none of whom could identify what they observed.

The text output from the OCR of the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the side that shows how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "B" at the end, and show any changes in direction during the course.
