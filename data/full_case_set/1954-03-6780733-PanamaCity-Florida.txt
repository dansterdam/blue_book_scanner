AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PLACE: Panama City, Florida  
OCCUPATION: Housewife

Substance of reliability: Reliable. Mrs. Cooper appeared very sincere and serious about the matter. However, like Mrs. Cooper, she does not admit to being a poor judge of distance.

(1) - observer states that weather was clear, with thin scattered clouds, and no wind at ground level.

(2) Air Weather Service (Tyndall AFB, Florida) reports on wind data available for the period 5-31 March 1954 only. 
They were: 4,000 ft. 175° at 10 knots; 10,000 ft. 210° at 10 knots; 18,000 ft. 220° at 40 knots; 20,000 ft. to 30,000 ft.

(a) Ceilings: thin, scattered at 20,000 feet. (Rapport for 11:36 AM CST)
(c) Visibiltiy: 10 miles. 
(e) Amount of cloud cover: 0.4 to 0.8 heavy.
(f) No thunderstorms in area.
(g) No detailed meteorological, astronomical, structural, or geometric analysis made. No analysis reported in the area.
(h) No physical evidence of sighting available.
(i) No interrogation or identification action was taken.

The (10) report indicates that since there were twenty six (26) aircraft in the local area at the time of sighting, local radar reports no unidentified sighting at the time of the observation.

Tyndall AFB, Florida. It is the opinion of the preparing "UCO" that since there were twenty six (26) aircraft in the local area at the time, the object was one of these and not a "flying saucer".

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Time of sighting: that visibility was (20) minutes and that both sources admitted being poor judges of altitude. The sighting could possibly have been a local aircraft.

Note: After this report was prepared, the newspaper over the local radio station (Station WDLP). The newspaper stated that a Pyndell pilot had contacted the Tyndall Air Force Base officers to report that he, the pilot, had observed a large flock or birds just shortly before 12:00 hours 12 March 1954. The observation was made from the vicinity of this sighting. The information was called from the newspaper office in an effort to obtain the pilot's name, however neither of the above had any permanent record.

PAGE: FIVE JJEAN 3:A

OFFICE, TYNDALL AFB, FLORIDA: IT IS THE OPINION OF THIS PREPARING NCO THAT SINCE THERE WERE TWENTY SIX (26) AIRCRAFT IN THE LOCAL AREA AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING, THAT VISIBILITY WAS SOMEWHAT POOR, (TD) MILES AND THAT BOTH SOURCES ADMITTED BEING POOR JUDGES OF ALTITUDE DISTANCES, THAT THE SIGHTING COULD HAVE POSSIBLY BEEN A LOCAL AIRCRAFT.

NOTE: AFTER THIS MSG HAD BEEN PREPARED, THE PREPARING NCO HEARD A NEWSCAST OVER THE LOCAL RADIO STATION. THE NEWSCAST STATED THAT A THYRALLIS PILOT HAD CONTACTED THE RADAR STATION AND STATED THAT HE (THE PILOT) HAD OBSERVED A LARGE FLOCK OF BIRDS JUST SHORTLY BEFORE 1233 HRS 6 MAR 54, IN THE VICINITY OF THIS AIRBASE. THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE FROM AN AIRCRAFT. THIS OFFICE CONTACTED THE RADIO STATION AND THE NEWS HERALD OFFICE IN AN EFFORT TO OBTAIN THE PILOTS NAME, HOWEVER NEITHER OF THE ABOVE HAD ANY PERMANENT RECORD.

INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

(1) Description of the object:  
Both sources stated that the object changed shape every few seconds. At first it appeared to be a cigar shape, then changed to a delta wing appearance, and when last observed it had a round, flat appearance.
(2) In size it appeared to be approximately thirty-five (35) inches in diameter. This figure was arrived at by comparing an ordinary beach ball held at arm's length from the observer.  
(3) The color of the object varied as the object changed appearance. Both sources state that during the first and second observations the object was white, with the edges or outline a silvery color. Then less distinct it became pinkish-gray in color.  
(4) Number - negative.  
(5) Persistence - negative.  
(6) Distinguishing Features - negative.  
(7) Trail, wake, or exhaust - negative.
