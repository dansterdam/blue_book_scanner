Transcribing the text from the image:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 28 August 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: 

Quite a lot of people were on the expressway at the time. They noticed the object also and it seemed to attract considerable attention among the motorists. The object moved very slightly and slowly up and down, sometimes disappearing behind the interstate highway overpass and then reappearing. They always moved forward slightly but in reverse, no sound was ever heard. It seemed to move in and out of sight somewhat intermittently. At first it appeared to be quite high up in the sky, however, as your investigator flew over the area in a small plane, the sighting area seems to be pretty close to the ground, perhaps not over 300 feet. My friend and I watched it for some time and were very interested in what it might be.

    Report of Investigation

    Date: 8 August 1966

    Subject: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting

    Witnesses: [NAME REDACTED], [ADDRESS REDACTED], Dayton, Ohio

    Summary of Incident:
    At approximately 2130 hours on 7 August 1966, [WITNESS NAME] reported observing a bright light in the sky traveling in a northerly direction over the city of Dayton, Ohio. The object was described as round in shape, approximately the size of a basketball, and emitting a bright white light. The object was observed for approximately 10-15 seconds before disappearing from view.

    Investigation and Analysis:
    Based on the witness' description, the sighting is consistent with the observation of a bright meteor or other atmospheric phenomenon. No evidence was found to suggest that the object was an extraterrestrial spacecraft or other unidentified flying object. The case is classified as "Identified" and closed.

    Conclusion:
    The sighting reported by [WITNESS NAME] is assessed to be a natural atmospheric phenomenon, most likely a meteor, and not an unidentified flying object.

Text extracted from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: August 26 1965

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

This object was the largest and most vivid of my sightings. It was completely silent and showed no exhaust or flame. The object remained stationary over 10 to 15 minutes.
The object disappeared gradually by going out of sight rather than disappearing abruptly. It did not suddenly go out of sight.
It made no sound whatsoever.

It was like a brilliant (multicolored) source
or not like a normal aircraft type. I did not hear any news reports on this sighting.

It 4:45 AM on August 2, 1965.

Sincerely yours,

Contact with Sulphur Grove balloon launch center, Dayton, Ohio, about balloons being launched on 2 August 66. There was a balloon released at 1815 3 August 66, however, personnel at Sulphur Grove did not believe their balloon was responsible for the sighting, as the conditions at 1815 would have been not in the Dayton area unless under very unusual conditions.

In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give some appearance as the object which you saw.

The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a US Air Force investigation of UFO sightings. It does not contain any photographs, but rather includes a diagram with a curved line and a compass rose, as well as instructions for the reader to draw a picture showing the motion of an object or objects.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
