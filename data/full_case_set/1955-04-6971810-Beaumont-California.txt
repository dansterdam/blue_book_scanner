10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
A 13 year old school boy observed a round, silver, object, approximatly the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length, he observed it for an undisclosed time, after which the object seemed to fade away.

11. COMMENTS
Azimuth of sighting indicates in report lies in direction of air navigational beacon of rotating type. Color reported red and white corresponds to usual color of airways beacons. The age of observer and short duration of sighting preclude any sort of following investigation. 

Conclusions: Probably airway beacon.
