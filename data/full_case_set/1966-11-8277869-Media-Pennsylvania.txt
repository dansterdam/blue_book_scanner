Observers were driving along Route 1 near Media, Pennsylvania, when they noticed a bright light moving at a high rate of speed across the sky. The object was described as being very bright, like a star, and was moving at about 5-20 times the speed of ordinary aircraft. The observers stated the object appeared to be at a very high altitude.

Dear Blue Band,

My name is Raymond Reber. I called you at 7:55 on Saturday morning, November 26, 1966. Because the siting which I reported appeared to be important, I wanted to provide some more details.

The sited object appeared to be oval-shaped and silvery in color. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed and silently. The object was first sighted at about 7:50 AM. It seemed to approach from the east and then disappeared towards the southwest. I would estimate the size of the object to be approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter. While I was watching, the object suddenly changed direction and accelerated away at a very high rate of speed.

I think this sighting is worthy of investigation. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
Raymond Reber

The image appears to show a photograph of what looks like a long, dark object or shape against a snowy or white background. The image has a "MEDIA DEC 23 1966" stamp on it, suggesting it is part of a document or report from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects.

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:
