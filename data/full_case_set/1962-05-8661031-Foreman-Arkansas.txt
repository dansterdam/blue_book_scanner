The image contains two sketches. The top sketch shows a curved line with the instructions "In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it."

The bottom sketch shows two larger sketch areas. The left sketch shows a road passing through a landscape with hills or mountains in the distance. The right sketch shows a smaller, circular view of the sky with some clouds or objects in it.
