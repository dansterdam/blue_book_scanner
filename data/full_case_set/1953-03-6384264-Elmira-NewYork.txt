SUMMARY: On 27 March 1953, this Air Information was sighted by personnel of CCG Post #2 FM 00 Elmira, located at PM 00 Elmira, New York. The object was observed at 1925 ESY at an estimated altitude of 6,000 to 7,000 feet. It moved in a straight course at an estimated speed of 100 to 150 knots per hour. It changed course and descended rapidly, disappearing from view. Sightings were for approximately 5 minutes.
Attempts to obtain a photograph were unsuccessful. Station did not notify this sighting per existing regulation until after it had been reported by the local press.
The authenticity of this report is unknown since observation was for such a short period of time.
These objects were not picked up on radar at this site at any time.
