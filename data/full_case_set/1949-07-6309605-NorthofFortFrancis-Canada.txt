MCIA/XS

This office concurs with paragraph 3 of Comment 1.

1. This office concurs that some of the clinical symptoms of poliomyelitis may be similar to the uranium poisoning the overall clinical syndrome is quite different. Previous in the case of uranium poisoning is very dismal with recovery unlikely. Besides the heavy metal poisoning effect of uranium poisoning, there is also the prolonged and continuous radiation effect of uranium which can be detected in the blood picture. This is quite a distinctive clinical feature of uranium poisoning, which any physician should readily be able to recognize. It is also a feature which does not diminish with time, and hence the patient does not recover. This results because the uranium is a long-lived radioactive isotope, which becomes fixed in the body and cannot be eliminated to any appreciable extent.

3. Because of the above considerations it is the opinion of this office that there is little, if any ground, for the theory that the annual poliomyelitis epidemics are related to radioactivity in any way. It is also to be noted that the annual outbreak of poliomyelitis during the summer months has been prevalent for many years prior to "flying saucers", and the widespread use of radioactive isotopes.

Synopsis

Dr. and Mrs. [name redacted] of Decatur, Indiana, 
were intervied on 15 August 1949, and stated that they had seen an
unidentified aerial object which they thought to be a flying saucer. The
sighting took place 1 July 1949 on [highway 70 about fifty to seventy-five (50-
75) miles north of Ft. Francis Ontario, Canada. The object was described
as silvery gray in color, flying in a westerly direction and was in sight
for about five (5) seconds. No vapor trails or protruding objects were
noted. No sound heard. Dr. [name redacted] opined the object he called
flying saucer may have some connection with the current polio epidemic
prevalent throughout the United States. His basis for this reasoning was
the assertion that of all his polio patients, he could not be certain that
they did in reality, have polio. All however, evidenced symtoms of Uranium
poisoning. Tablulation of myling source sighting from the available sources
of the Indianapolis Star and the Indianapolis News, reveals that the majority
of sighting took place in July and August for the years 1947, 1948 and 1949.
A responsible medical authority, confidential informant, CI-1, advised that
the theory is "interesting" and worthy of further research.

DETAILS

1. This investigation is the result of a report made by Special Agent [REDACTED] & [REDACTED], file #13, Office AFE, dated 13 July 1949.

AT DAHLIN FARM

2. On 15 August 1947, [REDACTED] stated that on 9 July 1947, while on a
fishing trip in Canada, [REDACTED] observed an object in the sky which appeared
to be a so-called "Flying saucer." The unidentified aerial object was sighted
by [REDACTED] 70 miles driving north on highway 70, at a point about
fifty to seventy (50-70) miles north of Ft. Francis, Canada, and near the east
side of Lake of the Woods, Canada. Holling; [REDACTED] attracted his attention to the object. It was on a little driven by [REDACTED] the Highway [REDACTED] observed a silvery gray oblong object flying in a westerly direction. The
air object was about five [REDACTED] feet long, flew a straight path of flight,
with an erratic motion comparable to that of a saucer being skipped across the
the air. The aerial object appeared to be of metal[REDACTED] other than being thrown through
the air. Was not an altitude of about forty degrees(40°) above horizon. It did not
observe exhibit any vapor trail and heard no sound. The object appeared to be about
Likened to an Ercoope [aerail aircraft] two thousand feet.
observed no fins, no vertical trail and heard no sound. After running across his
line of vision, the object was lost from view behind the trees. The day was bright
and sunny, the commissioners veered that he had definitely observed an object in the
air unlike any which known to his idea. [REDACTED] corroborated her husband's statement,
and was unable to add any additional information.

3. Upon his return to Indiana, [REDACTED] contacted several experts in
many Polio cases, which have reached the epidemic stage in Indiana. He was referred
to study, more on the subject of Polio, and states that as a result of his study, he
is not certain that any of the patients he has diagnosed as having Polio, do, in
reality, have Polio. All of the patients however, show symptoms of Uranium poisoning.
[REDACTED] advanced the theory that there may be some connection between the
Polio epidemic and the flying saucers, which by atomic radiation from the so-called
saucer, or by releasing a vaporous matter a great consideration in view the so-called
[REDACTED] acknowledged that this theory may be far fetched, but felt that it would be
worth looking into.

4. [REDACTED] produced membership cards which show him to be a member of
the Masons, Scottish Rite, Knights of Pythias, Loyal Order of Moose and the Eagles.
he served as a naval officer for fourteen months (14) and also held a commission
in the United States Public Health Service.
[REDACTED] lodge as between thirty
five & fifty years (35-50)arial as a graduate of Indiana University School of
Medicine, [REDACTED], Ind., and is an associate editor of the American Medical:
Military Surgeon. He is a physician and surgeon. [REDCATED] are human; and [REDACTED].

5. The following listed persons who were interviewed on 15 Av,ust 1947,
advised that Dr. [REDACTED] appears a reliable, and responsible individual. He

9. A reliable medical authority at Lengjin Harrison AFB, Indiana, was
    contacted by the writer in an effort to determine whether the possibility of
    uranium poisoning, as expounded by Dr. [redacted] in this report, had any
    basis in fact. The cut informant, who preferred to remain anonymous, is hereinafter
    known as confidential informant C.I-1. Informant C.I-1 dIsclosed the writer that the
    Polio period extends from April to October, with the peak months of the disease
    being recorded in July; and August. C.I-1 further stated that the theory advanced 
    by Dr. [redacted] was "interesting" and at least worth further research. Informant
    C.I-1 was doubtful if to show to the conclusion that uranium poisoning could be
    readily asorbed, as he was of the opinion that the U.S. Public had not come in
    with the radioactive element at the chuckholte the road. Still, he finds never been or
    heard. He was suggested that the Aerial Medical Laboratory Research Department,
    Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio, might be able to supply the answer, and that the
    following statistical inquiries may be pertinent:

        (a) Does uranium element produce any physiological reaction
            in human beings corresponding to symptoms applicable to
            any of the so-called Polio clinical and sub-clinical con-
            ditions?

        (b) Are topographical Areas where so-called Flying Disc are
            predominantly (or known uranium deposits) pin points
            of endemic Areas of clinical symptoms resembling Polio?

10. R. R. iHdGiiS, D.D., Chief Toxicologist, Indiana University School of Medicine,
    Indianapolis, L. [redacted] was interviewed on 25 August 1949. Dr. [redacted] stated that in 
    his opinion the possibility of uranium poisoning as advanced by Dr. [redacted] was negli-
    gible. However, [redacted] stated that the latter should be broached to the Atomic Energy 
    Commission, inasmuch as he felt that the AEC to be the only agency in the United
    States capable of answering this question once and for all. [redacted] is personally
    known to Dr, [redacted] as he recalled him as a student who was graduated from Indiana 
    University School of Medicine in 1944, and who was described as imaginative, some-what 
    the best student Indiana University ever turned out; a good boy.

    NOTE: Dr. [redacted] is considered an authority on poisons.
          He is the inventor of the "Duke-a-mcter."
