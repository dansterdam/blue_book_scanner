The image contains two sketches. The first one shows a curved line and instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it, and to place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when the observer last saw it.

The second sketch shows two smaller scenes. The one on the left depicts a road leading towards a town or city in the distance. The one on the right shows a silhouetted figure standing in front of a curved landscape.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

HANPTON, KANSAS

Dear Sir,

In order to satisfy my engineering curiosity I wish to report a sighting I made a few nights ago. My friend and I were driving back to our home in Kansas. We had just left an area known as Battle Hills near Syracuse, Kansas. As we were driving back, at approximately 7 p.m, a bright object appeared in the sky. At first we thought it was an aircraft. However, upon closer observation, the object appeared to rotate and emit multicolored lights in a pulsating manner. It moved at a tremendous speed and quickly changed direction, far beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. Because we could not estimate the height, the object seemed so bright that it blinded us and emitted a strange humming sound. The object seemed to glide motionless for several minutes, and then suddenly disappeared. Will you please let me know if you have any explanation for this sighting? I would appreciate your analysis of this strange occurrence. I believe it may be something which warrants further investigation. I would be glad to provide any additional details that could aid in your analysis.

Respectfully,
