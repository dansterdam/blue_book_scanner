The sighting occurred approximately 10 miles south of CENTERVILLE OHIO, on State Route 48, at approximately 8:20 p.m. on March 6, 1968. The object was sighted by two adults and three children who were traveling in a car. The object was described as being approximately twenty feet in diameter, round in shape, and glowing with a bright orange color. The object was observed to be hovering for approximately 2 to 3 minutes at an altitude of about 150 to 200 feet above the ground. The object then moved off to the southwest at a high rate of speed and was observed to disappear from sight. The witnesses reported that the object made no sound and that there was no evidence of any exhaust or trail. The witnesses stated that they were startled by the sighting and that they had difficulty describing the exact nature of the object due to its unusual appearance and behavior.

The image appears to contain two sketches or technical drawings related to the sighting of a UFO. The larger sketch in the center shows a compass-like diagram with arrows and markings, likely intended to indicate the movement or position of the observed phenomenon. The two smaller sketches on the bottom show rough depictions of the landscape or horizon where the UFO was reportedly seen.

In the bottom paragraph, it states "IN THIS CUSTOM BLOWN, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "3" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN, CONNECT THE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "1' AND "3". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED, OR ZIGZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS SECTION.
