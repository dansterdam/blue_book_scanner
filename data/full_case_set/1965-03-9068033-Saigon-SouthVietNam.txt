Major Quintanilla, Jr.
USAF, Patterson AFB, Ohio

Dear Sir:

Thank you for your letter of 23 March. I quite agree that the picture looks like some familiar object that I took with a 35mm camera. However with the excellent prints that I now have I can clearly see that it was something quite different.

Therefore, I am enclosing three negatives that I took at the same time and the following data:

1) The camera was a Japanese Minoya Autowide C-7000 III L/VBL
2) Exposure time was 1/500 sec
3) From the pilots window of a C-46
4) Locality was near the Plain of Jars, Laos

I will be leaving for home vacation on May 15th. So I would like to know that your reply be sent to the address.

Sincerely, 

Capt. [redacted]
USAT, Painesville, Ohio

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT 
ANALYST: T/Sgt MOODY
PI: KINLEY
DATE: 19 JAN 66

This report is in response to Work Order 65-92 submitted by T/Sgt D. N. Moody, USAF/UFO requesting an analysis of a film strip (3 frames) taken in Laos, March 1965, of an alleged UFO.

The photographs show an aerial terrain view with the unidentified object along the lower one-fourth of the frame. A positive identification of the object could not be made utilizing the limited material furnished. It does appear however, that the object photographed was in close range - both to the camera and the aircraft from which the photographs were taken. The left side of the object as viewed in the photographs appears to be draped with some sort of material or cloth, thereby obscuring that portion of the object. The right extremity of the object affords a short range of the object from the camera, together with the image sharpness as compared with the terrain background, and the fact that subject photography was taken from the pilot's window of an aircraft, tends to suggest the following possibilities: The lodge of the object's wings, together with an unidentified object thereon, including the draping, is the object depicted. Additionally the "alleged" pilot tube is merely the visible portion of some part of the aircraft.

The image does not contain any photograph or visual information. It appears to be a letter or document from the Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is addressed to Captain Fomerly and is requesting an evaluation of a photograph that has been submitted. The letter is signed by Major Hector Quintanilla Jr., the Chief of Project Blue Book.

Dear Captain Fomerly,

Reference your letter of 15 Mar 1965 requesting an evaluation of a photograph which you have taken. The object in the lower left hand corner of the photograph appears to be a portion of the aircraft from which the photograph was taken. I regret that I cannot make any evaluation without the original negative/negatives and camera data such as type of camera, lens settings, focal length etc. 

Sincerely,

The image contains a document page from Project Blue Book, a former U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document appears to be a UFO report with the following details:

SUBJECT: UFO REPORT
ANALYST: T/Sgt MOODY
PI: KINNEY
DATE: 19 JAN 66

The document mentions that a positive identification of the object could not be made, as the photographs were of poor quality and the object appeared to be only a small part of the frame. There is a reference to the "image sharpness" of the object compared to the background and an unidentified object that was seen through the pilot's window.

As an OCR (optical character recognition) system, the text found in the document is:

UNCLASSIFIED
SUBJECT: UFO REPORT
ANALYST: T/Sgt MOODY
PI: KINNEY
DATE: 19 JAN 66
This report is in response to Work Order 65-69 submitted by T/Sgt D. M. MOODY, 48th Transport Squadron, on 12 March 1965. Taken in Saigon, South Viet Nam.
The photographic evidence submitted with this report consists of two frames of 35mm color film. The lower one-fourth of the frames was a positive identification of the object could not be made. The object appears to be a light source or maybe a reflection; however, the photographs were taken through a window and are of very poor quality, so that further analysis is very difficult. Some additional photographs were taken. The left side of the object as viewed in the photographs appears to be slightly blurred or out of focus, while the right side is in better focus. This may indicate that the object was not in the same plane as the background or that the camera was not focused properly on the object. The image sharpness of the object compared with the background and the fact that an unidentified object was seen through the pilot's window, together with an unidentified object thereon, including the shadow, in the object pictured, leads me to believe that the object was real and not a reflection or some similar phenomenon. However, due to the poor quality of the photographs, a positive identification of the object could not be made.

Dear Sir:
Can you tell what it is? Looks like a small airfoil of some sort including a pilot tube; reminds me of a very unusual sort of power plant.
This is my only copy, please return.
