PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE: TIME 3:40 AM
2. LOCATION: Coolville, Ohio
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. MANNER OF OBJECTS: VISUAL
5. NATURE OF OBSERVATION: Over an Hour
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-visual
7. COURSE: Reported
8. PHOTOS: None
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: The observer watched a star-like light in the sky, which then moved to the top and just faded away as though going straight up. It is felt that the observer is unable to easily recognize such stimuli as are usually associated with aircraft, meteorites, and for this reason the sighting is being reported as unidentified for an outstanding report.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten report or document. The text in the document is as follows:

I have become alerted to a series of small, bright lights, coming from what appears to be a metallic, cigar-shaped object, which is presently hovering over an adjacent field. The object is clearly visible and appears to be approximately 50 to 100 feet long, and the lights seem to be located along the side of the object. The object is emitting a pulsating light, which is varying in intensity. On occasion, the object appears to be rotating and the light can be seen moving along the side of the object. At times, the object appears to be reflecting the sun's rays, indicating a metallic surface. The object seems to be making no sound and is hovering approximately 100 to 150 feet above the field. I have been observing this object for over 15 minutes, and it shows no signs of leaving the area. I am unable to identify the object with certainty, but I am convinced that it is not a conventional aircraft. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Transcription of the text in the document:

The light in the sky was bright and lit up the entire area. It hovered almost directly over the tree tops and seemed to be pulsating on and off at irregular intervals. The object appeared rounded or oval shaped, but the light seemed to be emanating from the entire object rather than from one definite source. It was a bright whitish-yellow color and appeared to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter. The object maintained this position for several minutes and then suddenly accelerated to a high rate of speed, moving to the south. It was not more than 200 to 300 feet from the ground and covered the distance of approximately 1/2 mile in only 5 to 10 seconds. There was no sound of any kind associated with the object. It just disappeared from sight at a tremendous speed. I do not believe this was any known type of aircraft. I am quite certain that what I saw was some type of unidentified flying object. I have had some experience observing aircraft and I can say with confidence that this was not a conventional aircraft of any kind.
