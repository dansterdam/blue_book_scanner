Am. I spotted a U.F.O. going N.N.E. It was going E. west. As I could see was about 6 or 7 minutes and I tracked it as far as I could go, and it seemed to be a light red color.

I was told it again, the first time it went over I don't know how long it was, but the first time it went over it had a round circle to it, this last time it seemed to be just a light.

So if you can figure out, if you know something about it, I'd be glad to hear."
