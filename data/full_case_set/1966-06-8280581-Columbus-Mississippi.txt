The text from the document has been fully transcribed here.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document, likely a Project Blue Book report, with a survey form filled out. The form contains questions about the observed object, such as whether it disappeared while being watched, whether it moved behind something, its color, and the observer's estimate of its size.

14. Rea di the objec disce a red while you were watching it? If so, how?
SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED WHILE OBSERVING 

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)  
YES    NO    Don't Know
(If you answered YES, then tell what:)

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One)
YES    NO    Don't Know
(If you answered YES, then tell what:)

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound ABSOLUTELY SILENT
b. Color WHITISH SILVER

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
2-3 DEGREES

19. Draw a picture that (1) show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.

There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a questionnaire for a witness to fill out regarding their sighting of a UFO or similar object.

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before. If so give date or dates and location.
31. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? (Circle One) Yes No

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch diagram. The diagram shows a curved horizon line and a compass rose, along with instructions for the observer to mark the positions of an observed object relative to the horizon and compass.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place an "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

a. Date-Time Group: 8 June 1966 - 2245Z
b. Location: Columbus, Mississippi
c. Source: XXXXX, MSGT, USAF
d. Narrative:
At approximately 2245Z on 8 June 1966, the informant and two other airmen were on duty in the flight line shack at Columbus AF Auxiliary Field, Mississippi. They observed a bright, flashing light in the sky. The light appeared to be stationary and was blinking in a random sequence of red, green, and white flashes. After observing the light for approximately 5 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. The informant described the light as being many times brighter than the brightest star in the sky. Visual sighting only, no other sensors were used.

2. This report is submitted for your information and evaluation.

DESCRIPTION OF UFO
On 8 June 1966, at approximately 7:30 pm CST, Mr. XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXX, Columbus, Mississippi, reported sighting an unusual object in the sky. He stated that he was standing in his back yard when he saw a bright object approaching from the west. The object appeared to be round or oval in shape and was emitting a brilliant white light. Mr. XXXXXXXX estimated the size of the object to be approximately 15-20 feet in diameter and the distance from his position to be approximately 3/4 to 1 mile. He reported that the object hovered for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight in a southerly direction. Mr. XXXXXXXX also stated that the object was silent and gave off no exhaust or trail.

REPLY TO
ATDEER/Mr. Bryant/pk/70401

SUBJECT: UFO Evaluation 

TO: ATDEE (Maj Quintanilla)

1. The information pertaining to the radar portion of this sighting indicates that it was observed by ground radar and disappeared at 15-20 minutes (visually, apparently, for 31 minutes) at a range of 25 miles and disappeared at 10,000 feet. 

2. With no course information, speeds, etc., reported there is no positive way of determining a possible national origin. If there were some indication as to whether conditions for the visual sighting were similar to the radar conditions, it might be possible to remain more certain that the sighting was of the same object. As it is, the discrepancy between the radar and visual observations as to duration, altitude, etc., makes it difficult to assess the true nature of the observation.
