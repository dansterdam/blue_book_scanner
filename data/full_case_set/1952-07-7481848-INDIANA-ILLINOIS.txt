REPORT NO. 1952 - 7 - 7481848  

PAGE 1 OF 2

1. One 24,000 ft long cylindrical object was detected by radar. The object was caught on the permanent radar and a number of times on height finding radar. The object was between 10,000 and 20,000 ft high. It was too dark to visually see any detail of the object.

2. The object was not detected by the radar of the nearest Air Force base between the hours of 1900 and 0700. The object appeared to be traveling slowly and on a level course between approximately 190째 and 205째. There was no aircraft or meteorological data to substantiate this sighting.

3. This sighting was logged through the military and civilian chain of command. No attempt was made to confirm or further investigate this incident until the next day, 7 July 52, at which time no further traces of the object could be found. A study of the permanent radar record was made the following day, but no definite conclusion could be reached as to the nature of the object.

4. The report indicates that the observation was made from an FAA approach control site. Altitude and bearing were obtained from radar. The duration of the sighting was from approximately 0540 to 0600 hours, or about 20 minutes. The object was in sight during this entire period and was observed by at least 3 operators.

UNCLASSIFIED

While flying westbound (250 degrees) 25 minutes North of Dayton, Ohio at 6000 feet, I observed at 2105 hours CST an object first presumed to be a "falling star". It traveled in an arc approximately 10 degrees above the horizon from the left to the right. It appeared to be traveling from SE to NW about 1500 to 2000 M.P.H. The intense brilliance of the object plus its abrupt disappearance leads me to believe it was not a meteorite or "falling star". If so, it behaved as I've never seen one do before.

At approximately 2105 DST I was sitting on the front porch at 11 Old Main Road, Chanute Gardens -- I was leaning back on my elbows watching the sky where a small light from a weather balloon had been shining. Suddenly I observed to my right a brightly lighted object traveling at a tremendous speed. It appeared directly above Hanger #IV, and stationary.

It began to move almost immediately, to the right (west), and disappeared in approximately three (3) seconds. It was dark red in the center, with a strange tint around the edges. As it began to move, it accelerated at a tremendous rate, and appeared to almost instantly up. There was a faint color trail behind the object as it accelerated, giving it the appearance of a comet.

There are also handwritten notes and text describing the sighting, including details about the object's speed, appearance, and behavior.

At approximately 11:11 p.m. on August 1, 1952, the object was sighted by Captain ESPOSITO. The object leveled off and continued on a course to the northwest, appearing as a ball of fire with a tapering tail. The object continued at a very fast speed, and when it changed direction, the object appeared to be rotating. The sighting lasted for approximately 5 to 7 seconds, and the apparent speed was constant throughout.

The text also includes the location of the sighting, which was Apt # 12, 12th Street, Chanute AFB, Illinois, and the observer's name, Captain ESPOSITO.

At approximately 2045 hours one radiosonrle balloon with lantern attached was observed traveling towards WNW at altitude of 3,000-2,000 feet. As approximately 2100 hours, I observed a rocket-like ball of fire, (with a short orange or red tail of flame) traveling at a high rate of speed towards the WNW. No noise was heard and after about seven (7) seconds, this flare disappeared. There were no other objects noted in the sky at this time.

This observation was made at the rear of building F-103A at CHANUTE AFB, Ill.

At 2100 hours I was on duty as officer of operations for a week and 
sitting down, looking up at the stars, when all of a sudden a bright light appeared in a southeastern position of the sky. It appeared to go in a westerly direction at a great speed. I can't say if it disappeared or the light went out. I came into operations and informed the A.C. of the incident, and also checked with the tower and they had not seen it. In my opinion I can't say what it might have been except a comet because the tail it had behind the object, and also the color of it, which was sort of orange around the outer surface and white in the center.

The image appears to contain a photograph, but it does not show any human faces. The image depicts an unidentified flying object (UFO) or similar aerial phenomenon. The text below the image describes the sighting, indicating that a group observed a bright light moving rapidly from east to west in the southern sky. The text also mentions that the object looked like the spot made by a searchlight, but it simply disappeared after traveling roughly halfway across the southern sky.

UNCLASSIFIED
I was part of a group beach near Bridgman, Michigan around 21.00 hours Saturday. Eight of us saw a bright light move rapidly from East to West in the southern sky. This spot of light looked rather like the spot made by a search light such as used by carnivals when the light hits low clouds. The path of this spot was nearly perfectly parallel to the horizon. After traveling roughly half way across the southern sky the light simply disappeared. There was no haze over the lake so there was no definite outline to the spot and it probably appeared much larger than it actually was. I cannot say what the elevation above the horizon was but I would estimate this at about 20 degrees.

To Whom It May Concern:
Subject: Unknown object observed by Captain George D. Keller

Ozark Airline's Flight 305 departed Chicago at 1930 CST. The flight was conducted at an altitude of 10,000 feet MSL and in accordance with Visual Flight Rules. The crew consisted of Captain George D. Keller, First Officer R. Bullard and Stewardess.

First Officer Bullard was flying the aircraft from the left seat; the co-pilot seat was in the right seat. As the flight approached Buckley, Illinois, First Officer Bullard called my attention to a bright object in the sky. It was first observed at about 2015 and was observed for from two to five degrees in an upward line to our line of vision; appearing to be above 20,000 feet and for the balance of the observation, which lasted approximately five minutes, the object maintained a relatively constant position.

The object was in a definite horizontal line of flight traveling from the west, southeast - the line of flight being from the northwest. As the object approached, the crew observed that it appeared to be an intense white light, with a very well tail. By description, the object seemed to be circular or elliptical and was definitely in excess of 500 feet distance. The object then proceeded on its course and was lost to our vision. The signal lights of our aircraft were not turned on at the time it was observed.

To Ferry command at the First Officer said he watched it for approximately five seconds as the range closed, and he did not know what he was looking at.

Ozark Airline's Flight 305 departed Chicago at 1930 CST. The flight was conducted at an altitude of 4,000 feet MSL and in accordance with Visual Flight Rules. The crew consisted of Captain George D. Keller, First Officer R. Bullard and Stewardess C. Lindsey.

We were in level flight over Buckley, Illinois at an altitude of 4,000 feet when I noticed a white light. At first I thought it was a reflection of our position lights. I noticed it was moving at a high rate of speed, about 5,000 degrees per second. It moved so fast that I had difficulty keeping it in sight.

The time I observed the light was about twenty seconds. It moved as far as I could tell, from west to east across the nose of the aircraft. The time of this observation was about 2004 CST.

Sincerely yours,

While my wife, I were walking around the Chanute Air Force Base golf driving range, I noticed a bright light in the sky to the north and about fifty degrees above the horizon. I thought it was a searchlight and I called to my wife "Look, there's a searchlight up there". We watched it for about a minute and it seemed to be quite stationary, with a slight oscillation or waving motion. I did not notice any color change. The light was quite bright and around in shape like a lozenge. The light was slightly elongated, about six times longer than it was wide. I estimated the light to be about 2 to 3 degrees in size. The light suddenly became very bright and in about 5 seconds was gone from sight. We were both quite puzzled by what we had seen. Our best estimate of the duration of the sighting was about 60 seconds.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon 
PLACE: Near Chanute AFB, Illinois 
DATE OF INFORMATION: 12 July 1952

On 12th of July 1952, Lt. Col. [Redacted], Director of Information, USAF, Headquarters, Air Intelligence Division, was informed that a reported unidentified object was sighted in the vicinity of Chanute AFB, Illinois, on 12 July 1952.

On the evening of 12 July 1952, Major XXXXXX, USAF, and 8 1037th AU Unit members were in the vicinity of Belleville, Illinois. At approximately 10:30 p.m., they observed a brilliantly lighted object, approximately twice as large as a B-29 aircraft, traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 20 minutes above the horizon and proceeded in a northerly direction. The object appeared to be accelerating at a high rate of speed as it disappeared from view. It was observed to be emitting a brilliant yellow color as it traveled. It was ball-shaped and seemed to be approximately 50 feet in diameter. It was observed by several other people in the Belleville area also. The object was not picked up on radar, and no sound was heard from the object.

1. The following information was received by this office from Headquarters Camp Atterbury, Indiana:
On 16 July 1952, the 911th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, an Air Force Reserve unit, reported that at approximately 2315 CDT on 15 July 1952, the radar operators on duty observed an unidentified target on their radar screen. This target was picked up at a distance of approximately 10 miles from the radar site, and was tracked for approximately 45 minutes, during which time it was observed to change speeds, accelerations, and general maneuvering characteristics in a manner suggesting an unconventional aircraft. The object finally disappeared from the radar screen at a distance of approximately 70 miles from the radar site, and was observed to have been traveling at an estimated speed of 1,000 to 1,500 mph. Military and civilian personnel on duty at the radar site were unanimous in their statements that the performance characteristics of the object were beyond the capabilities of any known type of aircraft.
2. This office concurs in this report.

1. The following information was received by this office from Headquarters Camp Atterbury, Indiana:

On 13 July 1952, a civilian pilot with a private plane reported sighting an unconventional aircraft at about 3,000 feet altitude over Crawfordsville, Indiana, at about 1930 hours local time. The pilot stated in substance: "At dusk about 2030 hours, 12 July 52, I was flying alone in my private plane in the area of Crawfordsville. As I was approaching the Crawfordsville area, I noticed an object moving rapidly at a high speed from the northwest to the southeast. The object appeared to be about 200 feet long, elliptical in shape, and brilliant in color, somewhat like a neon sign. The object descended to about 3,000 feet and passed directly overhead at that altitude. I was sitting in the car with my wife. No other lights were visible on the object as it passed overhead. The object descended rapidly to an altitude of 500 to 600 feet and continued on its course toward the southeast at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object descended so rapidly that my wife did not have sufficient time to see the object." This sighting was relayed to this office by military and civilian personnel stationed at Camp Atterbury, Indiana, as a credible observation. The observations are based on my experience of eight years as a pilot in the Air Force Reserve.

"The above information in regard to time, appearance, and speed has been confirmed by military and civilian personnel stationed at Camp Atterbury, who observed the phenomenon as described."

2. This office contemplates no further action in this matter.

1. This Office has undetected a flying object seen over Indiana on 7/7/52. The flying object was approximately circular in shape, silver in color, and appeared to be about 25 to 30 feet in diameter. It was observed over a period of about 15 seconds by 4 witnesses, and the altitude was variously estimated 7,000 to 10,000 feet, coming apparently from the Southeast and travelling in a Northeast direction at a high rate of speed.

2. Records, as received by intelligence-observations flight report center, follow: 
Indiana, Gas station having 4 witnesses reporting to have observed a flying object circle over them from Southeast to Northeast at high speed for about 15 seconds until disappearing. (Not identified)

3. Witnesses consisted of 4 gasoline station attendants who saw the object for approximately 15 seconds, describing it as circular in shape, silver in color, and 25 to 30 feet in diameter. The object was flying level at an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 feet and appeared to be traveling at a very high rate of speed towards the Northeast.

6. Captain, A. W. Johnson, Public Relations Officer of American Airlines at Indianapolis Municipal Airport, stated that no American Airlines planes were in that vicinity at the time reported. No explanations could be made to account for this sighting.

Flight 330 American Airlines plane was approaching Chicago from the East about 60 miles north of Indianapolis at the time and was the only plane in the vicinity of the sighting that could possibly have been mistaken for the flying object. However, Captain Johnson stated emphatically that the flight time and direction of this plane could not account for the sighting as described.

Possible explanation: An unidentified flying object with the above described characteristics was seen by 4 gasoline station attendants in the indicated area and at the time specified. The object did not conform to any known type of aircraft and remains unexplained. Estimated number of people who saw the object: 4. Time object was in sight: approximately 15 seconds.

at approximately 2032 hours on 7 July 1952, Warrant Officer     was on patrol at    AFB, Indiana, when he observed a bright light in the sky to the southwest. He stopped his vehicle and observed the light for approximately 10 minutes. The light appeared to be stationary, then it began to move rapidly to the northeast, finally disappearing. The light was described as being round in shape, very brilliant and extremely bright, emitting a blue-white glow. No sound was heard. During the observation, the observer attempted to call the command post to report the sighting, but the telephone line was busy. This report has been classified as unidentified.

A bright light appeared in a southeast portion of the sky. It appeared to be a small, round object and seemed to be moving slowly. I watched it for several minutes and it seemed to be drifting in a southerly direction. As it disappeared I could still trace the object by the light, as it did not appear to be as bright as the stars. It disappeared below my line of vision. I could not determine the size or speed of the object and it did not appear to be flashing or have any other distinguishing characteristics.

COPY OF STATEMENT OF G. 95638 7 July, 1952.
I was not a participant in the alleged sighting. I simply heard the story from an eyewitness. It appears to be a fairly well documented case and I believe the eyewitness to be reliable. The story is as follows:
On the night of July 2, 1952, at approximately 10:30 PM CST, four persons, two men and two women, were driving west on U.S. Route 50 a few miles west of Vincennes, Indiana, near the Illinois border. 
They observed a bright light in the sky ahead of them which appeared to be stationary. As they approached, the light moved rapidly away, made a sharp turn, and then continued to move away at a high rate of speed. The light then appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet. It was described as being brighter than the planet Venus and about the same size.
The driving witness was a businessman from Springfield, Illinois. The others in the car were his wife and two friends. All four witnessed the incident. The location and time given by the witnesses are consistent with the Air Force records for this date.
I have no further information concerning this case. If you require any additional details, I would suggest that you contact the witnesses directly.

SIR:
The officials of Project Blue Book already have reports of an aerial object seen in the vicinity of Indianapolis, Ind. on the night of 12 July 1952. The object was observed by my wife and I and it is our duty to report as much as we can in view of the fact that we saw the object and feel it is our responsibility to provide all information possible concerning this incident. The object was very good. The following is an account of the incident as I saw it:

On the night of July 12, 1952, my family and I were attending an outdoor theater in the vicinity of Indianapolis, Ind. At approximately 9:10 p.m. CST, my wife and I observed an object in the sky, this object was traveling in a north-westerly direction. It looked larger than any star and was going in a north-westerly direction. It seemed to be traveling much faster than any jet or aircraft we have ever seen. There appeared to be a very slight glowing tail or exhaust. It seemed to be at an altitude of approximately 20,000 to 30,000 feet. The sighting lasted for about four seconds. It was initially seemed to fade and wink out. But it seemed to me that it was at an altitude of perhaps one hundred miles per hour.

It is quite possible that this object was motor or fireworks, but it is like none I have ever seen. I could hear no planes in the vicinity, neither could I hear any sound from the object. I hope this has already been explained, if not I hope you can explain it.

Respectfully,

The text in the document is as follows:

Arnold Mo. Aug.17, 1964
Project Blue Book Info. Officer
Pentagon, Wash. D.C.
My Dear Sir;
First let me thank you for sending me the bulletin on U.F.O.'s. --It is very interesting.
This letter is intended as a commentary on the accompanying "note" and discussion of a case relating to the (Hope) flying saucer incident in 1952. I am 47 years old, male, and belong to no group engaged in promoting the flying saucer theory, either commercially or otherwise. I have always been a strong opponent of saucers and have on many occasions told Air Force gentlemen in your search for an answer to this perplexing and highly controversial subject.
Prior to the enclosed sightings,I had no preconceived notions on UFO's,although like millions of other people I have very much of the impression that they do exist. The first sighting (Aug.28,1948) took place while my wife and I were driving a small farm in the vicinity of the hamlet of Rock,Mo. about 12 miles south of the city of St. Louis on Highway 61. I reported this sighting to the director, but in the course of time, it seems to have been misplaced or lost.
In 1952 I submitted a report of the enclosed phenomenon again to an organization in St. Louis,but was unable to receive any further information as to its findings. I submitted other reports of sightings and thanked me for same, but this has never satisfied me - - I was to ensure that this information reposes in Air Force hands where it rightfully belongs. (I did not submit the July 12 sightings, to compile it had not occurred at that time).
Since the recurring experience,I have no reason to think quite differently about flying saucers than I did prior to same - that they are nothing more than an illusion connected with the following air phenomena:
1. Astronomical optical illusions--of the following: a few personal conclusions I have drawn that you may (or may not) be interested in sharing.
A.	It is my belief that so called"flying saucer" and related phenomena are manifestations of existing electrical disturbances in the atmosphere and that no visitation in the last decade (more or less) but are "gand and phantom" that possibly have indigenous with man for some time.
B. I further believe that these "objects" are capable of materializing and dematerializing instantaneously and at will.
C. That, though they may be entirely capable of interplanetary flight,they are not necessarily "space ships"over,please

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a typed document or report, with text discussing radar reflections and "things". There is no identifying information about specific individuals. As requested, I will now proceed to extract all the text from the document:

That though giving back radar reflections, they are not "solid" in the accepted sense, but are more in the nature of "living nature."

In conclusion let me say that I think that those "things" and have caused all sorts of trouble to crash pictures the following-- a commercial airliner, or any aircraft, is merely--is (just routine practice) quickly dead ahead, closing on collision course, throttle back,(just routine practice) suddenly dead ahead, closing on collision course, throttle back--not any time for evasion---not time for anything---just another unfortunate and unaccountable air-craft disaster.

I hope I have not bored you too much.

Sincerely and respectfully yours

P.S. Would you be so kind as to let me know if you receive this report--I am not seeking any publicity, but I have put considerable effort into this writing and I would like to know that it got into the right hands.--also, you may use this information as you may see fit.

The following day it was reported in the St. Louis Post Dispatch with photo reproduced showing a bright light like object with lots of other people seeing the same thing that evening.
I might change the above "plan by everyone 'to avoid many in our vicinity".
On the same evening and at a time fighting here this UFO seemed to be followed by another 6 or 7 which of course were very near and followed by respondent from the same lake of visual range - then followed by a little east or north - then followed on the positive that it was a specific written note a video reported that could be in the other sighting (over).

COPY.

Air Technical Intelligence Center, 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio.

Dear Sirs:

I wish to report having seen a "Flying Saucer". It may have been one that could have been recorded by your project, and I want to relate the circumstance of its existence. 

I was on a vacation camped on a small lake called Rock Island Lake which is near Tavern Lake about eighty miles north of Kankakee, Illinois. It was about nine o'clock in the evening and the sky was perfectly clear and the moon was perfectly clear and about half full and at a height.

Suddenly under the moon and at a height about halfway between the horizon was a sight which traveled from east to west perfectly horizontally and it seemed very fast. Its apparent size was about twice the size of an average star. When it disappeared I could not be sure whether it went behind the hills or whether its light went out, but it seems to me to have remained apparently the same during the time it was in sight.

Its appearance was as if it were made of clear plastic containing a brilliant white light. The main body was a disc, the thickness of which was about one-sixth of its diameter. As the rear was a blunt rounded nose about the shape of the front of an aircraft nose and toward the rear the sides became blunt and almost flat. There was no visible motion and no noise and its appearance was as well as I can draw it.

For two days afterward I tried to convince myself that this was a reflection or could be explained some normal manner as to go up to one or two seconds from an attitude of almost complete disbelief to one of firm conviction that this thing exists and that I saw it.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir:

I have filled out the questionnaire sent me 
on August 18th and am returning it herewith.

I am also enclosing a copy of my first letter
reporting this sighting. After twelve years I
have no reason to change any part of this letter
except for two minor corrections which I have noted.

I shall recall with amusement some carefully
disguised questions in the original questionnaire
which seemed in effect if you had been drinking
before the sighting. My reply was that I hadn't 
been drinking before, but that I seem to be on to
the gag and afterward.

I was considerably "shook up", and still am
whenever I think about it.

My interest in this matter has not been renewed,
and I will be glad to have any further information
you may be able to give me.

Yours sincerely,

Walter Gurthentin, Jr." who is writing to the Air Force Esa in Dayton, Ohio. The letter discusses a newspaper article that the writer had previously reported on and provides some details about his observations of what he believes to be a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The letter contains no image, only the handwritten text.

Capt. Walter Gurthentin, Jr.
United States Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir,

In a recent newspaper article, a discussion of the previous six or seven years ago when I reported a sighting and I am still quite positive that mine is probably one of the sio.

I think I made one error in my report. I believe I was mistaken on the direction of movement. It seem moved from east to west and it was moving very fast. I know it was not a conventional aircraft and it could not possibly have come from AMB to SDV.

Haven't had a bit of luck in reporting this in 8 years and still feel convinced that I saw something unusual. I have seen aircraft, astral bodies and all types of natural phenomena, but this was unlike anything I have ever seen or heard of before. This theory doesn't hold up. 

If I did not keep a copy of my report, would it be at all possible for me to get a copy of it? And check it.

Yours sincerely,
(Signature redacted)

Referring to your letter of July 24th. The sighting identification claim which was on July 11th, 1952. My first letter was written on July 29th, 1952. The letter sending me the questionnaire was dated August 20th, 1952, and the questionnaire was returned a few days later.

The location was at a lake (Cook Island Lake) about several miles north and a little west of Kamloops, British Columbia. 

I have a fishing cabin on this lake and go there every year. It is interesting to me to watch the weather and see what's going on. I saw something and still haven't the slightest idea what it was.

UFO SIGHTINGS ON 6 DEC 63
WAS SHAPE OF SAUCER (Mrs. Celeste)
WASH D.C. 6330

1. In reply to request of the reports from Mr. [REDACTED] in a letter dated 17 August 1964:

2. The observation of 6 July 1952 did not contain the duration of the sighting. The object was circular, white in color, and disappeared into the distance. The estimated size was 20-25 feet diameter. The object was observed for approximately 30-60 seconds. It did not indicate that sound accompanied the sighting. The object was observed from the window of a restaurant and there was nothing around the object to indicate its size. Due to the close proximity of the object to the observer, and the slow speed for 10-15 mph, the observer is certain of the observation.

3. It is suggested that an ELT form 164 be forwarded to Mr. [REDACTED]. We are unable to explain this observation on the data presented.

4. Regarding the sighting of 29 August 1963 we are again at a loss to explain this observation. The object appeared below and behind a house and a telephone pole. The motion cannot be compared with any known aircraft. The description contained the basic data required for evaluation. Since the sighting is several years old it is not feasible to conduct an investigation. Any information that should be given a more or less routine response.

This page of the document does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a textual description discussing various aspects of a "2-dimensional projection" or "UFO projection". The text mentions that the "minimum silhouette" of the UFO should be considered its "minimum silhouette". It also notes that if the object were truly 2-dimensional, it would show no silhouette. The text analyzes the characteristics and implications of this "projection" phenomenon.

The full text of the document is as follows:

Perhaps you may think me guilty of excessive counsel, but there is another thought that occurs to me in connection with fighting.

This U.F.O. presented many of the aspects of a 2 dimensional "projection";--we are all familiar with the manner in which a wire, which is actually a 3 dimensional object, can be made to appear as a 2 dimensional "minimum silhouette" by a point-like source of light. The U.F.O. did quite the same thing--it presented a "minimum silhouette" which may have been its actual maximum size, or it may have been only a projection of a much larger 3 dimensional object.

It is quite natural that if it were 2 dimensional, it would show no silhouette at all. Therefore, one is led to wonder whether this "minimum silhouette" was not in reality the maximum size of an object projected in 2 dimensions. In that case, the real 3 dimensional object may have been much larger.

The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings.

The text on the page describes details of a UFO sighting, including the duration of the sighting, the observed movements of the object, and the responses of the observers. The text also includes a statement cautioning the reader not to interpret the report as complete and advising that the details provided are intended to be factual and not speculative.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

How long original "glob" U.F.O. had been adjacent to utility pole prior to discovery it have maintained stationary for a period of approx. 2 seconds.

Also, after original "glob" "divided" into three, there seemed to be some diminuation in size relative to parent sphere.

The scene of sighting is five sights of one mile off U.S. highway 51, and we not subject to any traffic notice.

"Earth seems to have affected when we observers were out-doors."

You may ask-- "How do you know UFO was small and close up?" I have anticipated this and my answer is this: The clearty of definition and the considerable detail-the contrasting conditions--you may rest assured of its proximity.

I hope you do not find this redundant,--I am just endeavoring to be as complete in my report as is in keeping with the facts and nothing more.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter or document from someone named Arnold, Missouri 63010, addressed "To Whom It May Concern". The letter discusses the author's personal observations and impressions of various phenomena that they felt were neither solicited nor appreciated. The author expresses a sense of duty to provide their personal impressions of this "manifestation" and discusses their feelings about the nature of the observed phenomena.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

I was well aware of the fact that the personal "opinions" and "theories" of observers of these various phenomena are neither solicited nor appreciated, but I feel it my duty to give my personal impressions of this "manifestation" -- --to wit-- 

I had the distinct feeling that we,the viewers, were the objects of "observation",and not the other way around. That this "object" was not " solid" in the accepted sense,I feel certain ---- rather,it seemed to be living, sentient energy displaying intelligence and even (at least I seemed to sense) a very sense of humor. ----If not to use we yokels, why the blatant and open display complete with weird transfigurations? -- -I felt it was "laughing at us"

I have presented the facts to the foregoing to the best of my ability and with no exaggeration,and also with no deliberate intent to mislead or deceive.

We all know that the practice of deception and quackery is what makes the word of honest folks subject to doubt, so please accept this in the spirit with which it is submitted-----in the interest of scientific truth.

Signed:
Arnold, Missouri 63010

In a halo of many colors - 
Surrounded by a mist
Illuminated - somewhat - it
glowed and pulsed as it moved slowly in the sky

It moved along a curved path
Occasionally it would stop and hover still for a few seconds, then resume its slow paced movements.
On occasions it would blaze up brightly and dimly as if controlled by some outside force. 
At times it appear to distort into strange and unusual shapes, then revert back to its normal shape.
The object appeared intelligently controlled and was observed for almost 45 minutes before disappearing from sight.

Project Blue Book Investigation Report, Case 7481848, 1952-07-07, INDIANA-ILLINOIS

May indicate of possible dight and night
ocuur recently - of at least
one or more night - light observers
In general lypee, of light as 
remarked on the comment
Experienced only slight velocity.
Please write report for
Reamrks - While the light observed in
general by the observers of
this report should be - -
reexamined. I would consider
it highly possible that
it was in the nature of
a - natural or man-made
object rather than an 
unidentified flying object.
In view briefly, also I
would say there is hardly
enough in this report to
conclude one way or the other.
So far no analysis could be
made except to say this
report by itself contained
nothing unusual to all.
It might be advisable that 
field interview be conducted
of the observers mentioned
in order to obtain more 
detail concerning this incident.

The image contains a photograph of a sketch that appears to depict the shape of a UFO. The sketch shows an oval-shaped object with the label "Direction of Flight" written below it. The text in the image states that there was "No sound, exhaust, or vapor trail" associated with the object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Behind some hills

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: Some hills, probably

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of: No

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None
b. Color: Brilliant white or blue-white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you can perform this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? If it was about twice (or a little more) the apparent diameter of the object as I recalled, the object must have been quite small, possibly as it rose up to the time I stopped observing.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Let's and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. 
No sound, exhaust, or vapor trail.

Dear Sirs:

I wish to report having seen a "Flying Saucer" last me say that I do not know the exact circumstances could have subjected to these observations. The circumstances were these: 

I was on a vacation camped on a small lake called Rock Island Lake which is near Tacoma, Illinois about thirty miles north of Danville, Illinois. On the morning of Friday, July 11th, I could not sleep so got up and went down to the lakeside. It was dark and I could just see the outline of trees against the sky. The sky was perfectly clear and the moon was full and at a height of about forty degrees above the horizon.

Suddenly under the lake height about halfway between the moon and the horizon my eyes caught this light, which traveled from east to west immediately and was in sight for about four seconds. It had no way to judge its size or altitude but it appeared to be larger than the diameter of the moon. When it disappeared it didn't seem to be because of clouds or whether its light went out, probably to the former. Its size seems to me to have diminished during the time it was in sight.

Its appearance was as if it were made of clear plastic containing a brilliant white light. The main body was a disk the thickness of which was about one-sixth of its diameter. At the rear was a brilliant glow rounded nose about the shape of the nose of a revolver bullet. There was no sound heard.

For two days afterward I tried to convince myself that this was a reflection or could be accounted for by some normal means but have been unable to do so. My thinking changed so one of film conviction that this thing exists and that I saw it.

Yours sincerely,

Dept. of the Air Force,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Sir:

I have filled out the questionnaire sent me on August 18th and am returning it herewith.

I am still very much interested in reporting this sighting. After twelve years I have no reason to change any part of this letter except for two minor corrections which I have noted.

I still recall with amusement some carefully disguised considerations in the original questionnaire which suggested that I had been drinking before the sighting. My reply was that I hadn't been drinking before, but that I sure went up to the cabin and took a good stiff one afterward.

I was considerably "shook up", and still am whenever I think about it. 

My interest in this matter has not been renewed, and I will be glad to have any further information you may be able to give me.

Yours sincerely,
[Signature Redacted]
