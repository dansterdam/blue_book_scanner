Dear Sirs,

The article in drawing, showed through the paper very plainly. The drawing was of a cigar-shaped object with a light underneath illuminating it, and a series of bright lights on the rear of the object. The object was about 150 to 200 feet long, and was hovering about 50 to 60 feet above the ground. It was moving very slowly in a straight line and remained in sight for about 3 to 5 minutes. Then it suddenly sped up and shot away at a terrific speed. This is the full account of my sighting. Please acknowledge receipt.

Be described in 99% of the cases it was stated that (3) spearhead shaped at Broad moved down and around and hovered Estimated diameter - 50 ft. it stayed three minutes and 17 seconds - Moved closer - noticed smaller clusters of lights at rear - moved slower - disappeared after 2 minutes longer. Reappeared again in about 5 minutes and 30 seconds and kept closer observe and from time to time would move ahead rapidly then back and around and would disappear for a few seconds at a time, this pattern kept repeating itself. At one time it hovered over the power lines near the eastern edge of Jackson. Did not move power lines or electrical installations in any way. Appeared to be a silvery disk shaped object with green lights at the rear. Shape could be seen even when the green lights were not visible. No sound heard nor vapor trail nor engine noise of any kind.

"and soaring around and the 2:55:00 a.m. time period. My two children did not see the object. We heard a noise and I went outside to investigate. The noise seemed to be coming from the east and it came closer and closer. It was a bright light that was pulsating and seemed to be suspended in the air. It came to a point directly overhead and then started moving away to the east. As it moved away, it seemed to increase in size and became a long cigar-shaped object. It did not have any wings or tail. It just moved away silently and seemed to be under intelligent control. We watched it for several minutes until it disappeared from sight. It was a clear night and we had a good view of the object. I am certain that what we saw was not an airplane, satellite, or any natural phenomenon. This object was definitely under intelligent control and did not conform to any known aircraft. I am convinced that what we saw was a genuine UFO sighting."

P.S. I told you that I didn't think they would admit to sighting anything themselves - I know they won't think it is important. But if you will get them to send me a letter saying they did not see anything, I will be satisfied with their cooperative message.

Dear Sir,
On that date around 6:45 I was outside and noticed a peculiar object in the sky. It was round and appeared to rotate or spin. It was also making a slight humming noise. The object was about the size of a large airplane and was about 1000 feet in the air. It remained in the same position for around 5 minutes before disappearing suddenly. I have no explanation for what I saw. Please let me know if you need any additional information.
Sincerely,

U.F.O. Observation
(on 3*15*66)
This report Is being madé  W.C.
With reference to my observation of what I believe to be
an Unidentified Flying Object, on the night of 3-15-66 at approx:
10:15 p.m., while driving home alone, about 12 miles N.E. of
Jackson, Ohio.
The object in question appeared to be hovering approx: 100 yd's
(yards) off the road, about 30 ft. above the ground. It was round
in shape, and appeared to be approx: 25 ft. in diameter. It had
a white glowing light around its entire rim, and a bright white
light in the center which appeared to be pulsating. The object
was not making any sound whatsoever.

I observed the object for approx: 1 minute before it appeared
to make a very rapid and sudden change in direction and speed,
heading in a N.N.E. direction, at a very rapid rate of speed.
It disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. 

I am a sober, intelligent person and I realize that what I observed
may be quite unusual, but I can assure you that I am telling the
absolute truth, to the best of my knowledge and recollection.
I would like to cooperate fully with your department in any way that
I can, as I feel this is a matter of great importance and should be
thoroughly investigated.

Thanking you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Respectfully yours,

(Signed)

Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Text transcription from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 21 June 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: As a U.F.O. is sighted, the small and weak and poor in appearance. It is not a airplane or helicopter but a small saucer looking thing. It came up out of the swamp moving very slow, and went back into the swamp, the light was very dim. There was no sound at all and only lasted about 15 seconds. The shape was round and about 15 to 20 feet across. There was a glow all around the object and the color was yellowish white. A faint outline could be seen and there was no wings, propellers or jets. It flew level and did not change altitude. As it went back into the swamp, it appeared to sink down and disappear. There was about 100 yards visable at the most. The object was close to the ground, about 50 to 75 feet. I would judge the speed to be about 15 to 20 miles per hour. The object seemed to be under intelligent control. I am certain that what I saw was definitely not any known aircraft.
