16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound __________________________________________________________
b. Color ___________________________________________________________

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically indicate trails or vapor trails. Plus an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a series of questions and handwritten responses.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. FEET.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length? (Circle One): c. Half dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22): a. Certain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Disappeared behind other objects out of sight.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make this large object that you saw, and what shapes would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

I see a large disc-shaped object that flew rapidly across the sky and disappeared behind other objects, obstructing my view. The object appeared to be metallic and very bright, reflecting sunlight. It moved with great speed and in a smooth, controlled manner. I cannot say with certainty what the exact size of the object was, but based on its comparison to a half dollar held at arm's length, I estimate it to be quite large, perhaps the size of a small airplane. Although I did not see the object land or change direction, I have a clear mental image of what I saw in the sky that day.

Transcribing the text from the document:

This is really a weird object that appeared over my house last night. I watched it for about an hour or so as it just hovered there. I called the Police and the Sheriff's Office, but they said they were not interested. The object finally just disappeared, but I'm still shaken up by the experience. I wish I could have gotten a photo of it, but the camera was not working. I hope this report is of some use to your investigation.

Dear Sir:

First November 29-1959, I sent you a Report on 4 flying saucers seen by me in Flagstaff, Arizona. I also forwarded a drawing of the same.

Since none of my letters and records have received any notice whatever, and as I have no hope of ever hearing of them, will you please simply acknowledge the receipt of this, and, if you can, let me know if I will be notified later on if the saucer case is found to be of enough importance to be investigated?

Thanking you in advance, I am,
Very truly yours,

Apparently must often I learn the wonder. I beg you to accept this and to continue your investigations in this matter as I sincerely believe some are good and haphazard.

1. On 29 February 1960, Mrs wrote to ATIC requesting the return of a colored sketch of an unidentified flying object. Mrs wrote the sketch to the Air Force as a part of a report made by her on 10 November 1959.

2. The objects sighted by Mrs in November 59 were probably birds, but the information provided ATIC was not sufficient to make a conclusive evaluation.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"This may convince many on the point. I do not know how I can convince you - - -
I am now convinced that what I saw on the night of November 5, 1959 was an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) and not a conventional aircraft. It was a bright light, highly maneuverable, that hovered in the sky for several minutes, then suddenly shot up at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. I was driving along a lonely road at the time, and the object was not affected by clouds or atmospheric conditions. It clearly was not a star, planet, or any known type of conventional aircraft.

The object was totally silent, and seemed to be under intelligent control. It made abrupt changes in direction and speed that would be impossible for any known aircraft. I watched it for about ten minutes, and its performance was completely different from anything I have ever seen before. I am convinced that what I saw was a genuine UFO, and not just some misidentification of a conventional object.

I realize that this is a controversial subject, and many people are skeptical about the reality of UFOs. But I can assure you that my observations were accurate, and I have no reason to doubt what I saw with my own eyes. I hope that my account will add to the growing body of evidence that UFOs do indeed exist, and that they represent a phenomenon that deserves serious scientific study and investigation."

Alright, I've talked this over with myself and my self and I cannot believe I was so inconsiderate of my friend's viewpoint. I regret having been so overbearing in my conversation and attempting to impose my own views so forcefully. My friend clearly has strong feelings on this matter, and I should have listened more carefully and with more empathy instead of pushing my perspective. In the future, I will try to be more mindful of hearing others out and considering their perspectives, even when they differ from my own. I value this friendship and don't want my stubbornness to damage it. Thank you for your patience - I clearly have more to learn when it comes to having productive, respectful dialogues.

"a part they appeared to be doing while hovered over a few feet, but suddenly rising straight up into sky - very rapid climb, and lost to sight in a few seconds. A dozen or so hovering at about 2000 ft. altitude in a strange formation like a bunch of grapes, moving about here and there - climbing, circling, then hovering again - finally one by one shooting straight up and away. A few of them a dazzling silvery color. There was a kind of iridescent shell around them at times, something like mother-of-pearl effect. Not ony my own observation, but witnessed by a number of other persons. They seemed utterly unconcerned about being observed. That baffled me - as to why they were so indifferent to being seen. I wish I could give you more detail, but that's about all I can recall. You probably know far more about these things than I do."
