OCR text output:

X-15 PILOT SHOWS HIS FILM

HOW JOE WALKER NEARLY BROKE THE NEWS

ON APRIL 17, 1962 PILOT JOE WALKER OF THE X-15 ROCKET RESEARCH AIRPLANE NEARLY BROKE THE NEWS THAT HE HAD PHOTOGRAPHED WHAT APPEARED TO BE AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) FROM HIS ROCKET PLANE ALTITUDE OF 50 MILES ABOVE THE EARTH.

WALKER'S FILM SHOWED A METALLIC DISC-SHAPED OBJECT MANEUVERING NEAR HIS X-15 DURING THE FLIGHT. ON RETURNING TO EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, WALKER HANDED THE FILM TO BASE PHOTO INTERPRETERS FOR PROCESSING. HOWEVER, BEFORE THEY COULD COMPLETE THEIR ANALYSIS, WALKER'S DRAMATIC NEWS WAS ALMOST RELEASED TO THE PRESS.

WALKER HAD STARTED TO TELL NEWSMEN ABOUT HIS FILM AND THE UFO SIGHTING, BUT WAS STOPPED BY AIR FORCE OFFICERS WHO ORDERED STRICT SECRECY ON THE ENTIRE INCIDENT. THE FILM WAS THEN RUSHED TO THE PHOTO LABORATORIES FOR THOROUGH OPTICAL ANALYSIS.

AFTER CAREFUL SCREENING AND STUDY, AIR FORCE SPOKESMEN REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT ON WALKER'S FILM APPEARED TO BE A SMALL METALLIC OBJECT, POSSIBLY ANOTHER SATELLITE OR SPACE DEBRIS, RATHER THAN A STRANGER CRAFT. HOWEVER, MANY OUTSIDE INVESTIGATORS HAVE EXPRESSED THE BELIEF THAT THE OBJECT WAS DEFINITELY A UFO.

MEANWHILE THE AIR FORCE HAS MAINTAINED STRICT SECRECY ON WALKER'S FILM AND THE INCIDENT. IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE FULL DETAILS AND CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THE PHOTO INTERPRETERS HAVE BEEN FILED AWAY IN THE CLASSIFIED ANNALS OF PROJECT BLUE BOOK, THE AIR FORCE'S UFO INVESTIGATION AGENCY.

Transcribing the text in the document:

It takes again Uncontradicted by the newspaper accounts of it any more than has been done by those who try to explain it away as a meteor or a weather balloon. The simple fact is that the United States Air Force is unable to explain this observation even though their explanation is that it was a "weather balloon." A weather balloon does not appear like the object described in the report. It would be admitted if GRO had a way to be the truth.

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Air Force Systems Command newsletter called "NEWSREV" dated August 1962. The text on the page is focused on an article titled "Record X-15 Flight Brings White New" which describes a record-setting flight of the X-15 rocket-powered aircraft.

AUGUST 1962
Forging Military Speuepowst

Record X-15 Flight Brings White Now
Event At SC: O. Rssrt M. White, s..sd

X-16 pilot, set a "white" aaw record during a flight on July 17. He soared to an altitude of 59,430 feet, far exceeding the previous altitude record of 54,200 set by the same plane in a flight last May 16.

His more obvious accomplishments
Included bauting the record for the highest speed yet attained by an X-16: 3,538 miles per hour. He also achieved the longest time of powered flight in an X-15 - 11 minutes, 16 seconds. And, as it had before, his flight provided important data for the X-15 research and development program.

The mission, originally scheduled for July 18. was successful beyond all expectations on July 17. Major White's previous best mark of 54,200 feet, set on May 16, thereby became obsolete.

The historic flight elevated Major White to a new stature as a pilot, placing him in the forefront of today's space age developments.

After the flight, with an attitude of 59,430 feet, Major White was flown to Washington, D.C. where he was greeted by President John F. Kennedy on the afternoon of July 18. The President and Mrs. White posed for photographers on the White House lawn.

On the same day, President Kennedy signed an executive order awarding Major White the Distinguished Flying Cross for his achievement during the flight. The ceremony marked the first time that an X-15 pilot had been so honored.

During the time of peak excitement
around his flight, Major White exhibited an almost complete indifference to the publicity and honors showered upon him. He remained modest and calm amidst the turmoil, his thoughts seeming to be concentrated on the continuing X-15 program and the problems yet to be solved.

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report document. It contains a photograph of a man, presumably the subject of the report. The text in the image discusses the "Effects of Nuclear Weapons" and mentions President Kennedy's speech on the topic.

As an OCR system, I will now extract all the text from the document:

EDITORIAL

Effects Of Nuclear Weapons
One of the serious consequences of the U.S. atmospheric nuclear tests, as President Kennedy said last March, was to add to the burden of our military command capabilities. Our Air Force Command must operate effectively in a nuclear environment as our weapon systems must be capable of performing their mission, even when subjected to the residual effects of nuclear tests.
A clear understanding of nuclear effects is necessary to solutions of problems created as a result of the capability: hardening of our missile and aircraft, and to hardening of our country vehicles against enemy attack on our nation.
Certain steps are, of course, necessary to redress the Air Force Special Weapons Command problems. Recent investigations have found these steps are needed to overcome damages found where possible to find ways other than the actual testing, to pro vide the needed information.
The data accumulated in progress in finding new measures of effects data during the moratorium years. A great many theoretical investigations were conducted with the end in view of developing effects data as a low cost means of studying certain effects.
Many individuals of experiments, which were considered as small scale effects tests, have been conducted at the Center. The experiments, all have been minor, and have often used a combination of methods which appear to cover the requirements sufficiently, reducing the months to some as we begin operations in our new nuclear arena as impact through military and civil community to be less.
As we conclude certain phases of activity as President Kennedy said, "We are spending more money on military tools in the last year than we have in recent years, because our communicanons which enable our command and control centers to disintence a response; and because we must have the means of delivering these tools with electronic guidance systems to find their targets, and providing them with electronic guidance systems to find their targets, and providing them with electronic guidance systems to find their targets.
What we cannot be certain, how much of this turn out to be useless, blocked out, paralyzed or destroyed by the complex effects of nuclear explosions."
This year, Special Weapons Center's theoretical work and labor tories will help provide the certainty to qualify and support the Air Force programs required to harden our weapon systems and operate in the environment of a nuclear detonation, as Commander, AFSWC.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document discussing the role of the Senior NCO (Non-Commissioned Officer) Academy in building best enlisted leadership.

Building Best Enlisted Leadership
is Role of Senior NCO Academy

The text in the document is as follows:

Building Best Enlisted Leadership is Role of Senior NCO Academy
Since the Air Force officer training programs or education through the Senior NCO Academy have grad-uated thousands of officers, it is only natural that the enlisted leaders in the Air Force should be given particular attention. The NCO Academy located at Perrin AFB in Albuquerque, N.M., is an outstanding example of the leadership training given to the NCO.
At the NCO Academy, selected leaders are trained to handle their affairs and responsibilities as senior NCO who have a vital part of administering the Air Force. While all NCO's receive some professional training, the Academy is set aside to give in-depth instruction in administration, personnel, supply, operations training, and other technical and supervisory skills.  
Approximately 1,000 students are trained during the 12-week course offered each quarter by the academy. Students are chosen from among the senior NCO's with the best background of experience, leadership, and military knowledge. This course gives them the opportunity to broaden their knowledge and master skills for the benefit of the Air Force.
Physical fitness is an important part of Academy life. Each student must meet certain physical standards to enter the course and while undergoing training they are kept busy with drill, exercise, and sports. This program develops the physical condition necessary for NCO leadership.
The first class of 25 master sergeants entered the Academy in January 1957. Since then more than 5,200 senior NCO's have graduated. The Academy has been instrumental in providing the Air Force with its most outstanding and effective NCO leadership. Graduates are in demand worldwide and are assigned to key leadership positions in major commands. Upon graduation, they receive promotion to higher grades. The Academy program is considered so important that major commands are authorized to send promising NCO's to the Academy for training.

The image contains two photographs. One photograph shows a group of people, possibly students, engaged in some kind of physical activity or training. The other photograph shows a man in a suit, who appears to be receiving an award or recognition.

Text extracted from the document:

The NCO Academy fosters leadership, and collective security. This non-commissioned officer (NCO) institution provides advanced military training and administration. The physical facilities include a study desk, lamps, chairs, two chests of drawers, and automatic typing machines. Instruction covers all subjects needed for military administration and leadership.

Physical fitness is an important part of the training. The cadets engage in sports programs including basketball, football, volleyball, track and field, etc. They also participate in command post exercises during field training.

Qualifying cadets receive diplomas and are considered for entry into officer candidate schools. Many graduates go on to become commissioned officers and prove valuable to the Air Force. More than half of the instructors at the NCO Academy have been graduates of the school.

The image appears to be a page from a UFO report document. There is a photograph present in the image, which shows an older man with glasses and a mustache. The text below the photograph indicates that this is a portrait of Professor John E. Remaly Geo, who is described as the "chief scientist of research at the Project Blue Book group, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio."

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

"On Aug. 13 Major White wit a new shuttle recovered from desert which were "discovered" that day. Passed to the Prime Club for study. It appears small oval shape, metallic white, but faintly transparent as if plexiglass. He had become the first man to recover such material.

In Dec., 1960 he reached an altitude of 95,000 feet in the X-15 rocket, then known as the most exclusive club in Air Force history. There were 13 charter members.

On Aug. 13, 1962 he reached am altitude of 66,500 feet in the X-15, breaking the previous record set in 1961 by Joe Walker at 67,600 feet.

The X-15 project was a special Air Force program involving the U.S. space research program and the development of boost glide vehicles to travel at very high speeds and altitudes. The flight of Aug. 13, 1962 brought the space flight speed record to an average of 3,591.4 m.p.h. (5,600 k.p.h).

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing only text and no visual imagery.

The text of the document is as follows:

On Aug 19, Major White set a new altitude record of 26,390 feet in the XB-70A #3 which he developed. This marked the 28th test flight of the XB-70A aircraft.

On Aug 18, Capt Joseph Kittinger Jr. performed a record breaking feat when he made a balloon ascent to 102,800 feet, or 19.5 miles and descended to earth, landing in the New Mexico desert and destroyed a GB-47 drone aircraft.

The period of unprecedented unusual air activity began on Aug 15 when the XB 70A capsule was first made public. Two days later Capt Kittinger, a research project officer at the Aerospace Medical Division, Headquarters at Brooks Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas, made a record breaking jump. His 1960 parachute descent reached a peak speed of 614 mph, the highest speed ever attained by a human in free fall. His aerial acrobatics and plunge to earth were recorded on Nov 16, 1960.

The XLV capsule carried a 12-man test crew, including a captain, six lieutenants, four airmen, and the commanding officer, a colonel. After landing, the capsule was deemed acceptable for astronaut training. Members of Captain Mitchell's "military team" were present at the test to greet the capsule and crew on their return to earth.

Major and Mrs. Robert A. White, who had gained national fame as the first man to fly the X-15 rocket aircraft, maintained a keen interest in Kittinger's venture. Prior to the jumping, Col. John P. Stapp and Dr. Paul A. Campbell examined Kittinger and pronounced him fit for the historic leap.

Sgt. Airman Howard, Sgt. Airman Herman, and Sgt. Airman Bard were recognized as AMC crew members who assisted in the mission. selected General Schriever presented Sgt Howell with a Citation and Silver Star on April 27, 1961 for his part in the record breaking jump.

The fifth and final of these record-setting events occurred for Colonel Robert M. White on June 9, 1961. He was the first man to fly more than 4,000 mph, setting a new speed record for manned aircraft. The Air Force termed his flight "the greatest single advancement in manned flight since the Wright Brothers".

Patrick AFB Solves Problem
Of Holiday Road Hazards

Plan for safer driving during Labor Day weekend and prevent traffic fatalities is announced by Patrick AFB commander. Whether it's a trip to the beach for a weekend or fishing, or a visit to relatives, the three-day Labor Day weekend poses a real threat during the weekend.

The increased traffic, fatigue, and bad driving habits can all add up to a deadly weekend. To lessen this potential, Patrick AFB has initiated a plan to get assigned personnel an organized recreational program.

A plan to get a selected personnel an organized recreation program was announced by Patrick AFB commander. Many employees and their families participate in activities like deep sea fishing, boating, picnicking, and softball to provide a full day of planned activities.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing text describing an experiment related to "Man's 'Pressurability' Tested in Sealed Capsule Experiments".

The text in the document is as follows:

OPERATIONS

Man's 'Pressurability' Tested in Sealed Capsule Experiments

What is the optimum atmospheric composition and pressure necessary for man's respiratory intake and emission are questions being studied in sealed capsule experiments.

The cell is a fabric structure built for three hours to test the effects of varying atmospheric pressures and compositions on the human subject. During these tests, both chambers are pressurized to prescribed limits. The test cell differs only one-half pound of pressure from the external ambient pressure. Aircraft engineers said the purpose was to determine if man can operate in an environment of reduced pressure and see what happens.

The project is part of the 6570th Aerospace Medical Research Laboratories at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. They are concerned with the human limitations of operation in space and other extreme environments.

During testing, both chambers are pressurized to prescribed points. The optimum gaseous atmosphere necessary for the subject's respiratory intake and emission is being studied, along with the effect of various pressure levels.

AF Academy To Get Basic Research Lab

The 3800th Air Police squadron, at the Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, will receive a basic research laboratory. This facility will serve as the primary research laboratory of the School of Aerospace Science. Major research areas will be related to the establishment of a "space laboratory" in support of the training programs.

The construction of the new facility will be accomplished during the current fiscal year, and laboratory equipment valued at over $1 million will be installed. It will provide housing and support for selected members of the Aerospace Research Laboratories including scientists and researchers. The laboratory will be under the direct technical supervision of the School of Aerospace Science.

Martin-Denver Gets Algae Research Lab

The Air Force has awarded the Martin-Denver Division a $1.6 million contract for the establishment of a research facility devoted to the research and development of algae products which conceivably would have military applications. The new laboratory will be located at Denver, Colorado, and will be manned by scientific personnel of the Martin-Denver Division.

The contract provides for the procurement of equipment, facilities, and technical personnel to conduct a complete research and development program relating to the cultivation, processing, and utilization of various algae. Work will be supervised by Dr. G. D. Cliff, Director of the Martin-Denver Biotechnology Center.

Cancer Detection
Seen As By-Product Of
Research In Human Speech

A diagnostic technique which may well lead to the effective detection of early stages of certain types of cancer was recently developed from current research into the anatomy of human speech.

This work has a relationship to medical diagnosis which may prove unexpectedly valuable. Though the research was originally designed to advance basic scientific knowledge of the speech process, it has resuited in the discovery of a pattern of voice characteristics that appears to reveal physiological abnormalities in the human vocal system.

In pursuing his investigations of the mechanism of speech, the scientist involved, Dr. R. L. Miller of Bell Telephone Laboratories, observed that distinct variations in the sound quality of a person's voice seem to be related to specific anatomical changes in the structures involved in speech production. Analysis of high-quality tape recordings of various individuals speaking has enabled Dr. Miller to define a number of voice parameters that are affected by structural changes in the larynx, throat and other speech organs.

This research has led to the belief that deviations from the normal patterns of these voice parameters may provide a practical means of detecting early physiological changes associated with the onset of certain types of cancer in the areas involved in speech. If this relationship can be fully established, it could result in a new and valuable diagnostic tool for the early detection of cancer.

The implications of this work have not gone unnoticed in the medical world. Officials of the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society have expressed keen interest in the possible applications of this speech research for cancer detection. Further joint investigations to explore these possibilities are now underway.

The image shows text about various topics such as an "Air Academy to Get Basic Research Lab", "RADC Man Gives New Solution for Radio Puzzler", "Cancer Detection Seen As By-Product Of Research In Human Senses", and other related information. I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document.

AF Academy To Get
Basic Research Lab
The Air Force will establish a basic
research laboratory at the Air Force
Academy near Colorado Springs, Col
orado. The aim of the new facility, a
part of the Academy's research pro
gram, will be the first time such a
high-ranking research center has been
located at a military installation.
The new laboratory will serve a dual
purpose. It will conduct basic research
in the physical sciences and will train
cadet officers in research techniques-a
means for teaching future Air Force
Academy graduates and commissioned
officers to better understand and con
duct research programs.
Selected members of the Academy
staff will be assigned to the new re
search facility as part of their normal
duties in order to better integrate this
research effort with the overall Acad-
emy educational program.

RADC Man Gives
New Solution for
Radio Puzzler
A trans-horizon radio propagation
phenomenon providing highly pre
dictable patterns in certain frequency
ranges has been discovered by a Re
search and Development Command
scientist, Dr. Drenner H. Ring, and pre
sented in a paper to the Institute of
Radio Engineers.
The new solution dispenses with the
complex mathematical analysis usually
required to explain this type of propa
gation and has proven highly accurate
in practical application by radar scien
tists.
The trans-horizon propagation pat
terns discovered by Dr. Ring were pre
viously unexplained. The effects have
been observed and reported since 1947
but a satisfactory analysis has not been
presented until now.
Dr. Ring's solution has been applied
to radar propagation problems with
startling accuracy. It is expected to find
wide application in communications as
well as radar when fully developed.

Cancer Detection
Seen As By-Product
Of Research In Human Senses
A diagnostic technique which may
lead to the effective detection of cancer
in its early stages is seen as a by-product
of research now underway at the Aero
medical Laboratory.
Part of the Laboratory's long range
study into the auditory and visual
senses, the current research involves a
detailed examination of the "attack
time" inherent in the human organism's
responses to stimuli. Initial studies in
dicated that the reaction time, or "at
tack time", of a person's auditory and
visual responses reflected a definite
change when certain forms of cancer
were present.
While the Laboratory's basic interest
is still directed toward a greater under
standing of the human senses, the pos
sibility of this technique aiding in cancer
detection is now being explored. Tests
were made which indicated the "attack
time" of responses from a person who
already had cancer showed a measur
able change from the "attack time" of a
person without cancer.
The technique, called the "Auditory
Response Time Analysis", could lead to
a non-invasive, simple procedure to aid
early diagnosis of some forms of can
cer. It may also provide a more sensitive
indicator for the study of the effects of
cancer and other diseases on the human
organism's sensory functions.

Man-Denver Gets
Algae Research Lab
The Air Force has awarded the Mar
tin-Denver Division a $140,000 contract
to establish a research facility at the
Denver Division plant to study the cul
tivation and uses of algae.
The contract provides for the pro
duction, cultivation and distribution of
various strains of microalgae for re
search and development purposes.
The Air Force feels that algae may
provide a fruitful field for the fabrica
tion of lightweight, compact and versa
tile devices which someday would be
highly useful in aerospace operations.
The facility will be located at the
University of Colorado's School of
Medicine, Denver Division.

Special Acts Award
Yellow Springs engineer, Robert
Colbert, of the Aerospace R&D Labor
atory at Wright-Patterson AFB, re
ceived a special acts award presented
to him by the Dayton Laboratories Di
rector, Dr. J.H. Hough.
The citation carries a cash award of
$600 and recognizes the outstanding
efforts and contributions by Mr. Colbert
to the Laboratory's work.
For many months, Colbert worked
evenings and weekends, conducting
studies and analyses for the R&D Lab
oratory on certain radar propagation
techniques.
When difficulties arose in negotiating
contracts that were impeding the prog
ress of the laboratory's research, he
took it upon himself, on his own initia
tive, to personally contact firms and
negotiate the contracts. His self-initiated
efforts were a distinct contribution to
the program.
Command officials felt that the un
usual diligence, ingenuity and technical
competence displayed by Colbert in
these activities warranted the special
recognition.

TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT IN THE DOCUMENT:

Great Pains Taken To 'Prep' Man-Orbiting Atlas Boosters

When Col. Walter M. Schirra lifts off in the Mercury capsule this October, he will be boosted into space by an Atlas booster that has undergone a grueling series of preparatory tests and preparation in order to be ready for this critical mission. The unique Mercury capsule will be boosted by a special modified version of the Atlas, the Atlas D, which is being readied for this mission under the watchful eye of the AFSWC Scouting Group.

Such a shakedown is necessary to assure that the Atlas booster, which must perform flawlessly, is properly prepared and checked out in every detail before the big day. The Air Force's intense preparations and the multi-thousand component tests that make an Atlas booster the world's most complex device, are described in this article.

"The Air Force's intensive and extensive testing program for the Atlas booster for the Mercury program has paid off and enabled us to improve the reliability of the Atlas booster to a high degree," Colonel Brundage, systems manager for the Atlas booster program, stated. "This has resulted in an Atlas booster that is more reliable and dependable than it has ever been in the past."

American astronauts know that the Atlas booster, on which they must place their lives, must perform flawlessly. An Atlas booster must be able to boost the 3,000-pound Mercury spacecraft from earth to an altitude of 100 miles, and then separate cleanly and accurately so that the spacecraft can continue its flight into orbit. Any Atlas booster malfunction, even a relatively minor one, could prove disastrous.

"That's the reason for this intensive testing program," Colonel Brundage pointed out. "We want to take advantage of our ability to thoroughly checkout and test the Atlas booster in advance. This intensive and extensive ICBM testing enables us to pinpoint and correct any potential malfunctions or shortcomings before the actual manned shot."

The extensive ground checkout, including literally thousands of individual tests, means that the Atlas booster for the Mercury shot not only takes twice as many man-hours to prepare for launching as a standard ICBM, but also requires special procedures to assure perfect performance. Hundreds of special checkouts, ranging from close scrutiny of every electrical connection to dynamic balance and vibration tests, are performed on the Atlas.

"We don't take any chances," the Colonel stated flatly. "The Mercury astronaut's life is at stake, and we intend to make that Atlas booster as nearly perfect as it can possibly be before we light the fuse."

This intensive preparation even extends to the manufacturing process. Parts that are marginal or questionable in any way are ruthlessly discarded. Only the most perfect components go into that special Mercury-rated Atlas.

The text discusses the goals and activities of the conference, which included presentations by the Aeromedical Research Laboratory, the Armament Research and Engineering Division, the Test Pilot School, and the Special Weapons Center. The text also mentions the attendance of "outstanding New Mexico high school science and mathematics teachers" at the conference.

AFSWHC Scouting Group. State Agencies Join For Science Aerospace Education Conference

Three hundred outstanding New Mexico high school science and mathematics teachers were special guests of the AFSWHC Scouting Group of the Air Force Special Weapons Center, Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, at a conference on aerospace education conducted 3-8 April 1961.

The conference began with keynote addresses by Dr. Emile Zuckerkandl, Chief, Aeromedical Research Laboratory, Aerospace Medical Division, and Dr. H.C. Alexander, Chief, Armament Research and Engineering Division, AFSWC. They covered scientific and technical aspects of the space program and the Air Force mission in space research. 

Later in the week, the group visited the Test Pilot School, the Special Weapons Center, and other facilities which were the subjects of presentations by key military and civilian speakers. The program was designed to acquaint the teachers with the latest developments in aerospace science and technology, and to motivate them to incorporate aerospace themes into their regular school curricula.

The conference was climaxed by a banquet and an address by Mai. Gen. Wendell Kelley, commanding, AFSWC. General Kelley stressed that education is the key to the future of our nation's space program. He pointed out the need for competent scientists, engineers, and technicians to staff the ever-increasing number of jobs created by the expanding space program.

The AFSWHC Scouting Group is the education arm of the Special Weapons Center, which is the Air Force's principal laboratory for research and development of special weapons and associated equipment. The group conducts numerous educational programs and field trips throughout the state which are the highlights of the science curricula in many New Mexico high schools.

MANAGEMENT

Second Air Symposium On Bionics
To Be Held In Dayton Next Year

The United States Air Force sponsored by
the School of Aviation Medicine, Aerospace
Medical Division, the Office of Research Analyses, Air Research and Development Command, and the Wright Air Development Division, Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, May 21-23, 1962, a Symposium on Bionics. Participants included members of the Aerospace Medical Division, the Institute of the Aerospace Sciences, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and representatives from universities, foundations and government agencies.

Bionics is a relatively new, and rapidly advancing science since its introduction in the late 1950's. A new area of inter-disciplinary research, bionics seeks to apply the principles and mechanisms observed in biological systems to engineering problems. This knowledge derived from the study of biological systems is applied to produce new devices, components, and systems.

APGC Closes An Era
With Last OF-60's Flight

An area closed at Air Proving Ground
Center recently when the last OF-60
target drone being flown over the
Little Gulf was scheduled to land. The
last OF-60 flight was made on March 29.

The first and final OF-60 drone
flights were made in 1957 and 1962
with Col. Ralph W. Crissey and Capt. Owen C. Daris, Jr.
conducting the OF-60 from the Little
Gulf Operation area at Eglin AFB.

The drone was retrieved and returned
to the team of Camarata, May, and Igo,
who were responsible for the OF-60
program at the Armament Test Division.
AF and MAC officials were on hand
when the last OF-60 drone was landed
on April 5, 1962. This last vehicle is
now stored at the APGC as a museum

BID LET TO DEVELOP 
WEATHER-SAFE SYSTEM
The Aerospace Vehicle Control Division of the Air Force Systems Command is developing a compact air traffic control system that will permit aircraft to land safely regardless of weather conditions.
Under the direction of Major Phillip C. Gerber, the Division is spearheading a three-year project to add automatic landing gear to the STOL (short take-off and landing) aircraft being developed for the Air Force. 
The system will allow pilots to land their planes automatically with a 20-foot visibility ceiling, bringing a new era of all-weather flight to the Air Force.
Dyna-Soar
The X-20 Dyna-Soar, the Air Force's manned spacecraft, will be able to carry 3,000 pounds of non-military equipment to altitudes of 300 miles along a 17,500 mile-per-hour trajectory.
The X-20 is being developed by Aeronautical Systems Division for the Air Force. Current plans are for the X-20 to make its first un-manned flight from Cape Kennedy in 1963, with the first manned flight coming in 1964.
The X-20 is being developed as a research vehicle, designed to test systems that will be used later in the development of an Air Force manned space system. The basic X-20 design is being used as the basis for a new vehicle being developed by Aeronautical Systems Division.

AFSC BRIEFS  
New Name
Aerospace Medical Division's School of Aerospace Medicine recently changed its name to School of Aerospace Medicine, effective July 1. Location of the school is un-changed--Brooks AFB, Texas.

Serial Numbers
A new system of serially numbering personnel, equipment, and supplies of the Air Force is being developed. This system will provide a means of easily identifying equipment, supplies, and members of the armed forces. Under the new system, each piece of equipment and supply item will have a serial number, and each individual will have a serial number and a service number. Supplies and equipment will be more easily controlled, and personnel records easily traced.
Self Defense
Students now enrolled in the Squadron Officer School at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, are receiving a new course in self-defense. The course, called the Colt Self-Defense course, was introduced to the class which started last month. Training includes judo, karate, and other methods of self-defense.

Silver Wings
To act as an incentive for career advancement, a total of 59 cadets training through the Air Force ROTC program at colleges and universities have been awarded the silver wings of a pilot. Awarded to those AFROTC cadets who complete the pilot training course and qualify for their wings, this program is part of the Air Force's plan to bring the best qualified personnel into the air force.

Face-Lifting To Add
Radar Tracking Power
The Air Proving Ground Center will build a major addition to the APGC radar tracking range near Pensacola, Florida, it was recently announced. To be constructed at a cost of $2.6 million, the new facilities will provide an electronic "face-lifting" to the already-extensive radar tracking range.
Among the new additions will be a peak power capability of 2.5 megawatts and the installation of electronically-steerable, phased-array radars. These super-radars will enable the testing and evaluation of the latest air-to-air and air-to-ground guided missile systems under operational conditions.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

War College Associate Courses At
ASD Termed Highly Successful
The Air Force recently announced that
the Associate Course in Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD) at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, is going on and has been termed highly successful by the Air Force. This course is designed to provide education for key civilian personnel and military officers in the Air Force. 

A voluntary program, the new associate
course was established in September 1961 and has been receiving enthusiastic endorsement and support from employees of the Air Force. The course is providing a means for personnel to become better acquainted with the Air Force, its mission and functions. This cooperative effort is considered an important step in bringing the Air Force and civilian communities closer together.

The War College associate course is based on the same curriculum as the regular Air War College course at Maxwell AFB, Alabama. The purpose is to train civilian and military personnel in order to improve their capabilities in analysis and decision making, and to prepare them to be presented as candidates for key positions in the Air Force. 

Upon finishing the course, students
are given a certificate of a completion of a three-month study program.

Lt. Nicolas Graduates
SOS With Distinction 
Lieutenant Roland R. Nicolas, of
A&EE, ASD, who is an aeronautical engin-
eering and analysis planner, was honored
recently upon graduation from the Air Command and Staff School (SOS) at Maxwell AFB, Ala. Lieutenant Nicolas was one of 30 students graduating with distinction.

Lieutenant Nicolas was born in Lebanon. He attended the University of Beirut from which he received his bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering in 1957. After coming to the United States, he attended the University of Alabama where he received his master's degree in aeronautical engineering in June 1959. He then joined ASD in August 1959. He attended the SOS course from August 1961 to June 1962. Upon his return to ASD, Lieutenant Nicolas was assigned to the Engineering Design Branch. In this assignment, he conducts studies of automatic and semi-automatic flight control systems for aircraft.

Lt. Gen. Reuben C. Hood, Jr., commander of AFSC, and Maj. Gen. W. A. Davis, former commander of ASD, awarded Lieutenant Nicolas the SOS graduation certificate.

Contract To Develop Deep
Space Tracking Ability
Announced By Air Force

The Air Force has announced a multi-
million dollar contract with the Philco
Corp oration of Ame rica, Radio-
Electronics-Television Manufacturers As-
sociation, Philadelphia, to develop a capa-
bility for deep space tracking. This effort
is part of the presently underway program
aimed at setting up an Advanced Space
Tracking Facility.
Besides a powerful telescope, the
equipment under this contract will in-
clude a large radio telescope and instru-
mentation to provide a capability for
precision tracking to a far greater range
than presently exists. The contract calls
for the development and installation of the
necessary equipment and the training of
personnel to operate the new facility.
This message and more: The remarkable
development of satellite tracking and con-
trol capabilities so vital to the national
defense are described. With accuracy as
high as can be achieved, electronically, then the
information gathered and the messages trans-
mitted to the earth from the satellite can then
be used for further improvement in the design
and development of future satellites.
However, this advanced capability cannot be
placed in the hands of unqualified personnel and
necessarily be restricted to earth.

Inventory Transfers Net
Millions For Taxpayers

This report of activities of the Defense
Supply Agency indicates the extent to which
millions of dollars in inventory values are
being transferred to appropriate Government
agencies and to private industry. Under this
recurrent process of inventory adjustments,
excess stocks from one service is another
service's deficit. This represents an
economy and a better utilization of
resources according to a report made to the
Defense Supply Agency by its Director of
Supply Operations.
A sample of how the "transfers"
were handled is noted. The Navy had a
quantity of turbine engines used in aircraft
which were not required. Through coordina-
tion with the Air Force, the entire quantity
could be absorbed. This prevented the
ultimate dis position of these items and
provided supplies which the Air Force had
indicated as a need.
This practice was described by
authorities for Defense as "one of the
advantages of having a central inventory
system." Under this system, the services
do not have to resort to sales or scrapping
excess items, but can keep them in the
Defense supply system for further use.

Education Pays
Col. D. Simmons, of ASD, a supervisor
assigned to Armament Munitions and
Electronics Division, attended the United
States Air Force English Test Center. Upon
the successful completion of the course of
studies, he was awarded a Master's degree.
This award of the advanced degree, under an
Air Force educational program for enlisted
and officer personnel, is indicative of the
many opportunities for education and train-
ing in the Armed Forces.
Some of the examples that further demon-
strate the Air Force interests and invest-
ments in the education of its personnel:
The U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology
located near Wright-Patterson AFB, provides
graduate degree programs in various techni-
cal fields.
The Air University at Maxwell AFB, Ala.,
furnishes non-technical graduate programs
in administration, management, and
International Affairs.
The Air Force has tuition payment programs
for officers and airmen taking college courses
at local institutions under their own time and
resources.

Rocket Society Speaker

Harry G. Bean, the 1956 President of the
American Rocket Society, recently addressed
the Northern Ohio National Meeting of the
Armed Forces Communications and Elec-
tronics Association. He spoke on the contribution
of this society to the advancement of rocketry,
and the technical problems it has tackled. He
pointed out that rockets already being flight-
tested are not only capable of orbiting a
satellite, but are also powerful enough to
send a manned spacecraft to the Moon.
Allen D. Schoenfeld, the current President
of the American Rocket Society, stated that
the steady progress being made by the
society will provide the technical advances
needed to achieve manned inter-planetary
flight in the near future, and support systems
for the over-all space program.

And AF Aid
to Academic Top
There is currently talk of an academic
program under which the Air Force service
will assist in advanced education leading to
the Ph. D. degree, This new Program is sini
lar to the doctors' program which was in
effect during World War II in that industry
would permit their doctor employees to
attend graduate schools at government expense.
At the present time the AF is hard pressed
to secure doctors, technicians, and other pro
fessional talent for its service so that the
proposed program appears to be a logical
solution.
Lt. colonel Robert J. Kauffmann, chief of
the program, indicates that the Air Force is
presently in the research planning stage of
this program. He believes that in time, perhaps
one year or more from now, the program will
be announced in detail and will become oper
ational. It is felt that this plan would help se
cure the services of recent Ph.D. graduates to
augment the present AF scientific talent.

he received in 1953. His work on the PL pro
gram is a follow-up of a previous assignment
of an aerospace medical nature.

Patrick Alman Has
Own Scholarship Plan
Patrick AYB recently announced the
establishment of a scholarship program
which is new and unique, This pro
gram, known as the "Patrick Plan," is
open to all high school seniors and is
aimed at the outstanding senior of each
high school in the United States.
Under this plan, one scholarship award,
valued at $1,000 per year, will be given each
year to the outstanding senior of each high
school in the nation. The award entitles the
recipient to four years of college education
at the school of his choice, majoring in any
of the aeronautical or scientific fields.
The purpose of the "Patrick Plan" is to
give the wards of this scholarship financial
aid in the furtherance of their education and
the advancement of an aeronautical and
scientific career. It is felt that this program
will do much to upgrade the quality of
students entering the AF and thus help with
the critical shortage of trained personnel.
In announcing the plan, it was pointed out
that recipients of the award, if they meet the
required qualifications, may be offered
immediate commissions in the Air Force.
There is a move on to increase the num
ber of scholarships under this plan.

AFSW Major "Brushes Up"
On His Artistic Talents
It seems that during his free time, AFSWC
Major Robert V. Bush, an electronics techni
cian, has been devoting a good deal of his
attention to the development of his artistic
talents which he hopes will lead to an avoca
tion. The major, who is assigned to duties at
AFSWC, White Sands Missile Range, N.M.,
has already demonstrated an impressive abili
ty as a painter.
This artistic talent, which he hopes will help
round out an otherwise technical career, is
being encouraged and developed by the AFSWC
command. Me sow holds art shows of his
work and has done portraits of fellow officers
as well as scenes of missile and rocket fir-
i11ga. Ris work shows an ability to capture in
oil the many and varied landscapes of the
New Mexico area.
The major took up painting only a couple
of years ago as a hobby, but his work has
already won high praise from art critics and
his fellow officers. The AFSWC command be
lieves that this type of avocational interest may
help to retain officers and airmen by providing
a means of relaxation and self-expression.

ASD Research Scientist
Earns Engineering PhD
Doctor Wayne E. Nelson, a research scientist
in the Aeronautical Systems Division's Aero Propulsion
Laboratory, has recently earned the degree of Doctor
of Philosophy in Mechanical Engineering from the
Ohio State University. 
Nelson joined the Air Force in 1954. After serving
a brief tour at Wright-Patterson, he was assigned to
the Air Propulsion Laboratory where he has been
conducting research and development work in ad-
vanced propulsion systems.
Completion of his doctorate, after many years of
part-time study, represents an important milestone
in Nelson's career as an ASD research scientist.
His dissertation was in the field of applied mechanics
dealing with problems in stress analysis of turbine
blades and other rotating components. This research
will be directly applicable to the development of
more efficient and reliable jet engines.
Nelson and his wife, Mary, and their two children
reside in Beavercreek, Ohio.

Bootstrap Captain One Of 22 At Eglin Advanced R & D Center
by Miss Lucas

Kentucky farmer to space man - Capt. Kenneth L. Behney! From his humble beginnings as a Kentucky farm boy, he has now become an associate project engineer on the Proving Ground Center's experimental research program. He is now a staff officer in the Air Force and operates at Eglin AFB, Florida.
He started out in the Air Force as an enlisted man shortly after graduating from high school. It was at this time that his fascination for the wonders of space and science was first aroused. Among those fascinated was Capt. Kenneth L. Behney who is now one of the 22 bootstrap captains enrolled. It was so successful that other students are now waiting to enter this unique program.

Up-East "Hillbilly" Adds To His Fame On Florida Radio-TV

Airmen William "Billy" W. Cole, a recent addition to the Air Force's "Up-East Hillbilly" radio and TV programs, has won fame as an actor in television since his high school days. His rich, deep voice has won him some honors, including eight AFSC talent contest finals in 1961 and second place in the AFSC talent contest finals.
Much of Bill's music is original, and he has been featured by professional singers on TV shows such as Don Gibson, Cuz Wilburn and Grandpa Jones. His humorous TV personality is in the nation's spotlight now, and he has played most of the clubs in Georgia, Alabama, and North Carolina. One song he wrote and sang called the "Jet Springs" has appeared in the Air Force Times and Air Defense Command Review.
Peter Glannini, a computer programmer with the Command, has perfected a computer technique on a computer which calculates and analyzes AFSC talent contest finals in 1961 and next year's contest. This has permitted the Command to establish objective criteria for the talent contests and to run them more efficiently. Peter's duties didn't stop here - he made the first statistical analysis of the winners and put out a booklet on this data.

ECMR Employee Given Top Award
For Work In Scouting Activities

Charles R. Johnson of Windsor Locks, Conn., has been given national recognition for his outstanding service to the Boy Scouts of America over the past 20 years. The highest award any Boy Scout can receive for outstanding service, the Silver Beaver Award, has been presented to him.

Johnson has devoted much of his time to participating in and supervising various activities of the Boy Scouts. He has served as assistant scoutmaster, scoutmaster, district commissioner, and chairman of the Naugatuck District of Connecticut Yankee Council. He has also participated in the health and safety program of the Boy Scouts.

The whole family is interested in outdoor activities and their son is a Boy Scout and their daughter is a Girl Scout. Johnson believes that scouting is a fine way for young people to learn how to use their leisure time and how to work with others. He thinks it is important that the adults in a community take an active part in these youth organizations.

ASD Man Earns Award
For LIS Systems Work

Robert W. Mansfield of the Directorate of Organizational Support Programs, Aeronautical Systems Division, recently received the Outstanding Achievement Award. The award was presented to him for his contributions in the field of Library Information System (LIS) management.

Mansfield's work in the LIS field is described as "outstanding." He is credited with serving as one of two representatives to attend national and international meetings dealing with library and information systems problems. As a result of his participation on these committees, new systems and procedures have been recommended for adoption within the LIS community.

At the conclusion of the meetings, Mansfield was commended by the USAF Surgeon General and the Director of Libraries, United States Army, for his outstanding contributions to national library programs.

Mansfield has been serving as Chief of the LIS Systems Branch at ASD since 1944. He was instrumental in the development and implementation of several major improvements in the ASD LIS system.

Patrick Officer Cited
For Authoring Books
On Space Capability
Lieutenant Colonel Patrick J. Maginnis,
formerly assigned to the Office of the
Deputy Chief of Staff/Operations, Hq.
USAF, was recently commended in a
special letter from the Commanding
General of the AFSC for his extensive
writing and publication of books on
space capability.
Lieutenant Maginnis was nominated
for the Senior Officer Award "for his
outstanding contribution to the acquisi-
tion of knowledge and development of
skills directed toward the accomplish-
ment of USAF mission" as set forth in
AFSC Regulation 900-2.
The book, entitled "Flying Carpet"
deals with the Air Force's "man-in-
space" program. Another of his books,
"Manned Space Flight", has been ac-
claimed for its clarity and use in edu-
cating Air Force personnel and the gen-
eral public on the nation's efforts in the
space field.
The book was described as "extremely
creative and suggestive" in its presen-
tation of technical data. The AFSC let-
ter stated that the Lieutenant Colonel's
publications had been influential in the
acquisition of knowledge and develop-
ment of skills directed toward the ac-
complishment of the USAF mission.
RADC Wins Safety Award
Safety Plague, one of its highest flying
safety awards, to Horne Air Develop-
ment Center for outstanding safety
record. The RADC safety record from
July 1, 1961 through June 30, 1962 was
accident free flying hours. The safety
achievement reflects excellent accident
prevention operations, which includes
such items as KC-135, B-57 training, C-47
service tests, and missile and aircraft
instrumentation development.

Four Commands Cited
For Savings Program
As 'Money Tree' Ends
The "Money Tree" savings program at
Hq. Air Force Logistics Command and
Hq. Supply Air Force was ended July 13 by Gen. Orme L.
Wilson Jr., AFLC commander. Gen. Wilson said the program
had produced savings of $13 million in a year, adding "That's a
pretty good crop - and what I call a real 'Money Tree.'" 
Maj. Gen. Mark E. Bradley was awarded the Dis-
tinguished Serrice Medal for his efforts in devising and
administering the 'Money Tree' program at AFLC. The
certificate cites his "outstanding performance in conceiving and
implementing an Air Force maintenance and supply management
plan designated as the 'Money Tree.'"
The Strategic Air Command, Air De-
fense Command, Air Training Command and the Military Air
Transport Service were also cited for their economies and cost-
saving efforts.
The net savings to the Air Force
from the "Money Tree" program was over $13 million in the first
fiscal year it was in operation. This was a major factor in the
Air Force being able to absorb an unbudgeted increase of 7,700
personnel authorized July 1, 1961 without requesting additional
funds.
While the immediate savings were
dramatic in relieving the strain on the Air Force budget, the
far-reaching effects are considered of equal if not greater
importance. These include improved work simplification,
increased efficiency, and simplification of procedures.
The concepts and techniques of the
"Money Tree" program are applicable to all areas of Government
operation. A similar project put into effect by the Department
of Defense is the "Management Incentive Program" which was
instituted to grant cash management improvement awards.

Air Force Commandos
To Help Train Allies
An aerial training program under way at Hurlburt
Field, Fla., for the Air Force special air warfare
center, is training foreign military personnel in techniques
peculiar to the counterinsurgency role of the Air
Force. The Commandos are not designed actively to
engace the enemy but to train foreign allied air forces
in basic air combat, transportation, logistics and related
techniques of special counterinsurgency warfare essential
to low level group and surprise air
support missions and civic action programs.
All foreign military personnel and air
commandos are alike. The goal is to form
highly integrated and flexible
air-ground teams capable of operations ranging
from large scale campaigns to small
strike-team actions. The Air Force commandos will help
train counterparts of foreign allied forces in special
counterinsurgency warfare.

AIR FORCE COMMANDOS
TO HELP train allies
The newly activated Air Force Commando units, pioneers of unconventional warfare, have been given a new mission--to help train allies, especially South Vietnamese troops, and to assist free world military forces in guerrilla and pacification activities.
This new mission, which will continue the earlier air support and tactical air strike capability of the Commandos, is aimed at providing free world forces with maximum flexibility, mobility and firepower in the struggle against Communism. The Commandos' role will be to provide mobile training teams and operational assistance to friendly nations in selected areas.
The Commando units, originally organized in the late 1950's for special air operations, have been greatly enlarged and strengthened since then. Now numbers of trained personnel, special equipment and aircraft are available for intensified training and advisory missions to assist our allies. This expanded force will provide valuable support and capability not only to South Vietnam but to other free world nations as well.

57 Lady Volunteers Lauded For Hospital Red Cross Service
Closing and recognition ceremonies for Red Cross volunteers in the TRACY Hospital Tacoma were recently held. 36 women received honor certificates and 36 ware presented with service pins for the completion of their training period. Among those honored were five members of the Lakewood Elks Lodge, Mrs. John W. Humphrey, Mrs. Frederick E. Breen, Mrs. James A. Doke, Mrs. John W. Wilcox and Mrs. Paul Rapp.

VA Child Benefit Acts Available
The VA administra-tion has pointed out that many children and their parents are unaware of the beneficial provisions available under the VA children's program. These include vocational and educational assistance, compensation payments, and other benefits. While the general public may be familiar with VA compensation and pension pay-ments, the more comprehensive children's program services are not so widely known.

The VA says it will be glad to spell out the particulars of this program to any child or parent who wishes to inquire about it. Regardless of whether a veteran is living or deceased, his children may have earned the right to many allowances and services.

THE ECONOMY  
Process of Education 
Asian Tensions Remain - and are to some degree already set on the road to expansion despite the obstacles out of the way, according an idea that the U.S. might be on the brink economies if certain factors were not changed for the better. At least the President Kennedy gave them evidence to show that he is trying a new tack on this matter, encouraging thaw in cold war.

Joe Walker (Time, May 4) writes "While the President was speaking, the Republican leaders in Congress were presenting their three children to the White House photographers. Recalls White House pictures showing the President's young daughter and son, there seemed to impress the country that President cares about youth and health of its future citizens. There is an instant reaction, before any policy is announced, which serves to crystallize whatever mood is in the air."

While spent 3+ months in New prison camp (P.O.W. in Korea) and on return and testimony before Congressional committees (on Communist propaganda broadcasting than the Korean War itself), came into focus the tremendous cost of such prisons and the great effort to reprogram a human mind. Since 1958, Whitmer has been engaged in related research.

This page from a Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be text-only, describing the "Glenn Effect" seen in 1954, which was an observation made by rocket researchers of strange phenomena during the flight of rockets.

The text reads as follows:

GLENN EFFECT SEEN IN 1954

New evidence from stereo pictures taken by rocket eight years ago had been reported on by Hilary Sholto-Douglas in S r.TLv'CE News Letter for May 26, 1962.

A ROCKET that was fired by the U.S. Air Force eight years ago showed strange phenomena as it rose into the sky at night from Edwards Air Force Base in California. The rocket, released in 1954, showed glowing effects surrounding the rocket as it rose into the darkness. The glowing effects, according to the report, lasted for several minutes and appeared to be emanating from the rocket itself.

The phenomenon was named the "Glenn effect" after Major John H. Glenn, the first American astronaut to orbit the Earth, who helped gather data on the rocket experiments conducted in 1954.

The photogiraphs of the phenomena, which were taken during the rocket firing, were studied by scientists who concluded that the glowing effects were not caused by any known effects of rocket firing. They believe that the strange glowing was produced by the rocket itself in some as yet unexplained manner.

The report indicates that the photographs were carefully examined and the conclusion was reached that the glowing could not be attributed to any known causes connected with the firing of the rocket. There were no wires or other devices attached to the rocket that could have caused the glowing.

The report noted that the phenomenon was repeated in subsequent rocket firings and was observed by many witnesses on the ground. Whatever the cause, the strange glowing effect surrounding the rocket as it rose into the darkness continues to be a mystery.

The text in the document is as follows:

Space Changes Heredity
Changes in heredity of organisms may be induced through cosmic radiation, electrical and magnetic fields, and other environmental factors associated with space flight. These changes could have profound effects upon the earth's ecology and human race.

Explore Solar Flares
A space shutter photograph of a large solar flare which occurred on June 8, 1962 has been obtained. This flare was among the most intense ever observed. Such flares can have significant effects on communications and electric power systems on earth. Flares also produce intense radiation which can be hazardous to astronauts.

Mexico Quake Largest Since Disaster in 1957
The 1 July 1962 earthquake centered off the Pacific coast of southern Mexico was one of the largest in that region in 5 years. It caused extensive damage and loss of life.

The image contains a photograph depicting the head and upper body of a human figure. The figure appears to be wearing some type of headgear or helmet. The photograph is accompanied by the title "John Glenn and His Day of Miracles" and a caption that describes the moment as "a new scene" and mentions "Colonel Glenn" and "the United States".

The text in the document reads as follows:

"THIS was the moment. He had covered a distance of 302, miles in his three-orbit run around the earth on his back on a form-fit couch in the Friendship 7 capsule guided and guarded by his team of technicians and waited for Col. John Herschel Glenn Jr. to emerge, a dramatic first for the United States.

"This," said President Kennedy, "is a new scene, and President Eisenhower and others who have prepared for this moment. We are under the water today, but through this miracle, we have sent a pilot hurtling through space, the first American to go into space and come back. We have established contact, and as to the condition of Colonel Glenn, we await further details."

THE READER'S DIGEST
..shared with millions a day of miracles,
This story of your Readers Digest, which don't
wait till they happen to 
tell
you, but tell you
after they have happen-
ed: 
It was in 1952. Glenn spent a summer at the 
Edwards Air Force Base in California, to work
on a confidential new program to test some
rockets for the air force. Every day, Glenn would
go to the tracking station to watch the firing of
these rockets.
One day, as he was watching the firing, some-
thing caught his eye, moving briskly across the
sky. It wasn't a plane, a rocket, or anything they 
usually saw. Glenn watched as this object raced  
across the sky and disappeared over the Indian 
Ocean. Glenn began to report this phenomenon.
He was told there was the wonders of outer
space, and that this was a satellite-
like object
passing over. But Glenn insisted there was no
satellite up there at that time. This was something
else - something he couldn't identify. 
This object had made a tremendous speed and
the next crucial stage of the flight was the re-
entry and landing. Glenn continued to watch
for this object, and finally one day saw it come
back. "Capsule is turning around," he reported.
Oh, that was incredible! I can't believe that I can
see this. And sure enough, the object came back
to the same place it had disappeared before, just
a couple of hundred yards behind the tracking
station. Glenn set out to look at this object more
closely. But when he got to the place where he
thought it would land, there was nothing there.
The object had vanished. Nothing happened.
"I have had no ill effects as a result of seeing
this," Glenn later said. "It is simply a matter of
fact. Visual acuity is still excellent. But the more
I think of the incident, the more disturbing it
becomes."
Glenn had with him a small band camera to take
pictures of the rockets. But he didn't use it this
time. He was too intent on watching the object
rather than get the camera away.
But now, if only it had is mind and his camera
pointing at the exactly right moment - just as
though on an invisible shell, he might have
caught a glimpse of this incredible visitor. The

Text from the document:

US US, Air Force has come to light concerning an incident reported 6 April 1962, at 1400 hours, involving an unidentified aerial object observed at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The object was initially sighted at approximately 1400 hours by numerous observers, including several officers, airmen, and civilian personnel. The object, appearing to be a bright metallic sphere, was traveling at a high rate of speed and making a sizzling sound. It was observed by several persons over an approximate period of 15 minutes. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and was maneuvering in a northwesterly direction at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. It was observed to make a sudden stop, reverse its direction, and accelerate to a very high rate of speed as it disappeared from view. The craft then re-appeared in the same area several minutes later, repeating the same maneuvers. After these observations, it disappeared from sight and was not observed again. A number of personnel at the base made detailed reports of the incident. Project Mercury officials had studied the reports and had requested that the incident be thoroughly investigated by the Air Force. The reports were forwarded to the Director's office with recommendations for further action.

THIS RE-ENTRY REPORT
"Sustained after the re-entry them, with Glenn. At the same time, other slickly surface a shield began to hold the shield to the capsule during the re-entry. He knew by the hissing sounds of the scapes, but he hoped that the shield would stay in place. In a space of about 15 seconds, the capsule reached speeds so intense that his body was visibly hammered by g-forces far above the human tolerance. Life or Death. Glenn took the tremendous forces with extraordinary stamina. He made the difficult decision to try to jettison the shield. As he did so, the shield flew off, but not before it had scored the surface of the capsule around the window. Glenn could feel his body beginning to be scorched. He tried to lift the shield back to its place, but the forces were so great that he could not. The heat became apparent that something was terribly wrong. Glenn said later, "There were large areas some 5 to 6 inches wide and 12 to 15 inches long that were completely charred." The heat was so intense that it seemed as if the capsule was on fire. Glenn could smell the intense odor of burning metal and felt the heat intensely envelop him. On the ground, Astronaut Alan Shepard, the capsule communicator (CapCom), was growing increasingly alarmed at what was happening. "The chute's were disintegrating and it appeared that Glenn's capsule was going in fiery plunge."

JOHN GLENN AND HIS DAY OF MIRACLES

Still a pilot, John Glenn, was the "Flying Marine" who became the third American to orbit the earth. He was not only the first American to orbit the earth, but also the first astronaut to make an emergency landing at sea and the first to hoist a pinned-in pilot of a disabled plane into his own cockpit. 

Glenn's first orbital flight came on February 20, 1962 when he circled the earth three times in his tiny Mercury capsule named Friendship 7. His heart pumped steadily under the pressure and several times he almost blacked out from the intense G-forces, but he completed the flight.

In 1959 he entered Muskingum College, Ohio, and became a Marine Reservist on the football team. He soon ended most other activities to concentrate on flying. His first solo flight was in a Piper Cub operated by the Navy's program for civilians at Port Columbus, Ohio. In 1941 he joined the Marines and thereafter rose to the rank of Colonel in the Marine Corps. 

During World War II and the Korean War, Glenn flew long hours and displayed great skill. But it was his flight in 1962 that brought him worldwide fame and recognition. However, less known is his exploits as a fighter pilot and daring rescuer during the wars.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:
JOHN GLENN AND HIS DAY OF MIRACLES
Like all of you, I am proud to be an American. I feel I am your representative for all of the activities related to this program. I am highly honored and I feel that I am your representative, as I represent all the various scientific, technical, and administrative personnel back into the space race with a program and a project which I think is of enormous significance to the United States, and to all the people of the world. Contrasted with similar Russian flights, it was a great achievement, and all of us who have had a part in it may well be proud. Woodrow Wilson once said: "The great fact about our day is that the world is smaller than it used to be in my time, or in the time of any man who has recently lived." Technically, it is justified and required the long labor, development and dedication of many scientists and technicians of the U.S. space program into which the Nation has so intelligently poured its resources. For man himself, it produced some valuable lessons, gained through the astronauts Gagarin and Titov, the world knows much more with certainty how man can live and work in space. Based on this period (Glenn's) early experiment, space is not the vacuum. The body did not disintegrate, as was some of the prognostication. The man did not blow over the controls, himself and we very thankfully found that man's genius and versatility, answering the critics who have added information. This flight, I hope, added a bit more.

JOHN GEORGE LEMARE: "I do not believe that God ever intended to exclude so man that man could find one for himself."

Race Discrimination With a Union Label
By Lester Veile
While union constitutions boast of brotherhood, unionmen in America have been opposed to the general freedom to seek employment and, in many cases, have denied them from such entirely.
Unionmen, equally and invariably, Union labor battles for the exclusion of Negro labor from various trades - the electricians, plumbers, sheet metal workers and others - who make up the building and construction industries, and engravers, and many locals of the craftunions.
For although the 13th-13th-14th Amendment and the civil rights acts have made these discriminatory practices illegal, the unions still maintain a semi-closed shop and deny Negroes the right to learn many of the skilled crafts although this denies them the means of earning a livelihood. 
In Washington D.C., school children of "Negro" parentage are not admitted to the integrated schools, but are set up in separate, segregated schools, contrary to the Supreme Court decision. This very same situation obtains in many other areas where unions have a strong stranglehold and cling tenaciously to the "white supremacy" policy.

THE CLEE (or the identity of the CLEE as it appears in the text) describes the "Glenn Effect" and its anomalous properties, such as the object becoming luminous when the face of the object is turned away from the sun. The text also mentions the involvement of Professors Opik and Ahnert in studying the "Glenn Effect" and their findings.

SUBJECTS
BREATHING-ANALYSIS OF THE DATA FROM WALKER'S RECENT SIGHTING.

As a result of the analysis of the data from Walker's recent sighting, the following information has been obtained:

1. The object was sighted at approximately 1400 local time on 8 April 1962 by the flight crew of an Air Force KC-135 jet tanker during a routine navigation flight over the Edwards Air Force Base, California, area.

2. The object was observed at an altitude of approximately 22,000 feet, or 4 miles, during the formation of the aircraft.

3. The object appeared to be cylindrical in shape, and was observed to be white in color. Its size was estimated to be approximately 60 feet in length and 20 feet in diameter.

4. The object was observed to be motionless and stationary in relation to the aircraft during the entire period of the sighting, which lasted approximately 3 minutes.

5. The object did not appear to emit any exhaust or trail, nor did it display any evidence of propulsion.

6. During the sighting, the object was observed to be surrounded by a hazy, luminous glow, approximately 5 to 10 feet in width, which seemed to emanate from the exterior surface of the object.

7. The object was observed to be completely silent and did not produce any audible sound.

8. Several attempts were made by the flight crew to establish radio communication with the object, but no response was received.

9. After the sighting, the crew made an immediate report to the base operations, and the incident was subsequently investigated by the Air Force.

10. The report concludes that the object was a genuine unidentified flying object, and that its nature and origin remain unknown.
