PHOTOS: N
LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1.5
BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: While returning from Westville, Indiana to LaPorte, Indiana at approximately 10:00 PM, a bright silvery object was observed in the south western sky. The object appeared very large, and moved rapidly. It was visible for approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of 1,000 feet and was moving at a high rate of speed, estimated to be approximately 1,000 miles per hour. The object appeared to be emitting some type of bright light. It disappeared suddenly into the distant sky. Observation was made visually.
COMMENTS: Possibly an aircraft of some kind. However, the observed speed and size of the object would be far in excess of normal aircraft performance. The speed and size of the object may be impossible or difficult to determine accurately from ground observation. The object was not observed on radar or by air intercept radar.

I think the light was about 10 degrees above the horizon and approximately 30 degrees from due south."

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

20 July 
76 m 64
Dear Sirs; 
While I was at camp with my Boy Scout troop I saw an unusual light in the sky. I saw the object at about 8:15 p.m. which is located about 1 1/2 miles in a westerly direction from our camp. The object remained stationary for a period of approximately 10 to 15 minutes. It then began to slowly move in a northerly direction. As it moved north, it began to lose its brilliance and soon disappeared from sight. The object was brilliantly lit and appeared to be oval in shape. I was never able to get a clear view of the details because the sky was partly cloudy and the object was rather high in the sky. This sighting was made on July 18, 1962 at approximately 8:15 p.m. in the vicinity of Westville, Indiana.

Sincerely yours,
Hammond, Ind.
Aug.21, 1962

There is no photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a series of questions and text responses, but no visual image.

Transcription of the text in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" on the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

A seemed to be a rapid movement straight across my sight, no changes in direction.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this test, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

About 1/3 the length of the match stick compared to the object

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

Seemed to just disappear suddenly without a trace.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance.

Because of its rapidity it seemed to be a missile or similar fast moving device. It was hard to tell for sure that color or size just that it came across the sight in a very rapid motion.
