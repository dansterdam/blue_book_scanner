OCT 26 1954

Dear Mr. _____, 

Thank you for submitting the sighting information in response to your letter of September 1954. 

This refers to your sighting of 6,000 UFO objects in the Air Force area of Roswell, New Mexico on ___ of September 1954. It provides information on analysis made by the Air Force scientific advisory board regarding the evaluation of this sighting. 

We do not have any photographs of unidentified flying objects. Also, since your sighting involved numerous objects, it would not be feasible to try to obtain photographs. The bright light that you have observed on so many occasions has characteristics of a natural phenomenon that is commonly observed and BLUE BOOK types I and II have determined it does not represent an unusual or unidentified object.

Sincerely, 

MAJOR M. JACKS
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
Public Information Division
Office of Information

Dear sirs:
The information I received is not at what I would like to know. During the examination of all aspects, I found that the report was incorrect and inaccurate, and ask if you could possibly send 6 or 20 reports, balloons, etc. and information on your analysis, procedures are almost completed and details will be provided to you later.
Possibly could send a photograph or two of some U.F.O.s.

AUGUST 4, 1964

Dear Sir:

This letter summarizes our teleconference of July 31, 1964 in which we discussed the present problem with the __________ and the possible methods of handling it. We have carefully studied the report from the police department and my file, and I think we now have enough about the situation to decide on a course of action.

As I indicated on the phone, I would like to get more information of this UFO case reported from the same area. Perhaps you or your office could send some information on the incident. This would help us as we consider a plan of action for 1964.

Sincerely yours,
