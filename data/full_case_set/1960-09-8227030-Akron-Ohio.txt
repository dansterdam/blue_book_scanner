"My sister and I saw a strange flying object last night at about 9:00 p.m. We were driving home from our jobs downtown. We were driving north on Route 8, a major highway, when my sister suddenly exclaimed, "Look at that strange object in the sky!" I glanced up and was amazed to see a large, bright, oval-shaped object hovering in the western sky. It seemed to be about 30-40 feet in diameter and was brilliant white in color, with a slightly fluorescent glow. The object was completely silent and seemed to be floating motionless in the sky. We watched it for about 2-3 minutes before it suddenly accelerated at an incredible speed and disappeared from view. It was unlike anything I have ever seen in the sky before. I am certain it was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. I have no explanation for what we saw that night. The experience was both fascinating and a little frightening. I can only describe it as a true unidentified flying object."

The sky was clear and the moon shone brightly on the  night of September 8, 1960, in Akron, Ohio. At approximately  11:20 p.m., the witness, a man, was looking out of a window  in his apartment when he noticed an unusual object in the sky. 
The object appeared to be elongated in shape and was accompanied  by a trail of white lights. It moved slowly across the sky in a straight line  before disappearing from view. The witness reported the incident to the  police, who in turn, notified the Air Force. An investigation was conducted,  but no explanation for the sighting could be determined.

AUTHOR'S SUMMARY
BACKGROUND
Project Blue Book was the designation of one of a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. It started in 1952, the third study of its kind, and it was the longest, running for nearly twenty-two years until its termination on 17 December 1969. 
The goal of Project Blue Book was to determine if UFOs were a threat to national security, and to scientifically analyze UFO-related data. 
At the time, all investigations and studies of UFOs by the U.S. Government were centralized at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, where Project Blue Book was headquartered. The project was initially managed by the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC).
This report covers the period from 1 January 1949 through 31 December 1969. It represents a review and analysis of the 12,618 UFO reports received and evaluated by Project Blue Book during that time.
