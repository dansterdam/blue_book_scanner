This report was received in the 3rd Command Post by a civilian source who alleged that on 1 September 1963 a yellow and orange light object was observed traveling in a south to north direction in the vicinity of Fort Yuma, California. The object was said to have passed over South Ridge, California, and that the observers lost sight of the object approximately 5 miles west of Niland, California. The time of observation was approximately 15 to 20 minutes. No sound and no trail. The object was said to have appeared to be at an altitude of about 3,000 feet and to have moved in a horizontal, straight-line flight path. The observers reported that no aircraft was in the area at the time and that they were unable to identify the object.
