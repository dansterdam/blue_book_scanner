The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Project Blue Book record card from 26 June 1963, describing an observation made in Texarkana, Texas.

PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 26 June 1963
2. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local
3. DURATION: 40-45 sec
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. CAT: CAT 1
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Several seconds round
7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Two
8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Two objects in trail, round, with a color, observed very high in the N.W. This object split four different places along the trail, and faded in the North after a half hour observation. Observation at night (10:45 PM).
9. CONCLUSIONS: Was Probably Balloon, Possible Satellite, Possibly Aircraft
10. COMMENTS: Description of objects conforms with Balloon observations. Trailing appears to be balloon or debris. Direction of flight and variability at upper altitudes. Direction finding variable, this suggests variable motion. Nothing indicates positively a balloon observation, but nothing indicates positively any other type observation.
