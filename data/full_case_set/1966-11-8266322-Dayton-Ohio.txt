14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes -- it faded out as it passed overhead.  

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):     Yes     No     Don't know.
If you answered YES, then tell what.

If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Shape -- round
b. Color -- a bright light-like a star

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and see how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have performed this experiment at the time of sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Probably all of it.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

When I first saw the light I thought it was a plane landing. This was because it was much brighter than any stars. After watching it for a short while my impression changed. It was not going down but appeared to be rising in the sky. By the time it faded out it was almost directly overhead at what appeared to be a good distance away.

At the time - I was a newscaster for a local television station. It consisted of two unidentified bright objects which appeared in the sky, traveling with tremendous speed. There were two objects in rapid pursuit of each other. There was a bluish white light which seemed to come from the objects as they traveled. I watched the objects for a period of approximately ten to fifteen minutes, after which they disappeared. There was nothing else unusual about their maneuvering, except the tremendous speed at which they traveled. I was talking to a neighbor on the telephone at the time, and she saw the objects also. Day 10th he was talking to a neighbor on the telephone at the time, Dragging in New Robinson. He saw 38 38 38 -

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
(Circle One): YES - NO - IF SO, WHAT DID IT MOVE BEHIND? IF YOU ANSWERED YES, THEN TELL WHAT IT MOVED BEHIND: IT DIDN'T, IT WASN'T OBVIOUS. PERHAPS CLOUDS OBSCURED IT MOMENTARILY.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

REGARDING MY ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD OF TIME THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE, THE FOLLOWING OCCURRED:  IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING MOTIONLESS AROUND 250 FEET OUT OF THE SCHOOL BUILDING INTO THE PARKING LOT. AFTER ABOUT 30 SECONDS IT STARTED TO LIFT OFF AND HOVERED ABOUT 15 FEET OFF THE GROUND FOR A FEW SECONDS BEFORE MAKING A VERY FAST DEPARTURE.  IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 20 FEET IN DIAMETER AND DISK-SHAPED.  IT WAS OBSERVED BY AT LEAST ONE BLINKING OR FLASHING LIGHT ON ITS UNDERSIDE.  WHEN IT BEGAN TO LIFT OFF, IT SEEMED TO JUST HANG SUSPENDED IN THE AIR FOR A MOMENT BEFORE DARTING AWAY AT A TREMENDOUS RATE OF SPEED.  IT HEADED STRAIGHT UP AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN ABOUT 5 SECONDS.  IT SEEMED TO BE MOVING AT A CONSTANT VELOCITY.  IT APPEARED TO INCREASE AND DECREASE IN VELOCITY, OR TO HAVE VARYING PERIODS OF ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION.  THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE TRANSLUCENT OR SEMI-TRANSPARENT, AND SEEMED TO BE REFLECTING OR REFRACTING THE LIGHT AROUND IT.  WHEN IT WAS HOVERING, IT SEEMED TO OSCILLATE SLIGHTLY IN THE AIR, ALMOST AS IF IT WERE PULSATING.  I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS, BUT IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ANYTHING CONVENTIONAL THAT I'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE.  THE ENTIRE SIGHTING LASTED LESS THAN A MINUTE.

They covered a very large area, about 20 degrees of the sky. 

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and specifically show the direction the object was moving.

Contact was made with WP AFB operations regarding the observance of an alleged UFO over the Dayton area on 18 Nov. 66 at approx 5:10 PM. There were two aircraft which landed at the base shortly before the sighting as described. There was no traffic in the area at the time.

Description is inconsistent with that of an aircraft which would be in a slowly rising or a rapidly climbing situation. It is possible that the observed pattern both aircraft were of the DD-6 class.
