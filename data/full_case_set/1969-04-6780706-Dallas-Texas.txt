This replies to your letter of April 30, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we could not attempt to tell you what you saw. However, if you will complete the enclosed questionnaire and mail it to the address shown, only, will we be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Would you ever see another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Such base in the United States is the nearest Air Force installation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the project Blue Book file we are including.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS
WEEKLY SERIES APR. 14-20, 1969
The Surface Weather Map presents actual data and the analysis thereof, as shown as dashed lines, and the forecast isobars in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed in 5-millibar levels.
The Highest and Lowest Temperature figures chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 7:00 a.m. EST. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature for a reporting point is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature (in degrees F) is plotted below the station location.
The Precipitation Areas and Amount Chart indicates by means of shading the areas of precipitation amounts for the preceding 24 hours ending at 7:00 a.m. EST. The amounts of precipitation are indicated by the degree of shading; the legend indicates that dark shading represents 0.50 inch or more, medium shading 0.10 to 0.49 inch, and light shading 0.01 to 0.09 inch. Absence of shading indicates less than 0.01 inch.
It should be noted that the 500 Millibar Chart indicates contour lines of constant pressure at the 500 millibar level, approximately 18,000 feet above sea level, and that the Daily Precipitation Summary shows the maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation amounts for the 24-hour period ending at 7:00 a.m. EST for selected cities across the nation. Each single page of this publication can be obtained from the National Climatic Center, Asheville, North Carolina 28801, at a cost of $2.50 per copy.

Dear Sara,

One of the nights of Apr. 29 a car came along the road past our home. As it neared the house, the lights went out for a second, then came back on. The car then slowed down and seemed to float across our field and out of sight. It made no sound and was about 15 feet off the ground.

Sincerely,

DAILY WEATHER MAPS:
WEEKLY SERIES APR. 21-27, 1969

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the Natiollal weather Bureaus Daily Weather Maps. They include the weather analyses and forecasts shown on the Daily Weather Map. the Highest and lowest Temperature Chart, the Surface Weather Map, and the map showing the 500-millibar contours.

The Surface Weather Map presents the station data and the analysis for 7:00 A.M. E.S.T. The tracks of low pressure areas are indicated by dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed in 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperature Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. E.S.T. The values are obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperatures are plotted above the station circles, and the minimum temperatures are plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. E.S.T. Amounts in inches to the nearest hundredth of an inch are for the same period. Incomplete items are not assigned values and are represented by a "T" to indicate a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground in inches as of 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

The image appears to contain two sketches or diagrams. The larger sketch on the left shows a series of wavy, curved lines that could potentially represent contour lines or some kind of terrain or landscape. The smaller sketch on the right appears to show a more geometric, abstract pattern of shapes and lines.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and extract the text from the document:

DALLAS, TEXAS
In interview with witness, Capt. WALTER HAUT, 1st Sgt., R.C.M, AF, related the following:
On 6 April 1969 at approximately 2030 hrs., while driving west on Mockingbird Lane, he observed a large oval-shaped object hovering at an estimated 300 feet altitude and approximately 150 yards distant. The object was approximately 30 feet in diameter and appeared to be spinning or rotating in a clockwise direction. The object emitted a dull glow and was silent. After observing the object for approximately 2 minutes, it suddenly accelerated in a vertical direction and disappeared from view in less than 10 seconds. Capt. HAUT stated that during the time the object was observed, several other people on the street were also watching it.
