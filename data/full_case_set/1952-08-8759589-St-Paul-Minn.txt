Folkston, G. C.,
Nov. 5, 1954.

Department of Defense,
Washington, D. C.

I am writing this letter to make a delayed report---delayed
because I did not know where to send it---of a "flying saucer," or some other
strange object seen by me on August 9, 1952, 9:35 p. m., checked by my watch,
which was near correct.

Preliminary to trying to give you a word picture of this object
and the circumstances and conditions that existed or prevailed at this time
will state that about sunset we had a moderate thundershower which lasted
with the accompanying rain for about an hour, after which the cloud
passed on to the East, but leaving the sky dark and overcast for till
about 10:00 o'clock, with an occasional flash of lightning to the East and
Southeast. My house fronts------miles south of 12th and
with all the buildings pretty well scattered. Across the street in front of
my house a grove of trees covering about a block, with a cleared opening
All the way through, a hundred feet wide and narrowing to about 60 feet
on the opposite street, past which there is a decline or reaching several
hundred yards, then bottom land on a creek for half a mile, then upward for
half a mile to about the level of my house. The depression bit two -A the hill
within a line end on each other is a ratio not more than 50 feet, end
there is a clear view from my house to the horizon when I look down the cleared
or open gine.

On the August night mentioned I was at home alone reading in a front
room. About a quarter past (date not known on the porch, and then sat down in it porch
chair to smoke and cool off a little. The thermometer on the porch registered
is 65 degrees. I was looking straight down this cleared line in front of and
in the dark toward the dark clouds. On the left of the lane the trees were
tall all the way across, but on the right side there were no tall trees
except one or two at the end of the line.

Suddenly, through the foliage of the tall trees on the right I saw
a light moving, and I was looking directly at it when it crossed the end of
the Lane and disappeared behind the nearby tall trees that further obstructed my
view. I had a clear and perfect view of the object for five or six seconds.
This object was perfect round. The center of it was perfectly round and bright
rose colored read, eighteen inches or so in diameter, and around this red was
very bright bluish of morethan a foot broad and perfectly round, and around
this there was a white, steamish looking circle a foot or more broad and
perfectly round.---apparently dimmer at the edges. It plainer, brighter
picture could not be painted. The colors were plainer than my rainbow, and
it was lower than the clouds with a 2 clock position; it apparently was
traveling apparently from Southeast to Northwest, and seemed to be light
on the rise.

My eyes were probably at. 2nd let above level ground, saw there
Quite into clear view was probably fifty feet above level ground.

---
I have no idea the distance it was away from me. It could have been a mile or many miles, but it did not come out of a cloud, and was underneath the cloud.

This was not imagination, neither did it come from any reflection, nor was it caused by any defect of my eyes. Though I use 1.73 years old, and requires[strong glasses for reading I only use them when I read and did not have them on at the time I saw this object. It did not excite me at all. I looked away to the first time with, and showed it unto to a neighbor's house and related to him what I had seen, was he made no voice to me about it. I also wrote a short letter to the Charlotte Daily Observer, which they published. I told this and persons whom I met about it afterwards. I have found quite some that others have seen unusual things in the air in the day time and at night, but since people are inclined to take such accounts as a joke or a delusion they do not care to tell about them.

I have seen many meteors in my life time--and one large one that exploded in the air, also Northern Lights, total eclipse of the sun, balloons, airplanes, etc., but I have never seen anything excite perfectly bright lights of o.
as skeptical as any one could be about flying saucers. Now I believe what I read about most of them. Several unusual things have been seen in the last few years in North Carolina and also in South Carolina that probably have never been reported.

Respectfully,

[Signature blocked out for privacy]

P.S. – I am out quite used to typewriting, forgive any mistakes and spelling, since I am more accustomed to write what I have had to write.

To the best of my celebrity, I have answered
your questionnaire without equivocation.
The optical phenomenon on Saturday could be
mistaken for a jet plane but, I of the couple
alone and disagree—rather, the spectacle
is described by the following schematic:
If jet were far enough away to be mistaken imperceptible
it is at least six miles away, I concede; and it then
would pass 128° 12' 48" - 63° 36' 44" in sec; so wide object
moved 23 deg 36' 04" est. in 0.952 2017644 sec or 14.98 miles/min
(1080 miles per hour).

The object I saw Sunday was like a pearlescent ball
in the clear sky. As we watched, it slowed down and
it gradually came to the object and completely vanished in
an even mode place for a crowd. I disappeared completely
from eyesight in the clear sky. The sun was very bright
at that moment; I aimed in the same spot on 7x50
Binoculars and Binoculars but I could not pan
it again nor could my under Data correlated
Bernard Mills Research Laboratory and they had
me there were no balloons in that area during
the breadth. It is a mechanical device, something
in a drawing, seen before by many other eyes.
