According to the flight engineer, the object took only about six seconds to move from the southern horizon to a weather front near the northern horizon. The distance covered was about 30 degrees and the brightness of the sighting was that there was no trajectory to the path of the object, it traveled at a steady speed which did not vary. Our thanks for sending in this information.
