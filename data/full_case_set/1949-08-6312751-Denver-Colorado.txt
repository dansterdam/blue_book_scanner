thought might be a "Flying Disc". Observation was made in Mr. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * located. Object was reported at an altitude of 40,000 feet, traveling west on a 260
degree heading. Object maintained level flight and faded from view in approximately
twenty seconds. Estimated speed of object was 700 miles per hour, Object was shaped
similar to a flying disc with horizontal wings trimmed in, allowing the disc to have
an oval shaped appearance. Mr * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * is a former Armament Officer, and who is
well acquainted with the conventional types of aircraft, estimated the diameter of
this object to be approximately the same as a B-26, or 50 feet. When sighted, the
angle of elevation was approximately 85 degrees, the color and construction of the
material was similar to aluminum. Mr * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * described the object as highly polished.
