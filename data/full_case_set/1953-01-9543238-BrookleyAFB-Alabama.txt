Intelligence Officer: Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama
Details: At approximately 0900 hours, 5 January 1953, Captain [REDACTED] came to the Brookley Air Force Base Intelligence Office. He stated that the previous night, while flying his F-51 aircraft on a routine night training mission, he had sighted an unusual light in the sky. He stated that the light disappeared after about 30 seconds. He saw no other lights while in the air, and no other aircraft were observed.

Near Operations, and nearby Bates Field (Commercial), were contacted by telephone and confirmed no aircraft were operating in the vicinity at the time. No other fields in the immediate vicinity reported any activity.

When the light was sighted, the observer was facing West at latitude 30 degrees. Thirty-eight minutes North, 88 degrees, seven minutes West, and stated that the light was hovering for that period of time. It then appeared to accelerate rapidly, and disappeared. No sound was heard.

The credibility of the observer is unquestioned. Captain [REDACTED] is a Senior Pilot, with ten years flying experience, and is familiar with meteorology and navigation.

Since the report was not received until twelve hours after observation, interception was not attempted.

STATEMENT OF: Captain Douglas G. [REDACTED]

I certify that the following was observed by me while attending a drive-in movie, between 2015 and 2030 on the night of 1 January 1953.

I saw this light when it was approximately 90° to my left. It was traveling at a constant altitude of 2000-2500 feet on a bearing of north. The object appeared to be 1 to 2 feet in diameter of bluish white in color with a small exhaust trail. The speed of the object was estimated at 250-300 knots. It traveled through approximately 80° of an arc in 30 seconds and appeared to short a climbing turn and disappeared, just as though someone had turned off a light switch.

The object was approximately 1 mile away and it looked like the exhaust of a F-84 with afterburner going. As it approached, the windows of the car were up and the loudspeaker was on. I could not see anything at all to identify it as an aircraft, as there were no lights on the object. Weather at the time was clear with unrestricted visibility.
