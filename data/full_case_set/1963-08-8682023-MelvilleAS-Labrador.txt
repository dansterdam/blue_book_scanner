1. DATE: 5 Aug 63
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 0528/272
5. PHOTOS: Yes, Radar Scope
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 2.5 mins
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Two objs with normal paint on height finder on site about 2 miles of n/s observed for almost 1 min. Objs were 2 miles apart. Initial pickup on HRI at 60,000 ft 1.12 deg azimuth (6) miles range. Disappearance at 166 deg azimuth 7+ miles range. Height fluctuated between 60,000 to 80,000 ft. Vertical movement. Normal AP. T-33 airborne could not get visual contact. 2 flights were scrambled for identification and could not get further pickup on visual contact. Seems flighty and 6.5 s rounded in attempt to gain visual contact without success.
11. COMMENTS: Negatives of scope analysis submitted for further radar corner refle- ction the most probable solution. Would be from a/c traveling high speed intercept radar.

TRANSCRIPTION:

The handwritten text on the image reads as follows:

"From report of Melville A. S. 
Labrador - August 8, 1963

Unidentified flying object was observed just off shore and moved over the water. It was oval in shape, glowing with a bluish-white light. It hovered for several minutes and then accelerated rapidly disappearing into the distance. The object was under intelligent control as it made abrupt changes in direction and speed."

- page 4 -

The image appears to be a black and white photograph showing a bright object or light streak in the sky. The image is blurry and indistinct, making it difficult to make out any definitive details. There are no humans or other identifiable objects in the image.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

1963-08-8682023-MelvilleAS-Labrador.pdf5.txt

- page 5 -

The image appears to be a black and white photograph that shows a landscape. The photograph depicts a horizon line with a cloudy sky above and what appears to be a beach or shore with some kind of path or trail leading to the water's edge below. There are no discernible human figures or other distinct objects in the image.

Dear Mr. Melville,

This is in reference to your recent report regarding a UFO sighting in the Labrador area. We have reviewed the details and the photograph you provided, and we appreciate you taking the time to document this incident.

While the nature of the object in the sky is not entirely clear, we will continue to investigate this case as part of our ongoing efforts to understand and document unidentified aerial phenomena. Your observations and evidence are valuable contributions to our research.

Please let us know if you have any additional details or information that could aid our investigation. We will be in touch with you as we progress.

Thank you again for your diligence and cooperation.

Sincerely,
Project Blue Book

1. Since visual contact of the target was not made in this case, it is impossible to make contact with certainty what caused the phenomena observed on the ground.

2. Equipment malfunction can be ruled out, since several radar displays the same target, and anomalous propagation appears to be unlikely.

3. From the activity of the target, it appears that the most likely explanation is balloons under some sort of control, possibly meteorological balloons of the type used by some of the weather countries. Balloons have been known to travel in strings or trains, and the lights observed could likely be the balloon itself or the cables connecting the balloons.
