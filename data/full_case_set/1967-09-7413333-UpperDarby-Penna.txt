35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

It seems I have filled out a report before, a few years ago I was in near my home working in my yard when I saw an object in the sky. It was circular in shape and had alternating light rays or energy beams coming from the underside. It was hovering stationary at first. Then it took off at a fantastic speed, there was no sound. The first time I watched it for about 5 minutes. The last time I saw it was on January 27, 1965. It was very low, maybe 200 feet up, and just slowly drifted across the sky and went out of sight. I have not seen it since then. The U.S.A.F. detachment at Media, PA, knows about it. They said they could not identify it.

Mr.Eugene Conndntino
University of Colorado 

Reference is your letter of 27 March 1963 to which you requested information on the UFO observed by the witness 13 September 1967. the delay in replying, however, was caused by the fact that we did not receive the information on the sighting until 29 September 1967. the witness said he took a photograph. The negative was developed at only one place and therefore no prints were available. We requested information on the sighting and photographic data to respond.

As no copy completed AF Form 117 on the witness' s 27 March 1963 sighting. All to date is his 13 September 1967 sighting.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14
PART II-ANALYSIS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORTS RECEIVED THROUGH DECEMBER 1952

I.   BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
    A. Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 was prepared by the Directorate of Intelligence, United States Air Force. It contains an analysis of unidentified flying object (UFO) reports received through December 1952, as part of Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's program for investigating UFO sightings.
    B. The objectives of this report were to examine the available UFO data, determine the reliability of the reports, and evaluate the possible explanations for the sightings.

II. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
    A. Analysis of the 3,201 UFO reports received through December 1952 revealed that the majority could be explained as misidentifications of conventional objects or phenomena.
    B. Approximately 23% of the reports were classified as "unidentified", meaning they could not be explained with the available information.
    C. The report concluded that there was no evidence of a threat to national security from the UFO phenomenon, and that the available data did not support the existence of interplanetary vehicles.

III. RECOMMENDATIONS
    A. The report recommended that Project Blue Book continue its investigation of UFO reports, with the goal of identifying and explaining as many sightings as possible.
    B. It also suggested that the collection and analysis of UFO data be improved to better understand the phenomenon.

This appears to be a page from Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14, which was an analysis of UFO reports received by the United States Air Force through December 1952. The document provides background on the project, a summary of the findings and conclusions, and recommendations for future investigations.

OCR TEXT OUTPUT:
UPPER DARBY, PENNA. SEPTEMBER 7, 1967
At approximately 1:45 p.m. on September 7, 1967, Mrs. NANCY KING, 6611 Heulings Lane, Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, reported sighting an unidentified flying object.

She described the object as being round or oval in shape and approximately the size of a quarter held at arm's length. The object appeared to be very high in the sky and was moving in a zig-zag pattern. Mrs. KING watched the object for approximately 2-3 minutes before it disappeared from view.
Mrs. KING could not identify the object and did not hear any sound associated with it. She stated that the object was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any other known aircraft.

The image contains a sketch depicting a UFO sighting. There is no photograph present in this page. The text on the page appears to be instructions or questions related to the sketch, asking the viewer to imagine themselves at certain points and provide information about the observed object and its movement.

Transcribing the text:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (altitude) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (altitude) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
