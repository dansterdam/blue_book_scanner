ORIGINATING AGENCY: Flight 2-9, 46o2d AISS
SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
1. A check with the McGhee-Tyson Weather Station was made and the following information was received: At the time of the sighting sky was clear with no clouds in the area of sighting. Winds were surface sw 5k, 5000' 360 deg 20k, 10,000' 330 deg 35K, 20,000' 300 deg 50k, 20,000.
2. A check with the McGhee-Tyson flight service revealed negative observations by commercial airlines.
3. The intelligence officer at the nearest base could provide no regular reporting channels for information and therefore had no information.
4. Knoxville Filter Center reported negative reports from observers.
5. The 663rd ACW Sq did not track objects on radar.
6. After visual observation 663rd ACW Sq direction center scrambled two (2) F-86D aircraft after objects. No completed intercept accomplished nor identification made on the objects.
7. Base intelligence officer reported negative.

SOURCE was cooperative and of average intelligence.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE observed the objects from about 2240 (UTC 0212) to 2302 Nov 55. Objects were sighted at 240° azimuth and at an elevation of 15°. SOURCE was certain he observed the objects for about 22 minutes. The sky condition was bright twilight and a few stars were observed. As SOURCE looked at the objects the sun was in front of him. Objects appeared larger than the background of the sky. The objects appeared to be constructed of an aluminum material and were brilliantly shiny. The edges were sharply outlined. The objects appeared to be constructed of two sections and solid. They were dull orange in color and stood out in contrast to the sunset. SOURCE was certain that the objects compared in size to a footballfiield at arm's length. SOURCE was looking toward the southwest when first sighting the objects and toward the west when they disappeared from view. When disappearing they showed rapid elevation and disappeared at a great distance. SOURCE had never witnessed a similar sighting previously.

ORIGINATING AGENCY: PROJECT 10-2-S, 14502d AISS
REPORT NO: 2B-UFOB-8-58
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. There were four other sightings of this object at OAK RIDGE (ORGP 1152), TENN. Questionaires were distributed to the four individuals to be filled out. The uniformity of the observations had to be clarified and could not be determined at that time. It was understood that this would involve a minimum delay. OAK RIDGE was called subsequently on two occasions to request that the questionaires be forwarded for this unit - but after a protracted delay it was felt this report should be submitted minus the additional questionnaires.
2. These comments are based upon a summary of the observations of the seven sources available. Six of the sources were military personnel with high school or college educations, and the seventh source was a civilian telephone company maintenance foreman. Four of the observers recorded the data on the spot while the other three received them later from within various automobiles, and it was not determined where the other observers were located when the observations were made. Most of them are said to have seen the objects appear to have been made up of metals, been orange in color and elliptical in shape similar to a well known design of aircraft, and they emitted a bright light from several blocks to a mile away. Sources indicated the objects did not shine down very much, just giving off a bright glow. They were observed for a minimum of thirty seconds, a maximum of twenty minutes and an average duration estimated to have been from eight to ten minutes. 
3. The long duration of observation (average of ten minutes) and the shape seem to rule out the possibility of these objects having been meteors. Neither could they have been aircraft in normal flight characteristics, since they were motionless at times. Balloons would not give a radar return unless they carried some kind of wind tracking device. All sources indicated the sun was going down and it was getting dark when the sightings occurred. This might account for the orange coloration, as the shape of the objects would appear to have been elliptical or circular while hovering or stationary, this condition described as being ecliptical or circular.

CONTENTS of Preparing Officer (Contd):
It. These deductions seem to eliminate all of the possibilities ex-cept optical or weather phenomena. They would have no restrictions as to size, shape, length of observation, course, speed, color or distance. They would not necessarily have a known reason for existing. They are probably more difinite than those mentioned above. The object was low on the horizon and some stars could already be observed. It was indicated in the initial report that interceptors were sent out but re-ported negative results. This seems to substantiate the premise that the object was some type of phenomenon rather than material. The preparing officer believes that this larger deduction is more possible than the former so-lutions.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
Further investigative efforts revealed the presence of two temperature inversions (surface to 2,000' and 11,000' to 13,000') in the area of the sighting at the time of the sighting.
It is the opinion of this headquarters that the sighting was probably caused by the viewing of the planet Venus through the above mentioned temperature inversions.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was completely thorough in his description of the sighting. CONICE was extremely competent and of superior intelligence.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE and his son were in their yard (100 yards from their home) when the objects were sighted at an elevation of 30° - 35° from the horizon. SOURCE observed the objects at 6:05 p.m. and with binoculars observed them for 10 minutes. 
The sky condition was bright twilight. The sighting was of two oblong objects, semi-luminous and of bright golden color. The objects travelled at terrific speed, sometimes flapping their "wings" as they did look like they were machine powered, and at a terrific rate of speed, moving towards and away from each other at 10 miles apart and approximately 25 miles away, flying west but not into the sun. SOURCE estimates they were between 100 and 200 feet. As SOURCE trained his sight on the objects, the brightness increased to an automobile headlight a mile or more away. The brightness and shape of the objects were consistent. The sighting was erratic and they seemed to suddenly speed up and push away. The objects did not give off smoke, break up, or pulse. CONICE was fairly certain of the objects as compared in size to a half-dollar held at arm's length. Objects were last sighted at 26,000 altitude and did not disappear due to distance but rather dimmed in the haze. 
SOURCE estimates the distance of the objects to be from 15 to 20 miles and speed to be 600 plus MPH.

II. RELIABILITY: Subject was thorough in his description of the sighting. He appears to be reliable and sincere in his statements.

III. SUBJECT'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCES observed two objects from approximately 5:30 P.M. 29 November 55 until an observation of 29:30 from the horizon. The objects were observed at 2122:35, Nov 55 and was "fairly bright." They maintained a high rate of speed and appeared to gain or lose elevation occasionally. The objects emitted a light, luminous, oscillating or flashing and approximately 35-foot section, and were silver and yellow in color, consistent with lighted objects. They did not change brilliance or color and were easily seen, though rather small against the sky. During the observation, Subject lost sight of the objects temporarily, but reacquired them shortly thereafter. The objects appeared to be solid. The sighting ended when they moved away in a high speed above the horizon. SOURCES had never previously witnessed such a sighting.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE observed the objects while driving his automobile on Highway #61 at 2:22 A.M. Nov 55. The objects were observed to be of a circular configuration, and were flying northward about 2500-3000 feet in the air. The objects appeared to be of metal construction, and were flying high and very fast. The objects would disappear and then reappear in a different position, apparently travelling at a high rate of speed. The objects were viewed through an auto windshield and had a bright orange glow. The entire observation lasted about 2 to 3 minutes. The objects seemed to be hovering or at a standstill at times, and the objects crossed the horizon and disappeared from view.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was thorough in his description of the sighting. SOURCE was very cooperative and of average intelligence.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: SOURCE observed the objects from approximately 6:00 to 6:20 p.m. on 1 September 1955. SOURCE said the objects were first sighted about 6 to 10 miles away and were fairly certain that he observed them for 20 minutes. The sky condition was bright twilight and very clear. The objects were brighter than the sky background and had a yellow-orange neon light appearance with no discernible shape or internal details. The objects were flying level, and there were at least five of them. SOURCE said that they appeared to be made of metal. The objects were elliptical in shape and about 100 feet long. SOURCE was facing southeast when the objects were first sighted and when they were last seen, he was facing west at 265° azimuth and looking 20° above the horizon. SOURCE estimated the objects to be 8 to 10 miles away. SOURCE had not sighted similar objects previously.
