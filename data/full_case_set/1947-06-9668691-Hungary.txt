INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS of EVIDENCE

across the sky. Reports too brief for 
a firm evaluation.

Rumors were that the object was sphere shape and silver in
color, traveling at high speed.

---

Incident #168 - Hungary -- around 10 June 1947

It is extremely unlikely that the objects observed in
Hungary were meteorites, unless the meager description given here
is quite inaccurate. Without knowledge of the speed and trajectory
of the objects, nothing definite can be said.
