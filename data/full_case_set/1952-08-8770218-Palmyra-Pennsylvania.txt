AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Unidentified Flying Object, Palmyra, Pennsylvania 
25 August 1952

SUMMARY: (Summarize the contents of the report in one or two paragraphs. Include in the summary any definite conclusions or opinions expressed by the author or authors of the report. Omit details and descriptive material covered in succeeding paragraphs.)

Witness reported sighting a "mysterious object" which was described as a cigar-shaped object with a white light attached and a red light flashing on the rear. Object was observed for about 15 minutes and was estimated to be about 1,500 feet in the air. Three other witnesses also reported seeing the object. The investigator concluded that the object was most likely a weather balloon, but could not definitely identify it.

DETAILS: (Give details of the sighting, investigation, and conclusions as contained in the report. Include such items as date, time, location, description of object, direction and speed of travel, duration of sighting, weather conditions, names of witnesses, methods of observation, and any other pertinent data.)

On 25 August 1952 at 2210 hours, John L. Spitsbergen, Palmyra, Pennsylvania, reported sighting an unidentified flying object. Spitsbergen stated that he and three other persons observed a "mysterious object" which appeared to be cigar-shaped, with a white light attached and a red flashing light on the rear. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes and was estimated to be about 1,500 feet in the air. 

Three other witnesses also reported seeing the object. The investigator concluded that the object was most likely a weather balloon, but could not definitely identify it. The weather at the time was clear with 15 mile visibility.

This office can offer no definite explanation as to the identity of the object. It would appear that a weather balloon is still a strong possibility.
