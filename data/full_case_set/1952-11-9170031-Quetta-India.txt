‘FLYING SAUCERS’ OVER BALUCHISTAN!!

"QUETTA, November 18: Tribesmen saw “flying saucers trailing bluish flames’’ roar across the evening skies of Baluchistan on two successive days last week, according to reports reaching here. 

The reports said the “saucers” were first seen darting across the sky at Lora Lugti in the Sibi district and brilliantly lit an area of between 30 and 40 miles radius with a dazzling beam.

Several months ago two plots of the Pakistan air force reported seeing similar “objects” high above Karachi. - PTI."
