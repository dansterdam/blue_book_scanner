ATIC Capability for Investigating Sightings of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

AFOIN-4X6 THRU: AFOIN-4X

1. On 15 July 1960, a briefing was held at the Department of Defense for members of the House Armed Forces Committee, House Science and Astronautics Committee and U.S. Air Force Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Program, and resulted from a recent interest in the activities of the briefing, which was the subject of the hearing before the House Armed Services and Science and Astronautics Committees. The Air Force disclosed that the Air Force investigations of UFO sightings left something to be desired.

2. Mr Robert Smart of the Armed Forces Committee stated that the Air Force should have been more informative in supplying details, particularly the area of investigation. This was corrected at the briefing when the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center should investigate those cases which give indication of intelligence or scientific, and also those which have an unusual amount of public interest.

3. It is estimated that 12,000 cases each year would require investigation by ATIC. It is further estimated that the cost of investigating these sightings will average $200,000 per year. It is hoped that utilization of space available military aircraft will reduce the cost of investigating, and allow an extended capability.

4. Investigations of significant cases of sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena, from the standpoint of qualified personnel, is within the capability of AFOIN-4X.

5. It is requested that $300,000 be available to AFOIN-4X for the purpose of investigating significant cases of unidentified aerial phenomena.

6. At the briefing it was decided that ATIC would be provided with an intelligence capability directly from the Secretary of the Air Force. Appropriate accounting symbols to be requested by telephone.

1. During July 1960, ATIC participated in a briefing on the Air Force Sub-Committee following the briefing Mr Robert Smart of the House Armed Services Sub-Committee made several recommendations directed at improving the capability of the Air Force to investigate significant sightings.

AFCIN-4X4 All of the recommendations that were made with reference to improving the UFO program have been affected with one exception, the establishment of an additional officer to the UFO Branch to assist with the investigation of reports.

AFCIN-4X5 ATIC has accomplished what we feel is a better solution, the establishment of a special study group of four officers to assist, on a full time basis, those officers with the problem. The UFO investigation requirement is cyclic and more expeditions basic than one officer further, the officers selected for this duty have backgrounds in Meteorology, astronomy, and electronic requirements.

Major Tacker, SAFOI-3d, Hq, USAF, Washington, D. C. called Major Friend 7 June 1960. Major Tacker indicated a very strong concern about an article on a "UFO" incident to be published in a forthcoming magazine article. His particular concern is with the lack of adequate investigation. Major Tacker feels that the next Legislative Hearing will be profitable to sit down with LGL and discuss the situation. The specific details we need for this concern was a case which was brought to the attention of a Virginia Congressman, and had not been reported to ATIC by APRO.

Major Tacker was concerned for Langley Air Force base incident as the fact that the witness was a chronic reporter of UFO's and they did not feel that the case was worthy of investigation.

The text in the document reads as follows:

AFD IN-4
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena 

Mr. USAF
(APCIN)
Washington 25, D. C.

1. On 4 December 1960, Brig Gen Leesley, USAF, arranged a meeting with Col. Gillily, Director of Information USAF, to discuss the dissemination of information to the news media concerning the investigation of certain these aerial observations reported to the Air Force. Following the meeting Col Gall instructed Major Prindle, USTH-4-25, to prepare a brief summary of the classified unidentified aerial phenomena program and to outline generally what would be required to bring the program in line with SAFOI's recommendation to be result of the meeting.  

2. For the past 13 years, the United States Air Force has been charged with the responsibility for investigating and analyzing reports of unidentified aerial phenomena. 

3. Air Force Regulation 200-2, dated 14 September 1959, charges the Air Force with overseeing and analyzing these reports. APIC is charged with the associated public relations and policy aspects, while the Air Force bases nearest the location of a specific sighting is responsible for reporting and investigation. 

4. In the United States there are more than 50 private organizations "investigating" unidentified aerial phenomena. Additionally, there are more than 500,000 members. For this reason, persons belonging to these organizations can contribute to confusing public, ignorance, or possibly the use the situation as a could war tool. The official position of the USAF is that no unidentified aerial phenomena can be proven to be extraterrestrial, and the Air Force is withholding information it has concerning them.

5. The most active and influential of these organizations is the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). This organization is headed by Major Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC (Ret.). He serves in an advisory capacity to Gen William F. McKee, Vice Chief of Staff, USAF, and General Curtis E. LeMay, former Chief of Staff, USAF, and is known to Congress (HAT) as members of its Board of Governors.

6. Strenuous efforts by Major Keyhoe and others to discredit the Air Force's handling of the UFO program have met reliable in the Congressmen.

1. A briefing on the Air Force Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Program was held with members of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Committee, House Space and Astronautics Committee and CIA on 15 July 1959. During this discussion, it was indicated that due to the usually limited technical capability of the Air Force bases involved, ATIC should continue the investigation on those cases wherein indications of hostile intent or technical surveillance are involved.

2. The ATIC Aerial Phenomena Group is presently staffed with one commissioned officer and one non-commissioned officer. To adequately conduct the additional function of investigation of significant sightings, this office requires the assignment of an additional officer.

3. It is estimated that it will cost $3,000 per year travel funds to implement this capability. 

4. The necessary action has been initiated at this level to obtain both the additional personnel and funds required to carry out this operation.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be an old document from the United States Air Force's Project Blue Book, a program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is a memorandum for the Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence, regarding "Unidentified Flying Objects".

The text in the document is as follows:

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

MEMORANDUM FOR ASSISTANT CHIEF OF STAFF, INTELLIGENCE
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

1. On Friday, 15 July, in Secretary Sharp's Conference Room, members of this Directorate, AFOIN and AFSC briefed the following Congressional Committees on the Air Force's UFO Project, the Science and Astronautics Committee of the House, and the Armed Services Committee of the House.

2. In addition to personnel from each of these Committees and this Headquarters, Lt. Dyke, of the Institute of History, and Major Friend of ATIC attended this briefing.

3. The Congressional Committees involved wanted reassurance from the Air Force concerning our position on unidentified flying objects because they have received a great deal of pressure from constituents demanding public hearings on this subject.

4. All personnel attending the briefing were pleased with the results and the general consensus is that no public hearings will be held in the near future.

5. However, this meeting and the informal discussions, which followed, gave the indication that congressional pressures may generate spontaneous public and Congressional interest. This publicity will, of course, involve USAF and other investigative personnel to visit the scene of a specific sighting and could, as a result, require the assignment of additional personnel to "Major Friend's" office, AFOIN, SAFLL, Dr. Hynek and ATIC personnel.

6. Therefore request your office support this recommendation and action be taken as soon as possible to implement this requirement.

AFCIN-P
1. During the week of 11-15 July 1960, briefings were held at Department of Defense and ATIC facilities and at the Air Defense Command and the Air Materiel Command concerning the investigation of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. During the course of these meetings, briefings were given to certain members of the Senate and House Committees concerned with this problem.

2. At a briefing on 13 July 1960, Mr. Stuart French of the Senate Committee on Preparedness pointed out that ATIC should have a capability to investigate those cases which give an indication of having a high intelligence or scientific potential, and also those which generate an unusually large number of public inquiries. Suggestions were made that the Atomic Energy Commission and Astronautics Committee, CIA, and Office of Secretary of the Air Force on 15 July 1960. Mr. Robert Smart, Chief of the Armed Services Committee, stated that the investigative capability of Air Force bases, as currently limited to preliminary investigations, should be expanded. This was taken to mean that the Aerial Phenomena Group of ATIC should have a higher priority assigned to the fact that for an interim period, financing of travel and communications with this program was required.

3. This additional function is estimated to involve 12 to 13 cases each year requiring investigation and subsequent reporting. This represents an activity of collecting and analyzing not within the present capability of ATIC staffed with one commissioned Officer and one non-commissioned officer. The assignment of an additional officer and would cost approximately $3,000 in travel funds.

4. It is requested that the additional personnel and funds be authorized. This request is being routed to AFCIN-P, since the representative at the meeting, Lt. Colonel Sullivan, expressed a willingness to coordinate in securing the additional resources necessary. The officer selected for the additional function would be an experienced Intelligence Officer with a background suitable for this type of activity.
