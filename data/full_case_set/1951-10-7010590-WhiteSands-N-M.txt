Four objects in formation and fourth object trailing behind. Appeared about size of newspaper that had been opened up, at first observer thought that it was amber, like light coming through window shades. Appeared to be square, but could not determine. First appeared 160 degrees, disappeared at 110 degrees. Speed estimated at twice as fast as rocket. No sound. Manner of disappearance, just vanished.

Evaluated as Astro (Meteor).

3. Place of observation: 0350.0-3350.4 Ten thousand Mies Universal JIK چگونه دهاد location (Map Coordinates) Zone 13, the last three digits of the grid numbers are omitted.

4. Position of observer (air, car, bldg, location or - give details):
Sitting on steps of the Military Office Building T-1065 which is located on the south end of the building.

6. Number of objects and sketch of formation or grouping: One (1) object.

7. Apparent size (compare to known object, i.e., sun, moon, thumb or fist at arms length): About ten (10) foot long, width undetermined. Appeared to lengthen and then get shorter. Had a halo around it which was an illumination.
8. Color of object: Aluminum, could not determine the color. Never did see any thing like it before. But about the same color as when one rubs a suit in this.

9. Shape (Give graphic description - compare with known objects): Long and slender like a rocket.

10. Altitude (Angle of elevation above horizon - 0° at horizon, 90° overhead):
Came in about 20 degrees and when online with observer was about 45 degrees.

11. Direction from observer (Angle clockwise from north): First observed at 110 degrees and disappeared at about 40 degrees.

12. Distance from observer (distance to town, bldg, etc., over which object appeared to be): Appeared to be over one thousand yards away (231 miles distant).

13. Direction of flight of object (s): First observed traveling North-West. When object was North-East in relation to observer, object appeared to turn up on line North, rising elevation at an angle of about 15 degrees.

14. Time in sight: Fifteen (15) seconds

15. Speed (time to cover given angular distance): Estimated five (5) times as fast as any rocket that has been fired at HSSMC.

16. Sound and odor: None

17. Trail (color, length, width, persistence, etc.) None

18. Luminosity (visible by reflection, incandescence, other * degree of brilliance): Glow around object, which appeared to be halo.

19. Projectians (fins, wings, rods, antennae, canopies, etc.): None

20. Maneuvers (turns, climbs, descent, changes in speed and/or path): Changed from direction of travel increased elevation, about 15 degrees.
