Subject: Unidentified aircraft reported 14 November 1950

1. In answer to request for information contained in the first endorsement under paragraph (a):

a. With regard to size and shape, the pip was slightly smaller than that of a B-29. The intensity of the pip was very weak similar to that of a B-29.

b. No track is available as the radar pipe were very weak and no recording was made. The officers generally monitoring in the vicinity of the interface at which the unidentified aircraft was detected could not recognize any definite track which was undoubtedly familiar to them. The contact was maintained for approximately 5 minutes.

c. Radar S/X General purpose search radar with a frequency of 2970 Mc.

d. AN/APS-6 airborne intercept radar (X band).

e. Negative, the PPI-APS4 that made the visual contact was the blacked-out over SJIB-3534 which made the radar contact. The teletype radar contact was made on the unidentified aircraft by the interceptor radar AN/APS-6. Temporary radar contacts were made by the ground radar over a period of about 5 minutes.

f. No surface targets, ship or land, were in the vicinity.

c. Momentary contact was made, but not enough of a trace or pattern observed to be able to determine its character.
d. No OCT was attempted due to the limitations explained in 1 above.
3. Evaluation of the appearance of the radar pip plus the visual sighting involved a jet type aircraft of the appearance indicated and carrying lights. This was confirmed by subsequent OCT to find the identity of the flight. The altitude of the flight was well within the 12,000 to 14,000 feet range, the lights on an aircraft, passing through the airspace warning area.

TITLE: Sighting of Rockets on 18 November 1949 at 0345 Hours Greenwich Civil Time over Santa Monica, California

SYNOPSIS: This is an initial report.

Three officers of the 374th Reconnaissance Squadron (VLR) Weather, McChord Air Force Base, McChord, California, while airborne on a routine weather reconnaissance flight, sighted what appeared to be rockets at 0345 hours Pacific Standard Time, on 18 November 1949. From an altitude of 13,000 feet, the object was sighted at approximately 49 degrees north latitude, 121 degrees west longitude, a great rate of speed on a heading of 270 degrees. When first observed it was at an altitude of approximately 19,000 feet and disappeared in a layer of clouds with tops at 14,000 feet. The object appeared to leave a trail of flame about 20 feet in length, and accelerated to an estimated 10 seconds. No unusual disturbances in radio transmissions or reception. Radar not operating at time of sighting.

AT MC CLELLAN AIR FORCE BASE, MC CLELLAN, CALIFORNIA

On 18 November 1949, Captain Richard L. Kirkland, Reconnaissance Squadron (VIR), Weather, Mc Clellan Air Force Base, California, made the following statement relative to an unusual sighting on 18 November 1949:

"Friday November 18th 1949 on Lark Dog mission, I sighted what appeared to be a reddish colored, disc-shaped object, at approximately 12:20 - 12:25 hours, at a maximum altitude of approximately 18,000 feet at 0240 GOT. We sighted what appeared to be a reddish object traveling at a great rate of speed. It appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet traveling at a slight descending heading of 270 degrees. I called the object to the attention of the pilot, but the object disappeared in the cumulus clouds in a few seconds."

2. On 21 November 1949, First Lieutenant, DELETED, Reconnaissance Squadron (VIR) Weather, Mc Clellan Air Force Base, California, made the following statement relative to an unusual sighting on 18 November 1949:

"On 18 November 1949, 1840 hours Pacific Time, I observed what appeared to be either a rocket or a highly maneuverable generally westerly heading. The object was traveling at a great rate of speed and trailing a flame which was extremely bright, its speed and trailing flame made it impossible to estimate accurately. It appeared to be our same altitude or slightly lower and either burned out or disappeared into a layer of clouds."

DETAILS: (Cont'd)

Pilot: On 21 November 1949, First Lieutenant, 4th Reconnaissance Squadron (VLR) Weather, McGellan Air Force Base, McGellan, California, made the following statement relative to an unusual sighting on 18 November 1949:

"On the 18th of November 1949 during a routine Dark Dew Weather mission, I sighted an unusual light.

At about 1940 hours Pacific Time in the evening, a brilliant light appeared through the sky from a heading of approximately 270°.

The aircraft, at the time, was on a heading of 140°. I, the weather observer, was the first man to notice the unusual phenomenon and called Lt. McClellan's attention to it, who in turn notified me. When I did look out the window, I saw a brilliant light shaped somewhat like a large cigar on a downward path heading toward the ocean. However, the light was suddenly extinguished in about 10 seconds.

I have no idea of what the light may have been. At first I thought it might have been a falling star, but the phenomenon lasted such a long time and the light was so large in relation to falling stars, that I eliminated the possibility of its being a meteor. I dismissed the possibility of
it being refraction or reflection, since there was no unusual interference with radio transmission or reception during the flight.

5. On 3 January 1950, Staff Sergeant, Weather, McClellan Air Force Base, McClellan Air Force Base, California, stated he had been on a Dark Dew mission on 18 November 1949, but could give no information relative to the object sighted.

"NOTE: The position is located in the rear pressurized compartment of the aircraft. There are blinders located on both sides of the compartment and one on top, but no forward visibility.

6. On 13 January 1950, Staff Sergeant, Radio Operator, 4th Reconnaissance Squadron (VLR) Weather, McClellan Air Force Base, McClellan, California, stated he had been on a Dark Dew mission on 18 November 1949, but could give no information relative to the object sighted, since there had been no unusual interference or disruption of radio transmission or reception during the flight."

McGillan Air Force Base, McClellan, California, stated he had been on Lark Dog mission on 18 November 1949 but could give no information relative to the object sighted by lieutenant Major, since he operated the equipment to leaving the detached on Lark Dog mission and was not operating at the time of alleged sighting.

8. On 19 January 1950, *****, First Lieutenant, USAF, Navigator, Reconnaissance Squadron (VLR) weather, McGillan
Air Force Base, McClellan, California, stated he had been on Lark Dog mission on 18 November 1949, but could give no information relative to the object observed, since he plotted the position of the aircraft at the time of sighting but due to his poor position which is located aft of the pilots, had not seen the object reported.

1. This command has reviewed the included report and it is considered that the unidentified targets observed on the nights of 14 and 15 November 1950 appear to be possibly correct.

2. In general, insufficient information is contained in the attached report to allow a well-founded evaluation to be made of the radar targets. It is suspected that the sources of the basic report be requested to submit another more complete and coordinated report. Answers to the following questions are desired:

(1) Did the radar scope pips of the unidentified target detected by the ground radar set resemble those of a conventional aircraft? If so, what type or size conventional aircraft?

(2) Can a track of the unidentified target be supplied to this command? If not, are complete details as possible regarding range and maneuvers of the target, and contiguity of the radar target echoes.

(3) What type ground radar set was used to detect the target? Was the frequency of the transmitter particularly what was the frequency of the transmitters?

(4) What type radar set was used in the intercepting F5F-5N?

(5) Was the F5F-5N that made visual contact with an unidentified airborne object the same as the one that had previously made a radar contact on the unidentified target? Also, was radar contact made on the sighted aircraft either before or after visual sighting by the F5F-5N or the ground radar?
