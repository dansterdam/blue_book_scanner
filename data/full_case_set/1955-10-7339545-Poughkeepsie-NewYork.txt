Chief Pilot 10-3-55

SEPTEMBER 27 - OCTOBER 2, 1955

As Captain on Calendar's Trip 27 of the 2nd of October 1955, the following occurred:

On Sept 30 at 1916 CDT, while in the climb out from St. Cloud, Minnesota, airspeed indicator read 190 knots, altimeter 6500 feet. The aircraft climbed to 13,000 feet, after which the airspeed indicator went off scale (over 250 knots) and did not return until the aircraft reached approximately 10 to 15 thousand feet. The engine instruments were normal and the pilot reported no power change. The aircraft appeared to be free and easier to handle than normal at the high airspeed. It is not known what caused this extremely high airspeed indication. It was reported and is a matter of record.

I was unable to make contact with the Control Tower at my destination on the normal radio frequencies. After several attempts, the first contact was made on 122.2, the standard emergency frequency, at which time the tower advised that they had been unable to contact me on the normal tower frequencies. The ground station was very weak on my arrival, and I had difficulty in maintaining contact.
