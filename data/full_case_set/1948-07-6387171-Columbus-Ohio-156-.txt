The image provided is of poor quality and information is quite difficult to discern. It appears to be a photocopy or scan of a document with substantial portions redacted or blurred out, making it a challenge to read the text accurately.

No photographs are present in this image. Due to the quality of the image, I am unable to accurately transcribe all the text. However, I can attempt to provide a transcription of some visible portions:

INCIDENT #156
DATE OF INFO.  31 May 19[rest is indistinct]
Local Time
ATC ID. [Redacted]
LOC.    Columbus, Ohio
SOURCE. [Redacted] Civilians

That portion of text appears to be part of a form or report with various fields for information input. The lack of clarity and significant redaction in the image does not allow for a complete transcription.
