The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a cover page or title page for a document related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page reads:

File 3687
late July to early August
1955
Mulberry Corners , Ohio
2 photos

The image appears to contain two photographs. The larger one shows a rural landscape with a building in the distance, while the smaller one shows some trees and power lines silhouetted against the sky.

The text accompanying the images describes the general height of the trees in the area where the Shene man sighting took place. It states that the UFO was first seen and traversed its course at tree top level, with an estimated altitude of traverse of 60 to 100 feet.

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

THESE PICTURES SHOW THE GENERAL HEIGHT OF THE
TREES IN THE AREA WHERE SHENE MAN SIGHTING TOOK PLACE.

THE UFO WAS FIRST SEEN AND DID TRAVERSE ITS COURSE
AT TREE TOP LEVEL, ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF TRAVERSE 60 TO
100 FT.
