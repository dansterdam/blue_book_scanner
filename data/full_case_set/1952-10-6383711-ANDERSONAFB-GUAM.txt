APRIL 28, 1952 - C/0 - NAVAL AIR STATION, Fillmore, California

30 October 1952

SUBJECT: AIRCRAFT OBJECTS OR PHENOMENON OBSERVED
ANDERSON AIR FORCE BASE, GUAM

1. The following report is submitted as requested. At approximately 1315 on 27 September 1952, the attention of the undersigned was directed to a strange phenomenon in the sky over Anderson Air Force Base, Guam.

2. On the evening of 29 September 1952, 1 was on duty in the control tower at Anderson Air Force Base, Guam, when my attention was directed to a strange object which appeared to be in the vicinity of the airbase at approximately 30,000 feet elevation.

3. The object appeared to be approximately four or five times the size of a B-29 or B-50 type aircraft and was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed. It was observed for a period of less than 30 seconds and appeared to be traveling in a straight line at a tremendous rate of speed, and then disappeared from view.

4. It was clearly observable and appeared to be a metallic or highly reflective type of object. No lights or other identifying marks were discernible. The only sound which was noticeable was a very low frequency "hum" or vibration which could barely be detected.

5. I contacted the Radar Section locally and the Director of Operations was advised, but the object had disappeared from view before it could be tracked on the radar.

6. There was no visible means of propulsion and the speed at which the object was traveling precluded its being any known type of aircraft in our inventory. The object was observed at other times subsequent to this incident but never with the clarity as on this occasion.

7. I can't testify to the operation, and asked the director to make the determination to have the object investigated.

1950th AACS Squadron, 350-69. Subject: Sighting of Strange Objects or Light

Pilot of the T-6 calls me when he closed his flight plan. Lt. Cumings, the pilot, gave me his information, which I have entered in paragraph 8.

8. About 2245 hours I again observed the light at a much greater distance with less intensity of light. It was soon gone from sight.

9. In the great intensity of light I could see its shape as it moved, as described in paragraph 8, which was an unusual shape and clearly dropped in a vertical direction out of sight in a time period of about 5 minutes.

10. While observing the light I noticed that it slightly changed in color varying from a bright white to a yellowish orange then back to white.

11. Individuals who saw the light were in Ground Control, Weathers, Rotan Tower, 2d Aviation, Anderson Tower and others from whom I received phone calls.

12. I have been in Anderson Tower for six months but have never witnessed any similar conditions.

13. I am convinced that the light was not any type of man-made aircraft, balloon, flare, meteor or star.

14. If this light was housed in any type structure I am unable to describe it.

15. Lt. Cumings, pilot of the T-6, called the tower on a second instance reporting that he had again seen an identical light to the south as he lost the operations.

16. I received reports of other "strange lights" after the light in question was observed, but I believe there were only three, since I was unable to see it.

17. I am not an advocate of interplanetary "saucers" and in writing this report am only describing something a strange occurrence which I witnessed and am unable to account for.

SUBJECT: Sighting of strange object or light

TO: Squadron Intelligence Officer

1. The following report is submitted as regards the sighting of a strange light or object in the vicinity of Anderson Air Force Base on the night of 6 October 1952.

2. At 1915 hours on the night of the 6th of October a lighted object was observed in the night sky, which was described as "low, swooping and swerving". The object being sighted from Anderson's control tower on the runway. It maneuvered for about five minutes and then disappeared into the fog and was not too for from our runway.

3. After a careful study through the binoculars, I/3e Tower and myself agreed that the object was stationary and had a slightly change from an orange glow to rcd as it remained in the same position. It could not be an aircraft or a balloon or even a meteor due to its stationary position.

4. He had a 2-6 flying in the local area, his number being 167 and the control tower being in communication. 

5. We asked 167 if he had the object in sight. He verified our transmission and stated 2'17 to the object and turn his landing lights on at, which he did and his statement was that the object was around 2000 feet high and not too far from our runway.

6. The pilot of 167 also did not know what it was and at 1940 hours the object disappeared and at 1945 hours the object had disappeared from our sight.

7. During that thirty minutes we had verified target by Control. Operations and GCA. They said the object was too low for their scopes.

8. The above is what I consider the incident.

UNCLASSIFIED
HEADQUARTERS
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT CHIEF OF STAFF, INTELLIGENCE

TO: Charles W. Gettings
DATE: Oct 6, 1952

This office time was alerted 7 Oct 52. After initiating off was a fruitless observation of an object in the sky at approximately 2300 hours 6 Oct 52.
The object observed appeared to have an intense but pulsating light which maneuvered in a manner which would be impossible for any known aircraft, staying in a hovering position, making sharp turns, and rapidly gaining or losing altitude for periods of approximately ten (10) seconds.
The object was under observation for approximately thirty (30) minutes after which time it suddenly disappeared. There was no sound emanating from the object and on one or two occasions it seemed to generate or exhibit a light similar to a cigarette being dragged. All personnel observing the object were of the opinion that the object was some type of unidentified flying object, the size of which was estimated to be approximately ten (10) feet in diameter.

SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF STRANGE OBJECTS OR LIGHTS

TO : CHAIRMAN, INTELLIGENCE OFFICER

1. The following report is submitted as results the sighting of a strange object in the sky on the night of 7 October 1952.

On 7 October 1952, at approximately 2030 hours, I was on duty at the Anderson Control Tower at Anderson Air Force Base. While on duty, I observed a strange object in the sky. This object appeared to be approximately 7 to 9 miles to the west of the Anderson Control Tower. The object was first observed to the west, at approximately 30 to 45 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be circular in shape, with a reddish-orange glow surrounding it. The object remained stationary for approximately 8 to 10 minutes, and then began to move in a northerly direction at a very rapid rate of speed. The object was observed to move across the sky for a distance of approximately 30 to 45 degrees, and then it appeared to stop and hover again for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The object then began to move in a southerly direction at the same rapid rate of speed, and continued this path of flight for approximately 30 to 45 degrees across the sky. The object then appeared to stop and hover again for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. This pattern of flight was repeated 3 times, with the object moving in a northerly direction, stopping and hovering, then moving in a southerly direction, stopping and hovering, and then repeating this pattern. 

The total time of the sighting was approximately 30 minutes. The object was very bright and clearly visible, and there was no noise or trail of any kind associated with the object. The sky was clear, with a few scattered clouds, and the visibility was excellent.

I immediately reported the sighting to the Anderson Control Tower, and the Air Force officials on duty were notified. They concurred with my observations, and indicated that they had also observed the strange object. They further stated that they had no explanation for the object, and that they were unable to identify it.

I have submitted this report in accordance with the instructions contained in Air Force Regulation 200-2, concerning the reporting of unidentified flying objects. I trust that this report will be of assistance in the investigation of this incident.

Performing OCR on the text:

This is the light said to be a much lower intensity and appeared to be a strange luminous objects very rapid motion. The object was first observed at approximately 12:25 am and disappeared very shortly before reaching the horizon.

As per the description of the strange light, there was an impression of a sharp outline or edge that remained very steady and constant during the period of observation. The light appeared to be spherical in shape and was emitting its own illumination which varied little in intensity. The light was moving at a fairly high rate of speed and disappeared from view in a south-easterly direction. The light had no "tail" or exhaust and appeared to be self-luminous. The size was estimated to be approximately 2-3 inches in diameter as observed at the horizon.

The light had no "vapor" around it and it was round. The size could be referred to as the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length.
