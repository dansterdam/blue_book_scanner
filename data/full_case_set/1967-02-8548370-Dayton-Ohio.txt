9. CONCLUSION: (A) SIGHTING - The moon was on an azimuth of approximately 235 degrees and an elevation of approximately 10 degrees. The moon was shining on an azimuth of approximately 270 degrees or to the west. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A BRIGHT ORANGE-COLORED OBJECT IN THE EASTERN SKY. ONE OBSERVER COMPARED THE COLOR TO THAT OF A TRAFFIC SIGNAL. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY HOWEVER, IT WAS LATER DETERMINED THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOVING TOWARD THE NORTH. CLOUDS PERMITTED A GOOD VIEW OF THE OBJECT BUT LATER A LIGHT HAZE SEEMED TO PARTLY OBSCURE IT. THE OBJECT WAS NOT OBSERVED DIRECTLY IN THE EAST AND WAS LIKE A BIG STAR.

The image contains a diagram consisting of a compass and instructions related to sketching the path of an observed object. There is no photograph present in this image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "D" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? [Handwritten answer: 5 or 6]. Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The image does not contain any photographs, only a scanned document from Project Blue Book. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract and output all the text found in the document:

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before. If so give date or dates and location.
31. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? (Circle One) Yes No
31.1 IF you answered YES, did they see the object too? (Circle One) Yes No
31.2 Please list their name and addresses:

32. Please give the following information about yourself:
NAME  Last Name   First Name   Middle Name
ADDRESS  Street   City   Zone   State  
TELEPHONE NUMBER  AGE  SEX 
Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experience, which might be pertinent.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?
Day   Month   Year

The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a page from a document with handwritten text responding to a questionnaire. I will now proceed to extract the text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:   8  Day    Feb   Month   1967   Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The handwritten text appears to be an explanation provided in response to the questionnaire. It describes the details of a sighting, though the specifics are not clear from the text alone.
