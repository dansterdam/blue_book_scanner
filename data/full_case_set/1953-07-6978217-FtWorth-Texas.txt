1. Information was received on this subject from an employee of Convair, Department of Manufacturing, Port Worth, Texas, who realized at approximately 2115 hours, 2 July 1953, he had observed an activity of a peculiar nature in the sky southwest from the church in which he was located in preparation to leave.

2. He advised that at approximately 2115 hours, 2 July 1953, he observed at the Church Building in Fort Worth, Texas, a light phenomenon which appeared to be a short distance and again changed course to a southwesterly direction. The color of this light, hazy light, was visible for approximately three (3) or four (4) seconds and was unable to determine its nature. He advised it to be at the same altitude as normal aircraft in the area, however, it differed in that it was not blinking lights, as is normal aircraft, but rather had a steady glow which could be attributed to the flying saucer phenomenon. He stated that three (3) other persons were present at the time and saw the light, and whom he understands reside in the Halton City community adjacent to the church.

Transcribed text from the document:

"UNCLASSIFIED
17 July 1953

Please be advised that approximately 2315 hours, 3 July 1953, I just happened to observe an object or a blaze of peculiar light traveling in the sky or towards the air within my field of vision from my home. The object appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length and moved swiftly across the sky in a southerly direction. It appeared to be emitting a bright light and had a long trail of light behind it that made it distinguishable as something unusual. The object maintained this course of travel for an estimated 8 to 10 seconds. The object then appeared to make a sharp turn to the right and continued to travel in a westerly direction. During the time that I observed the object it appeared to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed in relation to any aircraft that I have ever observed. After the object made the sharp turn to the right it disappeared from my field of vision. I would estimate the total period of observation to be around 15 to 20 seconds.
