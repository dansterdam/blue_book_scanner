"Elgin Air Force Base
Rocket Firing Division.

Dear Sirs:

I do not know whether you are the proper authorities to inform or not, but here goes -

On the evening of July 16th, I noticed a bright light up in the sky. Observing it with the 50 binoculars, I surmised it was another object with an intensity of about 1000 diametes.  When it was directly overhead, it disappeared from view. The only visual the sun's rays gave to be true to earth also that would be the last we would of.

The next night out of curiosity, my brother's nephews looked up in the sky. same time and place and we were silent. Unable to find it.

It would say it was about 3/10 miles in space, it was at least three times smaller than the one previously, which the papers said was about 450 feet long.

Usually, a balloon shot only lasts for a day or four days, we though we would like to know. Any other information you would also be glad to give you.  Would also an answer to confirm the receipt of this letter.

Yours truly,
[Signature]
Babylon, N.Y."
