The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed report from the Headquarters Air Division (SAGE) of the United States Air Force, dated November 15, 1960, regarding an additional information on a UFO sighting near Douglasville, Georgia.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: 320IN

SUBJECT: Additional Information - UFO Sighting

TO: ATIC (AFCIN-4E2X)
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO

1. Reference is made to message AFCIN-4E2X 11-3209-S, 31 October 1960 Request for Additional Information on UFO Sighting near Douglasville, Georgia.

2. The three reported objects were not observed at the same time. There were various numbers of objects observed at the same time; object number two initially observed approximately three to four later.

3. Had they all been observed at the same time, their positions relative to each other would be approximate 1/4 - 1 for diagram.

4. Source stated that the objects were much brighter than any star in the sky, possibly ten times as bright as the evening star. He could not compare it to the moon since the moon was not out.

5. Elevation and azimuth of objects when first and last seen were:
a. Object number one: Appeared forty degrees above the western horizon bearing two seven zero degrees. Disappeared over horizon.
b. Object number three: Appeared thirty degrees above southern horizon bearing one hundred eighty degrees. Disappeared over horizon.
c. Object number two: Appeared fifty or fifty-five degrees above western horizon bearing two seven zero degrees. Disappeared over horizon.

6. Path of all objects was away from observer in general straight line, with occasional dance-like movements.

7. Weather Data:
a. 29 September 1960

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn diagram or schematic. It does not show any photographs. The diagram appears to depict the observation of some kind of unidentified flying object (UFO) or aerial phenomenon.

The text in the image reads:

I.P.: POINT OF INITIAL APPEARANCE.
V.P.: POINT OF DISAPPEARANCE OVER M___ DEGREES ARE STATED IN ELEVATION ABOVE HORIZON.

The diagram shows various angles and coordinates, including N, NW, W, S, and elevation angles. There is an "I.P." (Initial Point) and "V.P." (Vanishing Point) marked on the diagram, along with various angular measurements.
