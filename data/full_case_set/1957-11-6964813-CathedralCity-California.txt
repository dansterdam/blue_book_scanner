II. INCIDENT AND EVENTS:
1. At 1610 hours PST 30 November 1957, SOURCE was standing on the sun deck of her apartement in Cathedral City, California, when an object hovered above the trees approximately 300 to 500 feet distant.

SOURCE stated that she first observed the object approximately 15 seconds before it disappeared.
2. SOURCE stated that the object was hovering and had no visible means of propulsion. It gave off no sound and had no visible exhaust. The object appeared to be a metallic silver in color. The object was in view for approximately four (4) seconds.
3. Weather was described as clear and calm. The object was similar to the silhouette of a light airplane. URCE stated that the object appeared to be revolving, or rotating as it hovered.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Dr. A. 1306TH AISS

STATEMENT:
From a south-westerly direction, a group of objects traveling at high speed and at a high altitude was observed. The objects were round in shape, about the size of a half dollar when held at arm's length. There were about 4 or 5 objects and they seemed to be traveling in formation. The objects were a whitish color and all agreed it was not something natural.

The next morning we tried to find the objects again, looking through a telescope, but were unable to locate them. The observers stated that they were certain of what they saw.

A radio observer at the Lockheed Aircraft plant in Cathedral City, California listened to radio conversations on the USAF aircraft radio-telephone channels at approximately 5:45 am on the morning of 6 November 1957. The observer stated that the pilots of an aircraft flying over the area were discussing the fact that they were observing an unidentified aerial object. The object was described as being larger than the aircraft the pilots were flying, and it was maneuvering at a high rate of speed near their plane. The pilots discussed trying to get closer to the object to investigate it, but the object then accelerated and disappeared from view at a high rate of speed. The observer stated that the pilots appeared to be quite excited over the incident. This statement is being forwarded for information purposes.

PART FOUR: COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

Conclusion as to the description of the object: The preparing of this report was unable to arrive at a definite conclusion as to the classification or description of the object. It was observed from one point and the description at that point was that it appeared to be a bird. Subsequent investigation indicates that it may have been a local aircraft in the vicinity that was unidentified for the period that it was under observation.

Aircrews arriving at landing field at National Springs airport were in the near vicinity of the observation and the description as having caused the sighting. Although the airport was contacted for flight checks, a local control could have been made without a record at that airport indicative of that activity.
