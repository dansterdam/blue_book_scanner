DATE June 13, 1961

In December of 1952 I was training to try out at school in St Augustine Florida. A few week school starting in January of 1953.
Each night I would run 5 miles as part of my training. I had just pulled up to a walk after running and to my right (west) I saw the Saucer in one place for about 10 seconds. There were 5 or 6 windows lit up inside with white light. The Saucer outer rim was spinning and I could hear its hum, the Saucer had a blue glow and a bluish flame was burning at the rear of the Saucer. Then the bluish flame turned to a big bright red flame and the Saucer shot up and clear across the sky at a terrific speed. This is the whole truth and so will take any -action at any time.

President of the United States
John F. Kennedy
Mr. President,

In the night of December 1952 on our farm near Memphis Michigan I saw a flying saucer, when I first spotted the saucer it was about 200 ft. up and about 250 ft. away, it was in one place for about 10 seconds, I was very close to it as I could see the outer rim flying and hear its' system 
there were about 6 windows with white lights on their was a blue flame coming from its rear then the flame changed to a bright red and it swept clear across the sky at a terrific speed and out of sight in about 4 seconds.

I do not belive the saucer was made on earth, Russia or the United States would be far more advanced in space science then they are today. Am I right? if so is the planet known?
Mr. President I am sure you know a great deal more on this subject than I do.

Of all the people I have told no one believes me, and I must omit that if some one told me the same thing I too would not

- believe it, as a matter of fact I do not even believe any part of the Bible my self.

One thing sure the saucer I seen and herd is real, I would stake my life on this any time, Mr. President even though the public is kept in the dark, I would very much like to know more about this subject, and I would keep it to my self as long as I was told to.

Sincerely
