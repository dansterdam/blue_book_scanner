Observer watched two amber colored objects ascend and descend on a vertical plane. The objects were going on and off like a light being turned off. Each object ascended and descended rapidly. This description is consistent with that of an astronomical observation. The investigating officer concludes that the sighting was caused by various astronomical phenomena.

Dear [REDACTED],

Reference your correspondence regarding your unusual observation in early January 1967, without additional information, I hesitate to make any type of explanation at this time. If you had reported the observation to the nearest Air Force installation shortly after you observed the phenomenon, a meaningful scientific investigation would have been possible.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this document. The document appears to be a written report of a UFO sighting.

As requested, here is the full text of the document:

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,

THIS IS TO REPORT THE SIGHTING OF AN 
UNUSUAL LIGHT PHENOMENON IN THE SKY.

PLACE: ISLAMORADA, IN THE FLORIDA KEYS, ON THE BEACH OF THE MOTEL 
LA JOLLA WHERE I WAS VACATIONING.

TIME: I EITHER THE 5TH THE 7TH OR THE 8TH OF JANUARY 1957 - I DO
NOT REMEMBER EXACTLY. AT ABOUT 8:30 AT NIGHT.

DESCRIPTION:

I WAS ALONE, LOUNGING IN A BEACH CHAIR (RECLINING) AND LOOKING AT THE 
SKY OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND THE STARS SHINING 
BRIGHTLY, EXCEPT FOR A FEW SMALL AND VERY VAPOROUS CLOUDS SCATTERED
HERE AND THERE AND PUSHED BY A BLOW EASTERLY WIND.

I WAS TRYING TO FIND THE NORTH STAR. I FINALLY IDENTIFIED - OR THOUGHT
I IDENTIFIED - CASSIOPEIA. IT TOOK ME A FEW SECONDS TO UNDERSTAND ITS
UNUSUAL POSITION: I HAD NOT REALIZED THAT, SINCE I HAD COME 2000 MILES
SOUTH OF QUEBEC, THE ANGLE OF THE NORTH STAR WITH THE HORIZON WAS 
GREATLY DIFFERENT AT ISLAMORADA.

SUDDENLY, 15 OR 20° SOUTH OF CASSIOPEIA AND 20 OR 25° ABOVE THE HORIZON,
I SAW A LIGHT MOVING UPWARDS, WHICH I TOOK FOR A SHOOTING STAR, JUST A
LITTLE BIGGER THAN A SHOOTING STAR. THE COLOR OF WHICH WAS WHITE WITH
A GREENISH HUE. AT ABOUT 15° ABOVE THE HORIZON, THE LIGHT JERKED SUDDENLY
TO MY RIGHT AND TRAVELLED MORE OR LESS NORTH, AT A RIGHT ANGLE WITH ITS
PREVIOUS DIRECTION, FOR ABOUT 25°, THEN JERKED SUDDENLY AGAIN IN A
NORTH OR LESS NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION, WENT DOWN FOR ABOUT 15 OR 20° AND
DISAPPEARED.

- page 17 -

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from the "Universite Laval" (Laval University) in Quebec, Canada, discussing the observation of a light moving in the sky in a fashion similar to that of a "shooting star". The text describes the witness's perspective and impressions of the observed phenomenon, including details about the motion, beam of light, and the witness's inability to determine the distance of the object. The text also mentions the witness sharing the experience with others at a motel. Overall, this appears to be a first-hand account or report related to an unidentified aerial phenomenon.

The text of the document is as follows:

THE WHOLE THING LASTED ONLY A FEW SECONDS, 5 OR 6, PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE. THE SPEED WAS ABOUT THAT OF A SHOOTING STAR.

I HAD NEVER SEEN A LIGHT MOVING IN SUCH A FASHION IN THE SKY. THE NEAREST MOVEMENT I KNOW OF WOULD BE THAT OF THE BEAM OF A SEARCHLIGHT IN THE CLOUDS - I MEAN THE END OF THE BEAM, THERE WAS NO SHAFT OF LIGHT IN THIS CASE AS IN THE CASE OF A SEARCHLIGHT. ANOTHER DIFFERENCE: AFTER THE FIRST TURN, WHERE A LITTLE LIGHT APPEARED IN THE MOTION OF THE LIGHT, WHICH LASTED TO THE END.

I THOUGHT THAT THE EXPLANATION OF A SEARCHLIGHT COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE PHENOMENON BECAUSE THE LIGHT WAS VISIBLE IN THE DARK SKY AS WELL AS BEFORE (?) A SMALL CLOUD. THINKING ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS, I REALLY COULD NOT TELL WHETHER THE LIGHT HAD PASSED BEHIND OR BEFORE THAT CLOUD, NOR COULD I REMEMBER WHETHER THE LUMINOUS BODY HAD CHANGED WHEN IT WAS BEFORE (OR BEHIND) THE CLOUD. MY IMPRESSION IS THAT I PERCEIVED NO DIFFERENCE SINCE IT IS ONLY WHEN ANALYZING THAT PHENOMENON THAT SUCH A QUESTION WAS RAISED IN MY MIND. I WOULD SAY THAT THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE NEARER THAN A SHOOTING STAR, BUT IT IS HARD TO EVALUATE ITS DISTANCE.

A ROCKET LAUNCHED FROM A SHIP WOULD HAVE HAD THE FLUTTERING MOTION I NOTICED DURING PART OF THE PHENOMENON, BUT IT WOULD NOT, AT LEAST IN MY KNOWLEDGE, MAKE SUCH JERKY TURNS.

I TOLD SOME PEOPLE AT THE MOTEL, WHO LISTENED WITH FRIENDLY INTEREST. I TOLD SOME FRIENDS ON MY RETURN HERE, WHO SAID THAT IF ONLY BADLY I HAD BEEN IN THE NEED OF A VACATION. IT IS TRUE THAT I NEEDED ONE BADLY, BEING VERY PHYSICALLY TIRED AT THE TIME.

THE PHENOMENON WAS CERTAINLY REAL, WHATEVER IT WAS, AND VERY CLEAR. I WAS LOUNGING, MOTIONLESS, WHEN IT STARTED; I JUST LOOKED AT IT WITHOUT MOVING. I WEAR GLASSES AND I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OBJECTS.

REPLY TO: 95B-OOT
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 9 Jan 67

TO: TEST/EEO

1. Reference your letter, subject same as above, dated 7 Feb 67.
2. We reached the conclusion that it "was an UFO sighting and not a misidentification of this nature" because it appeared on two different radar sets, operating on different frequencies, and then was sighted visually by an experienced pilot. (We) plotted it on our Radar Control. They called for verification to the 4351st ACCS at Lockbourne AFB. Both of these organizations are in the area. The possibility of its being an unknown aircraft cannot be completely ruled out, but it is a slim possibility in view of:
a. Lack of knowledge of any traffic by either control agency.
b. Our remoteness from population necessitates more stringent flight planning rules. 
3. The speed attributed to the object by the radar observer at the 551st ACW Squadron. He followed it for 12 sweeps on an AN/FPS-93 and estimated its speed during the first eight (8) sweeps to be 200 knots. During the last four (4) sweeps its speed was 2100 knots.

NICAP MASSACHUSETTS INVESTIGATING SUBCOMMITTEE
13 Friend Court
Waltham, Massachusetts 
SUBJECT: UFO Report - Mid-Jan 67 - Duxford, Mass. (3:00 AM EST)
DATE: 5 March 1967
FROM: R. E. Fowler, Chairman NICAP MASS SUBCOM
TO: Richard Hall, Assistant Director NICAP, Washington, D.C.

Enclosed is a report of a UFO sighting which took place on Mid-January 1967 at 3:00 AM EST in Duxford, Massachusetts. The sighting was investigated by NICAP MASS Investigator Richard H. Fowler.

Respectfully submitted,

SUMMARY UFO SIGHTING
(CONFIDENTIAL)

WITNESS: John Hoxtord
ADDRESS: Boxford, Mass.
PHONE: 

LOCATION OF SIGHTING: Ipswich Road, Boxford, Mass.
DATE: January 10, 1967
TIME: Approximately 7:00 AM
DURATION: Approximately 1 Minute

SIGHTING:
The witness noticed a red light coming up from the horizon and approaching his home. The object appeared at first as a flash in the kitchen window. The object appeared to be round, solid and silver in color with a white stripe about its midsection. The object displayed no lights. No sound was heard.
The object passed from the witness' line-of-sight at the kitchen window out of his living room to see if the object was now visible from this (the kitchen) window. He did not catch sight of the object which had apparently gone by this time. The witness then went outside to the kitchen window to see if he could see the object again, but it was gone.
The witness felt fairly certain that the total viewing time was about a minute. He did not seem to be able to judge the size of the object. Although he stated that the object was about the size of a Christmas ornament, the witness was uncertain of its actual size and distance. The object seemed to be traveling at high speed and at a high altitude. The witness was alone at the time and was not seeking publicity as he demands his name be kept confidential.

EVALUATION:
The witness struck me as being sober, intelligent and of average capability as an observer. He obviously was not seeking publicity as he demands his name be kept confidential.

quite truthfully his observation of something he could not identify.
His estimate of apparent size of the object, distance of the object, and estimate of the real size of the object do not coincide.  However, the most accurate information is that of the apparent azimuth and altitude of the object, which he estimates as not accurate.  The object, as described, is hard to explain as that of a conventional aircraft.

NICAP MASS INVESTIGATOR

CHAIRMAN'S NOTE
I checked on the reliability of the witness through a lawyer friend. He was considered very reliable and not the type who would instigate a hoax. It is interesting to note that the UFO sightings took place at H. Hansfield, Springfield, in which occurred during the middle of the afternoon in daylight, and is seen during the 6-12-13 January was observed quite distinctly. This is the same general area where other Unidentified Flying Objects have been occurring in February.
