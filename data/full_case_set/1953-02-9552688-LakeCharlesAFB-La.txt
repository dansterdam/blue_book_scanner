An unidentified object was observed by ten (10) crew members of the 52nd Bombardment Squadron, 66th Bombardment Wing, on 12 February 1953.

The object was first observed at 1950 hours and was observed continuously for twelve (12) seconds. The object appeared to be a single, unidentified flying object, delta shaped, and approximately fifteen (15) miles in diameter. The object was much smaller than the B-47 bomber, the pulse being much smaller than the object.

The object suddenly disappeared to the east at an altitude of approximately six thousand (6,000) feet. Standard time and persisted for twelve (12) seconds when it suddenly disappeared.

The object appeared from 130 degrees and proceeded in a straight and level flight. The observation was made at 0600 hours central standard time and persisted for twelve (12) seconds when it suddenly disappeared.

The object appeared to be at an estimated altitude of five thousand (5,000) feet and traveling at a speed estimated to be approximately one hundred (1,500) miles per hour. (2) The observers are considered reliable. (3) Weather in the area was clear, visibility approximately ten (10) miles, winds were calm, temperature approximately 30 degrees.

There was no traffic in the area at the time of observation.

The text found in the document is as follows:

Lake Charles AFB
I. Description of Incident
A whitish-white object with a bright-white center was observed by six Air Force personnel in a ground-visual sighting. Time of sighting was for approximately 15 seconds. The object involved estimated that the streaking object was on a level with them and 20 miles distant. The object was compared to being like a flame jet thrown in the air. There was no sound whatsoever.

II. Discussion of Incident
Weather conditions at the time of sighting (0600 CST) were CAVU and fact-limited easy spotting of meteors. This sighting was undoubtedly caused by the passage of a meteor or "fireball" through the earth's atmosphere which had unusual coloring.

III. Conclusion
Probably astronomical.
