TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

UNCLASSIFIED
27 January 53

At 1320 hrs., 26 January 53, I observed a luminous object about one hundred eighty feet long and twelve feet wide traveling through the sky from east to west at what appeared to be between seven and ten thousand feet. Both the front and rear of the object seemed to have a hazy appearance, but the lengthy body was clearly outlined. It also gave off the sound of a high-pitched hum, similar to that of an electric motor. After a minute, the object seemed to gain altitude very rapidly and it slowly faded away. I could still hear the sound for a few seconds after it was completely gone, then the sound stopped abruptly. One witness, a man from my barracks, heard the sound after the light was gone. This all took place in front of Barracks G31.

Sampson Air Force Base, New York
26 January 1953

I. Description of Incident:
At Sampson AFB, New York, visually observed one large luminous rectangular shaped unidentified flying object. In one minute the object traveled through an arc of 70 or 80 degrees, while emitting a humming sound.

II. Discussion of Incident: 
The object above described appeared for only one minute, consequently analysis is very difficult. However, ATIC requested information concerning local aircraft and was told that a commercial flight was in the area around the sighting time.

III. Conclusion:
Possibly aircraft.
