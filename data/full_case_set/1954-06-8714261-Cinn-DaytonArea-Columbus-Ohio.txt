60 In Airliner Watch
'Metallic Blob' In Sky

By ROBERT CRATER 
Citizen Washington Bureau 

WASHINGTON, July 23 — An unidentified object described by an Army colonel as a "metallic blob" was seen by the crew and 53 passengers of a transcontinental airliner over Columbus, O., June 25.

Alerted by radio to investigate the object, the crew circled under it at about 20,000 feet while the passengers took a look at the strange object.

I didn't see it long enough to determine whether it was moving, or how far above us it was."

Robert White of the Air Force "flying saucer" detail here said he hadn't heard of the report.
