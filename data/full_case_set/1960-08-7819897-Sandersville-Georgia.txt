UFO SIGHTING

Received a call from the Command Post Duty Officer, Major J. E. Edwards, Warner-Robbins AFB, Ga. who passed on information to us relating to an UFO sighting. This was third party information since it was passed to him by the Officer of the Day who actually interviewed the individuals reporting the sighting.

Mr. ________ observed the object and was corroborated by Mr. ________ who also observed the object. Observation was made at approximately 2315 EST 5 Aug 60 at Sandersville, Ga. which is 3 miles from Tennille. Object was estimated at 1000 feet altitude and observed for a period of 30 to 3 minutes. Appeared as very bright object while it was a point of "Geat" intensity preceding on a north to south course. Course was non-erratic and appeared erratic. Definitely not a star or an aircraft of the observation of the object was intensive, however, had no definite shape.  

The Officer of the Day, Captain Mattern questioned the observers resulting in the above information and can be reached Warner-Robbins, Ga. Attempted to get additional information from Major Edwards, ie. whether the observation was made while in a vehicle, or could not occur any more since he was not directly involved. Didn't think it was proper or result in much more information by calling Warner-Robbins and talking to Captain since he was not directly involved, nor the individuals concerned.

a. Witness descriptions of the object:
(1) Most reports are close to a point of calm.
(2) Object - light-breezing.
(3) Duration - for as much as 30 minutes.

The size of the object for the given distance is hard to estimate due to the poor visibility conditions that prevailed at the time. 

b. Documentary evidence:
(1) There are no photos or physical evidence.
(2) There are no radar sightings.

c. Conclusions or deductions:
(7) This was, small, or unusual one.
(8) Could be natural.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which was a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page is as follows:

(4) Velocity: 10 miles.
(1) Sighted in clouds over highway (occasional blinking in clouds southwest).
(2) Disappeared into temperature 75Â°.
2. No unusual activity or conditions which might account for the sighting.
3. No intersection or identification taken locally.
4. No local information available as to air traffic or balloon releases which could possibly have accounted for the sighting in this area.
1. Use to distance from the area in question (approximately 3 1/2 miles) indicated that this object, unlike meteors, did not have the speed and acceleration characteristics of meteors or other objects commonly classed as meteors (did not develop to larger size or break up into smaller units).
2. Apparently this was considered a bona fide sighting and thus no interpretation or explanation offered in the report. The report is simply a factual account of the events as reported by the observer.
