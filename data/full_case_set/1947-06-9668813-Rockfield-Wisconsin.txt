The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document page with text and some redacted sections. Here is the text as requested:

Incident #44 - near Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- 23 June 1947

Information given here is insufficient to indicate what was seen. If this were a totally independent observation and not one that was presumably initiated by current radio reports of Flying saucers, more weight could be given to it. As it is, with flying saucer talk rampant, almost anything from meteors to balloons or aircraft would be reported as saucers by an uncritical observer. It is unlikely, however, that there was anything astronomical about this incident.

The document image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a text-based checklist or report form related to the sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO). Due to the quality of the image, some text may not be entirely legible. Below is as much of the text as can be deciphered:

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scan of a page from a document, which is mostly illegible due to the quality of the scan. However, I will provide you with the text that is discernible:

"Pilots saw the flying saucers (about seven to ten of them) which they 
first, close enough 
 ********* said that they looked like "pie plates" and claims 
the **** saucers all then headed south.

 ***** did not report this into ATIC. It was reported by *******. 
However, the information is ********* June 24 1950.

Reported by ********* Stokes, Page 170"

Due to the poor quality of the scan and obscured text marked by asterisks, a complete and accurate transcription is not possible for the entire document.
