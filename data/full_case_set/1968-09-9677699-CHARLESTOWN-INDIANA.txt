2. LOCATION: CHARLESTOWN, INDIANA
10. CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION
3. SOURCE: CGD 01252
4. CIVILIAN: UNNAMED OBJECTS
5. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: TWO
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: TEN MINUTES
7. COURSE: ENE TO WNW
8. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NO
9. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: See case file.
COMMENTS: The observer wrote that "We have seen lights like stars, but not like stars before. They are brighter than stars, appear to move and random in different directions, but stay fairly close to one another, family uncles have been seeing lights around their farms. Since all the sightings seem of point lights, sources they is little chance of identifying the stimulis... Some may be caused by hot air balloons, asteroids, satellites, and stars and planets. Also since the sightings occurred at night, light sources they do not meet the defined definition of a UFO."

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTION: 
We looked up and saw an object following the train, which was going very fast. It appeared to be silver and circular in shape. As the train moved, the object kept pace with it, then suddenly shot forward and disappeared out of sight. We watched it for approximately 4-5 minutes. It was a bright, clear night. (September 6th)

Gentlemen:

When you read what is in this letter, please keep in mind that I am highly a scientific type of individual who is normally not inclined to note or place too much emphasis on what is seen in the skies of our nation, and I am interested in finding out what is going on. 

For the past two summers members of my family and my uncle's family have been seeing something which to use seems, compared to the last summer my aunt and her two small children saw a light over the trees shining, a very bright light that got alternately brighter and then dimmer and remained stationary. My aunt did not go to the barn since it was night and she and the children were alone(my uncle had gone to work).

Last summer I was at the other farm feeding the dogs. I finished, got in the car, and proceeded to make a run. In the middle of the turn I saw a peculiar light in the sky towards the direction of the ammunition plant. It was like a star, just hanging there, and suddenly it seemed to go out, just disappear. I stopped the car, just to see if this wouldn't reappear, but nothing happened. This light didn't temporarily disappear from view or twinkle like a star - it just disappeared altogether. Remember that the light would have been just about over the Indiana Army Ammunition Plant. 

Nothing more unusual than that was seen by me last summer, but something strange things happened a couple of weeks ago. My mother and I were sitting outside in the country, a clear night, I saw a star, or so I thought, in the extreme southwestern sky. The light was moving, but not as fast as a satellite. It would veer off in one direction, then come back, then veer off again, making strange maneuvers. I could my mother the first light we saw. About ten minutes later, another light appeared, about the same brightness, and performed the same type of maneuvers. We could not hear any sound. This went on for a while. Then the lights, I think there were two by this time, seemed to come together and just appeared to go out. They didn't twinkle out, they just seemed to disappear. I told my mother the first light we saw could not have been a plane because planes have the continual blinking lights. I thought this was strange and wondered what it could be. I could not explain it, nor could my mother.

Transcribed text:

sight of the "airplane," and we listened for the sound of its motor, which we would have heard if there was one. We knew then that neither of the lights had been a helicopter, but were convinced that the first light might have been a reflector of the light, something that could not have been seen during the day and not had the safety risk that it had without "BLIP-BLIP-BLIP" of its usual signal lights.

My brother and I have seen from our bedroom window a "STAR" which would come to a high-speed "ZOOM" or "STAIR-CASE" pattern, go back to the higher sky region, and continue the sideways, zig-zag pattern of movement for an extended period of time.

Last Friday night, the 6th, my 13-year-old sister came running from her bedroom about 11:30 p.m. to tell me that she had watched a light come out of the back door (she and I, the others had already gone to bed), and we saw one of the "stars" that, unless you have seen them before, you would not know are any more than ordinary stars. They started to move, and we watched in awe as they picked out the "busiest" stars for observation. The light was bright enough though it could hardly be seen in the same region of the sky that our porch light is in. The light maneuvered back and forth until it vanished out.

Saturday night, my sister again saw one of those lights in the sky. This time it did not move, but we had seen them before and recognized its characteristic behavior. We did not keep a very close watch on the object, and after about an hour and a half, it was gone. The light that she had found the night before did not check out (very often?) when I looked again after the hour and a half.

I am beginning to be concerned about this matter, since there are a number of things that may be very interesting to someone: the Indiana Army Ammunition Plant at Charlestown (the Holston Munitions Company of Indiana electric generating plant and looks at Louisville (the Jefferson proving ground) the McAlpine Dam and locks at Louisville, and the electric lines generating plant at Madison, and the electric lines pass in the distance several miles). 

I am of the opinion that a discreet investigation is in order. I and some of the members of our two families would like to know something about what this can and does mean, and what the government is prepared to do about it.

Signed,

THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA YOU HAVE OBSERVED. YOUR NAME WILL NOT BE USED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY STATEMENTS YOU MAKE. HOWEVER, YOUR SIGNATURE AT BOTTOM IS REQUIRED AS NEEDED FOR FORWARDING OF THIS DOCUMENT.

WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST SEE THE PHENOMENON? 9:50 MONTH SEPT YEAR 1968

WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SEE THE PHENOMENON? 10:25 MINUTES 35

WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED.
[Compass rose sketch with "X" at NW and "!" at NE]

WHAT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE PHENOMENON?
We saw it like a star, but not like a star. They are brighter than stars. Its more like a star, near the moon, but there are changes from time to time like star in different directions or power installations. They move up, down, side to side faster than stars. I'm like a shooting star.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR?
Was seen on horizon that it went below tree line or was to far to see anymore. They are hard to watch since they move from place to place.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of a landscape with a bright object in the sky. The sketch is labeled "appeared" and "very bright". Below the sketch, there is a brief description that states "all of the object would have been covered by this match head", indicating that the object observed was larger than the size of a match head.
