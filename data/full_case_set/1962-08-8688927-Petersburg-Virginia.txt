The image contains three sketches or drawings, but no actual photograph. The sketches depict the following:

1. A sketch showing the path of a high-speed object in the sky, with the object's position marked as "A" and "B".

2. A larger sketch showing a landscape with buildings and roads, with an object in the sky. This is referred to as "A" at the position where the object was first seen.

3. A smaller sketch showing a landscape with a sun or light source in the sky.

As an OCR system, I will now output the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same sketch to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a U.S. Air Force technical information sheet, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was the official program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the United States from 1952 to 1969.

The text on the document reads:

U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and acted as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may restate information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important.

I performed optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the image, and the output is:

I reported my sightings to get a better description of the viewing time. Four to five minutes seems about right for the U.F.O. to have moved down the sky.

Detachment 11th District D.C.
Dear Sirs:
On the night of 8/1/62 at about 8:30 PM I observed in the sky from my single story porch what appeared to be a formation of 3-4 objects flying at a very high rate of speed. The objects were glowing with a pulsating light and appeared much larger in size than aircraft or satellites I've observed in the sky. The objects were traveling in an apparent east to west direction and seemed to gradually gain altitude or disappear from sight. This happened very rapidly over a period of about 15-20 seconds. Although I did not have the opportunity to take a photograph, the visual observation was quite striking and the objects seemed to defy conventional explanation. I am reporting this sighting to your office in accordance with Air Force regulations. Please let me know if you require any additional information.
