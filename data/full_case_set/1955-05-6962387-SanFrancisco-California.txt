The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an UFCB (Unidentified Flying Object Bulletin) index card. The card provides details about an observation made on May 14, 1955 in San Francisco, California. It describes a reddish bronze object that was observed for approximately 5 minutes. The conclusion suggests that the object was possibly astronomical, potentially relating to the planet Jupiter.

UFCB INDEX CARD
1. DATE: 14 May 1955
2. LOCATION: San Francisco, California
3. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Local
4. DATE/TIME GROUP: 1810/0052Z
5. PHOTOS: Yes
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Approx five (5) minutes
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One (1)
9. COURSE: Just south of the W
11. COMMENTS: Possibly astronomical. Planet Jupiter. Due to the likelihood of this sighting being a recognized astronomical phenomenon, since the sighting and the direction in which the object was observed correspond to that of a known astronomical object, namely the planet Jupiter, the probability of further investigation uncovering additional information to confirm this conclusion was authorized by this organization (USAF-ATIC).
