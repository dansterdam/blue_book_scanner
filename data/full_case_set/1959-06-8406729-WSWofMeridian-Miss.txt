The above persons and agencies supported in this investigation.
No positive conclusion can be made by the reporting officers as to what the observers may have seen. In the opinion of the officers investigating this incident, there is a possibility that the light sighted could possibly be related to the described course of the light seen by the observers. The aircraft had a red rotating beacon underneath and should be considered in the observer's account.

PAGE 2 of 3 PAGES

1. The following report is the result of an investigation conducted by Batchelor Air Force Base, 1st Lt. John P. Toth on 7-15-59.

a. In answer to questions contained in the message: (U)
(1) Just a light was seen. (U)
(2) The size is purely an estimate and is not too reliable. (U) 
(3) It was difficult to estimate the true distance of the object but from the observers description, it was thought to be about thirteen (13) miles from the observer by measurement of a map in accordance with their description. (U) 
(4) Observer describes the turns as axis turns and the second turn. (U)

b. Upon investigation of the sighting mentioned in the newspaper, it was found that this incident probably occurred on 26 June 52. It was published in the Lincoln paper and broadcast on local stations by coincidence only. The heading of the Air Intelligence Report indicates the incident occurred at Batchelor base. The story from Nelson, Nebraska was evidently picked up by a reporter and deemed of interest to the Batchelor Base provost Marshal. The story from Nelson, Nebraska was evidently picked up by a reporter and deemed of interest to the reporting officer as unreliable in his estimate of what he saw. (U)

c. Further investigation of the incident revealed the following information: Interrogation (sic) in accordance with format prescript by paragraph. (U)

(1) Appeared like a "Sputniick". (U)
(2) About the size of a prominent star or a "Sputnick" crossing the sky. (U) 
(3) Bright white light, if standing still, would have looked like a star. (U)
(4) One. (U)
(5) N/A
(6) None. (U)
(7) None. (U)
(8) None. (U) 
(9) Moved at the same speed as an artificial satellite, a steady speed. (U)
