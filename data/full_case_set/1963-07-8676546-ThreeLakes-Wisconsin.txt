Dear sir:

As I don't usually write letters, I couldn't quite decide where to send this. It is a report sighting a "flying saucer", or something that looked a heck of a lot like a flying saucer. I suppose you can forward this to the Air Force, or the agency in charge of this, whatever agency it is in charge of this.

To get down to dress tacks:
All the moment I am staying at my Aunts near Bridgeport Cottage, which is near Three Lakes. Impression: the area is mostly wooded, with it is not as crowded as some areas.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows handwritten text on a page, which appears to be an excerpt from a document.

Extracted text:

Slightly suspended as might seem.
During the summer there are
people staying in their summer 
cottages nearby. Last night (Wednesday
July 17) it was about 1 o'clock in
the morning. I was awake, looking
out the window. An object
(which I have designated flying
saucer) flew across the upper part
of the window, then I lost sight
of it. It flew too high to be easily
to see too be the moon, and it
did not in any way resemble
any planes or helicopters that I
know. It seemed to be some a
unusual type of aircraft.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather handwritten text that appears to be part of a report or document. The text describes a person's experience of observing a strange moving object, noting that it seemed to be glittering and that the person could not estimate its rate of speed. The text also mentions that the object was "really fast" and that the person was unable to determine what it was.

Text transcribed from the image:

mile did stare, and I don't know
how high (as I have had no ex-
perience in measuring this kind of
distance). It seemed to be glittering.
The object was moving slightly
swifter than a plane, altho I think
a plane could have caught up &
it if it were a really fast one.
It glowed. That is, it glowed.
I can't estimate the rate per minute.
(Somewhere around 80 times, I think)
I don't know whether it made any
noise or not, because it was
avingly last night and 8:30 not
yet used to the normal background
