The image does not contain any photographs, but rather illustrations or sketches related to observing unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The first sketch shows a curved line indicating the path of an object you first saw in the sky, and the second set of sketches shows the relative positions of the object when you first and last saw it.

Text output from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point where "A" on the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) where you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
