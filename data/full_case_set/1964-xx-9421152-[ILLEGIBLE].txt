The text contained in the document is as follows:

"Last night just after midnight
the wife (name not clear) phoned the office to say that something was going on outside their home in the country. I got the call about 1:15 or 1:20 AM. I phoned my department to have a car check it out. The police officer called back shortly and said there was nothing unusual going on and that the wife had decided to sit up the rest of the night. I asked him if he had talked to the wife and he said "No, I just made a drive around the place." Meanwhile I had dressed and gotten into my car to go out and take a look, but the officer called back before I left, so I decided to wait until morning to check it out myself.

When I got there about 8:00 AM the wife said she had seen several lights in the sky which had been moving in an erratic manner, some zig-zagging and some making sharp turns. She said one object hovered over the house for some time and then suddenly shot straight up and out of sight. She said it gave off a brilliant white light that seemed to illuminate the whole countryside. This lasted about 15-20 minutes, and she became quite upset and called the office. She said she did not see or hear any conventional aircraft in the area.

I made a complete search of the entire section and could find no signs of any landing or impact on the ground. There were no physical traces and the wife was the only witness. The weather was clear and visibility was excellent. This seems to be another of those sightings that defies any reasonable explanation based on our current knowledge. I will forward this report to Project Blue Book for further evaluation and possible investigation if they feel it is warranted."

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The document appears to be a report or letter, discussing a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The text is written in cursive handwriting and discusses the details of the sighting, including the object's appearance and behavior.

Transcribing the text:

"The object was spherical and attached to the bottom of a seemingly long and thin cylinder. The aspect of the object was about 1:4 and its apparent size was slightly larger than a dime as viewed from 40 feet away.

It passed over very slowly and silently, maintaining a constant altitude of 50 to 100 feet. As it passed, I saw no source of propulsion, no flames, fire or smoke. 

As I went to tell the family, there was a brief flash in the area of the object, and the object was gone, just as suddenly as it had appeared. There was no noise or vibration of any kind.

I remember that the object seemed about 20 to 25 feet in diameter and the cylinder was rather longer, perhaps 50 to 60 feet in length. The speed was very slow, only about 20 to 25 miles per hour, and the direction of travel was from southwest to northeast.

I hope this information may be of some use to you. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions."
