The image contains a compass diagram and two sketches. The compass diagram is labeled with degrees and provides instructions for how to indicate the height and direction of an observed object. The first sketch shows a curved path with instructions to draw a picture to show the motion of an object or objects. The second sketch shows a curved path, suggesting the motion of more than one object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
