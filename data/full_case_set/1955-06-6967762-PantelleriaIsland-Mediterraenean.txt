Estimated to be 50 or 60 degrees weather conditions clear and calm. Apparently the object was traveling at a high rate of speed from the east to west. I spotted the object from my home in Pantelleria, looking out over the Mediterranean Sea. The object was traveling at a high altitude of approximately 50 or 60 degrees from the horizon. Weatherwise conditions at the time were calm and clear. 

As I watched, the object appeared to me to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed from east to west across the horizon. I would estimate its speed to be at least 1000 mph or more. It seemed to be surrounded by a white glow or luminous field. I watched the object for about 2-3 minutes as it passed across the horizon. It did not seem to deviate from its course at all but maintained a constant speed and direction.

What I saw appeared to be a metallic or reflecting surface, disc-shaped object. It was traveling at a high altitude, perhaps 20-30,000 feet, and was heading in a westerly direction. I am quite familiar with all types of conventional aircraft, and this was unlike anything I have ever seen before. Its tremendous speed and manner of flight rules out the possibility of it being a conventional aircraft.

I have heard nothing more about this sighting, and no further investigation seems to have been made. I merely wished to record my observations, as I found the experience to be most unusual and intriguing. If you have any questions, I shall be glad to answer them to the best of my ability.

Text transcribed from the image:

The object and its behavior in a factory office. We drove home at noon and the driver reported many strange people and unnatural occurrences to his crew associates.  He answered 500 questions within seconds. The noise of the cars passing through the area was completely drowned out by an unnatural humming sound that followed the object. It was a close passage by the object would dive out of a maneuver to a 100ft altitude and dart back upward at a great speed as if to avoid detection. I noticed that the elect-ric lights were slightly dimmer as the object approached and were restored to normal about 5 minutes before the scene.  The object seemed stationary until light shone above.  I can say it was 53 units that disappeared from record.  No change in its position was definite clear and found nothing unusual in the area and they cleared out a plan that on explanation of the situation that morning outfit, a head to better.

The text in the document states:

"It is U.S. agency and they had received a report of something unusual. 2 Believe it was of brighter and slightly luminous like flame and went like 30 to 50 times, but the time it took to clear in about 20 to 30 seconds. Got a clear observation of what seem an unidentified flying object, moved in a steady straight line. I don't believe in dangers on possible UFO reports, we saw nothing from other side that would indicate that. I was experianced it. UFO reports.

Eias Bank/SAVTOCS/73a8/29 Jun 55

Dear Mr.

This is in reply to your letter concerning unidentified flying objects.

The investigation of unidentified flying objects reported to the Air Force has indicated that the bulk of such reports are easily explainable as known types of aerial vehicles or phenomena. This type of project is like the old "foo fighters" of World War II about which we have no detailed information.

In 13 years of investigation over 5,000 reports of unidentified flying objects have been received. Extensive investigation of these reports had disclosed little or no evidence of a technology superior to our own civilian and military aircraft. No physical evidence, either in the form of crashed or grounded vehicles or parts thereof, has been obtained. Reliable witnesses have been interviewed but the results have usually been fragmentary and inconclusive.

We are unable to evaluate your report due to the great time lapse.

Sincerely,
GEORGE J. MADARAS

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
SOURCE: GRUPO Newsletter, 3 Feb 56

STREAMLINE WINDS RANGE, WETOH, TOUCHDOWN
Case 156, Adelaide, Australia, June 18, 1955 - Reported by the editor, but let's face it, something's wrong. It was a special report, deemed too private, by the AUIS Research Section. I'm afraid we're not at liberty to reveal more about their identity and character of the football. The report reads: a follow-up showed little doubt that the anomalous weather - defined as streamline winds of a 1,000 yards radius at 200-300 ft altitude - actually occurred. This was observed at 5:28 p.m. on June 18 in the southern suburbs of Fletcher's Park at 5:28 p.m. on June 18, when the winds were estimated at 15-20 knots and lasted from 2-3 minutes.
Several witnesses described this "phenomenon", which involved a large dark object traversing rapidly and silently in the streamline pattern, and their unanimous testimony seems quite certain. Authorities have ruled out normal causes. Investigation over the weekend disclosed that a large "shape" resembling a ball or ovoid hovered at about 200 ft altitude just prior to the "touchdown" of the winds. Radar stations were alerted (but the object was not detected). The winds then subsided as quickly as they had appeared.
There is little doubt that some anomalistic aerial event took place over the Adelaide area on June 18. The report also stated that the object moved across the sky in a streamline pattern, suggesting a possible connection with the winds. A small amount of debris present, however, it was possibly not significant enough to warrant extensive inquiry. The investigators conceded that the exact nature of the event remains speculative. They stated that more data would be required to determine exactly what occurred on that day over Adelaide.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report discussing an incident involving a fireball or meteorite striking a workshop in Adelaide, Australia on June 15, 1955. The text provides details about the incident, including the time, location, and observations made by witnesses about the apparent entry of the meteorite into a building and the subsequent explosion. The text also mentions similar incidents reported in Selma, Alabama and near Logan, Utah. No humans are visually identifiable in the provided image.

FIREBALL FINDS RANGE, WRECKS WORKSHOP
Cape 128, Adelaide, Australia, June 15, 1955 - Par don the idiom, but let's face it, something's screws got loose. A special report prepared by the Australian AERIAL PHENOMENA INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE about the ubiquity and character of the fireball. The report follows:
The explosive blasts occurred in the suburb of Flinders Park at 2:20 a.m. on June 15 and caused by a bright fireball measuring 15' x 20'. One roof was utterly destroyed. Authorities have ruled out normal causes like lightning, gas explosion, etc. It is thought the blasting could have been tributable to a meteorite striking the building. However much research was removed in several tons of debris following the fire that followed the explosion. But no trace of anything meteoric was found on examination of the site. It seems clear, however, from the facts that the meteorite shattered into small fragments upon impact and dispersing towards the surrounding houses, one of which was given as a witness before the explosion she had seen a bright fireball flash across the sky in that direction. The direction of the earth is seen to have been to the south and the meteorite shattered on impact. 
While we are aware of the fact that the fireball is the result of the "shower" of a larger body, we have no evidence that the explosion was caused by a resulting meteoric stream, as some scientists have suggested. The fireball's actions were witnessed by several local inhabitants who described it as a "quiet but very rapid streak" illuminating the sky. See CRIFO newsletter, Feb. 4, 1955.

EXTRACTED FROM KZIC 23472J, JR-1693-55 FR GERMANY

"A radio message of the Dutch tanker "Ganair" was received at Amsterdam on 30 June 55 according to which the Captain, the first officer and the radio operator observed during normal hours, a cigar-shaped body in about 7,000 meters altitude over the Mediterranean Sea. This body emitted a strong light, at first fell from the sky, then stood slightly wavering at the mentioned altitude for about 16 minutes, and finally became smaller and smaller until it disappeared entirely. This phenomenon was observed by other tankers, and appeared in the vicinity of Pantelleria Island."

"Lights. It had no halo of any kind. It stream down at the ground. It was elliptical in shape. It seemed to melt in as it reached the ground. There was a glowing effect up through the center, the three was no vibration, just a steady, bright, straight line. It remained visible and then disappeared gradually. I had a note pad with me which I grabbed alder, but it slipped from my hands because they were shaking. The object was only visible for about 10 seconds total. I passed a Santa Fe telegraph operator nearby who was on the telephone with the Commanding Officer. This story is plain old. About 3 weeks later another incident occurred home 12 miles from the hotel mentioned had occurred. It related odd light thing to her. One was a saucer shape and oval in outline--oo shape. The other was like a short line like the first. Happened  to be at 9:15 pm both times."

Brook was reading the report from around 4 p.m. on the 14th August. The report talks about a flying object that was seen around the island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean Sea. The object was described as round, and it was seen for several minutes. The report mentions that the object was tracked on radar. The document also refers to the American military and their involvement in investigating the incident.

The main account was a strange experience.  It happened about 8:15 a.m. on June 20, 1952 on a small farm.  There was a saucer I stopped through.  I had insects on my sweater and as I shook them off, I saw this object hovering at a low altitude making nearly a straight climb, appeared very much silver, no wings or anything visible. It was over in a few seconds. This occurred at Pantelleria Island in the Mediterranean. I saw it with my own eyes and could not understand or explain what I saw. It was about 20 feet in diameter. Visually this was a strange sight.
