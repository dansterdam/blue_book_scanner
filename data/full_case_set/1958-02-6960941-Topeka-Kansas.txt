Dear Captain:

I now have had a chance to look through all the reports sent to me in connection with the sightings from Denver interests me very much and I am giving it the full consideration. It is clear that something could not been any of the known satellites since the time and location could be very accurately fixed. The problem is to determine what the object could have been and whether a satellite approaching or re-entering would fit the pattern. As far as I know, there were no known Russian Sputniks up at the time and anything identifiable by our moonwatch teams. This is puzzling, so much so that I had hoped the time and other details would enable us to identify the object. It would be a great help if any correlation with radar or other observations could be found.

I had an experience the other night which may bear on this. I had been instructing by means of the sky-watch telescope and we had gone out on the lawn to check our observations when suddenly we saw a bright object traveling at high speed and making a curious sound. A few minutes later another such object came through in the same direction but at a different elevation. A third one I was able to detect over several minutes, but the motions were so erratic I am not sure they were the same object gone through I might honestly be excited or worried and that is to determine what is going on. I seem to have seen something carrying such lights.

It is also conceivable two such experienced officers could have made the mistake I had first made, but strange things happened in the observation, including an alteration in the object's course and speed on the third pass that I could not explain. All other "unknown sputniks" that our teams from the time have reported seemed to be performing in a normal and predicable fashion.

As to the other cases, which I am returning (I will not Denver case very soon), I generally seen to have a rather difficult time assessing meteor observations--five of them. Two other reports remain that I will have to study further.

(period of reporting twilight had already begun). Vera was a "very say, near the going or sighting but it was only temporary. The object was a circular object in the sky. This was like the type that came later, and I know from past experience how easily it can be mistaken for an airplane. It made no noise whatsoever and there was no blotting out of the stars. The pre-sunrise sky, and I know from past experience how easily it can be mistaken for an airplane. It made no noise whatsoever and there was no blotting out of the stars, and it was Veras.

The case of the "daylight meteor" is greatly ambigious. While the daylight meteor could be confused by some, I would still favor the accidental release of stress and tension from some previous nervous strain. It could have been some type of light meteor; if the light was simply a bright reflection of sunshine in other cases, there is nothing hostile, and I say this with confidence. For a bright object, a satellite or other falling object, to carry such a visible record of a disturbance, although I think it quite unlikely, is possible. It could conceiveably have been a burst weather or cosmic ray balloon, with the reflection from traveling material perhaps being responsible for the damage, I think this is a distinct possibility. The occurrence is so uncertain and unexplained that the multiple reports of the same object suggest a real observation was made, although distorted by different observers from different angles. The first visual observation was at 4:00 a.m. their time which makes the sighting believable. The chances of such balloon launch retrievals day or night are reasonably good, and they seem to be the most likely explanation.

I am looking forward to visiting you in your new quarters---- I hope in early June.

Cheers, -
