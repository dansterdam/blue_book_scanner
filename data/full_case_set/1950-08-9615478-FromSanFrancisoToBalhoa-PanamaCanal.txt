(S) CONFIDENTIAL 
Flaming aerial body 
ROCKET WEAPONS (probably a secret weapon) - Other details obscure 
The German motor vessel "ULM" was the focus of this event. Northbound on the Panama Canal, 19 AUG 1950. A peculiar light maneuver which occurred during the evening. 
Witness statements indicate US AIR FORCE personnel were contacted. Master of the ship reported "WHAT?" 
Sky Appearance, 7 AUG 1950 at 2:RICH in the vicinity of the Panama Canal. UNCLEAR as traveling from San Francisco to Balboa, Panama Canal. 
At this moment, there appeared to be a bridge of raster, indistinct. 
The sailor was the first to notice this phenomenon. It is suggested that a flaming aerial object could be a ship arising from the horizon. However, details do not permit a conclusive determination. The object was first observed to the southeast, and then disappeared to the north.

The engineer on duty, who was able to see a flaming body half the size of the setting sun and with a bright glow of a glass ship, it did not look like a meteor or any other cluster of stars. 

The appearance had been noticed by numerous witnesses and the engineer's statement corroborated their impressions.

All agreed and describe that they saw a glowing frontal dark and all the illumination appeared to be a time relatively brief (over seconds and at the maximum of seconds). From the upper rear side it seems that there were rays or sparks. All declared that they have never seen such a sight before.

REPORTING OFFICER'S COMMENT: During the preliminary investigation of this incident, it was considered that the sighting could be a meteorological phenomenon. However, the statements of the intelligent individual, seems to indicate that the incident has sufficient ground for possible credence.

The IFF No. 0406.0400 was issued to the one having the greatest similarity in public conception. Thereafter, the case was classified as an unidentified flying object for further investigation regarding the fact occurrences and appearances.

Meteors in the Records

The American Meteorites Society, whose members specialise in the study of meteors and meteorites, for years have collected reports of such phenomena. From a large enough number of good descriptions of a given meteor, astronomers can analyze the data mathematically and determine the meteor's radiant—the point in the heavens from which it seems to come. The meteor is then identified by its radiant and given an AMS number. The data were published in Meteorites, the journal of the society, and thus made available for future research.

During the years 1950 to 1955 the records show some fine examples of fireballs, many of them green, that were somehow overlooked by saucer enthusiasts. On August 11, 1950, during the maximum of the Perseid shower, a blue-green fireball (AMS 2336) apparently oval or cigar-shaped, appeared over Washington, Oregon, and Idaho at 7:30 P.M. and was reported by more than 100 witnesses. So brilliant that it showed a noticeable glow in a horizontal path, silently broke into three pieces, and disappeared.

September 23, 1953, was a big day for meteors. At 1:35 A.M., a giant fireball (AMS 2358) roared over southeastern Illinois from north to south, leaving a luminous train visible in five states and illuminating the sky and countryside from St. Louis to Louisville. The final detonation, over western Kentucky, was heard over an area 1000 miles square and shook buildings from Paducah to Memphis. Fragments showed penetrated farms over a twenty-five mile area, struck five buildings, and showered pounds of meteorites dropped in Murray, Calloway County, Kentucky, and are now in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. That same night about 10:45 P.M. fireballs were reported by plane crews flying over a six-state area—Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico [p. 115]. Similar fireballs that vanished without trace were reported on September 28, 1953 (AMS 2351); October 4, 1953 (AMS 2339); May 15, 1954; and October 27, 1954 (AMS 2337).

UNCLASSIFIED

Several Japanese and one CIC agent reported sighting unidentified objects which appeared to be a flying saucer as approximately 2,000 ft altitude on 11 August 1959. Reported to Aircraft Control and Warning Site No. 6 and from there to PFAF A-2. The Japanese weather station in the area received about thirty (30) calls from the people inquiring about the objects. The CIC Agent is getting as much information as possible from eye witnesses. CIC agent located in NIIGATA, Medium altitude, color was yellow, changed to blue and then to red, separated in two parts and faded out and not seen to drop. A hissing noise was heard similar to air released from a balloon. Estimated speed was 1 mile in 5 seconds.
