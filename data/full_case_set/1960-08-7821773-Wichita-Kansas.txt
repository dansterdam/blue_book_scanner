UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: UFO

DATE OF REPORT: 29 August 1960
PLACE: McConnell AFB, Kansas
PREPARED BY (NAME): Capt. P. A. TILLMAN, USAF
FIRST (INITIAL) COMMANDER, 3247 COMMUNICATIONS SQUADRON
SUMMARY:
On 23 August 1960 at 0545 hours, the observer, Max DOOL 5308, was on the airfield at McConnell AFB, Kansas, when he observed a UFO. The object consisted of a spherical shape about the size of a golf ball when held at arm's length. It was a silvery color and had three lights, although yellow in nature, gave the sphere an overall effect of a dull bronze color.
The UFO was observed for about 0005 north or northeast of the station and no sound or vibration was noted. The object remained stationary for a few seconds, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. The UFO was observed to have the shape of a sphere about the size of a golf ball when held at arm's length. Three lights, although yellow in nature, gave the sphere an overall effect of a dull bronze color.
SHAPE AND FEATURES AS VIEWED

It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the UFO was a weather balloon or another satellite reentry.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text written in handwriting. It appears to be a page from an old report or document.

I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

Ich saw the object appear in the W-NW at an elevation of about 45-50 degrees. It was stationary at first, then began to descend rapidly in a straight line to about 25-30 degrees elevation, where it appeared to lose altitude for a few seconds, then moved rapidly S and gained altitude, disappearing from sight to the S at an elevation of approximately 50-55 degrees. The object appeared to be round in shape and had a reddish-orange glow, which did not change in intensity. There were no visible appendages or exhaust. The object was estimated to be at a distance of 5-10 miles. The sighting lasted approximately 1 minute. There was a slight breeze from the W-NW at the time, and the sky was clear with some scattered high clouds.
