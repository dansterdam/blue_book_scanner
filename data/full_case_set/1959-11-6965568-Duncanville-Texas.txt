The image does not contain any photographs, but rather two sketches. 

The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" and "B" marked on it, illustrating how high an object was above the horizon (skyline) when first seen and then later observed.

The second sketch contains two smaller drawings. The larger one depicts a person standing on a road with mountains in the background, while the smaller one shows a landscape with a curved horizon line.

Text output from OCR:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

It was a bright clear night. There were numerous star clusters in the sky and the moon was full. The object we observed appeared to be - Circular in shape with a bright glowing body and a dark rim around the edge. As it passed across the sky at a tremendous rate of speed, it suddenly seemed to stop and reverse its direction. It was then noiseless and gave off no trail or exhaust. After hovering for a few minutes, it suddenly took off at an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object was estimated to be approximately 50 ft. in diameter. We were very impressed with the manner in which this object was able to change its flight path and the high rate of speed at which it traveled.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing an observation of a flying saucer on November 17, 1959 in Duncanville, Texas. The text is as follows:

U. S. Air Force Base 
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

I saw a flying saucer on the day of November 17, 1959 at 3:45 P.M. The saucer came from the south and went in a hurry toward the East. It was about the size of a small saucer car. The saucer was round like a ball and was of a metallic [?] color. It gave off a [?] and a little noise as it went in a curved upward pattern. The color of it was a very bright metallic, it made me think if I had not seen it I would not [?] anything about it.  The saucer fell out of sight behind a cloud in sight and visibility was very good. The ground wind was moving a southwesterly direction. 

Name: [redacted]
Age: 12
Mailing address: Duncanville, Texas

When I first saw it it wasn't moving.

Your truly,
[redacted]

P.S. I don't think it was a weather balloon because it went fast for a balloon.
