KIRTLAND AFB, N.M.
1959-04-08
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
1. On the evening of 4 April 1959, a B-47 aircraft from the 4950th Test Group, Kirtland AFB, N.M., while on a routine training mission, encountered an unidentified aerial object. The object was first sighted about 30 miles northeast of Clovis, N.M., at an altitude estimated to be between 20,000 and 30,000 feet. Initially, the object was observed as a bright light, but as the aircraft approached closer, the object appeared to increase in size and take on a more solid appearance. The pilot of the B-47 stated that the object was definitely not a meteor or a weather balloon.
2. According to the pilot, the object appeared to be between 40 and 50 feet in diameter, and seemed to be oscillating or wobbling as it moved. The pilot stated that the object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before it suddenly accelerated at a terrific rate of speed and disappeared from view. 
3. Due to the nature of this incident, it is requested that this information be forwarded to appropriate agencies for their evaluation and possible further investigation.
