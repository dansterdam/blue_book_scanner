Observer was a road when she noticed a group of lights that were "white, yellow, orange, and blue in color". The lights moved and changed direction rapidly. The lights would abruptly vanish when the observer would look away.
The description of the object could fall in the category of "unusual aerial phenomena" such as ball lightning. The object could not have been attributed to any known astronomical or meteorological phenomenon in a lack of data to substantiate them.

The call was routed to the 29th Air Division (SAGE) Intelligence Officer, who dispatched a mobile unit to investigate.  The Intelligence Officer telephoned the light on previous occasions, but after checking the area, could not remember the time or the details of the sighting.

3. On the afternoon of Wednesday, 9 November, personnel from the Intelligence Office visited the area and interviewed the observers. The Intelligence personnel was not present, and has not been questioned by the mobile unit.  There was a few inches of snow on the ground and the road, and there had been only the light falling of snow prior to the visit.  There was an eight inch snowfall of 15 October, and this was all gone in a few days when one weather patrol could no longer find any evidence of it.  The last snowfall was a car was on when the UFO was seen.  No other cars were in the area at the time of the sighting, and no light sources of any kind - the highway 33 is not visible from the house, and no light sources of any kind - highway 33 is not visible from the house, and no light source of any kind was observed.  The UFO sighting lasted for an undetermined length of time.  They are fairly dense - The trees average 25-30 feet in height, and do not obscure visibility to any great extent.  The object was brighter than any star, and both larger and brighter than the planet Venus.

The image contains a sketch or drawing of a UFO sighting, as noted in the caption "Sketch Drawing of UFO Sighting". There is no photograph present in this image.

Here is the text from the document, as interpreted by an OCR system:

None of the people interviewed had any explanation of the lights. They were evidently not caused by aircraft. 

Mrs. Stecker said her son heard nothing when he saw the objects, but lights flickered that he kept awake by a whirring sound which no one else heard. 

6. The light has only been seen in recent weeks, and some of the sightings occurred when others were home. The light leaves no trace behind. It did not melt the snow.

FOR THE COMMANDER:

WILLIAM B. STECKER, 2nd Lt, USAF
Intelligence Officer
