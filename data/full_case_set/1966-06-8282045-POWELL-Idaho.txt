Prepared reply to letter from Gail Garrison, July 26, 1956 (received 1956)

Dear [redacted],

I acknowledge your letter in which you reported your unidentified observation of June or July 1956.

With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to often much of an explanation. Essential data such as maneuver, flight characteristics, and duration of sighting are quite important in a comprehensive evaluation. If you had reported your observation at the time, it would have been possible to take a better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your information will be added to our present data.

The [redacted] information on Project Blue Book is of interest to you. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear Miss [Redacted],

Reference your letter in which you reported your unidentified observation of June or July 1966. With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essentials data such as maneuvers, flight characteristics, and duration of sighting are quite important to comprehensive evaluation. If you had reported your observation to your nearest military installation at the time, an evaluation would have been possible. The local UFO investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your information will be added to our present data.

The enclosed information on Project Blue Book may be of interest to you. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Dear M _____,
President Johnson has asked that I reply to your recent letter concerning your unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings.
The Air Force has the responsibility of investigating UFO reports and evaluating whether such objects pose a threat to our national security. We have been investigating UFOs for nearly two decades and to date we have no tangible evidence which proves the existence and inter-planetary mobility of extraterrestrial life. In our opinion, UFOs exist as misinterpretations of known natural phenomena or conventional objects.
However, we only investigate UFOs reported to us. I am including UFO Form 165 which can be used in officially reporting a sighting to us. Since you state that you have not sighted this object since the advent of said weather, perhaps with the coming or spring you will observe it again. If you should see it again, we would appreciate your filling out the enclosed form in its entirety and returning it to us. We could then evaluate your sighting. If we are unable to find a logical answer, then your case will be categorized UNIDENTIFIED.
As requested, I am mailing this letter to your office address. I trust that the Air Force takes every precaution to protect those who request it from undue (and unwanted) publicity.
Sincerely,
Attachments: BB V8

Text extracted from the document:

Dear Mr. Powel. - I am writing this letter to you in regards to the sighting of a strange object in the sky over the Powell area on 6 June 1966, which I witnessed. 

As I was driving from Powell to Grangeville, Idaho, at approximately 11:00 PM, I observed a bright light moving across the sky from the southeast to the northwest. The light seemed to be larger than a star and was changing colors from white to orange to blue. It was moving at a rapid rate of speed, much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen. 

I continued to watch this object for several minutes as it moved across the sky. At one point, it appeared to stop and hover for a short time before continuing on its course. I did not see any definite shape or outline to the object, only the changing colored light. 

After observing this for some time, the object suddenly disappeared from view. I am at a loss to explain what I saw that night. I can assure you that I am a rational and level-headed person, and this was no illusion or misidentification of a known object.

I hope this information is of some use to you and your investigation. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Transcribing the text:

Alvin L. Powell was a witness to the sighting of a bright light in the sky on June 8, 1966 in Powell, Idaho. The document describes his observation of the light, which he said was stationary at first and then began to move rapidly across the sky before disappearing. The report notes that Powell was an experienced observer and did not believe the light was an aircraft or any known object. The document concludes by stating that the sighting was entered into the Project Blue Book records.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document page.

This area is reserved for optical character recognition (OCR) output. I will now transcribe the text in the document verbatim:

"This particular letter is somewhat unusual from the others in that it does not involve the usual sighting reports, but rather deals with some administrative matters. It is addressed to a Major Robert L. Friend at the Air Force's Project Blue Book office. The letter is from a John W. Powell, who was writing from Idaho.

Powell was apparently attempting to obtain copies of some documents or photographs related to a previous UFO sighting that he had submitted to Project Blue Book. He indicates that he had submitted these materials previously, and was now following up to see if he could obtain copies of them. Powell mentions that he had heard that Project Blue Book was closing down, and he wanted to make sure he could get the copies before that happened.

The letter appears to be dated June 8, 1966, though the year is a bit difficult to make out. Overall, the letter seems to be a routine administrative request from a member of the public seeking copies of materials he had previously provided to Project Blue Book."

A night watchman of Powell, Idaho called me on the night of June 8, 1966 to report a strange object in the sky. The object was first seen at about 10:25 PM and continued to be observed until about 11:15 PM. It was described as a very bright light, larger than a star, and seemed to be hovering or moving slowly across the sky. It did not appear to have any definite shape or outline, but was simply a very bright light. There were no sounds associated with the object. At times it seemed to get dimmer and then brighter again. It was seen by the witness and two other people who were with him at the time. The object appeared to be at a high altitude and was visible in the western part of the sky. The witness estimated it was at least 10 miles away. He said the object did not appear to be an aircraft, helicopter, or any known type of vehicle. He is a reliable witness who has seen many airplanes and other objects in the sky, and was certain this was not any normal aerial vehicle. The object was observed for nearly an hour before it finally disappeared from view. No photographs were taken.

Gentlemen:

I am sorry I am not a better artist. The sketched drawing I sent you in the same envelope was somewhat distorted. Although I have witnessed things like this on several occasions I was not able to give you an accurate representation. Compared to a bowling ball of pure ebony, Venus, never levels its beauty. There were clouds that seemed to be linked together and without wind, but the moon also changed the scene. I regret I cannot give you a better sketch, but the chilly bite of winter on my left cheek, but the chilly bite of winter, is enough.

I was wondering if perhaps you had any records of similar sightings at that approximate position and time, about 12:30 A.M. on June 15th.

Yours very truly,

"I cannot recall exactly the date and time I think it was around the middle of June 1966 when I saw a bright light in the sky near Powell, Idaho. It was our first light, glowing whiteish orange, apparently hovering or standing still, about the size of a dime held at arm's length. An unusual sighting. It moved in a very erratic manner, darting back and forth, up and down, then suddenly accelerating and disappearing from sight in 2 or 3 seconds. It made no sound. I was amazed and fascinated by it, and felt it could not be a normal aircraft or other known object. It was seen by myself and several others, and I believe the incident was reported at the time to the authorities, though I do not know if any investigation was made. I would be most interested in any information or explanation the Air Force could provide about this incident."

Florence, Italy
July 14, 1966

First of all I don't think I am sending this letter to the proper office but I have no addresses with me. Therefore, if you cannot help me, please refer this letter to someone who can.

I am presently studying at the Florence campus of Stanford University. We terminated our first quarter of study on June 16 and began our second quarter of study on June 27. I had a very curious phenomenon for which I would like an explanation.

On the night of June 13 at about 9:30, the site of our residence hall there appeared in the sky a strange object. This object had the shape of a flattened disk or oval and was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any aircraft that I am familiar with. It was completely silent and seemed to be hovering over the countryside. After hovering for about 30 seconds, it suddenly shot away at a fantastic rate of speed, disappearing in a matter of seconds. I was utterly amazed at this sight and as I lay down on my back examining it, I say it would be about the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length. It was a steady white light, not blinking, and seemed to be self-luminous. I have never seen anything like it before and as I said, I am at a loss to explain what it could have been. There was a milky shape surrounding the light, almost like a halo. I tried to wake up some of the other students to look at it but it disappeared before I could get them to see it.

To change the subject for a moment, I looked up to the sky suddenly it seemed to be the glow. Suddenly it seemed to be the glow. Suddenly it seemed to the growing dawn, and becoming more and more brilliant. Then intense white light flooded the horizon area and quickly seemed to spread and fill the sky above us. This light was so intense that it frightened me and I sat up thinking that the place was on fire. But as I glanced around, I saw nothing burning and the light slowly dimmed and disappeared. This happened within about 45 seconds. I was all alone at the time and truly frightened by this strange light phenomenon. I say I did not know.

Dear Sir,--
This may have no bearing whatever on the article... ...which reached me mentioning noises and strange vibrations, especially mentioning sounds coming out of the sky between five and five-thirty Saturday morning. there just might be some connection with these space radios. 
I live in one of the small hillside village on the mountain side which is a mile south of town and just on the other side of Portneuf River. with peace and quiet. No so much as the birds and the roar of cars since I sleep on enclosed porch in front of cottage.-- I live alone ill sums.

Here, I was awake at the time the voices woke me. First it sounded like two persons talking on the road.-- I heard no car so it was very quiet of coarse, Just a distant murmer. It broke off quiet suddenly as if the persons had just stopped walking on this road. Then I plainly heard that the voices were not on the road but coming from the sky. The dog did bark at strangers. Only a few. At the time I doubted if anyone else heard it as I have no radios. I got up and loked out but no one there went back to bed but it seemed to be a long time before I could sleep again. It was eerie and I was worn thinking of what it could be.

I am my nephew's dependent. He works at the local place for me. He heard nothing but his cabin is in trees and bushes. 

I don't know the cause but it seems to me to be something around aeroplanes and yet so strange that no one can understand them. It's puzzled.

My nephew heard nothing but his cabin is surrounded with trees and bushes. I am the aunt who made the tower yesterday. We do not account for the voice or tell anyone as some may think we are silly. If there is something in the towers we do hope the towers are sailor have some use.

Please let me know if you find anything that might throw any light on this. I am on high hill in.

The image appears to contain a technical analysis report for a UFO sighting. There is no photograph included in this particular page of the document. 

The text in the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 55-44
SUBJECT: UFO ANALYSIS
LOCATION: LEGAO, ALBAY, PHILIPPINES
DATE: 27 JUNE 1955
P HTR 259 1235

1. PURPOSE: To analyze photographs of purported UFO's that was taken by Mr. Jose C. Tuican at Legao, Albay, Philippines. These photographs were forwarded by the Chief of the Philippine Air Force for analysis.
2. PHOTOGRAPHY: The photographs were received in cut into two sections at frame number 4, and torn at frame number 5. The film is identified as 16mm Safety "Kodalith" film which is panchromatic black-and-white (sic) film used for aerial photography at the Republic of the Philippines.
3. ANALYSIS: The images on the film appear to be that of a luminous, elliptical-shaped object which are inhomogeneous along the longitudinal axis. The emission spectrum of this object, as determined from the density-versus-wavelength curve, indicates the existence of several emissions, primarily in the ultra-violet and blue-green regions of the spectrum.
4. INTERPRETATION: The results of the analysis indicate that the images on the film represent an unidentified aerial object, possibly a UFO. A consideration of the spectral analysis and the general nature of the object indicate that the object may have been a natural phenomenon rather than an artificial craft. However, since the object was photographed at some distance, and the quality of the images is not optimum, a definitive identification cannot be made based solely on the film record. The image dimensions and brightness suggest that the object may have been relatively large and bright.
5. CONCLUSION: The film record does not provide sufficient data to determine the exact nature of the object photographed. However, the available evidence does not permit a definitive identification as a conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon. An attempt should be made to obtain additional photographic or other data on this object to permit a more conclusive analysis. 
Following is an analysis of the aforementioned materials:
Frame No. 1 -The character indicates to be consistent 31 messages to be deciphered, and encloses an area in brackets approximately 2 inches wide. Is this the only message or are the one or more to be assumed ?

The image appears to contain a typed document or report, but does not seem to include any photographs. The text in the document appears to be discussing various methods of photo analysis that could be applied to a specific photograph, but no actual photograph is present in the image provided.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 55-11. DATED 16 November 1955

There are several methods by which this photograph could be made. These methods could have been highly or in combination:

1. Double printing technique, utilizing a positive transparency in register over the negative.

2. Multiple exposure technique by first photographing the basic scene then painting the camera lens, excluding and smoothly transitioning a smaller or differently lit scene portion. This could give a "pulsating" light effect.

3. Recording the basic scene and adding and deleting elements such as a small light source in front of the lens is obtain the "pulsating" light effect.

Frame #2 - This appears to have been done with two separate exposures, possibly from two different cameras or film. Teticings a & b and c and d are identical in general shape differing only in width. This suggests a double exposure, with different lighting sources on the camera, by opening the shutter and uniformly "painting" the image an different areas of the frame.

Frame #3 - The invisible, transparent, and weightless appearance identified as "a" is in essence a stereoscopic image (presumably from either of the lights or camera). From this, it could have been accomplished by the aforementioned double printing techniques. (See frame #1)

Frame #5 - The analysis was made of the length of the star trace versus time to correlate the stated measure time and distances, utilizing multiple techniques.

SUBJECT: UFO ANALYSIS
LOCATION: LIGAO, ALBAY, PHILIPPINES 
DATE: 27 JUNE 1966
AT: 
P NO.: 899-text
1. PURPOSE: To analyze photography of purported UFOs that was taken by Mr. (name redacted) in order to try and define the cause of the UFO's appearance. The following materials were furnished TDSP for analysis: Copy (1) 13 exposure roll, size 120.
2. ANALYSIS: Reference: FTD Form 154 
Paragraph 1 - The observer's statement indicates his UFO was observed at a high altitude. 
Paragraph 2 - If these conditions for weightlessness, invisibility, silence, and inertia are inherent characteristics of the objects as described, the observer fails to record these on his camera. 
Paragraph 3 - According to this paragraph the observer covers almost any attempt to identify and conclusively disprove that the images were indeed moving lights photographed with a very camera.
Following is an analysis of the aforementioned materials:
Frame #1 - The observer indicates in comment 3 messages to be deciphered, and suggest an analysis of the photograph to determine whether this is the only message.

- page 47 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a text document describing the analysis of an unidentified object or phenomenon. The text discusses various photographic techniques and analysis methods used to examine the object, including double exposure, the use of a black background, and microscopic examination of the negatives. The text also references the identification of certain features and characteristics, but does not provide any further details about the nature of the object itself.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 66-14 DATED 16 NOVEMBER 1966.

There are several methods by which this photograph could have been made. These methods could have been used singly or in combination:

A. Positive printing technique, utilizing a positive transparency in register over the negative.

B. Double exposure technique, utilizing the basic scene then painting the camera at a black background and somehow randomly moving a small light source across in front of the lens to obtain the "pulsing" light effect.

C. Recording the basic scene and waiting until lights 1, 4, 7, and 5 are extinguished and then placing one or several small light sources at the scene and randomly exposing the camera. This has the general appearance of strongly suggesting that this camera was deliberately utilized.

Frame #2 - This appears to have been done with two separate exposures, possibly from two different cameras.

Tracings a, b, c, and d are identical in general shape differing only in width. This was accomplished by using an anamorphic lens on the camera, slightly deforming and imaging four separate but similar exposures or patterns.

Frame #3 - The invisible, translucent, and weightless appearance identified as "3" is possibly a third exposure. A microscopic analysis of the frame shows two light image-like patterns within the area marked.

Frame #4 - Within the area marked "1" a microscopic examination of the negative reveals several bright spots and possibly also images of the moon, again indicating multiple exposures.

From #5 - An analysis was made of the length of the apparent exposure time with the actual exposure time. As before, this photograph could be duplicated.

- page 48 -

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report with text describing and analyzing photographic evidence.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 55-44, DATED 16 November 1966

Frames #6, #7, #8 and #9 - Once again, multiple moon images indicate that several different exposures were made.

Frame #10 - In frame number 19, it appears as though the camera was swung to two different light sources in order to make two tracings.

Frame #11 - Two, possibly three, exposures were utilized to make this photography in a dual-imaged background.

Frame #12 - The spaceship is in an ideal location and approximately the correct intensity that would correspond to the peculiar highlight on the front element of a camera lens pointed directly at a bright light.

Frame #13 - This is probably a single exposure since the moon image is smaller than in the other frames. Once again the spaceship is probably a peculiar highlight caused by the light source to the lower left.

It is the considered opinion of this office that the furnished materials and photographs represent primary evidence that the imagery was allegedly created by the Chief, Photo Analysis Branch.

1. I believe that the type of objects that I have discovered are invisible to our naked eye and can only be seen or recorded through the film of a camera. These flying craft are genuine and can be heard by many people who saw them.
2. I believe that my discovery is entirely different from any other material objects which are now known to many people who saw them.
3. I believe these spaceships which are invisible, colorless, soundless and used by these super-intelligent beings who have landed or crashed in Idaho and for more accurate records are far more interesting than all stories about the flying saucers.
4. An ordinary flying machine is strictly recognized on the basis of their color, shape and light. These ships have no light or produce any sound even while walking on them.
5. Their occupants are in an extra-terrestrial state which one could not imagine from the human point of view. These beings are as unimaginable as the difference between a man and a dog.
6. Their spaceships are round and transparent tall shape covering and all transport will shape and are all invisible to the naked eye.
7. These crafts are difficult to approach on bright moonlit nights but also difficult to see on dark nights (K.I.A.).
8. Their walk on light rays usually pulsating lights of different colors may indicate life forms from higher intelligence. They have the precision of an electronic machine while critining in space.

I am indeed very glad that my letter to his Excellency President Johnson has been duly attended to and that I have acknowledged receipt of his letter of August 1, 1966 and correspondence with Major Holt, relative to the UFO landings, witnessed by me on August 1, 1966 and acknowledged by the undersigned September 12, 1966.

In compliance with the letter, that I furnished the negatives together with the transparencies, which were submitted with the letter, I am enclosing herewith the pictures of the 203 together with their corresponding prints.

Hontarron's instructions to contact me if you do not have sufficient for release, par its publication. I have written to him to hold this in abeyance until you give further instructions as Hontarron's was very anxious to confirm his report which he made during the past week and is still available to your good office for further clarification. Please advise me of your decision in this matter at the earliest opportunity.

In case I can be of any assistance, I hope I can be of help to your good office through my discovery of these unidentifiable UFOs.

The text of the letter is as follows:

Air Force Headquarters (SAFDICC)
Washington, D.C. 20330

Dear Sir:

Last December 12, 1966, I have forwarded to your good office a follow-up letter to my previous letter of Sept. 16, 1966, containing my answers to Air Force Hqs. about my discovery of UFO's in my hometown of Ligao, Albay, R.P.

In view of your continued silence regarding my request for proper analysis and deciphering of the somewhat coded messages which these UFO's were trying to impart to me, I have become more and more convinced that you have unfortunately laid aside my negatives which I badly need for my personal research and collection as they show the prints as your office for further study and research, so that in case you have interests/facts regarding the matter, you can legally contact me for any other important opinions which will be of importance to your space research.

At the present time, I have developed a keener interest in these UFO sightings which I have personally observed on several occasions together with other citizens of my town, which are really of interest and which delve deeper into this age of modern science and space travel. I am anxiously keeping for myself whatever information I gather, if you won't even bother sending me your reply to my request for these negatives which will give importance and will value these discoveries. I am still giving you ample time to do something, whether this is a project Blue Book or not, I firmly believe that this category is not even recorded in your project Blue Book but was passed to me by your office and therefore this I consider a unique discovery which no history and any book of visible life has pertained to these invisible beings.

In closing therefore, I am still very eager to know your ideas and thoughts regarding my discovery of which I am very confident that in the long run your good office will be able to realize the importance of these phenomena and programs which are costing the U.S. government billions of dollars as well as human resources in their effort to uncover the truth surrounding these invisible beings.

Air Force Headquarters (SAFPICC)
Washington, D.C. 20330

Sirs:

I am too eager to be informed as to the status of my previous letter of September 15, 1966 which contained some information on UFO's.

Please be informed that our letter of the above-mentioned date containing (1) roll of UFO's negatives containing 13 frames and (1) Accomplished FTD Forms which were acknowledged by your department so as to clarify science and technology.

During the time interval when I sent my letter as on September 16, 1966 up to now, there are other people who have engaged and observed these moving objects. An employee of the Abaco Corporation of the Philippines, which is opposite my house, reported sighting of their space ship in different types of aircrafts and four different kinds of films I have taken of these UFO's. The results are the same. Up to this time, these UFO's and these would be added to my previous pictures I have taken from September 16, 1966 up to now.

There are several many passages which are hard to describe and another form is to indicate its position location in the other pictures.

Sir, if and when you have acknowledge my previous letter, please inform the undersigned as to its evaluation, there as we are only waiting when you will be pleased to me due to your silence pertaining to my request. Upon receipt of your good-pictures, I am willing to send for your good-pictures again I am willing to send for your good-pictures as soon as I received those taken the request and the full guarantee that they will be returned to me.

In this regard, I hope you will take more interest in this discovery if they are of relation to the present age of.

In closing I wish you all in your department a Merry Christmas and a Prosperous New Year.

Yours truly,

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a document titled "PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT" and it describes the analysis of photography of a purported UFO sighting that was taken by Mr. Jose C. Tucian in Iloilo, Aklay, Philippines on June 27, 1966.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 65-44

SUBJECT: UFO ANALYSIS
LOCATION: ILOILO, AKLAY, PHILIPPINES 
DATE: 27 JUNE 1966

1. PURPOSE: To analyse photography of purported UFO's that was taken by Mr. Jose C. Tucian.

2. ANALYSIS: Reference: TM FM 11-4, Section 33, Paragraph 1. The observers statement of the electromagnetic disturbance caused by the object and its abnormal speed and silence, which are indicators of possible intelligence guided flight, and of the apparent short wave length and electromagnetic spectrum of the object, make it desirable to further analyze this photograph.

3. The film used by the observer has the characteristic sensitivity to infrared radiation and the electromagnetic spectrum of the apparent object, which enables standard films to be modified in order to extend their sensitivity toward the infrared region of the spectrum. 

4. Reference: Paragraph 13 - In this paragraph the observer covers the fact that while exposed, the film was damaged, resulting in the deterioration of these film records by stating that "frames 1-8 were destroyed". The rest of the statement seems to be indecipherable.

DATE OF REPORT: 5 November 1966

The provided image does not contain any photograph or visual element. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, specifically report #65-44, dated 16 November 1966, titled "UFO Analysis", focusing on a location in Lagao, Arayat, Philippines.

The text of the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 65-44
PAGE 1 OF 3 PAGES
DATE OF REPORT: 16 NOVEMBER 1966

SUBJECT: UFO ANALYSIS
LOCATION: LAGAO, ARAYAT, PHILIPPINES
DATE: 27 JUNE 1966

PURPOSE: To analyze photography of purported UFO's that was taken by [redacted] in order to try and define the cause of the UFO's. The following materials were furnished TDDC for analysis: Photographs (11) exposed rolls, size 120; Filters (4) used and spliced back together at frame number 10; Film is identified as FUN Safety Nepah Halfax; Certificate (1) list of the Republic of the Philippines.

ANALYSIS: Reference: AF Form 14, Section 15, Paragraph 1 - The observer's statement of the facts pertaining to the incident which are given in full is considered completely true in that all material appearing on the photograph and of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The film used by the observer has an unusually high sensitivity in the infrared region of the spectrum. This indicates that the camera used may be modified in order to extend its range.

Reference: AF Form 14, Section 14, Paragraph 4 - If these conditions, i.e., exposureness, resolution, focus, perspective, etc. are indicated to be satisfactory, one is warranted in placing full faith in the methods of knowing when, where, and how to record these phenomena.

Reference: AF Form 14, Section 14, Paragraph 16 - In this paragraph the observer covers the procedures of how the photographs were taken, developed, and duplicated by the imagery laboratory.

Following is an analysis of the aforementioned materials:

PARAGRAPH 1 - The observer indicates in comment 61 messages to be discarded, and considers them unimportant or extraneous information to this case. The only messages that the observer indicates are important are those numbered 62, 63, and 64.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 65-44 . DATED 15 NOVEMBER 1966

Frames #5, #7, #8 and #9 - Once again, multiple moon images indicate that several exposures were used. 

Frame #10 - In frame number 10, it appears as though the camera was swung to two different positions against the background to make two tracings.

Frame #11 - Two, possibly three, exposures were utilized to make this photography as indicated by the doubled background exposures. 

Frame #12 - The spacecraft is in an ideal location and approximately the correct intensity to be an artificial satellite. The highlighted areas on this frame would correspond to the brightest lights on the spacecraft.

Frame #13 - This is again a multiple exposure, with a bright image that is more distinct as in several of the other frames. Once again the door in the central portion for a regular light source.

The report concludes by stating that the furnished materials and photographs do not prove the imagery was deliberately created by the photographer.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed report with analyses of multiple moon images. The report number is 55-11, dated 16 November 1966, and it discusses the findings from frames #5, #7, #8, and #9, which indicate multiple moon images, as well as frame #10, which appears to have been taken with the camera swung to two different light traces, and frames #11 and #12, which discuss the appearance and location of the spacecraft. The report concludes that the furnished materials and photographs do not represent imagery of spacecraft and that they were deliberately created by the photographer. The report is approved by Charles Chaffin, Photographic Technician, and William L. Turner, Chief, Photo Analysis Branch.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO.: 55-11, DATED 16 NOVEMBER 1966
Frames #5, #7, #8 and #9 - Once again, multiple moon images indicate that several exposures were used.
Frame #10 - In frame number 10, it appears as though the camera was swung to two different light traces.
Frame #11 - Two, possibly three, exposures were utilized to make this photography, as indicated by the slight back-ground displacement.
Frame #12 - The spacecraft is in an ideal location and approximately the correct intensity for an internal camera lens reflection. The spacecraft is probably a secondary image, since the flight traces would not normally extend directly as a bright light.
Frame #13 - This is probably a single exposure since the moon image is smeared rather than distinct as in several of the other frames. Once again the spacecraft is probably a secondary image in the correct position for a specular highlight.
It is the considered opinion of this office that the furnished materials and photographs do not represent imagery of spacecraft and that they were deliberately created by the photographer.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document with text describing various photographic analysis techniques used in Project Blue Book, such as double printing, double exposure, and recording the basic scene and waiting until lights are extinguished. The text provides detailed technical information about the methods used to analyze these types of photographic evidence.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NO. 66-14, DATED 16 NOVEMBER 1966

There are several methods by which this photograph could have been used. These methods could have been used singly or in combination:

a. Possible printing technique, utilizing a positive transparency in register over the negative.

b. Double exposure technique by first photographing the basic scene then pointing the camera at a black background and somehow randomly moving a small light source across the field of view to produce a continuous motion picture type shutter effect.

c. Recording the basic scene and waiting until lights 1, 4, 2, and 5 are extinguished and then placing one or several small light sources randomly behind the camera. Several extremely similar patterns exist in frame 1, strongly suggesting that this method has been used.

Frame #2 - This appears to have been done with two separate exposures, possibly from two different locations.

Traings 1, 2, 3, and 4 are identical in general shape differing only in width. This indicates that they were produced by the same source, presumably a small light or lighted object, moving or rotating rapidly so as to produce these traces. The two "traces" numbered "12" are identical and appear to constitute a mirror image of the others, suggesting a symmetrical arrangement or possibly a reflection.

Frame #3 - This appears to have been multiple exposures, possibly an intentional double or multiple exposure to produce the identical traings labeled as "3" in the print, indicating that at least four distinct exposures were made.

Frame #4 - Within this area marked "1" is a microscopic examination of the negative reveals what appears to be and possibly are images of the moon, again indicating multiple exposures were used.

There are time markings and possibly time indications on the film, which could be utilized to correlate the stated times with the actual exposure times. This photograph could be duplicated.

- page 74 -

The image appears to contain a photographic negative or print showing three distinct segments or frames. The frames appear to depict some kind of aerial or celestial phenomenon, with bright, luminous shapes visible against a dark background. However, the quality and resolution of the image make it difficult to discern any specific details or identify the nature of the observed objects.
