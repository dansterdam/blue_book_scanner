11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Four or five observed this object in the sky which appeared to be a round or oval object with lights on it. It appeared to be maneuvering and at one point seemed to stop and hover. After approximately 5 hours it moved off to the north. The object was described as being about 25-30 feet in diameter and seemed to have colored lights on it. No positive identification could be made as to the nature of this object.

The image contains a diagram with instructions related to sighting and observing unidentified flying objects (UFOs). There is a compass rose and a sketch of a landscape with the horizon line. The instructions ask the viewer to mark the location and direction of the observed object on the diagram. There is no photograph present in this image.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

27. In the sketch, imagine that you are at the point marked "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place an "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which is an old UFO report. The text on the page describes an observed object with some details about its appearance and movements.

Text from the document:

For the record:

I spotted an object with a slight gliding motion several feet from the ground. The object hovered for several minutes, about 12 feet off the ground, possibly 15 feet in diameter. It appeared to be about 20 minutes before setting on the ground. It was about the same size as a manhole cover, maybe slightly larger. After the object appeared to land, the area was soon observed by various persons, including myself. The object was tilted at an angle and did not appear to be secured to the ground. It had a dull silver color and no visible markings or windows. After the object departed, the area was approached, but there was no apparent evidence of its having been there. The ground did not appear to have been disturbed. It appeared to lift off easily and depart rapidly without any noise or fumes. The entire incident lasted approximately 15-20 minutes.

Dear sir:

I wish to report the sighting of an unidentified flying object that occurred on June 4, 1966 at about 9:30 p.m. EDT. The object was first sighted hovering over my home for a few seconds. It then rapidly moved off to the southeast, rising to an altitude of about 5,000 feet. The object appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and was brightly lit, emitting a bluish-white light. It seemed to be oval or saucer-shaped in appearance. The object moved with no sound and at a very high rate of speed. The sighting lasted only about 15 seconds.

This is part of a report of Case # 3 of Charlotte, N.C. dated June 20, 1966.

THE SECRETARY
CHARLOTTE, N.C. 
JULY 20, 1956

Dear Sir:

I might as well let the world know about this... I cannot think of a thing to do about it but tell you. I have never seen anything like this before and I can't even imagine what it is. Only this other man who was with me saw it. It was one of the most unearthly things I have ever seen. It isn't like anything I've encountered before, and the boys around here think I'm seeing things. But I know I did see it, and the other man who was with me saw it too. He said he never saw anything like it before, and he is experienced in observing mechanical things. We both noticed it at the same time. 

This is about the size of an average bath tub and it has a dull gray color. It seems to be made of some sort of metal. It hangs about 100 feet in the air and is perfectly motionless. It appears to be slightly elliptical in shape. It neither goes up, down, nor sideways. It just hangs there, in the air, and doesn't seem to be supported by anything. I'm not able to explain it, but it's there. The other man and I watched it for about ten minutes until it suddenly became obscured from our view by some trees. We waited around for awhile to see if it would reappear, but it didn't. 

I would appreciate it if you could give me some idea of what this thing is... Where it came from, what it is, and where it went. I am very much puzzled by this incident and I would be glad to furnish you with any other information that might be of help in clearing this up. Can you tell me anything about it?

Sincerely yours,
[SIGNATURE]
