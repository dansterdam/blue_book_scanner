Subject: Declared vision of Flying Saucer.

Dear Sir:

On Thursday, September 5th, 1957 at approximately 9:10 P.M., I sighted and observed a flying saucer in the northwest section of the sky. It was a metallic disc-like object, with a glow of some sort of light emanating from its underside, and also viewed the object as it passed from the said position to the northwest direction. 

This information is reported to you for what it is worth. There were no pictures taken and it is reported that anybody else viewed this so-called Flying Saucer.
