FLIGHT 3-D, 46023 AISS
I. SOURCE:
Address: Baltimore, Maryland
Age: 28
Occupation: Salesman
Education: 12 years
Qualifications: Former U.S. Navy aerial Photographer
II. RELIABILITY:
Investigators stay in the Baltimore area to follow up on an appointment with SOURCE was set up through an intermediary. However, investigators learned through a phone conversation, SOURCE gave the impression that he was definite in his statements, even though he was definitely sincere in his statements.
III. INFORMATION:
1. SOURCE described a peculiar experience in his home when, on a previous occasion object apparently appeared in the southwest at approximately 13/02/52 through a window. It seemed to remain at a constant position during the sighting. The object shaped appeared to be of a distinct individual flight, a disc with a definite outline and a glowing front half or underside.
2. The palm of the hand of the object could be compared to a searchlight and its brilliance was of such intensity that it would be hard to estimate as the bald object appeared to be traveling at 9,000 m.p.h.
3. SOURCE described objects as being solid with an appearance similar to that of a model airplane fuselage - SOURCE further stated that unless this country or some other country is far advanced in aircraft design, he believes it would be difficult to fabricate such an object.
4. SOURCE described the sky as being dark with a few scattered stars and the sound of a whining sounding varying in pitch as not distinctive - the object did not seem to be larger than a man's hand when viewed from SOURCE's position, was not in motion and there was no smoke or vapor trail discernible.

2. The CAA office in Washington, D.C. (G/JT 00533) indicated that the only unusual phenomena in the vicinity of Baltimore was an advertizing aircraft.
3. The control tower at Friendship International Airport in Baltimore, Md. stated that the only unusual phenomena in the area was an advertising aircraft with various markings circling the Baltimore area at approximately 15202002 Jan 56 for an unknown period of time.
4. A check with the control tower at Friendship Airport in Baltimore indicated the following data: Altitude: Unlimited. Speed: (230) knots. Ceiling: 30,000 feet.
5. Mr. Schoenbach, Air Verifying Co. of 17 Guilford Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, was contacted, and he stated that at the time when the alleged UFO was sighted, he was operating an advertising aircraft in the area.

6. The information received from the USAF Weather Officer at Andrews AFB, Maryland (3/43) indicated the wind direction and velocity in degrees and knots as follows:
Surface - 240° - 7 20,000 - 320° - 7
10,000 - 310° - 16 30,000 - 340° - 21
15,000 - 320° - 16 40,000 - 350° - 24

However, due to the number of reports received, the 647th ACAW scrambled an F-86 at 15022302 Jun 56 from the Suffolk, Va. Airport to investigate, but the pilot stated that it was hazy at 30,000 feet and above in the Baltimore area.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
a. The Preparing Officer concludes that this sighting was definitely caused by advertising aircraft. The time of sighting and the flying time of the advertising aircraft were approximately the same. 
b. The course of the advertising aircraft coincides with the approximate course of the object, as described in Part II.
c. Lighting as described by SOURCE in Part II would be the same as that on the advertising aircraft.
d. Due to negative radar contact accomplished by the 647th ACGW Squadron, scrambled from 29th FIS and Andrews AFB, Md., poor visibility could give varied impressions of a strange object.
e. The time that was given was approximately 45 minutes, pilot of the J-45D could not properly identify any object.
f. The Air Defense Command and the FBI indicated that no unusual phenomena were evident in the area at the time of sighting.
g. All agencies that were cognizant of the advertising aircraft and were able to identify it as such.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER: 
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was caused by the advertising aircraft described in this report.
