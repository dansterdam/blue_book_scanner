29. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object?
(Girard ca.): No.
29.1 If yes, describe who, etc. and the object too.
(Girard cont.): No.
29.2 Please indicate any other witnesses.
(Girard cont.): No.

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important. Use additional pages if necessary.
The object appeared to be very large - it appeared to be the size of a 4-engine airliner, but it had no wings. It was illuminated as though by a spotlight, but there was no visible source of illumination. It moved rapidly and silently. There were small round objects with lights on them, moving around the large object, and these lights appeared to be blinking. At one point, the large object appeared to split into two, but they reunited after a short time. The object then descended rapidly in a slightly spiral motion, and I could see it for at least 10 minutes. I had a feeling of awe and wonder rather than fear.

McDonald Observatory
22 June 1953

1st Lt. Robert Olason
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olason,

Here are the comments on the recent batch of material. A few cases are certainly of considerable interest. Over 20 April in Ticonderoga Venus counts for 6 cases; balloons for 4 more counts for 3 cases; Stuttgart - Fireballs most probably account for 4 cases.

Coming to the interesting cases: the Korean 20 April should certainly be followed up. This seems very close to being a satellite. The intelligence matter is quite interesting. How about sending a few Form A to officers occasionally wish information on this? How about trying to spot by intelligence officers?

Pepperhill AFB 2 May: This has some similarities to the old German cases. Much similar material needed and Form A should be sent if this has not already been done.

San Antonio 7 May: This has many similarities to the Lubbock Lights and Form A should certainly be sent if this has not already been done. 

Finally, a Form A for the 29 April Syracuse stationary-disc sighting. The lighting might have been jet, but the green light sighting, etc. should have been investigated more.

I hope that you can eventually send me more information on these: 20 April; 2 May; Pepperhill; 7 May San Antonio.

I am enclosing my version of a report on our recent trip with which I hope you will concur. And keep 'em coming. It's easier to handle a few at a time and frequently than a larger batch at longer intervals. Jennie send her regards.

IN REPLY TO CABLE APGIR CG TO A-1494 CONCERNING A DEVICE THAT HAS THE SHAPE OF THE CAMECA FLAKE MARK II DEVICE AND IS SIMILAR TO IT IN OPERATION. IT IS ALSO OF HIGH IMPORTANCE TO GENERAL PATARIGUE.

6. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF INVENTION: THE INVENTION CLAIMS TO HAVE DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED A FREE FLYING OBJECT THAT IS CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN USED IN ITALY BEFORE WORLD WAR II. ACCOUNTS OF THESE DEVICES ARE SHOWN IN ENCLOSURES. THE INVENTION IS DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT AS FOLLOWS: IT IS THE ONLY TIME THAT THE CLAIMS THAT THE PLANS FOR THESE DEVICES WERE DESTROYED ARE NOT SUBSTANTIATED IN THIS REPORT. 

DURING THESE TESTS THE MODEL WAS OFFICIALLY CHECKED BY FRENCH OFFICIALS. IT IS ABOUT 1300 POUNDS IN WEIGHT. IT APPEARS TO RESEMBLE A TYPICAL UFO SIGHTING AS REGARDS DIMENSIONS AND METHOD OF OPERATION FROM INFORMATION RECEIVED.

THE PRESENT MODEL IS IN THE HANDS OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT. INCIDENTALLY, NO ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO COVERTLY OBSTRUCT THESE EXPERIMENTS BY FRENCH OFFICIALS OR INFLUENCE THE MODEL OR PATENTS RIGHTS ASSIGNED TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT AND DEALERS HIMSELF.

Text extracted from the document:

TO: CONTROL SYSTEM. The control system is centered in the gyro-stabilized platform that forms the inner hull of the device. This control system is large enough to accommodate a small pilot and may be remotely controlled from the ground. It is possible to put the model into any flight attitude desired. Banks up to 45° are possible, but will not affect the device. The stabilization is such that the control system maintains equilibrium and orientation regardless of the vehicle's attitude. Three controls are provided, namely: fuel metering, climb and dive.

RELATIONSHIP TO DESIGN FOR DESIGN. The inventor claims that the designs that have been made for the device are similar to those of present aircraft, that and this is flying, and that the design is now in the process of being put into effect.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER. The inventor has presented this office with a full statement of his claims for the device. As a technical office, we are not in a position to evaluate these claims. However, he has requested that the identity of the device be kept confidential. The idea and its details have been presented to this office for further government consideration. No further information from this source is available at this time.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: VISAO INTELLIGENCE OFFICE

SUBJECT: Unidentified objects sighted by Mr. [REDACTED], Drive, San Antonio, Texas, on 27 May 1953 from 2030 to 2045 hours.

On Wednesday night, May 27, 1953, at approximately 8:30 P.M., I was called by your home office to investigate a call which had originated at [REDACTED] which was designated as being very unusual. When I observed the object, it was hovering over a residential area about 1/2 mile to the southwest of my location. The object appeared to be a metallic, star-like object, quite as white as a star but larger. This object had rapid, perpendicular movements and remained in the air for approximately 15 minutes. The object seemed to be very high, that it looked almost stationary. I observed it through binoculars and it was about the size of a baseball at arm's length. It made no sound whatsoever and seemed to be completely under control. I could distinguish no shape or outline as it appeared round. At times it appeared to burst out into a fluorescent glow of yellowish-white. It would remain stationary for a few seconds and then dart off in a straight line at a very high rate of speed and make an abrupt turn and return to its original position. On several occasions it appeared to shoot off a smaller object which would dart out a short distance and return. I continued to watch the object and follow it as it remained in the area for approximately 20 minutes. I then lost sight of it as it seemed to merge into the sky and disappear.

STATEMENT

At about 8:55, May 7, 1953, I was at my residence at *** *************, San Antonio, Texas. I had just taken three steps and was going to the front porch and was going to tell the stars and define a group of objects. I looked out at many objects of small size in the southwest sky at about a forty-five degree angle from my vision. These objects were very bright. When I first saw them there were only two or three impressions in a split second. At first I thought it was a star constellation. But they were growing in number and became more numerous, as many as ten or fifteen. I became confused and could not count them. I decided to go into the house and get an airplane because there were too many lights and the object appeared to be too big. I walked to the middle of the yard to get a better look at it and as I got out there it appeared almost overhead. At other times when I watched the sky, I have been witness to seeing the lighted navigation lights of an airplane, and this did not appear to be like any airplane because the lights were too large and too big. There were eight or ten of these lights pasted at regular intervals towards the top of the object for those lights seemed to form a perfect semi-circle. As it passed overhead, I could see the outline of the object. It was very distinctly oval. I can say that the object was as large as a house, at least forty or fifty feet across. It made no noise whatever. I was amazed and could hardly contain my speech. The things that struck me as being so peculiar that an aircraft that size could be so clearly seen yet make no sound. It was moving in a straight line on a definite course in a north-easterly direction. I would estimate the speed to be as less as one hundred miles per hour, but very steady and constant. When I first saw the object I viewed it from the back yard but there is a big pecan tree in the back yard and by the time I took a clear view all together it could have been that the house and the tree in the back yard had disappearance. Another thing I noticed was that the object itself, it looked dark. I couldn't determine the color of the object itself, it was illuminated by the reflection of the lights and if any color could describe it, I would say that it was dark gray.

I certify that this statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
