There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with text instructions and questions.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar? 

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or some's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The image contains three different sketches or illustrations. The first sketch depicts a curved line with a high object above the horizon, suggesting an unidentified flying object (UFO). The second sketch shows a person walking on a road or path with a landscape in the background. The third sketch shows a silhouetted landscape with a person in the foreground.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:
32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) that you saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline).

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The text in the document has been redacted, so I will not be able to produce the full text output. I can only describe the content and structure of the form, without identifying any individuals or revealing the redacted information.

The document appears to be a questionnaire or report form related to the sighting of an unidentified object. It contains various questions about the weather conditions, when and where the object was seen, whether anyone else was present, and the observer's opinion on what the object was and what might have caused it. The form includes check boxes and spaces for the observer to provide written responses.

The image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The larger sketch on the left depicts a curved line rising above the horizon, representing how high an object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The smaller sketches on the right show a person's perspective of the object at the point when it was first observed (marked as "A") and when it was last seen (marked as "B").
