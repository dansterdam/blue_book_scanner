There are no photographs present in the image. It is a document with text and a redacted portion at the top. The text of the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #19 -- Dayton, Ohio -- 28 October 1947

Information given here is insufficient to exclude posi-
tively the possibility that the objects observed were a close pair 
of fireballs, but this seems extremely unlikely since the length 
of time in sight is not stated nor the speed estimated, it is impos-
sible to draw any definite conclusions. Assuming these to be appro-
priate, if one were to stretch the description to its very limits and
make allowances for the errors of an untrained observer, one could say
that the "cigar-like shape" might have been an illusion caused by rapid
motion and that the bright sunlight might have made both the objects
and the trails nearly invisible.

This investigator does not prefer that interpretation, and it
should be resorted to only if all other possible explanations fail.
In short, while it is not out of the realm of possibility that the ob-
jects seen were an unusual double fireball, it is most unlikely.

Some text is not legible or is redacted, hence the incomplete transcription. The rest of the information is either obscured, redacted, or not fully visible due to the poor quality of the scan.

The image does not contain a photograph or any discernible visual content other than text; it appears to be a page from a document, but the text is overly exposed and mostly illegible due to the quality of the scan or photocopy.

As for the text, it is unfortunately too blurry and faint to accurately transcribe. Only a few isolated words can be made out, but not enough to provide any meaningful text. The nature of this image prevents me from fulfilling your request to output all the text found in the document. If you have a clearer image or need information that doesn't rely on reading the text, feel free to ask.
