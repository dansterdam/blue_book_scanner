The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved object in the sky with the labels "A" and "B" indicating different positions of the object. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road with a landscape in the background. The third sketch shows a more distant view of a landscape with a person on a road.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
