SPECIAL INQUIRY

TO:  Director of Special Investigations

Washington 25, D.C.

1. The following information and attached photographs are being forwarded to your office for any action deemed necessary:

On 26 April 1954, the United States Air Force Station at Mildenhall, England, recovered an unidentified object which had been observed by personnel in the area. ASSISTANT PROVOST MARSHAL, 3910th Air Base Group, RAF Station Mildenhall, advised WILLIAM SCARBROUGH and WILLIAM GARS, adjacent to the base, that the object had been recovered. It was described as approximately five (5) feet in diameter and weighing approximately six (6) ounces. Attached to the object was a sphere approximately five feet (5' x 5') which was suspended by pieces of binders twine from the object. No identifying markings were noted on the sphere or the object. The fabric of the balloon was a pale yellow, and the sphere appeared to have been carefully folded and attached to the object. The object was first seen at approximately 1600 hours on 26 April 1954. It landed in a tree line to the base in the area of Air Installations Section. Cognizance was assumed by the United Kingdom in an attempt to have the object identified. Special Agent SCARBROUGH made a telephone call to Special Investigations Branch, which time he spoke to the Duty Officer concerning the object.

The Duty Officer assured Special Agent SCARBROUGH that the object would receive appropriate attention.
