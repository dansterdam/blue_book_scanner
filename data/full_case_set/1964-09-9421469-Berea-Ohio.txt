Dear Sir:

At 2:45 PM, September 21, 1964, this office was contacted telephonically concerning a sighting of an unidentified flying object over Berea, Ohio, on September 21, 1964.

The informant advised that he is certain that he observed this object on the above date, as he had taken the day off from work to observe the predicted passage of Ranger VII over Berea, Ohio.

The informant described the object as being circular in shape and giving the appearance of being approximately the size of a basketball at arm's length. He stated the object was observed to be hovering and maneuvering in a westerly direction at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet, for a period of approximately 5 to 10 minutes.

The informant further advised that there were no wings or tail observed on the object, and that it made no sound. It was described as being silver or metallic in color.

As you know, the report is being submitted for such action as you deem necessary and no investigation is being conducted by this office.

Very truly yours,
Earl C. Brown 
SAC, CLEV
Special Agent in Charge
