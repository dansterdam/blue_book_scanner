The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram of several moving objects in the sky, described as "THREE BRIGHT OBJECTS MOVING AT AN ANGLE OF 45 DEGREES TO THE PLANE OF THE HORIZON" in the text. The objects are depicted as three curved lines or arcs, with an arrow indicating the direction of movement. The text also mentions that "ALL OF THEM WERE OF EQUAL SIZE AND REMAINED EQUIDISTANT ONE FROM THE OTHER. ONE 'TAIL' WAS LONGER THAN THE OTHER. SEEN OVER THE WEST HORIZON FROM THE WEATHER STATION AT POCATELLO, IDAHO."

August 3, 1959
USAF, Pocatello

Dear Sirs:

I had no prior knowledge there were any reports of UFO's when I submitted piece of paper. There were no other phenomena observed at the time. I had asked the Tower Operator if he had seen what I had seen and his response was negative but he offered that there had been numerous report of phenomena. This was the first I had any knowledge of any previously reported sightings. They did not appear to be on a collision course with the earth. There was no explosion when they passed beneath the horizon. The time was August 1, 1959.

Respectfully yours,
(C.H.de J. Pinon?)
MAJOR, USAF RETIRED.
