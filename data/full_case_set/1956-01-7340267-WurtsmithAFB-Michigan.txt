Occupation: Aircraft Landing Control Technician

Organization: 2030th AACS

Age: 22 years

Education: High School Graduate
Qualifications: Tech School - 20 weeks (Control Tower and GCA)

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE HAS BEEN EMPLOYED IN GCA AND CONTROL TOWER FIELD FOR 2 1/2 YEARS. HIS EMPHASIS IN STATING THAT OBJECT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AIRCRAFT, BALLOONS, OR ASTRONOMICAL BODIES INDICATES RELIABILITY.

III. OBSERVER'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: I WAS ON STANDBY DUTY IN GCA. AT ABOUT 1850 HRS, 5 DEC 55, I OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT COLORED (YELLOWISHORANGE) OBJECT IN THE SKY. IT WAS STATIONARY AND APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 10 TO 15 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON TO THE SOUTHWEST. AS I WATCHED, THE OBJECT BEGAN A RAPID UPWARD CLIMB OF ABOUT 10 TO 15 DEGREES, AND CONTINUED CLIMBING RAPIDLY TO A POINT APPROXIMATELY 40 TO 45 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. IT THEN STOPPED AND MAINTAINED THIS POSITION UNTIL IT BEGAN A GRADUAL DESCENT AND FINALLY DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. DURING THE ENTIRE OBSERVATION, THE OBJECT REMAINED STATIONARY EXCEPT FOR THE CLIMBING AND DESCENDING MANEUVERS. IT DID NOT BLINK OR CHANGE IN INTENSITY OF LIGHT. I COULD NOT DISCERN ANY DEFINITE SHAPE OR OUTLINE. IT APPEARED TO BE A BRIGHT LIGHT ONLY. AS IT CLIMBED IT APPEARED TO INCREASE IN SIZE ALTHOUGH IT REMAINED A POINT SOURCE OF LIGHT. THE TOTAL OBSERVATION LASTED ABOUT 5 MINUTES.

AF FORM 112—PART II
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FLT 3-6, 46024 ATIS9
I. SOURCE: WILLIAM H. FREELAND, 2/Lt., USAF
Occupation: Radar Observer (F-89 Aircraft)
Organization: 445th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron
Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Oscoda, Michigan
Age: 21 years
Education: 2 Years College
Qualifications: Radar Observer Training

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE is quite sure of himself in his ability to observe. He stated that USDC was only called in by SPINTRAN and planned to transfer the radar contact to the Air Force. SOURCE is married.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF RADAR CONTACT: *Upon returning from a patrol mission, the pilot, who is also a qualified radar observer, stated that approximately 200 degrees, 10 miles, the radar picked up a target closing in at a high rate of speed. The pilot tried to obtain a positive identification and came within 1/2 mile of the target, which was maintaining an altitude of 17,000 feet. The pilot stated that the target was much larger than the average jet aircraft and appeared to be traveling at an estimated speed of 600-700 knots. The target was observed and locked on by radar for approximately 2 minutes and 45 seconds before it faded from the scope. Two further passes were made in an attempt to reacquire the target, but it could not be picked up again. The pilot stated that he had in his experience never seen anything like this target before, either in size, speed, or maneuverability. When the pilot attempted to close on the target, it appeared to accelerate suddenly and pull away from his aircraft. The pilot said that it moved eratically at times, making sharp turns and sudden accelerations. The target was observed to be solid, not blinking lights or unusual phenomena. The pilot stated that he could not maintain contact with the target, which seemed to disappear rather than fly out of range. When the target faded from the radar scope, the pilot returned to the field and landed at approximately 1715 EST (1005Z).

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE didn't seem to be certain of himself. Tried to make his statements coincide with those of his officer.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTINGS: "On the evening of 11 January 1956, at the approach of night, an object of the approximate size of a medium bomber was sighted east of the field at about 6,000 feet. It appeared to be spherical in shape, silently moving across the sky at a rapid rate in a northeasterly direction. The object seemed to glow slightly and at intervals it would suddenly increase in speed and disappear. It was called Paredell to see if they had an aircraft in the air, but Paredell said they did not have any planes up. I then had the object in sight -- he said what they had seen looked different from anything that was up. The object moved rapidly and when it would suddenly increase speed it would disappear from sight. It was in sight for about 10 minutes. The position was approximately 10 miles east of Oscoda, Michigan over Lake Huron, moving in a northeasterly direction."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO: 30-UFOB-1-56
PART FOUR
PAGES 9 OF 6

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
1. A check with the Wurtsmith Weather Station revealed no significant meteorological data related to the UFOB sighting.
2. Lt Finasse contacted the 725th ACAW Squadron at Fort Austin, Michigan who investigated the possibility of other aircraft being in the Oscoda area during the UFOB sighting. No aircraft were known to be in the area.
3. Contact was later made with Dr. Everett R. Clark, Professor of Physics, Wayne University, Detroit, Michigan. Dr. Clark stated that the UFOB was observed to be of a higher magnitude than the 20-30 degree elevation planets in the southern sky during the UFOB sighting. He also stated that the position of Venus and Saturn, also observed, were as expected for that date and time.
4. The pilot of the F-89 aircraft, 1/Lt Culpepper, could not be contacted due to his participation in a cross-country flight. Sgt. Culpepper was on pass and could not be reached either.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
1. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer that although the UFOB was located in the same area of sky as the VENUS on the night of the observation, it appears unlikely that the UFOB was VENUS because of the following reasons:
a. Sgt. Porter observed the UFOB to a nearby star (which could have been VENUS) and stated that the UFOB was not as bright as the star.
b. Sgt. Porter also stated the color as being reddish-orange; the known color of VENUS is white and yellow.
c. Sgt. Porter also reported that the UFOB made radar contact with a nearby F-89 aircraft, which would indicate a metallic object rather than a star or planet.
d. The UFOB made a steep angle climb which was observed both visually and on radar, while the F-89 aircraft was flying straight and level at 7000 feet.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
AIR 11. 2 concur with the findings of the Preparing Officer. The nature and physical characteristics of the UFOB, as observed and reported, indicate an object unnatural to known types of aircraft or other conventional celestial phenomena. The above report indicates a phenomenon at variance with ordinary flight characteristics and of a nature previously reported and is therefore consistent with the general type of observations reported for this situation.

2. A meteorological analysis of the atmospheric conditions viewed from the ground through this temperature inversion would appear to be distorted and could appear to move, bounce, and/or change color due to the optical reflection due to meteorological conditions.

3. As a result of the statements of the SOURCES, the location of the VENUS and the length of the UFOB observation, it is the opinion of the APPROVING OFFICER that this UFOB is not explained by this evidence or phenomenon of meteorological origin.
