Memo (AFCIN-4E), 19 Apr 61, Request for Review

TO: AFCIN-4E (Maj Friend)

1. The report dated 14 Apr 61 from Anderson AFB has insufficient information upon which to base an evaluation for possible action. The description of the target is not given.
2. Report dated 17 Feb 61 has been evaluated and indicates that considering speed of target, a sentry body (or canopus) is about the only possibility. The anomalous propagation or equipment malfunction are other possibilities, however.
3. Evaluation of report from 344th ACW Sq., Vung Tapi, Viet., dated 28 Feb 61, indicates some USAF activities for possible chuff exercise could be made.
