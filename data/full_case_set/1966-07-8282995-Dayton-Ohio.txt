U.F.O Office 
Wright-Patterson AFB Ohio
Gentlemen:

Yesterday, the radio news mentioned that some reports of sighting a blue-green light travelling south to north. I missed hearing where a witness was. It was also reported that a bright object was seen over the area last night. It was low to the horizon and seemed to increase in size as it moved rapidly across the sky. It was observed for several minutes before it disappeared.

I would like to confirm what the official report was concerning this incident, if it is known to your office. Any information you can provide would be most appreciated. 

Yours truly,
[Name Redacted]

The page includes a form with various fields filled out, providing details about a UFO sighting that occurred on 6 July 66 in Dayton, Ohio. The observer noted seeing a very brilliant metallic silver object that made no sound and kept moving at a steady speed until it disappeared below the horizon. The object looked like two lines glued together with the edges filed down to give them a sharp edge. The sighting took place near sunset, and a high-flying aircraft would have been visible if it was illuminating the object. The sunset was at about 1955 on 6 July 66.

ATIC (DESTRT) person APB, OHIO 54433
1 August 1966

Marysville, Pennsylvania 17053

Dear [Redacted],

Our office has received numerous calls concerning the observance of a suspected unidentified flying object that was over the Dayton Area on the nights of 18 and 19 July 1966.

We were able to contact Mr. [Redacted] on the nights of 18 and 19 July. He states that he and his wife observed a bright light at approximately 11:00 p.m. on the bottom of the plane. He states it was flying a zig-zag pattern and the light would dim and then brighten. The light was at a high altitude and appeared to be stationary at times. After observing this for about 15 minutes, the light departed to the south.

I feel sure this was what you reported. There was no unusual objects reported to provide any additional information.

I wish to thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
VICTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

19 Jul 66

Conversation with Mr. Lot - 744 (19 Jul 66) of Barnes Aerial Advertising, Winchester, Kentucky was flying the night of 19 July in the Dayton area. Mr. Lot was flying a 1959 Champion Aircraft with an advertising sign that had a series of lights on the bottom of the plane. We plane landed at Montgomery County Airport to refuel before circling the Dayton area. Aircraft was advertising for Borchers Ford's 1966 close out. Lights on the bottom of the plane are series of lights from other side of the craft in the distance, the advertising appears only as a row of blinking lights. Area representative will call us about this and the surrounding area.

Mr. Lot contacted WF SAFCON on each flight in this area. He has been flying around the Cincinnati Area since April, refusing to do the Greater Cincinnati Airport.

Mr. Lot said that a person would have to be directly underneath the plane in order to read the sign. Mr. Lot is going to send the Project Office a picture of his plane.

Mr. Lot informed the project office that he would be flying over the Dayton area on the evening of 19 Jul 66, 2030 - 2230 hours.

Conversations of 19 July 1966 regarding observations on the night of 18 Jul 66

Check with WHIO. The man who answered the switchboard said that he didn't have anything in his script about the UFOs last being a neon sign for a car dealer flying over Dayton. He said to listen to the 8 o'clock news.

Check with the Clinton County AFP, Ohio Weather Bureau - Negative.

Check with the Police Department - specifically Lt. Hado. He observed what he assumed to be a sign being towed by a commercial plane. The object appeared to be going East to West, thought it was probably over Springboro. Lasted to be at about 1000 ft, probably around 8 and 9 pm. If we want further information check with the Records people, Sgt. Hanby. They hadn't given any further thought to the observation because it definitely appeared as a/c with banner in tow.
He had been down to watch the Cincinnati Reds play ball the other week when Frisch's had a similar banner flying over the ball park for approximately one hour.

Spoke with WHIO newsroom. They had gotten their information from the newspaper and therefore didn't know who the car dealer was.

Contacted Montgomery County Airport 366-2487 Radio Room
There is flying different advertising and he is from Winchester, Kentucky. She is going to have this man call us when he comes in for she didn't know if he was flying last night or not.

A citizen from the Dayton area called on 19 Jul 66. What he observed last night sounded like a piper cub hovering lights, lights would go West to East. Plane was flying SE towards Cincinnati and Virginia. He had called WHO radio station and they told him not to worry about it. He said he and his two friends thought it sounded like a piper cub.

NEGATIVE REPORTS FROM:
Stanger's Ford Co Vandalia Airport Perfley Ford Co FAA, W-F AFB
Tower at W-F AFB Clinton County AFB

Call from Marysville, Pa 17053 who is visiting in the Dayton area. He saw an object traveling SE to NW. He never say anything like it and he certainly knows what an aircraft looks like. This didn't have caution lights. Lights seemed to revolve slowly. It would go slow and then fast, disappeared near the Fairglair tower. It was like twenty lights surrounding. They would be on and then off. Called the base last night, 19 Jul 66 at 257-0122 and the guy who answered said he was looking for them but couldn't see them. Which thought the guy should be able to see them but really wasn't looking.
Lt. Marley explained that certain portions of W-F are at quite a distance from Dayton and they might not be able to observe it. Sent a Form 14h on 19 Jul at his request.

Text extracted from the document:

THAT "SAUCER" YOU SAW WAS ONLY AN AD
An airplane trailing an advertisement for a local auto dealer was mistaken by some people as a "saucer-shaped" flying object. Vernon Weber, 413 Forest Park drive, said he protested the advertising object at first, thinking it was a strange flying machine. However, when the airplane came closer, it was evident that it was merely towing an advertising sign.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains a series of questions about the observer's experience with a UFO sighting, including whether the object disappeared, moved behind something, or moved in front of something. The last question asks the observer to draw a picture showing the shape of the object and any details observed, such as wings, protrusions, and exhaust trails or vapor trails. The filename suggests this is page 119 from the document "1966-07-8282995-Dayton-Ohio.pdf".
