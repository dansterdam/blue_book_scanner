Gentlemen: As I have stated, I am not sure about the dates of these sightings as I believe the date is correct on the sighting discussed in this question. About 7:15 pm as I was returning to my home at 2218 Kintyre, as I drove into the drive, I looked up and there were three (3) objects or approximately 20 degrees about the horizon. The objects were traveling at a very fast speed in a northern formation. The two objects at the front were disc shaped and the third object was cigar shaped. The two front objects were absolutely white in color. My first impression and accent to my eyes, they made a humming sound. There appeared to be a blinking light or lights on this formation as it passed by. If these objects were any sound at all, they were approximately 200 feet altitude as I ran across the street to a neighbor's home. Both of my neighbors will not see their permission reveal what they saw as they watched these objects disappear in the northern direction. This sighting lasted approximately 45 seconds to a minute. I am quite sure this aircraft was not any aircraft which I have ever seen. This sight was a brilliantly lit object, and the objects which I saw as cigar shaped, were whirling and seemed to waver as they passed out of sight. About a week previous to this sighting, I saw what I believe to be a similar object near my place of business at Center Church. this object was located, in the northeast sky to the east of us, and seemed to change color from red to white to blue, and at times seemed to almost disappear. It was traveling pretty fast as far as Granada, Mississippi. It seemed to be quite some distance off, and I was informed by the deputy sheriff, there was no known aircraft known to be in the area at that time. It was a very bright, fluorescent color. It appeared to leave a small contrail.

About the middle of March of this year, 1966, I watched the most unusually thing - an object flying in the sky.
I was at my father's home, which is about three miles outside the city. His house is on a hill, and the view of the sky is practically unlimited.
It was about 7:05 P.M. It was outside traveling the sky. I noticed it in the Far East, traveling quite fast. It had the appearance of a bug - not a big object at all. It passed over my father's house. The object was in the shape of a V or picture frame. The center of the object was a bright, red light. Neither of these lights were flashing - they were on only a few seconds. I looked at it there was no visible wiring on it. The body itself appeared transparent. I knew there was an airplane from the time I first saw this object until it disappeared in the distant sky approximately five minutes.
I trust the above and enclosed information will be of help to the Air Force and a firm believer in God Almighty and Jesus Christ. So I'm a Catholic but I also firmly believe that these objects are intelligently controlled, though they may be extraterrestrial controlled.
If I can be of any further help, please do not hesitate to call upon me.

Transcription of the text in the document:

I want to advise you of an unusual incident encountered last night in this area. This incident appears to cover a possible explanation of sightings of unidentified flying objects in this general area.

On the night of 10 October 1966, at approximately 8:00 PM, this writer received a phone call from one of our employees, stating that they had observed a strange object in the sky, apparently falling, and that it appeared to be on fire. Upon further questioning, this employee stated that it seemed to be dropping slowly and that it appeared to be on fire or glowing.

This writer immediately went to the area and was able to observe the object in question. I am able to state that it did appear to be a small object, approximately 2 feet in diameter, which was falling slowly and appeared to be on fire or glowing. This object landed approximately 200 yards from where I was standing, and upon reaching the area I was unable to locate any evidence of its landing.

The object appeared to be under control and did not exhibit any of the normal characteristics associated with a meteorite or a re-entering satellite. There was no trail of smoke or debris, and the object seemed to be guided in its descent.

I would appreciate any information you may be able to provide concerning this incident, and if you desire, I will be happy to discuss it with you in more detail.

Description of the incoming light at approximately 8:00 p.m. on August 28, 1966. The light was first observed in the southwest by the observer and several others at the time. The light remained stationary for a few minutes, then suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed to the northeast, where it disappeared from view. The light appeared to be about the size of a basketball and was whitish-yellow in color. It did not appear to have any blinking or flashing lights. The observer stated that the light appeared to be much higher than an aircraft and was unlike any aircraft he had ever seen before. He indicated that the light's acceleration and disappearance were more rapid than any aircraft he had observed. The observer concluded that the light was an unidentified flying object.
