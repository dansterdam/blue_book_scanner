STATEMENT OF LIEUTENANT 8489
AT: MELVILLE AS, LABRADOR, CANADA
DATE: 6 AUGUST 1963

I was on duty as Officer of the Day in the Base Operations Office on the evening of 6 August 1963. At approximately 8:15 P.M. local time, I received a telephone call from a civilian resident of Melville AS housing reporting the sighting of an unidentified flying object. The caller stated that the object had been observed for several minutes and appeared to be a bright, illuminated object in the sky.

I immediately went outside and observed the object in question for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The object appeared to be a bright, illuminated shape against the dark night sky. It remained stationary for the duration of the observation. I contacted the Duty Controller and requested that ground radar attempt to detect the object, but no radar returns were obtained.

I completed and submitted a detailed report of the incident to the Command Post.

On August 6, 1963, at approximately 11:30 p.m., the witness observed a bright light over Baker Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada. The light was first spotted in the north and moved rapidly to the east, then stopped and hovered for a short time before moving to the south and disappearing. The witness described the light as bright and pulsating, and it appeared to be approximately the size of a small airplane at a distance. The observation lasted approximately 5 minutes.

8 AUGUST 1963
1. LOCATION: Melville, Labrador, Canada
2. DATE/TIME: August 6, 1963, 1350 hours 
3. WITNESS: Mr. Jack A. Ames, Canadian Government Meteorological Station, Melville, Labrador, Canada
4. DURATION OF OBSERVATION: 30 seconds
5. DESCRIPTION: Mr. Ames observed a bright white, oval-shaped object moving slowly in a westerly direction approximately 40 degrees above the horizon. The object appeared to be extremely high in altitude. It was observed to maneuver or change course during the sighting. No sound was heard. Weather conditions were clear.
6. CONCLUSIONS: The object was believed by Mr. Ames to be a high altitude, maneuvering aircraft or satellite. However, its high speed, lack of sound and apparent ability to change course suggest it may have been an unidentified flying object.
