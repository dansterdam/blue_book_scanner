PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 23/0005
2. SOURCE: 25/09/52
3. LOCATION: Indiana Area
10. CONCLUSION: Probable BALLOON

The image provided does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a form titled "SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE". The form includes various questions about the observer's experience with the unidentified phenomenon, including the date, time, location, and other details. The form also includes a sketch area where the observer is instructed to indicate the position and movement of the phenomenon.

Here is the text transcribed from the form:

THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENON THAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED. PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS. THE INFORMATION YOU GIVE MAY BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR SCIENTIFIC STUDY. RETURN THIS FORM TO THE NEAREST AIR FORCE BASE OR AFB OFFICE. WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO IS THE OFFICER IN CHARGE OF PROJECT "BLUE BOOK" WHICH INVESTIGATES UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA. THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

1. WHEN DID YOU SEE THE PHENOMENON? 
   DAY _25__  MONTH _5__ YEAR _1965_

2. WHAT TIME DID YOU FIRST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?
   HOUR _1:30_  MINUTES ___ A.M. _X_ P.M. ___

3. WHAT TIME DID YOU LAST SIGHT THE PHENOMENON?  
   HOUR __2:00_ MINUTES ___ A.M. _X_ P.M. ___

4. TIME ZONE: 
   [X] EASTERN [ ] CENTRAL [ ] MOUNTAIN [ ] PACIFIC [ ] OTHER _______________ 

5. WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW THE PHENOMENON? IF IN A CITY, GIVE THE NEAREST STREET AND INDICATE ON WHICH SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY YOU WERE ON OR NEAR AND TRY TO FIX A DISTANCE AND DIRECTION FROM SOME RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARK.
   TRAIN

6. IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE POINT SHOWN IN THE SKETCH. PLACE AN "X" ON THE CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH THE PHENOMENON WAS ABOVE THE HORIZON, OR SKYLINE WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE AN "O" ON THE SAME CURVED LINE TO SHOW HOW HIGH ABOVE THE HORIZON THE PHENOMENON WAS WHEN LAST SEEN.

The form includes a sketch area with an angle diagram, but no further details or descriptions are provided in the image.

The image appears to contain two illustrations. The larger illustration is a compass rose with directional labels. The smaller illustrations appear to be landscape drawings, potentially depicting the observation of a UFO-related phenomenon.

APR 50-17(C1)
NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A V ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

NOTICE:
THE SHAPES OF THE PHENOMENA OBSERVED SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO APPROXIMATE THE ACTUAL CONFIGURATION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. PLACE AN ARROW TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF MOTION, IF ANY. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR THE LARGER SIGHTINGS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO BE DISC-SHAPED, CONNECT THE APPROPRIATE PORTIONS OF THE CIRCLE TO APPROXIMATE THAT SHAPE. THIS WILL GIVE US A MUCH BETTER IDEA OF THE ACTUAL CONFIGURATION OF THE PHENOMENON.
