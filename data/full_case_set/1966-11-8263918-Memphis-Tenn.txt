Federal Aviation Agency
Attn: Mr. James F. Arthur

As the object was observed airborne at night, it had two white lights on the left and right sides, two red, fore and aft. The object appeared to be hovering above the ground and a pulsating sound was observed.

2. Request information on any helicopters or similar type of craft operating in the Memphis area on 3 Nov 66. If the Naval Air Station to the northeast of Memphis had a detachment or helicopters airborne at known, any information which you can provide will be appreciated.

THE PREPARING OFFICER HAS NO FIRM BASIS FOR DETERMINING THE POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THIS SIGHTING. THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT RECEIVED IN WHICH THE DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT IS SOMEWHAT COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THE SO-CALLED "FLYING SAUCERS." THE DEPARTURE OF THE OBJECT FIRST TO THE WEST AND LATER TO SOUTHWEST SUGGESTS A HELICOPTER SINCE THESE DEPARTURES ARE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MEMPHIS METROPOLITAN AIRPORT. HOWEVER, AN EXAMINATION OF A MAP OF THE MEMPHIS AREA DOES NOT SHOW ANY REASON WHY A HELICOPTER SUCH AS MIGHT BE USED IN PASSENGER SHUTTLE SERVICE WOULD BE FLYING NEAR THE POINT OF SIGHTING AT SUCH A LATE HOUR. OBSERVER DISPLAYED A REASONABLE SPEAKING ACQUAINTANCE

WITH MODERN AIRCRAFT TYPES BY DESCRIBING THE MOVEMENT OF THE OBJECT 
AS BEING LIKE A PHANTOM II DURING A MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE TAKE OFF- 
THIS SUGGESTS A HIGH RATE OF CLIMB AND GREAT SPEED FOR THE OBJECT- 
BUT OBSERVER STATED THAT OBJECT MOVED AWAY AT A CONSTANT ALTITUDE.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE OBSERVER WOULD HAVE READILY RECOGNIZED A 
HELICOPTER AS SUCH BY ITS NOISE, SILHOUETTE OR MANEUVERS. THE 
PARTICULAR SOUND ATTRIBUTED TO THE OBJECT AND THE MYSTERY OF THE 
RADIO NOISE REMAIN UNACCOUNTED FOR AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT. 
THE MEMPHIS FLYING SERVICE ALSO IS LOCATED NEAR THE POINT OF SIGHTING BUT INFORMATION ON THE TYPES OF AIRCRAFT IN USE OR SCHEDULES 
IF ANY, ARE NOT AVAILABLE. THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND THE AVAILABLE 
INFORMATION DOES NOT LEAVE A CLEAR VIEW OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
THE CAUSE OF THIS SIGHTING. PARA WLS NONE.

It appears to be a typed letter on Federal Aviation Agency letterhead, addressed to Colonel Louis DeCoes, Director of Technology and Subsystems Headquarters, Air Force Systems Division (AFSD), Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433. The letter is dated December 5, 1966 and is signed by James F. Arthur, Chief, Memphis Tower.

The text of the letter is as follows:

FEDERAL AVIATION AGENCY
Airport Traffic Control Tower
P.O. Box 20050
Memphis, Tennessee

December 5, 1966

Colonel Louis DeCoes
Director of Technology and Subsystems
Headquarters Air Force Systems Division (AFSD)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

Dear Colonel DeCoes:

This is in reply to your request of November 21, 1966, for aircraft information concerning helicopters on a flight over Memphis on November 3, 1966.

A search of all available records and information in progress at that time does not reveal any indications that could have been operating VFR and not under the control of the Memphis Tower. Inquiries made of the Memphis Naval Air Station also revealed that they had no record of any helicopter operations at that time.

Sincerely yours,
James F. Arthur
Chief, Memphis Tower
