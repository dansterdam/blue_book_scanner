WHALEY, ENGLAND
25 APR 62

ENGLAND:
The "Whalley UFO" was sighted on Sunday, 25th March. 1962, at about 5.45 p.m. In the Whalley district, near Blackburn. A young housewife, Mrs. J. E. Lane, was cleaning her kitchen windows when she noticed a strange object in the sky. It appeared dark in color, about the size of a football, and was hovering in a northerly direction. Mrs. Lane watched the object for about 20 minutes, and she says she saw it shoot off at tremendous speed, disappearing completely in about 10 seconds.
Mrs. Lane's claim is substantiated by her husband, who came to the window to look at the object. He confirms his wife's observations. Several other persons are reported to have seen this "UFO" on the same day in the Whalley area.
We are thinking of making a thorough investigation of this case, as it appears to be one of the most convincing sightings to occur in this country for some time. The object was seen at close range and moved at a very high speed. We shall do our best to authenticate this case further.
