Report of Analysis
APPENDIX "A"
15 August 1962
1. Attached is a copy of the ADD report of analysis of the object sighted on 7 August 1962 at Skyline Drive, Washington, as supplied to the ADD from Maine Field, Washington, because it was considered the USAFS conclusion that this object could not be part of the Project Blue Book investigation.
2. The ADD report concludes that this object could not be part of the Project Blue Book and that the conclusion is supported by the evidence.

I. PURPOSE
To identify the sample and its origin.

II. TECHNICAL DATA
1. The sample was assigned Physics Laboratory serial number 10023.
2. The sample was photographed to show its dimensions.
3. The sample was examined:
   a. For radioactivity using a scintillation counter. No radioactivity.
   b. By emission spectrochemical methods. The composition of the three different phases were identified. The spectrochemical analysis provided these data: Estimated concentrations in weight percent:
   (1) Silica 20%  (7) Calcium 1%
   (2) Aluminum 10%  (8) Potassium 0.1%
   (3) Sodium 4%  (9) Manganese 0.1% 
   (4) Iron 2%  (10) Chromium 0.01%
   (5) Magnesium 2%
   (6) Titanium 1%
4. X-Ray Spectrochemical Methods.
Analyses were performed on samples identical for sample taken from the core and from the outside layers. The major constituent in both cases was crystalline SiO2.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

Infrared Spectroscopic Methods:
1. The infrared spectrograms did not show the presence of any organic material. It did describe the presence of carbonate.
2. A chemical test for carbonates was negative.
3. A sample was heated slowly to 1100Â°C with no apparent change in weight or dimensions. This was some indication that it was from white to brownish material.

III. CONCLUSIONS:
1. The chemical composition of the sample is that of a bentonite clay. The material was consistent with sodium, potassium and calcium ions.
2. The object could be formed by a sudden application of heat, as a lightning bolt or as an air-to-air collision. The material has been exposed to heating, or in water dissolved and recrystallized to the present state.
3. The composition and nature of the object shows beyond doubt that it could not be part of a space vehicle or other space equipment.
