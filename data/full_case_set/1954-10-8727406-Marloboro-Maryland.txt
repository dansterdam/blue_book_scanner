Transcription of the text in the document:

SUBJECT

SPECIFIC INFORMATION: BLUE BOOK CASE 5357
LOCATION OF INCIDENT: MARLBORO, MARYLAND
DATE-TIME GROUP OF INCIDENT: 8 OCTOBER 1954
DESCRIPTION: AT APPROXIMATELY 2150 HOURS ON 8 OCTOBER 1954, WHILE OBSERVING THE SKIES OVER MARLBORO, MARYLAND, WITNESSES REPORTED OBSERVING FOUR OBJECTS IN THE SKY THAT WERE FLYING IN A CLOSE FORMATION. THE OBJECTS WERE DESCRIBED AS ROUND OR DISK-SHAPED AND WERE REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN HOVERING OR MOVING ERRATICALLY IN THE SKY. THE OBJECTS WERE ILLUMINATED WITH A REDDISH OR ORANGE-COLORED GLOW AND WERE ESTIMATED TO BE BETWEEN 30 AND 45 FEET IN DIAMETER.
EVALUATION: THERE APPEARS TO BE NO REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR THE OBJECTS OBSERVED. ALL WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE HIGHLY MANEUVERABLE AND MOVED ERRATICALLY IN A MANNER THAT COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED BY ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT. THE OBJECTS WERE UNDER OBSERVATION FOR APPROXIMATELY 12-15 MINUTES AND WERE SIGHTED BY SEVERAL RELIABLE WITNESSES.
CONCLUSIONS: THESE OBJECTS REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED. SUCH SIGHTINGS IN THIS AREA WERE COMMON DURING THIS TIMEFRAME AND A NUMBER OF BALLOON AND OTHER CONVENTIONAL OBJECTS WERE ALSO REPORTED IN THE VICINITY. HOWEVER, THE BEHAVIOR AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECTS OBSERVED IN THIS CASE APPEAR TO BE BEYOND THE CAPABILITIES OF KNOWN AIRCRAFT OR OTHER CONVENTIONAL OBJECTS. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED.
