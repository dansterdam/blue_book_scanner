Here is the text from the document:

PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD

1. DATE: 11 October 1957
2. LOCATION: San Diego, California
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 0232/30002 
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Visual
5. PHOTOS: None
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Unknown
7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
8. COURSE: Unknown

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
Light, alternating from blue-white to orange-red. Object was stationary then moving fast.

11. CONCLUSIONS: 
a. Was probably balloon
b. Meteor or meteor-like object
c. Astronomical - probably planet
d. Further analysis of photographic data changing position of objects over time may provide additional information of atmospheric optics. Sighting was of rather short duration and normal astronomical or meteor phenomena cannot be excluded.

See Fall Constellations

Some characteristic fall constellations are visible in the northern sky during this month. A usual solar eclipse is visible only from Antarctica.

BY JAMES STOKEY

At present Venus is the brightest object in the evening sky except for the moon. It is very bright and can be seen about halfway between the horizon and the zenith for nearly two and a quarter hours after sunset.

...

The constellations of the Zodiac:
Just below the center we find Pisces, the water-fishes, Cepheus, the king, Aries, the ram, and Andromeda, the chained lady. Diagonally opposite is Pegasus, the winged horse, which is one of the highest in the sky along with the still higher Cassiopeia, the queen, to the right from Markab form the so-called Square of Pegasus.

...

Symbols for stars in order of brightness:
• = brightest, • = next brightest,

The Army Corps of Engineers, although
not primarily concerned with the UFO pro-
blem, has participated in a special study of
the subject at the request of the Air Force.
Edgar R. Henry, Director, Army Develop-
ment and Proof Services, Aberdeen Proving

casional sightings reported to them, and
that they have furnished certain data on re-
quest from the Air Force.

Among the scientific activities in this field
is the plan of the Army Medical Service to
publish two volumes in the near future on
"Aviation Medicine and Space Medicine".
Progress in related fields is also reported.
Professor Graner, and C. Garner, of the Ar-
my Ordnance Research and Development

have been working on the mechanism of
propelling solid particles at high velocities.
They report progress in this field that is clas-
sified secret. Other classified work relating
to the interests of the Air Force is also being
carried on at this center.
The Army may have developed other tech-
niques which could be of importance in the
UFO problem, but if so, information on them
would be classified.

the earth's atmosphere, barely touching it abovethe Auroral zones. These Auroral effects are caused byparticles emitted from the sun. Their intensities andfrequencies at various places on the earth's surface willvary with the solar cycle, and the best times for observing them scientifically should all be studied.One important phase of the ICY program isconnected with the ionosphere. The higher layersof the ionosphere will be studied in detail, and it isaffected by the sun's radiation. When the moon cutsthis radiation off, important observations can be made.During these periods the upper layers of theatmosphere will be able to see another selfless onceor twice every few years. This will be one of the newphases that will be studied.About 10 days after new moon, the brightAurororal arch begins to form, reaching peak intensityon the evening of Oct 15. The star Epsilon Persei, in thebeginning is a little to the left of Mirfak, a little to the left.Continuing on with the magnitudes, 5.0,5.4, 5.2, and 4.6 are the next brightest stars.Below Epsilon Persei is the star called gamma Persei, ofmagnitude 3.0, and about two hours later Albir is about twiceas bright as Epsilon Persei.At about 9:45 p.m. on the evening of Oct 15you will find that the bright center of brightness whichis now only a small part of the whole Aurororal arch willslow.ly at first.

NO CASE (Information Only)
8 October 1957
AIR FORCE BOSTON

PILOTS SPOT A PSEUDO-SPUTNIK

Notes: A large percentage of the early "sightings" of the Russian satellite Sputnik were undoubtedly accidental sightings of the new high-flying jets probably accounted for most of the mistakes, but some reports, appearing to be highly circumstantial, were undoubtedly caused by seeing luminous objects in the sky, which bore some resemblance to the new higher-flying jets.

October 8, 1957 - Veteran Pan-American pilot Joseph E. Flynn, arriving in a DC-7G from Boston, reported that a newly arrived passenger arriving with him at first believed was the first Sputnik. The plane passed over Boston at 7:40 p.m. about 6 minutes after the launching of Sputnik. The passenger, an electronics engineer, was able to identify clearly to the pilot that the object was not Sputnik. The object, described as brighter and larger than the aircraft, was at one time observed passing 20 degrees ahead of the plane, and at other times passing under it, moving to the horizon, and maintaining approximately the same elevation as long as it was in view. After this time, the pilot lost sight of the object.  

The object was in view for about five minutes as it moved to a point almost directly ahead of the plane, then climbing and passing behind the aircraft. The passenger assumed it was either an aircraft reflecting the sunset, or possibly a satellite or meteor. Since it was last seen remaining in view, and the duration rules out a meteor, and the size and brightness rules out an aircraft, it may have been a satellite which passed close by.  The long duration rules out the possibility that it was simply the Sputnik. Astronomers have estimated the time of the passage of the satellite as 27 minutes. Since the object was observed for 5 minutes, it was nowhere near New England at 7:55 p.m. Both the pilot and the passenger were convinced that the object was not Sputnik.

The observation was mentioned in all N.Y.C. afternoon papers for October 8. Additional details were obtained from Mr. Box by a CAA member, and researcher Herman H. Mitchell; although Mr. Box declined to be more specific on the details, we are obliged to him for permitting us to use the information.

"OCTOBER 8, 1957

"Ball Of Fire" - Or Something - Over Dayton

Area-wide reports full of mystery came in from south of Dayton, O., late yesterday as a brilliant light was sighted over the city. At first it seemed as though it might have been a crash of some sort, but there was no explosion and no sounds were heard.

An Air Force spokesman said the "big, brilliant light" was observed in Dayton and a few other Ohio communities by a number of residents. He said the Air Force was unable to give any explanation for the light other than to explain that the Vandalia weather station had reported "unusual weather conditions" which could have something to do with its appearance.

Leonard H. Stringfield, director of civilian defense here, said the Air Force had told him a few days ago that "they have been alerted to watch for unusual sightings." Stringfield said the Air Force had advised Ohio civilian defense directors that "they will need help from the public in reporting such sightings."

Stringfield, who rushed out to see the light, said he was standing near Vandalia when he saw something which "might have been a crashed or crashing plane, but which seemed too high." The light, he said, seemed to be directly over Vandalia near the West Third bridge.

The Oakwood, O., police station reported a brilliant light in the sky a little after 7 p.m. The light was described as round and white, very bright, and slightly smaller than the full moon.

Mrs. Ralph Anthony, who lives near West Carrollton, said she saw a strange object in the sky which seemed to her to "have wings and tail like a plane, but larger and much brighter than any aircraft I've ever seen."

"It was traveling at tremendous speed," she said. "I first thought it might be a jet, but it seemed to be going in an odd direction, not like a jet plane at all."

S. 23 p.m. - Wilbur Kauffman, a Trotwood, O., resident, told reporters he observed a bright object streaking through the sky above the horizon at about 8:23 p.m. "It appeared to be a large metallic or glassy object," he said, "and as it passed overhead it gave off a bluish-green flash of light."

"The light was visible for about 3 or 4 seconds and then it disappeared from sight," he added. "I was amazed at the speed of the object and the way it maneuvered."

Kauffman said the object appeared to be traveling in a northwest direction."

The image contains a photograph of a "SPACE CATERPILLAR" that was observed on October 13, 1957, shortly after midnight on a clear Sunday morning. The document describes the sighting, noting that the "caterpillar" was shrinking and stretching, contracting and expanding, and its color constantly fluctuated between white, blue, and green. The observer, Mrs. Sophie Rashkoff, commented that the object went dark and disappeared at times. The document suggests that this sighting is an authentic observation.

SPACE "CATERPILLAR" LAYS EGG

October 13, 1957: Shortly after midnight on this clear Sunday morning, Mrs. Sophie Rashkoff, residing in Long Island City, New York, about 225 above the horizon, observed a very large white light in the west-northwest, about 20 degrees above the horizon. It was certainly no ordinary star, for the object was constantly changing in length about 2 to 3 degrees. This "caterpillar" was shrinking and stretching, contracting and expanding, and the color was constantly fluctuating between white, blue, and green. At one time, the object was yellow rays emanating from the left-hand end of the object. As one time, the object seemed to divide into a head and a tail, and this division moved along the length of the object. At times the object went dark as it swelled and disappeared. Altogether the object was under observation for about 15 minutes.

Mrs. Rashkoff, the mother of CSI member Benjamin Rashkoff, was in bed asleep. Her son was apparently awakened by the light and called his mother to observe it. In his initial observation, he comments that he saw a "twinkling star." But it seems inconceivable that the object he observed for some time (15 minutes) could actually have been a "twinkling star." His description, as given by his mother, is certainly an authentic one, and the observation is apparently an authentic one. The changing colors and the shrinking and stretching characteristics are difficult to explain in terms of any ordinary phenomena.

Subj: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
Ref: (a) OPNAV INST 3820.6 of 10 NOV 55

1. The following information was obtained from a PINING, AGC/C-station, Eleventh Naval District, with instructions as forth in reference (a) for information and any further action as may be desired.

2. On the evening of 17 October 1957, PINING was on duty in the Air control center. At approximately 1750, the duty controller (USMC) observed on his radar scope an unidentified object entering the radar pattern from the northwest at an approximate altitude of 35,000 feet. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed, estimated to be approximately 3,000 knots. As the object approached the San Diego area, it accelerated and then suddenly disappeared on the radar scope. The object was observed on the radar scope for approximately 30 seconds. 

3. PINING stated that the object suddenly reappeared on the radar scope approximately 30 miles east of San Diego, California, and appeared to be gaining altitude. The object then disappeared from the radar screen. The controller on duty attempted to scramble aircraft to intercept the object, but was unable to do so, as there was insufficient time before the object disappeared.

4. EWING was on duty on the evening of 17 October 1957. EWING learned that the (U) had been detected on radar and had been in contact with the object and had learned that the 92nd was alerted radar contact with the object, and had launched aircraft to attempt an interception, but the object had disappeared from radar before the aircraft could reach the area of the sighting.

5. A full report in accordance with the instructions contained in reference (a) is being prepared and will be forwarded as soon as it is completed.

2. To supplement the report, the following statement by the pilot that sighted the object is forwarded:

"At about 1900 PST, I sighted what appeared to be a 'halo' about 30-40 feet in diameter at an altitude of approximately 2000-3000 feet, altitude above the ground being between 1000-1500 feet, over San Diego, California. The object was observed for a period of approximately 10-15 minutes. The object appeared to be hovering in one position and had a luminous quality with a greenish hue. The object disappeared from view while being observed, and I lost visual contact with it. I was piloting an F4D-I aircraft at the time of the sighting."

COOLEY, William L, LT USN, 347-10-54, A/C USN, Pilot operator.

1. After cast-off, I sighted an object which appeared to have a greenish hue and the size and general characteristics as above-described. This object remained stationary for about 10-15 minutes, and then disappeared from view as we flew out of the area.

"I turned west and assumed a heading of 230 mps, with the light continuing to gain altitude. As the object continued to climb, it changed from a white light to a brilliant white. It seemed to assume an oval shape and gave the appearance of glowing intensely. The craft operated at an extremely high rate of speed, from an estimated 600 knots to 1000 knots IAS and still observed no range rate.

"From Point Loma, on out the object climbed steadily and it collected in a degree of 52,000 feet. The object then leveled off at 45,000 feet and stabilized. After following for 10 miles and stabilizing, the object then made a very tight turn closed to 10 miles and stabilized. After following for 5 miles, the object then increased in speed to 180 knots IAS and still observed no range rate.

"The object continued to maneuver, but in no more than 10 seconds - and then closed to within 7.5 seconds of the initial sighting. The object then reversed course at 6000 feet and about 40 miles from Point Loma, the object then climbed rapidly and out of sight.

"Although the operator switches to manual and searched continuously, no further observations were made.

"Visual contact was maintained for a distance of 30 miles from sight before lost.
PSTORM: Point Loma operators contacted and advised the report. They stated they had picked up the object on their radar and could track it without difficulty from time of initial sighting. They advised the object leveled off at 45,000 feet and that was the highest altitude shown on their equipment.

"After landing I spoke by phone with the tower operator. His comments are better made in a separate statement, but he agreed the object he saw and that reported by me were something other than a conventional aircraft. He saw the object at the same time I observed it."
