INVESTIGATOR'S SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT (INITIAL)

INCIDENTS OF I5 JULY 1953 
23 JULY 1953
FOREST CITY, ARKANSAS 

IAD CASE NO.-B331 
AIRFORCE NO. 3-0028

BASE PERSONNEL OBSERVED 

The observers were some of the military personnel stationed at this communication facility in Forest City, Arkansas. The times of observations were about 12:00 noon and 2130 on 15 July 1953.

AT ABOUT 12:00 NOON ON 15 JULY 1953 THE OBSERVER, WHOSE NAME IS OMITTED HERE, OBSERVED SOME STRANGE AERIAL OBJECTS IN THE SKY OVER THE FIELD ADJACENT TO THE FACILITY. HE STATES THAT HE NOTICED SEVERAL OBJECTS MANEUVERING AT HIGH SPEEDS AND MAKING VERY SHARP TURNS. HIS OBSERVATION LASTED ABOUT 5 MINUTES. THIS OBSERVER REPORTS THAT NO SOUND WAS HEARD FROM THE OBJECTS.

AT ABOUT 2130 ON 15 JULY 1953 ANOTHER OBSERVER, WHOSE NAME IS ALSO OMITTED HERE, OBSERVED TWO STRANGE AERIAL OBJECTS OVER THE SAME FIELD AREA. HE STATES THAT THESE OBJECTS WERE VERY BRIGHT AND APPEARED TO BE HOVERING IN THE SKY. AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES OF OBSERVATION, THE OBJECTS BEGAN MOVING AWAY TO THE EAST AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED, AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.

WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND THE WIND WAS VERY LOW DURING BOTH OBSERVATION PERIODS.

COMMENTS: IT IS THE CONSIDERED OPINION OF THIS INVESTIGATOR THAT THE OBJECTS OBSERVED IN THIS INCIDENT COULD POSSIBLY BE IDENTIFIED AS SOME TYPE OF KNOWN AERIAL VEHICLE. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LACK OF DEFINITE INFORMATION REGARDING THEIR IDENTITY AND CAPABILITIES, OFFICIAL IDENTIFICATION CANNOT BE MADE AT THIS TIME.

THE FINDINGS OF THIS REPORT IS TO BE USED BY THE AIR FORCE IN CONTINUING THE "FLYING SAUCER" INVESTIGATION.

SIGNATURE ____[signed]___________________________  CODE:
DATE _____July 18, 1953___________________________

On the day of July 10, 1953, an object drew my attention shortly after sunrise. It appeared to be at an altitude of about 8 miles. The object was rounded in shape and was of a metallic or glazed finish. It did not appear to have any means of propulsion. The object remained stationary for about 3 or 4 minutes and then started moving in a southeasterly direction at a very high rate of speed, disappearing in about 30 seconds. The weather conditions were clear at the time, and I was unable to hear any sound from the object. It was a very impressive sight, and I wish I could have had a better look at what it might have been.

18 - Very probably a meteor. Sending questionnaires. Ask your confirmation.
13 - Sending two questionnaires. Ask detailed information on this sighting and ground observation conditions to gain this sounds like a meteor.
11 - Possibility here of upper air research balloons although our people on Many Dick balloons show none in vicinity for this date.

WAR activity starting from Carolina area, however. Sending questionnaires to various Observers involved. This is to WADC (COLS) for local balloon release. Carrying this as unresolved.

Dear Dr. Rynski:

It has been sometime since we have received any comments on the sightings and are anxious to get your opinion on same. When do you expect to have the pertinent information which you indicated would be forthcoming and when can we expect it? I would appreciate it if you would advise me on this, and also on the status of the Washington Conference this week on Press Release and now if a regulation for this Project and so tie up my project as I suppose to be personal.

Capt. Russell is due back today and we anxious to see him, and as I think I have told you, he will be participating with my replacement project until my replacement arrives.

Best regards,

Bob Olsson

The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a scanned document from the Ohio State University, specifically from the Emerson McMillin Observatory. The text in the document appears to be a letter dated July 27, 1953, addressed to "Dear Capt. Ruppelt and Lt. Clasen" discussing observations and information related to the Project Blue Book UFO investigation.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
EMERSON MCMILLIN OBSERVATORY
COLUMBUS 10
27 July 1953

Dear Capt. Ruppelt and Lt. Clasen:
Greetings, Captains, and glad to have you aboard again. (Pardon the Navy expression.) Here are my comments on the last few items that were sent to me on 18 July. Of these three items, one concerns a sighting in Arkansas on 11 July. The question we should like to have you answer on this one is whether or not a little can be added about its width. The other two items deal with our previous forms "G" and "D" which you should know about already, and we have this additional information.

The shape on the film on one has been a disputed one, and certainly an unusual one if it went into the overcast. Fireballs have been known to break out of the overcast, but it would be unusual for one to come through the overcast. So perhaps the direction of motion, the rate of motion, and such matters as the apparent diameter should be followed up. Again, the information we would like is on our Form D.

We shall be in New Mexico on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (28,29,30) and will take the cameras along to Holloman Air Force Base for the calibrating tests on the 29th, as you told us. I shall be on the watchout for phenomena over their range as I shall of course do on any legitimate occasion when I have a chance to observe something down. I shall of course do the same legitimate observations at other locations before I leave.

Cordially,

Allen Hynek
