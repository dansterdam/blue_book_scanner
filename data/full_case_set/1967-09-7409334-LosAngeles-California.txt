The text of the document is as follows:

MEMO ROUTING SLIP
TO: SMLS/Captain Flynn
REMARKS:
Reference your letter of 13 November on SAMSQ Random Reentry Safety Policy. Attached are two items I thought you might be interested in concerning an "object" that dropped into a yard in Hawthorne.
The news query from the LA Herald Examiner resulted in a short story in that paper. Apparently the "thing" was part of a meteorite or something similar and not part of a spacecraft or craft entering the atmosphere.
Major Dupuy's action was to check the object and then forward it to the Foreign Technology Division at Wright Patterson AFB. If desired, submission of information of this type will be made in the future to SMLS.

OFFICE OF INFORMATION QUERY
FROM: Hanis Allison
APPLICATION: LA Herald Examiner
PHONE: RE 61212

What are the details and the description of the meteorite to which fell in Hawthorne today?

EXPLANATION: Operations Division, 3l7th, Major Drury and his Sergeant

Could be thrust or a doubled fist and is blue in color with spots of white and the texture of a sponge, pitted and looks like lava as well. 

It is being held by the Operations Division of the 6592nd Support Group. It has Angeles Air Force Station on the Air Form, and an interesting in it. It not then it will be turned over to the appropriate people for their study and analysis.

The object will be forwarded to the Air Force's Foreign Technology Division at Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio for study and analysis.

Air Force to Study "The Things"
In short, the text on the page discusses a report of unusual objects or "things" observed in the sky near Hawthorne, California on September 21, 1967. The report states that the Air Force is investigating the incident and will study "the things" further.

TO: FDETR (Maj Quintanilla)

1. The enclosed objects were forwarded to this office by the Los Angeles Science Department for inspection and disposition since they were reported to have fallen from the sky. This station has no facilities to perform an analysis. Request your assistance in determining the content of objects.

2. One of the local papers gave this front page treatment and has thereby generated considerable interest. Any assistance you can render to provide a plausible explanation will be appreciated.

Maj Quintanilla:
Lt Matthews called regarding the attached. He wanted to know if this could be part of a satellite decay. I told him that I could not determine the source from the information provided. I also sent him a copy of the complete file in his request.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Reference Physical Specimen 26 September 1967
7 December 1967
Captain Margenthaler called and asked to have the following questions answered.
1. Could the sample be part of a rocket body or space vehicle?
2. Is there any indication of burning or charring on the outside?
3. Could the object be a meteorite?
8 December 1967
Called Mr. Huston (Head of Materials Lab)
His response to the questions were:
1. Sample (large) was not part of rocket body or space vehicle. It has much too high a silicon content. The slag has a high silicon content such as found in the sample.
2. The sample had been molten at one time. This again was expected of the slag.
3. It is also unlikely that the object is a meteorite, since it does not contain enough Ni.
11 December 1967
Called Lt. Marley (Metallurgist)
1. Lt. Marley did not think it was a meteorite either because meteorites are usually high in Fe, Mn, and contain some Ni.
11 December 1967
Called Dr. Hynek (Astrophysicist)

1. It is definitely not the common type of Fe-Ni meteorite. However, he would need to look at the sample before he made a definitely statement that it was not a meteorite.

Note: 1. Capt. Marganthelter wants the sample to be returned to AFB.
2. Hold the specimen for Dr. Hynek to see December 18-20.

ATTN OF: MAYA/C. D. HOUSTON/59036/132

SUBJECT: Analysis of Material from Los Angeles, California

TO: TDET/UFO (Lt. Marano)

1. The sample submitted by Mrs. Los Angeles, California was analyzed and the data obtained was included in report dated 12 October 1967.

2. The 3/8" disc of metal, which appeared to have been punched from a 1/4" sheet, was analyzed spectrographically and found to be unalloyed iron. The carbon content was found to be 0.21%, thereby classifying the material as a type 1020 steel, which is quite common.

3. Material corresponding to both samples can be found in the scrap pile of any steel mill.
