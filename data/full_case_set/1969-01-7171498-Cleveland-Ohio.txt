The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a filled-out Project 10073 Record form. The form includes details about a sighting of a "Probable HOT AIR BALLOON" on January 7, 1969 in Cleveland, Ohio. The observer sighted a yellow-white crescent shaped light for about 15-20 minutes, with the object disappearing after about 10-15 minutes.

The image contains a compass rose diagram and two smaller sketches or illustrations. The compass rose diagram appears to be used to indicate the position of a phenomenon, as described in the text below the diagram. The two smaller sketches appear to depict a road or street scene. There are no human faces visible in this image.

AFR 80-17(C1)
"AA. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON APPEARED. PLACE A UP ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE COMPASS IS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TOWARD WHICH THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO TRAVEL.
1. TO THE SYSTEM BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A UP AT THE POSITION WHICH IT APPEARED TO TAKE.
SUCH DIAGRAM CAN BE USEFUL IN SUPPLEMENTING A WRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF THE OBSERVED MOTION OF THE PHENOMENON. UNLESS THE MOTION APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER DIAGRAM."
