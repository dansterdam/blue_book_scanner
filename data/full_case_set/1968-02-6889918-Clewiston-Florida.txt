47. INFORMATION WHICH COULD BE ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE IS REQUIRED, BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

I believe it was not a gun, satellite, atmospheric disturbance, or anything else that would normally go to horizon to horizon, and I am sure that it was some kind of flying object at some time of flying
at a tremendous speed as I cannot pinpoint that I can determine what it was. If it was some kind of military aircraft, I cannot estimated speed or identification.

P.S. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to assist in this matter. The Air Force should give greater attention, publicity, and research to this UFO phenomenon that have taken place.

The image appears to contain a newspaper article with a photograph of two individuals. The article is titled "World's First UFO Murder" and discusses an incident involving Australian rancher Derek Hayden and his wife Mellisa, who were found dead in their ranch. The article mentions that their bodies were found in the kitchen of their ranch, and that there were no cats, birds, or other living creatures within a 1,000-yard circle around the house, all of which were dead. The article also states that a photograph of a UFO was taken in the vicinity of the ranch by photographers.

The text from the document is as follows:

"World's First UFO Murder

by AL KATZMAN
For Australian rancher Derek Hayden and his wife Mellisa, death came swiftly and with an eerie high-pitched whine out of the sky. "A flying saucer killed them," Territorial policeman Arthur White said flatly when interviewed last week by MIDNIGHT. "We have the evidence to prove it."
The bodies of Hayden, 35, and his 30-year-old wife were found in the kitchen of their ranch home near Borroloola in Australia's vast and lonely Northern Territory after neighbors reported "an enormous shimmering light" hovering in the vicinity. 
The light passed over at about 11:30," neighbor Frank McCullough, 50, told MIDNIGHT. "It was moving slowly so I got a good look at it."
His wife and six other people who work for the ranch say they saw the thing. It was no aircraft or helicopter or anything like that, McCullough said he and others watched the object for more than five minutes.
"But like they'd seen something so shocking and disgusting that they couldn't stand it, it's hard to describe their expressions but I hope I never see anyone with that look again.
"Whole bodies were what you might call 'arranged' they were placed together with the legs together and the arms extended out away from the side of the bodies.
"There were no cuts, bruises, or other marks on the victims - and no indications of a struggle in the room. A police dog belonging to the homestead was also found dead in the room. It was stretched straight out the same as Mr. and Mrs. Hayden. There were marks on the dog it's teeth were bared as though it were growing when it died."
Except for the gruesome discovery of the dead, the Hayden ranch house and the area around it extending for 10 miles in all directions was declared off-limits to neighbors, reporters and curiosity-seekers. Australian Army vehicles and government cars moved into the area and brought detectives and scientists to the scene. After four days of investigations, the bodies of Hayden and his wife were released for burial.

PHOTO OF UFO above was taken in vicinity of Hayden ranch by photographers some time day bodies were discovered. The photo was put on the story."

Transcription of the text in the document:

Unidentified UFO Sighting
Marimonnet) The name of the cameraman was probably invented.

Carol and Jim Donegan of the Garland (Illinois) Research of (Palo Alto, California) were apparently doing some diving on the Caloosahatchee River. They took some very good pictures of this UFO sighting.

They said the object was hovering for a fairly long period, probably 3 to 5 minutes, and then accelerated straight up and out of sight at a very high rate of speed. There was no sound and no visible means of propulsion. The object was disc-shaped and very metallic in appearance.

I have made several inquiries of the US Government agencies dealing with UFO's and have not been able to find any factual information on this sighting. I would appreciate your checking your files and see if you have any information. More detailed and accurate information on this sighting would be most helpful.

CAPTAIN MARIETTA CORPORATION 
March 4, 1968

United Air Lines
Stapleton Field
Denver, Colorado

Dear Captain ****,

As I have met here at the Martin Marietta Corpora-
tion in Baltimore, has asked me to write you regarding a UFO sighting by me on the night of February 3, 1968.

It was flying a Lockheed Jetstar at 35,000 feet and indicating Mach 0.82. 
The weather was the best with unlimited ceiling and visibility. A bright light 
was first observed at my 11 o'clock position. This light appeared to be about 
fifteen or twenty thousand feet higher. At first, the light appeared to resemble 
a small of two car light. The light was blinking on and off at random time in-
tervals. The light would seem to go out completely and then reappear. The blinking 
was about 3o§.

At about 12 o'clock, they definitely appeared as two distinct light 
sources. Each light source emitted that I would describe as a pencil beam 
cr illumination, white in color, and had a very dense and brilliant appearance 
to phosphorescent. The changes in color were subtle and did not appear mediated.

When these lights moved to a lower altitude, the rear light seemed to be out-
distancing the rear light. The rear light at this angle appeared as two distinct 
lights of the same intensity and brilliance as before. This observation was made 
at a distance estimated to be about ten miles from my position.

The time was approximately 10:55 p.m. EST. My course was a Doppler track
from PVT direct to INO. Drift was six degrees right. The total time this was 
observed was between 15 and 20 seconds. All this observation is as it was actually 
witnessed and my opinion concurs with everything as it is stated here.

The shape of the object was, from my estimation, round, and of a silvery metallic color. It appeared to be hovering or stationary in the sky.
From the front it appeared to have a bright light, as if a headlight was on the front. The size of the object appeared to be about 15-20 feet in diameter.
The object did not make any sound that I could hear, and maintained its position in the sky for several minutes before slowly drifting away behind some trees, at which point I lost sight of it.
