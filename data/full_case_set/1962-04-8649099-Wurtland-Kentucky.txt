Text transcribed from the document:

Case # 10163-72 - NRXR 11 Apr 62 - 8649099 - Wurtland, Kentucky 
Sgt. C.J. Munz of 1152 Quartermaster Co. reported the following:
At approximately 2310 hrs on 8 Apr 62, he observed a circular shaped object, approximately 40-50 feet in diameter, hovering at an altitude of about 300 feet. The object was motionless and gave off a bright white light. After hovering for about 5 minutes, the light from the object suddenly went out. Sgt Munz then observed the object move rapidly in a horizontal direction at an estimated speed of 500-600 mph. The object then disappeared from sight. 
Sgt Munz had difficulty estimating the exact size and altitude of the object due to the lack of reference points in the area. He stated that the object appeared to be metallic in construction and that it was completely silent during the observation. Sgt Munz reported the incident to his commanding officer, who in turn notified the proper channels.
The case is being classified as UNIDENTIFIED.
