- page 1 -

The photograph shows an aerial view of a landscape scattered with numerous dark spots, which appear to be trees or other vegetation. The topography looks uneven with some areas having a higher density of dots than others. There are no distinguishable structures or specific features that can be identified with certainty due to the resolution and quality of the image.

Below the image, there is a series of letters and numbers that are possibly coordinates or a reference code:

"IR-25-V-3-8385 BTW 7284P-6"
"[CONF.]"

At the bottom of the page, there is another reference:

"INClOSURE A. OPI CASE 740-30"

- page 2 -

The image displays a black-and-white photograph that seems to capture an aerial view with variations in tone that suggest a combination of open, lighter areas and darker areas which may represent vegetation or shadows. The photograph has a grainy quality and no distinct features like buildings, roads, or objects can be identified. The photo is not clear enough to distinguish precise details that would provide context to what the area might be.

Here is the text from the document:

EXHIBIT E, OSI Case 7/1-30

- page 3 -

The image is a black and white photograph depicting a landscape, which appears to be an aerial view of a rural or natural area. It looks like there may be a mix of various topographical features, including areas of vegetation and possibly open fields, water bodies, or irregularly shaped clearings. There are also some circular patterns that may be indicative of craters or man-made structures. The quality is quite grainy, and specific details are difficult to discern.

The text on the document is as follows:

SR-2 / W-V-06858 14 SEPT 61 (CONFIDENTIAL)
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

The text on the bottom left of the page reads:
SECRET
6. C. OPI Case #4-30

There is also a faded, horizontal line of text that overlaps the photograph, but it is not clear enough to read accurately. The nature of the document and the classification suggesting confidentiality hint that it is related to some official investigation or observation, likely aligned with the historical context of Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. However, without precise context or clarity on the smeared text, further details cannot be provided.

- page 4 -

The photograph shows a grainy, black and white image of a landscape. The black parts could potentially be a body of water or a dark terrain feature, and the white parts appear to be a dense cluster of possibly reflective objects. There is a crosshair visible in the photograph, suggesting it might have been taken through a scope or aiming device. However, the image is not clear enough to definitively identify the objects or the exact nature of the landscape.
