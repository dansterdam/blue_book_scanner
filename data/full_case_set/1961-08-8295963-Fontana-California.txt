Analysis of Photographs (-------, Jr.)

SUBJECT (SAFCI-3E - Major Colonna)

1. The enclosed photographs have been examined by the FTD photo
analysts. The details necessary to identify the object shown were
developed.

2. Analysis - The object is analyzed, however, may have been
exposed during prior development or handling. The object shine, flutter, and is too diffuse could indicate it was not caused by a longer outdoor exposure. The indoor appears due to the fact that the light apparently came from the immediate vicinity.

3. It is the analysis opinion that the photographs are a deliberate hoax, caused by the procedure employed in their preparation.

1. This subject photograph has been examined but no conclusions could be reached as to the identity or nature of the object. However, it appears to be a small object, possibly a light or reflector, rather than an astronomical or celestial phenomena.

2. On one of the photographs the light source was almost in the exact center of the film frame, suggesting a direct overhead position relative to the object. The other photograph shows the light source in the upper right portion of the film frame, indicating some angle or lateral position compared to the object.

3. No further examination or analysis appears to be a productive effort. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that the object photographed is unidentified.

SUBJECT:  Analysis of Photographs

TO:  HQ USAF (SAFOI-3c - Major Coleman) 

1.  The attached photographs have been examined by the FTD photo analysis division in an attempt to identify the objects pictured. 

2.  The analysis concluded, however, that the objects were small, being superimposed on the negative possibly indicative of indoor exposures due to the fact that the light apparently came from a single source.  

3.  It is the analyst's opinion that the photographs are a deliberate hoax, and not a representation of any actual phenomena.
