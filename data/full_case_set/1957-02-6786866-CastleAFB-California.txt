CAUSES OF SUCH RADAR RETURNS, BUT ALL EVIDENTLY ARE YET UN
PROVED. ONE OF THE RADAR OBSERVERS HAD EXPERIENCED THE SAME 
TYPE RETURNS WHILE WORKING AT A CAR SOUTHERN AE BASE.
FAMOUS 14/1361/KC-97F WAS CONTACTED IMMEDIATELY IN THE LOCAL
AREA. THE ONLY PERSON ABOARD OBSERVING ANY THING OUT OF THE
ORDINARY WAS THE RADIO OPERATOR,A A/2C MUCCILLO, WHO, FROM THE
RIGHT SCANNERS POSITION SAW WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE SHOOTING
STARS. A/2C MUCCILLO REPORTED SEEING APPROXIMATELY 5-10 OF
THESE OBJECTS, BUT SAW NOTHING UNUSUAL THAT WOULD IDENTIFY THEM
FROM OTHER "SHOOTING STARS" HE HAD OBSERVED THAT NIGHT AND 
ON OTHER FLIGHTS.

COARSE OF THE SIGHTINGS ON THE SCOPE DOES NOT CORRESPOND
SATISFACTORILY WITH THE OBSERVATION FROM FAMOUS ARM GCI WAS
NOTIFIED, BUT COULD NOT PICK-UP THE "TARGET" ON ITS RADAR SET.
ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENON COULD POSSIBLY EXPLAIN THE RADAR RETURNS
SEEN AND THE CONSIDERABLE SPEED WITH WHICH THEY WERE OBSERVED
(APPROXIMATELY 5,622 MPH.).

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO.				SUBJECT
				Request for Analysis - UFO Electronics Report
TO				FROM				DATE
AFOIN-4b21			AFOIN-4b21			4 MAR 57
ATTN: Mr. Bryant		ATTN: Capt G.T. Gregory/wm			COMMENT NO. 1
  In accordance with established policies for the analysis of UFO reports, the attached teletype message from Castle AFB, California, is forwarded for your review and conclusions.
                 /s/ R.V. REECE
                  AFOIN-4b1
                  SUBJECT SPECIALIST
TO: AFOIN-4b1			FROM: AFOIN-4b1			DATE: 22 MAr 57
ATTN: Mr. Bryant/skb/te13

  The contents of the attached teletype have been carefully reviewed by this office. From the information that is available it is highly unlikely that anything they are asking for an analysis on would be of any particular scientific or technical merit. The attached data will probably add little or nothing to our current knowledge concerning UFO's, and as you know, we have processed literally thousands of similar types of reports previously. It is recommended that no further action be taken on the material forwarded herewith, and that this entire request be filed for record purposes only.

                 /s/ GORDON C. HOFFMAN
                 COLONEL, USAF
                 AFOIN-4b1
