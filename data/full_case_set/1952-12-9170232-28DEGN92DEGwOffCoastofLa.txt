Here is the text OCR'd from the document:

COAST GUARD SHIP COMMANDER AND PILOT OF 10 DECEMBER 1952, PILOTED BY CAPTAIN JOHN HARTERJEVAS 150 MILES OFF COAST OF LA. COAST GUARD CUTTER "SEBAGO" CALLED RADAR OFFICER LIEUTENANT 
CASSIDAY. COLLINS AND CAPTAIN HARTERWATCHED MAIN RADARSCOPE TO SEE IF UNKNOWN OBJECT WOULD JUMP.
IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT IN INDIGO FORK, HARTERWPRE CALLED THE RADAR OFFICER LIEUTENANT CASSIDAY, WHO CAME TO THE RADAR SCREEN. LIEUTENANT CASSIDAY SAID THAT'S THE DARNEDEST THING I EVER SAW.
AT THIS EXACT MOMENT THE UNKNOWN OBJECT HAD GONE 10 MILES. IT JUMPED.
FOR AN INSTANT IT SEEMED THEY WOULD MEET HEAD-ON, THEN COLEMAN SAW THE OBJECT STREAKING TOWARD
THE S.20 0 NW. IT SEEMED THEY WOULD MEET HEAD-ON, THEN COLEMAN SAW THE OBJECT STREAKING TOWARD S-20 NW.
COLEMAN SAID,JJELP ME TRACK THIS THING." THE STAFF SERGEANT SWIFTLY COMPUTED THE
IT WAS 5,243 MILES AN HOUR.
CAPTAIN HARTERWATCHED IN AMAZEMENT, THEN COLEMAN GRABBED HIS INTERCOM MIKE AND TOLD
CAPTAIN HARTFR, "YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS - IT WAS MAKING 
CLOSE OVER 10,000 FEET." (WHEN COLEMAN HURRIEDLY WENT TO WORK, MASTER SERGEANT BAILEY BENT OVER THE SCOPE TO WATCH, AND A SECOND LATER LIEUTENANT CASSIDAY, THE NAVIGATOR, CUT IN ON THE INTERCOM, SAYING, "DID YOU SEE THAT? IT'S GOING LIKE AAARRGH RACING ACROSS HIS SCREEN ABRUPTLY. HARTERJOCRISPVOICE CAME THROUGH THE INTERCOM
"THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A PASS AT US." WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
CASSIDAY SAID, "COLEMAN, YOU TELL ME, IT'S BREAKING ALL THE RULES. NO STREAKS, OR BLIPS CROSS HIS SCREEN. STRAIGHT AND REALS SHARP. ONE APPROACHED ON THE RIGHT, HE CALLED OUT, "HAS THAT SOMETHING STREAKED OUT THERE?"
COLEMAN SAW A BLUR,IT SEEMED TO FLASH BY, THEN HE SAW A BLUISH-WHITE PROJECTHADING FROM FRONT TO REAR LIKE A COMET. IT HAD HARDLY DISAPPEARED WHEN ANOTHER GROUP OF ALIENS CAME. 
THEOUGH THEIR COURSE WAS EVEN FASTER. LONGER ENOUGH TO VERIFY THE BOMBEK LIKE SHAPES, THEY WERE GONE IN A FLASH. ALTHOUGH THEIR COURSE WAS STUDIED, NOTHING COULD BE DETERMINED EXCEPT THEY WERE IN FRONT 10 HIS SCOPE AT EACH 20 SECONDS.
AFTER THE CRISIS LIGHTING, THERE WAS A SUDDEN LULL. THE CREW AND SKIPPER WERE AMAZED. THREE MINUTES PASSED, THE MEN WERE SLOWLY RETURNING TO RELAX WHEN THREE MORE OBJECTS APPEARED ON THE SCREEN.

THESE OBJECTS WERE ROCKETING BACK AND FORTH ON THE SCREEN.ON THE NEXT FOUR O'CLOCKS HE BAWLED INTO THE MIKE," OPEN-MOUTHED, HE WATCHED THEM DART AND FLASH, OUT-MANEUVERING ANYTHING HE HAD EVER SEEN. MASTER SERGEANT BAILEY'S FACE
WAS BLUE, A GHASTLY TINT, STRANGE TINTS OF BLUE-WHITE LIGHT APPEARED TO PLAY OVER THE FORMS.
THE OBJECTS SWERVED,HEADING STRAIGHT FOR THE S. 20 O CENTER. HART ER FROZE 
AT THE CONTROLS. AN INCREDIBLE THING HAPPENED BEFORE HIS EYES - THEY VANISHED.
THESE CAME IN - FEW SECONDS - SLOWED DOWN AND PRACTICALLY STOPPED. THE SKIPPER
AT THAT MOMENT WAS WATCHING, AWESTRUCK, AS THE UNKNOWN OBJECTS PULLED OFF TO ONE SIDE.
THERE WAS A SUDDEN STILLNESS, THE OBJECTS MOVING AT OVER 9,000 MILES AN HOUR. THE SMALL OBJECTS 
MERGED WITH THE LARGER. THE PILOT GASPED, "DID YOU SEE THAT?" OUR CUTTER WAS A TOY. WE CLOCKED IT, SAID COLEMAN. "YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS - IT WAS MAKING OVER 10,000 FEET."

STAFF SERGEANT PERRIS BEAT BAILEY TO THE WAIST BLISTER. OPEN-MOUTHED, HE SAID "THE INSTRUMENTS THAT CONTROL THIS LIGHT -SHOOTING SHIP COST OVER $70,000...SIXTY MILES IN THE COCKPIT. EARHOLES EVER WERE GLUED TO THE AUXILIARY SCOPE" FORTY 61.  MILES SUDDENLY THE OBJECTS SWEVE, HEADING STRAIGHT FOR THE D-29 HARTER, BUT BEFORE ONE COULD MOVE THE CONTROLS, AN INCREDIBLE THING HAPPENED. 64. OBVIOUSLY CRUSHED UNDERNEATH THE OBJECT WERE HUNDREDS FOR SECONDS. THEN - SWIFTLY PICKING UP SPEED, THE UNKNOWN OBJECTS PULLED OFF TO ONE SIDE. THE SAME - AMAZING- HARTER SUDDENLY SPLIT OUT OF SIGHT. HIS HALF-INCH SPOT SCALES ACROSS, STOPPED SLOWLY, HIS AFTER-IMAGE A CONFUSED BLUR ABOVE THE SCOPE. 69. THEN STILL MOVING, IT MERGED WITH THE OBJECTS" MASSIVE FORM ALL AROUND IT.71. FAST THAT HARTER SUDDENLY TURNED IT FLASHED ACROSS WILLIS' SCOPE AND WAS GONE. CAPTAIN: DID YOU SEE THAT?76. WE CLOCKED IT AT SAID COLEMAND - YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS - IT WAS MAKING OVER 8,000 MILES ALL HOUR!78. WHAT'S JUST WHAT I FIGURED. THE REST OF THE WAY HE KEPT THE CREW ON ALERT, BUT NO MORE UFO'S APPEARED. 81. CAPTAIN HARTER HAD RADIOED AHEAD, AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS WERE WAITING_. 84. NOTHING WOULD CHANGE THEIR STORY - AND STATEMENTS IN THE REPORT SHOWED THEIR FIRM CONVICTION. 85. A MAIN GROUP OF CLIPS WAS NOTED AFTER THE SET WAS CALIBRATED TO ARC DISTANCE FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN SECONDS, A CONTACT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT RAN FOR ABOUT 20 SECONDS.89. LIEUTENANT COLEMAN SAID IT AS BEST'HE COULD, "WITH A STOP-WATCH OVER A KNOWN STAR RATE, I TIMED IT AT MACH 12 - BY DAMN IT WAS TRAVELING AT 12,240 M.P.H!" 95. THE ENTIRE CREW TO LOOK FOR THE OBJECTS VISUALLY AND FLASHES OF LIGHT WERE NOTED. THE OBJECTS COULD BE SEEN FOR MILES, BUT WHEN OBSERVED UP CLOSE, THEY DISAPPEARED AS SUDDENLY AS THEY HAD APPEARED. 97. 20 OBJECTS IN ALL ARE RECALIBRATED THE SET AND THESE SAME TYPES WERE NOT NOTED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE VERY LARGE ONE. LASERSIZED AS OVER 45 FEET IN DIAMETER, CAME UP TO WITHIN 4 TO MILES OF OUR TAIL, SOME UP TO WITHIN 40 MILES OF THE CRAFT, PASSING VERY CLOSE, DISPLAYING SMALL LIGHTS AND MOVED AT AN EXTREMELY HIGH SPEED AND WAS NOT A SOLID. FUNCTION OR OPTICAL. 98. COAST GUARD REPORTED A MASSIVE FORMATION CLOSER THAN THE FIRST ONE SEEN (THAT AT ONE TIME JUST SEEMED HUGE DURATIONS' - THE FAD OPERATOR REPORTED AIR SPEEDS OF THE OBJECT TO AVERAGE 5,240 M.P.H. 97. AT 0-C-LOCK-UPON LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW, I SAW A BLUE-WHITE STREAK TRAVEL PAST TO REACH. 98. STAFF SERGEANT GREAT PIECES OF WHATEVER IT WAS DISAPPEARED UNDER THE WINGS. I IMMEDIATELY LOOKED IN THAT POSITION AND SAW TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS APPEAR, DISAPPEAR, AND REAPPEAR.112.

Staff Sergeant Ferris base ball machine broke down, broke two machines streak, may have been due to a blue-white light passing through from NW to SE. Passing very close to instruments and auxiliary scope, Ferris miles away. Five of the sea search team found no radar targets where the blips occurred. The instructor's flight engineer received training and familiarization, which was checking the blips, duration, speed, and maneuver characteristics. The instructor and search pilot saw and tracked the blips.

Radar stated at that time he had 50-mile range on, indicating a return at 15-18 thousand feet elevation. With the blips continuing to a point 15-25 miles off the coast, and then disappearing, the instructor flight engineer tried running after them to observe positions, but as he got closer, they would just disappear. During this period, student and instructor radio viewed the scope, and determined no interference existed. At this time, Radar could not calibrate his set to eliminate any interference or malfunction, when he attempted to scan the scope once more, the blips had disappeared. It was called continuing from 7:40 to 9:15, when they disappeared, the speed stated between 600 to 9,000 mph. At all times the blips were witnessed, speed was in excess of our fastest fighter plane, and it passed in from the east, to the west, then to the south and off at the observer's sight.

"SAFOI-34" (A) 7291

24 March 1961

I saw the question of Dec. 3, 1952, what conclusion is* the Gulf of Mexico where three groups of UFO's were seen and radar-tracked by the crew of a Navy bomber and a USCI light aircraft on December 6, 1952. The object which was tracked by radar on 6 December 1952 is carried as unidentified in the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center files.

This page from the Project Blue Book report does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a weather data sheet that includes information such as date of observation, time of observation, station observing, wind direction and velocity, altitude, and velocity at various altitudes. The document also includes questions about whether an inversion layer was noted, any thunderstorms observed, cloud cover, and visibility. However, there is no photograph or image included on this particular page.
