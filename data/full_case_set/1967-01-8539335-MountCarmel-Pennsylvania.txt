CASE NO. 8539335
MOUNT CARMEL, PENNSYLVANIA
17 JANUARY 1967

1. On 17 January 1967 this office received a report of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting which occurred at Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania on 8 January 1967.

2. The witness, [name redacted], reported that at approximately 7:30 pm EST on 8 January 1967, he observed a bright light in the sky while driving home from work. He stated that the light appeared to be about 200-300 feet in the air and approximately 200-300 yards from his location. [name redacted] said the object was round in shape, about the size of a basketball, and had a bright white light emanating from it. He further stated that the object remained stationary for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

3. [name redacted] reported the sighting to the Pennsylvania State Police, who in turn notified this office. An investigation was conducted; however, no further information or evidence was obtained.

4. This case is being filed as unidentified due to the lack of physical evidence or additional witnesses to corroborate the reported sighting.

There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a handwritten document containing descriptive text.

I will now act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

I soon got enough of this and decided to treat [it?] as a test [??] My life was endangered, and I thought [?] I had already gotten what I wanted - information - so I sat.

I looked in vain on the ground for any tracks and I noticed that the earth had been stirred up a little nearby, apparently from where the object had come down. There was a little small mound of dirt in the middle of the disturbance in the soil.

I don't know how long I sat there, but after a while I decided to leave and get out of the area. I didn't want this thing to come back and land on me or anything like that. As I started to leave, I noticed a small lizard or salamander-like creature about 10 or 12 inches long crossing the dirt path in front of me. As I watched, it disappeared into some bushes nearby. I felt that this creature was somehow connected with the object that I had seen, but I can't say for sure.

As I left the area and started walking back home, I was very shaken up by the whole experience and I kept looking over my shoulder, afraid the object might come back. However, I saw nothing further. When I got home I immediately told my wife what had happened, and she was as shaken up about it as I was.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

The text in the document reads as follows:

The witness reported seeing a saucer-shaped object with a row of lights around the edge hovering over the Mount Carmel area for about 10 minutes on the night of the incident. He stated that the object appeared to rotate slowly on its vertical axis. The witness also reported seeing a similar object on a previous occasion about a year earlier in the same general area. He described the object as being about 40 to 50 feet in diameter and appearing silvery-white in color. The witness reported that the object climbed straight up and disappeared from view after the initial sighting. No other witnesses were reported.
