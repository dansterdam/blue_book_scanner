The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet (Summary Data) form with handwritten text. 

Transcribing the text from the document:

"Witnesses state that the object was about the size of a twenty-five cent piece held at arm's length and appeared to be a bright flat object - glowing green in the center with a reddish-orange outer edge or skin. The object flashed the colors a few times and then disappeared. Witnesses estimate that the object was at about 5000 feet altitude and moving in a straight line at a rapid speed. Weather conditions at the time were clear and the object was observed for approximately thirty seconds."
