Unidentified Flying Object Observer's Report
December 25, 1962

Gentlemen:

This sighting was made Tuesday morning, between 4:30 and 4:40, December 18, 1962. The sky was clear and the moon was shining bright. The object was about 46.50 above the horizon due East of Huntington, W.Va.

The star-or planet-I will refer to it as a star, was bright and steady. It commenced rapidly descending and followed a zig-zag course during the early morning hours about mid-way around the horizon between the Big Dipper and the rising point of the morning star. The star would disappear for a few seconds at a time, and then reappear a little closer to the horizon between 4 a.m. and 4:15 a.m., approaches its zenith about dawn and fades out well before the morning star. Fading the Morning Star as well as it had been visible shortly after raising about No. 3 or No. 4. 

The U.F.O. was visible to me as a point of light, faintly about No. 1 or No. 2 in size, brilliance diminishing as it moved away from the star to the east low point.

I first noticed the U.F.O. while looking at the star and wandered about a star of that size is that fast and then I watched closely again and see it move at a faster speed and that size that close and paid particular attention to that size that close and paid particular attention.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn diagram and written text describing an observation of a UFO.

The text in the document is as follows:

"to both bodies, the U.F.O. was motionless for a short time — not more than 5 minutes — then suddenly moved down and south toward the star El duce at a faster rate (KM? ) than the diagram shows.

Observation point 

Tread on a clock face you could say that the U.F.O. moved or appeared to go from the 12 o'clock position to the 7 o'clock position (or 5 to 12) in about 5 minutes. The light field of Star A, the distance traveled below the star was considerably less than the distance traveled above it. Suddenly it appeared in the mist and fog.

Weather conditions: Clear, cool, a half-moon, some haze."

Observation time: About 4:30 A.M. Motion-less for the first few minutes - not more than 5 minutes. In observation for a few minutes, object was observed stationary. Disappeared on the South and East of the flight line.

Observation point: An east window, top floor, main office building Huntington offices of the H.K.Porter Co. Inc. - North-East sector of Huntington, W.Va.

Note the U.F.O. was too far away to see either tail, superstructure or vapor trail. It was visible only as a point of light which so much resembled a star I first thought it to be one.

Sincerely,
Huntington 1, W.Va.
