AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: FLYOBJECT
DATA: On 13 January 1953, between 1548 hours and 1300 hours, air defense radar sites at George Airforce Base, near Victorville, California, observed an unidentified flying object while on a routine training mission. The object was tracked on radar and visually observed by the duty controller, who estimated the speed of the object to be in excess of 1000 miles per hour. The object was observed to make sudden maneuvers and changes in altitude, reaching an estimated altitude of approximately 60,000 feet. The object was tracked over a period of approximately 45 minutes.

1. Description of Object:
Shape: Unknown due to high altitude.
Size: About the size of a pin-head held 2 feet from the eye.
Color: Silvery, possibly due to reflection of sun.
Speed: Great speed, estimated as 4 times the speed 
of sound.
Sounds: Similar to sound of a rifle shot, a high-pitched 
whistle, and like that of a rifle during rapid fire.
Maneuvers: The object made three (3) rapid turns as to
be seeking to confuse observers on its direction of 
travel. These turns were made at a smooth and continuous motion, in the manner described below.
(Observer) bore so to the right, followed a second's
pause, then bore so to the left, followed another
second's pause, then bore so straight ahead. This
placed the object back on its original course. This
type of maneuver is very unusual and not known to
be characteristic of normal aircraft.

The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a report document related to a UFO sighting in Sonoma, California on January 10, 1953.

The text output from the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED
Sonoma, California                                     10 January 1953

I. Description of Incident
At 2335, two civilian sources observed one small flying object moving at a great rate of speed and performing violent maneuvers. The object's round was similar to that of a jet aircraft, but smaller. It made a sudden change of direction first to the right, then to the left, and then dropped to the ground apparently dead, and disappeared.

II. Discussion of Incident
The only known aerial object capable of appearing to go through the described maneuvers would be a balloon; however, the time factors and velocity estimates do not support this conclusion.

III. Conclusion
Unknown
