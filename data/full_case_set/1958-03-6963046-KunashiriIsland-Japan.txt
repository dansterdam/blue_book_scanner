600 4th AISS, visited Noboru ITO, Chief of the Aviation Administration Section and Toru SAHARA, Chief of the No. 2 Security Section, MARITIME SAFETY BOARD (VSA) for information on an alleged explosion off the SIBERIAN coast on 19 February 1958.
2. Recently, three unknown luminous sightings were made off the coast of HOKKAIDO by fishermen and reported to MSA. MSA has recorded these incidents but will not investigate the matter further. In each instance the sightings happened at night. There is no report indicating an explosion off the coast of SIBERIA on 19 February 1958.
3. At 1330 hours (JST) on 31 October 1957 fishermen observed a pillar of flame 100 m high, 1500 m west of EMPETSU (4443N/14418E) for approximately 15 minutes. The color changed from red to blue then disappeared.
4. At 2034 hours (JST) on 1 March 1958 fishermen observed a luminous body disappeared after 10 minutes at an altitude of approximately 2,000 m in the direction of NOTSUTETO POINT (4444N/14525E) on KUNASHIRI ISLAND. The color was not determined. At 2103 hours (JST) on the same day, a luminous body was observed rising gradually for about 20 minutes then disappearing near KAPADYAYA (ONERUSU) (4345N/14526E). The color was not certainly identified, but was not red or green.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
At approximately 0959 hours (JST) on 19 February 1958, an unknown phenomena was believed to have occurred at a US radar site in JAPAN. The phenomena lasted approximately two hours. This office concurred with the information by Technical Advisory as being of intense interest in connection with possible seismic/volcanic phenomena associated with the Kunashiri and Paramushiru areas. As no barometric or seismic changes indicative of an explosion at the time were noted, the relative information was obtained from the Maritime and Air Staff Offices of the Defense Agency. Officials of the Intelligence Agency stated that any barometric change would be detected at weather stations in JAPAN. (A similar indication of a nuclear explosion was believed for seismic detection of USSR nuclear explosion.)
