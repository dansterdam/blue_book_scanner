Dear Mrs. 

Your letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been referred to the United States Air Force for reply. We are deeply sorry for the delay in answering your letter.

The time-all series you refer to are what. I propose from the available evidence they were probably experiments conducted by the Government and again they would not permit the aircraft to pass undetected. These radar returns which indicated a small object resembling an aircraft. These radar returns indicate that an unnatural phenomena took place in your vicinity. The radar returns were valid enough to mandate tracing the aircraft's flight and photograph, if possible, but we could not permit the aircraft to pass undetected.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM A. LOCKRIDGE
Lt. Colonel, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Division

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with text and a sketch or drawing of an unidentified flying object (UFO) at the top of the page.

The text in the document is as follows:

"They are Believing that they are not alone in this world. The problem today is that they do not know who or what these craft are. They must try to learn more about them before they try to make contact with them. The craft one sees and one hears reports about are really more advanced than anything we have, so let us try to learn more about them before we try to make contact with them."
