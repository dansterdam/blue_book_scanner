2. LOCATION: 
Lowry AFB, Colorado
3. DATE/TIME GROUP: Oatc: 6-2-58 Time: 1430 Z
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual 
5. PHOTOS: Yes
6. SOURCE: Military
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 4-5 mintues
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
9. COURSE: At first appeared to be a falling leaf or small bird, then seemed to be a fast moving, white-silvery object descending rapidly in two parts or at least two separate appearances in succession. 
10. CRISP SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: As seen in two parts or at least two separate appearances in succession, the object appeared to be a small, rapidly descending white-silvery object, possibly tumbling or rotating. It appeared to be dividing or separating into two parts. The second part seemed to disappear or go out of sight at a considerable distance.
11. COMMENTS: This appears to be an unusual sighting reported by a reliable observer who is apparently an experienced observer of small aerial objects. The object was seen to appear and disappear in rapid succession in a manner suggesting some type of division or separation. The "1958 Gamma sighting" referred to may relate to this type of unusual phenomenon.

First Eclipse of 1958
April also brings the first eclipse of 1958, but it will not be visible in most of North America. This happens on April 19, when the new moon will come directly between the earth and sun. There will be a total eclipse of the sun, but only those in the Pacific Ocean southwest of South America and the southern tip of Africa will be able to see it.

Transcript of text from the document:

LOWRY AFB, COLORADO, 6 APRIL 1958
On this date at 2255 a sighting of an unidentified flying object occurred. This object had a very brilliant light and was observed by five airmen, one of whom was a warrant officer. The object was first observed in the south-west at an elevation of 10 degrees. It was round in shape and about the size of a baseball held at arm's length. It appeared to be very high in altitude. The object remained stationary for about 15 to 20 seconds and then suddenly disappeared.
Immediately after the object disappeared, a second object appeared in the same area. This object hovered for a few seconds and then suddenly accelerated in a straight line to the north and disappeared from sight at a terrific rate of speed.
A check was made of the area but no other sightings were reported. The total time of the sighting was approximately 30 to 40 seconds.
Estimated speed: 7,000 mph
Estimated altitude: 30,000 ft. to 40,000 ft.
Estimated size: 6 to 8 inches in diameter 
(held at arm's length)
Elevation angle: 10 degrees

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the output of all the text found in the document:

"A brightly lighted object was observed at about 1155 1\larch 1958 by Sgt. Dexter A. Smith, while he was on duty at Lowry AFB, Colorado. The object was reported to be approximately the size of a basketball, round in shape and emitting a bright white light. The object was observed as it flew across the sky from east to west and then disappeared in the distance. The object was observed for approximately 15 seconds and was traveling at a very high rate of speed. Sgt. Smith reported that the object appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet and was absolutely silent in flight. Sgt. Smith had visual observation of the object for approximately 15 seconds before it disappeared from sight. He stated that he had never observed anything quite like it before. All personnel on duty in the control tower also observed the object at the same time. The information was immediately telephoned to the Operations Officer on duty and all pertinent information was relayed to the Project Blue Book Office of the Air Force at Dayton, Ohio. A complete report has been forwarded to this office. The weather at the time of the observation was clear, with light winds and good visibility. The object was described as round, like a basketball, and emitting a bright white light. It was observed traveling from east to west at a very high rate of speed and at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. All observers agreed that the object was absolutely silent in flight and unlike any aircraft with which they are familiar. The report was made in accordance with existing Air Force directives."

21 April 1958
Muskogee, Georgia

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

On the above date and time, this office was contacted by a civilian who reported observing an unidentified flying object. The individual stated that he had been driving on a rural road near Muskogee, Georgia, when he noticed a bright light in the sky. He stopped his vehicle and observed the object for several minutes. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was estimated to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. It hovered silently for a short period of time and then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.

The observer was unable to provide any additional details regarding the object, and no other witnesses were identified. A search of the area was conducted, but no evidence or additional information was obtained.

This report is provided for information purposes only. No further investigation is planned.

24 April 1958
End Ave., Michigan

FROM CLUTTER, SPACE AGENCY-CHURCH COUNTY'S ELECTRIC BLUE MAN OBJECT-COUNTRY'S SIGHTING-

NO PICTURES WERE TAKEN AS THE OBJECT WAS ALLEGEDLY ONLY IN SIGHT FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES. IT WAS FIRST SIGHTED COMING FROM LAKE SUPERIOR DIRECTION AND WAS MOVING AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED. IT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND WAS COLORED A BLUISH-GREEN LIGHT. IT HAD NO APPARENT WINDOWS OR PROJECTIONS OF ANY KIND. ABOUT THE SIZE OF A HOUSE TRAILER, IT WAS SEEN BY AT LEAST FOUR PERSONS WHO WERE DRIVING DOWN A COUNTY ROAD NEAR CLUTTER'S RESIDENCE.

THIS OBJECT LEFT NO TRACE OF LANDING OR TAKE-OFF AND DISAPPEARED OUT OF SIGHT IN THE DIRECTION IT WAS FIRST SEEN. IT MADE NO SOUND THAT COULD BE HEARD DURING THE SHORT TIME IT WAS VISIBLE.

DAVIS, A SCHOOL TEACHER WHO LIVES IN THE AREA, REPORTED SEEING THE SAME OR A SIMILAR OBJECT THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WHILE DRIVING HOME. HE STATED THAT AT THAT TIME, TOO, IT WAS IN SIGHT ONLY BRIEFLY. ACCORDING TO HIM, IT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL AUTOMOBILE, AND COLORED A BRIGHT BLUISH-WHITE LIGHT. IT MOVED AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND MADE NO SOUND. WHEN DAVIS TOLD SOME OF HIS NEIGHBORS, THEY REFUSED TO BELIEVE HIM, CLAIMING IT WAS ONLY HIS IMAGINATION.

THIS OFFICE CONTACTED THE COUNTY SHERIFF, WHO STATED THAT HIS DEPUTIES CHECKED THE AREA IMMEDIATELY AND FOUND NO TRACE OF ANY KIND OF LANDING OR TAKE-OFF. HE ALSO SAID THAT CLUTTER AND THE OTHERS WHO REPORTED SEEING THE OBJECT WERE SOBER AND TRUSTWORTHY INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD HAVE NO REASON TO REPORT SOMETHING THEY DID NOT ACTUALLY SEE. ALL AGREED THAT THE OBJECT CAUSED A BRIGHT ELECTRIC BLUE "GLOW" IN THE AIR AROUND IT WHICH COULD BE SEEN FOR SOME DISTANCE. THIS GLOW WAS THE ONLY ILLUMINATION IT DISPLAYED AND IT WAS NOT BEAMING OR FLASHING IN ANY WAY.

CAPT. GROUSE, WHO INTERVIEWED THE WITNESSES, STATED THAT THEY SEEMED GENUINELY DISTURBED BY WHAT THEY SAW AND NONE OF THEM TRIED TO EMBELLISH THEIR STORIES IN ANY WAY. HE SAID THEIR DESCRIPTIONS WERE CONSISTENT AND THAT THEY APPEARED SOBER AND INTELLIGENT. CLUTTER SAID HIS YOUNGEST SON, AGE 11, WAS WITH HIM AT THE TIME BUT WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT HE RAN INTO THE HOUSE AS SOON AS HE SAW THE OBJECT.

Bad Axe, Michigan 

HURON COUNTY'S ELECTRIC BLUE MAN

IT IS REPORTED AS HAVING GLOWED A BRILLIANT BLUE, BEING OBSERVED FROM COUNTRY ROADS AND BANKS, AND HAS BEEN SEEN ON AT LEAST TEN OCCASIONS. 

IT GLOWED IN A GLOWING BLUISH LIGHT ON 3 OR 4 COUNTRY ROADS AND BANKED IN FRONT OF HIS CAR.

IT IS REPORTED SEEING IT THREE TIMES NEAR ELKTON AND ONCE NEAR UNIONVILLE.

HE WAS THE ONLY ONE TO WITNESS THE PHENOMENON AT THESE TIMES. 

HIS PACE SUIT WAS MADE UP OF A REDDISH-BROWN OVER WHICH A BUBBLE PLASTIC SPACE SUIT

APPARENTLY HE WAS DANCING. HE TOLD HIS DAUGHTER TO GET OUT OF THE CAR BECAUSE IT WOULD BURN HIS DAUGHTER UP, BUT SHE DISCOUNTED IT. HIS ACTIVITY SEEMED FRANTIC.

IF THIS IS A TRUE CASE, IT SEEMS TO BE OF SOME INTEREST BECAUSE OF THE REPORTED GLOWING BLUISH LIGHT AND THE MAN'S REPORTED DANCE-LIKE MOVEMENTS. PERHAPS SOME NATURAL PHENOMENON AT WORK HERE?

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. As per the instructions, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

April 29, 1958, St. Paul, Minnesota
A UFO similar to the one reported in Tower, Minnesota, was observed by tower operators at Wold-Chamberlain Airport and by other observers. The CAA tower operator and a weather observer both reported it. It moved very fast and at a high speed on an easterly course. It was described as emitting sparks from its glowing mass before its sudden disappearance.
NICAP member H. T. Sherman, insurance underwriter and canvasser, who reported the sighting to the CAA tower operators at Wold-Chamberlain. The captain first observed Venus, which Sherman as an experienced observer knew was Venus. The captain then suggested a meteor or "falling star," stated Mr. Sherman. "A UFO's appearance was not even discussed." Finally, Captain Klassen suggested a small light on a plane, but Sherman pointed out these lights.
1. When the light was first observed, it was still fairly light, being about 7 p.m.
2. The light would have been seen by any aircraft, approach of which would have been officially recorded.
The Air Force captain, had no other explanation, and the sighting was officially recorded.

Text in the document:

April 29, 1958, St. Paul, Minnesota:
A UFO sighter by the name reported in a letter on April 27 was sighted by control tower operators at Wold-Chamberlain Airport and by others. The CAA said the UFO did not resemble a meteor or any other known object but that it was not to usual on high speed on an erratic flight without detriment.
It was described as emitting sparks from trailing stream before its disappearance. The UFO was seen by NICAP member H. T. Sherman, insurance underwriter and astronomer, who reported the sighting to Air Force Captain Kleeman at Wold-Chamberlain. The captain first suggested Venus, which Sherman said was visible, but the captain then suggested a meteor.
The story, reported by Mrs. Sherman, "A meteorite or UFO" suggested that out. Finally, Captain Kleeman suggested a gas phenomena and pointed out these items:
1. When the light went out no plane was visible in the sky which at 9 p.m. was still twilight.
2. No pilot in his right mind would approach a field with heavy traffic at such high speed and suddenly go out of sight. 
3. The Air Force captain had no other suggestion and the sighting was officially recorded.

Captain George T. Gregory

Dear Captain:

Some of you have had a chance to look through all the reports you receive and have noticed that I find some of the information to be very interesting. It is clear that the reports you send me are hand-written, and it takes considerable time to process them. I am wondering if a typewritten report would be more convenient and possibly result in a faster turn-around time.

From the reports, I have noted several incidents which appeared quite unusual, particularly one from an airman who claimed that a disc-shaped object was seen maneuvering over the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Although this report is not accompanied by any photographs, the details described in the report seem to indicate that the object was of a rather unusual nature. 

I had some instructions prepared for your daughters, but the bear on this envelope may have frightened them. I hope that they will not be too discouraged by my previous communication and will continue to send us their observational reports. I find the reports they send very interesting and they may serve as a basis for future scientific investigations.

If you could obtain permission from the authorities for me to visit your base at a convenient time, I would appreciate it very much. I would like to discuss some of the details of the reports with you and possibly observe some of the tracking procedures involved in your program.

Sincerely yours,

(Signature)

Transcription of the text in the document:

Greeted of morning daylight had already begun. We were in the valley as you described the terrain. Only the scattered clumps of gray-green sage brush gave any indication of a landscape. The sky was brilliantly clear—no clouds to interfere with the full impact of the bright sunlight.

The "case" of the "daylight sighting" is greatly ambiguous. While the details furnished are interesting, they do not, in my opinion, constitute a valid report of an actual observed object. However, they may be a result of some external influence, of which I am ignorant. How- ever, I cannot feel that the text of the report carries enough substance to warrant definite conclusions.

The only reaction in this particular instance is that of understanding. The phenomenon, whatever it may have been, caused some disturbance in the visual perception of the observer. But beyond this, I cannot feel that it calls for any unusual inference or conclusion. Rest assured that the whole matter will be given the fullest possible consideration. All personnel concerned with the investigation and study of such phenomena are fully aware of the need for extreme care and objectivity in the handling of these cases.

I am looking forward to visiting you in your new quarters. I hope in early June.

Cheers,

J. Allen Hynek
Consul

Jupiter Now Most Prominent
April is the month that will see the planet Jupiter in greatest elongation to the east, bringing the first solar eclipse of the year.

By JAMES STOKLEY

Jupiter is now in opposition to the earth, so that it is nearly on the same side of the sun as the earth. This means that Jupiter will rise about the time the sun sets, and will remain visible throughout the night. In fact, at about midnight, Jupiter will be seen highest in the sky.

Jupiter is now in the constellation of Cancer, but near that is the bright star Regulus, one of the "four corners" of the sidereal square of Leo. Also in that part of the sky is the constellation Gemini, the Twins. Near the bright star Pollux, one of the Twins, is the lesser dog, Canis Minor, the smaller dog.

Gion is Faint

To the right of Orion is Taurus, the bull, in which we can see the Pleiades, or Seven Sisters, a group of stars that have been observed since ancient times. This month a reddish variable star called Gion is very faint.

The last full moon, coming on April 1, was almost exactly overhead at midnight. The next full moon will be seen on April 30.

The Easter Moon

The Easter cycle is based on the moon. Easter always comes on the first Sunday after the full moon that occurs on or just after the vernal equinox, March 21. This year the full moon occurred on March 30. Thus, Easter comes on April 13.

The Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ took place during the full moon in Nisan, the first month of the Jewish calendar, which falls in March or April. Since Christ was crucified on a Friday, when the full moon would be in the sky, this made the story more dramatic.

One group wanted to celebrate Easter always on the 14th of Nisan, while another group wanted it on the Sunday following the 14th. This was settled at the Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D. by the Church, which decided that Easter would come on the Sunday following the full moon that occurs on or just after March 21.
