UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #225 – near Vaughn, New Mexico – latter part of 1947
3 or 4 November 1948
23 November 1948

it is difficult to ascertain vhothor the objects described
in this incident belong to the gonoral group of "Now Mexico green
flashes," or not. The description here is sufficiently different
from the majority to indicate that thoy do not: the characteris-
tic groen color is not mentioned.

It is improbable, however, that the three separate sightings,
all occurring at approximately 2200 hours and in the same locality,
can be explained as astronomical phenomena. Furthermore, the stated
altitude and distances are entirely out of keeping; this fact might
be discounted as an illusion, common in the observation of Fireballs,
if the instances were isolated. The weight of the evidence, however,
inclines to the conclusion that the objects were man-made devices
and part of some scientific experiments, so common in that section
of the country.

The following information has been received from the Fourth Army Intelligence 
Liaison Officer, Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico, dated 6 December 1948.

"Colonel E.M. , Executine, New Mexico Military District
reports as follows: 

"On 3 or 4 November 1948 at approximately 2130 hours, I observed a ball 
of light, reddish white in color, 1 foot in diameter, falling vertically. The 
ball burst 100-200 feet from the ground in a spray of reddish color with 
shower of sparks, which on touching the ground. This occurred abt 100 yards north 
of the main road which runs into Sandia from Albuquerque to a junction 
east of Vaughn, New Mexico, on Highway 60.

"On 25 November 1948 at approximately 2130 hours, I was driving west 
on Highway 60, about 10 miles west of Vaughn, New Mexico, I observed a ball 
of light, descending vertically, which burst 100-200 feet from the ground. 
The conditions and appearance were the same as occurred on 3 - 4 November. 

"Colonel stated that he did not report was the incidents as he thought 
they might have been connected with Sandia Proving Grounds. A further 
check disclosed that no sound or saw no aircraft during either incidents, 
which is understandable as he was traveling in a closed automobile, weather 
conditions were clear."

Incident: 225

Colonel █ first observed an unusual aerial phenomena during the
latter part of 1947. This occurred in the vicinity of Vaughn, N. M.,
when phenomena appeared approximately 400-500 ft above the ground.
The first one appeared was glowing, slowly and steadily in a vertical
manner toward the earth. It appeared slightly larger than a basketball,
bright white in color like a miniature sun. As a point approximately
200 feet above the surface of the earth, the object appeared to explode
although no noise was apparent. By this time the Colonel had stopped
his automobile and had gotten out to watch the object. No explosion
or disintegration appeared to be taking place some 30 to 60 yards
distant and still no noise was noticed. At this time the fragments
assumed a fiery red color and descended toward the ground in numerous
embers being extinguished before touching the earth. Life time was
Col █ was on Highway 60, near a railroad and separated from the
vicinity where the fragments were landing by a fence. He did not cross
the fence or investigate further.

On 3 or 4 Nov 48 at approximately 2130 hours he observed a ball of
light, reddish white in color, 1 foot in diameter, falling vertically.
The ball burst 10-20 feet from the ground in a spray of reddish color
which extinguished before reaching the ground - this occurred about 10°
yards north of the road on which he was driving - 10 miles east of
Vaughn, N. M. - Highway 60.

On 23 Nov 48 at approximately 2130 hours, Col █ was driving east
in Highway 60 - approximately 10 miles west of Vaughn, N. M. He again
observed a ball of light descending vertically. It burst 100-200 feet
from the ground. Conditions and appearance were the same as on 3 and
4th Nov.

Col █
On the last 2 sightings/saw no aircraft and heard no sound which is
understandable since he was traveling in a closed automobile. Weather
conditions were clear.
