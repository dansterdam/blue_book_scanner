The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with a series of questions and fields for the witness to fill out.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? (The witness has provided a response to this question).

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (The witness has circled "Yes" to this question.)

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: No sound
b. Color: Bright white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? (The witness has provided a response to this question.)

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trails or vapor trails.

Auburn, New York 13021
Gentlemen:
On thenite of .Agust 6,1965, ut about 11:45 n.m., I
and my wife saw lihts in the night sky that I would like to report to you.
There was one white light that seemed to be about the size of the moon, slowly moving across the sky from east to west. As it passed overhead, it dimmed out, then became bright again, dimming out two or three times. It moved in a straight line, and was visible for about 10-15 minutes. This light was completely silent.
There was also a second light that appeared to be about the same size, or a little smaller, than the first one. This light moved in a zig-zag pattern, making sharp turns, and was visible for about 3-5 minutes. This light was also completely silent.
When the first light finally disappeared, a third light appeared slightly to the north of where the first one had been. This third light made a very sharp turn to the south, then disappeared from sight. It was also silent.
I have always been interested in astronomy, and I can assure you that these were not stars, planets, or any type of aircraft that I have ever seen. I feel that these were some type of unidentified flying objects, and I would be most interested in any information you might have on similar sightings in this area.
Sincerely,

Dear Project,
I don't know if I should report this, but I feel I must. Today I saw the so-called disc, said to be hovering, at about 2:45 p.m. and was quite close. I decided to travel the route again tonight, arriving home at about 3:45 a.m. and still traveling with care for obvious reasons.

I feel that I have already reported such a thing before, but I would like to call your attention to the fact that so many good and reliable townspeople have had good reason to turn in reports on the night of August 23, 1965. I would like to make sure that this night of strange things is not forgotten, and that the significance of an incident is not lost in a mass of reports, since there were many.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the unredacted text found in the document:

I responded to an optical siting of an unidentified aerial object in the sky over Auburn, New York on August 7, 1965. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes, beginning at about 9:45 PM EDT. The object was reported to be round or oval in shape, with flashing lights around the perimeter, and appeared to be controlled and directed in its movements. The object was observed at low altitude, approximately 1000 to 1500 feet. The object appeared to change direction abruptly, move in a zig-zag fashion, and at times, appeared to hover. Several other residents of Auburn reported observing the same object at the same time. I was unable to identify the object.
