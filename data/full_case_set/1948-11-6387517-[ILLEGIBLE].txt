Due to the low quality and partially covered text, many words and sections are illegible. The text likely refers to an intelligence report and includes some actions to be taken as well as references to classified information. It also mentions a letter of history and some directive or process scheduled after 15 years. This document appears to be part of standard military correspondence about an unidentified event or object, typical of Project Blue Book, which investigated UFO sightings in the mid-20th century.

Incident #255 - near Vaughn, New Mexico

It is difficult to ascertain whether the objects described
in this incident belong to the general group of "new looking green
fireballs," or not. The description here is sufficiently different
from the majority to indicate that they do not: the characteristics
green color is not mentioned.

It is noteworthy, however, that the three separate sightings,
all occurring at approximately 2200 hours and in the same locality,
can be explained as astronomical phenomena. Furthermore, the stated
altitude and distance are entirely out of keeping; this fact might
be discounted as an illusion, common in the observation of fireballs,
if the instance were isolated. The weight of the evidence, however,
inclines to the conclusion that the objects were man-made devices
and part of some scientific experiments, so common in that section
of the country.

The following information has been received from the Fourth Army Intelligence Liaison Officer, Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico, dated 6 December 1948.

"Colonel ******, Inf., Executive, New Mexico Military District reports as follows:

“On 3 or 4 November 1948 at approximately 2130 hours, I observed a ball of light, reddish white in color, 1 foot in diameter, falling vertically. The ball burst 100-200 feet from the ground in a spray of reddish color which extinguished before reaching the ground. This occurred about 100 yards north of the road on which I was driving. The location was approximately 10 miles east of Vaughn, New Mexico, on Highway 60. (B-2)

“On 23 November 1948, at approximately 2130 hours, I was driving west on Highway 60, about 10 miles west of Vaughn, New Mexico. I observed a ball of light, descending vertically, which burst 100-200 feet from the ground. The conditions and appearance were the same as occurred on 3 - 4 November. (B-2)

"Colonel ****** stated that this did not appear to be meteorological. They might have been connected with some Air Force exercises. He further stated his high opinion of my sincerity in reporting this incident, which is understandable as he was travelling in a closed automobile. Weather conditions were clear." (B-2)

Incident: 225

Colonel ████ first observed an unusual aerial phenomena during the
latter part of 1947. This occurred in the vicinity of Vaughn, N. M.
The phenomena appeared approximately 400-500 ft above the ground
when first observed and was descending slowly and steadily in a vertical
manner toward the earth. It appeared slightly larger than a basketball,
bright white in color like a miniature sun. At a point approximately
200 feet above the surface of the earth, the object appeared to explode
although no noise was apparent. By this time the Colonel had stopped
his automobile and had gotten out to watch the object. The explosion
or disintegration appeared to be taking place some 100 to 60 yards
distant and still no noise was noticed. At this time the fragments
distributed a fiery red color and descended toward the earth like numerous
sparks being extinguished before touching the ground. At the time
Col Hayes was on Highway 60, near a railroad and separated from the
vicinity where the fragments were landing by a fence. He did not cross
the fence or investigate further.

On 3 or 4 Nov 181 at approximately 2130 hours he observed a ball of  
light, reddish white in color, 1 foot in diameter, falling vertically.
The ball burst 100-200 feet from the ground in a spray of red color
which extinguished before reaching the ground - this occurred about 400
yards north of the road on which he was driving - 10 miles east of
Vaughn, N. M. - Highway 60.

On 23 Nov 1948 at approximately 2130 hours, Col ████ who was driving west
on Highway 60 - approximately 10 miles west of Vaughn, N. M. He again
observed a ball of light descending vertically. It burst 100-200 feet
from the ground - Conditions and appearance were the same as on 3 and
14th Nov.

Col ████
On the last 2 sightings/saw no aircraft and heard no sound which is
understandable since he was traveling in a closed automobile. Weather
conditions were clear.
