UNCLASSIFIED
Albuquerque, New Mexico 28 December 1952

I. Description of Incident: 
At 2309 CST a military pilot sighted an elongated cigar-like object about the size of a medium transport plane. It traveled from east to west over Albuquerque, New Mexico. All sightings were visual from a period of 10 to 15 seconds. There were broken high clouds.

II. Discussion of Incident:
All air traffic in the area was identified by Kirtland AFB. The object had no trail, common to some meteors. However, it was not enough contrast, color, size, or speed to be a meteor. I1 addition, the aircraft was, as reported, operating normally and there was no distress or evasive action. ANDC in its final report stated an answer might be found here.

III. Conclusion: Insufficient information.

UNCLASSIFIED
Saturday, December 27, 1952, 4:42 p.m.
A military investigation on Kirtland tower, Albuquerque, New Mexico, was reported.
A MILITARY OPERATION: As to the object observed, according to the dimensions now available, this object was a circular round mass of arc in a diameter of 50-100 ft. or more, hovering over a certain area with a slight and oscillating motion, sometimes tilting or rotating on its axis. It seemed to be giving off a strange illumination and glowed in a weird fashion.
This object was traveling east to west in a curved path in a steady course which would indicate a controlled direction and in a manner that would contrast with an erratic zig-zag flight path. This description is rather detailed and the object was under careful observation for approximately 10-12 minutes. No doubt this was a military operation in connection with some aircraft or aerial device.
CONDITIONS: Mild, day to day, first sighting. The object from her was about the size of a dime held at arm's length. It was reported to have moved very quickly up and down, been obscured by clouds at times, and disappeared behind the clouds on one or two occasions. After several seconds, I looked toward the horizon field, and I think I saw the light of an aircraft flickering and disappearing quickly.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified flying objects, El Paso and Amarillo, Texas
DATE OF INFORMATION: 19 September 1952

The text in the document is as follows:

In accordance with AFR 200-2, dated 29 April 1952, subject: Unidentified flying objects is submitted. The following reports of unidentified flying objects are submitted:

On 27 September 1952, at 6:16 P.M., Central Airlines pilot, shortly after leaving Amarillo, Texas, observed an unusual aerial phenomenon. The object was first spotted from the northeast, gaining altitude as it approached the aircraft. It moved to the southwest at a high rate of speed, estimated at approximately 1500 miles per hour. The object appeared to be disc-shaped, approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, and glowing with a white-blue light. The pilot stated that the object appeared to be several thousand feet above his aircraft and was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed. The object seemed to stop and hover momentarily, then accelerated and disappeared to the southwest. Two other Central Airlines pilots, who were in radio contact with the first pilot, also observed the object. No other traffic was in the area at the time of the observation. The pilot stated he had never seen anything like it before.

This report is submitted for your information and three copies of this report are forwarded to Central Air Defense Command, Ent Air Force Base, Colorado Springs, Colorado.
