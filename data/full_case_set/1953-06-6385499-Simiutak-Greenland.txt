UNKNOWN

Brief Summary and Analysis:
Body, circular, pulsating, glowing object observed with binoculars. Object hovering at high altitude approx 30,000 ft. Object noted is similar to other reports in that it was observed to be circular in shape, pulsating and glowing. However, conclusion could not be drawn as type of object since the maneuver and behavior noted was not sufficient evidence to determine identity of object. This type balloon not common in area.

AREA REPORTED ON: Simiutak (BW-3), Greenland
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object  
FROM: 66117th Air Base Group Intelligence
SOURCE: A/C Richard A. Hill AF 11 173 575
REFERENCES: None
SUMMARY: 
1. At 14:42, 24 June 1953, A/C Richard A. Hill AF 11 173 575, a weather observer with three years experience, was tracking a weather balloon at an altitude of approximately 13,000 feet near the town of Simiutak, Greenland (61N, 46341W). The object was sighted instantly upon explosion of the 100 gram balloon, and was described as 1/2 Hill's state the object had burst the balloon. Description of the object at this time was expressed by the observer as being a "silvery, metallic, circular shaped" object which appeared to climb rapidly under the balloon explosion. The object continued to rise at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet (according to the observer's estimates) for fifteen seconds, then flashed as the altitude gained and finally disappeared after five minutes.  Object was seen by subject individual only.
2. The observer stated that the object disappeared in a northwesterly direction and was under observation for approximately 5 minutes. Winds were calm for five minutes as the object disappeared from view. This correlated with winds aloft at Simiutak showing winds at 10,000 feet 120 degrees at 16 knots, 12,000 feet 120 degrees at 16 knots, 15,000 feet 140 degrees at 20 knots, at Simiutak. The visual and radar reported at the heights between 13,000 and 15,000 feet were estimated at 150 to 200 miles per hour.

STATEMENT

I, A/2c Richard L. Hill AF 11173575, after having been duly sworn, do hereby make the following statement:

As pilot of balloon 1953 and 7 was following the pilot balloon through the theodolite the balloon burst and at its place was a red object. It seemed to be larger at first or second burst than the large red balloon which is about 4 feet in diameter. The balloon was at an altitude of 15,000 feet when it burst. The strange object then proceeded to make a sharp ascent and vertical at same altitude. It made sudden and erratic maneuvers such as a loop. The object was not discernable as to its structure but it did appear to be a definite shape which seemed somewhat triangular. This moving towards the northwest picking up speed rapidly. Upon moving it appeared to be disc shaped and reflecting the sun. It then made a steep climbing maneuver and finally disappearing after five minutes.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT (1220 HRS)
SIMIUTAK, GREENLAND
4 JUNE 1953

SUMMARY
1. At approximately 1220 hrs, 4 June 1953, an unidentified aerial object was observed by T/Sgt ALEX K. BAKER, let Lt THOMAS F. ADAMS, and T/Sgt WILLIAM B. GARRIOTT of the 1st Rescue Squadron, Air Rescue Service, Greenland.

2. The object was a round, white, shiny object which was observed to travel in a straight line at a high rate of speed for approximately 30 seconds when it then disappeared.

3. There was no sound associated with the object.

4. An attempt was made to identify the object as some known type of aircraft, but no such identification could be made.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. 25-36-53 
PAGE 2 OF 2

1. An unidentified aerial object was sighted over a Thule Force, Greenland site on 24 June 1953 at 2345Z.

2. The 5th Weather Detachment at "Narssaup" AD advised that the 2415002 pilot balloon at Thule had disappeared from view. It was tracking at 18,000 feet and was last observed at 15,000 feet.

3. The object was described as being circular, silver in color, and about 30-40 feet in diameter. It was traveling at an estimated speed of 900 knots and heading in a westerly direction.

4. The observer continued to watch the object for five minutes until it disappeared from view. It did not trail and seemed to be at an estimated altitude of 20,000 feet.

5. The 5th Weather Detachment at "Narrsaup" AD advised that the 2415002 pilot balloon at Thule had disappeared from view. It was tracking at 18,000 feet and was last observed at 15,000 feet.

COMMENTS of the Preparing Officers
1. Considerable evidence to be considered in a preliminary evaluation are:
(a) The object was observed through binoculars by trained observers. 
(b) It appeared to be a unique and unusual object.
(c) The flight characteristics observed are indicative of a "guided" or "controlled" object.

2. The possibility that the object was in some way caused by the "weather phenomenon" under observation, i.e., the lost pilot balloon, cannot be eliminated.

3. Although the speed of 900 knots is generally considered excessive for presently known aircraft, the possibility of extremely high performance vehicles cannot be discounted.

4. Complete analysis of the incident is being forwarded to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Project Blue Book.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. R-1-53
COUNTRY: Greenland
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object (SIMIUTAK)
DATE INFORMATION: 26 June 1953
FLIGHT INFORMATION: Major, USAF
STATEMENT:
a. Reference your message AFOIN-AT-AIR-G-23-53, 30 June 1952 concerning the Simiutak flying object case.
b. Collision of object and pitball was seen through the theodolites.
c. Pitball conditions were scattered in clouds at 8,500 feet and 25,000 feet with visibility of about 3,000 feet.
d. A one hundred foot pitball would not be expected to burst below 35,000 feet and probably not until 45,000 feet depending upon the pressure-altitude conditions and instruments. The Commander of the 13th Weather Detachment states that it is doubtful that this condition or particle in the air would be an optical illusion.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
IDENTIFICATION: RALPH WALLACE, JR., Major, USAF
UNIT: Commander 8/13th Weather Detachment
SUMMARY: (Unidentified Flying Object (FLYOBJECT): Project Blue Book. 
a. Collected for evidence and details evaluation. See through the rhodolite. 
b. Neither the small nor the object could be seen by the naked eye at 20,000 feet and 20,000 feet with visibility as twenty-five miles.
c. A one hundred green fireball would not be expected to burst below 30,000 feet and possibly not until 40,000 feet or higher, depending upon the pressure. There was no associated sound or blast effect. In his opinion the only possibility of a phenomena would be an optical illusion or possible in the land of the iceodlite.
