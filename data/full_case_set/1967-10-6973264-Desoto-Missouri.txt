The image does not contain any photographs, only a filled-out document form with text. As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes, appeared to go out
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One): Yes No Don't know. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound: None b. Color: Bright white light
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the width of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the known object would have been covered?  The object seemed very large in the sky, covering a large portion of the sky, perhaps 10 to 15 degrees.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

26. In order that I can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

the object was round and silver in color with a range in size of 30 ft. to 60 ft. in diameter. The object hovered silently over the area for 15 to 20 minutes and then accelerated at a rapid speed, making a 90 degree turn and disappearing from sight.

The image contains a sketch, but no photograph. The sketch appears to be an illustration depicting how to determine the altitude of an unidentified object in the sky based on its position relative to the horizon and a compass.

OCR text output:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how low the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object; place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
