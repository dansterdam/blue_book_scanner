SIMILAR NATURE. THE RELIABILITY OF THE OBSERVER IS QUESTIONED SOMEWHAT AS TO
ACCURACY AND DETAIL:
1. OBJECT: (S) WHITE BALL OF LIGHT ABOUT SIZE OF BASKETBALL, FLASHING ON AND
OFF AT IRREGULAR INTERVALS. OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A GLOW FROM WITHIN RATHER
THAN FROM REFLECTION OR LIGHT. 
2. MOTION: (5) OBJECT MOVED ERRATICALLY WITH SUDDEN STARTS AND STOPS -
CHANGING DIRECTIONS FREQUENTLY - ESTIMATED SPEED BETWEEN 100-200 MPH.
3. DURATION: (S) OBJECT OBSERVED FOR 15 MINUTES BY WEATHER OBSERVER WHO WAS
TAKING A ROUTINE CHECK. OBJECT WAS VISIBLE THROUGH A HAZE OR FOG CONDITION
OF POOR VISIBILITY.
4. SOUND: (S) NO NOISE ASSOCIATED WITH OBJECT OBSERVED.
5. STATIONARY: (S) FADED OUT OF SIGHT AT ABOUT 30 DEGREES ANGLE FROM HORIZON.  
INCREASING IN INTENSITY MANNER OF OBSERVATION: (S) GROUND OBSERVER
GENERAL COMMENT: (S) OBJECT RETURNED ON 14 FEB AFTER PERIOD OF NO
ACTIVITY (8) JANUARY 58. (S) IT DOES NOT FIT THE PATTERN OF KNOWN OR EXPECTED
TYPES OF AIRCRAFT OR MISSILES.

CO2 FOR HIGHER LEVELS ARE AVAILABLE. WEATHER GROUP, TEMPORARY INACTIVE PARAGRAPH CHART INDICATES AN INSTANT RISE OF PRESSURE FROM 29.531 TO 29.582 ON FEBRUARY 28, INDICATING AN INSTANT RISE OF PRESSURE FROM 29.55 TO 29.85.

TENTATIVE ANALYSIS - St. Lawrence Island 
UFO SIGHTING 23 FEB 58

Basic, Essential Data:
1. Semi-circular in shape; first jagged on top - latter smoothing off
2. Size: about half dollar. However, note: AS OBSERVED THRU 7 X 50 BINOCULARS, (object) was therefore 1/7 this size to naked eye.
3. Stationary. No movement reported.
4. Almost one half hour in sight.
5. Direction (Azimuth) from Ob. Pt. - approximately 285" (Rept. states could be plus or minus 15°)

Missing Essential Data: 
1. Azimuth given - but no elevation.
Char[acter] liability of observer (St. Lawrence Island) from Northeast Cape (observer's point) until UFO was lost almost directly overhead to terminate on 1330Z.
2. If the elevation is low - possible that it could have been some light object on the Island itself, (a few miles point) (although the conditions would seem to mitigate against this).
3. If an elevation was high, it could indicate unknown activities or operations taking place in the Gulf of Anadyrsky area.

Significant Points:
1. The bright star Capella was in the exact line of sight given by the observer, at approximately 40°- 45° elevation (which was not given).
2. With binoculars (and the known characteristics of planets and stars observed at high latitudes) this star would appear unusual, particularly if observed through haze or fog. Note, that the object remained STATIONARY for almost one half hour!
3. Although stationary for an exceptionally (for UFOs) long period, neither of the two radios could pick it up.
4. Any explosion (leaving smoke, mushroom debris, etc.) would normally not remain suspended, with the same shape, for such a period of time.

CONCLUSIONS
On the basis of the limited data given, and pending receipt of further data, it is the opinion that the object observed probably was an astronomical body.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a project Blue Book document, which is a declassified United States Air Force unit that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text of the document is as follows:

JOINT MESSAGEFORM - CONTINUATION SHEET
COMDR ATIC
WESTERN SHORE: IF HIGH ANGLE, POSSIBILITY OF UNKNOWN SOVIET ACTIVITIES OR OPERATIONS MAY BE CONSIDERED.
1. YOUR HYPOTHESIS: HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT ANY SMOKE, MUSHROOM CLOUD, ETC. RESULTING FROM AN EXPLOSION WOULD REMAIN IN SAME POSITION, WITHOUT CHANGE IN SHAPE FOR ALMOST ONE HALF HOUR.
2. SIGNIFICANT TO POINT OUT THAT BRIGHT STAR CAPELLA IN ALMOST EXACT AZIMUTH GIVEN BY OBSERVER, AT ABOUT 40 TO 50 DEGREES ELEVATION. UNUSUAL APPEARANCE OF CELESTIAL BODIES OBSERVED IN ARCTIC REGIONS, AND ESPECIALLY IF OBSERVED THROUGH BINOCULARS IN DARK WELL KNOWN TO UFO ANALYSTS, PARTICULARLY IF ANY HAZE, FOG, ETC. EXISTS BETWEEN OBSERVE AND OBJECT.
3. REQUEST ACTION BE TAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 48 AND 65, AFR 200-2, AND THE RESULTS MADE KNOWN TO THIS CENTER.
