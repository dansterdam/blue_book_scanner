INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORTS

Two reports of unidentified flying object sightings, made on the night of 4 Feb 54, were received by ATIC from the 19th Air Division, Carswell Air Force Base, Texas. These appeared to be significant in that the reporting officer and the observers were experienced and reliable personnel and the reported actions of the objects were unusual. This was also reported as possibly being a simultaneous visual and radar sighting. 
The first object was reported as being the shape of an aircraft, dark grey, as large or larger than a B-36, having a long fuselage, elliptical wings and stabilizers. All descriptions fit that of an aircraft except that it was reported as having no visible means of propulsion or exhaust, nor did the object leave any trail. The most predominant phenomena was that the object emitted no sound.

This object was first detected by the Carswell GCA radar at 2300 at a distance of 13 to 15 miles to the SW and heading directly toward the base. It remained on a straight course and the GCA operator notified the control tower and the officer of the day. The control tower personnel sighted the object at 2301 and kept it under observation for five minutes until 2306 when it passed out of sight to the NW. The object was estimated to be traveling at an altitude of between 3000 to 4000 feet. A straight course was maintained throughout both the visual and radar sightings.

This same report and a subsequent report contained information on a further radar sighting which occurred on the same night some 20 minutes after the original visual and radar sightings. It appeared that the proximity of time might link the two sightings.

The second incident concerning radar only was picked up by the Carswell AFB GCA at 2329 on the night of 4 Feb 54. The return on the scope indicated [...]

targets 17 miles SW of Carswell AFB, flying in formation at an estimated alti-
tude of 5000 feet and speed of 200 NM. These two targets merged into one
and when 12 miles from Carswell they separated again and followed a souther-
ly heading. At approximately 14 miles from the base, the target to the rear
suddenly reversed its course, flew for two miles, then reversed course again
and gradually overtook the lead target. Both targets departed the capability
of the GCA flying in formation to the SSE.

On the basis of the above information, a call was placed by ATIC to HQ Air
Defense Command and a request was made to have the nearest unit of the 4602d
AISS proceed to Carswell AFB for the purpose of carrying out a complete inves-
tigation of the sightings.

Capt Charles A. Hardin, project monitor for Project Blue Book, and Mr.
████████, radar specialist, departed from ATIC for Carswell AFB to further
the investigation. Upon arrival, a team was formed with 4602d AISS and intel-
ligence personnel at Carswell AFB.

The initial UFO report from Carswell had indicated that there were no
aircraft in the area on the night of the sighting which would meet the UFO
descriptions; however, in the course of a routine recheck, it was discovered
that a C-124 enroute from Travis AFB to Turner AFB had reported in to the
Ft. Worth radio at 2300 and had changed flight plan at that time. The new
flight plan called for a descent from 13,000 to 7000 and the course from Ft.
Worth radio to the east leg of the radio direction beam would carry the plane
very near the Carswell AFB control tower.

The radar track on this sighting as well as the time coincided with the
flight plan of the C-124 and the visual observations. It is, therefore, con-
cluded that it was this C-124 which the control tower personnel reported.

The lack of sound was accounted for by the descent of the C-124 which was
taking place at the time of the sighting together with the under-estimation of
altitude by the reporting personnel.

The image contains two drawings, not photographs:

1. The first drawing is a demonstration of sighting an unidentified object. It shows a semi-circular frame, an arched trajectory marked with "A" at the beginning and "B" at the end, depicting the movement of the object across the sky. There is a burst of lines at the bottom left, suggesting the origin or movement direction of the object.

2. The second drawing is more detailed and depicts a view down a road lined with trees and houses, simulating a person's perspective. A small disk-like object is marked with dots forming a dashed line across the sky from left to right, starting at "A" and ending at "B," showing the observed path of the object overhead.

---
Since the first sighting was established to be the C-12k there appears to be no relation between this and the second radar sighting.

Mr. _____ after interrogating the GCA operator, was of the opinion that the reported returns indicated aircraft with the exception of the sudden reversal of course (for about 2 miles or 3.3 seconds) and the investigation was continued on that basis. The Duncanville radar station was alerted, after the target of interest reportedly temporarily reversed its course, and their recorded tracks of this target(s) were those of normal aircraft traveling at about 240 NM. A check was made through flight service for all flight plans; however, no flights of this description could be found. Since flight service has plans on cross-country flights only, a further check was initiated to all surrounding air fields for furlough information on local or round robin flights which might have been in the area at the time of the sightings.

Through this checking of surrounding bases, it was found that the 367TRS WACO SQ, James Connley AFB, which is a radar observers training school was carrying out corrections on the night of the fourth in the vicinity and covering the same time period. These operations consisted of flights of two B-25's running missions on each other. While their exact locations at any given time could not be determined, the maneuvers described by the radar operator were very similar and lead to the belief that these were the same objects as reported.

       Commander, ATIC
       ATIAA-5/Capt Bardin/Joe/73147
       9 February 1954

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

PROBLEM:

1. To request approval for Capt C. A. Bardin and Mr. R. L. James 
to travel to Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas, for the purpose
of determining the origin of a reported unidentified flying object.

FACTS AND DISCUSSION:

2. On 5 Feb 54 at 0500, a sighting was made in the vicinity of 
Carswell AFB by both visual observation and radar. The object was ob-
served by all the Carswell Tower personnel on duty. All of the observers
are considered reliable.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

3. This appears to be a significant case and complete investigation 
should be carried out. It is, therefore, recommended that Capt C. A. 
Hardin and Mr. R. L. James proceed to Carswell Air Force Base, Texas, for
approximately 5 days TDY.

COORDINATION:

ATIC/Lt Col B. C. Johnston, Branch Chief

The image does not contain a photograph; instead, it shows a hand-drawn diagram. The diagram seems to represent a top view of circular bands labeled with numbers 5 through 35 at intervals, possibly indicating distance or elevation levels. A dashed line extends from the south to the approximate center, where there’s an indication of direction and possibly a pivotal point labeled "W" and "E". Some scribbled lines and X marks appear, possibly indicating movement or specific observations related to the diagram.

Here's the text content from the document:

---

71637 0000 ALLC Tine

At 2320 CST observed 8 blips on scope about
12 mi. SW. Big % of blips were normal for a
C-47 in formation flying 050º. After 1 minute
2 blips merged and flew about 1 mile, then
separated again and were about ½ to 2 mile apart,
They then turned north and after traveling north
about 1 minute one blip reversed course without
making a visible turn. the target held this
northward heading about 45 seconds, then reversed
course and flew south showing catching
up with the other Target I saw north
still they went off scope. Alt, est2000.
