NEW YORK, N.Y. 10028

April 26, 1966

Department of Air Force
Pentagon
Washington, D. C.

Dear Sirs:

In light of the discussion concerning UFO's, and with a certain amount of diffidence, I feel I should make this report. I certainly do not have an explanation.

On Friday, April 22, 1966, I was driving north on Route 22 N.Y. heading for Bennett College to visit my wife's sister. As I approached 7:15 P.M., I was around Middletown, N.Y. It was getting dark, about 7:30 or 8:00 P.M. It was dusk and although a crescent moon could be seen then there was a brightly lighted, but suddenly a still quite light. There is a hill to the east and woods to the west of the road.

I saw a bluegreen ball of light moving fairly rapidly, low, horizontally in the sky from east to north or east to west. I couldn't tell distance and yet it first thought it was a ball like those that are shot from Roman candles. I looked for another fire work display but there was none and the ball didn't seem to be fire works. The color was a clear bluegreen light like an exhaust east of the ball and I thought it must be sending some sort of comet with a trail. It was either quite close or moving very rapidly now above the road ahead of me. Then it seemed to climb the white light trail became suddenly brighter and disappeared. At that point the green light started to some down, in the angle of a plane on final approach to move slightly ahead of the other and then it was behind the trees as though it had landed. I never saw any flying object - only these lights.

I couldn't find a nearby landing field on the charts I looked over the weekend and also realized that had it been a plane, the light on that wing would have been red. 

Very truly yours,
[Redacted]
