1. QUESTIONS

1. What type radar equipment is involved?

CPS-5

2. Has there been any recent maintenance difficulties? If so, describe. 

NO

3. What type modulator (i.e., spark gap, hard tube, etc.) is used in this radar equipment?

DRYATRONS

4. Does the AFC (automatic frequency control) circuit of the receiver operate properly?

YES

5. Has interference from another radar set been observed recently, and are personnel familiar with the effect caused by an interfering signal?

NO

6. What type indicators, "A scope", "B scope", etc., were used to follow the target?

P.P.I.

7. What was the radar scan rate?

5

8. What was the approximate frequency of the transmitter?

1278 MG

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS. DOD DIR 5200.10

II. GENERAL QUESTIONS

1. What were the general weather conditions at the time unidentified target was observed?

GOOD

Temperature taken from nearby U.S. St monitor station is unreliable as temperature varies greatly with proximity to altitude, sun and velocity of the wind.

Finland, Minnesota ​                                                                                                                February 1953

I. Description of Incident

     At 0629 CST an unknown object appeared on a radar scope on a heading of 155° at the 140  mile range. The object appeared on the scope as being twice the size of an ordinary aircraft.

II. Discussion of Incident

     The radar station involved sent ATIC an Electronics Data Sheet covering the sighting and from this, electronics specialists determined that interference from another radar station caused the presence of the unknown "blip". No visual observation was made at any time.

III. Conclusion

      Interference.
