II. RELIABILITY: Source was a reliable, observant and preserved sort of individual and seemed somewhat confused when questions were asked. Before answering questions, he stated that a medium-sized object that was white in color was observed

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source was looking north-northeast when objects appeared. He was looking northeast when objects disappeared. They were observed for a period of thirty minutes.
Objects appeared to be round or rotating. Brightness was like that of an automobile headlight at a mile or rotating object - some hold at some light. Movement of objects was erratic, appearing to stand still and then suddenly appear in a different area. One of the objects disappeared suddenly.
Objects were estimated from 35 degrees from the north and rotated in a circular path to 20 degrees east and 30 degrees from the horizon when they disappeared. He estimated the distance from objects at 15,000 feet.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS:

1. A check was made with the weather station at Lincoln AFB, Nebr. and the wind readings at 2100 CST, 12 Feb 57 were:

Surface - calm
6,000* - 290 degrees at 30 knots
10,000* - 320 degrees at 45 knots
16,000* - 280 degrees at 60 knots
20,000* - 310 degrees at 80 knots
30,000* - 310 degrees at 80 knots
40,000* - 290 degrees at 70 knots

This station only releases ceiling balloons and then only when sighting, and the balloons were clear on the day of sighting. It was learned here, that balloons are released at Omaha, Nebr. by Universal Weather Service for the Air Force, on this schedule: balloons would have been released at 2100 CST, 12 Feb 57.

Universally it is an attempt to gain further information. This will verify the information gained and also attempt to determine what the weather conditions were at the time, and what the flying conditions were that the objects engaged in. They were engaged in lengthy research requiring the release of balloons.

At the University of Nebraska, it was learned from Mr. that the University of Nebraska Balloon Research Department also does research on sightings of UFO's. He was contacted and they reported no activity on that date, since they maintain no regular schedule of balloon releases, but engage in research when they feel it is necessary.

CAA radio at Omaha, Nebr. was contacted and they reported no activity or sighting on that date. They did report, however, that flying conditions on that date were overcast and only limited visibility was possible. There was nothing unusual observed or reported in their area on that date.

Through flight service at Lowry AFB, Colo., it was learned that under VFR conditions at Denver airport, there would have been good visibility those nights; however, the airport was closed that night due to bad weather. So there would have been no unusual activity reported.

Comments of the Preparing Officer:
1. The opinion of the Preparing Officer is that these objects were probably caused by reflecting surfaces and were not the result of all sources who visually observed objects stated that there was a resemblance to filtering balloons used in commercial aircraft.
2. Statements made by United Air Lines that it was possible that three of their flights could have been in the area at the time of the sighting.
The fact that the object was observed by radar indicates that the flashing lights observed were being carried by a visible capable of strong reflecting surfaces.
Comments of Reviewing Officer:
1. The reviewing officer concurs in the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was probably caused by reflecting surfaces and was not the result of any unconventional aircraft.
2. The opinion is based on the following:
a. The objects were generally observed from north to west. This area is the direction of the nearest commercial air routes.
b. The objects were observed to move at a rate comparable to commercial aircraft operating in that area.
c. The presence of the objects was not confirmed by other radar sites in the area, as would normally be expected if the objects were unconventional aircraft.
3. Therefore, it is the opinion of the reviewing officer that this sighting was probably the result of reflecting surfaces, such as balloons or aircraft, and does not represent evidence of unconventional aircraft.
Possibly Balloon Evaluation:
The national defense of the United States could be adversely affected if information concerning the national defense of the United States was divulged. Therefore, the identity of the individuals involved in this incident will not be revealed.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
12 February 1957
LaGuardia A/P, New York

February 12, 1957. At 7:10 p.m. a New York Airways helicopter, approaching LaGuardia, noticed that they had an object "ship-shaped" like a blimp with a red light in sight over the Aquacade of the old World's Fair site. The tower replied that about 15 minutes before they "had one there ... with an explosive, wide light." It went up and down for a while. Some pilots saw it, others didn't. (Credited: LaGuardia A/P)

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing the sighting of maneuver lights by a police officer and others in Burbank, California on February 13, 1957. The text details the officer's observations of the lights, including their speed, course, and sudden changes in direction. The document also mentions information that was included in letters to the U.S. Air Force and the L.A. Mirror-News.

POLICE OFFICER AND OTHERS WATCH MANEUVERING NIGHT LIGHTS
February 13, 1957

On the evening of February 13, 1957 the information in this case obtained directly from the observer, Mr. ____ of Burbank, California, who reported the details to us.

Officer ____ of the Burbank, California Police Force, was dispatched at 6:30 P.M. to investigate a report of an object over Lockheed property in the San Fernando Valley. As he was told to look up toward the horizon to the north where he observed an extremely bright light which was slowly descending toward his location. As the light came closer, it began to accelerate at a high rate of speed toward his right. In motion, the light blinked on and off several times, and seemed to be rotating. It reversed its course, sweeping back toward the area from whence it had come. As it neared the observer, the light appeared to be a very large brilliant white light which illuminated a large bird-like shape which he could not identify.

Then the second light made a sudden right-angle turn. Following this, the two objects turned so that they were receding away from each other. Finally Officer ____ could watch only one object at a time; first he would watch one light, then the other. Both lights had been too far above the horizon - 60 to 70 degrees - to have been conventional aircraft. The display lasted about 15 minutes. Besides the information contained in Mr. ____'s letters to the U.S. Air Force, and the L.A. Mirror-News, 2/14/57, no other details were gleaned from the information at hand.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)

16 February 1957
Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire
White Plains, New Mexico

February 16, 1957 - A spectacularly brilliant blue-green fireball exploded over the vicinity of Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts at about 4:25 a.m. The light was seen over sections of three states. Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, and was described by one person as "resembling ball-like objects described elsewhere in this issue." - Boston Globe, 2/17, etc.

February 16, 1957 - Another fireball-type UFO (or actual fireball) was seen by White Plains policemen and his wife at about 7 p.m. when they saw a brilliant blue-green object streak to the west at a high rate of speed. It was irregular in shape and appeared to be about 25 to 30 feet in diameter. It was traveling at high speed on a horizontal trajectory to the south, at a constant elevation of about 150°. In turning away to concentrate on the road, the driver of the car reported he last saw it on a compass bearing of 245° (S.W.). His wife watched it disappear behind the building in front of the car. There was an impression of a tail, but again we request any additional information that might be supplied by readers.

No Case (Information Only)

20 February 1957
Westchester County, Pa.

February 20, 1957. Two F-86's were sent aloft to investigate a translucent, oddly shaped object. According to the information, coming from a CSIR member (who asks that his name be withheld), the object was sighted over Westchester County Airport around noon. He was driving to the airport when he saw the object. It was translucent in color, and in the shape of a full moon. It did not move. As the two jets headed toward the object, the witness were in his car, looking to get home to watch the event through binoculars. Driving away, he saw the jets making passes around the object. This was the last he saw of the object. Apparently the observer felt that the object might possibly have been a partially deflated weather balloon, although he was definite that he did not see the object drifting with the wind or floating to the earth. The day was very clear and quite cold, the observer himself did not notice any wind.

No Case (Information Only)
21 February 1957
White Plains, New Mexico

February 21, 1957 - On this occasion it was seen from 9:35 p.m. to 10:15 p.m. This time two highly interesting maneuvers were performed by a pair of objects. After it began to rock back and forth like a pendulum again, and following this, the two pairs of smaller red objects were again launched upward. About 10 minutes afterward, the object rose and disappeared, seeming to be "turned off."

The reported incidents were investigated by Bill Blades and John Burton of White Plains. Although the repetitive nature of the phenomenon is perplexing, the reddish objects still remain astronomically unidentifiable; however, they cannot identify it with any star or planet.

No Case (Information Only)                   21 February 1957     Yokahama, Japan

1957 brought the advent of the so-called "space age" with the Russian launching of its first Sputnik, but 15 other objects were observed on that night. On February 22, another photograph of five glowing objects in flycatching formation was taken. Of these, the Japanese newspaper called the UFO investigation one of the most serious for a long time. UFO investigators regard Japan as an outstanding area, since ten or eleven authentic reports of close UFO-human encounters were received from that location.

II. RELIABILITY: Source stated his description of sighting and was convinced it is reliable. It is believed by the Investigator that he could be considered reliable.

III. DESCRIPTION of SIGHTING: On or about midnight, at least three objects were observed from the control tower at Lincoln AFB, Nebr. on 13 Feb 57 for about 7-10 minutes. The objects were hovering at 3000-4000 ft, circular in shape, and appeared to be under intelligent control. They were observed in the northeast, and disappeared into the northwest. Source estimate their speed at times up to 1000 mph.

Objects were red in color and color ranged constant as did the speed of objects but said they were traveling at a steady pace. Objects appeared to be solid at times and could not detect any sound or trail.

Source stated that objects made no particular impression on him and did not think of them as UFOB's, therefore he did not report them.

II. RELIABILITY: Source appeared to be of average intelligence and was responsible in his efforts to help solve this problem. He had a firm conviction that he had never seen objects such as these and carefully thought out his statements.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source's attention was brought to this incident and he called it to the attention of the military personnel at the Lincoln AFB tower. He noticed and to the east where he last saw the objects, noticing that they were extremely bright and moving in a wiggly motion. They were at a relative high speed and appeared to be quite large objects. When they increased in speed the size did not seem to change nor did their brightness. Source estimated the objects were five to ten miles from and quite high up. After watching for approximately 15 minutes the objects gradually faded from view.

III. RELIABILITY: Source was sincere and eager to help. His ability to describe the sighting was considered outstanding, considering the length of time elapsed at the time.

IV. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 13 Feb 57 at 0315 CST, Source was a B-47 aircraft in the CCA pattern preparing for a landing at Lincoln AFB, Nebraska. The control tower operator advised Source to continue outbound from the field, as there was a known commercial air liner in the area. Source continued outbound and was at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet when he observed an object about five-to-six miles to the east of his position, traveling twice as fast as the commercial airliner he had been advised about. The object appeared to be about the size of a basketball (approximately) and Source witnessed it moving twice as fast as the commercial airliner. Source continued to observe the object for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. At the time there were some scattered clouds in the sky and visibility was good. Objects were interrogated on three passes of IFF with no response. Source stated he could not identify the shape of the object, however, the blip on his scope was about the size of a 100 degree blip. The single object observed was last seen at approximately 0320 CST when it disappeared from his scope.
