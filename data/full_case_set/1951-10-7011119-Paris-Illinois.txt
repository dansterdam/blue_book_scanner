Appendix IX
PARIS, ILLINOIS - 9 OCTOBER 1951
On 9 October 1951, at approximately 1745 CDT, a private pilot on a routine flight from Springfield, Illinois, to Paris, Illinois, observed an object that appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 2 minutes and then disappeared from sight. The object appeared to the observer to be metallic in size and in size with the approach of the aircraft. The observer attempted to pursue the object but was unable to do so.
(See Appendix VIII for related incident.)
WEATHER:
Clear, bright sun, no clouds or haze.
DETAILS OF INVESTIGATION:
From details of the incident, it will be obtained: weather balloons are known to be seen from a distance, of which approximately 5 miles NE of the location of the incident. The very familiar if this is the case, when a balloon is the object which would have risen to a much higher altitude if it had drifted as from Chanute AFB.

TWO SIGHTINGS BY A PROMINENT SCIENTIST IN 
CHARGE OF HIGH-ALTITUDE COSMIC RAY RESEARCH

October 10, 1951 -- Two observers were just starting on a flight and were approaching (in a small plane) from the north an altitude of 8,000 feet. We started to climb towards the balloon on a course of 320 deg. At 9,000 feet I noticed a strange object crossing the skies at a great speed, coming from the northwest. I called the co-pilot's attention to this object and we watched it go behind a cloud, remaining there about a minute. When it emerged, it reversed its course and sped off towards the northwest at a tremendous speed. This object appeared to be about 1/4 the size of the balloon. We were climbing and about 10 miles from the balloon. The object had a peculiar glow to it, crossing behind the balloon from west to east very rapidly, first coming in at a slight dive, traveling for about a minute and then making a sharp left turn and climbing at an angle of 50 to 60 degrees into the northwest at a terrific acceleration and disappeared.

October 11, 1951 -- Four witnesses D. H. and I were flying at 10,000 feet observing the grab bag balloon when I saw what appeared to be the same object to the southeast of the University of M. Airport. I pointed it out to D and we both made the following observations: The object was moving from east to west at a high rate and very high. We tried keeping it in sight on a constant course and using gunsight wings it subtended an angle of one to two mils.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
HEADQUARTERS 33rd SUB-DISTRICT, OSI, DISTRICT OF OHIO
DATE: 7 OCT 1951
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object, Paris, Illinois
1. On 7 October 1951, at approximately 6:00 PM, a resident of Paris, Illinois, observed a luminous object in the sky which was described as being approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, round in shape, and hovering at a height of approximately 500-600 feet. The object was observed for a period of approximately 10-15 minutes. Witnesses stated that the object appeared to be surrounded by a bluish haze and that it emitted no noise. After remaining stationary for a brief period, the object is reported to have accelerated rapidly in a southerly direction and disappeared from sight.
2. A military aircraft was apparently in the area at the time of the observation, and it is believed that the resident who reported the incident may have mistaken this aircraft for the unidentified object. However, the resident is reported to be a reliable and rational individual, and it is not believed that the observation was merely a case of mistaken identity.
3. No other reports of unidentified objects in the Paris, Illinois area have been received.
