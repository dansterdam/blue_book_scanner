The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram. The sketch appears to be instructions or prompts for the observer to respond to, related to describing the position and movement of an unidentified object.

Transcribing the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve where the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the curve to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the curve to show where you first saw it. Place a "D" on the compass - where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.

Dear Mr. Rea,

Thank you very much for the information. I was very interested in the subject itself and wonder if you might possibly help me with any other information you may have. My mother helped me to get the information for the report that I needed and I was wondering if I could use this information for it or if you have any other suggestions.

Sincerely,
