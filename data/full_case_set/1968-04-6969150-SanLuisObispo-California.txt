PROJECT 10/79 RECORD
1. DATE & TIME GROUP: 2/23/52
2. LOCATION: SAN LUIS OBISPO, CALIFORNIA
3. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 5
4. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 MINS
5. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: GROUND-VISUAL
6. COURSE: SE
7. PHOTOS: NO
8. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NO
9. CONCLUSION: POSSIBLE (AIRCRAFT)
10. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observers sighted a pattern of yellow lights similar to those of an airplane, but the lights did not blink off and on, and the noise could not be heard because of the noise from a jet in the area. Surface winds at San Luis Obispo at 2020 hrs. were calm. Several vantage points from land and sea were taken, but the objects were not seen as air balloons before and didn't think that a hot air balloon caused the sighting. There were several large aircraft quite near the observer and several aerial advertisers operate in the area. It is quite possible that the observation was the result of one of the numerous aircraft that operate in the area. Probably one of the observers' attention.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

My daughter and I were driving into the country and noticed an object hovering over the ground. It appeared to be round and metallic in color. We watched it for several minutes and it slowly drifted away. The wind at the time was calm.

There is no photograph present in this document. The image shows a questionnaire form titled "SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE" with various questions and sections for the observer to fill out, including a sketch of an observed object and its position in the sky.

AFR 80-17(C1)
SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE

- page 3 -

This page from the Project Blue Book document contains two images. The primary image is a compass-like diagram with a person standing at the center, surrounded by directional labels. The text states that this diagram should be used to indicate the direction of the observed phenomenon when it was first seen.

The second set of images shows two similar landscape scenes, one with a person standing in the center, and the other with a split view. The text states that these images are "not applicable - it was directly overhead, and did not occur with the observer."

Transcribing the text from the document:

AFR 80-17(C)
SA: NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "Y" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

Mother followed a light last night to see if I could find it again. First it was small and distant, then as I got closer it seemed to grow larger, brighter and more distinct. When I got within 50 feet of it, it suddenly shot straight up, disappearing from sight in a few seconds. I was not able to make out any definite shape or form, it was just a bright light. When it took off, the light seemed to cover about 10 feet in height in less than a second. The light did not appear to be connected to or supported by any physical object.

The image contains 3 sketches. The upper sketch is a compass rose with instructions on how to use it to indicate the direction of a UFO sighting. The lower left sketch depicts a person standing on a road with a hilly landscape in the background. The lower right sketch shows a similar landscape, but with a person standing on a raised platform or structure.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS NOSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A '+' ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IF THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A '+' AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "X" AND '+' WITH A LINE TO INDICATE THE APPARENT MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN THE FIRST AND LAST SIGHTING. THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON WAS STRAIGHT, CURVED OR IRREGULAR. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THIS SECTION.

The object was a light color shape that extended below and above the horizon. It had a bright center like flash in the middle which made it seem to expand in size and then contract. There were faint areas on the edges of the light that seemed to flare out from the main body. The light appeared to be pulsing and the flares from the edges were faint. The motion was similar to rising and floating smoke or a 'meatball' going up and down with variations in brightness within the overall shape. The sighting lasted for several minutes.

ALSO DESCRIBE ANY OTHER OBJECTS THAT ATTRACTED YOUR ATTENTION IN THE AREA AT THE TIME AND WHAT YOU SAW.
Looked like amazing figures on the skyline from my backyard in San Luis Obispo, California. The objects were very clear and distinct and appeared to be triangular or V-shaped. The motion was very smooth and the objects would occasionally stop and hover, then continue on. The objects appeared metallic and were definitely not conventional aircraft or anything I had seen before. The size was difficult to estimate but they seemed quite large, perhaps 50-100 feet in diameter. The color was a silver/metallic hue. There was no sound associated with the objects.
