AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER 
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO

PROJECT NUMBER: 13073
TRAVEL ORDER NUMBER: 001303
SUBJECT: (U) Trip to Cincinnati Area to Obtain Specimens Allegedly from "Flying Saucers"

A. PURPOSE:
1. The purpose of this trip was to obtain specimens, statements and other related UFO information from Mr. [REDACTED], Cincinnati, Ohio.

B. FACTUAL DATA:
2. Mr. [REDACTED] is a private UFO organization, a self-appointed society for the investigation, research and analysis of "flying saucers".
3. He is also the publisher of (2) UFO publications having fairly wide circulation: "The Civilian Research of Interplanetary Flying Objects".
4. His case files disclose that in 1952 he purposely placed both Colonel O'Mara, then Deputy ATIC, and the Air Force in an embarrassing position by distributing statements which claimed that the Air Force had given him a private interview. 
5. As of late, he has repeatedly attempted to obtain official interviews and briefings from both ATIC and Headquarters USAF on various operational, policy and liaison activities. The claim that he has appointed a "Flying Saucer Investigator" by some Air Force officer in the past.
6. On 11 October 1956, Mr. [REDACTED] contacted ATIC again for the purpose stated in the preceding paragraph. He was told with some firmness that he could only discuss UFO incidents and that responding over the phone on other matters, he would have to contact the USAF Office of Information Services.
7. When it was stated that he had two (2) specimens he believed originated from "flying saucers", this office was then placed in a position whereby it could not refuse the investigation of this individual's case file and disclose what the specimens or matter was in nature.

C. DISCUSSION:
3. Travel commenced on 12 October 1956 and ended 12 October 1956.
4. Lt Col Oliver P. Hill, USAF, Aerial Phenomena Group, AFOPR-454, was the individual making the travel, as investigator.

G. DISCUSSION (Cont.):
10. Names of individuals visited:
a. Mr. 
b. Mrs. 

11. Investigator's personal report:
a. Departed Wright-Patterson AF Base, 0600 hours, 12 October 1956 enroute to Cincinnati, Ohio. Arrived Cincinnati, Ohio 0900 hours. The interviev with Mr. was deliberately delayed for investigative purposes.
b. Mrs.  lives in the suburbs of Cincinnati, in what is known as Madisonville. This suburb is approximately 2% miles from the downtown area of Cincinnati. Mr.  was somewhat perturbed at the delay of my arrival. This was exactly the way this investigation was planned.
c. A note of explanation is necessary here. Mr.  allegedly held in his possession a substance called "Angel's-hair" which propagates of flying saucers. This substance is reportedly floating in the air at times, and is sometimes collected. To insure this substance would not (supposedly) abruptly vanish within a few hours, leaving no trace or residue, it was necessary that my examination would be delayed so that this investigator, which could be considered as hastily treated or prepared to dissolve after the specimen was given me. I let the investigation proceed normally, and the specimen would dissolve before physical examination.
d. I invited Mr.  (and my witness) into his home, and immediately started the discussion by asking if he was free to talk in front of my witness and my business was to inspect his evidence and discuss same for Air Force because he had once been a member of an Air Force Intelligence section.
e. As this investigation involved no classified items or information, I told him to proceed openly. I quote: "How do I report findings to ATIC who pays for this case-ATIC or APRO who pays for the investigation?" I explained I was sent by ATIC to investigate the reported flying saucer sightings, and to get all up-sightings to ADC through Lockbourne Air Force Base and that they paid all phone bills for him.
f. At this point, I interrupted him and explained AFR 200-2 on the procedures of reporting and the conditions under which ATIC authorized the payment of phone calls.

g. I then asked Mr.  who had appointed him "UFO investigator" for the Cincinnati area. And who told this individual was who authorized the aforementioned phone calls, he named a Captain Hugh McKenzie at Lockbourne AF Base, and a Captain Roger who now have replaced Capt. McKenzie.

C. DISCUSSION (Cont):
asked Mr. _______ of then brought up the subject of my real purpose for being there and discussed the question of the nature of the object. ____ said he had come to the conclusion also far and said if it was opened the "Angel's-hair" would disappear. However, suspect-ed immediately that it would not have destroyed by opening the job and he could see that the object was still intact inside the jar. What he had meant was that if the jar was left opened the "Angel's-hair" would disappear.
I then replaced the lid of the jar as it appeared outside and obtained photographs outside. I took additional pictures of the area. In so doing, I noticed a white object floating in the air and retrieved fragments of what appeared to be cotton or spun glass.
I then returned inside and Mr. ____ gave me the ore or metal samples he had collected, stating that they were dug out of an old stone quarry. (I understood him to say near Cincinnati; however, I have since learned that the samples were found in Huntington, Indiana.)
....
D. CONCLUSIONS:
1. All matters regarding the procurement of the specimens and other statements pertained to the individual's report are accomplished.
2. The undersigned did not engage in, nor forced into, any discussions or the air examinations or personalities approach to the UFO controversy which could be used to the detriment of the participants.
E. RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. None. Return of the analysis and identity of the specimens will dictate the action necessary.

The text in the document is as follows:

15 NOV 1956
Richinetts 27, Ohio
Dear Mr. [redacted],

The material which you submitted to W/Sgt Hill on 12 October 1956 for study and analysis is returned.

A thorough, critical analysis naturally required a certain amount of small destruction of the metal fragments, and some dissipation of the chemical materials.

The results of an analysis of this material which, indirectly or unintentionally, you purpose to be of some extra-terrestrial origin, as in the case of the so-called "angel's-hair" produced from a UFO, is as follows:

a. All material submitted is "man-made" or "man-fabricated."
b. Samples were examined microscopically, chemically and spectrographically.
c. Metal Samples:
All four samples were found to be ferro-chromium and magnesium. The composition obtained for these samples is:
Chromium 67 - 73 percent
Silicon 0.1 - 0.2 percent
Mg as Mn 0.3 - 0.5 percent
Iron Balance

The crystalline structure and non-oxidized condition of these samples point directly to the fact that a high-temperature melt must have been the origin. This can be accounted for by the fact that these samples were almost certainly obtained from a steel mill or steel foundry where chromium-bearing alloys are customarily added to steel melts.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a former United States Air Force program to study unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

a. Textile Sample:
The sample purported to be so-called "angel or hair". It was reportedly a very delicate or fine fibre, white in color, rather evenly distributed in 2-3/4"x4"area. It was given both chemical and microscopic tests and, without doubt, was found to be an industrial product. Subsequent investigation of the origin of this sample in the Materials Branch, did not volatilize.
This is the type of industrial or waste product "lint" that may be encountered by various Government agencies or manufacturing concerns of the type to where this originated. There appears to be no particular significance or importance attached to this material which was other than a normal waste product in manufacturing.
The act which you refer to, of carrying nine pounds of metal a distance of one and one-half miles for deposit in a "fuel pit", must have been the category or "box score" type of reception given this "sample" or material by the investigator. Of course, this could be the result of overzealous or an overactive manufacturing of "cover-up" efforts and so resultantly, constituted a desirable waste of Government time and money and effort.

Sincerely,
T.J. CONNAIR, JR.

Captain O. T. Gregory
A.A.I.C. Resident AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Captain Gregory,

I enjoyed talking with M/Sgt. Oliver Hill during his visit to my home, October 12th. He was indeed patient, understanding and courteous. I regret that he witnessed presentations (at the DASC) which didn't allow me more time to show him the endless material re: UFO's, which I have on file, but perhaps this opportunity will present itself at a later date.

Discussed only briefly my collection of notes, etc., re: "little men" which I prefer to call "monitors" -- and the little creatures contra my do not so far humanoid. When M/Sgt. Hill was here, I could not locate the drawings I made on the occasion. I had hoped to show them and indicate a few interesting made jointly by the witness and myself to furnish all the details gathered during my interviews with the witnesses. I

Of interest to M/Sgt. Hill was the metal specimens I had. I promised him that I would forward any pertinent information concerning the metallic composition because the jumbled notes that follow were concerning copies from numerous letters which described the history and preliminary analysis of the metal.

I first learned of the metal's discovery by phone. The caller was the I who sent me a letter, from which I quote in part: "First, the object was found in an old abandoned mine several years ago. The nearest man-made machinery was some 1500 yards away. The object was noticed because of its brilliance against the normal background of the gravel pit."

Date of a letter from which I am quoting is April 2, 1955. Thus, eight months prior to the above date is August 5, 1954. Location of find near Lafayette, Indiana (NOT CINCINNATI, as I later noticed that Sgt. Hill will continue to quote from my material).

This object is 34" high by 4" long by 23" wide--these are rough figures because of the shape of the object. The object seems to be composed of small pieces of metal fused together by some unknown process, yet it is (not) possible to see any evidence of a joint. The metal has not gain any tarnish or discoloration by using a hack saw. The object was checked by a General Electric metallurgist and he states that it is not a meteor. Also, Dr. who saw anything similar in his experience stated that it can not a meteor."

The image does not contain a photograph. However, it appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with text describing a UFO incident.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The following are quotations from a letter of April 13, 1955.

"On February 13th it seems the incident took place. We were told that one of the students had found an object while mowing the lawn, which he later placed on his desk and examined. Later when he and his roommate were examining the object, it suddenly 'got up from the desk and flew around the room, hitting the ceiling and walls. At this time, one of the boys turned on a voltage meter and found the readings to be quite high--indicating a possible source of radioactive energy.' The object was tested and found to be negative. A voltage meter showed a high conductivity; then, a density check registered 'considerable' which, one of them metal experts was sure is 'much heavier than iron.' One of the boys decided to see if he could break off some larger pieces and it is need what will be to you...look a small piece. The welding shops which were tried to held it, red to white hot, didn't melt and didn't change its shape--just turned dark."

"With the numerous samples of the metal on hand, I decided to take them to the University of Cincinnati. Here detailed analysis of the metal is described in the final analysis on the metallic objects. Dr.___ of the University of Cincinnati phone me and explained the results of a spectrographic analysis that would require a larger chunk, they said they found the following elements:"

"50 to 85% of chromium
a high percentage of iron 
manganese
nickel-cobalt
vanadium"

"'Dr. ________ said that the object could safely be called a solidified chromium ingot' which showed by its fusion with other metals to be man-made. However, he was at a loss to explain how or why it was found in a gravel pit which could not produce such a specimen in a natural state...Concluding the analysis, they were of the opinion that the object seemed petrified by its extreme crystallinity. They tested with Geiger Counter at this point they made a comparison test with other metals on hand. Most others showed a higher point of radioactivity than this particular object. In the metallic results it showed a some what lower saturation of radioactivity. All of the analysis was quite negative. The object was subjected to extreme heat, but said the object cooled slowly--thus causing the high degree of crystallinity."

"The following is a quotation from a letter of May 16, 1955: 'This evening, my mother-in-law, Mrs.______, called me from Grand Rapids to state that she has made a go-round the gravel pit where the object was found and that she could not find a trace of any similar metal, or any metal at all. She says that it would be foolish for anyone to carry that original nine or ten pound piece far away. It's a real find, she says it is metallic and a half just like I saw it in the file.'"

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image consists entirely of text describing some details about an unknown metal object found in an abandoned gravel pit near Lafayette, Indiana.

Following is quotation from a letter of August 23, 1955:
"We who will be receiving for orbit scientists and nuclear safety engineers, gave the metal to their lab for a checkup. After the analysis, the metal was sent back to you. One small disk was sent for a metallurgical analysis. This was made on August 11,1955."

So as per the text, a metal object was found in an abandoned gravel pit near Lafayette, and it was analyzed by scientists and nuclear safety engineers. The metal was later returned to the sender.
