This page from a Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. As an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

CONDITIONS (CHECK APPROPRIATE BLOCKS)
DAY - NIGHT: NIGHT
VISIBILITY: POOR
CEILING: CLEAR
WIND DIRECTION AND VELOCITY: UNKNOWN
WEATHER: PARTIALLY OBSCURED BY CLOUDS
MOON: BRIGHT MOONLIGHT
STARS: NO MOONLIGHT
OTHER: NONE OF THE ABOVE

THE PHENOMENON: AS I WAS DRIVING ALONG ROUTE 444 IN DAYLIGHT, I NOTICED A SMALL CRAFT HOVERING ABOUT 500 FT. ABOVE THE TREESPS. THIS CRAFT WAS A LEMON SHAPE LARGER THAN ONE CHROMATIC METEOR. IT WAS MAKING A WHINING NOISE AND AS I WATCHED IT, IT SHOT STRAIGHT UP AND DISAPPEARED. THIS HAPPENED IN THE VICINITY OF FAIRBORN, OHIO.

TYPE OF OBSERVATION (CHECK AS MANY AS APPROPRIATE)
ROUND OR OBLONG
BRIGHT MOONLIGHT
MOON HIDDEN BY CLOUDS
VARIABLE SPEED
NO TRAIL
OVERHEAD (NE-SW)
UNKNOWN

CONCLUSION: THE APPARENT OBJECT, INDICATING WHAT IT APPEARED TO BE FROM OBSERVATIONAL DATA, WHETHER IT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN AN AIRCRAFT, SATELLITE, BALLOON, METEOR, ETC. GIVING ANY SPECIFIC FEATURES OR CHARACTERISTICS ON WHICH THE CONCLUSION IS BASED.

TO SHOW A REFLECTION THAT WILL BLOCK OUT THE BLACK OF THE UFO GOING AND COMING AND LEAVE ANY DETAIL SHORT WHICH MAKES ONE WONDER WHAT CAUSE THIS REFLECTION. OUR INVESTIGATION MAKES US BELIEVE IT WAS A REFLECTION FROM A POLISHED PART OF THE CRAFT SURFACE. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THIS CASE? PLEASE ADVISE IF YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS.
