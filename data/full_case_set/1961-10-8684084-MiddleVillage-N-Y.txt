The image does not contain a photograph. Based on the text in the document, it appears to be a report from the UFO Department describing an incident that occurred on October 10th. The report discusses the trajectory of an object, its appearance, and the witness's observations. The text is transcribed below:

UFO Department

On October 10th at 11:15 P.M. I saw what might have been a shooting star burning out or something that might have been an object to outer space. I was at Briarcliff Manor, New York, approximately 27 miles from a position at Perspptan Avenue and Ellin Avenue.

The trajectory was almost horizontal with the earth. This object gave off what appeared to be a blue-green line of light to the horizon and the ground was illuminated for a considerable way.

Distance is undetermined but relative to a high course it would be incomprehensible, on a flat trajectory a distance of July four or five miles - but only for a brief period of time. 

At first it was as a bright as a star, but moved very fast, then a light formed a spherical shape for a considerable time, and then disappeared.

Burn out location relative to my position was approximately at 2 o'clock.
