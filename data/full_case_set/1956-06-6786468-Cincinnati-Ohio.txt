The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The document is a technical information sheet providing a summary of an observed radar event on June 21, 1956 in Cincinnati, Ohio.

The text in the document is as follows:

"U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. Your may repeat information that you have already given on this statement, or sketches they may have made. Items, statements, or sketches that they consider are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

NAME: [Redacted]
SIGNATURE: [Redacted]
DATE: August 10, 1955

On the morning of June 21st., at 0636, two meteorologists and an electronics engineer were watching the radar scope to observe clouds moving in from the west. An echo appeared at 065 degrees, with the center of the reflective cloud on the 20 mile range ring. The brightness of the echo was the same as that of the ground clutter. On the second sweep of the scanner(6 sec.) the center of the reflective echo had moved about 4 to 5 miles. The first echo still retained much of its brightness. The second echo was due north east of the first. By the time the scanner made another sweep the sharp echoes had disappeared and for the next few sweeps the area went completely blank.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a disposition form from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The form contains text describing the analysis of a radar UFO report and providing recommendations for future reports involving radar detection of UFOs.

The text in the document is as follows:

DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO. 
SUBJECT: (U) Request for UFO report analysis
TO: APOIN-454 FROM: APOIN-4B1 DATE: 21 AUG 55 COMMENT NO. 1

1. In accordance with established ATIC policies for the analysis of UFO reports, request your review and comments regarding the attached report of a radar UFO. The report will be tentatively placed in an "unidentified" category, pending your written opinions or conclusions.

1 Incl 
USAF Tech Info Sheet 
TO: APOIN-454 FROM: APOIN-4B1 DATE: 6 AUG 55 COMMENT NO 2

1. Based on the information reported, it is the opinion of this office that the signal reported was caused by ground clutter. A variation in the index of refraction in the troposphere, caused the R.F. beam to bend and strike the ground. The phenomenon reported in Sweep three is not caused by changes in the index of refraction.

2. In future reports involving radar detection of UFO's, it is requested that the radar be identified, if possible, and the target size seen on the radar indicator.

The image shows a hand-drawn sketch of an object in the sky above the horizon. The sketch depicts an object that appears to be some kind of aerial vehicle or unidentified flying object (UFO). The object has a curved, crescent-shaped form with protrusions or rays emanating from it. The text instructions ask the viewer to imagine that the object was first seen high above the horizon (skyline) and then place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it, and then place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.
