SOUTH AFRICA
A pilot's sighting
This incident, briefly reported in
our previous issue, can now be more
fully documented. Captain R. H.
Miller, a pilot of South African Airways, whose report appeared in the
AFRICAN Journal of Science and his letter
appeared in the March, 1964, issue
of Flying Saucer Review, was flying a Boeing 707 from Las
Palmas to Zürich on the 15th February, 1964, when he noticed a bright bluish-
white glow in the Eastern sky at 06.11
GMT. When observed through the
front panel of the aircraft, the glow
seemed to be about 8 in. in diameter
and was perfectly spherical.
The aircraft was at an altitude of
35,000 ft., heading 033° T.
"I pointed it out to my co-pilot and myself
included the crew, and we all watched the glow for about 10
minutes. During this time it did not
appear to change its position in
relation to the aircraft, which was in
its vicinity, or in relation to the aircraft. I recorded the azimuth and
altitude and estimated the distance
to be about 10 to 15 miles and the
object motionless and stationary."
This was done at 06.25
GMT which would be 08.25 and
GOT 5 respectively.
"Prevailing meteorological conditions were a layer of about 15,000 ft. immediately below the aircraft. This layer
became broken towards the African
coast and the N.E. There was also
some cirrostratus and wisps of cirrus
to the N.E. The air temperature was
about -35°C."
"From the height at which we were
flying, the Eastern sky was lighter, the
lighter being prior to sunrise, and the glow
began to assume an elliptical shape
with the long axis horizontal. The
position of the glow was now shifting
in relation to stars and the aircraft,
and we observed its attitude as changing
slowly, but its size appeared to diminish."
"As the Eastern sky became brighter, the glow appeared to increase in
size, becoming more diffuse and
the now larger ellipse diffusing and
sparkling oval and finally disappearing
just before the sun appeared above
the horizon."
"From first observation the glow
appeared in space, but the later
fairly rapid change in position in
relation to the aircraft indicated that
it was not."
"At the time, I should be most interested
to hear any explanation of the
phenomenon."

Mysterious Light 
Haunts Couple

There seems to be at least two kinds
of aerial maneuvering lights—one completely inexplicable from a physical
point of view, and the small maneuvering lights, possibly remote-controlled "objects".

We deal with the former in
this account:

John Horan, 21, a headmaster and
his wife, Diane, 19, have reported their
experiences with a glowing "ghostly" light which appeared mysteriously
in the bedroom of their home in Rabual.
The details are set out in an interview with a reporter for the Evening Post of Auckland, New Zealand. Mr. Horan said that the
light shone through their bedroom
car headlights to have shone through a window. He checked and found no way
the light could have entered.
Mrs. Horan said that the light, "a
globe of light without any center", shone
at intervals in their room between the
hours of 11 p.m. and 4:30 a.m. on 6 February 1964. Mrs. Horan said she felt a
"strange presence" in the room, then
opened her eyes and there was the globe
of light. She looked around and instead of one door, there were two doors.
She looked around and instead of one
door way from the room onto the veranda,
she saw what appeared to be three
doors. She screamed, jumped from the
bed and woke her husband who was
sleeping in another bed a few feet
away. Horan said he woke limited and
his husband stood on end, "I was very frightened for a moment in the face of the
thing," he said.

We present the above mentioned articles and later comments. In answer to
various requests from various members to try to delineate between the
physical and physical airborne light
phenomena.

The image does not contain any photographs. It is a page from an old UFO report document that appears to describe an incident known as the "Kent Mystery" that occurred in England on February 20. The text provides details about the incident, including that three people informed the police that they had seen an animal on the road, and that the police later reported seeing a large animal lying across the road. The text also mentions that some people speculated that the incident may have had some connection with UFO sightings.

Text OCR output:

Kent Mystery
Attempts continue to appear
In England. On February 20 the
London Daily Telegraph and many
other newspapers reported that a
story had appeared to be large in
the Cromer area. Three people had informed the police
that they had seen an animal on a
road near Cromer, East Ruam.
Thirty police from the
area were employed in the search and
the police reported to television for
further information as they were
unable to identify the animal seen.
Descriptions which included a tiger, a
puma, a lion and a cheetah.
Because two of the people had
seen strange and evasive animals
may have some connection with flying
saucers may the to refer to the South
African occurrence reported on page
15. However, it was pointed out that
first indications the two motorists
received were the appearance of a
large animal lying across the road.
This was seen followed by the appearance
of a saucer which made several
dives at the car. Could it be that
these animals are related by UFOS
and living conditions? If so, the
picture would fit the cat could be
planted as a diversion intended to
distract the observers. This would be
important to the saucer pilots. It
must be remembered that our first
sighting indicates animals were down
first.

Object Sinks Yacht

The yacht, "Kattie D" - a converted Navy search and rescue craft - was struck by an unknown object about 25 miles off the rugged coast of Cape Mendocino, California, on Wednesday, 5 February, 1964. The yacht sank after a collision, killing 4 crewmen, the Captain and a German shepherd puppy. We are including this incident because it correlates with the official and unofficial sightings of UFO in the ocean in recent years.

The text on the page describes a sighting of a "silvery UFO" that was seen in North Carolina on February 7. The object is described as being approximately twice the size of a B-52 bomber and having a dull silvery appearance. It gave off an intense mirror-like reflection and was followed by a smaller object. No other visual details are provided in the text.

SILVERY UFO INVADES NORTH CAROLINA 
Albemarle, North Carolina, February 7
Joe L. Surles, Ted Bowen, and George H. Cook were witness to a gigantic silvery object at 5:04 P.M., which first appeared in the northwest. 
The UFO was described as being approximately twice the size of a B-52. Its end portions were dull in silvery color. The object gave off an intense light, similar to the intensity of a mirror. A smaller object came into view following the disappearance of the larger craft. 
No details have yet been secured concerning the first UFO's smaller brethren.

Dundee UPO
The following letters are taken from
the Dundee Courier on February 18,20,
respectively. They are as follows:
" "Dear Sir, -About two weeks ago I
observed what appeared to be a
British object in the sky over the
Sidlaws, moving slowly westwards
towards Perth. At first I thought this
might be a satellite, but it took much
longer than 10 or 15 minutes to cross
the sky and lost height gradually. On
the two subsequent occasions when I
observed this phenomenon, on January
26 and January 31, February 10, it
exhibited similar characteristics, accompanied by a pulsing reddish light."
"This is certainly a very puzzling
this phenomenon.
"On each occasion only one such
light was visible of a reddish nature.
They appear at about 6.20 p. m. and
stay visible for periods of between two
and four minutes, then slowly fade.
The only positive deduction I can
make of it is that they may some connection with the American satellite seen
lately over Dundee. Does anyone else
know of this? If so kindly let me have
all the height and speed data.
I cannot say whether this is correct
or not."
"Can a more plausible explanation
be suggested?-Yours faithfully,
"WLSIR."
This letter brought the following reply:
" Puzzled." I refer to Mr. J. S. Dowd's
letter in Thursday's (February 6)
Courier. Like him, I too observed a
strange reddish object traveling very
fast, towards the west.
However, unlike " Puzzled," I do
not think this object was an American
satellite since, when the first Russian
satellite was launched, I could often
see its light through the heavens and
this object was in my view similar. I
would therefore conclude that this
object, which appeared to be a falling star or
some such other natural happening, -
Yours faithfully,
"JOHN OGILVY."

Another mystery hole 
The Southampton Southern Evening News of February 12 add another to the list of mysterious craters or disposal experts are to examine - a mysterious crater which has suddenly appeared in a ploughed field at Blackstead, near Stanbridge. They formed a short cut across the field from the work last night, saw a depression in the ground and they reported the matter to the police.
Police officers from Ampfield, and Winchester, with Mr. David Eustis, reported to the spot. They probed the crater for an hour before they could find its bottom. They came to the opinion that the depression was caused by a wartime bomb—there were many dropped in the vicinity which exploded deep down in the ground.
The center of the cavity is on Hursley Chalk Farm, and examining Mr. Butler's farm buildings at the west side, while the bomb theory seemed to be the most likely theory, there was the possibility that the Romans occupation of the area centuries ago (credit to Miss V. R. West).
