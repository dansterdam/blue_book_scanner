Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your aerial observation on the night of October 27, 1965, was probably caused by the planet Venus which was in the process of setting at the time of your sighting. Venus had a right ascension of 17 hours and 12 minutes and a stellar magnitude of -4.5. This placed the planet at or near the horizon at 8:30.

I am enclosing a report on Project Blue Book, the Air Force program for the investigation of unidentified flying objects. You will note that convincing physical evidence is known to exist which would indicate that UFOs are interplanetary vehicles.

The Air Force Museum is open to the public Monday through Friday from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM and Saturday and Sunday from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Sincerely,

Gentlemen:

I wish to report the sighting of a flying object which my Dad and I made on the night of 10-28-65.
It appeared in the southeast at about 7:25 p.m. EDT. It seemed to move north a small distance and then north again, hovering then disappearing completely from the naked eye, and was orange in color. The object appeared to move north a small distance and then north again, hovering then disappearing completely from the naked eye.

Please advise dates & time your maximum is open to the public. Is it true that you have unidentified flying objects? If so, give these objects available for viewing? I am inclosing a self-addressed stamped envelope. Thank you.

1. Reference the attached report of an unidentified flying object sighting. His observation on the night of 27 October 1965 was probably caused by the planet Venus which was in the process of setting. Venus had a high ascension of 3.9+ hours and 12 minutes and a stellar magnitude of -3.9. This disclosed the planet at 240 degrees azimuth.

2. The Air Force Museum is open to the public Monday through Friday from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Saturday and Sunday from 1 P.M. to 5 P.M.

3. The attached brochure will help explain the objectives and results of Project Blue Book to date. No physical evidence is known to exist which supports the contention that unidentified flying objects exist as interplanetary vehicles.
