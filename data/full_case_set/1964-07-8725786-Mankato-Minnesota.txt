Dear Sir:

I am a student at Mankato State College in Mankato, Minnesota, and I am studying a course in astronomy. I was excited to hear the letter from your office to obtain information concerning the sighting of an unidentified flying object which occurred on the night of Saturday, July 10, at approximately 11:27 p.m. (Central Daylight Time).

Through the following considerable delay caused by passing from one agency to another, I was finally able to obtain the information that this sighting could not be passed to you correctly through the normal chain of events. I was advised to ask your advice on this site conservation in that there was no knowledge obtainable as to the source of the stated object.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]

REPLY TO EDISON
SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING, 10 JUL 64, MANKATO, MINNESOTA

1. Ref your SAFOI PD (File CDS-22) ACBM-69.

Reference the attached letter from Major Jared, USAF, which observed the unidentified object on 10 Jul 64. The following is a suggested reply:

Your interest in having this case investigated by the Air Force for reply. The satellite-like object observed on 10 Jul 64 at approximately 2230Z hours was eventually identified as a re-entry of space debris from a previous satellite or missile. It is noted that the magnitude and general configuration of the object as observed was larger than other objects of known identity. This condition is frequently encountered and gives rise to misidentification, particularly at night.

We regret that we cannot offer a more concrete explanation.

Dear Mr. [redacted],

1954 was a very unusual year in the annals of UFO sighting history. On July 12, 1954, your letter was received indicating your observation of a strange object on July 10, 1954. This satellite-like object you observed was certainly a most unusual sighting, and I regret to say it has defied a completely satisfactory explanation. The object was apparently a very high-flying airborne vehicle, but its exact nature and origin remains a matter for speculation.

We are continuing our efforts to obtain a more complete explanation. Sincerely,

MASON M. JACOBS
