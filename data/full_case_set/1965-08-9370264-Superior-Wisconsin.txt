There is no photograph present in this document. However, the document appears to be an official Project 10073 record containing details about a reported UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 23 August 65 24/0250Z
2. LOCATION: Superior, Wisconsin
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: One Hour
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: Est (?)
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: Possible Astro (STAR/PLANET) Elevation at a greater distance missing, azimuth at observation point not covered description indicating this only. It is believed a natural star.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: One object with no round it. Color green, no trail, exhaust or sound. Initial sighting to north, disappeared over the horizon. Total time to loss reported. In sight for one hour. Investigation officials regard the most likely cause to be a star. Direction rising - Flight to east can be explained if azimuth not started. For clue to identification, not possible as an astral body is small or not present at the direction reported to travel north. Possible error in direction, size will be evaluated as an Astro Observation in view of the investigating official record subject to change if form 14 is returned by witness.

INTELLIGENCE/THIS PARTICULAR OBSERVATION OCCURRED DURING THE
PERIOD OF MY REPORT, DUBIN 0089. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS PERSON
SAW THE SAME OBJECT AS COVERED IN THE OTHER REPORT. HOWEVER THE
PAGE 4 OF RUCODU 9 UNCLAS
OBJECT APPARENT MOVEMENT TO THE EAST WOULD TEND TO RULE THIS OUT.
THE COLOR OF RED AND GREEN BEING EMITTED BY THE OBJECT CAN POSSIBLY
BE EXPLAINED THAT THE OBSERVER WAS ONLY SEEING THE RED AND GREEN
PORTIONS OF THE COLOR SPECTRUM DUE TO IMMEDIATE LOCAL DUST CONDITIONS
OR LIGHT REFRACTION OCCURING AROUND THE OBJECT. IN THE PAST, I HAVE
NOTED THAT STARS OCCASIONALLY SEEM TO EMIT GREEN AND RED LIGHT.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OBJECT SEEN WAS A SATELLITE BUT MOST PROBABLY
A STAR.
