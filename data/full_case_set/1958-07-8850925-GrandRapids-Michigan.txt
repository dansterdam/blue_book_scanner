MEMORANDUM FOR: Captain Matson - AFCIN-4B3B

SUBJECT: General Orbital-Track Checks for Air Sciences Division.

This office has received a number of UFO reports from GOC posts in The Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Minnesota areas. A cursory check discloses that these are primarily sightings by high school students now on vacation and elder people in that area. Their reliability is obvious. However, would appreciate if a check for detailed file could be made on the following observed in that area:

a. Time: Between 2120 to 2140 hours (local).
b. Date: 12 July 1958.
c. General direction: SSW to ENE.
d. UFO appearance: Very small, white and round.

Just received UFO report from Air Attache, France - there were four military observers. Basic data:

a. Place: NE France (50 N - 4 E).
b. Time: 2127 Z (GMT for that area considered O. Therefore, local time same as GMT).
c. Date: 11 July 1958.
d. General direction: 130 - 190 degrees to 4,050 degrees estimate. i.e. generally SW to NE.
e. Appearance: Round, white. In sight approximately one minute.

Your comments and results of your computations may be hand written on this memorandum. Would appreciate it if you could give us a call.

Captain, USAF

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, featuring two sections of text describing sightings.

Comment re sighting No. 1:
Date: 13/0220' - 0240 July
Place: 85 W. 4500' (toward the North and West also)
Case: At 0240 Z on 13 July 1958 Af (Sputnik III rocket) was over Lake Huron at 135 miles altitude.
(Instrumental observation point of 45 degrees N - 90 degrees West the satellite (1958 Af) per Sputnik III data. Its orbit was about 115 miles. The satellite was maneuvered to the west of the rocket and still transmitting much in the visibility.)

Comment re sighting No. 2:
Date: 11 July 1958
Time: 2127 Z
Place: NE France (50 N & E)
1958 Af (cracker) have been in the vicinity of the sighting area at 2117 Z on 11 July at an altitude of 165 miles traveling in a direction of 25 degrees.
