b. Description of Course:
  (1) Time - object sighted: Approximately 13:02 to 13:07 March 1959 to give her husband medicine. As she was returning she saw the object approximately 50-75 yards south, when the object appeared at the left or eastern edge of her bedroom window.
  (2) Area of Observation: The observer stated that when first seen the object was about 1.5 above the horizon, and her description indicates it maintained this elevation and position without noticeable change in altitude or direction of flight.
  (3) Angle of elevation and azimuth: when first seen:
    Elevation: 5° - 10° 
    Azimuth: 230° - 240° above the horizon and

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
1. SIGHTING (DATA)
a. Location, date, and comments of observing officer:
(1) Rudolph H. Pestalozzi, Captain, USAF, 8317th Air Division Intelligence Officer.
(2) Comments:
Captain Pestalozzi had heard of unidentified flying objects and knew vaguely that the Air Force had investigated in the past. However, he had not seen anything that could be identified as such an object and was absolutely certain that the object observed on this occasion was not an airplane and too slow to be that of a meteorite.

b. Description of what was observed:
(1) The object appeared to be a golden light, varying in size. It was traveling at a highly irregular speed, sometimes very slow and at other times speeding up quite rapidly. The light was observed by herself and others for about 1 1/2 hours.
(2) The object seemed to be reacting in her effort to report it. It would slow down and almost stop when she would reach for a pencil and paper to make notes, and would speed up again when she desisted.
(3) Upon close examination, her eyes were normal.
(4) There were no other reports of UFOs at or near the time of this observation.

c. Personnel in the control tower reported no unusual activity in the air traffic in their system for about two hours before or three hours after the sighting.
d. The tower personnel reported no astronomical or meteorological phenomena that accounts for this sighting.
e. Mrs. Pestalozzi appeared to be a lucid, honest person. She firmly believes that what she observed was an unidentified aerial phenomenon.
f. There is no evidence, pro or con, other than Mrs. Pestalozzi's word to substantiate this report.
g. Existence of physical evidence: none.
