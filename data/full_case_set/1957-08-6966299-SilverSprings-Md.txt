DATE 15 August 1957

15 August 1957 7;27 PM EDT My wife and I were eating at next door neighbor's house and were called out by the children to observe a star in the sky. We saw a V shaped string of separate blue white luminous objects moving thru the bright blue sky. At first I thought it might be a group of parachute jumpers but I could see blue sky was visible between each of the seven luminous bodies. The formation moved at a steady rate toward almost due North from a point overhead. We called all the neighbors out, one of which had a pair of binoculars. I viewed the formation thru the binoculars and there did not appear to be anything additional. I did check the size of the "V" which due to my point of a cliff cast against the sky had to be at beginning sight and able to be observed after sighting in.

Williams, T/Sgt.

In discussions with Col. [REDACTED] of the Bio-Physics lab- regarding,
this source (who has sent in UFO reports) before 23 Feb 1954, Col. [REDACTED]
believed that source was not of good reliability. Reasons:

1. How could one estimate a distance of 100,000 feet at night?

2. Particularly, if the sky is cloudy or hazy?

3. Even a B-36 would hardly be seen at that altitude for the past [REDACTED]

4. How did he arrive at a speed of 1200 MPH + under those elements.

5. His duration (about 5 minutes) contra-
dicts the figures done. Consider him a 
Unreliable Source:

See U.S. GOC Guide — A B-36 (even in broad daylight) 

would look like a 1/4" star at only 5 1/2 (5) miles =

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?
Faded from view as form of light at least 1000 yds in the horizontal away

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
I calculated the size, distance, and speed of the objects. On the traingle objects reconstructed the formation with scotch tape and seven polished dimes. I mounted the construction at an angle in the sunlight to get the bright, glowing effect and backed off until I reached a distance of about 3 feet. At this reconstruction simulated very well the original sighting when the sun was reflecting off moving, highly polished surface of the figures for altitude of not 10,000 feet away approximately 4-5000 mph.
