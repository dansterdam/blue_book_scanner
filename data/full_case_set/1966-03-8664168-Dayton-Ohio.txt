TEXT OUTPUT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
66-26
PAGE 1 OF 1
DATE OF REPORT 14 June 1966

SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION PERTH, AUSTRALIA
DATE Unknown

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF IR QUALITY

1. PURPOSE: This report is in response to Work Order Number 66-49 presented by Major R. Quinlivan, TDEW/UFO, which requests an analysis of two prints and two slides of a Perth, Australia 1966 sighting to determine the identity of the unidentified image.

2. ANALYSIS: The analysis was completed jointly by Photo Processing (TDPP) and Photo Interpretation.

3. A positive identification or description of the UFO is not possible with the photography analysis (TDPP) and photo interpretation comments which may prove relevant to the analysis.

a. The image does not appear to be the result of any processing effect.
b. The apparent size of the objects used seems constant and the stated 2 second exposure time was controlled, as indicated by their precise definition. The distance covered by the vehicles during the time of exposure, as indicated by the trail lengths, is much less than the objects would occupy if visible for the stated 2 second exposure time. Speed calculations in excess of 1,000 MPH would be indicated by a second exposure time. Speed calculations to determine an even more extreme speed could not be made, as the information on the size of the objects and the distance from the camera were not contained in the original request.
c. The shape, brightness, and color of the bright image are about the same as stated, and the reflections of the streetlights are quite similar to 25 feet above the water. The reflections of the streetlights are quite similar to the possible observation that could have been made from the vantage point of reflection from the image.

6. The measurements are possible due to the relation of the bright image.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

The photos inclosed belong to Life and were lent to one of our people by one of their for a personal favor with this stipulation - we must return them quickly.

At the same time, we are still committed to Congress to analyze these photos.

Would you make copies, return the originals (which are really copies of the originals) as quickly as possible, and use your copies for your analysis.

Hopefully, Miss's theories, published lately, can explain these photos?
