REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
DATE: September 6, 1959
LOCATION: Wallingford, Kentucky
OBSERVER: Private First Class Gene Snyder, U.S. Army

On the evening of September 6, 1959, at approximately 8:15 PM, Private First Class Gene Snyder, U.S. Army, was on routine patrol near the town of Wallingford, Kentucky. While crossing an open field, he noticed a bright light in the sky approximately 1/2 mile to the northwest. The light appeared to be hovering and pulsating. 

Snyder stopped and observed the light for several minutes. It then began to slowly move in a northwesterly direction. As it moved, the light appeared to increase in size and brightness. 

Snyder continued to observe the object until it disappeared from view behind some trees. He immediately reported the incident to his commanding officer.

This report was filed as part of Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects.

Text from the document:

This case was previously reported and investigated as being concerned with the sighting of a spherical object. The information contained herein is a supplementary report to that investigation.

On 5 August 1959, Captain D.W. Atcomb, USAF, Public Information Officer at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, forwarded a letter to this Headquarters which had been received from Mr. T.F. Werner, Box 1, Wallingford, Kentucky. The letter from Mr. Werner stated that he had been contacted by a newspaper reporter who was interested in publishing a news story on a sighting made in the Wallingford area of Kentucky on 6 July 1959. The letter stated that Mr. Werner did not wish to have this information published and requested that it be filed "in your department for reference".

Captain Atcomb stated in his letter of transmittal that he felt the incident should be investigated further. Accordingly, this Headquarters requested the Detachment Commander, 3206th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron, Dayton, Ohio, to dispatch an investigator to interview Mr. Werner and obtain further details on the incident.

On 1 September 1959, Mr. Richard L Huffman, Detachment Commander, 3206th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron, reported the results of his investigation. He stated that he had interviewed Mr. Werner and obtained the following information:
