The text in the document reads as follows:

February 12, 1964

Dear [redacted],

The Air Force has attempted an evaluation of the incident described in your letter of October 24, 1963, which was recently forwarded to this Headquarters.

Letter and the form 941 enclosed with your letter indicate that on your flight on July 8, 1963, at about 10:25 p.m., you sighted a strange light in the sky. This light, in your letter, you indicate appeared slower than a jet and was triangular in shape and blue-green in color. The distance traveled was less than 150 yards in approximately 2 to 3 minutes.

After a careful evaluation of the information you provided, I am unable to support your contention that the incident was of an extraterrestrial nature. Conflicting data and carries this evaluation.

On the assumption that the information supplied in your letter and the reported time and location are accurate, I am unable to explain satisfactorily the sighting you witnessed. However, it is my opinion that the sighting was probably a natural phenomenon and does not represent evidence of visitation of our airspace by extraterrestrial vehicles.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. I trust my explanation and conclusion conform with your expectations.

Sincerely,

[Redacted]

REPLY TO
UFO Sighting (Near Hampton, New Hampshire)

A. UFO SIGHTING (Mrs Gaiser)
VRAN 22 DCO

1. The following information is provided to assist you in a reply to Mrs. Gaiser's letter.

2. A letter was received from Mrs. Gaiser on 14 October 1963 with several bits of information concerning a UFO sighting which she reported to the Air Force Base at Pease, N.H. on 23 September 1963.

3. In her letter she indicates various inconsistencies in the information that he has provided.

4. An investigation was made of the report and of the possible solutions to the sighting in which the objects were described as being similar to balloons. This is the best explanation which can be offered at this time based on the information provided.

5. In his letter he indicates a speed greater than 600 MPH. In this connection, it is noted that the speed as estimated by the observer was approximately 600 MPH. This speed that she reports would be consistent with the possibility that the objects were aircraft. The objects were observed for only a short time and the distance traveled as estimated by the observer would account for the high speed reported.

6. The sighting has been placed in the "Other (Confirmed Date)" category and carries this evaluation. It is a possible solution based on the information provided.

7. The reported time of the sighting (2107PST) was approximately 2.5 hours.

8. Accepting the above assumptions the case could be evaluated as follows: the initial detection would be consistent with aircraft and the flight path and speed would be consistent with aircraft at that altitude.

THE NEW HAMPTON SCHOOL

Apparently to story concerning a possible UFO sighting made people anxious. It's expressed that there shouldn't be any concern or alarm over the matter, as the school has used the occasion to point out how difficult it is to make accurate observations, even under ideal conditions. The school is taking a sensible approach and not sensationalizing the incident. Please do not consider any report on this matter to be anything other than the school's desire to be completely factual and to avoid any appearance of exaggeration.
