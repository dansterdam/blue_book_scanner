Transcription of the text in the document:

"The thing, moving at a tremendous rate of speed, was sighted over Sierra Vista, Arizona on 7 July 1968. The observer, a science teacher, reported that the object was first sighted at 10:06 PM and observed for approximately 30 seconds. He described the object as metallic, reflecting the light and about the size of a small car. The object was moving at an estimated speed of 1000-3000 mph and traveling in a straight, level direction from the southwest to the northeast. The witness stated that the object's speed and maneuverability were unlike any conventional aircraft he had ever seen. He discounted the possibility of the object being a satellite, meteor, or other natural phenomenon. The observer is considered a reliable source with no history of erratic behavior or questionable mental health issues."

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

A strange and very unusal event took place on 4 aug 1960 about 2115 hours near Sierra Vista Arizona and was reported by a reliable and respectable person who observed this phenomena. The object was about 200 feet in diameter and was dark grey in color and hovering about 75 feet off the ground and was cigar shaped with no lights. It hovered for about 3 - 4 minutes and then took off at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.
