AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 3-11-1952d AT39

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORT: (Contd)

10. In an attempt to secure the opinion of local astronomers, the investigation disclosed that the astronomers of the Baltimore area were unable to offer any information. However the Observatory's astronomers were still on Summer leave. Finally, the Director of the Maryland Academy of Sciences stated that to his knowledge nothing unusual in the way of astronomical behavior had been observed at the time of the phenomenon described. He thought it possible that the lights sighted may have been aircraft.

11. A later check with the Baltimore Filter Center revealed that a Miss Jean Laudlow of the CCG unit in Baltimore had called the Filter Center and reported observing two bright lights east of her post flying toward the north at about 2255, 9 September 1952. She observed the object through binoculars and distinguished what seemed to be pulsating or flashing lights. The object was called until 2302. at which time it faded from sight.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FLIGHT: 2-11-1652-A-1555 
PARTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: PROBABLE
1. The report of the Preparing Officer, the UFOB sighting was probably caused by the blinking night lights from one or more of the Andrews AFB jets flying toward or from the Baltimore-Washington figure on 09/02/52 and 09/03/52 Sept. 25.
2. The sequence of changing lights observed from the Glen Burnie GCA post was lost or red to blue to white to blue to red. These aircraft were known to have been flying in the area at that time of the sighting.
3. None of the evidence collected seems to discredit the possibility that the lights observed were those of aircraft in the vicinity.
(1) The operations reports from the 25th FIS at Andrews AFB established the presence of aircraft in the vicinity.
(2) The Operations Officer, 647th AC & W Squadron confirms the presence of radar targets and the sighting of F-86 aircraft in the area above and to the south and west of Baltimore at the time of the sighting.
(3) The observers did hear sounds of aircraft in the area while they observed the lights, and the sounds were coming from beyond the area illuminated by the lights.
6. The following evidence indicates that the lights observed from the ground might not have been from an unidentified flying object.
(1) That none of the pilots flying in the vicinity of Baltimore on the GTC of the sighting were able to offer any confirmation on the UFOB.
(2) The presence of radar confirmation on the Andrews aircraft and the lack of it with respect to the UFOB.

CAPTAIN
OFFICER IN CHARGE

COMMENTS OF Approving Officer:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was probably caused by the blinking night lights from one or more of the jet aircraft known to be in the vicinity of the sighting.

I. SOURCE: Hurlburt F. Bonnie
Address: 127 Dorchester Road, Glen Burnie, Maryland
Age: 32
Occupation: 1st Lt, USAF, 4760th GCS, Baltimore, Maryland
Education: College
Qualifications: An Air Force officer, alert, intelligent and possessing 20/20 vision.
II. RELIABILITY: Uniform source was contacted by telephone.
III. SOURCE'S DESIRE: SOURCE's desire to remain anonymous was at his residence in Glen Burnie, Maryland, at 0920/7 Sept 55 when he sighted strange lights in the sky which seemed to be maneuvering in a most peculiar and erratic manner at a moderate speed.
He estimated the object(s) to be circular or oval in shape and about 35-45 feet in diameter. The object seemed neither to gain nor lose altitude.
SOURCE recalls that the form or definite body shape was variable at any time during the sighting, although it seemed always to maintain a general circular or oval outline. The object appeared to pulse and there was a constant variation in the intensity of the whitish light which was emitted. This light was very bright and seemed to pulsate or wink in some manner.
The lights observed by SOURCE and his wife, who was essentially the same phenomenon as himself, hovered on successive occasions over the approximate area for a period of 45-60 minutes. At times the lights appeared to shoot out the sides of the undefined object.
SOURCE mentioned that there were some aircraft in the sky throughout the period of the sighting and at times seemed to be blinking lights, but in his opinion, they were coming from aircraft considerably beyond the object.
The Baltimore Filter Center received a call from SOURCE at 0920/25 Sep 55 reporting the observation of an unidentified flying object outside his house and continued observing the UFO, reporting again to the Filter Center at 0930/2 Sept 55 to state that the object had gone out of sight.
According to SOURCE, no photographs were taken of the UFO.

The text from the document is as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 3-H, 4602d ATSG

I. SOURCE: Mr. Albert Merzel
Address: 609 Newfield Road, Glen Burnie, Maryland
Age: 44
Occupation: Line Draftsman for Westinghouse 
Education: Six years schooling at the Maryland Institute of Electrical Drafting
Qualifications: Presently working on Guided Missile Control
Has had 25 years experience in electronics.

II. RELIABILITY: Unknown. SOURCE was contacted by telephone.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At 09/02/307 Sept 55, just after midnight, having been posted on the GCI Lookout station in Glen Burnie, SOURCE noticed a blinking light, flashing phenomenon in the western sky. SOURCE stated this light seemed to be about 5 miles from his station and flying at an estimated altitude of 5,000 feet.
The condition of the sky was clear and the wind was slight. SOURCE's first thought was that this might have been a jet aircraft, but the way it seemed to change in color and maintain a constant altitude, shortly precluded this possibility.
At 09/02/22 SOURCE reported the baffling phenomenon to the Baltimore Filter Center, which followed a westerly course and appeared to be losing altitude, which continued tracking the object.

SOURCE told the investigator that the lights changed color periodically from red to blue to white every few seconds, giving the appearance of a strobe effect.
Aircraft were in the sky at various times throughout the sighting, but SOURCE said their speed seemed to rule out the possibility of its being an aircraft. Occasionally the object would seem to come from the general direction of the USOE directly. However, these aircraft seemed to be much smaller than the UFOB pursued.
SOURCE called in to report that the UFOB had begun to disappear at 09/03/02 Sept 55. No photographs had been taken of the UFOB.
The SOURCE stated that in his opinion, the object was probably a weather balloon. Investigator concluded the interview at this point.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 3-11, 16027 AISS

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORT:

1. The CAA Tower at Harbor Field, Maryland (George GJPK 2315) was called for information on the UFOB. According to the controller on duty, he had noticed nothing unusual in the surrounding sky. In his opinion had any of the pilots sighting had noticed anything unusual in the surrounding sky. In his opinion had any of the pilots sighting reported it to the control tower, a later check with this installation to determine whether any blips or disturbance had been picked up. 

2. A check with the Air Traffic Control Tower at Friendship Field (George GJPK 2312) yielded substantially the same results, usually that they had received no confirmation of any unusual flying object in the vicinity of Baltimore.

3. The Baltimore Filtration Center was found to have been responsible for submission of data on the 3-11-55 case to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Virginia, which prepared the preliminary report. All observers of the object had called in to the Filter Center to report the sighting.

4. Operations, GFRC, were contacted and this installation reported that in addition to the File (21) an F-86 had been airborne in the general area on that date. Permission to continue practice GIC-GCI recoveries was granted and it continued on 07/03/55, practicing GCI-GCI recoveries west and north of the city, and landed again at Andrews AFB at 09/0375.

5. A check with the PIO, Operations at Andrews AFB revealed the following information concerning the flying objects sighted on 3-11-55. That four F-2, and 3 F-86 aircraft were airborne from Andrews AFB, Maryland (George GJPK 2015) on this date. Generally, that from 10:18 to 13:28hours EST on 07/03/55, these pilots were maneuvering in the area east and west of Baltimore while practicing TIS and running intercepts before landing again at Andrews AFB at 14:00 hours. Lens of the pilots from any of these aircraft had reported anything sighting which blinks on and off or show other unusual maneuvers.

6. The US Weather Bureau at Friendship Field was contacted and the officer on duty stated that his station is no longer an Air Force installation and since has no further information on this incident. 

7. The Weather Station at Ft. Meade, Maryland, (George GJPK 1607) was called but insufficient data could be obtained on either the 8th or 9th of September.

8. Contact with the Air Research and Development in Baltimore and Friendship Field revealed that AERO activity in this area is entirely administrative, not operational.

9. The J-750GC OCS in Baltimore, which controls the operation of the Filter Center and the Baltimore APS, reported the activities of its personnel on duty offered the utmost assistance to the ARIS investigator conducting the follow-up investigation.
