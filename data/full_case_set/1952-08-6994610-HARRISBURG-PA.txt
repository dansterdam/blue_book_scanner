UNCLASSIFIED
United States
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title: FLYOEPT)
LOCATION: Middletown Air Material Area, Middletown, Pa.
DATE: 6 AUGUST 1952
OBSERVER: John E. Sharrock, 2d Lt., USAF
NATURE OF INFORMATION: Civilian Observer
AIR FORCE LETTER NO. 200-5, 20 APR 52
REFERENCES: â€”
OBSERVATION: Observed an unidentified flying object in Harrisburg, Pa. at approximately 0100Z.
DETAILS: The observer, an unidentified flying object on 2 August at approximately 0100Z from the third-floor apartment in Harrisburg, Pa. The geographic location of the observer was approximately 760687. The observer was attracted to the object by a brilliant white light in the sky, climbing rapidly at a 500 angle. The object, which was described as disc-shaped, appeared to be approximately 20-25 feet in diameter and was luminous. The observer could see no details of the object's surface. The observer could give no estimate of the altitude or speed of the object, other than that it climbed rapidly and disappeared from view for approximately three to four seconds. The observer could give no further details.
The weather at the time of the observation was approximately ten miles visibility.
The observer appeared to be a man of average intelligence and not excessively imaginative.
It is believed that this report checks closely in time and description with reports submitted by Mr. Sherlock, Pa. Harrisburg is approximately twenty miles east of Harrisburg.
