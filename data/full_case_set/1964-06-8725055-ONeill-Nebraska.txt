The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document or report. I will proceed to transcribe the text from the document as requested.

[Transcription of text:]

Swift object seen
Observed 3:45 pm. 5-31.

Speed 1300 mph and 2000 ft.
Altitude
Material jet black. At first looked like sheet of foil circling slowly then burst of speed to 1000 mph in 3 seconds.
Observed for 9 to 10 seconds.
Compared to jet contrails at 37,000 ft. which looked motionless while this object made an abrupt turn and accelerated rapidly out of sight. Unusual and spectacular observation.
