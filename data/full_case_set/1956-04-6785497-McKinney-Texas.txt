Dear Sir;

Attached hereto is a sketch of an unidentified flying object seen over this city, or apparently over it, on April 4,1956. Efforts have been made to identify the UFO, hence the delay of sending this report.

The UFO was called to my attention, as I am the local Weather Bureau observer, and I noted it at 3:16 P.M. on the afternoon of the date named above. It was apparently ten degrees northwest of zenith from McKinney, and I at first thought it a weather radiosonde balloon. On calling the Fort Worth Weather Bureau however, I learned that there were no weather balloons in the air in this vicinity. I then decided it was far higher than at first I believed, and ran a base of three miles for a triangulation reading. The angles showed little or no convergence, and I ran another base line of the same length. This latter triangulation showed, as far as I could determine with my old prismatic compass, a convergence of about three degrees. This placed the UFO some 100,000 feet up. With an old rifle telescope I took several readings and finally worked the object out as subtending somewhere near a minute of arc, making it over 200 feet in diameter.

An amateur astronomer here placed his 200-power telescope on the UFO and drew a sketch of it for me. I am sending you a copy of this. The astronomer said it apparently was moving westward at about 100 miles per hour, though the upper air currents were blowing toward the east far greater than that. I noted the UFO from 3:16 P.M. until dark. I saw it was in opposition with the planet Venus, which I saw while watching the UFO, and about seven degrees due north of the planet. As the planet traveled westward the UFO kept its station with respect to Venus—seven degrees north. I am inclined to think that what the astronomer, C---, interpreted as movement was the rotation of the earth, turning away from the UFO.

Now, a most peculiar phenomenon connected with the UFO was the fact that it did not rotate all afternoon. The raised band around its middle remained stationary—north and south. There were no appendages attached to the UFO whatsoever. It glistened in the sunlight like silver, though Mr. Anderson said it looked as if it was made of translucent, silvery rubber. I did not observe it through the telescope, only through the 200-power glass. So far as I was able to determine, the UFO did not change its position with respect to the planet Venus at any time, and when it finally disappeared about 9:00 P.M. it was still in relative relation.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from the Project Blue Book UFO investigation program.

The text in the document is as follows:

The UFO was so high that it flared in the sunlight. Long-star-like, it was in sight for about 30 seconds and then it was gone. From about 5 to 6 miles in the southeast sky, the UFO was described as being about 1,000 feet and it was far above them. After seeing it, they claim to have told the Weather Bureau, the Air Force takes at Carswell Base and Perrin Field, and were told that they do not have any information on the UFO-incident. It was gone on the morning of April 5.

So much for that. Now another:

On April 6, two days after the above-mentioned UFO was seen, the same persons were driving five miles east of McKinney in this city, and in companion, when suddenly they saw a large white glowing object. It was too bright to look at directly. They stopped the car and the UFO took off at a terrific speed and disappeared. They remembered a ball-like trail it left behind.

Another: On the night of April 15, nine days after the UFO was sighted over the city, it was seen again looked at through binoculars. It appeared to be hovering over Sterling to the north. I at first took them to be jets, but by the time I realized they were not airplanes but they had already passed from my view. I could not ascertain how far away they were, but I said nothing, save to ask about strange lights over the city at the time and date mentioned before. I shined a light toward him, without leading him to believe I had seen them. Just what they looked like when I saw them, I cannot describe, for they were passing like meteors and their traveling speed was tremendous. He could hear - with the UFO - which originated on. So could estimate their size to be not over two minutes of arc in viewing them from below. They traveled over an estimated two minutes and were gone from below. said they were also about 40 degrees in the estimated two minutes and three degrees of azimuth, or a total of about 60 degrees. I only saw them briefly.

In addition to all this, I would like to state that I am no player in flying saucers, but am submitting this for what it may concern in view of the date you already have on hand concerning UFOs.

Yours sincerely,
Captain U.S.Army, Retd.

Dear Sir:

Attached hereto is a sketch of an unidentified flying object seen
over this city, or apparently over it, on April 4, 1956. Efforts
have been made to identify the UFO, hence the delay of sending
this report.

The UFO was called to my attention, as I am the local weather bureau
observer, and I noted it at 3:15 P.M. on the afternoon of the date
named above. It was apparently ten degrees northwest of zenith
from McKinney, and I at first thought it a weather radiosonde
balloon. On calling the Fort Worth Weather Bureau however, I learned 
that there were no weather balloons in the air in this vicinity. I 
then decided it was far higher than at first I believed, and ran 
a base of three miles for a triangulation reading. The angles 
showed little or no convergence, and I ran another base line of 
the same length. This latter triangulation showed, as far as I could
determine with my old prismatic compass, a convergence of about 
three degrees. This placed the UFO some 100,000 feet up. With 
an old rifle telescope I took several readings and finally worked 
the object out as subtending somewhere near a minute of arc, making 
it over 200 feet in diameter.

An amateur astronomer here placed his 200-power telescope on the UFO
and drew a sketch of it for me. I am sending you a copy of this.
The astronomer said it apparently was moving westward at about 100
miles per hour, though the upper air currents were blowing toward 
the east far greater than that. I noted the UFO from 3:15 - 8:10
dark. I saw it was in opposition with the planet Venus, which I saw 
while watching the UFO, and about seven degrees north of the 
planet. As the planet traveled westward the UFO kept its station
with respect to Venus--seven degrees north. I am inclined to think 
that what the astronomer, █████████████████████████████████ this
city, interpreted as movement was the rotation of the earth, turning
away from the UFO.

Now, a most peculiar phenomenon connected with the UFO was the fact
that it did not rotate all afternoon. The raised band around its
middle remained stationary--north and south. There were no appendages
attached to the UFO whatever. It glistened in the sunlight like
silver, though Mr. ████ said it looked as if it was made
translucent, silvery rubber. I did not observe it through the tel-
escope, only through a four-power glass. So far as I was able to
determine, the UFO did not change its position with respect to the 
planet Venus at any time, and when it finally disappeared, about 
9:00 P.M., it was in the same relative position.

The UFO was so high that it glowed in the sunlight long after dark on the earth's surface. There were some cirrus clouds in the upper air about 7:00 P.M. and I was far above them. I had ascertained their height to be 11,000 feet. My rough calculations may have been far off, of course, and I think they possibly were. I am inclined to belive the UFO was at least 100 miles high, as I have talked to observers as far west as 100 miles and north 50, and all them say it appeared overhead to them.

I have contacted the Weather Bureau, the Air Force bases at Carswell Base and Perrin Field and all of them say they do not have any information on the UFO--don't know what it was. It was gone on the morning of April 5.

So much for that. Now another:

On April 5, two days after the above-mentioned UFO was seen, While Mr. Carl Johnson night editor of the hern at, this city, and a companion were driving five miles east of lckinney they saw a silvery object, five to eight feet in diameter, stand down in a field 100 yards from them. They stopped the car and the UFO took off at a terrific speed and disappeared. They thought it resembled a balloon.

Another: On the night of April 13, nine days after the UFO was sighted over the city, I was at Mr. Grant facing's house looking at stars with him through his telescope. Starting to leave at 9:15 P.M I saw two red lights shoot low over the house tops to the south. I at first took them to be jets, but by that time I realized they could not possibly be, we bay'd already met' West. I could not ascertain how far away they were, so said nothing, save to ask Anderson if he had seen them or heard and planes. He had not. A few days later a local man called me, Mr. James Mintner, caled and asked if I had seen any strange lights over the city at the time and date named above. I asked him, without leading him to believe I had seen them, just what they looked like and their direction, He said they were pale blue and traveling west overhead. He said there were three of them, and they made no sound so far as he could hear. With the UFOs triangulated on, I could estimate their height and speed. They were about 150 feet above the ground and as they traveled over an are of ebout 40 degrees in the estimated two seconds that I observed them they were making somewhere in the vicinity of 1,800 m.p.h. Mr. Mintner, viewing them from below said there were three of the, and the giowed pale blue. I only saw two and they were red.

In addition to all this, I would like to state that I am no believer in flying saucers but am submitting this for what it may be worth in view of the data you already have on hand concerning UFOs.

Yours sincerely,

Captain U.S. Army, Retd.
