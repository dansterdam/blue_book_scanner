Text from the document:

To Whom It May Concern:
Last evening on the car radio I heard an unidentified flying object which hovered over a Portuguese aircraft and caused the aircraft to descend close, I believe, to the ground. This occurred some time before. While listening to the conclusion of the more interesting reports with others and myself spotted in the skies on the night of Tuesday, July 6, in the area who might have seen the same object, but as far as I could detect no one else did, either.
It was a little after 11:30 in the slightly cloudy at that time and my mother then noted a very bright object in the skies which it was difficult for bank into a landing at the airpost in Pittsburghg... . After a short time the object again stopped and this time came back to the East. It started acting up again, moving along for some distance, but we unable to emit anything from the object. It passed silently to the South and was behind a hill behind some trees, so I had to climb the garage roof and attempt to keep the object in view, but was unfortunately to lose sight of it. It then moved off in the direction of the road to track it further. When a friend came by and asked me what and when conditions we the street, I told him and then moving back to the south. A police car came back and reported the object. Shortly before it appeared behind the house. 
It pays off no sound, and it had a very at first appeared yellowish in the distance... It must have the lights were very bright and must have been quite low in interference in seeing the object. Planes that crossed over and their motors were recognizable far off in the distance.
More than likely you get many such measure you what over we saw that particular evening was a of reflection or even balloon and moved along steadily with some going before we spotted the brilliant lights. I also have a notion to state you of this additional information. Between the nature of these objects since there are believe in the unusual sightings occurring in two or three of the local towns.

Thank you for reading this letter.  I remain,
