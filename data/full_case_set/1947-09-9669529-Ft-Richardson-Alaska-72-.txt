The comments are that it is known that no important scientist active
from Germany before ending in Spain, and those mentioned in this article
are not known to them.

3. If possible, therefore, an effort should be made to obtain names,
qualifications, or any information that might help to identify the alleged
German scientists working in Spain.

4. A brief statement was made in a recent intelligence report from

This close range sighting reported should render a more detailed observation
than what was reported, which also suggests a follow-up.

5. It is further requested that this office be advised as to progress
being made on the plotting of all Flying disc incidents to date, particularly
in North America. It was understood that Lt. Carroll was going to
plan the incidents, but no further word was received regarding this ef-

The image appears to be a scanned page from a document, but there is no photograph present. The text on the document is not clearly visible due to poor image quality, and as such, I'm unable to provide an accurate transcription of the entire content. However, I will attempt to transcribe as much as I can decipher:

"...office or up to the time..."
"...that there was..."
"...near..."
"...the lights at..."
"...approximately..."
"...I couldn't..."

Due to the quality of the image, the text is largely illegible, and only fragments of words or partial lines can be made out. To obtain a complete and accurate transcription, a better-quality image or the original document would be required.
