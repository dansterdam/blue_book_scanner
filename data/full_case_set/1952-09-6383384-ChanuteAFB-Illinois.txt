Air Intelligence Information Report

FROM (Agency)
"Intelligence Section
Chanute AFB, Illinois

REPORT NO. 
PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

		On 17 September 1952, lst Lt Alan B. HOGAN, AO 245198, 1918-3 AACS,
	Chanute ATB, Illinois, aircraft controller, rated pilot who is not on flying
	status, with 850 flying hours and 65 combat missions in Martin B-26G, was
	interviewed in his office and stated in substance:
	
		Lt HOGAN along with two airmen was on ditly in the CHANUTE AFB control
		tower on the evening of 16 September 1952. All three men noticed an
		unusually bright bluishwhite light, approximately ten (10) times the
		diameter of the neighboring stars, in the sky at approximately 15 degrees
		above the horizon and approximately 50 degrees compass heading.
		During the period of observation, 2210 hrs to 2235 hrs CDT, the
		object moved in a straight path from the aforementioned position to
		approximately 20 degrees above the horizon and 35 degrees compass heading.
		It then ascended to approximately 60 degrees above the horizon and to a
		90 degree compass heading and disappeared as if going behind a cloud.
		During the ascent the object disappeared three (3) times for a period
		of several minutes each time. On its re-appearance the object was always
		5-6 times as bright as it appeared to be later. From 2225 hrs CDT the
		object, although continued to be brilliant, had lost its power and brilliance
		to 1/3 of its‘ former contour. Through the binoculars the
		object appeared to be an irregular round mass with two (2) small
		satellites. One satellite was to the object‘s left and slightly above
		center, the other was to the right and slightly below center. During
		the period of observation the satellites did not change their relative
		position to the main body. There was no apparent sound, oscillation or
		fluttering motion.
		
		The weather consisted of thunder storms in the west behind the observers
		and light cirrous clouds in the east. It was definitely noted that on
		several occasions clouds passed between the object and the observers.

		A local flying B-25 was requested to attempt interception of the
		subjet. The B-25, although oxygened, was confined to an altitude of not
		more than 10,000 feet. The pilot of the B-25 never saw the object
		clearly at any time and dismissed it as being a reflection of a star
		on the clouds.

		The other two control tower operators agreed substantially upon
		the appearance and course of the object with Lt HOGAN.
