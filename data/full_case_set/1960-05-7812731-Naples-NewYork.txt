The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the left shows a curved line in the sky with an object above the horizon, indicating the observer's perception of how high the object was in the sky. The smaller sketch on the right shows a person standing on a road with some buildings and a hilly landscape in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Places an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" on the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position where you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)
In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. To present the details of the observation more clearly, additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.
NAME: [REDACTED]
(DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE)
CODE: [REDACTED]
SIGNATURE: [REDACTED]
DATE: 24 MAY 1960
The handwritten text describes an observation of a picture window "looking down (about 3-4 mile high) at something just behind the mountains from time about 11:50 PM to 1:00 AM PST. Object, judged to be a rather large object, seemed to be hovering with a pulsating oscillating light occasionally going out about 8-10 seconds then coming back on at once. Object hovered and moved in a peculiar manner and finally went off out of sight. From [REDACTED] to P.S.D.E.N. checked the same through telescope and spotted the object, but could not make out details because of night haze. Whatever it is or was, it was high, motionless at times, and pulsating like a bright object. It seemed to be a solid object and not a mere light or reflection. Possible, tough, that such a plastic, iridescent sphere could be an off and on pulsating reflection from the moon on the window.

The text in the document is as follows:

We are aware, and think seriously, about the possibility of the existence of the universe by our enemies in other history. There was a rumor in the report about all this, to the purpose of this that, from a recent can again, but the question in the mind of the people, who knows about this whole matter, as the first, on the last. So much be more sacred, to have a check those in our -- where the heavens can be continual Godmen.

We really mean it. The government shall have a post on this skill, or they will nothing the purpose. About to use a portion of our dead to discuss purposes. But in August, we are remarkable enough to -- or used to. Now there is something that stimulated, and I see and stimlated of these people. Turning them--USA has 5 million alcoholics, but I had to be the only person around here who does Flies can try. I sometimes wonder -- well.

Being about it --- but, this world needs not allow a little peace that matters of which. Certainly, more remarkable than these matters have seen thereto -- perhaps little defined.

PRESIDENT
NEW YORK 1, NEW YORK

27 May 1960

Security Chief 
The Pentagon
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

On Thursday 26 May, while sitting at my picture window at our home in Naples, a very strange thing happened. It was about something like five minutes or there about. 

I noticed about something like a fish-bowl-like a sphere, except that it had a glassy appearance. It came towards our home coming from the west with a sudden motion. Beneath this sphere, there appeared some small disturbances and slight glitterings in the air near the surface of the sphere. This sort of apparition startled me, and I found my field of vision narrowed, as if I looked in vain for the sphere. None was to be further en, perhaps they would not be visible anyway, as they were moving toward the sun.

Soon, a small glow seemed to be moving to my neighborhood (or perhaps its own neighborhood), as a beacon. Within a few moments, the small plane having passed, these glowing things, which I would liken to an orange in size, seemed to dart out of the sky. The wind appeared two sort of flat, shiny things, which dropped into the vine and moved away rapidly in an easterly direction. It was all over in what seemed less than a minute.

I'm really quite disturbed about this. I wonder if there could be any explanation which would enable us all to be on guard on behalf of our country. This I have no other recourse but to report to you the incident, as I witnessed it myself. I have no doubt as to the reality of what I saw. I would be grateful if you could give me any information on this subject.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
