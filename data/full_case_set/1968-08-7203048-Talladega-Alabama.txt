OCR output:

Dear Sir:

On the night of Aug. the 3rd of this year I saw a strange object in the sky. It was about 25 west above the horizon & the sky was clear & bright. The object was moving very fast at a tremendous speed, at first I thought it might be a shooting star, but as I watched it moved across the sky in a rather zig-zag motion and it was larger than any shooting star I have ever seen.

As I watched, it suddenly stopped and remained stationary for a few seconds, then it suddenly took off again in a different direction at an incredibly high speed and was out of sight in a few seconds.

I first got the impression that it was reflecting some light, possibly sunlight, as it seemed to flash and glitter, but I noticed that the sky behind it seemed to be visible through it as it moved, so it was not reflecting light, but rather seemed to be emitting its own light.

I called to my wife, and she too saw the object in the sky and confirmed what I saw. We watched it for several minutes until it disappeared.

I was amazed at the speed and maneuverability of the object and would appreciate any information you could give me about it. Was it some kind of experimental aircraft, or was it something else? I would be very interested to know if anyone else reported seeing this object in the sky that night.

I hope you can give me some information about this sighting. I have not reported it to anyone else, as I did not know who to contact.

Yours truly,
[Illegible signature]

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Witnesses were put up to orbit from what to start. Apparently they had seen some strange things that seemed to thwart them in their chives of huge astronomical objects. To the best of the first hand careful observation at different times of these seesaw activities. On the right of stray 3rd and twin were bright for a long time on the ground or a little plane or a hovered at a very small size of light, and then there would be a size increase until it became such a tremendous size that it was impossible to compare it with any plane or object known to give off that much light. According to the description, it hovered at the stake and made no noise whatever. Suddenly it shot at tremendous speed straight up the star again. No trail. It stayed there quite a while, and then it would redisappear again. This was repeated a number of times during the watch. One witness said he saw it go off the light of star or a moon. The shine went an out of the star or light. It seemed to be a considerable distance away. This was not a reflection of any kind, nor was it an ordinary aircraft. It appeared to be an object of tremendous size that could make itself invisible at will, or at least blend in with the background in such a manner as to be completely obscured from view.

Transcript of the text in the document:

As a matter of historical fact, the Air Force has considered this case well substantiated and typical of the better documented cases in Project Blue Book - most of these cases being of an ambiguous nature and not susceptible to precise evaluation. Many investigators have considered this case to be of major importance as another indication of a genuine unknown phenomenon. The case was closed as unknown at the time it occurred and there is no indication that the nature of the phenomenon has been determined by any subsequent investigation.
