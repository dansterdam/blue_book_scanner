SUBJECT: Goose Bay, Labrador, 12 Feb 56

TO: TDEW/Sgt Moody

The information in this report is too incomplete for an evaluation to be made. It is not logical for a genuine target to "fade" and disappear when the fighter gets close to it, as the normal situation is for the target to get stronger the closer the fighter gets to it.

The information in this report is too incomplete for an evaluation to be made. The case is not logically clear to it and disappears when the fighter pilot closes to it - the normal indication is for the observer to carry the contact to closure for a better evaluation.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report with text on it.

The text in the document states:
