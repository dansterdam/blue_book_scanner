PROJECT BLUE BOOK RECORD
1. DATE-TIME GROUP: 26 FEB 67 - 2251-1102
2. LOCATION: Edinburg, Texas
10. CONCLUSION: Satellite (possible)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observer watched a round, yellowish colored object travel toward the south. The object was about the size of a dime held at arm's length. It moved very slowly and then disappeared rapidly in a southward direction. The description is consistent with that of a satellite observation. Atmospheric conditions could have the distorted the sighting.
