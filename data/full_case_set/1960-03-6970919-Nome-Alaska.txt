Text from the document:

1. SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object.

2. REFERENCE: Report of the Air Force (Project BLUE BOOK)

3. The unidentified object was also reported to the U.S. Coast Guard, and a copy of the Coast Guard report has been forwarded to this headquarters in accordance with AFR 200-2. 

4. With reference to the matter from Mr. ____, this headquarters has determined this attachment for reporting the object sighted does not constitute a report under Project BLUE BOOK at this time.

5. In addition to his letter to Colonel install, Mr. ___ requested that the published identification of this object be forwarded to him. All information concerning this particular sighting will be forwarded in accordance with AFR 200-2.

On 5 March 1960 an additional unidentified object was reported in the Nome, Alaska area. According to the report, the object was white in color and moving at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for 7 to 10 minutes. Ground radar tracked the object, which was confirmed by pilot visual observation. The object appeared to be under intelligent control.

The initial press inquiry on this incident was answered by an Air Force spokesman stating that the object was probably a "natural phenomenon" and that the Air Force had no information indicating the presence of any unidentified flying object in the Nome area.
