STATEMENT

Davis-Monthan AFB
Tucson, Arizona
23 May 1949

On 16 May 1949, at approximately 1700 hours, I was at my barracks, Bldg 1531, Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona. I was lying on a bed looking east through one of the windows on the west side of the building, when I noticed a solid, round, flat black object in the sky which attracted my attention. The object was about the size of a wash tub, and it appeared to be about three to four feet in diameter. The object flew directly over Davis-Monthan AFB and it appeared to be traveling directly from east to west, almost directly in the direction of the sunset. 
Being that it was a cloudy afternoon, I can say that the object that I just described was flying about halfway between the ground and the ceiling of the clouds, which is about 5,000 feet above the surface of the earth. This object was traveling at a speed which I estimate to be about from 800 to 1,000 m.p.h.

I looked at the object for approximately eight to ten seconds before it disappeared from my view behind an aircraft hangar curtain, which is located about three blocks directly west of my barracks. This hangar is building, 1540.

The object maintained approximately the same altitude during the entire period of sighting and it appeared to be fluttering as it disappeared from my view. This object also seemed to be traveling in a predetermined direction. There was absolutely no exhaust in sight or surrounding the object and I never heard any sounds during the time the object was in my sight. This object never came in contact with the clouds which were in the area at the time, and I never noticed any rotation or lights on the object. There were no attachments to the object but it appeared to know where it was going during the entire time it was in my sight.

When I first saw the object, I called it to the attention of some of the men in the barracks but none of them arrived at the window in time to see the object.

It is my belief that the object which I saw on 16 May 1949, is one of the objects which are commonly referred to as "flying saucers".

At the present I am an automobile mechanic (MOS 014) and I work at the Preventive Line Maintenance Shop at Davis-Monthan AFB. I have been interested in any objects pertaining to mechanics for the last three years. I never have seen anything similar to the object which I described above. I am not color-blind, and I have always been able to distinguish one object from another.

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

On 16 May 1949, at approximately 1700 hours, I was at my barracks, Bldg No. 1511, Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona. I was lying on a bed looking West through one of the windows on the West side of the building, when I noticed a solid, round, flat black object in the sky which attracted my attention. The object was about the size of a wash tub, and it appeared to be about three to four feet in diameter. The object flew directly over Davis-Monthan AFB and it appeared to be traveling directly from East to West, almost directly in the direction of the sun. During that, it was a cloufty[likely cloudy] afternoon, I can say that the object that I just described was flying about half way between the ground and the ceiling of the clouds, that is about 500 feet above the surface of the earth. This object was traveling at a speed which I estimate to be about from 300 to 1000 M.P.H.

The look that the object for approximately eight to ten seconds before it disappeared from my view behind an aircraft hangar building which is located about three blocks directly west of my barracks. This hangar is building No. 1510.

The object maintained approximately the same altitude during the entire period of sighting and it appeared to be fluttering as it disappeared from my view. This object also seemed to be traveling in a pre-determined direction. There was absolutely no exhaust in sight or surrounding the object and I never heard any sounds during the time the object was in my sight. This object never came in contact with the clouds which were in the area at the time, and I never noticed any reflections or lights on the object. There were no attachments to the object but it appeared to know where it was going during the entire time it was in my sight.

When I first saw the object, I called it to the attention of some of the men in the barracks but none of them arrived at the window in time to see the object.

It is my belief that the object which I saw on 16 May 1949, is one of the objects which are commonly referred to as "flying discs".

At the present I am an automobile mechanic (MOS 014), and I work at the Preventive Line Maintenance Shop at Davis-Monthan AFB. I have been interested in any objects pertaining to mechanics for the last three years. I never have seen anything similar to the object which I described above. I am not color blind, and I have always been able to distinguish one object from another.

Tucson, Ariz.
23 May 1952

On 16 May 1952, at approximately 1130 hours, I was at my barrack, room #1531, Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona. I looked up in a northwardly direction and one of the fellow airmen in my room drew my attention to an object, which, at that time did not catch my immediate attention. The object was about the size or a bit smaller, than an aircraft and about three to four times as slender. The object then suddenly dart up vertically at a high speed to the traveling overcast... and to the east, southeast suddenly in the direct path of the object. Going into a very cloudy overcast, I could see bits of blue sky which just suggested behind the object and was between the overcast and the ceiling. On two occasions, that it came down across the white surface of the overcast. This object was traveling at a speed which I estimate to be about 700 to 1,000 m.p.h.

The object did not appear to have the general characteristics during the period of sighting and is supposed to be fluttering as it disappeared from my view. The object did not cast in the sky or surrounding the object and it never moved any contrails, no exhaust in the object was in air, sir. This object never was in conjunction with clouds which were in the area at the time and I never received any reflection on it, as on the object.

When I first saw this object, I called it to the attention of some of the men in the barrack but none of them arrived at the window in time to see the object.

The map depicts what appears to be a layout of roads, mountain ranges, and other geographic and infrastructural features around the Tucson area, including the names of roads, mountain ranges, and other landmarks. The two "UNCLASSIFIED" stamps indicate the classification status of the document. It also features annotations such as "Path of Flight" and "MTS" which could relate to the tracks of observed unidentified flying objects, given the context of Project Blue Book, which was a UFO research initiative by the United States Air Force. 

The bottom of the map also has an "EXHIBIT "A"" label which suggests that this map was part of a collection or series of evidential items for a report or investigation.
