REPORT NO. 9749
REPORT BY: CAPT JOHN T HUGHES
ON: 6 AUGUST 1965
(C) INCIDENT:
AT APPROXIMATELY 2230 HOURS ON 22 APRIL 1952, A TRAINEE NAVIGATER IN THE CONTROL TOWER AT WHITEMAN A.F.B., MISSOURI, OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT ON HIS RADARSCOPE. THE OBJECT REMAINED STATIONARY FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 MINUTE, THEN ACCELERATED AT AN EXTREMELY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM THE SCOPE. THE OBJECT WAS ROUND IN SHAPE, WITH A DIAMETER OF APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 12 MILES. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES.

The image appears to show a radar display or similar instrument used for tracking and monitoring objects. The display shows a series of concentric circles, likely indicating distance or altitude measurements, with various markings and labels around the perimeter. There is a distinctive blip or object visible on the display, which may represent a detected object or target.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract the text from the document.

REPORT NO. 6978040
DATE: 2 August 1965
LOCATION: WHITEMAN AFB, MISSOURI
SUMMARY:
1. On 2 August 1965, at approximately 2025 hours, a bright light was observed in the sky by the duty officer (Lt. D) and the duty airman (A1C C) at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. The light was first observed in the northwest and was moving in an easterly direction. It appeared to be approximately 500 to 1000 feet in altitude.
2. The light was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, during which time it appeared to be changing shape, size, and intensity. At one point, the light appeared to split into two separate lights, which then rejoined.
3. The duty officer and airman immediately reported the sighting to the base operations officer, who in turn notified the radar approach control and the commander of the 351st Strategic Missile Wing.
4. Radar approach control was unable to detect any targets in the area corresponding to the reported light. No further investigation was conducted, and the incident was classified as "unidentified."

2. TIME OF OBSERVATION: 1753-1800Z
3. DURATION OF OBSERVATION: 7 minutes
4. LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: Whiteman AFB, Missouri
5. WEATHER CONDITIONS: Clear sky, calm winds
6. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
A bright light was observed through the clouds moving in a circular path in a counter-clockwise direction at a steady rate of speed. The object seemed to have a bright halo-like glow around it. It was observed for about 7 minutes.
7. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
At 1753Z, the Senior Controller in the RAPCON at Whiteman AFB, Missouri, observed a bright light through the clouds moving in a circular path in a counter-clockwise direction. The object seemed to have a bright halo-like glow around it and moved at a steady rate of speed.
The object was tracked on the search radar scope but no primary return could be obtained. The controller then switched to height finder mode and obtained an intermittent return indicating the object was between 15,000 and 20,000 feet in altitude.
The object was observed for about 7 minutes, from 1753Z to 1800Z, when it disappeared from view.
8. IDENTIFICATION AND EVALUATION:
The object could not be positively identified. The radar indications suggested a real target, but no primary return could be obtained. The object did not appear to be an aircraft or other known object.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object, Whiteman AFB, Missouri
1. On 6 August 1965, at approximately 2325 hours, the Whiteman Air Force Base (AFB) security police received a call from a military member stationed at Whiteman AFB who reported sighting an unidentified flying object (UFO).
2. The witness stated that he had been driving his automobile on a perimeter road at the base when he observed a bright light in the sky near the southeast horizon. He stopped his vehicle and observed the object for several minutes. The witness described the object as round, stationary, and hovering approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. He stated the object was illuminated with a bright, bluish-white light which pulsated periodically.
3. The witness contacted the Whiteman AFB security police, who dispatched a patrol car to the area to investigate. The patrol car arrived at the scene within minutes, and the security police officer also observed the unidentified object. The officer stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape, was illuminated with a bright, bluish-white light, and was hovering approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.
4. After observing the object for several minutes, it suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view to the south. The entire incident lasted approximately 10 minutes. A check of the area revealed no other witnesses to the incident.
5. Project Blue Book has been informed of this incident.

AUGUST 6, 1965 
STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN WINSTON M. ANDERSON, RADAR OPERATOR, AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SECTION, 550TH TACTICAL CONTROL SQUADRON, WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, MISSOURI.

ON 6 AUGUST 1965, AT APPROXIMATELY 2200 HOURS, I WAS ON DUTY IN THE RADAR ROOM OF THE AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SECTION, 550TH TACTICAL CONTROL SQUADRON, WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, MISSOURI. WHILE PERFORMING ROUTINE RADAR OPERATIONS, I OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED TARGET ON THE RADAR SCREEN. THE TARGET APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, WITH A DIAMETER OF APPROXIMATELY ONE HALF MILE. THE TARGET MOVED ERRATICALLY AT A SPEED ESTIMATED TO BE IN EXCESS OF 1000 KNOTS.

I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE OFFICER IN CHARGE, CAPTAIN STEPHEN C. GARDNER, WHO ALSO OBSERVED THE UNIDENTIFIED TARGET ON THE RADAR SCREEN. CAPTAIN GARDNER CONCURRED WITH MY OBSERVATIONS AND ORDERED ME TO TRACK THE TARGET AND NOTIFY THE COMMAND POST.

THE UNIDENTIFIED TARGET WAS TRACKED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME IT MADE SEVERAL ABRUPT CHANGES IN DIRECTION AND ALTITUDE. THE TARGET THEN DISAPPEARED FROM THE RADAR SCREEN, APPARENTLY DUE TO A COMPLETE LOSS OF SIGNAL.

I HAVE READ THE ABOVE STATEMENT AND IT IS TRUE AND CORRECT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF.

WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, MISSOURI

1. On the night of 6 August 1965, at approximately 2100 hours, the undersigned and other military personnel were outside the main gate at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, on a security check. 

2. While performing this security check, the undersigned and others observed in the northwest sky an unidentified bright object. This object was circular in shape, larger than a star, and hovering or traveling at a very slow speed. The object appeared to be self-luminous as it emitted its own light. 

3. The object was observed for approximately 45 minutes while it moved about in the northwest sky area. There were no blinking lights or sound emitted from the object. The object suddenly accelerated at a rapid speed and disappeared from sight. 

4. The undersigned reported this incident to the base Operations Center and an investigation was conducted. No satisfactory explanation of this incident has been determined.

Whiteman AFB Missouri 
9749 
65-8-6978040 

This report covers a UFO sighting made by four aircrewmen of the 351st Strategic Missile Wing, Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, on 28 July 1965.  At approximately 2200 hours, the four crewmen, who were on a routine refueling training mission, observed a brilliant reddish-white light in the sky south of their aircraft, at an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet.  This light moved in a northeasterly direction, making abrupt "zig-zag" maneuvers, and accelerated to very high speeds, then hovered briefly, before accelerating again and disappearing from sight.  The crewmen reported that the light was much brighter than the stars, and that its maneuvers were unlike anything they had ever seen.  The object was also tracked on radar at Whiteman AFB. No further information is available at this time.
