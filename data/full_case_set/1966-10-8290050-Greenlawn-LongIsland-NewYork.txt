Observer reported viewing cigar shaped object that had three diamond shaped windows. He had a side view of the object as it was traveling. The object was observed for 2 minutes, then it shot away in a straight path to the east. Contact was made with the witness while Project Blue Book investigators brought him to the Suffolk County AFK. Conversations with the witness indicated that he wanted to be out to get his name in the various news media around the area. The total news media that Suffolk County AFS had told him that Jets had been scrambled to intercept UFOs when asked of this, he finally said that he was told by a friend. The witness has seen several UFOs.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch depicts an object with a disc-like shape and two visible features labeled "Exhaust Trail" and "No visible" parts. The sketch is accompanied by text that describes the observed characteristics of the UFO, such as its sound, color, and angular size.

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? IT SEEMED A COMPLETE DISAPPEARANCE VANISHING ALMOST INSTANTLY AT A FANTASTIC SPEED.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes No. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes No. IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of:
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound LIKE A WHISTLING NOISE 
b. Color ALTERNATING WHITE-RED-BLUE-GREEN
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and measure how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Didn't do it - couldn't observe details how ever it almost meant have covered MOST of it.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The image consists of several text-based questions and diagrams related to reporting and describing UFO sightings.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Text from the document:

On October 9, 1966, at 8:00 PM the night, I was a witness to some strange events at my home in Greenlawn, Long Island, New York.

This evening I was just inside my home, having finished dinner and getting ready to watch television, when I noticed out of the corner of my eyes some strange lights in the sky. At first I thought it might be an aircraft, but the lights were not moving in the way one would expect an airplane to move. The lights were hovering in a stationary position.

As I continued to observe this phenomena, the lights began to move in a very peculiar fashion. They would suddenly dart off in one direction and then abruptly change direction and dart off in another. The movements were almost erratic and with great speed. I called my wife to come and see what I was observing, and she too was astounded at what we were seeing.

The lights were of a glowing nature, not the flashing or blinking lights one would associate with an aircraft. There were three distinct lights, not a single light, and they seemed to be in somewhat of a triangular formation, although not in a perfect triangle.

We continued to observe this for approximately 15 minutes, and during this time the lights continued their strange maneuvers. At one point they seemed to recede into the distance, only to suddenly reappear much closer. It was almost as if they were playing some sort of game, darting about in the sky in a way that defied explanation.

Finally, the lights simply disappeared from view. We waited for some time to see if they would reappear, but they did not. The entire episode had lasted approximately 15 to 20 minutes.

I must confess that I am at a loss to explain what we saw that evening. It was unlike anything I have ever witnessed before, and I can only conclude that we may have seen some type of unidentified flying object. I would be most interested in learning if anyone else in the area may have observed similar phenomena on that date.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in the image. The image shows a handwritten document containing text that appears to be an excerpt from a Project Blue Book UFO report. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

A leg strange thing about this sighting. It seems that in the past few weeks, we have seen - what appears to be - a bright light hovering for period of minutes at a time in the center part of the sky toward the east. This light is not a star, airplane or any other known object. Strange events take place. On Sunday October 30, 1966 at approx. 7:30 P.M. I was sitting watching TV, when another one of the strange lights appeared at a point east of the house. It held its position for about 10 minutes, then proceeded to move slowly in a northerly direction, very rapidly at first, then hovering again at a point north of the house. It continued this pattern for approx 30-40 minutes, when it finally faded from view.
I am absolutely sure this was not an airplane, satellite or any other known object. The object appeared to have a bluish white color, and it did not blink or have any flashing lights as would an aircraft. I have observed the object on 3 or 4 previous occasions, and it always follows the same general pattern. Apparently it is some type of unidentified flying object, or UFO. Please advise.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 14 November 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

If 2 days later, that I had become technician, I felt extreme techness was hot, And my face was reddet about 12 hours. These things that were dark, some becares, into, I submitted is a copy of my narrative meeting on several UFO sightings" ("There 4").

I have tried to give you my complete report of what I saw, hoping to enable you to distinguish and clarify of this most unusual phenomenon. I observed with deep apprecation, I would like to thank you for this opportunity. Please, Therefore, so I might consider what I saw still seeing after strange actities maybe you might not be reluctant to do so, if so I will not be a bit surprised, however always have that question in mind of what that thing could have been.
