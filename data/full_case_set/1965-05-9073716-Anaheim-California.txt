The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing a detailed description of a reported UFO sighting.

On 13 May 65, Dr J Allen Hynek spoke to Mr C G Allen, a California, concerning a sighting on 1 May 65 in Anaheim, California. At the time he was in an Apollo Space Craft. It was one of the strangest things he has ever witnessed. It was brighter than immediate stars.

The object was brilliant brighter than Venus as evening star. It traveled south from 175 degrees North to South, then disappeared very fast at about a 15 to 20 degree angle.

The object was moving, but not erratic. Its motion was brighter than immediate stars and changed in brightness, size, and color. It changed from a brilliant white to a reddish color, then to a bluish color, and finally a greenish color. It then disappeared very fast at about a 15 to 20 degree angle. It would be most difficult to fall out of a roll. It appeared to only be a few 100 yards away and maybe 100 yards long.

Object was in the sky directly overhead at 50 degree elevation. It was 45-50 feet long when first sighted, 17-18 feet wide, cigar shaped, clear white, no trail. As it moved it varied in size, thought maybe it was rotating. Do not recall it going in front of any stars, just about in the middle of the sky. Was not blinking.

He suggested that it might have been a burn out after a reentry. Time was 1012 local. Object looked like it was going to come down. Observer thought perhaps it was going to crash, but it simply disappeared and no sound, no clouds, no distortion at all, other than it got smaller and smaller.

Object was about gone in 5 or 6 seconds. Impression of going up and away, only because object faded, no sound, no trail, no distortion, no satellite motion. The only unusual thing was the definite change in the size and shape of the object.

The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The text on the page appears to be a letter describing an electronic engineer's sighting of an unknown object with several details about its appearance, speed, and maneuverability.

The text is as follows:

Dear Sirs:

I am an electronic engineer presently employed with North A. in Downey, California. I am working on Project Apollo and am very familiar with the propulsion of large ballistic missiles. I have seen many firings of large ballistic missiles and I have seen satellite devices and instruments. 

On November 7, 1965, while hunting in a remote area in New Mexico, Chula Vista, California, I observed what appeared to be four ballistic missiles in flight. The speed of this object was incredibley fast and I have never seen the likes of it. The details are as follows:

Time of sighting: 2215 local time May 7 th, 1965. 
Position of object at time of sighting: 090 degrees azimuth, 15 degrees elevation.
Source of object: 372 degrees (north 8 degrees east).
Length of sighting: 7-8 minutes.
Color: Brilliant and oscillating in color (white, blue, green and orange).
Shape of object: Seemed to be disc shaped but irregular to be contain.  
Sound: Very slow at first for about three minutes, bu then a high pitched sound similar to keening or whisleing for about 4 minutes.
Speed: Very slow at first, increased to a speed that was up due to the fact that it became difficult to follow with the eyesight. It appeared to climb to the southeast, degrees to 230 degrees in the four minutes.
Sky conditions: 10 scattered at 3,000 feet.

General: I have seen the planets Jupiter and Saturn, and I have no idea of its altitude even though its shape was not like your average aircraft. I have no idea of its altitude even thought its shape was not like your average aircraft. 

I hope this information helps you. It may be an explainable routine thing that is known. But at least it is an intriguing sighting.

Very Respects,
