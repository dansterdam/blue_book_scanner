23 May 1949

SUBJECT: Project "SIGN".

Washington, 25, D.C.
Attn: Director of Intelligence, Requirements Division

1. At 1330 a call was received from the Hanford Area (Concrete)
flying saucer was over the East area approximately 4 (four) 
miles East of the Hanford atomic Plant, Washington. The operator at Han-
ford stated that the Disk was standing still and then took off in a
south-easterly direction at a speed greater than that of a jet fighter.
The available aircraft was called for by the Hanford operator and the
aircraft was scrambled. The Hanford operator cleared the aircraft into
their prohibited area (authorization) coming from the Assistant Chief
of the Security Section at Hanford). The scopes were instructed to
search the southern sector with no results. Crew personnel and the
controller searched the sky, visually, and noted a round, white or
silver object traveling in a northerly direction at a speed greater
than that of jet fighters at approximately 10,000 to 15,000 feet.
The base weather section was then contacted to see if any weather balloons
were sent up and they reported in the negative. Base weather section stated
that they do not utilize weather balloons. At 1420 an F-82, Gertrude 20,
pilot Gardner was airborne and reported in to Torch controller. A target,
number 81, was being tracked in the east-south-east sector by Torch at
this time and the ADCC instructed the controller to intercept it in
hopes that it might be a Disk. Target 81 faded in radar contact just after
(approximately 5 minutes) Gertrude 20 was airborne. The controller was able to
give two vectors before target 81 faded. Radar contact with this fighter was
spotty, so poor that a coherent track on the fighter was impossible.
Approximately 1425 Hanford reported falling bits of paper in their
area (in the vicinity of the Rattlesnake Mountains). The Hanford operator
described the papers as being approximately 6 inches square, red on one
side and green on the other. The fighter was then sent to the vicinity of
the Rattlesnake mountains to examine the area for the papers.

and also to search the Hanford area for other evidences of the Fly-
ing Saucers. The search continued, with spotty radar coverage, with
no results. The Hanford operator again cleared the F-82 into the 
prohibited area and indicated that he, himself, was taking off in an 
airplane to search. He stated further that a weapons carrier had been 
dispatched to the pamphlet (paper) drop area and no papers had been 
found. The fighter was vectored to the Columbia river gorge to lessen 
the time to be flown in the prohibited area. At approximately 1525 
a call was received from the Hanford operator that the papers dropped 
were advertisements for a Rodeo at Richland. The Rodeo is an Air 
Rodeo. The Hanford operator indicated that the pamphlets did fall 
into the prohibited area and were dropped by one of the aircraft 
participating in the Air Rodeo. The aircraft that was dropping the 
pamphlets was a PT-19 flown by Don Wise of the Atomic Speedway in 
Pasco, Washington. This pilot holds a commercial ticket. The air-
craft NC number is (NC 42853). At 1426 the F-82 was cleared to Moses 
Lake tower and landed at 1435.

2. It is believed that two separate and district alert conditions
existed on the afternoon of 21 May 1949. The first was caused by the 
sightings of Flying Saucers (noted) by Hanford using a telescope and 
the operations crew of the 637th AC&W. The second was caused by the 
dropping of leaflets by an aircraft into the Hanford area. It is be-
lieved that there is no coonection between the two events.

3. Teletype sequence of local weather and winds aloft reported 
at time of observation: 5000 feet scattered, visibility 20 miles, 
sea level pressure 15.6, temperature 69, dew point 29, wind SSW 10 
knots per hour, altimeter setting 29.99. Winds aloft: MSL 4000 feet 
240 degrees at 15 knots, 6000 feet, 220 degrees at 15 knots, 9000 feet, 
280 degrees at 20 knots, 10,000 feet 255 degrees at 15 knots, 12,000 
feet 200 degrees at 10 knots, 14,000 feet 222 degrees at 15 knots, 
20,000 feet 190 degrees at 15 knots, 25,000 feet 17 degrees at 20 
knots, 30,000 feet 160 degrees at 30 knots, 35,000 feet 150 degrees 
at 40 knots.

4. Observer states that the altitude (estimated) was between 
17,000 and 20,000 feet. The witnesses name is Max Segoinns, 504 
Failey, Richland, Washington. Segoinns place of work is 200 feet 
meterologist tower.

Broadway in Moses, Washington. This pilot holds a commercial ticket. The aircraft N number is (NC 38256). At 1420 the F-82 was cleared to Moses Lake Tower and landed at 1430.

2. It is believed that two separate and distinct alert conditions existed on the afternoon of 21 May 1949. The first was caused by the sighting of flying saucers (noted) by [Sanford] using a telescope and the operations crew of the 325th. The second was caused by the dropping of leaflets by an aircraft into the Sanford Area. It is believed that there is no connection between the two events.

(UNCLASSIFIED)

At 1330 a call was received from the Hanford Area (Concrete) that a Flying Saucer was over the Hist 200 area approximately four miles east of the Hanford Atomic Plant, Washington, the operator at Hanford stated that the Disk was standing still and then took off in a southeasterly direction at a speed greater than that of a jet fighter. The available aircraft was called for by the Hanford operator and the aircraft was scrambled. The Hanford operator observed the aircraft into their prohibited area (Authorization coming from the Assistant Chief of the Security Section at Hanford). The scopes were instructed to search the southern sector with no results. Crew personnel and the controller searched the sky, visually, and noted a round, white or silvr object traveling in a northeasterly direction at a speed greater than that of a jet fighter; approximately 10,000 to 15,000 feet. The best weather section was then contacted to see if any weather balloons were sent up and they reported in the negative. Base weather section stated that they do not utilize weather balloons. At 12:00 an F-82, Gorge base 201, pilot Gordon was airborne and reported to in Torch controller. A target, number 61, was being tracked in the east-south-east sector by Torch at this time and the ADC instructed the torch to allow the intercept in hopes that it might be a Disk. Turret at radio in radar contact just after it (approximately 5 minutes) Gorge Duke 20 was airborne. The controller was able to give two vectors before target faded. Radar contact with the fighter was spotty, so poor that a corsel check on the fighter was impossible. At approximately 1125 Hanford reported falling bits of paper in their area (in the vicinity of latrines& smokestack). The Hanford operator described the papers as being approximately 6 inches square, red on one side and green on the other. The fighter was then sent to the vicinity of the Rattlesnake mountains to examine the area for the papers, and also to search the Hanford area for other evidences of the Flying Saucers. The search continued, with spotty radar coverage, with no results. The Hanford operator again cleared the F-82 into the prohibited area and indicated that he, himself, was taking off in an airplane to search. It stated further that a weapons carrier had been discovered to the pampalet (paper) drop area and no plane had been found. The fighter was recalled to the Columbia over Gorge 20 as a reason the f-82 had flown in the prohibited area. At approximately 1525 a call was received from the Hanford operator that the AD papers directive were advertisement for a Rodeo at Richlands. The Rodeo is an Air Rodeo. The Hanford operator indicated that the pamplets did fall into the prohibited area and were dropped by one of the aircraft participating in the Air Rodeo. The aircraft that was dropped the pamplets was a PT-19 flown by Don Veele of the Atomic Speedways in Pasco Washington. This pilot holds a commercial ticket. The aircraft NC number is (NC #[REDACTED]). At 1626 the F-82 was cleared to Moses Lake Tower and la

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s),

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:

at 1435.

It is believed that two separate and distinct alert conditions existed on
the afternoon of 21 May 1947. The first was caused by the sightings of Flying
Saucers (noted) by Hanford using a telescope and the operations crew of the
657th AC&W. The second was caused by the dropping of leaflets by an aircraft
into the Hanford area. It is believed that there is no connection between the
two events.
