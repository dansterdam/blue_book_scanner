Observers stated that the object was first seen at about 53Â° above the horizon and then appeared to gain speed, climbing, and then appeared to be going at a speed estimated to be from 1,000 MPH.
12. CONCLUSION Was Balloon Possibly Balloon Probably Balloon Other Insufficient Data for Evaluation Lack of Control and Gain in Speed

The two sources were telephonically interviewed. The opinion of observers was undetermined. Negative results were obtained when this sighting was compared to control plots of jet by observers just before the object was seen. Both SOURCES and lack of control and gain in speed indicate that the object was not an aircraft. Resolved as a POSSIBLE AIRCRAFT.
