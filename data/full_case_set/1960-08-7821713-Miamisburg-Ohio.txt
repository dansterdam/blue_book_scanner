The image contains two sketches but no photograph. 

The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with an object above it. The instructions ask the reader to imagine that they are at the point shown, and to sketch how high the object was above the horizon.

The second sketch contains two images. The larger image shows a road with trees and buildings on either side, with a person standing in the foreground. The smaller image shows a landscape with mountains or hills in the background and a person walking toward the horizon.

OCR Output:
32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. These x's show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.
33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
