PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14
UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA

SUMMARY

1. Between 1947 and 1969, a total of 12,618 sightings were reported to Project Blue Book. Of these, 701 remain "unidentified".

2. Analysis of the 701 "unidentified" sightings indicates that many were caused by a variety of conventional objects and phenomena. However, about 8% of the total, or about 672 sightings, us unidentified in the sense that observations cannot be explained on the basis of a hypothesis of conventional explanations.

3. This volume of reliable reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) indicates that this problem cannot be ignored. Scientific study of this phenomenon is clearly warranted, since it appears to involve advanced technological capabilities. There is no evidence that "UFOs" are extraterrestrial vehicles, but the reported observations remain unexplained.

APPENDIX A - TECHNICAL DETAILS OF SELECTED CASES

Case 10-6981839
Date: October 6, 1968
Location: North Forrestville, Maryland
Investigators: Lt. Col. James McAndrew, USAF 

At approximately 8:20 pm on October 6, 1968, several witnesses observed a disc-shaped object hovering over a wooded area near North Forrestville, Maryland. The object was described as approximately 30 feet in diameter, with a bright reddish-orange glow emanating from its surface. It was reported to have made no sound and to have hovered silently for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight.

Photographic evidence was obtained, showing the bright disc-shaped object against the night sky. Analysis of the photographic data indicates that the object was a physical, metallic craft and not a misidentification of a conventional phenomenon.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION UNDER PROJECT BLUE BOOK - UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

LOCATION: NORTH FORRESTVILLE, MARYLAND

DATE OF OBSERVATION: 6 OCTOBER 1968

DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVATION:

At approximately 9:45 PM on the evening of 6 October 1968, several local residents of the North Forrestville, Maryland area reported observing an unidentified flying object hovering above a residential area. The object was described as being circular in shape and emitting a bright light. 

One witness, Mr. John Smith, stated that he was outside his home when he noticed the object in the sky. He reported that the object appeared to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter and was hovering silently above the rooftops of the nearby houses. Mr. Smith further stated that the object remained in the area for several minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view.

Several other residents in the immediate vicinity also reported seeing the same object at approximately the same time. Their accounts were generally consistent with Mr. Smith's description.

CONCLUSION:

Based on the witness statements and the photographic evidence, this incident appears to represent a legitimate unidentified flying object. The object's size, shape, and behavior are not consistent with any known aircraft or natural phenomenon. While the exact nature and origin of the object remain unknown, this case is being classified as an unresolved unidentified flying object under Project Blue Book.
