PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE-TIME GROUP: August 1963
2. LOCATION: Plainview, New York
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Four
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 Seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: South
8. PHOTOS: [ ] Yes [ X ] No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: [ ] Yes [ X ] No
CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION. Time of day/night not included. If sighting made during night and witness estimation of size is consistent with a close object, that pattern of report suggets BIRDS as the probable cause. Since the report is over 2 years old, it is not feasible to complete an analysis.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed letter from August 8, 1963 addressed to the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Department regarding a sighting of four objects in the sky in the summer of 1963.

U. S. AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.
U. S. D. DEPARTMENT

Dear Sirs:

In the summer of 1963 my friend and I, we saw four bright objects which appeared to be disc-like in shape. They were traveling in a straight south-to-north direction at a considerable speed. As we first saw them, they were in front and north of us; and as we watched them, they shifted positions to the east and next to each other. Then they shifted positions again to the east and in a diagonal line. There were a considerable number of these objects in the specific positions as described.

The objects appeared to be highly reflective, shiny and very large. They seemed to be silent as there was no sound detected. They then appeared to simply disappear from sight.

This sighting occurred on Long Island, New York.

I am writing to you to report this sighting, as I feel it may be of interest to your department.

Very truly yours,
[REDACTED]

Mrs. Hunt/man/SAPOICO/7282a/24 AUG 65
AUG 25 1965

Dear Mrs. Hunt,

Due to the time lapse involved in reporting your aerial observations to the Air Force, it is not possible for us to conduct a meaningful investigation of the sighting.

During the 18 years of investigating UFO reports, we have established a pattern of these sightings and other related phenomena which have not yielded any conclusive evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial visitations to our planet. The attached report on Project Blue Book will provide you with more information on this subject.

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
