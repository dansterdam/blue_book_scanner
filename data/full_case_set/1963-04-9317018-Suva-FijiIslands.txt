EXCERPT FROM THE FIJI TIMES DATA ANALYSIS

MANY PEOPLE SAW FIERY 'SPACE SHIP' OVER FIJI

A Tamavua housewife woke about 3.30 a.m. yesterday and passed a straight through her window into what appeared to be a fiery star 1n the sky. 

Mrs. "almost horrified," it was a frightening experience, she said.

"It was my husband who got out of bed quicker than I," she said.

"I said I had been dreaming, but I insisted that I had actually seen the object."

But about 10 minutes earlier, earlier three "sudden limp" seamen on a merchant ship cruising in the area, had reported seeing something resembling a "flying object" moving rapidly from west to east, with a brilliant illumination.

Members of the RSAF were alerted to the object, and a Lautokaraessage states that reports of strange lights seen in the area have been confirmed, and that about 3.30 a.m. a large object appeared from the southeastern horizon and flew at high speed over Lautoka town.

An officer said that at that time the object was as 1arge as a Jumbo jet, and that it was making a shrill whistling noise. 

The course the object took was out over Natova and then it returned in a north-northwest direction. Its flight was observed for a considerable time by several people in Lautoka.

CONFIDENTIAL
Case No.: 63-2364/35 
Location: Suva, Fiji Islands
Date: April 9, 1963
Investigating Officer: Unknown

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. On April 9, 1963, at 1:25 p.m., a U.S. Air Force KC-135 jet tanker aircraft, flying at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet, was observed by the crew to be "paced" by an unidentified object for a distance of about 250 miles. 

2. The object was described as being approximately the same size as the KC-135, circular in shape, and metallic in appearance. It maintained a constant position relative to the aircraft, approximately 1/2 mile to the left and slightly below the aircraft.

3. After the object had maintained this position for about 25 minutes, it accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from sight. 

4. The crew consisted of the pilot, co-pilot, navigator, and two other crew members. All five crew members observed the object and confirmed the above details.

5. This report has been reviewed by the Commanding Officer of the U.S. Air Force unit involved. He states that the crew members are all experienced and reliable, and that he has no reason to doubt the validity of their observations.

6. The object did not show up on the aircraft's radar, and no other aircraft were in the vicinity at the time. Weather conditions were clear, with unlimited visibility.

7. This report is being forwarded to Project Blue Book for further evaluation and analysis.

Fiji Has A Fireball
On the 3rd of April 1963 Mrs. A. E. Gale, of Suva, Fiji Islands, woke up about 3:30 a.m. and gazed through her window at what appeared to be a moving object in the sky over Suva. It appeared to be moving toward Laucala Bay. She said it was "thunderlike" and 15 minutes earlier three Fijian policemen at Ba had reported seeing a similar object and at 4:30 a.m. a Mrs. W. E. Cook had reported seeing a strange object falling into the sea at Laucala Bay. About 5:30 a.m. the same morning they said they watched a huge fireball fall into the sea which was whitish and made a great deal of noise. The area was bathed in a light as bright as moonlight which seemed to be coming from a falling object. Another witness said the falling object looked to him like the classic example of a Hollywood greenish-white light and had an enormous long fiery orange tail.
