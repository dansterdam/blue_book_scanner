The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon. The sketch shows an elongated, cigar-shaped object with an arrow pointing to it. There is no photograph present in this image.

The text in the document reads:

"IT DOES NOT IMPLY ANY CONCLUSION ABOUT THE VALUE OR AUTHENTICITY OF THE INFORMATION IT IS DESIGNED TO SHOW MERELY THE NATURE OR CHARACTER OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE AND LABEL ANY DETAILS THAT MIGHT HAVE APPEARED AS WINGS OR PROTRUSIONS, AND INDICATE EXHAUST OR VAPOR TRAILS IF SEEN. INDICATE IF AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE OBJECT WAS MOVING."

"A SKETCH SHOULD BE AS ACCURATE A LIKENESS AS POSSIBLE, HOLD A MATCH AT ARMS LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LIGHT. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE MATCH. HOW IS THE MATCH RELATED TO THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE OBJECT? THIS RATIO WILL GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON."

The handwritten text at the bottom of the page states: "the detail is hazy and it is difficult to determine what the object was."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely a report from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects.

Transcribed text:

The weather conditions of approximately 12:30 p.m. was clear and I was in good health. The distance from where I was to where I saw the object was approximately 1/2 mile. The size of the object was approximately equal to a half dollar at arm's length. The shape of the object was round or circular. The color of the object was white or silver. The object moved in a straight line and then disappeared from sight. It was not making any noise. I saw the object for approximately 10 seconds. I feel the sighting was very real and I am quite sure of what I saw.

MEMO FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 22 Sep 69

1. On 22 Sep 69, the Aerial Phenomena Office received a telephone call from a citizen reporting a UFO observation in the sky over Cleveland, Ohio, altitude 1500-2000 feet, at a 7:50 angle. The observer saw the object for 1-1/2 minutes. The object came towards her but then turned and flew off into the east. The sky was clear; the object was a silvery-white color, and was almost circular in shape. This is a summarized version of the report.

2. The observer stated she is a frequent observer of strange flying objects. She has seen them with her at all times so she is quite certain that what she observed was an unidentified flying object. She usually reports these objects when she sees them, but she didn't report this one until now because she didn't want to be confused with a person who sees strange things all the time. Nonetheless, she felt it was her duty to report this sighting.

3. (Name redacted) stated that she saw another UFO about 2 weeks ago, but she didn't report it. She asked for the number to which she could report any future sightings, and was given the information.
