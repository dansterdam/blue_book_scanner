The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document titled "JOINT MESSAGEFORM - CONTINUATION SHEET" with text discussing various observations and reports related to an unidentified flying object (UFO) incident.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

7. Did trackers report incident immediately when it happened or after film developed?
8. Were any observations of incident reported from ships at sea? If so, please furnish details, including ship locations.
9. Any hard facts or evidence to support "possible explanations" reached in part III of referenced message.
PART II: The following comments are offered regarding the possibility reached: (1) that this was an IRBM. The timing coincidence coupled with the U.S. countdown, the geometric relationship, and the estimated characteristics of Soviet ICBM/IRBM propulsion systems strongly argue against this possibility. (2) That this was an ABM. Able: This would have to be water-borne and this is unlikely in this time period considering the present Soviet land-based capability. The technique of interception during ballistic missile launch and check-out xxxxx is not believed under development. Charley: The best estimates of a Soviet ABM capability are in the 63-64 time period. This would mean that the Soviets have a 3-5 year lead on the best estimated capability, presuming such a weapon is being field-tested under the described conditions. Regarding the other three possibilities, they may not be derived on the basis of data available here, therefore we do not consider comments appropriate.

LIGHT SOURCE EMANATING FROM THE IONIZATION CLOUD OF THE ATLAS-C MISSILE AND FLY AT HIGH SPEED APPROXIMATELY 25 DEGREES. (D) MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS POSITIVELY INDICATE THE GREAT IMPROBABILITY OF OBSERVING AN AIRCRAFT AT OR BELOW ANY NORMAL JET AIRCRAFT ALTITUDE SINCE THESE CALCULATIONS SHOW THAT AN AIRCRAFT AT 35,000 FT WOULD HAVE TO BE GOING ONLY 112 MPH IN ORDER TO CROSS THE TELESCOPIC FIELD IN SLIGHTLY UNDER 4 SECONDS AND AN AIRCRAFT AT LOWER ALTITUDE WOULD OF NECESSITY BE GOING PROPORTIONATELY SLOWER. AN AIRCRAFT OPERATING IN THE NORMAL SPEED RANGES OF JET AIRCRAFT WOULD BE FLYING WELL ABOVE THE OPERATING ALTITUDES OF ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT IN ORDER TO HAVE BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED AS THIS OCCURRENCE. REF PART II OF YOUR MSG IT IS BELIEVED LOGICAL TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF A SUBMARINE LAUNCHED BALLISTIC MISSILE.

UNCLASSIFIED
TIME OF THE SIGHTING WAS COINCIDENT WITH THAT OF THE STAR.
PART TWO. THE CONCLUSION THAT THE SIGHTING WAS A STAR IS FURTHER SUBSTANTIATED BY THE FOLLOWING FACTS. THE OBJECT WAS IN THE FIELD OF THE TRACKING UNIT APPROXIMATELY FOUR SECONDS. MOVING GENERALLY VERTICAL. THE DIMENSION OF THE FIELD IN THIS DIRECTION WAS APPROXIMATELY 1/4" AND THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF THE TELESCOPE IN THE VERTICAL PLANE AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING WAS APPROXIMATELY .02" PER SECOND. A RELATIVE STATIONARY OBJECT WOULD THEN REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY 4 SECONDS TO PASS THROUGH THE FIELD. THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF THE TRACKING TELESCOPE IN THE HORIZONTAL PLANE WAS NEGLIGIBLE.
PART THREE. THE PROBABLE REASON WHY THIS PHENOMENA WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED BY MANY PERSONNEL IS DUE TO THE IMPROBABILITY OF IT OCCURRING. FOR THIS PHENOMENA TO TAKE PLACE THE TRACKING UNIT MUST HAVE A LOW ANGULAR RATE DURING THE PERIOD THE 1/16 SQUARE DEGREE FIELD OF VIEW IS COINCIDENT WITH A STAR. THE PROBABILITY OF THESE EVENTS OCCURRING SIMULTANEOUSLY IS SUBSTANTIATED BY THE FACTS THAT THE DENSITY OF STARS WHICH CAN BE VIEWED WITH THE 60 TRACKING TELESCOPE IS WELL BELOW ONE PER 1/16 SQUARE DEGREE AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LOCATION OF THE LAUNCHING PAD AND THE TRACKING STATION PLUS MISSILE VELOCITIES USUALLY REQUIRES TRACKING EQUIPMENT TO OPERATE AT HIGH ANGULAR RATES.

REF CNO MSC DATED 12 OCT 61, DTG 201442Z SUBJ UFO EVALUATION. THE PTD
EVALUATION OF THE CAPE CANAVERAL UFO SIGHTING WHICH OCCURRED ON
7 SEP 61 DURING THE TESTING OF A TITAN MISSILE IS AS FOLLOWS:

PART ONE. BASED ON FACT THAT "BOOGIE" IMAGE WAS SEEN ONLY BY BU
CAMERA AT PATRICK AFB AND NOT BY SENSORS AT OTHER TRACKING SITES, IT
IS CONCLUDED THAT "BOOGIE" WAS NOT, IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO
TITAN. PART TWO. CALCULATIONS BASED ON MISSILE POSITION AT BURN OUT,
THE TIME WHEN "BOOGIE" APPEARED, INDICATES THAT THE IMAGE IS VERY PROBABLY THAT OF A SMALL METALLIC GAMMA FLASHING IN SURFACE OF THIS
ANALYSIS ARE ASFDE FILMS USING THE SAME TYPE OF EQUIPMENT WHICH SHOW
STAR TRACKS SIMILAR TO THAT OBSERVED IN THE TITAN FILM. PART THREE.
THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL DATA HAS BEEN REVIEWED ACCORDING TO CONFIRM
THE EVALUATION:
A. COMPLETE MISSILE TRAJECTORY DATA AS CONTAINED IN
"DATA REDUCTION REPORTS" PREPARED BY RCA/AMC. ACCURATE GEOGRAPHIC
POSITION, ALTITUDE AND VELOCITY DATA INDICATE THAT THERE IS NO
CORRELATION BETWEEN THE MISSILE AND THE "BOOGIE" IMAGE.
