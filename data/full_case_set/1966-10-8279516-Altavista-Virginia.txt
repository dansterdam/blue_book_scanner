INVESTIGATORS REPORT

On 10 Oct 1966, the Wing Command Post at Langley A.F.Base received a phone call from Mrs. *****. (phone number redacted) of Virginia. "About 2030 on the last three weekends, all at night, most recent at 2000 on 2 Oct 1966, what prior to 2030 on 10 Sept 1966, an unidentified object was observed over Altavista Virginia, jet aircraft was observed flying too fast for subsonic flight. Never any sound detected. Never to thousand feet, reversals direction without maneuver required of airplanes. Once, color of light was red. On several occasions lights were between clouds, disappeared, and descended at incredible sublime nearly landing."

I called Mrs. ***** home on 11 Oct 1966. Mrs. ***** was not home but I talked to her daughter Mrs. *****. (address redacted). Mrs. ***** also saw a U.F.O. on the 9th of October 1966. This is Mrs. *****'s statement: "On the night in question, between 2030 and 2100 an object described as the size of a basketball held at arms length, glowed in tones of blue, and it moved extremely fast. It seemed to move from the east to the west, made 2 sharp turns, then "disappeared" (her word) object. Object flew to the west, made 2 sharp turns, then "disappeared" (her word) object. She also stated she had seen other U.F.O.'s at other times."

I called Mrs. ***** again on 12 Oct 1966. I talked to her and she said that on the night in question she is aged 43 years, she has 2 children, and her husband is active in civic affairs. She seemed quite normal and her statement was in considerable detail.

On the night in question, Mrs. ***** saw three U.F.O.'s in a row one after the other. The first was fairly close to the same path, the third was very different. They were all as bright as the bright- the star. They were very motionless, seemed to be in a stationary position. They flew part to be in the Lynchburg Virginia airspace. She stated she can recognize various types of aircraft on sight, and these were not aircraft she is accustomed to sightings of U.F.O.'s, and she can give the contours and the size of each one. On the night in question we both hung up, and within minutes she has called me back to give me more info. Usually within a few seconds of this occurring. A U.F.O. would be observed by her. She said the observations provided the first clue to the presence of U.F.O.'s in the area. She said the little streaks were the same kind that appeared unusual during motion, and she could not identify the distant illumination on a night of excellent visibility.
