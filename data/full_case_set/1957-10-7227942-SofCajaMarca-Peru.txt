The following is extracted from an original report written by an Airman observer in the vicinity of and contains observations of an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of Caja de Marca, Peru, on 10/26/57: 

First I saw an object white-steel-gleaming on October 26th, '57, at approximately 2200-2230G at Caja Marca, Peru. The object was visible for more than 30 minutes, at times appearing to move at a fast rate of speed. 

As I watched, the object seemed to be slowly climbing or descending, and it appeared to be elongated in shape. The direction of the object's motion was toward the southwest. At times it appeared to be pulsating or flashing. 

Azimuth angle; 104.3 ° and Elevation angle: 30.3° 
On 10/27/57 the object was at a higher elevation angle of 119°. Azimuth angle and Elevation angle: direction not exactly eastward. Object appeared to be moving slowly to approximately 30° - 35°. On this date the gleaming object was visible from 1800 to 1939 approximately 1 hour and 39 minutes. It was observed by the automatic "Zeta" recording theodolite. 

Time - GMT - Azimuth - Elevation - Visibility 
1234 - 171.3 - 123.3 - 6/8 - clouds 
1241 - 172.4 - 123.7 - 6/8

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this scanned image. The image shows a handwritten document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book, containing detailed textual information about an observed incident.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Memo to: Capt. Hale
Dir. of Intell., USAF
Oct 25, 1957

1. This case was reported and plotted by the undersigned (S/Sgt. James DeVane).

2. The following represents the details:

a. Witness - ground observation - 2 non-commissioned officers, U.S. Air Force.
b. Type of sighting - a white, luminous, spherical object.
c. Time of sighting - approx. 25-30 minutes, first observed at 2330 hrs, last seen at 2355 hrs.
d. Height, speed, direction - object hovered, then moved in a straight line, first descending, then climbing - speed approx. 700-800 mph.

Conclusions:
a. The object's flight characteristics indicated that the object was under intelligent control.
b. Gathering of radar data that the object would have been picked up, but no radar track was obtained.
c. Variation in flight pattern and speed indicated the object was under intelligent control and was not a natural phenomenon.

ASTRONOMY

Venus Most Prominent

Venus, it is again the evening star, will be at its brightest and most prominent in the sky and will soon be joined by the brilliant object in the sky of "shooting stars".

By JAMES STOKLEY

THAT brilliantly shining object in the evening sky is the planet Venus, now at its best for observation this year.

Venus has been known since ancient times, of course, as one of the brightest objects in the sky. But this year it is especially prominent, far outshining every other celestial body, except the moon.

This is because the planet is in a particularly favorable position for observation in the evening sky of late 1957. It reaches greatest elongation, or greatest angular distance from the sun, on Dec. 7, and until that time it will be visible for a longer period after sunset than will any other planet.

Shining steadily at an apparent magnitude of -4.3, Venus now dominates the evening sky. It can be seen from the time the sun goes down until it in turn sets, some five hours later.
VENUS GROWS BRIGHTER

As 1957 draws to a close, Venus has been gradually drawing closer to the earth, and this increasing proximity has made it appear even brighter. Early in the year, its magnitude was only -3.9, but by now it has brightened to -4.3. This means it appears about 2 1/2 times as bright as it did in January.

This also means that Venus is now bigger in the telescope, and shows a larger, gibbous phase. When it was farther from the earth, its illuminated portion appeared smaller, but as it approached us, this portion has grown larger.

By Dec. 7, Venus will be about 47 million miles from the earth. After that date, it will start to draw away and become less prominent in the evening sky. Throughout November, however, it will dominate the landscape, and will remain a brilliant object until it disappears in the sun's glare early in 1958.

BRIGHT BIRDS IN THE SKY

These maps do, however, show the stars that are visible, and from them you can easily trace out the constellations. Cygnus, the swan, is in the north, with the head represented by the star Deneb. Below it is Aquila, the eagle, with its bright star Altair and two fairly bright companions.

Toward the west, faint Delphinus, the dolphin, can be seen. Above it is the prominent diamond-shaped figure of Pegasus, the winged horse. In the east, brilliant Arcturus glitters as the brightest star of Bootes, the herdsman.

So for stargazers, November brings a veritable "bird show" in the sky. Venus, the brilliant "evening star", dominates everything in sight, but the fainter birds, the stars of Cygnus, Aquila and Delphinus, are also well displayed as added attractions.

This is the 1957 version of what the ancients of old so long ago were watching as they gazed wonderingly at the stars.
