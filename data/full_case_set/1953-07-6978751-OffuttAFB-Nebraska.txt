The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing a radar return that was significantly greater than the main target. The radar target used was 3 square ft aluminum foil. The document provides details about the weather conditions, the speed and movement of the unidentified object, as well as radar data including altitude, azimuth, horizontal slant velocity, and distance out. There is no visual evidence present in this particular page.
