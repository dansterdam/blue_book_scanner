11. COMMENTS
The duration of the UFO sighting was very short, on the radar scope it showed an object zig-zagging which covered several miles before disappearing. The description of lights and a buzzing sound was also reported by observers. However, the conclusions indicate that the sighting was most likely a balloon or aircraft, with insufficient data to fully evaluate the event.
