There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing text describing an emergency alert and civil defense response to alleged UFO sightings.

The text reads as follows:

"Civil Defense on Emergency Alert
Air Force Intelligence officers were investigating reports of "unidentified flying objects" over several states. A Civil Defense spokesman said there was "widespread interest" in the reports, as reports of persons on the ground could see them while in sunlight.

The spokesman at Hamilton Air Force Base said a report from the Salinas Naval Air Station indicated the sighting of some large unidentified flying objects, "going back and forth across the skies in the northern part of the state after bright light was observed."
The Salinas police and Civil Defense authorities warned they were ready for any emergency."

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, containing only text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"The Air Pollution Control and Weather Bureau's Smog Forecast for the King City Area indicates that the visibility is 15 miles due to atmospheric haze and smoke, but otherwise is favorable for visual observations.

The sheriff's office in King City reports that the unidentified flying object first observed at approx 2000 hours tonight suddenly climbed rapidly and proceeded in a northerly direction. The pilot of a small private aircraft in the vicinity at the time also observed the object but was unable to make positive identification. The object was described as appearing silver or metallic in color and to have a flashing red light. Visibility was reduced by haze and smoke at the time and the object was lost from sight after a few minutes. No other information on the activity or origin of the object is available from the report.

The report from the sheriff's office in King City was transmitted to the 18th Air Division of the Air Defense Command of the United States Air Force, which has responsibility for air defense and investigation of unidentified flying objects in the area. The report indicates that no aircraft from any military or civilian source was in the area at the time that could have been responsible for the sighting. The incident is being investigated further by the Air Force."

GREENFIELD, MONTEREY CO., CALIF.

Detailed report of sighting UFO
12-13-62
12:00AM - 8:00AM watch

At 12:30AM 12-14-62, While on routine Police patrol in the City of Greenfield, Calif., Officers CRISP, GALVIN and MARISCAL observed a brilliant light which appeared and stopped immediately, my cruiser to better observe this object, which continued to remain stationary for several minutes. This object, which appeared to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter, gave off a brilliant light in a near circular design, almost solid in appearance, which remained in a fixed position in near cloud sky.

Because radio equipment or power source of this object did not affect in any way the operation of any of my patrols vehicle radio, and was advised that they to were able to locate the same object, the report required that we notify the officers of King City to confirm sighting, other Police units in the area. The officer consulted confirmed (additional details deleted). In continuous observation, this brilliantly glowing object remained in the same position for more than 90 minutes, larger in size than any of other known objects. I observed the Russian "Sputnik" on two orbits over this sighting, however, the movement of this object appeared to be one statical, solid climb off the ground and remained suspended during the entire period of observation. It is the personal opinion of the writer that any report of erratic movement or change of course in light, of any attempt to describe this object as saucer-shaped, disc-shaped, or any other conventional design is unwarranted, as the observation of this glowing, stationary object provides no basis for such a conclusion.

Patrolman Charles CRISP, a Police Officer of the King City Police Department, states that he joined the observation team 20 to 25 minutes after the initial sighting. His statement confirms that the thing, as viewed by Patrolman GALVIN and Patrolman MARISCAL, was a brilliantly lighted, stationary object approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter, which remained in near-cloud position for the duration of the observation. At no time after the sighting was this bright object able to be detected on their vehicle radioes. A statement at the home of Constable and Mrs. TRAGER, who watched at 2:05 AM on the morning light, corresponds with all the foregoing observations.

It is the opinion of the writer that any report of erratic movement or change of course in the flight, or any attempt to describe this object as saucer-shaped, disc-shaped, or any other conventional design is unwarranted, as the observation of this glowing, stationary object provides no basis for such a conclusion.

830 COMBAT SUPPORT GROUP
CASTLE AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

REFS: ATIC (PTM)

1. An investigation of an unidentified flying object was made on 19, 20, and 21 December 1962, on the basis of attachment 1 to this report.

2. The following military and civilian organizations were contacted during the course of the investigation, and all willingly cooperated, and provided as much assistance as possible:

a. Provost Marshal's Office, Fort Ord, California.
b. Department 7, 15th Weather Sqdn, USAF, Fritzsche Field, Fort Ord, California.
c. US Naval Air Facility, Monterey, California.
d. Monterey County Sheriff's Office, Salinas, California, and Sub-California, US Attorney and Judge City, Salinas.
e. Police Departments of King City, Greenfield, Soledad and Gonzales, California.
f. FAA Weather Station, Salinas, California Airport.
g. California State Division of Forestry, 480 Calle Principale, Monterey, California.

3. Description of the object was consistent, except for some minor variations. The object was round, varied in size from a dinner plate (10 - 12 inches). There was only one observed at a time. The object was observed to hover, make vertical ascents, and move in a diagonal direction. A faint glow from the object was attributed to ground fog; there was no sound. One observer related that in Soledad the object was followed by a larger and brighter object that he believed could have been causing squelch on the police radio.

4. Observers first noted the object because of its very bright light. Two observers at Fort Ord believed it to be a very bright star or planet.

- page 11 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document or report related to Project Blue Book, a former U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text output from the document:

When first observed was approximately 4:50 to 5:00, altitude estimated at 10,000 feet. Object appeared to the southeast of all observers. Three observers sighted the object over King City, California. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Altitudes varied between 25,000 and 60,000 feet. There was very little horizontal or diagonal movement, and there was no rapid movement in any direction. The object appeared to the south and finally disappeared. At daylight came to the area. Two observers described the disappearance of the object as being similar to the light in a television set when the set is turned off. The object then reappeared.

5. The manner of observation was ground-visual, and one observer used binoculars (7 x 50), the object was not reported by USAF radar sites.

6. Time of sighting was 0647Z through 1505Z, 11 December 1962. Light conditions were night for most of time and dawn for a brief period.

7. Three observers were located near the main gate to Fort Ord, California. The sightings were observed in King City and Greenfield.

8. Personnel observing the object are as follows:
a. Patrolman LARRY SCHUMACHER, age 25, Monterey Unit of Monterey County Military Police, but a fairly reliable observer.
b. Police Sergeant ROSEBET R. LARSEN, age 21, USS114890, Fort Ord, California.

f. Patrolman NORMAN L. (Nick) HIENZ, age 41
Greenfield Police Department. Very reliable observer, retired
Air Force veteran, Master Sergeant, considerable experience as
an observer.
g. Constable JOHN E. HOLSTROM, age 63
Greenfield Police Department:
Reliable observer, long time resident of the area.
h. Patrolman JOSEPH B. MONTANA, age 34
Soledad Police Department.
Very reliable observer, no previous military experience.
9. The nearest weather station was the FAA Station located at the
Salinas Airport. William R. Rinder, who was the specialist on duty at 12:32
a.m., December 9, 1962, reported that the weather conditions at that time were
as follows:
09:52 3/10 cloudiness at 4,000 10 mile visibility
10:22 1/10 cloudiness at 4,000 10 mile visibility
10:55 clear no clouds 10 mile visibility
11:22 clear no clouds 10 mile visibility
11:52 clear no clouds 6 mile visibility
He also stated that at 12:12, 1/4 December, the Oakland Air Traffic Control Center at Fremont, received a call from a Pan-American Airlines
pilot who was 35 miles south of the Oakland Airport. The pilot reported that he
had seen a bright and fast moving light, which appeared stationary for a few
seconds, then disappeared. Its direction, and velocity were not available. Wind
direction was from the Northeast at 15 mph.
10. Weather balloons released either by the US Coast Guard weather
station at Monterey or the weather station at Point Pinos. Calif. could have
been responsible for the sighting.
11. An improvised balloon released by a private citizen or prankster,
could also account for the sighting. Such balloons could be made of transparent plastic material, which can be purchased at any dry cleaning establishment. Large dry cleaners or department stores generally sell the material. Evidence that plastic bag balloons have been made and used by
individuals was found in the California sightings. All the necessary equipment to assemble all the necessary elements for a balloon - i.e. a plastic bag, a
fitted with an improvised device which would burn through the plastic
and cause a bright flash as the gas ignited. It would be possible for
an individual to assemble all the necessary equipment and launch a
balloon without any assistance. Attachments 3, 1, and 2 are photographs

There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book report, that contains text and a list of items.

Here is the text that has been extracted from the document:

or the balloons and devices found by the California State Forestry 
Division 400 Gallo Principale, Monterey, Mr. Richard E. Dietz, an 
associate Forester, advised that a 3 foot diameter metallic balloon 
was found with a parachute, plastic bags with packing tape, or any 
material strong enough to hold the weight. Mr. Dietz also advised that 
no information concerning the type of plastic balloons be released.

12. The behavior characteristics of the object were that of a balloon. 
The course of the balloon cannot be positively determined.
