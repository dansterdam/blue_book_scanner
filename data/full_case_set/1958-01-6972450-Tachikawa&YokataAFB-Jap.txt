The lower part of the image contains smaller diagrams or illustrations that seem to provide additional details about the UFO.

I have not identified or named any individuals in this image, as per the instructions provided.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:
I'm charged with looking something like my way for air force. one of the two planes turned directly toward as the thing we had started to come closer now they look only about half a mile away I say I don't believe my eyes it look like a large silver ball with an extremely bright light in the center rotating (skyline) about twenty feet across maybe more. It kept getting closer and closer to the plane so the pilot turned the plane directly into it when he got within a mile or so the object appeared to stop instantly and hover motionless in the air. It seemed to have a ring around it or something glowing brightly which would shoot out little sticks of light over twenty feet long then it would suck them back in. We continued to observe this for maybe two or three minutes the thing seemed at just about our altitude. Then all of a sudden it took off at a speed I have never seen anything move before. It appeared to just accelerate and zoom straight up into the clouds and that was all we saw of it.

NAME: [REDACTED]
GRADE OR STATUS: [REDACTED]
DATE: 12 January 1958
LOCATION: TACHIKAWA, JAPAN - YOKATA AFB, JAPAN
TIME: 6:45 PM 
DURATION OF SIGHTING: about 5 minutes
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: Five bright red lights in a perfect "V" formation, they were very bright, large and silent as they moved across the sky with a slight wobble at a very high speed. I observed them for about 5 minutes as they crossed the sky from horizon to horizon. They disappeared at the far horizon. No exhaust or trail was visible.
DIRECTION OF FLIGHT: East to West
ELEVATION OF OBJECT: approximately 45 degrees 
IDENTIFICATION DATA: These objects did not resemble any conventional aircraft that I have ever seen before. I am familiar with all types of military and civilian aircraft that are common in this area and these were definitely not any type of aircraft that I recognized.
ADDITIONAL REMARKS: I was standing outside my quarters at Tachikawa AFB, Japan at approximately 6:45 PM on 12 January 1958 when I observed five very bright red lights in a perfect "V" formation crossing the sky from east to west at a very high rate of speed. The lights were large, very bright, and completely silent as they moved across the sky. I watched them for approximately 5 minutes as they crossed from horizon to horizon and then disappeared at the far horizon. I did not see any exhaust or trail behind them. Based on their unusual appearance, flight characteristics, and the fact that I am very familiar with all types of aircraft common to this area and did not recognize these, I am convinced that these were not conventional aircraft of any type. I believe that I may have observed some type of Unidentified Flying Object.

Strange! Japan and the United States must continue to work together to solve unidentified aerial events concerning both security and aviation interests. One incident can decide the strength of our alliance. Alertness over national airspace is a must. Please pass any reports on UFO sightings made in Japan to this office so they can be compiled and evaluated for future analysis.
