SYNOPSIS
Investigation requested by Commander, DD #20, McChord AFB, Washington. The object was stationary during the ten seconds it was sighted. It disappeared by decreasing in size. Investigation ended with that there was a broken overcast at 7,000 feet and scattered broken clouds at 3,500 feet. A ceiling light was turned on at the Bellingham Airport, Bellingham, Washington, by the CAA Station attendant to determine cloud formation. ********** may have seen this light reflected off one of the scattered clouds. Only one known aircraft in the vicinity at the time of sighting. The planet, Jupiter, located at an altitude of 20 degrees above the horizon directly south from Bellingham, Washington, was shining intermittently with a yellowish-white to orange light.

DETAILS:

1. This investigation was requested by the Commander, Dcl. 720, Techord AFB, Washington, predicated upon receipt of information from 1st Lt. EDWAR KUNZMAN, AC-2027143, 318th Fighter Squadron, McChord AFB, to the effect that was like an air foil, colored red-orange, and appeared to be stationary with elevation approximately 15 degrees from the observer, directly south. It was observed for approximately ten seconds, then disappeared by decreasing in size, elevation remaining the same. The object was also observed by GEORGE * * *

2. This is a joint investigation of Special Agent JOSEPH C. LOHRMAN, CARTER O. COOPER, and the writer.

AT BELLINGHAM, WASHINGTON

3. On 20 August 1949, * * * was interviewed by Special Agent JOSEPH C. LOHRMAN, * * * Bellingham, Washington, and the following information was obtained; * * * stated that on 26 July 1949 at approximately 0015 hours, while standing outside his residence, the was returning to their home by auto, traveling north on * * * road, approximately six miles north of Bellingham, Washington, made a 90 degree turn to his left front northwest road on to Smith Road, traveling about fifteen miles per hour. For no particular reason, he glanced to his left and noted an object which appeared to be a burning aircraft. Lowering the car window and continuing to watch the object as he drove, the distance of six miles to the approximate size of the fuselage of a C-47 at the distance judged it to be. The object appeared to be at an approximate angle of 15 degrees above the horizon, and was egg shaped when first sighted, he watched for approximately ten seconds and the shape changed to a circular prior to its disappearance. e.g. described the color as red-orange and alight shod was stationary with no visible means of support, * * * observed no smoke, odor or sound. He stated that the sky was overcast, but there was a 100 to 1 chance that a clear cut opening in the overcast may have revealed the object for the ten seconds it was visible. The moon was not visible at any time event evening prior to or after the sighting. * * * was not able to determine the construction of the object or of what material or substance it was composed. The object faded from view by decreasing in size. * * *'s wife saw the object for approximately three seconds.

Special Agent LESLIE L. CLEVELAND conducted the following investigation:

4. Mr. O. W. BLANTON, Acting Officer in Charge, Civil Aeronautics administration, Bellingham Airport, Bellingham, Washington, was interviewed on 22 September 1949 at his office and securing the weather report for the 26th day of July 1949 noted the weather observance made at 0300 hours; "17,000 feet broken; 3,500 scattered; 15 miles visibility; pressure 14%"; temperature 56 degrees; and surface wind, south, 5 miles per hour. BLANC e.g. further stated that a ceiling light is used to determine the altitude of the clouds. This stationary light is turned on twice each hour during darkness while the weather is actually being observed. The light is very powerful and the beam is projected straight up. The weather report indicated th* stati * * * made on the lower clouds at

the 0030 hours observance. BLAINTON advised that sometimes these clouds give off a reddish color during certain atmospheric conditions or there is smoke in the air. He stated that he did not have a record of the winds aloft, but said information could be obtained from the United States Weather Bureau, Seattle, Washington. He also checked the records of the Airways Communication Station and stated that no contact was made with aircraft in the vicinity between the hours of 0001 and 0100. All flight plans are filed with the airways Communication Station and the aircraft normally contact the station when they are flying in the vicinity. This includes military and civilian type aircraft which are equipped with radios, excepting chartered commercial aircraft. BLAINTON advised that there has been some local night flying by civilian aircraft which on the field; however, there would most certainly not be any at 0045 hours with weather conditions being such as they were. BLAINTON further advised that Canadian aircraft are requested to contact the Bellingham Station upon entering the United States, and the records did not indicate any such contact.

5. Mr. ——— at Station Agent, United Airlines, Bellingham, Wash-
ington, was interviewed at his office at the Bellingham Airport on 22 September 1949 and stated in substance: The station is closed during the night; however, one of their aircraft flies over the vicinity at approximately 0020 hours each night. The aircraft normally fly at 5,000 feet, weather permitting. He further stated that if all lights were turned on in the passenger compartment of the planes, they could not be seen from the ground. The exhaust flames may be seen from the ground if the plane was flying very low; however, he considered it doubtful.

6. Mr. , was re-interviewed on 22 September 1949 at his home and questioned regarding the possibilities of the sighted object being a cloud passing through the beam or light being projected at the Bellingham Airport, and he started as follows: The object appeared, or seemed to be, over the Bellingham Airport and that he has observed ceiling lights at Bellingham Airport, Seattle, Washington, on numerous occasions and noted their effect upon the clouds. He did not believe that the object he saw was a cloud, but admitted it could have been. He reasoned that the color was too bright and the sharp outline of the object was too clear. He considered the possibilities of the object being a brilliant star, the moon, or a flare, then frankly admitted that he could not identify the object as being anything he had ever seen before. He stated that he was very exhausted at the time he sighted the object and that he was not too alert or observant during the ten seconds the object was in sight.

AT EVERETT, WASHINGTON

7. Major WILLIAM R. FELTENBAUM, Commanding Officer, 25th Air Division, Everett, Washington was interviewed at his office on 22 September 1949, by the writer and he advised that the radar detachment maintains a log on unidentified objects that are picked up by the radar. This log was checked and revealed no information regarding objects that were sighted in the Bellingham area between 0001 and 0100 hours on 26 July 1949.

Mr. L. J. SANDSBERYT, Map and Plotting Department, United States
Weather Bureau, Seattle, Washington, was interviewed on 23 September 1949,
at his office and he stated as follows: The Patooah Island Station would be
the nearest station to Bellingham, Washington, which records wind aloft.
SANDSBERYT secured the records and from then determined the following informa-
tion recorded at the Patooah Island Station at 0100 hours, 26 July 1949: "Winds
at 2,000 feet, direction 270 degrees, 13 knots; 6,000 feet, 240 degrees, 4
knots; and 9,000 feet, 310 degrees, 9 knots". SANDSBERYT advised that no weather

of Bellingham, Washington. The planet at that time had a magnitude of "minus 2"
which would make it 6.3 times brighter than Vega. The color of the planet was
yellowish-white to orange, depending upon the atmospheric conditions. The
