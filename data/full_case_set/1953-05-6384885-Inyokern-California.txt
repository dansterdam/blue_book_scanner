Transcription of the text in the document:

Inyokern, California 16 May 1953

I. DESCRIPTION
The Inyokern Naval Air Facility at the Naval Ordnance Test Station received a report from one of their civilian employees that several strange objects were overhead at 1810 PST, and disappeared to the northeast climbing rapidly. Altitude was estimated to be approximately 20,000 feet while over Inyokern. Objects appeared to be round or balloon-like with strings hanging down. No photographs were obtained. The observation was made accidentally and the objects were not tracked by radar. Several other civilians at this station also observed these objects.

II. DISCUSSION
This information was received from the Research Division, 'Naval Air Missile Test Center, China Lake, California. The description of the research balloons (Moby Dick) tied together. More information will be available when the USAF report 112 is received. Also, Project Blue Book receives the plots for all Moby Dick type balloons released in that area. The Project Blue Book evaluation of possibly identical balloon-like objects will undoubtedly be substantiated upon receipt of the additional information.

III. CONCLUSION
Possibly balloon (Moby Dick).
