The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, specifically a letter dated November 8, 1960.

The text in the document is as follows:

4 November 1960

Dear Mr.

The unidentified flying object observed on or about 7 October 1960 has been thoroughly investigated and evaluated by this headquarters.

Your letter contained insufficient information for a valid analysis. Specifically, we do not have the exact time, location, duration and description of the sighting which would be required for a detailed investigation and evaluation.

From the little information given, it is believed the object viewed was possibly a meteor or other celestial phenomenon.

Sincerely,

EDWARD J. RUPPELT
Lt Colonel, USAF

OCR output:

Dear Sir:

On the night of October 7th, I observed an object appear above the trees and pass over my house at a rapid rate of speed. It was illuminated and made no noise. The object was round in shape and appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter. It seemed to be traveling in a southwesterly direction at an altitude of approximately 1000 to 1500 feet. I tried to get a better look at it but it passed out of sight in a few seconds. I have had similar experiences when I have observed objects of this type on other occasions, but this was the first time I have been able to get a good look at one. I would appreciate your comments on this incident.

Sincerely yours,
