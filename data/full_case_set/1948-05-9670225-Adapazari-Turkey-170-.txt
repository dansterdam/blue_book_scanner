The image provided appears to be a scanned document and does not contain any photographs. It is a form with some typed text and handwritten notes, but the quality of the scan is quite poor, making it difficult to read accurately. Here is what I can discern, though some words are illegible due to the quality of the image:

```

[Illegible line containing "REMARKS"]

OBJECT [Illegible] R. COVERED

[Illegible content at the bottom of the document]
```

Unfortunately, the limited legibility of the text means that parts of the document cannot be accurately transcribed. The document seems to be related to a UFO incident report. The handwritten note possibly refers to an object being identified as a "Circle (Rocket)" and mentions something being "R. COVERED," which could mean "Recovered." The form is dated May 5, 1949, and mentions a location in Turkey.

The image provided does not contain a photograph or image of an object. It is a page containing text. The text from the document reads as follows:

---

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #170 -- Adapazari, Turkey -- c. 5 May 1948

It is extremely unlikely that there is any astronomical explanation for this incident. The information given is very limited, but it points definitely to the probability that the object or objects sighted were rockets. The report indicates that one rocket-like object was recovered.

Please note: N/S appears to represent "Not Stated" or "Not Specified" throughout the document. The last line in the remarks section and the number in brackets have markings that make them illegible. There are censor redactions present in the document (text covered with black bars). There are also handwritten marks on the document, but I am directed only to transcribe the printed text, so the transcription does not include these handwritten notations.

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a written document. Here is the text from the document:

```
Item from Turkish newspaper "Yeni Sabah" Istanbul, 5 May 4c:

There have been reports lately to the effect that shining objects like
meteors, have been sighted in various parts of the country. Some people
suggest that these might be rockets. Information received from authorized
circles reveals that such a thing passed over Adapazari and was seen to
explode in the air. Parts of it fell into a village nearby and killed a
sheep dog. The thing was fouad to be a rocket and the debris will be
inspected by experts. Oberrs

Observers say that the rocket which is claimed to have come from the Northwest
was flying at an altitude of 200 meters over Adapazari before it fell.

According to rumors, it is possible that the rocket is connected with the
"flying disc" experiments being conducted by the Russians at the station on
Mt. Ararat close to the eastern frontiers.

SOURCE: MA, Ankara, Turkey, 10 May 1948, Serial 5643, Incl F-0.

COMMENT: Air Attache, Ankara, Turkey, has been requested to investigate this
incident fully and encourage Turkish General Staff to do likewise.
Whether incident can be confirmed or not Air Attache has been
directed to determine sources for information contained in Yeni
Sabah article.
