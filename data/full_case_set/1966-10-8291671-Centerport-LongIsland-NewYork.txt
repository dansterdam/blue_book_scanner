There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The regulation which covers UFO reports is AFR 200-2. Refer to this with your CD report in the morning.

One final note. Most UFO reports are rather routine "lights-sighters". When a report comes in that is obviously based on tangible evidence, or when several reports of sightings at the same time are received, contact the Operations Duty Officer through the C 493. Reports are much more easily investigated at the time of than a day or two later. Your cooperation and good sense will not Force investigate these sightings in a professional manner.
