28 May 1953
ATIC COMMENT: On the same night as the attached sighting, at approximately 8:30 P.M., two ATIC technicians well versed in astronomy also observed this object. There was no doubt in their minds but what the subject object was an extremely bright meteor which burned for about 5 to 6 seconds on a downward path. According to these sources, the object had a green-white hue. ATIC feels that there is a goodexample of how known phenomenon can cause widespread speculation due to an overly anxious observer. The fact that a meteor sighting was carried in a Dayton paper and advertised as a possible saucer plus the fact that the Control Tower at Wright-Patterson was quoted as saying that they had no report which might explain it, all makes for adverse publicitywhere a known object has touched off a saucer craze.

OPERATIONS REPORT - 23-29 MAY 1953
UNCLASSIFIED

The following numbered items of interest were noted in Project Blue Book operations for the above period:

1. Progress report was received from Project Stork, contractor for Blue Book, on 24 May 1953. Sighting reports up to and including 31 December 1952 have all been processed and evaluated. All data for sightings up to and including 31 December 1952 have been transferred to IBM cards. Analysis of data contained on IBM cards was begun on 12 May 1953. By 10 June, after completion of the first phase of analysis of data, a preliminary report will be submitted to Project Blue Book.

Two one-day evaluation conferences were held during 23 and 24 April 1953. Three ATIC representatives and four representatives from STORK took part. Evaluation of 400 questionnaires was completed.

2. Recently an unidentified flying object was sighted over Dayton, Ohio and reported to the W-P AFB Control Tower. Project Blue Book feels that this case is a good example of misrepresentation of known phenomena. The observer was a woman who sighted an extremely bright object for a very short time arching downward and reported seeing the same to W-P AFB as an unidentified flying object.

The observer made the sighting at 8:48 p.m. On the same night, two ATIC scientists sighted the same object and described it as an extremely bright meteor lasting five to six seconds and having a green-white view. There was no question in the minds of these qualified observers that this object was a meteor.

The text in the document reads:

The sighting was publicized in a Dayton newspaper. This is a good example of how known phenomena can cause wide-spread speculation, due to an inexperienced observer. Two factors are interesting to note: (1) That the incident was carried in a newspaper, and (2) that the newspaper story increased that V-F-293 never could not identify it. This is the type of publicity given to known objects which touches off the "saucer" hysteria.
