Civilian to photograph the map. The photographer answered that he
did many picture and a picture was taken. A second picture was taken of Lt. Rogers and Lt. Captain (?) at a table with the map.
The unknown captain did not wish to have his name used, but consented
to same.
Lt Rogers left Mitchell for Dover that evening.

BBC d. On 11-12-51 at 1931, Capt Mitchell and Capt Rogers of McGuire AFB, N.J. received a call from a station mentioning that the object was again sighted over Dover. Some officers rushed to the tower to view the object, but their view was obscured. When 1st Lt. Ballard arrived, the object had disappeared. Lt Rogers said that he had obtained permission to discuss the matter with them, but lacer a report stated that he had been told not to discuss it, as he was very not to be able to discuss the matter with them, but could not give any satisfactory explanation.
Later a report stated that he might have discussed it with them, but was told by the officer in charge on responsibility of
obtaining more information. He called EADS who called USAF and the one who called USAF was a Mr. Rogers, a Lt. on Commanding
Generals Staff.

Later, a Lt. East at Dover - received a call to say the object was not seen.

J-2 on 11-17-53 ordered Lt Ballard and Lt Rogers to investigate for interview
concerning the incidents. Went to Sewcoth field and Lt Rogers talked to Lt Ballard of what had occurred

called Sgt Rogers (Jansson) of Roswell, New Mexico 25 September, said the officers had returned to Dover after the incident, but the evidence they had collected was not 41.12 days after. He stated they had only seen the object for.a few seconds.

Sgt Rogers further stated that he had talked to Colonel or Major Ballard and was told that he was happy about the whole incident
as the object they had seen was "something unidentified flying over the target". He further stated that Ballard said to him, "don't you think you officers have done a pretty good job" - and authority to Ballard
to interview the witnesses and look into the incident was given.

Colonel or Major Ballard, said Sgt Rogers, was enthusiastic about the incident with Lt Rogers and Major or Captain Hendricks, and wanted any
further information or developments. He offered co operate in any way possible in continuing the investigation.

According to Sgt Rogers, it appeared that the officers at Dover were studying the matter that was of importance, and that they considered the object of importance. The indications were that the object was electrically propelled.

Capt. Mitchell reported that the object seen was about 50 feet in diameter, circular in shape and moving at a high rate of speed. Weather conditions were clear.

It was noted that the officers reporting the sighting were experienced in observation of aircraft and that they were convinced the object was strange and not an aircraft as presently known.
It was determined that LtRogers had previously been in touch with Sewcoth field regarding the incidents.

Based on the image, there does not appear to be a photograph present. The image shows a page from a document that appears to be a report on a flying saucer sighting near Sandy Hook, New Jersey, on September 11, 1951.

Transcribing the text from the image:

Flying saucer report 11 September 1951

A P-33 Jet fighter landed at Mitchell at 1145 yesterday, the 10th of September. The pilot reported that they had seen in the sky over Sandy Hook a round object moving at a terrific rate of speed. With an arc light like motion it was within their field of vision for about two minutes. They were traveling at 400 miles an hour, at a height of 20,000 feet. The object was approximately 12 to 15 feet in diameter, and crossed in front of them to Asbury Park, where it veered out to sea. They believe that the object was being influenced from the object because it had that effect, that is it, slowed, whatever it was. They reported this to operating officer when they landed, and wonder it got to the ears of one of the local newspapers on long island?

Col: Yes, you are right, is that correct?

Maj. D. I would suggest that the basic facts be on the press inquiries. (I Leave that the facts as reported to me by the pilots) The pilots made no mention of the fact that they saw a flying saucer, but merely reported that they had seen a strange object, moving it a speed they estimate to be in excess of 500 miles an hour, in an arc-like direction, over Sandy Hook. In response to the press inquiries, we gave the facts as related to us by these pilots, and as required by regulations, when I was queried on this matter.

Col: Yes, I'm getting it, go ahead.

Maj. D: I think I've given you the basic facts of the matter. I don't know how hard reached the newspapers were, but as required by regulations, when I was asked to check the story by the press, I checked it, I found out the report to be true and I released the story, as given to me by the pilots.

The OCR text from the document is as follows:

Col T: At this point, may I ask you whether you personally interviewed the pilots?

Maj B: I talked to one of them on the phone, but I didn't see them.

Col T: Was he able to give you any additional description of the object, as to its apparent shape, methods of propulsion, possible construction, and so on?

Maj B: Yes, he said it was a round object, which reflected the sun's rays, indicating a metallic surface. That supports simply my interpretation, - they say it reflected rays - That is was moving in an arc-like direction, they said it was an arc-like movement, but straight, - in an arc, and that when they got approximately 3000 feet from it, it veered, and went out to sea and vanished completely. Now I was told by Lt. Rodgers that he communicated with one of the radar setups in this vicinity, and asked him to check, and he told me that he did not pick up a[n] object at all. Nothing appeared on the screen.

Col T: The radar unit did check during the time of operation and did not report anything, appearing on the radar scope.

Maj B: That as I remember Lt. Rodgers conversation with me, - at the time I didn't make any particular note of it but it has since come up, and seems to be important that I believe that's true. This Colonel, perhaps you'll want to include in those papers as a former holder of that office.

Col T: They are assigned to a fighter interceptor wing at Dover, is that Dover, Delaware? Dover, Maryland

Maj B: I believe it's Delaware sir, but I'm not certain.

Col T: Yes. What is the designation of their unit, do you know?

Maj B: It was 147th Fighter Interceptor Unit.

Maj B: 142th Fighter Interceptor, yes, - either Wing or Group.
Col T: All right, - we are very glad indeed to have this information and we'll evaluate it here, one reason I wanted to get a complete report from you so that I can turn it over to our Intelligence people here. And we will get in touch with you if we would like to ask you to take any more action on it.
Maj B: All right sir.
Col T: Meanwhile, I don't see anything else you could have done in the circumstances, concerning the Press. I'm glad to know that no release was initiated, but I can easily
Maj B: I assure you Colonel that my office has said nothing about this story until they were worried by the newspapers.
Col T: That's good. I understand that and that's a very good thing - I'm glad you handled it that way. So we will not take any official action to it here, - nothing, if you get any additional information please call me again.
Maj B: Right sir, - how can I give you my extension in case you need it?
Col T: If you will, Sir, please.
Maj B: It's Extension 3115, or 222. My full name is Major John Barton.
Col T: All right, - thank you very much indeed.

SUBJECT: (Unclassified) UNKNOWN SUBJECT: Release of Information to the Press Concerning an Unidentified Flying Object, 11 Sep 1951 - VIOLATION OF AFR 205-1
TO: Director of Intelligence, FOR COMMENT BY: 1 OCT 1951 
COMMENT NO. 1
FROM: Counter Intelligence Div, Lt. Col. Special Investigator General

At approximately 0330 hours on 1 October 1951, a TWX was received by OSI District #2, 67 Broad Street, New York 4, N.Y., from Lt. Colonel Nathan Robert Rosengarten, AFOIC-1, which requested an investigation as to the circumstances surrounding a press release on 11 September 1951 concerning an aerial object observed over Sandy Hook, New Jersey. This article, as released, was substantially as follows:

Two similar objects from Dover AFB, Delaware, reported they saw a strange moving object in the sky over Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The object was about the size of the full moon, estimated to be about 10 miles an hour. The object was in the field of vision for approximately two minutes. They were unable to state definitely what they saw but certainly saw something strange in the sky.

Pursuant to the request of Lt. Colonel Rosengarten, Major Bernard Barron, USAF was interviewed on 1 October 1951. It was stated that he had been instructed by Lt. Col. Duffy to be the interview officer, as requested, although he was positive that the two officers had submitted a written report concerning the object observed over Sandy Hook on 11 September 1951, when interviewed on 18 September 1951.

However, insofar as flying objects are not classified information, this inquiry was directed in the belief that there was a possible violation of AFR 205-1 by the release of information beyond that authorized. The PIO did not indicate anything about a possible violation of AFR 205-1, and stated that the TWX from Lt. Colonel Rosengarten had prompted a routine inquiry as to the facts of the press release of 11 September.

the Press and, accordingly, when he was requested by Aurelio for permission to inter-view Lt. Rogers, the request was granted.
3. Mr. Dick Aurelio was interviewed on 1 October 1951, and his story is as follows:
At about 1400 hours 10 September 1951, he overheard a couple of airmen, rank unknown, talking about a report of an unusual object sighted by two pilots who had landed at Mitchell AFB. This conversation was overheard in a diner located at Hampstead, New York. At 1500 hours, 10 September, Aurelio called Major Eugen and sought him about a report of an unusual object carried by a jet aircraft. Aurelio was told that he had no information on a jet landing at Mitchell AFB. Aurelio was satisfied and thought there was some basis for the report he had overheard and contacted Lt. Rogers at Base Operations, Mitchell AFB. Rogers told him that he had "spoken to a Lt. Pearson at Base Operations, Mitchell AFB and Pearson was a coordinator for Project Blue Book at Mitchell AFB. Aurelio thought that he (Lt. Rogers) should notify Lt. Pearson of the incident as it was, in fact, reported by Lt. Rogers and his passenger, who was a Captain Swain. Lt. Aurelio stated that he was granted permission to interview Lt. Rogers, which was granted.
4. An initial report of investigation is being prepared by OSI Special #2, which goes forth details on this matter to the Director of Intelligence, USAF, and will be reflected in your Directives and AUC upon receipt by this office.

1. Investigation predicated upon a T/C F.I.C. 02.22, from Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey, by Lt. Colonel ROSBBRRY, to investigate circumstances of release of information to the press by Public Information Officer, Mitchel Air Force Base, New York, 10 September 1951.

2. This investigation conducted by Special Agent PAUL L. MC COY.

3. On 1 October 1951, the public Information Officer, Mitchel Air Force Base, MAJOR B. BARSON, AC-10-12092, was interviewed relative to any press release on 10 September 1951 which may have constituted a violation of security.

4. Major BARRON informed the writer that the only release out of the ordinary was concerning the interview with the two pilots who had been attached to the Sandy Hook, New Jersey, by the pilots flying into Mitchel Air Force Base.

5. Major BARRON was requested to furnish this writer any information which he might have concerning the appearance of a newspaper article which appeared in the 11 September 1951 edition of NEWSDAY, a Long Island daily paper, in the presence of the writer.

6. Major BARRON dictated the following statement concerning the article, "1 October 1951".

"At 1230 hours, on 10 September 1951, I received a telephone call from Mr. DICK AURIELLO, a reporter for NEWSDAY. AURIELLO stated that he checked with a report which his newspaper had received, that a strange object had been seen by two pilots over Sandy Hook, New Jersey.

I called Base Operations and talked to a Sergeant on duty. He told me that he had no knowledge of such a report.

I called Mr. AURIELLO to tell him we knew nothing about such a report.

At 1900 hours, LT. AURIELLO again called me and said that he had positive information that the two pilots had seen a strange object in the sky. He was called Base Operations, 21 who believed Lito be identical with the report from Dover Air Force Base regarding a strange object over Sandy Hook.

I called LT. AURIELLO and informed him that the object being sighted was apparently aircraft being tested, and requested that he interview the two pilots. In accordance with established public information policy, such permission was granted."

TO THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION, I THEN TOOK THE FOLLOWING STEPS: 1) AT 0300 HOURS, 11 SEPTEMBER, I INITIATED A SERIES OF TELEPHONE CALLS TO APPRISE HIGHER HEADQUARTERS OF THE FACT THAT A NEWSPAPER STORY WOULD APPEAR ABOUT WHAT WAS CALLED BY THE REPORTER TO BE A "FLYING SAUCER" STORY. I CALLED THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER TO BE CURRENT ON HIS ACTIVITY UNDER PROJECTS GRUDGE AND BLUEBOOK. I THEN CALLED THE ASSISTANT PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER AND INSTRUCTED HIM CONCERNING HOW TO HANDLE FOLLOW-UP INQUIRY FROM REPORTERS ABOUT THIS "FLYING SAUCER"  

INCIDENT. COLONEL HARRIS AND COLONEL CADE USAF, COLONEL CADE SUGGESTED THAT I CALL THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER OR LT COLONEL SANBORN, AND SUGGESTED THAT I OBTAIN WHAT COULD BE OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED ON NEWS STORIES ABOUT "FLYING SAUCERS".

COLONEL PARKER, PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER, MR MATERIAL COMMAND, AND COLONEL CADE CALLED ME FROM WASHINGTON FOR FURTHER DETAILS, WHICH I GAVE HIM. ALSO, ON THE DIRECTION OF COLONEL CADE, I IMMEDIATELY CONFERRED WITH CAPTAIN HOWARD, OPERATIONS OFFICER, CONCERNING WHAT COULD BE SAID PUBLICLY ABOUT THE INCIDENT.

THROUGHOUT THE 11TH OF SEPTEMBER, I RECEIVED TELEPHONE CALLS FROM PRACTICALLY EVERY NEWSPAPER AND RADIO NEWS SOURCE IN NEW YORK CITY. THEIR QUESTION WAS, IN GENERAL, WHAT CAN BE SAID OFFICIALLY ABOUT THE INCIDENT AT SANDY HOOK, NEW JERSEY. I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT SINCE THE INCIDENT IS AS MOVING RAPIDLY AND IS DESCRIBED IN VARIOUS NEWS ITEMS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY IN VIEW OF THE AIR FORCE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE POLICY. ALSO, ON THE MORNING OF THE 11TH SEPTEMBER, I INDICATED AND WROTE CONCERNING AS TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND MY ANSWERS TO QUERIES.

The text in the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED

"The following representation was best of my recollection: "Two pilots from Dover Air Force Base have reported that they saw a strange object in the sky over Sandy Hook, New Jersey. It was moving at an extremely rapid rate which was estimated in excess of 600 miles an hour. They had the object in view for approximately two minutes. They reported that it moved with an arc-like motion. They are not able to identify it. They gave no further description. My suggest is that two pilots say a flying saucer. I am fully aware of the Air Force attitude toward flying saucers and would urge circumspection. My guess is that no member of the press that an Air Force pilot saw an object fully identified as a flying saucer."

AT HEMPSTEAD, NEW YORK

"On 1 October 1951, Mr. RICHARD R. AURELIO, reporter for NEWSDAY, who writes the by-line of "DAILY DIARY," 235 Villa Court Street, Hempstead, New York, in an interview, AURELIO stated that sometime during September 1951 while in a diner near Mitchell Air Force Base, two airmen were discussing the landing of an object, which AURELIO could not understand. They went to the office and called Major EATON, Public Information Officer at Mitchell Air Force Base, to request the information he had obtained. Major EATON told them that Operations had no information concerning the report of the unidentified object."

8. AURELIO then asked EATON to have the call relayed to Operations and he stated the information relayed would not confirm or deny the information, and was reluctant to talk, which led AURELIO to believe that PERSON was withholding information which he (AURELIO) had overheard. AURELIO called EATON again and told him to call PERSON, that the information he had given pilots had been, EATON called back shortly and confirmed the report that two transient pilots had.

9. AURELIO stated that he then requested permission to interview the pilots, which was granted by EATON. AURELIO then advised his editor of the possibility of a story and was directed to interview the pilots. AURELIO consultant/LT WILSHER J. POPE-15, pilots. A member of the 142nd Fighter Interceptor Wing located at Dover, Delaware, who gave him this information which was garnered a story that was published in NEWSDAY on 3 September 1951 and again on 7 September 1951.

Transcription of the text in the document:

10. The following morning the story was first released over the wires of the United Press and the Associated Press. AURELIO stated that this made the story available to all newspapers and associated press. The information was not released until the morning of 11 September, in order that SATURDAY would be the first paper to carry this story.

11. AURELIO stated that he would be unable to identify the person whom he had overheard in his office. He was unable to recall their voice, and could only hazard a guess as to where they might work on the base. His impression was that they were mechanics and were discussing information which they had overheard.

AT LIEUTENANT AIR FORCE BASE, NEW YORK

12. On 2 October 1951, Major RIDGELY H. BELLOW, AG-2070703, Public Information Officer, Hq. First Air Force, was interviewed concerning the news article in question and that, in his opinion, there had not been a violation of security, since he knew of no regulation or policy which prohibited newspapermen from writing stories concerning Air Force activities which were unclassified.

13. LIEUTENANT COLONEL ELLISTON, AC-2/0703, Public Information Officer, stated that this article existed which set forth instructions for releasing information regarding the program in question, dated 27 April 1951, titled AIR FORCE PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAM.

14. Paragraphs 2b and c of AFR 190-6 are set forth below:

"Par 2b - This Air Force information concerning the collection, correlation and utilization of all data and intelligence which could assist the Air Force in gaining superiority in the defense program is based on the policy that the full record of the Air Force operations, subject only to security restrictions and the dictates of good taste."

"Par 3c - Consist of full cooperation with civilian scientists and educators in research and studies leading to the advancement of the science of aeronautics, based on the policy that harmonious relations with the civilian population will be maintained."

15. On 2 October 1951, AURELIO called the writer to inform that a statement which he had made was not to be made public, since his editor had not authorized its release. No attempt was made to interview the editor.

PORT MONMOUTH, NEW JERSEY, INCIDENTS
On 10 and 11 September 1951, a series of both visual and radar sightings were reported from the Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, area.
I. VISUAL SIGHTINGS BY "PILOT" ALL PASSAGE OF T-33 AIRCRAFT 
A. Discussion
At approximately 1135 an unidentified object was sighted by the pilot of an F-86 aircraft. The object appeared to be over Sandy Hook, New Jersey, between 5000 ft. and 8000 ft. at 11 o'clock from the pilot's position. The T-33, at the time of the initial sighting, was on a GCA (ground control approach) circuit to land, when the pilot noted the object off to the left in his 11 o'clock position. The object, the pilot stated, was a light or self-luminous body, seemed to be elongated, and showed a reddish-orange glow. The pilot made a 180 degree turn towards the object, but it disappeared from view before he could close in for a better observation. At one point, the passenger, an air force major, who had been making a radio check, stated that the object "streaked by us at a terrific speed, making a 1:00 turn toward the coast". The pilot continued his 360 degree turn but could not relocate the object. The descending turn of the T-33 had been increased from 220 to 550 m.p.h. and the altitude decreased from 17,000 down to 8,000 feet during this observation.
When first sighted, the object appeared to be descending over Sandy Hook. New Jersey. As the T-33 pilot attempted to close in, it maneuvered with startling rapidity. The object was said to have the color of silver, but did not reflect the sunlight. The size was estimated to be 50 ft. to 75 ft. in diameter.
At approximately 1315, 16 September 1951, two balloons were released from the Wave Signal Laboratory. These balloons were 6 ft. x 8 ft. in diameter at time of release and ascended to an average height of 60,000 ft. The balloons were visible for several minutes following release and were closely observed by the project engineer. It is believed that the balloons could have been mistaken for the unidentified object sighted earlier, due to their size and manner of release. However, the pilot stated that the object he saw was considerably larger and more rapid in its maneuvers than the balloons.
Efforts were made to use the information obtained from the interrogation of the witnesses to plot the course of the unidentified object. However, due to the fact that the data given was consistent with such a conclusion, no definite course could be established.
In an attempt to establish the fact that the object was a balloon, a flight with a calibrated radar was flown in the area on 15 September 1951. However, no returns were obtained which could be attributed to the object sighted on 10 and 11 September. It is therefore believed that the object was not a balloon, but an unidentified flying object.

the object they could not identify wss a balloon. During the interrogations subsequent to this sighting, two individuals gave conflicting accounts as to location of the object, one stating the object differed from the usual balloon. However, according to the report, this variance of opinions was not considered to be nearly so correct.
According to the resumed flight, math on the incident overlay, it will be noted that a oalioon radius of approx, 8 feet would be indicated to be over Sandy Hook. It will be noted that the 3-1 plot indicated closer to the horizon is believed to be over Sandy Hook. (see Figure 1.)

II. RANGER OBSERVATION

A. Discussion
The report indicates that on the night of September 10, 1951, a ranger at Sandy Hook, New Jersey observed an unidentified flying object. The object was described as having a bright light that seemed to be shifting between white, green, and orange colors. The object moved silently and erratically, making rapid changes in direction and speed. The ranger observed the object for several minutes before it disappeared from view.

B. Conclusion
Based on the details provided, the ranger's observation appears to be of a genuine unidentified flying object. The report states that the object exhibited characteristics not consistent with known aircraft or other explainable phenomena. Further investigation may be warranted to try to determine the nature and origin of the observed object.

2. On 10 September 1951, 1415 hours, an ADC 504, serial number 423, tracked a target which moved about slowly in a circular motion, north of Fort Monmouth at a steady distance of 5,000 yards. The angular elevation was about 1,500 mils. This is proven to be a weather balloon, according to examination by weather personnel. The officer in charge of the operation of the ADC 504 estimated the target to be at an altitude of 7,000 feet.

and 215, 3. On 11 September 1951, 1620 hours, two ADC 504's, serial numbers 217 and 216, tracked an unknown object. The object maneuvered as an elevation change from 4,000 feet to 7,000 feet. The object was tracked automatically in azimuth and elevation (altitude 7,000 feet). The note trace automatically in azimuth and elevation altitude 7,000 feet. The note trace automatically recorded the azimuth and elevation traces. In this case, however, both sets seemed impossible to trace the target properly due to the erratic motion of the object. In order to hold the target, the operator was forced to "pump" the control in order to hold the target. The suspect that the erratic movement was due to the effect of the weather conditions prevailing at the time, namely, a high wind and turbulence. This condition provided the maximum limited tracking ability of the radar set.

However, the radar was unable to provide an accurate range on the target. The maximum slant tracking ability of the radar set was approximately 25,000 yards, but the actual range was undetermined and could have been below normal return.

This incident proves to be a weather balloon. It was determined as such from later date data, October 1951, the item 1, which stated: "weather balloon was identified".

3. On 11 September 1951, at about 1730, a target was picked up on an ADC radar, serial number 1. What could not be measured accurately was the speed as the target maneuvered so rapidly. The target appeared to be from 5,000 to 9,000 feet in altitude. The target maneuver was so rapid, however, overcast conditions prevented a good track. This incident is probably an example of anomalous propagation, where the target was an object in the overcast observed to be maneuvering. It was not possible to determine the exact nature of this incident, but the elevation did not rise above a certain area, thus indicating it was not and aircraft and its elevation at an extreme radar rate was so small, the change in range was not detectable.

It is highly probable that this is an example of anomalous propagation. The incidents indicate that they were aware of this phenomenon, however, it is highly possible that they were unsure of the true nature of this sighting and had difficulty determining what they actually observed based on the limited data and tracking ability of their radar systems at the time.

III. CONCLUSIONS

A. The 1030 GCT sighting reported by a balloon launched by the Lyons airmail station as being observed by a PSA operator to occur eight minutes before the T-33 aircraft sighting.

B. The 1110 GCT radar sighting on 10 September 1951 was a weather balloon.

C. The 1215 GCT radar sighting on 10 September 1951 was a weather balloon.

D. The 1050 GCT radar sighting on 11 September 1951 was a weather balloon.

E. The 1335 GCT radar sighting on 11 September 1951 was a known but unidentified target. The 13X GCT possible radar target on 11 September 1951 was unknown but the possibility that it was the same target observed by the ground based observation post operator should not be overlooked.

APPENDIX VI

FORT MONMOUTH, NEW JERSEY - 10-11 SEPTEMBER 1951

On 10 and 11 September 1951, a series of incidents occurred in the area of Fort Monmouth, N. J. An initial sighting of an unidentified object was made on 10 September by the radar station of the 6518th Test Squadron, two air force officers in a T-33 aircraft unsuccessfully attempted to intercept an unidentified object. Later several more sightings were reported.

STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

A complete investigation of this incident was carried out and will be reported in detail to AFOIN-V2. It has been tentatively determined that the T-33 pilots probably observed a balloon that had been released from the area. Although there were several other visual observations and the object was tracked on radar, it is believed these were either caused by the same balloon or were unidentified objects of a similar nature. The investigation is continuing in an effort to determine the cause of the incident and the exact nature of the objects observed.

1. The following report is in accordance with ADC Letter 200-1, Reporting of Information on Unconventional Aircraft:

a. The unidentified object, which was sighted at about 1135 DST Monday September 10th, was round and flat in shape. The size of the unconventional object is estimated to be a diameter of 50-50 feet in diameter. Only one object was sighted and no contrail was observed at any time. The estimated speed of the object was in excess of 600 miles per hour. The object was sighted at one time and the observers lost sight of it again and it appeared definitely to have flown out to sea.

b. Time of observation was between 1135 and 1140 DST. 

c. The manner of observation was visual. The object was sighted from Dover Air Force Base. The T-33 was circling at 20,000 feet at about 450 miles per hour when the object was sighted at least 12,000' below at eleven o'clock position. After making a gradual 180 degree descending turn to 17,000 feet the T-33 was making good over 500 miles per hour when the object disappeared out to sea.

d. The observers were Maj. Albert S. Rogers and Maj. Ezra Ballard, Jr. Both men are experienced fighter pilots.

Flying Saucer report 11 September 1951

A P-33 Jet fighter landed at Mitchell at 1145 yesterday, the 10th of September. 
The pilot reported that they had seen in the sky over Sandy Hook a round object moving at a terrific rate of speed. With an arc like motion it was within their field of vision for about two minutes. They were travelling at 450 miles an hour, at a height of 20,000 feet. The object was approximately 8000 feet below them. They peeled off to take a closer look at it, and chased it to attempt to change its course, but they barely believe their eyes - it was so fast.

'The object was a grayish white, and was giving out a bright light, which they believe was the sun's rays being reflected from the object because it had that effect, that is it blinded them for a moment, whatever it was.' They reported this to operations officer when they landed, and somehow it got to the ears of one of the Long Island newspapers.

Col T: Yes, you made no release on it, is that correct?
Maj B: I made no release on it, said nothing, but then I got the press inquiries. (I gave them the facts as reported to me by the pilot.) The pilots made no mention of the fact that they saw a flying saucer, but merely reported that they had seen a strange object, moving at a speed they estimate to be in excess of 900 miles an hour, in an extremely risky direction, over Sandy Hook. In response to the press inquiries, we gave the facts as reported to us by the two pilots, who were by name Lt. W. Rogers, who was piloting the ship at the time, and Capt. E. Ballard, Jr., both of the Fighter Interceptor Wing at Dover.

Col T: Yes, I'm getting it, go ahead.
Maj B: I think I've given you the basic facts of the matter. I don't know how word reached the newspapers here, but as required by regulations, when I was asked to check the story by the press, I checked it, I found out the report to be true and I released the story, as given to me by the pilots.

Col T: All right, may I ask you at this point whether you personally interviewed the pilots?
Maj B: I talked to one of them on the phone, but I didn't see them.
Col T: Was he able to give you any additional description of the object, as to its apparent shape, methods of propulsion, possible construction, and so on?
Maj B: No, he said it was a round object which reflected the sun's rays, indicating a metallic surface. That appears simply my interpolation, - they say it reflected rays - That it was moving in an arc-like direction, they said it was an arc-like movement, not straight - in an arc, and that when they got approximately 8000 feet from it, it veered, and went out to sea and vanished completely. Now I was told by Lt. Rogers that he communicated with one of the radar set-ups in this vicinity, and asked them to search, and he told me that the response was entirely negative.
Col T: The radar unit did check during the course of operation and did not report anything appearing on the radar scope.
Maj B: That as I remember Lt Rogers conversation with me, - at the time I didn't make any particular note of it but it has since come up, and seems to be important and I believe that's true. Now, Colonel, perhaps you'll want to talk to one of those pilots at Dover. They are at Dover today.
Col T: They are assigned to a fighter interceptor wing at Dover? Is that Dover, Delaware? Dover, Maryland?
Maj B: I believe it's Delaware sir, but I'm not certain.
Col T: Yes. What is the designation of their unit, do you know?
Maj B: It was 148th Fighter Interceptor Unit.

Pilot Says He Saw Odd Object 
Speed Over Coast at 900 M.P.H.

M/Sgt. Rollin S. Rogers, RM.,Air Force Base, reported the pilot sighting a mysterious object
about 900 miles an hour. 

The object disappeared after the pilot had followed it for about 3,000 feet at 1t.

The object did seem to be sinking to the level of the sea, and was moving in a southeasterly direction, 
said Lt. Wilbert S. Rogers, 23, attached to the Air Force base at Dover.

Lt. Rogers told officers here Lt. Rogers said: "I don't know whether it was a plane, rocket, or what, but I've never seen anything like it before."

The World War II veteran from Columbia, S.C., was reminded that various units of the armed forces have conducted down reports of flying objects which have since been explained as weather balloons.

Lt. Rogers couldn't have been a balloon, he said. "And besides, no balloon could have gone that fast."

What he and Capt. Ballard saw while flying in a T-33 jet trainer at an altitude of 20,000 feet at 1:30 p.m. yesterday was something utterly different, he declared. The object was below them at about 12,000 feet, going at a terrific speed. 

As they followed the object, it moved in at the from Sandy Hook, New jersey, then out to Asbury Park. The speed appeared constant.

STATEMENT

17 September 1951

While participating in a training flight from Dover AFB, Delaware, I sighted an object over Sandy Hook, New Jersey. I followed the object and observed its behavior until it disappeared. The object was a bright or a 1-2 type silver aircraft, similar to a T-33 type aircraft. It was about 30,000 feet in altitude, moving very fast and good on speed. The object was maneuverable, making turns and oscillations as it traveled. While Major Ballard was making his position report, I was following the object and continued to in a descending turn to the left. About 15 seconds after I first sighted the object, I saw and followed a contrail which I thought proceeded from the object. The object continued a port turn, disappearing out to the south of Arbury Park.
At no time from the first sighting until it disappeared did the object stop its movement. The object covered a distance of about 35 miles in approximately 90 seconds elapsed, with the object covering a distance of about 35 miles.
The size of the object was approximately 30 to 50 feet in diameter. The object was silver or metallic in color, had no exhaust trails, and appeared to be circular in shape. However, when I had the object in sight, it appeared to be circular in shape; however, at times the object could be said to be identical to a disc as is used in target practice. I could not say definitely whether or not the object was a disc or circular in appearance. The distance of the object could be said to be identical to a disc as is used in target practice.
At an altitude of about 8,000 feet over Sandy Hook, I watched the object and it appeared to be descending. When I first sighted, I would judge that it was between 30
to 50 feet in diameter. The object was silver or metallic in color, had no exhaust trails, and appeared to be circular in shape. However, when I had the object in sight, it appeared to be circular in shape; however, at times the object could be said to be identical to a disc as is used in target practice. I could not say definitely whether or not the object was a disc or circular in appearance. The distance of the object could be said to be identical to a disc as is used in target practice.
In our training and daily practice as intercept pilots, we must note accurately times which the object of the interrogation is first sighted. I did this automatically when I first sighted the object over Sandy Hook. Although we were on a direct course, I could see the object and immediately started to take action. The object seemed to be the same size to the left and vertical for it stayed at the same apparent size until it disappeared. At the time I called the radio check in, I called the object to the attention, and we both watched it though it was not on the scope until it covered approximately 20 miles and disappeared out to the east. The object appeared to be banking and its course described a gradual 90 degree turn to the left.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED 

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

AREA OR PLACE OF OBSERVATION: Sandy Hook, New Jersey
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 10 SEPTEMBER 1951
DATE OF INFORMATION: 21 SEPTEMBER 1951
PREPARED BY (OFFICE): COL BRUCE K. BAUMGARDNER, USAF

SUMMARY: 
On 10 September 1951, while conducting a training flight from Dover AFB, Delaware, the pilots spotted an unidentified object. The time was 1135 EDT, and the weather was CAVU. The object was at an estimated altitude of 8,000 feet, flying at 20,000 feet, and disappeared two minutes later.

The object was reported as being the size of an X-36 but much faster (500+ mph), diamond-shaped, steady in flight with no visible means of propulsion. 

At 1110 EDT, a radar station at Ft. Monmouth plotted an unidentified, high speed (above 700 mph) object in approximately the same location.

Headquarters has no information regarding natural phenomena, experimental aircraft, or guided missiles that could be identified with the observations. Request USAF evaluation of incident be furnished this headquarters.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

TR-52-32
On 10 September, Major Ballard of the 119th Fighter Interceptor Squadron spotted an unidentified object over Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Their F-51 aircraft was well above the object, which was moving southward. Lt. Rogers was first to sight the object (11:35 EDT) since Major Ballard was making a position report. 

Lt. Rogers followed the object in a diving turn to the left, descending to an altitude of about 8,000 feet with the object descending to about 6,000 feet below and to the left of the aircraft. Thereafter he tried to keep a course paralleling, but above, the object.

As soon as Major Ballard completed his radio check-in he was notified of the strange object. Both watched it make a 90 degree turn to the left and kept it under observation while it slowly disappeared to the southwest, before it disappeared entirely.

The object had been in sight for about two minutes with the object covering a distance of about 35 miles. Major Ballard had the object in sight for a minute as he was maneuvering and description of the object is attached.

On the same date a radar station at 95 ft. reported two targets that were unidentified, brightly lighted, and making high speed and erratic maneuvers. After refueling, Major Ballard stated that on his return to base the radar site was unable to relocate the targets. However, the probability of being inverted in speed and being inconsistent with known aircraft types could not be ignored. This fact and the fact that four such incidents are reported in two days. However, the probability of being inverted on reported results and results will admitted upon receipt.

AF FORM 112—PART II 
APPROVED I JUNE 1948

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

REPORT NO. IR-4-575

PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

1. All personnel listed in initial report from Pt. Monmouth were students, with the exception of the project engineer holder. They were all civilians, radar operators, since 1942 and stated he had no knowledge of a "flying saucer" report prior to observing the incident. This information was obtained during an interview made by him.

2. The item listed in paragraph 2, initial Pt. Monmouth report, was later identified as a balloon.

3. The radar pots at Ft. Monmouth were in first-class mechanical condition. However, the erratic behavior and "fluttering" nature of the target as described in the initial report indicates the strong possibility of occurrence of targets and/or aircraft.

4. At variance with paragraph 1. above, is the fact that the Pt. Monmouth PIO called the radar section on the morning of 10 September, stating that a "negative recall" was received by the PIO, but withdrewl the martial body with technical data concerning the observation.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, describing a field investigation conducted by Col. M. M. Rosengarten and Lt. J. W. Cummings between 27 September and 2 October 1951. The text summarizes the results of the investigation, which was prompted by a sighting at Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey on 10 and 11 September 1951. The document mentions electronic and visual means of unidentified flying objects and Col. Kirkland's desire to know more about the sighting. It also discusses the role of the Project Monitor or "Grudge" Project in extracting information from the files and Col. Kirkland's telephone call to Washington to determine if further action would be necessary.

The text found in the document is as follows:

16 October 1951

The purpose of the information recorded on this wire recording is to summarize results of a field investigation accomplished by Col M. M. Rosengarten and Lt J. W. Cummings between 27 September and 2 October 1951. The material recorded herein in chronological fashion although some organization will be introduced in handling the information derived from persons interrogated in Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey. The trip originated was a receipt at approximately 1400 at Air Technical Intelligence Center of Teletype No. 246, Telecon Item CSAF Item 2. This telecon was sent down from AFOIN-V/VTO.

The reported sightings on 10 September 1951 and on 11 September 1951 by electronic and visual means of unidentified flying objects. Col Kirkland had indicated such only in the morning on 2 October that Gen Cabell's office was desirous of knowing concerning a sighting at Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey. Therefore, the Project Monitor or "Grudge" Project extracted from the files information that had been received on the Ft. Monmouth sighting and related same to Col Kirkland. Now Col Kirkland made a telephone call to Washington and advised me to stand by that fast action would be necessary on this because of the General's personal interest. Therefore, a stenographer was alerted since it was expected that information might be received after working hours were completed or to work over would be accomplished. The mission indicated by Col Kirkland. However, no information reached us until 4 P.M., quiting time. At that moment, Mr. Dejarmond informed that a message had come in, that they had sought the Project Monitor and that discussion was being accomplished in Electronics Branch. Consequently, Col Rosengarten and Lt Cummings were dispatched to Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey.

Note: This is a full of ERRORS So use it Cautiously - ERRORS made in transcribing from wire.

Cummings accompanied by Mr. Deysrmond went to the Electronics Branch and learned that the stated telecon had arrived some yards in length and it was being discussed by Electronics Branch and Mr. Zimmerman. The decision was made soon after that meeting was broke up that we had been delayed already two hours and we might as well get into the field because information necessary for evaluation was not present in the communication from TCB, and that other information seemed likely to be had. The decision was then submitted by a request in the subject telecon for ATIC to make an evaluation of these incidents and to recommend a full investigation to obtain a complete report of the incident and related circumstances. Evaluation and conclusions should be forwarded to this HQ by teleconference. Immediate investigation must be made. Findings must be related immediately to this HQ not later than Monday, 1 October 1951, following information concerning these instances is quoted for preliminary analysis to be made immediately for Gen Cabell and then EADS, Hq, Stewart Air Force Base interrogations concerning radar and visual sightings are quoted. Now Col Kirkland was contacted and travel orders were written at a late hour in the evening so that Col Rouenjarter could proceed to 1st AF Command headquarters & TWA terminals New York at about 11:30 that night. About 10 o'clock on Saturday morning Lt Cummings and Col Rouenjarter reached Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey, and contacted their C-2 of the Signal Corps station, Ft. Monmouth. Arrangements were made to begin immediate interrogation of personnel concerning electronics sightings through the cooperation of C-2, Base Commander, acting through Col Murmann. The persons interrogated are as follows: Pfc Clark, Pvt Abelle, Pvt Allen, Pvt Mason, Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Meyer.

in preparation for becoming an instructor at Fort Monmouth where he is actually functioning in that capacity now. PFC Clark was operating an MPG type set MPG-1 and consequently his information and that of Mr. Meyers are somewhat more reliable scope than that of the students. No purpose seems to be served in detailing the results of the interrogations of these men but rather we will go at once to the items of CSAF Item No. 2 in order to discuss the influence of the interrogations on the material presented in these items. The teleconferences held on September 1, September 10, 1951, September 11, 1951, and September 13, 1951, are the basic material presented in these items. This set picked up a fast moving low flying target. This is under the operation of PFC Clark at that time. PFC Clark was operating the set unattended at that time. This set has a nominal range of 12 to 14,000 yds., the set is geared in azimuth using a compass so that 0° for a set in azimuth is magnetic north field approximately with experimental error of the situation may set it upon. PFC Clark was making a demonstration for some visiting non-technical officers at the time he observed Item No. 1. It was his intention to obtain a target to look the target in on automatic non-aided tracking in order to demonstrate this feature as soon as he started the demonstration of finding a saturation echo on a PPI scope with almost constant target heading, on attempting to look in a aided tracking. However, he was considerably frustrated by the fact that the aided tracking would not keep up with the object. After several attempts to maintain aided tracking of this target, he determined that the speed was too high for aided tracking of about 700 mph. Because of the circumstances of the demonstration quickly tried to pass to another target and was finally successful in demonstrating a ground target, namely, the Highlands which lie between the station and his point of observation.

Transcribed text:

Interrogator regarded anomalous propagation involving trapping effects and gave negative indications and was verified by other personnel. Weather shows that September 10 in that area was not one favoring anomalous propagation but the September 11 was. Evidence by FPS Guard that ground clutter was of a normal nature and was not extending inside of 5,000 yds. Prior 3 centimeters set of the MPG type or others were in operation in the area at that station to the knowledge FPC Clark and other personnel there which eliminates interference effects. Note that no pip shape may be discussed here in order to fix the current size of target because of the use of the PPI scope alone and aided tracking was not possible. FPC Clark began operation on this instance at approximately 11:15 and the operation was ended by 11:18 approximately. This is approximately 3 seconds at one time although 45 seconds in a row. It could not be verified 10 September 1951 was fixed in the telecom, however, the student with reference to other events would fix this as 11 September or 12 September.  This is given a low evaluation. It is believed, in fact it was on September 10. The MPG set had been in operation since 1100, that is warming up, for 15 minutes before the demonstration began in which the target was picked. This story interrogation by FPC Clark was high altitude target traveling north bound up the Jersey course from Belmont. It was lost near Sandy Hook, he said. Following the course line changing the range only slightly but changing azimuth rapidly. The target was lost in the northeast at a range of 14,400 yds. Operator initially identified the target as a ship and then realized it could not be a ship. FPC Clark upon interrogation stated that he intended to say operator found a target near location of ship is usually found and realized it was not a ship.

Reference paragraph 2 stating on 10 September 1951, 1515 hours AMCR 584, shortly before the track-target, etc. It is given an A-l evaluation, that this radar observed a balloon target at 32,000 feet altitude, accompanied by an officer of the Student Attachment to determine the altitude in order to establish who was a pool concerning what the altitude of the balloon which is sighted might be. The pool was formed by several officers at a risk of $1 a head concerning this target. It is a significant feature here which ties in later with the discussion of balloons.

Paragraph 3: On 11 September 1951 at 1030 hours, two SCR 584 serial sets 217 and 212 picked up the same target at a range of 100 to 300 miles of 30,000 yds. etc. The interesting feature of this sighting is that it was observed by MIT which was a radar to investigate.

The document further mentions Mr. Meyer the instructor previously mentioned and Pvt Mason, the MIT graduate, previously mentioned. Pvt Mason and a crew of two other men were training in a radar set which was in operation at the particular moment just prior to the signal received at 1030 hours. The instructor, Mr. Meyer, was involved in this incident.

advised that he should put all sets into watch in the search in order to
watch for unidentified flying objects. In order to do this, he had another
instructor point out directly to his students and advise them that they should
search at once for unidentified flying objects. Pvt Mason and the other two men
were among the students who were notified. Another instructor went directly to Cpl
SAz just before it was put on the air. It had previously been warned by that morning.
Almost at once Pvt Mason and his crew announced to Mr. Meyer that they had a
target high speed and strong. Mr. Meyer investigated and observed the target
himself on the scope, noticed the azimuth and went directly to set 217 searched
in the proper azimuth for the same target and soon succeeded in finding it.
Indication of a target of greater than B-29 size generally of the B-29 size
interrupted distinguished from a B-36 size aircraft. Mr. Meyer had personally
trained on several occasions and could distinguish, he said, from a balloon
stating that it was definitely not a balloon he had in the scope. Target
first appeared at 00 azimuth and varied 250 to 50 in azimuth. During turns
the pip would diminish in the manner which was characteristic of jet aircraft
at that range. He put the scope on tracking because they would keep the
target in aided tracking by assisting the operation by applying torque to
the hand wheel. G-2 Counterintelligence whose age is 31, is at least a B reliability.
He is cleared for Secret, however, other weather information showed existence of
fronts lying out from fort Monmouth in such a manner with the radar lead
jactrag downwards would give signals somewhat like the type observed. It is
not an evaluation. There is not sufficient data from which to make an evaluation.

There is no photograph present in this image. The document appears to be a Project Blue Book report providing details about an incident involving Pvt. Mason and his crew, and Pvt. Allen and his crew, related to a "rigid detail and routine to which they are subjected". The report discusses the difficulties the students were having with their training program, and provides details about the incident where Pvt. Allen was operating a set alone and identifying a target. The report concludes that the situation was too confused to make any definite findings, and that weather could have had an effect on the target.

solicited from Pvt Mason and his crew due to the difficulties of time having elapsed and the students being confused by their training program, speaking specifically of a rigid detail and routine to which they are subjected. This should not be construed to be a criticism in that their technical capabilities seem to be unusually great for students showing that their training course is likely a good one. Notice that paragraphs 3 of these communication indicates two unrelated reports. Pvt Mason and his crew are identified with No. 4, SGR Serial No. 315. Mr. Meyer identified with this Serial No. 217, Item 3. Now it is proper to discuss SGR Set Serial No. 315 of Item 3 identifying this was Pvt Allen and his crew. Pvt Allen, Pvt Abello of this crew were interrogated. It developed that Pvt Allen was operating the set alone at the time he picked up the signal. He did not relate the information that morning to his fellow students but instead that rather waited until that afternoon. Although they were within easy hearing distance at the time he identified the target on the scope, the situation is too confused again in this instance to state specifically any findings. It may be concluded, however, that weather could have had a definite effect upon this target as well. Some question may be introduced concerning why Pvt Allen would fail immediately to notify his fellow members of such an unusual target had he seen it and indeed not mention it during the lunch but wait until that afternoon in order to be questioned in an evaluation again. There is not sufficient data to arrive at a conclusion. The time to be ascribed to paragraph 3 should be approximately 1037 EDST. Investigation of the student personnel occupied Saturday, Saturday night, and Sunday morning and part of Sunday afternoon. Much time was spent attempting to fix the difficulties that had been encountered.

with greater detail dates, time, and circumstances in order to find something
of value. However, it was realized after all this was accomplished, it had been
in vain, absolutely too much time had elapsed for human memory to recover the
detail necessary for further evaluation. Then, the two pilots, Major Ballard
flying as observer, and Lt. Rogers, who was flying as pilot, of a T-33 sighted
an unidentified flying object and they were flown to Fort Monmouth for interrogation.
The story was verified, questioned, analyzed, discussed, and the pilots remained
firmly convinced of the details which they had sighted. However, certain circumstances were indications that they did not possess the detail which they
claimed concerning a track or the flying object they claimed to have seen. They
were interrogated at great length concerning the circumstances whereby this
report concerning the flying object they saw reached the press and also a
request for an investigation of the base per Captain Legters, Intelligence
officer at Mitchell Air Force Base, a Major Barren, in order to clarify his
part in the activity. It is sufficient to state that neither Ballard or Rogers
made a voluntary statement to press and that Rogers made his statement to the
press only when he was directed to do so by Major Barren, Base PIO, and this
is according to Rogers statement only. An interrogation of the personnel at
Twin Lights Radar Station was undertaken and it was learned that Twin Lights
was under the direct observation of the 112th Signal Section at that time and
and under flight lights are referred to as referring to our operating lights and
that the time at Twin Lights were 0800 to 9300 and 1700 to 2300 BST. Therefore,
there is no verification from Twin Lights loss of the sighting one way or
the other. However, Staff Sgt Pallock who was monitoring channel fox at the

Item No. 2 of the telecon of 28 September 1951 will show the names of Clark, Abelle, Mason, and Myer. These individuals were concerned with operations of radar stations from which signals were seen on 10 and 11 September. The significant fact learned at Fort Monmouth was that the students were operating radar sets in a training center that these students were not connected with practical operations. They maintained no plotting records and they did not plot and did not know of the existence of the training installations. Circumstances were handled that as a students ago were being trained for maintenance at this training facility and that an instructor put certain mechanical or electronic difficulties into radar sets of the SCR 584-A Type. The students were charged for determining the malfunction causes and eliminating these causes. If the students were successful in eliminating the causes and peaking their set to higher radiation efficiencies, early in their phase of the program associated with these sets, they were permitted to operate the sets much the same as a tactical operation for training or for certain types of incidental testing which was not confined to a particular circular areas in connection with the following interest in stations in that these students were assigned to such sets and these three students were required to operate alone, not providing a man for allowing or coordinating by plots. It was considered incidentally desirable by the students to operate the sets as a sort of privilege and they attempted to do this whenever possible.

station overhead a radio check and conversation between the pilots which is discussed in detail in other reports enclosed in the folder. He reports that the conversation was an exciting one and verified roughly the statements Rogers and Ballard made concerning what they revealed over the air. He fixed the time as only about 11:45 PEST and could not fix the date. He is curious about his personnel. He is checked for secrets. Dr. Bennett was queried concerning possible activities of a countermeasure station in which he works which might have an effect of giving spurious signals to radar sets operating in the area. His answer to these proposals were unqualified negative. He was interrogated by Col Rosengarten and his report is filed in the project folder. Mr. Hoffman, Capt McNicholas, Agent DeBoer, Agent-in-Chief Reid, were all interrogated concerning the circumstances of events which were available in the project's record folder. Major Martin is Commanding Officer of Twin Lights and gave the information of the hours of which the station was on the air. With some seven hours of sleep, and one or two meals, the Redbanks pparting, that is Col Rosengarten and Lt Cummings chartered an airplane at Redbanks Airport for Washington, D. C. at approximately 1:30 P.M. reaching Washington at approximately 3:30 P.M. in time to brief Gen. Cabell's staff and to give a very preliminary random of what had been accomplished, to Gen. Cabell himself that evening. The airplane was chartered because although the Signal Corps attempts to use their liason airplane to take us to Washington, the liason airplane was torn down for periodic inspection. It would have been necessary to wait until the next day had rail or other transportation been used.

Work continued in Washington and Gen. Gabell wanted to be briefed on Tuesday in detail. We checked with Col Kirkland and learned that he wished us to leave behind in Washington as short and incomplete a record as possible pending our firm commitment to Washington as a power of center commitment in order to study the data in detail. This we were successful in accomplishing. We did have the work in Washington on Tuesday morning and afternoon in order to determine the possibility for balloon and experimental aircraft situations as the incident reported. Balloon results were, until after we left Washington, negative as were experimental aircraft possibilities. Agencies contacted with this respect were Gen Mills, a Mr. Delcin in Minneapolis, Minn., a Mrs. Whiting of the Signal Corps Research Development Center in Washington, Dr. Lincoln La Paz, Head of the Office of Naval Research and others incidental in discovering the identity of these project monitors. The weather bureau was contacted for the weather report. Command Post personnel were contacted to determine whether any reports from the Eastern Air Defense Command might have reported any sightings which we did not have. These results were negative. Persons contacted includes: Col Lamber, Eastern Air Defense Command, ACMI Officer, at the Pentagon; Col Garland, Army Chemical Center Commanding Officer, Lt Col Hubbell, Command 25th Engineers and personnel in the message centers. The following conclusions were left with General Gabell: His staff, Hartford and Jax, and qualified to them as particularly preliminary conclusions. Reference to the telecom message again OSAF Item 2, paragraph 1, we have nothing to the moment. We are attempting to get more.

basic information which applies possibly in with the airborne sighting.
Paragraph No. 2 (a) 1 balloon because:
a. Constant altitude.
b. Slow variation in azimuth.
c. Visual observation about the same time at the same altitude 
by a group of officers.
d. Motive or cause to the cause for search for that balloon was estab-
lished as an order from the Commanding Officer of the student attachment.
e. Pip size checks with balloons.

3. Target echoes as described bear the characteristics which closely
resemble aircraft. It is based on what we have now. We can't add anything
negative. Although it resembles an aircraft, it is not impossible that it
is caused by weather phenomena. It is of blimp waves.

4. Whether possibility exists as follows:
a. Stationary target when first detected giving rapid altitude
change offers us one solution that fits.
b. It is to be qualified, however, that weather is not as plausible
an explanation of a track of 10,000 yds. continuously at 700/mph over south
to 32,000 yds. range. It is to be mentioned however, that more accurate
experienced observations than those of the students would be required to
identify any points of similarity in the actual appearance of aircraft return.
Students were able to yield primarily only information concerning the motions
of the pip. However, as most preliminary conclusions offered this staff, the
airborne sighting of 1st Lt Rogers and Major Ballard follows:

There is no photograph in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page describes details of a reported UFO sighting, including information about the object's size, shape, color, and speed, as well as the pilots' observations and conclusions.

The text in the document is as follows:

There are counter-indications that it is an attempt by these two officers to gain publicity in that transmission by the pilot to Sansworth were monitored by Twin Lights and it was definitely reported by the monitor that the pilots were excited in describing something which they believed to exist in the sky. A ground chart was established by reference to interrogation a chart made by airborne by Lt Rogers. It is believed that the ground chart which he recorded on that map is correct as the pilots consider it. No statement was made as to whether the pilots are correct but only as they consider it. The range involved cross-section by observation from greater altitude against geographic points on the ground. Upper limited range could thereby be established. A size was reported 30 to 50 ft. in diameter as no fixed or reliable value. Lt Rogers will admit a larger size even up to B-17 dimensions. As to speed, Rogers and Ballard would not fix a value. They quote only their ground track against the sighting time that is 30 to 50 nautical miles in about two minutes. This shape oblated spheroid the color silver. There were no more observations which we could offer the staff. At the time of this recording, conclusions are something as follows: From the interrogation of Lt Rogers, the T-33 pilot, (a) the object was circular in shape changing other banked to elliptical shape the object bank in turning. (b) The object was silver in color. Pilot was firm that the object did not reflect the sunlight brightly. (c) The object covered 35 to 50 miles during a two minute period of observation. Conclusion: That with an allowance for misinterpretation, the object makes good speeds greater than 700/mph. (d) The object cannot be fixed for size except within the lower range.

bound of 35 ft diameter and upper bound of B-17 diameter. (a) The time of sighting was 11:35 EDST and the object was lost at 11:37 EDST, on 10 September 1951. However, all the foregoing observations concerning the conclusions from the interrogation of Lt Rogers are in the assumption that it is impossible to demonstrate criteria necessary to establish their sighting as one of a balloon. Now these criteria are considered to be something like the following: 
a. Opportunity - that is the presence of a balloon in that geographic area.
b. Similarity - that is points of similarity between balloons and observations made.
c. Absence of a negative component - that is, the pilots themselves verified on a balloon or the subjects who were viewing from the ground did not see a balloon. However, this could be elaborated upon. 
It is believed that essentially that these factors would effect the decision. 
Now as to opportunity, we have information that the Evans Signal Laboratory released two balloons at 11:12 EDST 10 September, that these balloons were in the air until 12:32 EDST on 10 September and that they burst at 104,000 ft and the diameter of the balloons at burst were 35 ft approximately. It is to be noted that between Signal Laboratory at Belmar, N.J. and the location regarding points of similarity the following must be considered:
Considering that the pilots disagreed radically, interrogations or Lt 2 of the EADF and interrogations by ATIC personnel as in their written statements concerning ground tract that they are not sure or more than this fact that the

The image appears to contain a photograph of two objects in the sky. The text describes the objects as always being on the left side of the T-33 aircraft and following a course such that they are always leading the aircraft. The text indicates that the objects may be a stationary balloon inside the turning circle of the aircraft. The text also discusses the difficulty in determining the ground track and altitude of the objects based on the observations.

object was always on their left and that they did not or did assume a parallel heading. Mathematically speaking, this is to say that the object was going in
the same direction as the T-33 aircraft was turning and that the object is following
a course such that it is always leading the aircraft, that is, out of phase with
it. So that the object is travelling in phase inside the circle of the aircraft,
and indeed that if may even be stationary inside the circle of the aircraft.
It is to be noted that the interpretation that the object always lay on the left 
of the pilot may be that the object was a balloon stationary inside their turning
circle. It is also to be noted that the pilots are not sufficiently sure of
the ground track to negate this and a calculation concerning what the altitude
of a balloon must be are unnecessary and impossible in that the accuracy of the
pilots report is so extremely questionable. In fact there is indication
that they cannot fix the alleged ground track of the object within 10 nautical
miles. Note that in terms of speed, this means ten nautical miles in two minutes
or five nautical miles per minute or 300 knots per hour if one takes the extreme
error between the two observations of ground tract. A point of similarity is
that balloons are silvery painted for radar purposes when released from Evans
Signal Laboratory. So reconn was reported by the pilots. A point of similarity
is the shape viewed under proper circumstances that the balloon might have an
oblique spherical shape. In the light of this information, it is considered
that there is a strong possibility that the sighting was that of a balloon. How-
ever, if it can be disproved without recourse to metaphysics what the object was not
a balloon, then it should be considered that the four conclusions presented pre-
viously are essentially those which we can stand firmly upon.

Following is a transcript of the text in the document:

Following is a project transcript of an interrogation of T. S. Elliott, Pilot Interceptor Sq., Delaware. The interrogation was conducted by Sgt. J. R. Donahue, USAAF, on 29 Sept., 1951.

The subject's sighting occurred while airborne near Sandy Hook, New Jersey.

Also these men had been previously interviewed by the investigators. In coverage to establish the fact that the object sighted could not have been any known aerial devices, the information obtained shows that:

1. The object was quite silent, and the interrogation available to the investigators was verified as a real and concrete by the witnesses.

2. The question of communication or the information as examined reflects no satisfactory explanation. 

3. Observations of the object coviered a period of more than fifteen minutes.

(GPA-3) became aware of the existence of a fast flying object and investigated. Lt. Rogers to Maj. Ballard was transmitted over a radio conversation that there was an unidentified object moving at a very rapid speed. It was determined that this time the airspeed was 600 to 700 mph.

This incident is believed to be solved by a possible unknown balloon flight, but definitive information regarding the identity of the object is not conclusive. However, inasmuch as this is not certain, may have been a flight of test craft which are known to the Air Material Command to have a high speed capability.

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically document 1951-09-7009027 from Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The page contains no visible photograph, only text describing a report of an unidentified aircraft sighting.

The text of the document is as follows:

"9. The officers advised Col Sprauis and Col Spain, operations officers, regarding the incident. The officers stated that they had seen a very high speed unidentified aircraft and were not able to determine its exact actions. Their only response was laughter. The time, 12:20, approximately, 10 Sept 1951.

The pilot stated that he had followed this aircraft for 10 to 15 figures, while this was from a slow speed of 190 mph to a speed above the horizon, and was first seen identifying himself as Major Barron, public information officer, and stated he could not locate this aircraft, as officers stated to him over the telephone at a designated location, ground track, description, time of sighting, duration, etc.

However, the officer allegedly did no qualify himself, except as follows:

He then reported that Lt. Colonel Willcoxon stated story never actually got over to operations to confirm the story from Lt. Rogers. He stated he was clarifying by identifying and establishing the individual who was to report this incident, as Major Barron, public information officer. Lt. Rogers' report would be at "Mitchell" and he was told some hours later.

A man in civilian clothes (description not recalled) entered operations and stated he was also interested in the incident, and wanted to know the particulars. He was later identified as a Lt. Colonel, and did not authentically show credentials.

The civilian informed himself as follows: he was sent by the colonel to get the information on the incident, for the colonel, and did not show any credentials. The civilian introduced himself as Major Barron, and stated that he had been" [remainder of text cut off].
