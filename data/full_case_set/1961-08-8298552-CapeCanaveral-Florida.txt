A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ELIMINATING THE
POSSIBILITY OF WEATHER BALLOONS, TEST AIRCRAFT, HELICOPTERS
AND OTHER PHENOMENA WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR THIS SIGHTING. ALL
RESULTS HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE. THE ONLY POSSIBILITY WHICH HAS NOT
BEEN ELIMINATED IS THAT OF THE OBJECT BEING A METEORITE IN VIEW.

PAGE TWO RESUME OF METEORITE ACTIVITY THE NIGHT OF THE SIGHTING.
THIS POSSIBILITY CAN NOT BE COMPLETELY ELIMINATED. HOWEVER, THE DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT, THE FACT THAT IT HAD NO TAIL OR TRAIL OR DESCRIBE TO BURNING AND THE OBSERVER'S ESTIMATE THAT THE OBJECT WAS AT A 1,222 FOOT ALTITUDE AND NO MORE THAN 2 TO 3 MILES FROM HIM MAKES THIS ANALYSIS UNLIKELY. le HONE.
