Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets if necessary.

Being of a rather startling nature, I felt this incident should be reported to the proper authorities, namely the C.0. at hill. and field, to which the object was headed and which seemed the logical place to report it. However, after considering the matter, I felt that since the object appeared to be moving away from the base, and in view of the fact that the entire incident was seen only by myself, it would perhaps create unnecessary alarm to report it. Therefore, I am merely recording it here in the event that similar incidents should come to light through other sources.
