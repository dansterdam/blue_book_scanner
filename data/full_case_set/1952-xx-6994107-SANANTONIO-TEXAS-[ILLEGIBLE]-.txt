As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

1. At approximately 1100 hours, 25 July 1952, the Flight Intelligence Office at Randolph Air Force Base was notified by phone that an unidentified object had been observed over the San Antonio area. The object was reported to be in sight for some minutes, and according to the witness, was flying at a high rate of speed and at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. The object was lost to sight and was not seen again. 

2. The interrogation revealed that an unusual light of very high intensity was seen by AIC Pratt who was on duty in the Randolph Central Tower during the night of 25 July 1952. The object described was a light of brilliant intensity, apparently some distance away, which appeared across to the southwest at an angle of about 40 to 50 degrees from the horizontal, remained stationary for several minutes, and then disappeared rapidly. It was observed to be a steady light, neither blinking nor pulsating, and was estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. AIC Pratt was unable to determine its exact location or size, but stated that it seemed to be a considerable distance away. He was unable to observe any details of shape or structure, as the light was of such brilliant intensity that it obscured any such details. He was unable to observe any trail or exhaust, nor could he hear any sound associated with the object. He was unable to determine its exact time of appearance or disappearance, as he was absorbed in another task at the time. 

3. The object was first sighted at 0033, Central Standard Time, on 25 July 1952. It was observed for approximately 5 to 7 minutes. No sound was heard, and no trail or exhaust was visible. The object appeared to be motionless and at one point appeared to be slightly larger than a star. The pilot of the C-47, whose report was received earlier, stated that his sighting occurred about 30 minutes later than the sighting by AIC Pratt. The pilot's report stated that the object was of a brilliant white color, with a distinct reddish-orange glow around the perimeter. The pilot estimated the object's altitude to be approximately 30,000 feet, and stated that it appeared to be much larger than a star. The pilot further stated that the object remained stationary for some time, and then suddenly disappeared at a very high rate of speed.

1. A civilian female's manner of observation was visual from the surface. From the surface the observer located the object, which was flashing, and claimed it was onknow by any authority.

2. The observer, located in the Randolph Air Force base control tower, was controlling an aircraft at the time. He observed the object at 9:55 (55) degrees. This sighting was determined by the fact that the tower operator pointed out the object to the pilot of the aircraft under his control, and the pilot concurred in the observation.

3. V/C Walter D. Watts, Lt, 13-KCCCH, is a control tower operator. This was the first time he had ever seen anything like it. He is very familiar with all types of aircraft, conventional and jet. He stated he had never seen anything like it before. The object was described as being about 45 degrees up, larger than a star, flashing on and off, and moving very slowly. He estimated its size as being approximately two and one-half times the diameter of a B-29 propeller. The observer will attest to his report.

7. The weather at San Antonio during the sighting was clear, visibility fifteen miles, surface winds southwest at seven (7) knots.

8. The investigation by the District Office Randolph AFB was recorded in their official log. It appears a detailed check of the Randolph weather data and a thorough check of the aircraft control center records on the date was made. No further information was uncovered to warrant a formal air technical intelligence investigation. The project BLUE BOOK record of this incident includes only a very brief summary noting the date, location, and such limited details as were reported in the initial report.

9a. No negatives were ever obtained and no photographs taken.

10. Identification or classification action was taken other than the recording of a routine "Unidentified" report and the initiation of this brief follow-up check at the local level, without further information or development.

11. The traffic in the immediate area was one (1) D-28 Laminar training aircraft, serial 2, Randolph AFB, in the landing pattern, about the time of the sighting.

COMMENTS TO: REPORTING OFFICER

The reporting officer's report was submitted promptly through channels to this headquarters. However, no further investigation or information on this particular sighting was developed by this headquarters. The object observed was reported to have definite characteristics and to have been witnessed by a control tower operator very familiar with aircraft. No photographs were obtained, however, and the lack of physical evidence or data precluded anything more than the recording of the incident as "Unidentified" in project files.

CERTIFICATE

I, Leroy D. Pratt, Airman First Class, AT 1524,019 assigned to the 3510th Provbing Air Force Base, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, do hereby certify that the following statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

On 6 July 1952, while engaged in the routine air navigation and map trainer exercise as a student pilot of a T-33 class aircraft at Laughlin Air Force Base, Del Rio, Texas, I made the following observations:

At 0930 hours on the 26th of July, a T-33 type aircraft, serial number 51-4217, was observed above me at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet, heading in an easterly direction. After this aircraft passed, I observed two unidentified objects, silver in color and circular in shape, in the same general area. These objects were traveling in a north to south direction at an indicated speed of approximately 600-700 mph. At that time, I notified the control tower of my observation, requesting information from the pilot of the T-33 concerning the light phenomenon I had just witnessed. It was ascertained from the pilot that he had also observed these same unidentified objects, and was unable to explain them.

I then contacted my squadron commander, Capt. J.L. Gonzalez, and advised of the situation. Capt. Gonzalez stated that the objects appeared to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, and were quite unlike any aircraft he had previously seen or heard about. He further stated that he would make an immediate report to the Intelligence Officer at San Antonio General Hospital, and advise the C.I.C. of the situation.

After advising CALL, I then notified the A.C. of the tower, and he came to the tower at approximately 1030 hours.

In the interview that followed, the C-47 had continued his pursuit to 19,000 feet, and had advised operations that he had lost contact with the unidentified objects, despite his best efforts. The C-47 pilot stated that the objects were brilliant, metallic in appearance, and rather elliptical. It continued to climb and disappear rapidly.

All control advised that they had a definite "blip" on their radar scopes and a precise plot on the altitude and position of the object. When the "blip" disappeared from the radar scope, the observer on the ground, counter-clockwise turning and descending to a landing, until contact was lost at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet.

The 2-minute appearance and disappearance of this "blip" on the radar scope, plus the visual observation, fully conforms with the pilot's description of the metallic, elliptical objects.

There is no photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book document. The image appears to be a typed report with text describing an incident involving an object spotted by Captain T. S. Fyson, 1256th USAF Pilot, over San Antonio, Texas on 6 November 1952.

OCR Text:

12-21-52 

I was unable at any time to estimate either the altitude or distance of the object from the field due to my not knowing the intensity of the light.

Radar at Detail Control, under supervision of Captain Horwatt, determined the position of the object as one line as bearing from the field at a bearing of 261 degrees magnetic.

To the best of my recollection the C-47 was Captain T. S. Fyson, 1256th USAF Pilot, Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. Captain Horwatt was in the 1252nd AC & W Squadron. The assistant navigator was WOJG Simmons, USAF Detachment, Kelly Air Force Base.

We observed the object for approximately 30 minutes, weather being clear with 15 miles visibility. My final report to the control center was at 0237 hours, 23 July 1952.

UFOs BEING REPORTED AT RAPD FLYING SAUCER

These objects were observed twice during the evening of 6 Nov 52, seen about 10 minutes each time, apparently circling around RAPD and seemed to disappear at 10 p.m.
When first observed by two students and an instructor, objects appeared at 7:30 p.m. flying in a circular motion, climbing rapidly and disappearing at 140 degrees elevation. 
At 9:50 p.m. objects were again observed by tower operator, climbing rapidly and disappearing overhead.
This is the first sighting of this nature reported at RAPD.

Aircraft # 2603, a T-33, departed Kelly Air Force Base at 0043 hours. While in the air, the pilot and observer noticed an object in the sky which they were unable to identify. They were concerned over a sighted object in the vicinity and we notified a third person. They were concerned over a sighted object in the sky.

Randolph Tower mentioned something about flying saucers so we decided to investigate.

The object gave off a bright light and gave the appearance of rapid movement as we flew toward it. We climbed to an altitude of 13,500 feet at which point the object disappeared behind clouds. We climbed it to 18,500 feet at which point the navigator informed the object had disappeared.

Meanwhile, radar control joined with Randolph Tower in observation. We transmitted them our confirmation as to the point location of the object. However, their radar could not pick up the object. Based on their instructions, we flew intersections on the suspects but were unable to locate them as they had no more targets, so we returned to our routine mission.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
