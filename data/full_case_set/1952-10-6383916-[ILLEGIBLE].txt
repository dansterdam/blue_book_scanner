The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a newspaper clipping or document describing a sighting of a "Lighted Craft" by an astronomy class at the Central Ohio observatory. The text describes the craft as a "strange object" that was observed soaring through the sky, moving rapidly back and forth. Several students and the observatory director observed the craft, which they described as having a "angular speed" and moving in a "southwesterly" direction. The document states that the craft could not be identified conclusively, but the observers estimated its speed to be around 10 lights per minute.

A STRANGE OBJECT
Lighted Craft Sighted
By Astronomy Class
BY PAUL GAPP
A strange object bearing eight to 10 lights was observed soaring through the Central Ohio skies at Perkins Observatory Monday night.
Several astronomy students saw the phenomenon. They were taking part in a weekly obser
vation period.
Allen I. Hynek, assistant dean of the
Ohio State University Graduate School, said the students were carefully instructed and knew what to look for. However, he added, the object could not be conclusively identified.
The students at the observatory first noticed the lights about 7:50 p.m., said Hynek. He added that the craft was visible for several minutes, its lights blinking on and off at an "angular speed" of several degrees a minute.
Hynek said the students calculate the miles-per-hour speed, since the distance of the craft could not be determined. This is not readily done, he said, because the true distance was not known.
The object was not trailed in the observatory cameras, which were in use at the time, closely watched for several minutes.

The shared image does not contain a photograph, but rather text describing a meteor sighting witnessed by the crew of the Liberian S.S. Ulysses on October 11, 1952. The text provides details about the meteor's appearance, trajectory, and visibility.

METEORS

The Hydragraphic Office is cooperating with astronomers in studying meteors. Determinations of their number, size, color, time of appearance and disappearance are essential as clues to their orbits, and relationship to the earth's atmosphere. Complete data regarding their direction of drift are of special importance, as they determine wind direction in the upper atmosphere.

NORTH ATLANTIC

Capt. — — — of the Liberian S.S. Ulysses, reports that at 22:19 G.M.T. on October 11, 1952, while on a voyage from Puerto la Cruz to Philadelphia, he observed a brilliant meteorite traversing the heavens from west to east with tremendous speed. It flightened up the whole sky with a bluish-green light which gradually diminished until the object disappeared in the east 4 seconds.
Wind E. by S. very good visibility, air temperature 82° F.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 
TR-06-523
PAGE 1 OF 1

On the night of October 14, 1952, at 6:35 p.m., I was sighting on a sideboard, tracking an object and I saw two other craft and it is my belief they were also tracking the same object. This object had a peculiar motion, which was up and down, left and right, and very fast, then it would hang motionless, and then take off at a terrific speed. 

2. It made a zigzag motion, which is a typical characteristic of the following items: Geese - no, Planes - yes, Helicopters - no, Falling Stars - no, Guided Missiles - no, Jet Exhaust - no, Meteorites - no, Flares - no. This zigzag motion is well known to be indicative of guided objects of a nature not yet fully explained.

3. The object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, from 600 to 800 miles an hour, and from an altitude of 20,000 to 25,000 feet. It was visible for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.

4. The object appeared to be a dark, metallic color and did not reflect the sun's rays as a metallic object would do. It did not leave any vapor trail or smoke trail.

5. There was no sound whatsoever from the object during the entire sighting.

6. The wind was very slight and did not affect the motion of the object.

7. The wind was not a factor in the sighting, as the object traveled in a direction opposite to the wind.

8. The visibility was excellent and the object was clearly visible against the sky.

9. Because of the peculiar motion and the high rate of speed, I am convinced that this was not an ordinary aircraft, but was some type of guided missile or other aerial device not yet fully recognized or explained.

10. Because of the position that I was in when sighting the object, I was able to get a very good look at it and observe its peculiar motion in detail.

11. The address of the house where the sighting occurred is given below.
