PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 5 June 1966 07/0900-0930
2. LOCATION: Rolling Wisconsin
3. SOURCE: Civilian 
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Three
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5 MINUTES
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: To the SE
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION: There is no reason why the sighting could not have been three satellites. Observers' descriptions and qualities similar to those of satellites passing overhead, but seeing three in that location is rather unusual. Detailed film, trail, tail, or exhaust noted. All objects were traveling in a southeasterly direction.
