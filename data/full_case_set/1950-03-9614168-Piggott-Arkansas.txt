I apologize, but I do not see any photographs in this document. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing text instructions and guidelines related to radar sightings. 

Text from the document:

GUIDE TO INVESTIGATION (Cont'd)
Relative to Radar Sightings
1. Re Radars now operating on ground
a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size of targets;
b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (180 degrees), etc., and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not observable, how long did the target stay in the turn and what was its speed?
c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into several targets upon approach.
d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent with size of objects; faint; pulsating at regular rate?
e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?
2. If airborne, when object was sighted:
a. Were there any radar indications or extra noise on radio circuits?
b. Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc.
GENERAL
1. Teletype sequences of local weather conditions: SEE ATTACHED EXHIBIT
2. Winds aloft report: SEE ATTACHED EXHIBIT
a. Adiabatic chart for period in question: SEE ATTACHED EXHIBIT
3. Local flight schedules of commercial, private, and military aircraft flying in vicinity at the time: (Check Canadian activity if close to border.)
NOT AVAILABLE
4. Possible releases of testing devices in vicinity sent aloft by Ordnance Navy, Air Force, Army, Weather Units. (For release and tract of lighted asynoptic balloon and other information), SEARCH ORGANIZATIONS FOR ANY OTHERS.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document that describes an observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) made on March 14, 1950 in Piggott, Arkansas.

The text in the document is as follows:

March 24, 1950

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

I hereby make the following statement of my own free will.

On Tuesday afternoon, March 14, 1950, about 4:00 P.M., I was standing in front of my service station in Piggott, Arkansas. I looked up and saw a four-motored airplane, believed to be a transport. The plane banked and made a complete circle. Then, I saw an object, other than the plane, in the sky. It was above the plane, in altitude, and looked like a one hundred pound sack of potatoes in size. The color of the object was white or aluminum. The object appeared to be eight thousand (8,000) feet in altitude and at a sixty (60) degree angle on the horizon. It was approximately seventy (70) degrees clockwise from the north and drifting from west to east, almost due east. It remained in view approximately ten (10) minutes.
