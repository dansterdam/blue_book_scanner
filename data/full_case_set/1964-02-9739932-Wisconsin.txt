Summary report

On February 12, 1964, from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. a commercial airline pilot who was flying at 28,000 feet over central Wisconsin observed a brilliant bluish-white light maneuver in front of and below his aircraft.

The object was larger than a star and moved rapidly from left to right at a high rate of speed. It then appeared to pause for a few seconds, then abruptly reversed direction and returned to its original position. This maneuver was repeated several times.

The pilot reported the sighting to the Milwaukee Air Route Traffic Control Center. He was advised that the object was not being tracked on radar. The pilot was unable to take any photographs of the object.

This report was forwarded to Project Blue Book for evaluation. After investigating the sighting, Project Blue Book concluded that the object was a meteor or some other astronomical phenomenon. The case was classified as Unidentified.

Text transcribed from the document:

"It would then seem to corroborate his story, were it not for the fact that I had some doubts about his reliability and was not quite certain that in this case he had not been stretching the facts a bit. Naturally he claimed he could substantiate his story and was quite willing to have it investigated further."

"I backfired did not receive the report from him promptly, and am now recollecting some secondary details. At any rate I dispatched a brief phone call to those people within a day or so, but they did not seem to recall the incident clearly."

"Those people, whenever I talk to them again, I would be inclined to get a total recount of the incident from their own fresh memory if possible. A copy of a report made at or about the time of this incident, If such a report exists, would be of considerable value in evaluating the entire question."

"It is apparent from the location and timing, etc. that this incident could be tied in with other possible sightings that might be on the record, but I have not been able to trace any further connections. If a more detailed investigation can be made, I would appreciate being kept informed of any significant developments."

On February 19, 1964
Dayton, Ohio

Dear sir,

I have made out a report concerning a sighting I had of a mysterious object in the sky over Dayton, Ohio.

On the evening of February 15, 1964, at approximately 6:45 p.m. while returning home from work, I observed a very bright, unusual light in the sky. This object seemed to be hovering and stationary. As I watched it, the object suddenly shot off at a tremendous rate of speed towards the northeast, disappearing in just a few seconds. The object did not appear to have any definite shape or form and there was no sound associated with it. Because it was so unusual and unidentified, I felt it should be reported.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
