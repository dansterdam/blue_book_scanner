Time - Approximately 2340 on August 4, 1953 at West Point, Nebraska 

Weather Conditions - Clear sky, Stars bright

Narrative - Had just shut off sprinkler system and was admiring the many stars visible when a moving light moving from north north west to south south east caught my eye. It was slightly brighter than the brightest stars visible. It remained clearly visible at all times until it disappeared from view behind the neighbors house to the south. As it passed to the South and the angle from my point of observation increased, the light decreased in intensity except for about 30 seconds when it was about due south of me when it again grew quite bright. No sound was ever heard. The light was white. It appeared to be at a considerable distance away, thought this is only an opinion as there was nothing to gauge distance by. Any object moving at such a speed through the sky should have given off an identifiable noise if it were close by as the evening was quiet. If it was at quite a distance the speed of the object must have been great.

This objects must have been seen by others who could report its position from other locations. It would seem to me that it should have been picked up on the radar scopes at the Aircraft Warning station In Omaha. If so it may be that identification has been established.
