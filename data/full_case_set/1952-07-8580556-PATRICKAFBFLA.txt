24 July 1952
REPORT ON FLYING OBJECTS AS OBSERVED AT PATRICK AFB, FLORIDA

On 30 July 1952, flying objects were observed over Patrick AFB, Florida. Between the hours of 2100 and 2230, four different objects were observed by several aircraft maintenance personnel. They observed an object approach the base from the South at a very high speed, come to a halt directly over the field, reverse its direction with no apparent turn. At this time an object was seen at high altitudes. This object subsequently one was seen at lower altitudes. This was approximately five seconds later. A fourth object was shortly seen in the West at an angle of approximately 20 degrees from the observers' position, proceeded West, made a wide 180 degree turn over the field and returned to the same original position. Time observed in this observance was ten seconds.

The same type of objects still within a period of five to six minutes. The objects were reported as appearing like a great star of amber color, weather storm balloon with intermittent flashes of light directed on objects but no contacts were made. These two types of objects appear to be related and may have been part of the same tracking.

Five additional personnel reported the same objects and performance which included the airborne officers on duty at the time, control tower operator, aircraft dispatcher and two transient pilots from Wright-Patterson AFB.

Two observations were made on 19 July; however, no report was made.
On 21 July, the undersigned received a call from an airman at 2200 hours reporting a similar object over the field. Two minutes later a call was received from two Colonels on the base, one a former intelligence officer who reported the object had disappeared from the first observer's sight. The undersigned immediately went outdoors to observe the objects which had disappeared by that time. Approximately 3 or 4 minutes later an object was observed by me directly overhead flying on a course of 280 degrees at high altitudes with estimated speed in excess of 700 mph. The object was steady and was flying on an unvarying course with no variation observed. Altitude was estimated to be 20,000 feet. Based on this figure, the speed was approximately 700 mph.

Two observations were made on 19 July; however, no report was made.
On 21 July, the undersigned received a call from an airman at 2200 hours who reported seeing a strange object over the field. Two minutes later a call was received from two colonels on the opposite side of the field. They reported that the object had disappeared from sight. The undersigned immediately went outdoors to observe the objects which had disappeared by that time. Approximately 30 or 40 minutes later an object was observed by me directly overhead flying on a course of 290 degrees at high altitude. It was undoubtedly the same object that had been reported earlier. The object was bright in color. Its speed was steady and was flying on an unerring course with no deviation observed during the entire flight, the object passed out of sight approximately 15 degrees above the horizon in the west. Altitude was estimated 75,000 to 80,000 feet. Based on time, distance and angles observed, its speed was computed to be in excess of 5,000 mph. All reports indicate that the sightings were made and unlimited sky conditions. A check was made with all jet air bases in Florida who reported no operations during the reported hours.

The undersigned is a rated pilot, has been based in the reported area for three years and states that he has never seen such phenomena as this at any time previous.

REPORT ON FLYING OBJECTS AS OBSERVED AT PATRICK AFB, FLORIDA

On 18 July 1952, flying objects were observed over Patrick AFB, Florida, between the hours of 2145 and 2220. The first object was observed to approach the base from the South at a very high speed, coming to a halt directly over the field, reversed its course, and departed to the East, proceeding to the West at high speed. This was followed by a second object on the same course approximately five seconds later. A fourth object was shortly seen in the West at an angle of approximately 20 degrees above the horizon from the observers' position, proceeded West, made a wide 180 degree turn over the field and returned to the same position as the above objects. This observation lasted approximately five to six minutes.

The above four objects all were sighted within a period of five to six minutes. The objects were reported as appearing like a great star of amber color. The objects did not show any means of propulsion, and the tracking of these objects by the type of radars are not considered to be reliable for such tracking.

Five additional personnel reported the same objects and performance which included the airborne officer on duty at the time, control tower operator, aircraft dispatcher and two transient pilots from Wright Patterson AFB.

MEMORANDUM TO LT COL EVANS:

In compliance with your verbal request following is an account of my observation of the incident at Patrick AFB on 20 July 1952:

At approximately 2130, I, together with Mr. and Mr., both employees of Pass Supply, was waiting in a staff car in the parking lot outside the dormitory when the driver first noticed a peculiar light in the sky to the south of the Base. We all then noticed that the light was fluctuating and appeared to move in an erratic manner for a few minutes after which it remained stationary. The light appeared to be unusually bright and at first was thought by all of us to be a star. It was not until we had watched this light and a peculiar maneuver which it made that we concluded that it was not a normal celestial light. The light seemed to flare up and fade alternately. After watching for some time, the light shot off extremely rapidly towards the Southeast and disappeared from sight. It was not noticed again. The light was a reddish-orange or pinkish color. It appeared to be fairly close and definitely not a distant celestial light. It had a somewhat dancing or flickering appearance as it fluctuated in intensity. I am unable to estimate the size or distance but it was quite brilliant and discernable. It happened rather suddenly and left no trail in the sky. We watched this light and a peculiar maneuver which it made that we concluded that it was not a normal celestial light.
