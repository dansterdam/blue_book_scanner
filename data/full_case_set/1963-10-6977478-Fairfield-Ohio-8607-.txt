SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Reported at Fairfield, Ohio
DATE OF SIGHTING: 6 October 1963
LOCATION: Fairfield, Ohio
DATE INVESTIGATED: 6 October 1963
INVESTIGATOR: Lt. G. C. MOORE
REPORT
1. On 6 October 1963 Mr. FRANK J. WINGER, 6118 Furnas Avenue, Fairfield, Ohio, telephone number WO 5-4239, reported that he had sighted an unidentified flying object in the Fairfield area on the evening of 6 October 1963.
2. According to Mr. WINGER, at approximately 10:00 p.m. he was outside his home when he observed a brightly lighted object in the sky. He stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape and was hovering in the sky at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet. Mr. WINGER reported that the object was silent and remained in the same position for several minutes. He further stated that the object then suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from sight.
3. Mr. WINGER reported the incident to the Fairfield Police Department and then contacted this office.
4. An investigation was conducted on 6 October 1963 by Lt. G. C. MOORE of the USAF. However, no physical evidence of the sighting was found, and no other witnesses could be located.
5. Based on the information obtained during the investigation, it is the opinion of this office that the object sighted by Mr. WINGER was probably an aircraft. The rapid acceleration and disappearance of the object is consistent with the characteristics of a jet aircraft. No further action is contemplated.
