REPORT OF FLYING OBJECT

As 2305 hours on 26 November 57 an individual who identified himself as employed as a taxicab driver at Las Vegas, Nevada, made the statement to me that approximately 45 minutes previously, while in the vicinity of State Highway 91, seven miles north of Las Vegas, he observed a strange object in the sky which he describes as follows:
A spherical shaped object approximately 35 feet in diameter, brilliant white in color, and illuminated from within. It was hovering approximately 500 feet above the ground, and he stated that the object was visible for approximately 2-3 minutes, after which it suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and proceeded on a southwesterly direction, being lost from sight in a matter of seconds.

He stated that he informed me that this was reported to the sheriff's department in Clark County, Nevada, and that he had subsequently been in touch with the USAF representative at this base for the purpose of making a personal report.

I asked him to give me all of the particulars on this, falling within the scope of ATIC Order 200-5. This was reported in accordance with instructions.

This was reported as written to the Aerospace Officer immediately after my conversation with this individual. The Air Force was notified, and it was determined that he could not plot the exact area he had seen this object.
