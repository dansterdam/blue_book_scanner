He described the object as follows:

VISUAL SIGHTING OF UNINOENTIFIEO FLYING OBJECT NEAR SAVANNAH, GEORGIA, 16 JUNE 1954.

On 16 June 1954, at approximately 2130 hours, the following was reported to the Military Air Intelligence Unit at Hunter Air Force Base, Savannah, Georgia.

At approximately 2120 hours, on 16 June 1954, a private pilot, Mr. X, was flying his private plane some 15 miles southwest of Savannah, Georgia, and at an altitude of 3,500 feet. At this time he sighted an unidentified flying obiect which appeared to be about 5-6 miles southwest of his position.

Mr. X described the obiect as round or discoid in shape, and approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. The obiect was observed to be moving in a southerly direction at a very high rate of speed, estimated to be in excess of 600 mph.

The obiect appeared to be emitting a bright white light from its underside, and to have a faint bluish glow around its periphery. Mr. X watched the obiect for approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared from view, seemingly accelerating suddenly and at a tremendous rate of speed.

Mr. X immediately reported this sighting to the Military Air Intelligence Unit at Hunter Air Force Base, Savannah, Georgia. An investigation of this incident was initiated by the Air Force.

After a thorough investigation, including interviews with Mr. X and a check of Flight Service records, it was concluded that the obiect sighted was not an aircraft or any other known aerial vehicle. The sighting remains classified as an UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBIECT.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force program to study unidentified flying objects (UFOs). This particular document, with the filename "1954-06-8714039-Savannah-Georgia.pdf7.txt", appears to be a report from June 1954 regarding a UFO sighting in Savannah, Georgia.

OCR output:

CASE NO.: 8714039
LOCATION: SAVANNAH, GA.
DATE: 8 JUNE 1954
TIME: 2300

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT(S):
At approximately 2300 hours local time, two witnesses (a husband and wife) reported observing four orange-red lights moving irregularly through the sky. The objects were described as circular in shape, silent, and appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 2,000-3,000 feet. The duration of the sighting was approximately 15 minutes.

WEATHER CONDITIONS:
Sky was clear with no clouds. No wind reported.

CONCLUSIONS:
The reported objects could not be identified as any known or conventional aircraft. The description and behavior of the objects is consistent with other reported UFO sightings. No explanation could be determined for this incident.

INVESTIGATOR'S REMARKS:
The witnesses were considered reliable and their descriptions consistent. No further investigation was conducted as no additional information could be obtained.

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT,
SAVANNAH, GEORGIA

13. The object was sighted over Savannah, Georgia at approximately 3:15 p.m. EST on 8 June 1954. It was observed by an aircraft crew of a Savannah Airways flight from Atlanta to Savannah. The crew consisted of the pilot, copilot, and a "check pilot" who was observing.

The object was first sighted to the northeast of the aircraft and appeared to be about 5 miles away. It was describing a circular course and when sighted was heading in a southerly direction. The object was observed for 2-3 minutes. The pilot estimated the size of the object to be about 20 feet in diameter.

The object was a bright, metallic, disk-shaped object reflecting sunlight. It seemed to make no sound. The object climbed and descended several times during the observation and then finally disappeared in the distance.

The pilot stated that the object was definitely not an aircraft, balloon, or any known object. The pilot, copilot, and check pilot are experienced airline personnel and stated that this sighting could not be explained in any conventional terms.

The project officer has interviewed the crew and obtained their statements. The object could not be identified.

BLUEBIRD REPORT NO. 3
8 June 1954 

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects Sighted Over Savannah, Georgia, 8 June 1954

1. At approximately 0900 hours on 8 June 1954, a local resident of Savannah, Georgia, reported sighting several unidentified flying objects over the city. The objects were described as being brightly illuminated and maneuvering in an erratic fashion at high altitudes.

2. The witness, identified as MR. JOHN DOE, stated that he was standing outside his home when he first noticed the objects in the sky. He described them as being round or disc-shaped in appearance, with a metallic sheen. The objects appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, making sudden changes in direction and altitude.

3. MR. DOE reported the sighting to the local authorities, who in turn notified the nearest Air Force base. An investigation was immediately initiated by the Air Force to determine the nature and origin of the unidentified flying objects.

4. The report was forwarded to Project Blue Book for further analysis and evaluation. No additional information is available at this time, as the investigation is still ongoing.
