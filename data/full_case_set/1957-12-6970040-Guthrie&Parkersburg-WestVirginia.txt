A round to crescent shaped object. Blue in color, was observed in the sky. Three pelots were of the opinion object was the moon. However, obj supposedly picked up on ground radar.
12. CONCLUSIONS
We believe, probably Balloon, Possibly probably Balloon, probably Aircraft possibly Astronomically,probable, Radar Indication Unidentified, Date univalent ive
11. COMMENTS
This MOON was approaching 1/4 (first quarter) on 14th, sighting on 11th. Direction of obj and moon coincided. No witness indicated seeing obj drop out of moon. There was no meteorological condition, which could have distorted obj. Visual observation would not indicate radar interception of this moon. The radar persistency would be doubtful in direction of this moon. They radar point to prob unlikely visual observation of moon.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
AREA REPORT CONCERNS: PARKERSBURG, OHIO
DATE OF REPORT: 17 DECEMBER 1957

DATE OF INFORMATION: 11 DECEMBER 1957
PREPARING OFFICER: JUANITA MANCHA, 2ND LT, USAF
REFERENCES: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
58TH AD MESSAGE CIT # 038-12
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
SUMMARY: AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WAS SIGHTED ON 12/03/00Z APPROXIMATELY OVER PARKERSBURG, OHIO. AIRBORNE FIGHTING WAS BY AVENGER WHITE FLIGHT. 3 P-61'S INTERCEPTED AT 28,000 FT. ROUND LIGHTING WAS ON SEARCH RADAR. REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE OBJECT WAS ALMOST CIRCULAR AND WAS OF ORANGE COLOR. THE PILOTS REPORT THAT THE OBJECT DID NOT MOVE AND ONLY CHANGE APPEARED TO BE IN RANGE. HOWEVER, THE OBJECT MOVED ERRATICALLY ON THE RADAR SCOPE AND WAS ESTIMATED AT A SPEED OF MUCH 1.5. IT REMAINED IN SIGHT FROM 20 TO 30 MINUTES. THE PILOT'S SIGHTING WAS THAT THE MOON AND THAT RADAR RESULTS WERE NOT THAT THE AIRCRAFT OR RADAR NOISE. CORRELATION BETWEEN RADAR OBSERVED POSITION AND PILOT SIGHTING INDICATE OTHERWISE.

11. Position Title and Comments of the Preparing Officer, including his preliminary analysis of the probable cause of the sightings: Lt Wayne A. Rhodes, Senior Director. Airborne Auxiliary flight, 3 F-86's, USAF, was first observed when 2 white/3 noticed orange glowing object at one o'clock position. He was 20 miles west of Parkersburg, WV, climbing to 25,000 feet. He saw the object had an apparent 3-4 times size of the F-86's and was solid orange colored, stationary, not pulsing. Ground observers at 45,000 feet confirmed sighting. Movement was erratic, sometimes hovering, then resuming speed. An object was crescent shaped, orange-red and glowing. Object on radar appeared to return flight if Parkersburg. Last radar contact was 20 miles north of Parkersburg. Last pilot contact was 30 miles north of Lockbourne. Pilot was heading 350°, Object was following.
