Dear Mrs. _____ 
The Air Force does not disregard any reports officially submitted to them for evaluation. The phenomena which you observed in your letter of Aug 9, 1965 does not come within the limits of the identification classification the Air Force could have made at this late date. It is not feasible to attempt an investigation toward an identification of the object or objects involved.

Regarding the articles from the Philadelphia Inquirer which you mentioned in your letter, a copy of an AF release stating the cause for the stoppage of electromagnetic clocks is attached.

The balloon observed over Portugal and the Azores was probably a weather balloon released by India.

The phenomena observed in the Atlantic was a possible meteor, as described in the article, and the observations in Chile - these observations have not been officially reported to the United States Air Force.

The alleged incident in the article was not reported to the Air Force.

The attached report on Project Blue Book represents the Air Force's position on the UFO program to date.

Sincerely, 

[Signature and stamp]

  Enclosed is the attached letter with enclosings from the Philadelphia Enquirer  relating to unidentified flying objects. The following is submitted for your information:

a. Dear Mr. - - - - - - -

  The Air Force does not disregard any reports officially submitted to this organization. The photographs which you enclosed were analyzed, but no positive identification could be made of the air force as the time an investigation would have been made. There is nothing further that it is possible to attempt an investigation concerning this alleged incident.

Regarding the articles from the Philadelphia Enquirer - 
A review of the data indicates the articles have not changed our position on this subject. The balloons observed over the article described as an "astronomical body". This evaluation was made by HAFB from India. As a result, no special investigation was considered warranted.

The attached brochure represents the Air Force conduct of the UFO program to date.
