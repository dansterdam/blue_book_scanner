Text extracted from the document:

One day I was at home reading my mail about 11:00 A.M. when I looked up and saw this object coming from the east. At first it looked like a normal aircraft but as it came closer I could see that it was not an aircraft but some kind of strange object. It was in a disc or saucer shape and appeared to be made of a brilliant silver metal. It had a dull finish and was completely silent. As it came closer I could see that it was just hovering in the sky. It came to a complete stop and just hovered there for about 10 seconds. Then it started moving again but this time it moved extremely fast and within a few seconds it had disappeared from sight. I am quite certain that this was not an aircraft of any kind that I have ever seen before. I have no idea what it was. I wish I could have gotten a better look at it but it happened so fast. This is the first and only time I have ever seen anything like this.

OCR output:
An Air Force R-47-47, equipped with radar and electronics gear, was flying a routine observation mission over the skies of Kansas, on July 17, 1957. The pilot, Thomas H. Hanley, suddenly observed a strange object moving at high speed across his course.

The object, as observed by the crew, appeared to be approximately 50-75 feet in diameter, round in shape, with a shiny metallic surface, and was moving at an estimated speed of 600-700 miles per hour. The object was observed for a period of about 3 minutes, during which time it performed several maneuvers, such as climbing, diving, and changing directions.

The pilot, Captain Hanley, immediately reported the sighting to his headquarters and requested permission to pursue the object. However, before permission could be granted, the object accelerated to an incredible speed and disappeared from view.

Subsequent investigation and weather analysis confirmed that the sighting could not be attributed to any known aircraft, weather phenomena, or other conventional explanation. The case was thoroughly investigated by the Air Force and was classified as "Unidentified" in the Project Blue Book files.

"Subject: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT

1. On 6 July 1957, at about 2230 hours, the writer and his wife observed an unidentified flying object over Forbes AFB, Kansas. I was outside our quarters when my wife called my attention to a bright light in the northwest sky. At first I thought it might be an aircraft, but as I watched, the light seemed to change in appearance and maneuver in a way that was not characteristic of any aircraft I had ever seen.

2. The object appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length. It was a bright, steady white light which would occasionally blink out and then reappear. At times it seemed to change color slightly, taking on a bluish tint. The object maneuvered in a generally circular pattern, sometimes moving rapidly, then hovering, then darting off in another direction. This maneuvering continued for about 15 minutes.

3. After a few minutes, I became convinced that this was no ordinary aircraft. I hurried into the house and called the control tower at Forbes to report the sighting. By the time I got back outside, the object had moved from the northwest to the west and appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed. It continued this high-speed movement, blinking out and reappearing, until it disappeared from sight to the west.

4. The Air Force radar at Forbes was checked and it was reported that no unidentified targets had been picked up that evening. The weather at the time was clear with unlimited visibility.

5. I am a radar observer by training and have considerable experience in the identification of aircraft. I am convinced that the object I observed was not a conventional aircraft, satellite, or any other known object. It displayed maneuverability and an ability to accelerate to extremely high speeds which are beyond the capabilities of any aircraft I am familiar with.

"The case of the LCVP turning: ECP 53 - 2032 was started on their call, when someone spotted from the ground what appeared to be an LCVP (Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel) turning and maneuvering over Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas, on 18 May 1957. Visual observation and radar tracking indicated that the object was at an altitude of over 20,000 feet and traveling at a speed of over 300 knots. This was an unidentified flying object. It was tracked for some twenty-five minutes before it disappeared from radar.

The major portion of the report deals with observations received from the radar station at Forbes AFB, Kansas. It indicates that the object was sighted visually and tracked on radar for approximately 25 minutes. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of over 20,000 feet and traveling at a speed in excess of 300 knots. The object disappeared from radar when it reached a point approximately 20 miles south of the base.

The radar scope photographs of the object were taken and forwarded to Air Technical Intelligence Center. The report has been reviewed and it is concluded that the object was an unidentified flying object."

With God's attitude of space explorers, the U.S. can do things that neither Russia nor any other nation can do. We have a far better history of the U.S.space program than does Russia. We have had far more successful and ambitious programs. Our communications satellites, weather satellites and scientific satellites have given the U.S. a great technological lead which is continuing to increase. We must be patient and allow time for the former president to complete his plans which will be for the good of the country.

Recently you published a letter from L. E. (Bud) Sackett, Dr. Secretary Voice, I do not intend to do any more of that type of thing. I am absolutely against the plan which your program has come up with. I am sure those who did not expect a good reception in the plan for California are right. Another from the State of California summer so-called plan is not wise choice for California, it would be wrong for California.

SCIENTISTS SAY NEAR COLLISIONS
MAY INVOLVE SPACESHIP
Congressmen Investigate Cases

The possibility that spaceships may be involved in some near collisions is always being considered by the CAA (Civil Aeronautics Administration), the Air Force, and the Congress.  

The two scientists made this suggestion after seeing reports on recent near collisions involving airliners.  The near collisions were thought by some to have been caused by "unknown objects" in the sky.

The investigation conducted by American Airlines showed that in the case of a TWA (Trans World Airlines) Constellation airliner near Houston recently, the airliner definitely collided with a "mysterious unidentified" object in the early morning darkness.  

In the second incident, several of the 34 passengers aboard a TWA Constellation airliner from Los Angeles to Kansas City reported seeing "mysterious lights" around their plane.  Captain Robert Adickes, who was the pilot, said he had no idea what the objects were.

The suggestion made by the two unnamed officials was that the objects involved in these near collisions might be "unknown natural satellites".  However, the CAA (Civil Aeronautics Administration) stated that the same objects could quite conceivably be "spaceships".

Dr. Hynek, a noted astronomer, stated the same opinion.  He said, "that the phenomena are not known natural satellites, as some think, but are 'spaceships' under intelligent control."

The CAA Aeronautics Board informed the public that the Board was giving "serious consideration" to the possibility that unidentified flying objects were responsible for the near collisions. This fact was later denied by the CAA, which indicated that the Board had not actually reached such a conclusion.

According to the CAA report, eight passengers were injured when a TWA Constellation airliner collided with an unidentified object near Kansas City. The collision, resulting in dead-end-injuries, occurred from 14,000-foot altitude when the crew saw a bright light approach their plane. 

Neither Captain Scemes nor his co-pilot could identify the unidentified light. The CAA communications station showed that the TWA (Trans World Airlines) craft had reported it was being followed by an unidentified light.

In the AA (American Airlines) case, the CAA (Civil Aeronautics Board) investigated and questioned the crew. They stated that they had seen four-winging objects, which disappeared at high speed.

THE RB-47 UFO CASE -- A NEW EXPLANATION
By Philip J. Klass

This is an analysis of one of the most curious UFO cases on record. It illustrates that a UFO report which may at first seem to be inexplicable only in terms of an extra-terrestrial phenomenon can often be explained by more plausible, if less sensational, factors.

The case involves an Air Force RB-47 on a flight over four southern states (Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas) during the pre-dawn hours of July 17, 1957. An account of the incident was published in the July 1, 1957, issue of the AAJA Magazine (Astronautics), by Lt. Col. William J. Weiman. It was claimed that the crew witnessed an unidentified object that paced their aircraft for almost an hour and a half, and later that night, ships from other worlds.

The crew's original report indicates that the RB-47, flying at high-altitude and high-speed, suddenly encountered an intensely brilliant light which paralleled the aircraft's course for approximately an hour and a quarter, sometimes pacing the aircraft, sometimes pulling ahead. The crew also reported that the light was able to fly at supersonic speed and to hover, had "played cat and mouse" with the RB-47 for a considerable period, and had been detected by electronic intelligence (ELINT) equipment aboard the RB-47, and by an Air Defense Command ground radar station.

In another published paper on the RB-47 incident, McDonald called it "a classic case in the natural history of UFO phenomena" (UFO symposium sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, June 1966).

My own investigation prompts quite a different conclusion. After a careful study of the electronic data, I believe the mysterious light was a series of reflections from the planet Jupiter, whose position in the sky at the time was just about where the crew reported seeing the UFO.

An inherent difficulty in investigating any old UFO case, such as this one which occurred more than 13 years ago, is the principle which have difficulty in accurately recalling some details. A more serious problem is possible embellishment, due to the passage of time, added details intended to make the data more sensational.

When an investigator must choose between conflicting accounts given by the same individual, he is sometimes forced to reject parts of the story as being probably inaccurate. Where there is physical evidence to support the later, he must decide on the "consistency" version. (In the AAJA article, the early account indicated the crew had seen "ships from other worlds.")

However, there may be an obvious error in the contemporary report. For instance, the Air Force's own investigative report (contained in the Blue Book file) gives a time of the initial sighting 10 minutes earlier than the time given in the Astronautics article. This report shows the RB-47 to be at two widely separated locations at the claimed times, which seems certain to be incorrect.

Where there is a discrepancy between early accounts of two crew members, the report by the individual more directly involved in the event seems more likely to be correct. For example, in Chase's original report, the pilot said that the UFO did not show up on the aircraft's radar - but in a later account, he said it did.

- page 14 -

This page from the Project Blue Book report does not contain any photographs. 

The text in the document is as follows:

"The RB-47's navigation radar (AN/APS-23). This was confirmed by the navigator himself. McDanald reported. However, BCM (Capt) McClure of the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing told me that he, Frank R. McClure, was told by the crew that no radar was used for this purpose on this mission. In this case, it seems appropriate to accept the recollection of the pilot and navigator as the more definitive. 

Another example: McClure is positive that the mission on July 17, 1957, was intended for the RB-47's being sent overseas and that it was not a regular training mission. Rh-47 Pilot Chase disagrees. In this particular case, the crew members expressed difficulty in recalling details of the mission's purpose and the time it was taken. If such a log were available, it would have been turned over to the Flying Inspections Division of the Air Force. However, Strategic Air Command Headquarters contains only a spotty data. Further, McClure states that the flight had certain radio contact points, but no such log or evidence was found to check the UFO details.

None of the discrepancies between the crew members' original and recent accounts appears sufficient to establish any significant doubt as to the essential facts. Rather, they are believed to be the result of honest differences in recollection after the passage of a considerable time interval. There was an initial effort to investigate the incident, but this was not pressed after it was determined that no photographic or other tangible evidence was available."

OCR text output:

West-bound leg: The three ENM operators would check their equipment against the spurious ground radars and military communications found in this region.

THE FIRST INCIDENT:
This incident involved only some unusual behavior of the AN/ALA-6 Flint equipment operated by ECM Monitor #2, Frank B. McClure. There are no reports of any visual UFO sightings.

McClure's current recollection is that the incident occurred as the RB-47 was approaching the Brookley Air Force Base Station in Alabama. Although radar tracking apparently confirmed the presence of the unidentified aircraft, McClure did not discuss this with other crew members of the anomalous behavior of his equipment at the time; it is not possible to determine other crew members' reactions for this incident. in the event the incident occurred near Biloxi.

As the ALA-6 indicated the contact, McClure decided to check the operation of the equipment, knowing that the aircraft was approaching air defense ground radars against which the ALA-6 was designed to function. The system involved the acquisition by the ALA-6 of an associated AN/APR-9 pulse analyzer.

The signals characteristics, among taking several bearings to the source of the signal at the pulse analyzer, indicated the position of ground radar and to measure the characteristics. The ALA-6 can be fitted with several different types of antennas, depending on the frequency of the ground radars involved. (See ALA-6 Handbook of Operating Instructions covering this installment). The ALA-6 contains a test transmitter operating at 1,000 mc. (c-band), and a receiver. It consists of two nearly identical parabolic antenna dishes which move automatically at 130 rpm or 200 rpm, scanning the area of interest.

To illustrate how the ALA-6 functions to measure bearing to a ground radar, which is important to understanding the 060 case, when the Flint aircraft is within receiving range of a ground radar and the radar and airplane antennas come into alignment, the ALA-6 is assured of receiving ground radar.

The signals received are fed to the APR-9 Flint receiver for detection/amplification for the Flint operators. The frequency selector switch allows the Flint operators to select the signal of interest at specific tunable 10 mc. filter steps. "Off-axis", the antenna assembly contains a servo-mechanism whose rotor is geared to the parabolic dishes and rotates the whole in the same direction as the dishes. This servo-mechanism then determines the azimuth bearing and feeds the information to the deflection amplifiers and then to the vertical/horizontal deflection plates of the ALA-6 CRT display.

At such times as the airplane is illuminated by a radar, the ALA-6 will display the situation somehow as shown in Fig. 3. (See next page.) The photo shown is an idealized version copied from the ALA-6 operator's manual.

- page 16 -

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a report document, possibly related to Project Blue Book, discussing radar observations and the behavior of an object detected by radar.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

Because the PPI of the ALA-6 display corresponds to a bearing of 175° of the aircraft indicator, this indícates the azimuth of the aircraft was 175°. If the radar was dead-ahead of the aircraft, then the radar would be astern of the airplane, on its right-hand side.

As the aircraft files along, unless the radar is dead-ahead or astern, the radar set scanning cone is moving in a circle around the aircraft. If the airplane is turning toward the radar, then the bearing will move.

As the RB-47 approached the coast in the predawn hours of July 17, 1957, the scope pictures decided to change out his equipment. Beginning at the high end of the APR-9 frequency range (5,000 me), he found an alarming signal on the radar, one of several models then in use. (A slightly later version of the RB-47 aircraft was the ANF/PS-10, with identical signal characteristics.)

It is important to note that McClure did not write down the precise frequency of the S-band signal so we are not certain of the precise frequency of the S-band signal line incident.

The S-band signal even showed that the source was a scanning C-band radar. This is manifested by the brief appearance, then disappearance, of the signal bearing display on the airplane's B-scan indicator. As the antenna rotates to where it no longer illuminates the airplane, the signal disappears.

McClure was not surprised to see a signal with the characteristics described to me, for such a radar was installed near Mirlox, near the RB-47 position. Signals from this radar were also monitored with an APN force in the vicinity.

The signal was "mighty strong," according to McClure, as would be expected if it came from the 630-68 radar. However, the ALA-6 showed the radar to be on the RIGHT-HAND SIDE of the RB-47, not roughly the FRONT as would be expected from the Mirlox radar. McClure knew there were no such shipboard radars.

As the RB-47 continued toward Victorville, McClure noted another anomalous characteristic. Instead of the displayed bearing moving down-scope, it moved up-scope. McClure knew that such behavior could occur if the airplane were in a climbing maneuver. (This would confirm the fact that the incident happened near the coast rather than at Healdton.)

- page 17 -

The image contains an electrical schematic diagram with various components labeled, including an ALA-6 detection finder, an ASA-656 antenna assembly, and other related parts and connections. There is no photograph present in this image.

McClure decided that there must be a malfunction in his ALA-6, but he did not report it to the aircraft commander at the time. (It was not until later, following the installation of the electronic counter-measure devices on the RB-47 at greater than the RB-47's 500 mph speed.)

Analysis of circuite diagram from the ALA-6 instruction books suggests several possible malfunctions that could cause an anomalous up-down movement, one of which is considered more probable, i.e. the ALA-6 antenna is moved from the optimum signal when the signal is horizontally polarized, while the other is used when the signal is vertically polarized.

The ALA-6 operator selects the proper antenna dish by means of a toggle switch on the ALA-6 control panel. If the incorrect one is selected, the signals received will not be properly processed and the optimum signal may not be obtained.

When selecting the appropriate antenna dish, care must be exercised to insure that the relay KPOL will be operated to obtain correct polarization to the APR-9 receiver. The spring-loaded relay then connects the horizontally polarized dish to the APR-9.

The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a scanned page from a document with text and technical diagrams. 

Transcription of the text in the document:

So that the bearing displayed on the ALA-6 will correspond to the antenna dish in use.

The same toggle switch that applies, or removes, the +28 volts from relay K-701 to the synchronous motor in the receiver, to give SYNCHRONOUS TORQUE, SHOULD FAIL TO ACTUATE WHEN THE BEARING-TO-THE-RADAR-PASSES-THE RADAR, THE INDICATED HEARING THEN WILL MOVE UP-SCOPE INSTEAD OF DOWN-SCOPE.

The switch toggle is not only the means of connecting or disconnecting the CPS-6B radar at BORESIGT, but also determines the direction in which the bearing displayed on the ALA-6 will move.

According to McClure's recent recollection, the displayed bearing movement did coincide with the ALA-6 antenna dish movement. This would be the angular movement expected if the RR-47 was within approximately 20 miles of the sited radar.

In the mid-1950s, at the time the ALA-6 was built, the two primary components comprising the unit were the basic ALA-6 system and the CPS-6B radar. The unit's purpose was for a missile tracking mission, to be discussed shortly, suggests that the malfunction of K-301 intermixed the temporary one and that it later caused the anomalous bearing.

This could have resulted from an imperfect, cold-solder connection, to explain a +300 termination, or within the solenoidal call -- another possibility is that moisture accumulated in the K-301 relay, causing a humidity-related malfunction.

The same sort of 180° ambiguity could also result if relay K-301 functioned properly, but the antenna dish of the opposite rotation had been connected. This condition, it would be operating from an antenna dish of the opposite rotation as designated by the incidence, should be readily observable. However, because the RR-47 was so close to the powerful CPS-6B at Bison1, the distortion in the ALA-6 strength might be detectable.

Beyond the possibility of an 180° ambiguity caused by a malfunction of relay K-701, there are other sources, such as an intermittent malfunction in the synchronization. McClure says that he abandoned the anomalous bearing signal after about 5 minutes, without noticing the aircraft commander or the other two-limit (IGO) operators. Some remained unaccounted for.

OCR output:

Time later, McClure recalls that he decided to check the ALA-6 against other air defense radars. These reports indicate that the defense command in the Topeka, Kansas, area was informed of the sighting of these L-band radars. (This detail is not included in the original AFSC report.) It would appear from the information available that this checking of the ALA-6 against L-band radars is correct. It would seem that the transient targets checked the ALA-6 against L-band radars is correct.

THE SECOND INCIDENT:
The pilot turned west near Meridian and took up a true heading of 265° on a path toward Waco, during which time the three fighter operators were to check out their equipment, including the ALA-6 gear. At 10:02 the pilot switched to the "air-to-air" ("yellow") frequency for communications in the region. At 10:05, he reported "No contacts," indicating that the ALA-6 gear was working properly and that no unidentified flying objects were detected in front of the aircraft. Suddenly, a white light with light blue tint appeared coming toward the aircraft from the 1 o'clock position. As the pilot and copilot watched, this light seemed to disappear just in front of the aircraft, the airplane disappearing at roughly a 2:30 o'clock position.

The incident is interesting. The luminous object seemed to remain stationary, "hovering," and was first observed to be in the right front quarter of the airplane. This luminous object seemed to remain motionless or practically so. It disappeared and conceivably could have been the "Civil Aeronautic Administration" traffic controllers or from any of the ground control intercept units which were in operation at that time.

Large meteors, or "fireballs," on a near-horizontal trajectory often produce UFO reports, even from experienced pilots. For example, on Dec. 5, 1965, a former Royal Canadian Air Force pilot observed a "large, bright, round object" flying near Pittsburgh, Pa., at 4:15 p.m. (daylight) on Air Canada flight #781. Quoting from his letter: "I was looking out the window toward the west when I saw it. It was a soft pencil-shaped object, flying horizontal at about 70 degrees into the horizon. It traveled at an extremely high speed and seemed to produce no noise whatsoever. I am a former Royal Canadian Air Force pilot from the last war, and I had never seen anything like it before. I reported this incident to the RCAF and forwarded changes in direction and speed."

If this incident had occurred very late at night and/or over a thinly populated area, this particular high-speed object still be unexplainable. However, because she same object reported by this RCAF pilot was also seen and reported by hundreds of people, this UFO is identifiable as a bright meteor. It seems that a number of USAF pilots and other flight personnel have also been witnesses to bright meteor sightings and which was photographed by a man in Michigan who obtained four good pictures.

The RB-47 incident occurred at 5:10 a.m. Central Daylight Saving time. When there would be very ground observers, if any, in the summer of 1957, it was not a surprising circumstance, considering the publicity that the object they had seen might be a UFO, for the commanding officer of the RB-47 would be more UFO reports filed with the USAF in 1957 than in any previous year except 1952.

THE THIRD INCIDENT:
When McClure noticed ECM Monitor #3, Walter A. Tuchscherex, laughing and asked the reason, Tuchscherex (who had been listening on the R-47 intercept) replied: "They're getting ECCM pretty well." According to Tuchscherex, the signal that McClure had detected earlier was an electronic countermeasures (ECM) signal, and the operators were having success in countering it.

The report goes on to provide details about the technical characteristics of the detected radar signal, including its pulse repetition frequency, pulse length, and scan rate. It also mentions that the CPS-6B radar system detected six separate beams from three different antenna dishes, each operating in a different part of the S-band.

The text indicates that an expert on the APR-9 blind receiver stated that the small incident could easily cause an operator to re-tune from the signal, as it would not take more than 10-15 seconds for him to re-tune from it.

OCR Text:

However, if the signal was coming from the Duncanville radar the displayed bearing would have been approximately 330 degrees in relation to the airplane course axis so that if the RB-47 were maneuvering at the time, this signal could not be useful to examine subsequent ALA-6 bearing measurements and compare them with the expected values of the Duncanville radar. All times/events are based on the pilot's report, unless otherwise noted.

At 10:352, McClure reported the S-band signal to be at a relative bearing of 65 degrees. From my calculations the B-47 flight path was passing in level flight through the bearing of 65 degrees.

At 10:382, the S-band signal bearing was approximately 40 degrees. The bearing to the Duncanville radar was previously reported as approximately 330 degrees.

At 10:392, the aircraft commander "sighted a huge light which he estimated to be 500,000 to 600,000 feet, weather permittly clear." Although the aircraft commander could not determine the exact size of object, it appeared much larger than a normal aircraft at 44,500 feet. (NOTE: This was the first visual sighting since 10:102, and did not occur until nine minutes after the last signal was recorded.)

At 10:402, McClure reported he then had two signals at relative bearings of approximately 70 to 75 degrees. These signals were changing in intensity and apparent bearing to the Duncanville radar. However, these two objects appeared at the same time with some red-color. (This does not seem consistent with a visual sighting of a single light.)

If the S-band signal was coming from a UFO, then the characteristics described in this report indicate two signals at two different bearing angles (from a single signal source), which would be consistent with the illustration of two signals at two different bearing angles, as shown in Fig. 5 of the ALA-6 Handbook of Operating Instructions. The handbook says "this indicates the received signal consists of two signals at two different bearing angles (from a single signal source)."

Shortly after 10:402, the RB-47 commander obtained permission from administration to deviate from the assigned training flight mission in order to close on the S-band signal to the heading of 320 degrees, putting it on a patch that would take the RB-47 closer to the Duncanville radar station (code name "Ranger"), requesting all assistance possible, in its UFO chase. At 10:412, only a single S-band signal was noted by McClure, having a bearing also from the RB-47 calculated flight path, indicating a return to the Duncanville radar.

OUTPUT TEXT:
could be approximately 20°.  Chase accelerated the RB-47 as the "object pulled ahead" [Pilots account] in an effort to close on it. [Chase's original Airborne Observer's account] The ALA-6 was a G.C.A. interrogator-radar set operated under Ground Control Approach which was more recent installation is located as a supplementary system to the ALA-6 for such purposes.

At 10:42:52, the ALA-6 once again showed TWO 5-band signals, with bearings of 320°. This the B-47 had now completely lost turn onto the new 320° bearing, the bearing to Duncanville would have been roughly 310° but the bearing could not be held with the rudder and throttle. Fifty seconds later at 10:43:02, the ALA-6 once again showed only a single 5-band signal, with a bearing that should have been roughly 10°. [The estimated bearing to Duncanville was actually 10°.]

At 10:44:02, the Duncanville radar station asked the RB-47 to turn on its radar transponder "III" for positive identification, then requested (crew to advise) position of object. [This seems to indicate the defense radar personnel should have been able to determine the aircraft's position, but they were not able to identify the object on their scopes.] The radar station was typically light traffic, considering the typically light traffic in the pre-dawn hours. The radar to identify the RB-47 from the pilot's estimated position and reported altitude.]

When the RB-47 commander reported he had observed no apparent visual contact of object as indicated by the radar station, he was immediately informed there was positive visual contact but no contact on the radar scope. Again, it almost suggests an inexperienced or inaccurate radar station crew.]

At approximately 10:50:02 pilots observed (to flight crew) a stop and make a turn. "Utah (radar)" reported they lost object from scope at this time, and felt they radar had lost target. If this confirmed RB-47 was no longer the illuminated by the vertical-scope, it is possible the ALA-6 was showing a new target. A crew lost its visual target will be discussed shortly.

The RB-47 commander, thinking he had overflown the UFO, began a turn to the left "shortly after passing between Dallas and Ft. Worth." This is probably the same time which the object disappeared from the Duncanville radar. The radar at Duncanville said it would again be illuminated by the vertical-center beam. [For coverage of the Duncanville radar so that it would again be illuminated by the vertical-center beam.]  

At the same time, "Utah (radar)" regained scope contact. This is believed to be an error in the Pilot's account according to extended correspondence with Pilot Chase, who is certain that the new visual contact was not confirmed by the radar.BECAUSE THE FLIGHT CREW COULD NOT LOOK IN THIS DIRECTION WITHOUT BEING DETECTED BY THEIR RADAR OPERATIONS ADVISED OF THEIR NEW UNIDENTIFIED RADAR TARGET, this is not indicated in the Pilot's account.

+on finder) scope," according to the Pivett account. For the calculated RB-47 posi-
tion and speed "the bearing indication should have been moving up southwardly,"
as became apparent from the second plot. This was because of the direction of the ground
speed and the fact, bearing indication should have been "moving up southwardly."

At 10:52z, the Pivett account says that the RB-47 crew notified Duncanville that
the aircraft was "running low on fuel and would have to head back to its Topeka
base." [Chase now believes that this was done several minutes later than 10:52z, but
the discrepancy is not of consequence.]

At 10:57z, the ALA-6 showed a signal with a bearing of 300*̂ based on the RB-47
position, the bearing to this point of light would produce an indication on the bearing
meter that would be 270 .̂ This would make it possible for McClure to obtain a very
accurate measurement.

Also at 10:57z, the Pivett account says that the Duncanville radar "had no scope
contact" with the unidentified target. There is no further mention of ground radar
contacts for 10:57z. The RB-47 report indicates"RADAR CONTACT MADE BY DUNCANVILLE 
RADAR WAS LOST AT THIS TIME BETWEEN 10:44Z AND 10:50Z, AND AGAIN BETWEEN 10:54Z AND 
10:57Z" FOR NO MORE THAN SEVEN MINUTES -- between 10:44Z and 10:50Z, and again
between 10:54Z and 10:57Z.

At 10:58z, according to the Pivett account, the aircraft commander "regained
visual contact" of the light approximately 3 minutes earlier than the crew had
lost ground radar contact. The crew continues with a variety of verbal and visual
attempts to close with the object, but they are unsuccessful. Captain McClure, using
"strange and ambiguous language," explaining that it was the RB-47 that was "northwest of Ft. worth
land sight" and had made the visual contact, although no such sighting was reported with
Radar assistance. Actually Places the RB-47 west of Ft. worth, not northwest.]

At 11:00z, according to the RB-47 pilot, Chase recalls that he obtained permission to dive toward 
the visual object, and that the aircraft maneuvered to within 20,000 ft. of the
object. However, almost continuously during this maneuver the crew would lose
sight of the object. Apparently, this was probably due to the object's irregular
movement, and just after this maneuver, the aircraft gave up its chase and headed north toward Topeka.

At 11:15z, according to the Pivett account, the aircraft commander reports the flight to the Duncanville/Ft. Worth Area. Accordingly the World Almanac, official sunrise at Dallas on July 17, 1957 was 11:16. This suggests that the sky was bright enough that the crew should not find any unusual craft or object when they reached the area where the visual contact was sighted. [Duncanville] was unable to regain contact although they thought it could have landed or was maneuvering at a nearby Air Force base.

According to the Pivett account, the RB-47 finally took up a heading for home at 
11:21, and by 11:40z, the aircraft was "roughly 60 miles west of Oklahoma City."  The 11:32z
time indicates the time to cover the 60 miles, indicating an average speed of approximately
520 mph which was characteristic of the RB-47.  The aircraft's position at 10:50z when it is known
to have been near Dallas/Ft. Worth.

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

from 11:202 (or 11:022) until 11:402, the ALA-6 was again showing an S-band sig-nal, which would indicate the continuation or recurrence of the previous signal. Further, the signal pixetz according to the visual observers, "moved in a strange and erratic manner."

This is precisely what would be expected if the S-band signal were coming from the aircraft-signal detector radar which would be at a distance of roughly 180° as the BB-47 headed north. (See Fig. 6.) Furthermore, the signal should persist with little variation in strength, and show little or no relative motion, if it was coming from a ground source within the normal limit of cover-age.

On Sept. 5, 1951, I first wrote to ALA-6 operator McClure, seeking clarification
of some aspects of this case. In his reply, dated Sept. 10, McClure volunteered the following view:

"I personally think that there was no airborne signal of this nature, so I can only assume that it was ground based generated signal must have been observed."

In a subsequent telephone conversation and later correspondence, McClure re-stated his opinion even more emphatically.

"If the CPS-6 type signal had indeed come from an airborne vehicle, the signal
would have been within receiving range of the air defense radars at Houston, Dallas
and Oklahoma City. There it would have been detected. As there were no detections
or any CIRVIS reports from these radars, I am forced to conclude the signal must have been. come from an airborne source within receiving range. YET THERE WAS NO REPORT
OF ANY VISUAL OBSERVATION SO FAR AS I KNOW."

Furthermore, if there had been an unknown craft flying in the vicinity of the BB-47, it would have been detected by many air defense radar stations in Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas or Oklahoma. But no CIRVIS report for this area, and no such visual observation.

Curiously, the formal teletype report filed by the Duncanville radar station commander, within four hours of the incident (14:432), said the report was "No significant detection -- no further information." The report said nothing substantial about "any airborne target of the magnitude of a BB-47 according to instructions."

This seems to contradict statements by the BB-47 crew members, yet there is no reason to doubt the veracity of their account. The only logical explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that between the time of the incident (roughly 10:53) and the Duncanville radar station's report, the airborne object or signal had either gone out of their reception range or had simply disappeared.

If this were the case, the Duncanville station commander might well have been tempted to submit a "no significant detection" report, and would logically try to minimize the whole incident with the cryptic phrase, "No further information." NEGATIVE CONTACT WITH SUBJECT -- by the time the unknown was identified, it may have been well beyond direct radio communications range of Duncanville.

Text from the document:

There is reason to believe that the "unidentified" target that appeared on the scopes of the Duncanville, Texas, radar on July 17, 1956. This flight from Los Angeles, California, could have been scheduled for that day. If the flight was on time on July 17, the aircraft would have been making its approach over the Dallas-Fort Worth area at the time the radar contact was reported by Duncanville. Radar coverage of this area at that time would have identified such a flight.

The RB-47 flight crew reported that the visual object (light) was located northwest of Duncanville. This light was confirmed by air visual contact and jet interceptors as "unidentified".

The original Airborne Observer's Report has a question which asks whether the RB-47 flight crew saw any other traffic and he recently reconfirmed this in response to my query. Yet if Fit. #956 was definitely en route, then this particular RB-47 crew could not have been the "visible UFO" seen by Dallas/Ft. Worth.

If the unidentified radar target noted by the Duncanville radar was indeed Fit. #956, its reappearance on the scope at 10:30Z, and subsequent re-appearance is understandable by examination of the coverage patterns of the Duncanville radar. (See appendix 2). Such size and type of vehicle (aircraft) would fit into the pattern of the radar coverage.

If the Duncanville lights were the RB-47 which the RB-47 flight crew identified as "unidentified UFO", which the RB-47 aircraft could not have seen because Fit. #956 was en route at that time, then it is certain that this particular RB-47 could not have been the "visible UFO" seen by Dallas/Ft. Worth.

Any attempt to identify the source of this light 14 years after the incident is a hopeless task, especially for an investigator who is not familiar with possible ground-based light sources in that region, such as industrial facilities, oil refineries, etc.

In summary:
The real crux of this UFO case is whether the source of the 5-band signal, which had all the characteristics of an airborne craft, was in fact some other scheduled aircraft. If this signal was being radiated by an airborne object/craft, there are only three possibilities: 
1) U.S. aircraft 
2) U.S. air force aircraft, which makes no sense for the U.S. to go to the expense and trouble of building a CPS-6B like radar and mounting it on an aircraft. 
3) foreign aircraft, which is highly unlikely.

Text from the document:

prompted by the RB-47 incident. The letter, originally classified, says: "This office
knows of no similar incident having this characteristics disclosed."

1. I have personally questioned several long-time Blint specialists, including a former
chief, and they unanimously stated that such equipment has been designed and built invisible for having developed the airborne CPS-6B radar mimic. It is nearly 20 years ago
that development of it was estimated, and it is constantly being researched, yet none of the blint specialists have ever heard of such equipment.

2. A foreign aircraft -- one more modern and jet aircraft controlled -- had jet aircraft
that of an RB-47. If either country had such equipment, it could hardly conceal the
equipment against U.S. air defense, such as in Laos, Mexico, or the international waters
of U.S. air space, without risking a grave international incident by penetration.

3. If either country had built the equipment for the purpose of spoofing, or "playing games," the fact that it is suitable for being carried aboard aircraft would have been
admitted in some quarters long ago. But no one in any quarters has ever admitted it.

An extra-terrestrial (E-T) spacecraft: Inasmuch as the signal had all of the
characteristics of a CPS-6B/FPS-10 I.F.F. radar, it seems certain that the equipment was spesignal having gone to so much trouble, as it would seem logical for the E-T's to
utilize existing electronic equipment rather than to construct a new radar mimic. The latter
shows.

If the E-T went to the trouble of building a CPS-6B type radar and transporting
it all the way to Earth for the capricious purpose of playing games with the crew
of an airliner, then clearly, the mission was one of a deception character -- a distracting
performance, if you will, to divert attention from the true purpose. Then the appearance
of the RB-47 -- among all of those aloft around the Earth on July 17, 1957, as an unidentified aircraft --

CONCLUSIONS:
The analyst believes that the B-hand signal with all of the characteristics of
a CPS-6B/FPS-10 radar actually came from radars of this type as used and Duncan-ville.
The signal bearings reported by pilots, based on figures furnished, located down by
an identifiable ground station.

Text from the document:

FAILURE:

When plotted against the RB-47 flight path, generally coincide with the detector indications contained in the RADAR equipment. The match is too perfect to be a coincidence.

if the s-hand signals displayed on the ALA-6 came from ground radars, and if the indicated target flight paths displayed on the Indicator corresponded to the aircraft's flight. An analysis of the data would indicate that the object that flashed by the RB-47 at 10,102, which had all the earmarks of a bright object and the implied telemetry collected by the GENERAL ELECTRIC ballistics/Telemetering station at FORBES AFB, Kansas.

IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE SERIES OF UNUSUAL INCIDENTS PROMPTED THE RB-47 CREW TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAD AN ENCOUNTER WITH AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. SINCE THEIR INTEREST WAS NEARLY AN ALL-TIME HIGH, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISING IF THE RB-47 CREW HAD NOT REACHED SUCH A CONCLUSION.

CREW COMMENTS:

A draft of this analysis-report was submitted to the two principal RB-47 crew members involved in this incident for their reactions, which follow:

Lewis D. Chase, RB-47 aircraft commander/pilot:
"I think this study is an excellent work. I apologize for leaving you would notice to request an analysis - and my thanks for your excellent work. As you can see, I am pleased with the content and the care with which it has been prepared."

Frank B. McClure, ECM Monitor #2:
"I am certain that for some reason we had intercepted ground signal that moved an object: I know that once we were near an airfield and (flying) north toward Forbes (AFB), the signals were undoubtedly CPS-6B/FPS-10 air defense radars. I do believe an UFO was emitting these signals."

IMPLICATIONS:
1. If it were not for the belated discovery of the original ("contemporary") records, manager as they are, this case would be inexplicable simply because of the discontinuity between the discrepancy in the current records and those original documents. But since the UFO cases lack such original documentation, they must remain unexplained. But this discontinuity-exploitation should not simply that they involve extraterrestrial vehicles.

2. Even when original data are available, if an investigator approaches his task with a conscious or unconscious bias to find no conventional explanation, then the investigator will end up with extraterrestrial "spaceships" as the only possible alternative, then the investigator will find no plausible conventional explanation.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: The observer, an Air Force officer, first observed the object at 0645 on 8 July 1957 in a south westerly direction from Forbes AFB, Kansas. The object appeared stationary at first but then began maneuvering at a high rate of speed. As other observers arrived the object suddenly disappeared.
INVESTIGATORS CONCLUSIONS: The investigators were unable to determine the nature of the object. They did not consider it to be a conventional aircraft, meteor, or satellite. They felt that the object could not be satisfactorily explained in conventional terms.
RECOMMENDATIONS: None.

SUBJECT: Request for Analysis of Electronic UFO Report  
TO: AFOTN-HA ATTACH: Capt. G. T. Gregory FROM: AFOTN-HA1
DATE: 30 Oct 57 COMMENT: MR 2 SITE: Forbes AFB, Kansas REPORT NO: 5263-63/57

1. This report is difficult to evaluate because there is a much as a case of evidence which is all the side evidence to substantiate the presence of a physical object or UFO. With the exception of radar-abrupt disappearance of returns on the electronic type, radar indications, and similar indications. The unusual type beam speeds, abrupt changes of course, etc. These abnormal indications are usually characteristic of UFO phenomena. Considered and evaluated, the findings indicate an unidentified aerial vehicle.

2. The electronic data is unusual in this report in that radar signals (presumably returns from the object) possess all the characteristics of ground radar equipment, and in fact are similar to GPA-1A. This raises the question of as to whether the equipment reporting is actually ground equipment and not airborne.

3. Since the type equipment on the ground (at "Usual") is not known, and since there is no correlation between the ground interpret and the airborne equipment, it is difficult to conclude that nothing was present, in the face of the visual and other data presented.

It appears to be a typed letter from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Civil Aeronautics Administration, regarding two UFO incidents that occurred in July 1957 near Amarillo, Texas and El Paso, Texas. The letter describes the details of the reported sightings and indicates that the administration is establishing a procedure to investigate the results of all civil aeronautics administration investigations involving civilian aircraft and the sighting of unidentified flying objects.

U. S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
CIVIL AERONAUTICS ADMINISTRATION
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

NOV 8 1957

Dear General Watson:

This will acknowledge receipt of your letter, reference number AFOTN-W1, dated October 7, 1957, in which copies of the Civil Aeronautics Administration final report of investigation of two incidents involving unidentified flying objects are requested.

The first incident mentioned occurred on July 22, 1957, near Amarillo, Texas, and involved a flight by a Southwest Airlines flight No. 517. Investigation proved that the unidentified object was another aircraft, which was identified as a U. S. Air Force KC-97 aircraft which was known to be operating in the area at that time.

The second incident mentioned occurred on July 17, 1957, near El Paso, Texas, and involved American Airlines flight No. 654. Investigation of this incident proved that the unidentified object was American Airlines' flight No. 666, which had previously departed from El Paso, en route to Dallas.

Since both incidents, referred to above, have been determined to involve other aircraft, it is assumed that the above information will suffice for your records.

In accordance with your request, we are establishing a procedure whereby authentication will be made of the results of all Civil Aeronautics Administration investigations involving civilian aircraft and the sighting of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely yours,

(signed)
Roy Keeley, Office of Flight Operations and Airworthiness
