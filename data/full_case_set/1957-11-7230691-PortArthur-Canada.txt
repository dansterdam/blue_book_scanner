The image contains a photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The document appears to be an old Project Blue Book report, and the photograph shows an object that appears to be a glowing light or flare. The text accompanying the image provides some details about the sighting, including the estimated speed and altitude of the object.

As for the text in the document, it reads:

VISUAL APPEARANCE WOULD BE BALLOON WITH FLARE, HOWEVER SHAPE UP TO 7 OR 8 FEET ADVERSE, INTENSITY DID NOT FADE EXCEPT WHEN DISAPPEARING

It indicates that the object had the appearance of a balloon with a flare, but its shape was up to 7 or 8 feet in size, and its intensity did not fade except when it disappeared.

The text also mentions that three reliable witnesses observed the object, which was estimated to be 300 yards from the observers and traveling at an estimated speed of 600 miles per hour at an altitude of 500 feet. The document states that no photographs were taken.
