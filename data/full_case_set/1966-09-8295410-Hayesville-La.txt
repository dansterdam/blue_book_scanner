The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed letter responding to an observation report regarding an unusual observation on the night of 19 September 1966.

Proposed reply to letter from  21 September 1966

Dear Mr. 

Reference your letter of 21 September 1966 regarding your unusual observation on the night of 19 September 1966. Without additional information a comprehensive study is not possible.

From the submitted information it does appear that the moon could have been responsible for the observation. This would depend on whether you observed this object at 9:30 P.M. CDT or GMT. Since the moon would have been setting at approximately 9:00 GMT on a azimuth of 250 degrees, the one hour would have made a lot of difference. On the 19th, the moon would have been approaching the first quarter which occurred on 21 September 1966.

If you would complete the enclosed Air Force form 14, a more scientific investigation will be possible.

Dear Sir:

ON MONDAY, September 19, 1966 at approximately 9:30 P.M. a teacher-A. D. Williams and a student were conducting routine driving the football squad through and above the trees which appeared to be a most unusual occurence, but a more careful examination showed the object disappeared behind or in the trees.

There was a reflection, but it had a reddish-orange glow and was shaped in the formed of a quarter moon, the size of about car top and approximately 300 feet in width and approx-
imately 150 feet in length.

The object appeared approximately 5 miles South of Keynesville: Louisiana. We think this is worthy of investigation.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
