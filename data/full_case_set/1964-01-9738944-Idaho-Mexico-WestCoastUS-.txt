LAUNCHED TODAY BY THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE FROM VANDENBERG
AIR FORCE BASE, CALIF. THE MISSILE, LAUNCHED BY THE CHINASE, OR ITS
KIND LAUNCHED FROM THIS AEROSPACE CENTER, WAS A ROUTINE
TRAINING LAUNCH BY A STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND MISSILE COMBAT
OPERATIONAL MISSILE. PARA. THE MISSILE LIFTED OFF
FROM ITS SILO LAUNCH FACILITY DURING THE DAWN, DUSK)
AS IT ROSE FROM THE EARTH'S SHADOW INTO THE SUNLIGHT, IT
EFFECT OF AN EXPLOSION, FORMING VARIED COLORED PATTERNS
IN THE SKIES. PRELIMINARY REPORTS INDICATE THAT ONE MIS
IS ON COURSE.(IT IMPACTED IN THE PACIFIC MISSILE RANGE.)
CREW MEMBERS ASSIGNED TO THE (CLINK) MISSILE SQUADRON,
APS, CLAIMS, WERE UNINJURED. NO FILLER MATERIAL IN RESPONSE
QUERY ONLY: QUOTE. VIEWERS OF VISIBLE LAUNCHES IN CERTAIN
AREAS MILES DISTANT FROM LAUNCH SITE, SEE WHAT IS
APPARENTLY A VIOLENT EXPLOSION. PARA. THIS APPARENT
EXPLOSION IS VISIBLE DUE TO THE NATURAL PHENOMENA CAUSED B
THE GRADUAL LESSENING OF DENSITY FROM THE EARTH TO THE OUT
FRINGES OF THE ATMOSPHERE, AND THE PERIOD OF THE DAY WHEN I
OCCURS. PARA. THE DENSITY AFFECTS THE EXHAUST GASES IN THA
THE TRAIL IS HELD IN NARROW CONFINES NEAR THE EARTH, BROAD

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Air Force document, likely related to Project Blue Book, containing textual information about the launch of space vehicles.

AS THE MISSILE LAUNCHES HIGHER INTO SPACE, PARA. THE PERIOD OF
THE DAY IN WHICH THE LAUNCH MAY APPEAR AS AN EXPLOSION IS
USUALLY THE TWILIGHT HOURS BEFORE DAWN OR AFTER SUNSET. AT
THOSE TIMES, THE EARTH'S SHADOW COMBINED WITH THE DENSITY
VARIATION CAUSES REFLECTED RAYS OF SUNLIGHT TO BE VISIBLE
DIFFERENT COLORS. THEN THE EARTH'S SHADOW EXTENDS TO THE RANGE
OF SPACE WHERE THE EXPANSION OF EXHAUST GASES IS MOST RAPID.
PARA. THE EXHAUST TRAIL IS VISIBLE IN EVERY SPACE VEHICLE
WHERE COMBUSTION IS INCOMPLETE. THE STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND
TITAN II 1C3M IS THE ONLY EXCEPTION, SINCE IT HAS ALMOST
COMPLETE COMBUSTION. UNQUOTE. THE ADDITION OF THIS RELEASE
OPTION AND THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR USE IN ANSWER TO
QUERY SHOULD GREATLY LESSEN FUTURE PROBLEMS DURING EVENING
AND PRE-DAWN LAUNCHES.
