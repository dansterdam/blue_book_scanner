SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
SUBJECT: Unidentified, Tulsa, ASD
On 28 September 1959, special Agent Robert N. Anderson, Detachment 102, OCS, AMC, 3800 S. 29th W. Ave., Tulsa, Oklahoma, was dispatched to investigate a complaint that the complainant and her husband had observed an unidentified flying object on that date in the Tulsa, Oklahoma, area. 
The complainants stated that they were driving west on the Turner Turnpike, approximately 10 miles east of Tulsa, on September 28, 1959, when they observed an object in the sky above the horizon traveling in a generally southeasterly direction at a relatively high rate of speed. The object appeared to be round or oval in shape and was emitting a bright reddish-orange light. As the object approached the complainant's position, the light appeared to dim, and at its closest point of approach, the light was barely visible. The object then appeared to accelerate and disappear from view to the southeast. The complainants stated that the object was in sight for approximately 2 minutes.
The information has been forwarded to the Provost Marshal, Third Army, for coordination with Project Blue Book, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.
