TEXT OUTPUT:
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION NOT COVERED IN FORM.

THIS OBJECT WAS A PULSATING LIGHT, OBSERVED THROUGH FOUR COMPLETE CYCLES. THE PERIOD WAS APPROXIMATELY 1.2 SECONDS, AND A ROUGH PERIOD-LUMINOSITY CURVE IS DRAWN BELOW.

THE IDENTITY OF THIS OBJECT CAN BE DEFINITELY ESTABLISHED TO BE THE SAME AS THAT OF THE ONE OBSERVED AT OBOE ASKANIA, BY INTER-COM EXAMINATION INDICATING THE SIGNIFICANT SIMILARITY.

THE OPERATOR WHO CONFIRMED THIS OBSERVATION FROM OBOE ASKANIA STATION WAS:

Transcription of the text in the document:

PART OF
PROJECT BLUE BOOK

APPEARED HORIZONTAL PROJECTION, OBSERVERS BACK TOWARDS FRONT. DISAPPEARED.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand?
(Circle One):
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Nickel
e. Quarter
f. Half dollar

1. Very sure
2. Moderately sure
3. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? BRIGHTNESS FELL OFF AS A FUNCTION OF DISTANCE, UNTIL THE OBJECT BECAME TOO FAINT TO OBSERVE.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? (Do not mention the name of the constructor or where it would give the same appearance as the object that you saw).

IT CANNOT EXTRAPOLATE MUCH MORE, THAN THAT IT WAS A SOURCE OF LIGHT. TO AVOID CONFUSION IT COULD POINT OUT, THAT IT MOST DEFINITELY WAS NOT A METEOR, AND I MUST REFUSE TO GUESS.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" and "B" labeled on it, and a diagram with a central "C" point labeled "MAXIMUM ELEVATION". The second sketch shows a larger view with a person standing in the foreground and a curved horizon line above them. There is also a smaller inset sketch showing an object with the text "OBJECT SWPT OUT APPROXIMATELY 45° IN AZIMUTH".

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
