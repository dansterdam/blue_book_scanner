It appears to be a Project 10073 Record Card from the Project Blue Book, which was a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The card contains information about a UFO sighting that occurred on 6 November 1957 in the North Atlantic Ocean. The card includes details such as the location, date, number of objects observed, and a brief summary of the sighting, which indicates the objects were "very prominent" and appeared to be the "Aurora borealis".
