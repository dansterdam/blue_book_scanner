Dear Sir:-
Here are the pictures of the object reported to this office on May 15, 1959, which was sighted on May 16, 1959. They seem to show a fairly large object hovering over a bridge. The pictures were taken by a witness to the sighting. We would appreciate your evaluation and analysis of these pictures. Let me know if you will need any additional information about this sighting.
You will notice that the object shown in the pictures is not definite or clear. That is because the light was not very bright and the film was not the best quality. 
And you will also note that there are no other objects visible in these pictures to give any sense of scale.
I will not add anything further at this time, and await your reply.
