DATE OF INFORMATION: 25 July 1952
FROM: HEADQUARTERS, AIR MATERIEL COMMAND, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO
TO: DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE, HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE, WASHINGTON 25, D.C.
SUMMARY: On the evening of 25 July 1952, several Air Force personnel observed a group of unidentified objects maneuvering in the sky over Presque Isle Air Force Base, Maine. The objects were described as bright, circular, and capable of high-speed, erratic maneuvers. The sighting lasted approximately 40 minutes.
BASE: Presque Isle Air Force Base, Maine
DATE: 25 July 1952
TIME: 2230-2310 hours
OBSERVATION: The unidentified objects were first observed at approximately 2230 hours on 25 July 1952 by Airman 1/c John E. Dzierzanowski, 36th Air Rescue Squadron, Presque Isle Air Force Base, Maine. The objects were observed maneuvering at high speeds, making erratic turns and dives, and occasionally splitting into smaller groups. The objects were described as bright, circular, and capable of maintaining a constant speed, altitude, and direction.
SUMMARY: The sighting lasted approximately 40 minutes, and was observed by several Air Force personnel, including 1/Lt Arthur J. Stahl, 36th Air Rescue Squadron, and Airman 1/c John E. Dzierzanowski, 36th Air Rescue Squadron. The objects were tracked on radar by the tower controller and the GCI radar station. The tower controller reported that the objects moved at speeds in excess of 500 knots and made abrupt course changes.
The objects were tracked on radar for the duration of the sighting. It was estimated that there were from 10 to 15 objects in the formation. When the sighting ended, the objects disappeared from both visual and radar observation. 
There were no aircraft from Presque Isle Air Force Base or any other known source in the area at the time of the sighting. The weather conditions were clear, with good visibility.

AP 12275758 2-15th A/S Nov 7, 1952, 7:00 p.m. 12 Air Force, Presque Isle, Maine.

TO: TELL (CURT) as of 1800 hours - Last night at about 7:00 p.m. two of our pilots, pilots from the 2nd A/D base, were out on a cross-country routine flight. When north west of Presque Isle, they encountered an object. Here are the details:

Q. What was the speed, altitude, size, shape, color, and general description of the object?
A. One pilot stated that it was moving at a terrific speed, estimated approximately 1000 miles an hour. It was observed at about 30,000 feet altitude. It appeared to be circular in shape, about the size of a saucer, possibly 30-50 feet in diameter. The color was a brilliant white.

Q. Did the object make any sound?
A. No, the object made no sound, as far as the pilots could determine.

Q. Did the pilots attempt to overtake the object?

A. It seemed to be a solid, metallic object, and it appeared to be something concrete rather than a mirage or reflection. The pilots reported that it was real and not something imaginary or hallucinated.

Q. What was the pilots' reaction to the object?
A. The pilots were obviously amazed at the tremendous speed, the maneuverability, and the fact that it was completely unidentified. They could offer no explanation as to what the object was.

Q. What would you estimate the speed to have been?
A. It is estimated that the speed was at least 1000 miles an hour. The pilots stated that it was completely outpacing their jet fighters.

Q. And the size?
A. The size was estimated to be approximately 30-50 feet in diameter, circular in shape.

Q. And the altitude?
A. The altitude was estimated to be approximately 30,000 feet.

25 JULY 1952

FOR: Director of Intelligence, USAF
Washington 25, D.C.
FROM: 6th District Office of Special Investigations
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS SIGHTINGS

DETAILS: According to Captain REDWUS, Air Force Base, Ohio,
on 23 July 1952, the Air Force radar at Lockbourne, Ohio, 
detected unidentified objects in flight over the Columbus, Ohio, 
area. The radar operators said they detected between 8 and 12
unidentified objects. They reported that the objects appeared to
be flying in loose formation, changed speed and direction abruptly,
and attained very high speeds estimated from 1200 to 1800 miles
per hour. The Air Force radar continued to track the objects over 
a period of about 2 1/2 hours. Other GCI and fighter-interceptor 
radar sites in the area also tracked the objects.

Captain REDWUS reported that this incident represented the third
time within the past two weeks that the Lockbourne radar had picked
up similar unidentified objects.

The following information was furnished this office by the 6th OSI District (ID), Robins Air Force Base, Robins Field, Georgia:

"Captain EUGENE E. McMANUS, AC-66650S, 511th Operations Squadron, 511th Air Base Group, Turner AFB, Ga., reported to this office on 24 July 1952 that on 23 July 1952, while testing and awaiting clearance from Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, to conduct a training flight, he and his wingman observed four silvery, circular aerial objects located in the vicinity of Lockbourne AFB and Lockbourne ARS, Ohio. Captain McMANUS stated that these objects were easily visible to him, and that there were four (4) in number. Capt. McMANUS further stated that one of the objects seemed to hover above the other three objects and shoot red and green lights which appeared similar to bursts of small arms fire. Capt. McMANUS observed these objects for approximately 15 minutes and described them as being round in shape and almost fluorescent white in color. He added that he arranged himself so that he could sight the objects through the plexiglass dome of his aircraft. Capt. McMANUS stated that the objects did not seem to have any forward motion, but rather seemed to be stationary or hovering. He could not determine the exact size of the objects, but stated they appeared somewhat larger than a C-54 aircraft. Capt. McMANUS further added that weather conditions from Lockbourne AFB set up an observer telescope".

the type used in reading weather balloons, and that he, personally, observed these objects through this telescope. He continued that with the assistance of this telescope the objects still appeared round in shape and white in color. The only assistance that these objects received was too much larger. Capt McMANUS further stated that it was reported to Lockbourne Operations while he was there, that an Observatory in Columbus, Ohio, through means of triangulation, had placed the height of these objects at 75,000 feet. Capt McMANIS stated that he did not see any vapor trails or landing and that in his opinion they flew rapidly without sound and were between six to approxmately six inches in diameter.

Herewith McMANIS: Capt. McMANIS is a senior pilot in the United States Air Force having approximately 2,200 flying time, and having been a pilot for approximately ten (10) years. Captain McMANIS is described by his fellow officers as being quiet, very conscientious, and most reliable.

SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENA OVER LORING AIR FORCE BASE, MAINE

As the observer, and the object did not come in close enough for a positive identification, they were unable to determine specific details regarding the object. It was described as approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter, oval in shape, with a vertical row of 5 to 8 bright blue-white lights rotating around the perimeter. The object was first observed at an altitude of approximately 500 feet, moving in a straight line at a speed of 40 to 50 knots. After approximately 60 seconds, the object reversed its direction and climbed rapidly out of sight. Ground observers were able to track the object through binoculars. Captain XXXXXX XXXXXX, who reported the sighting, stated that it was unlike any conventional aircraft he had ever seen. No other specifics about the size, shape or performance capabilities of the object were provided. The report concludes that the object remains unidentified.

The image provided does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The document appears to be an interview or questionnaire, with a series of questions and corresponding responses.

Text extracted from the document:

This is a case report of an object seen by John R. Doe. 

Mr. Doe was driving a car. I was going too. I saw what I at first thought was an aircraft on fire. 

What made you think it was an aircraft on fire? 

It appeared to be glowing reddish-orange.

How high up was it? 

It was relatively low, perhaps 1000 to 2000 feet up.

In what direction was it moving? 

It was moving in a straight line, in a northeast direction.

What did the object look like? 

It appeared to be round or oval in shape.

How long did you watch the object? 

I watched it for about 3 to 5 minutes.

Was the object visible all the time? 

Yes, it was visible the entire time I observed it.

What happened to the object? 

It appeared to fade out as it moved across the sky.

What other comments would you make about this incident?

It's strange character of the glow, and the fact that it seemed to just fade out, are the most unusual aspects.
