Dear Sirs:

Please send me the Air Force news release concerned with the sightings caused by the Country Weather Television.

Also would you please answer this question? 
Was the reason for the report of UFOs on Sept 25, 1962 also caused by the ground lights of the television station as mentioned in the previous sighting? I would like to know if the report has been proven true, what the actual cause was, and if any investigation is continuing on the sightings.

Thank you.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature redacted]
