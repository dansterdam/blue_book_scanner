Information via Optical Character Recognition (OCR):

INFORMATION VIA BRANTFORD, ONTARIO, CANADA -SJC NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, CANADA -CANADIAN RESEARCH BRANCH. 

Observation Summery: Please be advised that a Ground of Canadian Air Force personnel located at Clinton, Ontario, Canada, on Sept. 7, 1964 at approx. 1:00 A.M., observed an object in the sky which they consider to be a conventional fighter aircraft. However, this object was apparently larger and travelling at a much higher speed than normal fighter aircraft are capable of. This object was apparently of a triangular shape and emitting a blue-green flame from its rear. it was travelling in a North-North-East direction in a horizontal flight, at an elevation of approx. 45 degrees. The observation lasted for approximately 2-3 minutes and the object faded from sight. 

The Space Object:
The object or rocket is said to have hit Lake Fraser, about 300 yards from the western shore of western Canada. The object is said to have left a trail of smoke or vapour, approximately 4-5 miles in length, as it descended into the lake. Eyewitnesses in the area reported that the object was approximately 30-40 feet in length and appeared to be of a triangular shape. Also, the object is reported to have emitted a blue-green flame from its rear as it descended. Supposedly, the object struck the water with a loud explosion and caused a large geyser of water to be thrown into the air. Subsequent investigation in the area has failed to turn up any physical evidence that an object did in fact strike the lake. However, traces of some sort of heavy fibrous material, resembling glass fiber, have been found in the general impact area. The Canadian Government is reportedly very interested in this incident and an intensive investigation is currently underway.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Project Blue Book: the Chief of the Athabasca Indians reports that the object was seen on February 5, 1954 by the Athabasca Indians near Faust, Alberta, Canada. It was observed for about 5 minutes. The object was described as circular, about 60 feet in diameter, and traveling at a high rate of speed. The object is reported to have taken off in a northerly direction. The document discusses the Athabasca Indians' sighting and their report to the U.S. Air Force regarding the incident.

Pt. 5

At about 2130 hours, while returning home, I
observed a brilliant white light in the sky. It appeared to
be about 45 degrees above the horizon and was slowly
moving westward. After watching it for several minutes,
I noticed that it appeared to split into two separate lights,
one larger than the other. These two lights began to move
erratically and dance around each other.

After watching this for a short while, the larger
light suddenly dimmed and appeared to descend rapidly.
The smaller light then began to move rapidly up and down
and from side to side. This continued for several more
minutes until the smaller light finally disappeared.

The whole incident lasted about 10 to 15 minutes.

This report has been handwritten on what appears to be an official form or document. The text appears to be a detailed description of a UFO sighting, likely part of the Project Blue Book reports.

Sirs:

Please be advised that the ATHABASCA INDIANS near FORT McMURRAY, Alberta, in western Canada, recently reported seeing a strange object in the sky.

According to recent reports from a group of Indians in the area, the object was described as a bright light, which hovered over the Athabasca River for about 15 minutes, and then moved off at a high rate of speed. The Indians state that the object may have made a sound, possibly a 'hissing' sound, but this is said to be unreliable.

The RCMP is of the opinion that this appears to be another UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) that has been seen in the area of Athabasca, Alberta. Previous reports of UFO sightings in this district have been received by the RCMP.

The object is said to be approximately 20 miles from FORT McMURRAY, Alberta, (N.W.T.) in the northwest.

REPORT BY WITNESS MR. C ------- 

AT ABOUT 9.00 P.M. ON DECEMBER 27TH, 1959, I WAS WATCHING TV IN THE LIVING ROOM OF MY HOME IN BURNABY, B.C., CANADA, WHEN SOMETHING CAUGHT MY EYE OUTSIDE THE WINDOW. ON LOOKING OUT I SAW A STRANGE OBJECT IN THE SKY.

THE OBJECT WAS A BRILLIANTLY LIT UP DISC-SHAPED CRAFT, ABOUT 75 TO 100 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT WAS HOVERING SILENTLY OVER THE ROOFTOPS OF THE NEARBY HOUSES, ABOUT 1500 FEET AWAY FROM ME.

THE CRAFT WAS ILLUMINATED BY A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM UNDERNEATH IT. THERE WERE NO ENGINES OR PROPELLERS VISIBLE. THE LIGHT FLICKERED SLIGHTLY BUT REMAINED STEADY.

I CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME IT REMAINED STATIONARY AND DID NOT MOVE. THEN IT BEGAN TO SLOWLY MOVE AWAY, ACCELERATED RAPIDLY, AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT WITHIN ABOUT 10 SECONDS.

THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR AND THERE WAS LITTLE WIND. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS OBJECT BEFORE. IT DID NOT RESEMBLE ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT.

I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE R.C.M.P. THE NEXT DAY."

Text found in the document:

Investigation (British Columbia)
23rd USAF FAG (REDCOM)
Levair, Mines
Reference letter from committer, Chief of Kavat News Agency, London, England.
Mr. states in his letter that it was reported to the agency that a "strange object" was sighted in British Columbia. The object was reported to the RCAF.  It was a clear moonlit night and the object was observed from a distance of approximately 50 degrees. The object was struck a lake from a trajectory of about 25 degrees and immediately bounced. It then remained stationary for a short time and then took off at an extremely high velocity and was not visible from the air due to heavy woods. The RCMP were notified and an investigation conducted.
That this information was from the Royal Mounted Police who received it via Surrattes national news Agency of London, England.
An unidentified flying object sighted on 11 Feb 60 from Nanaimo, B.C. and the object supposedly on the ground in British Columbia on 11 Feb 60. The identity of the object exists and if so, the identity.
It states that an investigation was conducted through the United States Meteorological Office in Canada to determine the following:
Was a report of this alleged object forwarded to the Canadian authorities?

- page 27 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Are the identities of the witnesses knowo
Has the offiaial investigation been completed
Was the object located?
Was the report originated by the Royal Mounted Police?
If the object was located, what was its specific purpose?
What was the direction from which the object came?
If the object was identified, what were the conclusions of the investigation?
What are the dimensions and other descriptions of the object?
Is the Canadian Government aware of any occurrence?
There are a number of factors which tend to discredit this report. The envelope is postmarked Davenport, Iowa (attachment nr 2) which is located over 1500 miles from the place of occurrence and would have been hard to investigate in 1959. Tribes would have ripped a watch through woods that could have been hidden by trees. The object was a possible a ball of fire or meteor. The statement that the Athabaskan Indian 'tribes are very primitive and superstitious' suggests that this report is a hoax, but an inquiry will be conducted to resolve this matter further.
