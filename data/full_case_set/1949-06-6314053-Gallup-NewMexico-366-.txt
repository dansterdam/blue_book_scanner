The object veiled the object to be between 250 and 170 miles per hour in speed, and the object travelled on a level plane made no maneuvers. In both of this observation incidents the weather was clear and the light conditions were good, both interviews were conducted on 23 May 1949, and reports were submitted directly to HQ.

The image provided does not contain any photographs; it is a page from a text document, which appears to be a report from Project Blue Book—an official United States Air Force investigation into UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) sightings.

The text on the document is partially redacted, but I will transcribe the visible portions:

**[Redacted]**

5. On 20 May 1949, object was sighted by [redacted] in [redacted] flying on his back at two thousand five hundred feet near [redacted] New Orleans, La. [redacted] stated that as the object moved in a curved path he was lying on his back at two thousand five hundred feet near Camp Leroy [redacted] New Orleans, La. and sighted upward toward the object. He believes the [redacted] Colonel in the Air Force reserve who is located at [redacted] corp. He stated he first saw only one object, but as it moved closer objects grouped around a larger one. The new objects had a shiny, being silver in color. Shape was flat but objects were described as a convex upside. Observer could not be estimated, but approximately it could have covered only 25 minutes. The weather was clear with unlimited visibility. Objects moved in a large circle over New Orleans airport. No sound or odor was noticed, and after moving on a horizontal axis, the object disappeared. Report furnished by Fourth Army Air to ACIC. Copy retained in File DD #10.

6. On 21 May 1949, between the hours of 2105 and 2100 CST, several persons observed unusual objects in the air above Dallas, Texas. The weather report for this period was as follows:

"Weather Report: 21 May 1949, U. S. Department of Commerce, Weather Bureau, Dallas, Texas: 2030 hours close city, visibility 15 miles, pressure 1005.7 millibars, temperature 79°, dew point 62, NNE wind two miles per hour, 29.69 altimeter, frequent cloud to cloud lightning.

"2130 hours, clear sky, 15 miles visibility, 1004.5 millibars, 75° temperature, 56° dew point, NNE wind at five miles per hour, altimeter 29.72, frequent cloud to cloud lightning SE.

These objects were flat, circular in shape like a smoke ring, were smaller than a man's fist held at arm's length. Objects appeared to be approximately 1-1/2 miles away and were moving from east to west. They were so dim that for approximately three seconds, moving at a speed estimated to be 600 to 1,000 miles per hour. A W5 stat that they were very dim, just enough to see, about like a 5 watt light globe. No maneuvers were observed and no sound or odor noted. Interrogator stated

Objects were described as being about half the size of a man's fist 
at arm's length, were fluorescent white in color, with silvery occlus - 
tion. Shape of the objects were circular, with comparatively mone-
like a clam shell. The objects were 2-1/2 to 3 miles from this observer 
when first seen, and were in sight for approximately 20 minutes. A very 
good estimate, as the objects rose perpendicular until they were a 
faded glitter, being about 10 miles directly above. The objects made a 
spiral climb, being slow in circles per outward time. --- --- agreed 
in his estimation that objects rose to a fall out in any one spot like 
Office Department, and a close-clos man. Interrogator stated what is is 
sincere and appeared interested in the matter and expressed himself very 
well.

Texas was interviewed and stated that at 2045 hours, from the front yar-

head with a round object in the cncter, and were about the size of a 50¢ 
piece held at arm's length. Color varied from that of red and orange and 
the objects were in sight from three to six seconds. The objects did 
not reflect light, but appeared to be translucent, all were moving at an 
estimated speed of 1,500 to 30,000 miles per hour arily flying in a fixed curve 
toward east, south-east. Ir. ----, has an iq ... ... made in question and 
and according to the interrogator, has an intelligence and character in keep- 
Ing with that of his profession. Copies of report form 'Guide to Inves- 
tigation - Unidentified aerial Objects' furnished to A:C by Fourth Army. 
Copy of these reports retained in files of I/O #10.

10. On 1 June 1949, this office received a letter from Asst. Chief

seconds and appeared to be 50 miles away from the observer. It appeared
to be a spheroid in shape and was described as being orange in color as
seen against the deep blue sky. The brilliance was out of all 60 watt
light bulb at 100 yards, with the object being about 1/3 the diameter
at arm's length. In this instance a trail of white emission with the

The document is marked as "UNCLASSIFIED" at the bottom. Various other pieces of information, such as dates and locations (all relating to May 1949 and locations in Texas and Louisiana), indicate that they concern investigations into "Unidentified Aerial Objects", which is consistent with what you'd expect from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was the U.S. Air Force's investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs).
