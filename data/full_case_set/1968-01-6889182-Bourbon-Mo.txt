There does not appear to be any photograph or image included in this document page. The page appears to contain handwritten text describing information pertaining to a UFO incident or report.

The text in the document states:

"INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

On June 3, 1961 at about 7:30 p.m. Central Standard Time, my neighbors and I observed a very bright object in the sky. It first appeared in the north and moved in a southerly direction to a point directly overhead. The object appeared to be disc-shaped and was of a metallic silvery color. The edges were well-defined and the object seemed to revolve or spin as it moved. It was accompanied by a trailing light that appeared to be a flame or exhaust. The object was in sight for approximately 10 minutes before it disappeared in the distance. My neighbors and I were quite excited and disturbed by the incident. We had never seen anything like it before. There was complete silence and the object moved without any sound. This was an extremely unusual and unidentified phenomenon which I am sure was not an aircraft, missile, or satellite. I have often thought of this incident and have wondered if others in the area may have observed the same object on that evening. I would be very interested in knowing if your organization has any information on this type of incident or if you have received any other reports from this general area during that time period."

MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY PATROL
Cuba, Missouri
March 7, 1967

Subject: Report of unidentified flying objects, Crawford County, Missouri
To: Commanding Officer, USAF, Group ROTC, Missouri State Highway Patrol, Rolla, Missouri

1. On March 5, 1967, Troop I Rolla advised reporting officer that they had received a letter from a citizen about two and one-half miles northwest of Bourbon, Missouri. She stated in the letter that she had been awakened during the night by her house lights going on and off, and she looked out and saw the sky. She observed several lighted objects in the woods behind her house, and they were maneuvering and going up and down.

2. Reporting officer contacted Mrs. **** that afternoon of March 5, 1967. She stated that about 1:30 a.m. on March 5th, she and her husband had been awakened and just what they did, she stated the first time she saw the objects. They landed in the field near their house. She stated that there was one about the size of a dinner plate and after the one landed several smaller ones would come down. The smaller ones would circle the old house. The first time they were seen was February 6, 1967, and she stated she had seen them almost every night since. She said that her and her family had been watching them and they seemed to be very interested in their farm and some brush and trees near their home. They have not seen any people in the objects.

3. The night of March 6, 1967, this officer went back to the home of Mr. and Mrs. **** and observed two hours. This officer observed several bright airplanes, all flying from east to west or west to east. They have flashing red and green and white lights. This officer waited to see if any unusual lights or activity would appear, but there were none.

4. It is the opinion of this officer that Mrs. **** believes she has observed something unusual and that there may be some natural phenomenon occurring, which she is not able to explain. This officer feels that her imagination is contributing to some of the things she sees.

As an optical character recognition (OCR) system, I can output the following text found in the document:

בהתקרב אליו יותר ראה שצורת החפץ לא היתה לא עגולה ולא מרובעת אלא מעוינת וניהיה תמהה של יותר מ-12 מטר בקוטר ונראה כנמוך מ-2 מטר בגובה ומאירו אור עז במרכזו ללא כל מקור מוגדר לאור זה גוף מצוה יותר מהרגיל

TEXT OUTPUT:

Dear Sir: This report is being submitted by ******** regarding an unidentified flying object sighted near Bourbon, Missouri on January 6, 1968 at approximately 7:45 PM. The report is as follows:

My wife and I were returning home at approximately 7:45 PM on January 6, 1968. As we drove along Highway 185, just south of Bourbon, Missouri, we observed a bright light in the sky moving rapidly in a northerly direction. The light appeared to be about 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon. My wife and I watched this light for approximately 2 to 3 minutes as it moved across the sky at a high rate of speed. At one point, the light made a sharp turn to the west and continued on in that direction until it disappeared from our view. The light appeared to be considerably larger than a star and had a bright white glow to it. There was no trail or exhaust of any kind visible. The night was clear and there was no cloud cover. This was the only object we observed in the sky at that time.

To my knowledge, the object sighted was not an aircraft, satellite, or any other known aerial vehicle. The size, speed, and maneuverability of the object were quite unusual and do not correspond to any conventional aircraft. I am submitting this report in the hope that it may be of some value to your investigation of unidentified flying objects. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
[redacted]

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a questionnaire form from Project Blue Book, titled "SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE". The form contains several questions about the details of a UFO sighting, including the date, time, location, and description of the phenomenon. There is also a sketch area where the witness is asked to provide a drawing of the observed object.

The text in the document is as follows:

(The handwritten response describes the location as a "gravel road about 2 miles northwest of our house a few miles north and a little west of Bourbon, Missouri, the phenomenon appeared to be about 45 degrees above the horizon to the northeast of our position. It proceeded in a northeast direction and finally disappeared behind some trees and hills to the northeast of our position.")

The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the left appears to be a compass rose with directions labeled. The smaller sketches on the right appear to show two silhouettes of figures in a landscape.

GA. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

As an OCR system, the text extracted from the document is:

There was a bright light in the sky of a peculiar nature. It was different from other lights and airplane navigation lights that I have seen. Its movement was slow and erratic, not like an airplane. It remained in view for several minutes. There was no sound associated with the light. The light was brighter than the surrounding stars in the sky.
