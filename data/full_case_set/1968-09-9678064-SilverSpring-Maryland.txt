The image contains two illustrations. The top illustration is a compass-like diagram with various directional labels. The bottom illustration shows two landscape scenes, one with a person standing in a road surrounded by mountains, and the other showing a more distant landscape view.

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE SIX INCHES AWAY FROM THIS COMPASS. YOU SEE IT PLACED ON A TABLE. HOW WOULD YOU POSITION THE COMPASS TO ALIGN WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON? PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON IS MOVING.

THE SKETCH BELOW SHOWS ILLUSTRATIVE REPRESENTATIONS OF OBSERVATIONS MADE NEAR THE TIME THAT THE PHENOMENON WAS SEEN BOTH CLOSE AND AT A DISTANCE. NOTE THAT THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT IS SCHEMATICALLY SHOWN BY THE ARROWS AND IT IS REFERRED TO AS BEING BETWEEN "A" AND "B", THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE FROM "A" TO "B" OR FROM "B" TO "A". REFER TO MAGNETIC NORTH AS AN EXAMPLE.

[Handwritten text:] The object was a solid round white light, about 3 inches in diameter, emitting light or luminosity from its body. There was no flash-ing, it was steady in its flight, except for a slight oscillation to the left and right. It flew in a straight line across the sky in about 15 seconds and disappeared. There were no other lights or objects associated with it. The object was on the horizon in front of me and shot across the sky at an angle above the horizon of perhaps 10 degrees. The sighting was in daylight and the sun was visible, slightly to my left.

A little over a year ago, the I came across an interesting story about a local glass company in Silver Spring, Maryland that had an unusual experience with a bright saucer shaped object in the sky. The incident occurred at 11:30 a.m. on September 9, 1968 and it was observed by five employees of the glass company. 

The object is described as silver in color, elliptical in shape, with no visible protrusions or appendages. It hovered in the sky for about 3 to 5 minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight. The object did not make any sound and appeared to be metallic in nature. The five witnesses were able to get a good look at the object and one of them even got close enough to estimate its size as being about 30 feet in diameter. 

This incident was reported to the local police and an investigation was subsequently conducted by the US Air Force's Project Blue Book program. The report indicates that the Air Force was unable to provide a conclusive explanation for the sighting, classifying it as "unidentified".
