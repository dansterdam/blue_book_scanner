Dear Re

I am returning the slide taken by D——as you wish. According to my analysis, this photo is a genuine UFO slide. I find multiple reflections of some sort.

Sincerely,

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document page from a Project Blue Book report, with the heading "UNCLASSIFIED" and some text describing an analysis of a UFO case from Mexico.

UNCLASSIFIED

SUBJECT: UFO (MEXICO)
ANALYST: MAJOR QUINTANILLA
Pt: BURTON
DATE: 20 JAN 66

Analysis was requested on a 35mm slide containing three light-toned images similar in appearance, taken near Guadalajara, Mexico, and forwarded to the Photo Analysis Division (TDPA) and Photo Processing Division (TDPPE) with the following results:

No discernible signature could be derived from the images noted on the film. Low contrast is a characteristic that the images were probably caused by a ray of light entering a camera, or possibly from some lens flare if one was used.

The image appears to contain a scanned document, but there is no photograph present. The document appears to be a letter describing an encounter with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during a trip to Mexico. The letter mentions that the writer's son-in-law and daughter saw the objects and took pictures, which are enclosed with the letter. However, the image provided does not contain any photographs, only the text of the letter.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Unidentified Flying Objects Devision
Wright Patterson Airforce Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs,

I am enclosing a slide which has on it 3 unidentified flying objects.

About a month ago my son in law, [redacted], and daughter, [redacted], were traveling in Mexico. They went west of Guadalajara, to the Pacific coast, and took pictures, including the enclosed. The enclosed was in a primitive area, where they took pictures of a river and primitive dwellings. 

They saw no aircraft, heard no aircraft, and were sure they were far from any beaten path.

When we were watching the slides, we were surprised to see on this slide the 3 objects. I have shown them to several people, and also had 2 5 by 7 enlargements made, and looked at them via microscopes. No one could identify them.

I am enclosing the slide, which you may want an enlargement made to.

Although I would like to know about it, if you were to give it publicity.

[redacted] is a well known teacher from Eastern Kentucky Teachers College and has never been interested in flying objects, nor has his wife.

They couldn't have made an enlargement or said anything, but I thought it should be followed up to some conclusion.

Please inform me if there is any explanation for the objects.

Sincerely,

[redacted]

P.S. I have been an army chaplain and have Major General's commission from U.W.Z.
