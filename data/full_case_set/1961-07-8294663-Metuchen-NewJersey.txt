There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book UFO report, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR system, the text from the document is as follows:

"Metuchen, N. J.
July 8, 1961

On July 8, 1961 at approximately 2:30 P.M. a bright luminous object appeared to me. This object hovered over the area for approximately five minutes and then suddenly shot straight up and disappeared from view. The object appeared to be oval in shape, and all to be luminous or light in color. It made no sound as it hovered or shot up. I have never seen a phenomena like this before. Could this be a U.F.O.? I would like to know if any other sightings have been recorded in this vicinity around the same time.

Sincerely yours,
(redacted)"
