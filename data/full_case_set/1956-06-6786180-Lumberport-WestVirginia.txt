Late in the afternoon I seen
an object over "L.B.I." I don't

not. But, in 1953, June, three miles
west of here, I seen an oblong
object, like a cigar, white, standing
dead in a altitude of 500 ft. at
the speed of a one-engine airplane its
shape (shown below).

Sincerely yours,

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting                                           26 APR 1960

1. The attached letter from Master [REDACTED] is a brief description of a sighting which he experienced in June 1955.

2. This is a very old case, and will probably not be of much benefit to the Air Force. In addition, the facts of the case are probably very fuzzy in the witnesses memory.

3. It is suggested that a questionnaire, ATIC Form #164, be sent to Master [REDACTED]. Sending this form may prevent much future correspondence with the witness concerning the sighting.

4. Master [REDACTED] address is as follows:

Master [REDACTED] 
Lumberport, W. Va.
