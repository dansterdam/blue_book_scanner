La Rochel air case
Dory, France

Gentlemen:

On 16 September 55, a Fishing sroup from St Gilles Croix de Vie, France, while fishing in the channel between the Ile d'Yeu and the mainland, observed a strange aerial phenomenon. The report, as obtained from the French Gendermarie (sic) files, is as follows:
At about 1530 hours, the members of the fishing group observed an object maneuvering at a very high altitude, estimated at about 30,000 feet. The object appeared to be circular in shape, and seemed to be revolving or spinning. The object was estimated to be about 80 feet in diameter and was very bright, almost blinding. After about 5 minutes the object suddenly disappeared from view.
This report is submitted for your information and filer.
