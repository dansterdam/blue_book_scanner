ARMSTRONG advised that this radar station tracked an outbound aircraft from about
1630 hours, 30 September 1949, which appeared to originate in the vicinity of
Makapuu. Force Base, and traveled towards the sea at about 1150 for a distance 
of approximately 10 miles and then assumed a course of 072° where it was tracked until
about 1745 hours. For a distance of about 172 miles. The estimated speed of this
aircraft was 150 miles per hour. No report covering an object floating in a northeasterly direction from this base was noted by the Kahuku radar station. Major
ARMSTRONG also advised that he had checked the Oahu Navy Radar Unit (Schoefield),
and was advised that this station was not in operation at 1700 hours, 30 September 1949. Mr. A. A. ALEXANDER, Operations Clerk, Detachment VT-2, US Navy, Honolulu 
International Airport advised that Navy Mars (JRM) Flying Boat departed that station
enroute to the mainland United States at 1630 hours, 30 September 1949, and the 
usual route followed by this aircraft would closely approximate that plotted by 
the 6th Alternate Control & Warning Squadron. The large flying boats travel 
at a slower speed than the usual C-54 aircraft; the cruising speed being between
150 to 180 miles per hour.

13. ACSI Letter No. 85, 12 August 1949, (Classified Confidential), has been 
utilized in compiling date.

14. Files presently available to SID (IC) PACD MAJTS, APO 953, reflect the 
following previous reports of unidentified flying objects:

a. Agent Report dated 20 October 1948, SUBJECT: "Flight Disc by 
SA BAYNE P. SCURLOCK, last Counter Intelligence Unit, Pacific Air 
Command, APO 953, as follows:

On 19 October 1948, this Agent, accompanied by Special Agent
RIDLEN, drove to 7137 Pacific Heights Road, the Honolulu resi-
dence of Major ROBERT C. DUM, AO 431328, Deputy Chief of Civil-
ion COmponents, Pacific AIr Command, APO 935. This trip was made 
with the hopes of observing a similar incident observed by 
Major DUMB the previous afternoon from his home, that of "fluttering 
discs". Major DUM stated that on the afternoon of 18 October 
1948, at approximately 1705 hours, while lying on the lawn with 
his 8 yr. old daughter, he observed what appeared to be a strang-
ly shaped, silver, glistening object high in the sky, in a northe-
erly direction. The distance from the object was traveling in a north-
ary direction. The object at 30,000 feet altitude. At about this 
particular time of day, the Major stooted, a stratus layer of clouds
was situated above the flying object at an approximate altitude of
14,000 feet. The "discs" were moving below this layer of clouds.
Because of lower broken cumulus clouds at a very low altitude,
moving in a southwesterly direction, the Major was not certain
whether he saw the same "disc" on four (4) different occasions or 
four (4) different "discs". Covering a period of ten (10) minutes
the "discs" (or disc) were observed each time for approximately
ten (10) seconds. On first observing the strange objects, Major 
DUM called it to the attention of his wife and 8 yr old daughter.
When asked what they had seen the previous afternoon, Mrs. DUM
and the small daughter, LINDA, agreed exactly the same observation 
as stated above by the Major. Major DUMB compared the

"Hdiscf" with a silver dollar slightly turned from a flat position, flying at a disc-shape, and held at an arms length at a forty-five (45) degree angle above the eye level. Major DRUM stated further that he did not observe any exhaust smoke, flame, vapor trails, or accompanying noises. The informant indicated that he was certain that the object was not a conventional type aircraft. At 1610 hours, on 19 October 1948, this Agent..and a SA RIDE set began a visual search of the sky areas pointed out by Major DRUM. This search from the lawn of Major DRUM's residence, occasionally employing field glasses, was constant until 1800 hours, when solid, low, cumulus clouds made further observation of the sky area impossible. During this period, nothing that steht even resemble an airplane or "discf" was observed by these Agents.

No other information concerning this incident appears in files examined.

The image provided appears to be a scanned photocopy of a map, rather than a photograph. It shows a detailed drawing of an area, which seems to be a layout of a bay area with various marked sections, possibly a military installation or an airfield considering the shapes that resemble runways.

There is a compass rose indicating orientation, with the top of the map corresponding to the north direction. The representation includes contour lines that likely indicate elevation changes in the landscape. There are also symbols, structures, and possibly roads. "UNCLASSIFIED" is labeled at the top and bottom of the map within a border margin.

Unfortunately, due to the quality of the photocopy and the scanning process, extracting the text with precision is not feasible. The text is too blurred and illegible to provide an OCR-like rendition of the content shown in the image.

Sgt Curtis stated that he heard a jet aircraft in the vicinity at the same time that the object was sighted. The jet sound
seemed to be paralleling the path of the object sighted.

2. Three (3) F-8lu# of the 14th Fighter Group were enroute from Dow Air Force Base to Griffiss Air Force Base at time of reported incident and passed on course very near West Paris, Maine at 1000 hours. It is probable that Sgt Curtis saw these aircraft.

GUIDE TO INVESTIGATION (Cont'd) UNCLASSIF/FRN Incident No. ___

21. Manner of disappearance. Just disappeared from sight due to flying___
away from the city lights.

22. Effect on clouds: There were no clouds at that time.

23. Additional information concerning object: The objects were in the
formation of ducks flying south for the winter, as a cold wave was on
the way at time. It is the opinion of the observer that the objects were
ducks flying south to get to the warmer elevation approximately 40 miles
south of Lubbock, and were flying faster than they usually fly.

24. Weather conditions and light at time of sighting! Clear with a cold wave
approaching Lubbock.

25. Name and address of observer:    Lubbock, Texas

Investigation initiated by District Commander, DO #13. On
14 September 1949, Mr. *EBRT ******** observed a shiny object
in the northeast about twenty miles awasy. The object was
about 25 feet ovbrall and consisted of an eight foot disk sus-
ported by an eight foot win*-like structure on opposite sides
which apparently provided noulsion. The object moved direct-
ly overhead maintining; a strait* course at an altitude of
8,000 to 10,000 feet and a speed of 400-500 *P*, Object was
sighted in conjunction with a four-engine bomber which was
later identified as flying on a training course at much
lower altitude. The object was in view 60 to 90 seconds and
finally disappeared behind a line of hills in the southw*st.
The weather was clear with thin scattered clouds at 20,000
feet with a visibility of 25 miles.

The black bar over the word "UNCLASSIFIED" is part of the declassification process and does not obscure any other text.

This image does not contain a photograph. Instead, it features a schematic or hand-drawn map with annotations. The visible text and markings on the document include:

- The title at the top, which seems to be partially cut off, reads "SCOTIA BL[...] ATHBONA & MONT MONT".
- There are dashed and solid lines seemingly representing an object's flight path, and there is some text along these lines, although parts of it are difficult to decipher due to the quality of the image.
- Near the center, there is a text label that reads "Flight Path", with an arrow indicating direction.
- To the right, there is a label "object" with a dashed line pointing to a small "X".
- Near the bottom left, there is a shape that represents an "observer", and this is connected to the object path by a solid line.
- The distance annotation reads "(Approx 20 mi.)" placed along the dashed line suggesting distance from the observer to the object.
- There is also some text at the bottom of the image that reads "Dec 24-48", which could indicate a date, December 24, 1948.

Please note that the image quality is poor and the details may not be completely accurate. The transcription provided is based on the visible and legible parts of the image.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch, not a photograph. The sketch appears to resemble some sort of object, possibly a flying craft, with a more slender upper part and a circular lower part.

There is faint text at the bottom of the page, which seems to say "NEGATIVE OKAY," but due to the low contrast and faintness, it is not very clear. There is no other text displayed in the document image provided.

Special Inquiry - Unconventional Aircraft

REFERENCE

SYNOPSIS

An investigation conducted to develop additional information regarding the observation of an unknown flying object on 10 September 1949 near Boston, New York, indicates that three witnesses sighted this flying object from ten to fifteen seconds. Excellent weather conditions enabled witnesses to follow object's westerly course, without interruption or obstruction. With the exception of the object's position in flight, the information of observers agreed. Attention is invited to the qualifications of witnesses. One witness is employed an operator of farm and are also employed by industrial firms situated in Buffalo, New York. Employment investigation reflects that witnesses are considered reliable, loyal, and trustworthy. However, both male witnesses have completed only the equivalent of seven (7) school grades. In conclusion, further investigation failed to reveal other observers, radar tracing, or experimental operations being conducted in this area during the incident period.

Synopsis

Investigation initiated by District Commander, 13th OSI
District. On 15 September 1949, Mr. ***** and
two witnesses saw an unidentified object moving over
Scottsbluff Monument, approximately six miles away. Object
appeared to be spinning and wavering slightly from
side to side, emitting a bright light, which was apparently
the sun shining off the sides of the object. The object
appeared to have about the same average dimensions
as an automobile tire and wheel, was at an altitude of approximately 2500 feet, was in sight about two minutes, and
finally disappeared from view over the Monument. The
weather was clear with a visibility of 50 miles.

This observer seems to be dependable, steady and earnest in his
belief that he saw this object. He has not previously made any reports
of unidentified object sightings.

Did observer wear glasses, especially polaroid glasses at time of sight-
ing, or was object viewed through canopy, window, or other transparent
material?

No glasses were worn by the observer. The object was viewed thru
plexiglass nose of B-29.

15. Velocity (time to cover given angular distance.)
The object was travelling well over five hundred (500) miles per hour.
Observers have seen fast-moving conventional type aircraft on numerous
occasions, but the object moved so quickly that it was completely out of
view in a matter of seconds.

16. Sound and odor
No sound nor odor was noticed.

17. Trail (color, length, width, persistence, etc.)
No trail nor any other distinguishing characteristics noticed by observers.

18. Luminosity (visible by reflection, incandescence, other - degree of
brilliance.)
No lumnious characteristics noticed by the observers.

19. Projections (fins, wings, rods, antennae, canopies, etc.)
No projections, fins, wings, etc., were noticed by observers.

20. Manoeuvres (turns, climbs, dives, etc. - sketch of flight path.)
Flight path constantly parallel to earth's surface at all points of obser-
vation.

21. Manner of disappearance:
Observer, a doctor, called attention of follow workers; while doing so
lost view of object. Wife, Clara, followed the object's flight until it
completely disappeared from vision. The "disc" moved at an extreme high
rate of speed, and therefore moved from normal eye view, within a matter of
seconds.)

22. Effect on clouds:
Observers stated that no cloud formations were observed on this date.

23. Additional information concerning object:
The "round disc" appeared to move on axis parallel to the earth's surface.

24. Weather conditions and light at time of sighting:
Weather conditions were excellent. No clouds, long range visibility, and
about sixty-five (65) degrees in temperature.

Name and address of observers:
[Redacted]
Hamburg, New York

Occupation and hobbies:
[Redacted] factory worker and farmer
[Redacted] housewife
Their hobbies consist mostly of sports activities.

DETAILS:

1. This investigation was requested by District Commander,,,
1st OSI District.

AT MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE

2. This is a joint investigation of Special Agent ROGER E.
MACDONALD and the writer.

3. On 20 September 1949, at approximately 1000 hours, an
unidentified unconventional aircraft was sighted by WILLIAM B. ARCHIBOLD,
lst Lt., 16020A, while flying a C-47 aircraft (Serial No. 43-49525), based
at Grenier Air Force Base, New Hampshire. Only one unconventional
aircraft was observed; no celestial phenomena or planets were known to
be in the area at that time. Object was sighted in area 20 miles west of
Hooksett, New Hampshire.

4. ARCHIBOLD estimated 10 miles as the point to point distances
from his point of observation to the object. The missile was observed to
be in a 45 to 60 degree dive, at an altitude of 3500 feet (at the time of
initial sighting). ARCHIBOLD was able to observe object for duration of
approximately one second.

5. ARCHIBOLD described the object as being similar in size and
shape to a fighter aircraft fuselage, silver in color, of an undetermined
material. He believes there was no propeller; he observed no identifiable 
markings on the body. A steady orange flame was seen trailing from the 
tail of the object far a distance approximately the same length as the 
body. No smoke or exhaust, other than above-mentioned flame, was visible.

NOTE: Lt. ARCHIBOLD stated that duration of observation was so brief
that a sketch is impossible.

6. The aircraft was observed by ARCHIBOLD to be coming from the
north and heading in a southerly direction. Its flight appeared to be
steady and smooth. The drive path was along a straight line angle with
no evidence of change of course or attitude. ARCHIBOLD observed no lights,
noise and sound and noted no color. He saw no lift or control surfaces 
on the body of the missile. It could not be determined whether the 1/3 
velocity resulted from the propulsion of the trailing flame or from a 
free gravitational fall. ARCHIBOLD hesitated to estimate its speed in

miles per hour, but stated that it exceeded the speed of any jet aircraft he has observed. (This comparison is made to the 650 mile speed of an F-86 type jet aircraft.) The object disappeared from ARCIHOLD's vision as the result of its entering shadows cast on the ground by clouds.

7. WILLIAM S. ARCHBOLD, 1st Lt., 160204, is currently assigned as Adjutant, 82d Air Base Group, Grenier Air Force Base, N.H. ARCHBOLD has been a rated pilot in USAF for over five years and has approximately 1600 hours flying time. Although ARCHIBOLD was recently assigned to this base from the Alaskan Air Command, he is regarded by his fellow workers, and the writer, as being matured, stable, discriminating, intelligent and reliable. Lt. ARCHBOLD had been airborne approximately 55 minutes at the time of the sighting, when his attention was attracted to the missile by the licht that came from thin tail. He stated that he was not fatigued, had rested well the night before, and had done no drinking with in a 36 hour period prior to the sighting.

8. Captain DEANE C. TASKER, AO-796972, the other pilot on the C-47 which ARCHBOLD was flying, did not observe the object because at the time he was engaged in the adjustment of radio controls, and his attention was directed to lower rear section of the pilot's compartment. The flight engineer/T/Sgt THOMAS J. BESTLE, AF-18001139, was in the rear of the aircraft at that time and did not observe the object.

9. The search and early warning radar set of the 64/7th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, was out of commission for repairs during the morning hours 20 September 1949. No radar data is available on unidentified aircraft in Hooksett area on that date.

10. Extensive inquiry has been made among the residents in the area where the object was last observed in an effort to locate other witnesses. To date none have been found, nor has the point of contact, if any, of the object with the earth, been located.

11. Interviews were conducted with representatives of the following airports and flying services in the vicinity of Manchester, New Hampshire: W. S. Martin Flying Service, Concord, New Hampshire; Airport Manager, Concord Municipal Airport, Concord, New Hampshire; Zygdis Flying Service, Suncook, New Hampshire; None of these interviewees had seen or received reports of unconventional aircraft in Concord, Hooksett, Manchester area.

S T A T E M E N T

  II, WILLIAM E. ARGEBLD. 1st Lt. 16020A, Adjutant, 324 Air Base
Group, Grenier Air Force Base, New Hampshire, prior to making the
statement contained in the following paragraphs, have had explained
to me the 24th Article of War by QUINN J. MARSHALL, who has identi-
fied himself to me as a Special Agent of the Office of Special
Investigations, USAF. I understand that I cannot be compelled to
incriminate myself or to answer any question, the answer to which
may tend to incriminate me, or to answer any question not material
to the issue which such answer may tend to degrade me. With such
understanding, I make the following statement of my own free will
and accord, without threat or fear of punishment and without induc-
ement or promise of immunity or reward.

  On 20 September 1949, at approximately 1000 hours, while flying
a C-47 Aircraft (Serial No. 43-15255), at an altitude of 3,500 feet,
I observed an unidentifiable object which appeared to be in a 45 to
60 degree dive. I observed the object for a duration of approximately
one second. It appeared similar in size and shape to a fighter air-
craft fuselage, silver in color, —of an undetermined material.
There was no propellor or other identifiable protrusions on the body.
A steady orange flame was trailing from the tail of the object for a
distance approximately equal to the length of the body. No smoke or
exhaust, other than the above mentioned flame, was visible. The
duration of observation was so brief that a sketch is impossible. Only
one object was observed. It was coming from the north, relative to my
position, on a southerly heading. Its flight appeared to be steady and
smooth. The dive appeared to be on a straight line angle with no evi-
dence of change of course or attitude. I observed no lights, heard no
sound, and detected no odor. I saw no lift or control surfaces on the
body of the missile. I couldn't determine whether its velocity resulted
from the propulsion of the trailing flame or from a free gravitational
fall. It is difficult to estimate its speed in miles per hour, but ap-
peared from my speed of 170 stat.mi/RT I have seen. The object disap-
peared from my vision as the result of its entering shadows cast on the
ground by clouds. This probably occurred because my eyes could not
follow the missile.

  I had been airborne approximately 55 minutes when my attention was
attracted to the missile by the light of the flame issuing from the tail.
I was not fatigued; I had tested satisfactorily and well the night before,
and had done no drinking within a 36 hour period.

UNCLASSIFIED.

Captain DALE C. TASKER, the other pilot, did not observe the
object because at the time, he was engaged in adjusting the radio
controls and his gaze was directed to the lower rear section of the
pilot's compartment. The flight engineer, T/Sgt SMITH, was in the
rear of the aircraft at the time, and did not observe the object.

I have read this statement consisting of two pages and it has
been read to me. I have signed and initialed all preceding pages
and all corrections. This statement is the truth to the best of my
knowledge and belief and I have given it freely and voluntarily.

areas in the United States. By the use of stereoscopic plotting
apparatus, aerial photographs are utilized also in the making of
the regular topographic maps, which show relief as well as
drainage and culture.

A topographic survey of Alaska has been in progress since
1948, and nearly 44 percent of its area has now been mapped.
About 15 percent of the Territory has been covered by maps
on a scale of 1 (1 inch = nearly 8 miles). For most of the
remainder of the area surveyed the maps published are on a
scale of 1 (1 inch = nearly 4 miles). For some areas of particular economic importance, covering about 4,300 square miles,
the maps published are on a scale of 1 (1 inch = nearly 1 mile)
or larger. In addition to the area covered by topographic maps,
about 11,300 square miles of southeastern Alaska has been
covered by planimetric maps on scales of 1 and 1.
The Hawaiian Islands have been surveyed, and the resulting
maps are published on a scale of 1.

DETAILS:

1. This investigation is in accordance with the 
requirements of AFOSI Letter #35, dated 12 August 1949, 
subject: "Unconventional Aircraft, SPECIAL INQUIRY." Report 
was made to Acting District Commander personally by Mrs. 
██████████ and Mrs. ██████████, both of Winchendon, 
Massachusetts on 23 October 1949.

AT WINCHENDON, MASSACHUSETTS

2. This is an investigation by Special Agent HARRY 
J. JENKINS.

3. Above-named agent interviewed Mrs.
██████████ of ████████ Winchendon, Mass-
and Mrs. ██████████ as a result of information volun-
tarily given by ████████, stated that at approxi-
mately 1153, Monday, 26 September 1949, while standing on the 
sidewalk on Central Street, Winchendon, Mass., her attention 
was attracted to some smoke in the sky. On looking up she 
observed an object in the sky which appeared to be diving, 
or falling slowly, emitting puffs of gray smoke in rapid 
succession. No celestial phenomena nor planets, other than 
the sun were discernable. The day was bright with approxi-
mately 3/10 broken clouds. ████████ could not positively 
state the distance of the object from her position vertically, 
but stated that as it lost its very overhead. The object 
remained in sight for approximately fifteen (15) minutes, 
traveling from northwest to southeast and changed course from 
vertical descent gradually to that of horizontal flight. Mo 
sound was noticable, nor were there any effect on the few 
clouds in the sky. The object did not have any wings or 
other appendages. It was described as: "like a 
silver, shiny airplane body, yet more box-like in appearance." 
Object disappeared approximately at a 135 miles distant from 
the observer after a big puff of smoke was emitted.

4. The observer, Mrs. ██████████
Winchendon, Massachusetts, is a housewife and store-clerk,
employed at Howard's Gift Shop, Central St., Winchendon, MASS., 
has flown as a passenger in aircraft occasionally, is interested 
slightly in aviation, and has knowledge of aircraft types, 
including lighter-than-air. Attention was drawn to the object 
during glance at sky and not by any engine smoking trail. 
Observer has average intelligence, is of good character and is 
usually reliable. Observer known to this agent for sixteen 
(16) years.

5. Mrs.
agent, made substantially the same statement but differed
on two (2) points. She stated that the gray smoke was
trailing behind the object in a steady stream and that when
the object disappeared, no large puff of smoke was observed.
It is stated: "When the object reached the horizon, it
seemed to disappear. It just disappeared strangely.
She also stated that the smoke trail remained in the sky
for some time after the object disappeared. The observer
is positive that what she observed was not sky-writing, by
conventional aircraft, as she has witnessed this procedure
before.

6. Mrs.
is a middle-aged housewife, slightly corpulent, Winchendon, Mass.,
types and able to determine unusual appearances of aircraft.
Her attention was drawn to the object by Mrs. 
Observer is of average intelligence, has been known to this
agent for sixteen (16) years and is usually reliable.

7. On 29 October 1949, this agent interrogated Mr.
proprietor of Edward's Gift Shop, Central
St., Winchendon, Mass.
the object, knew it was not an aircraft of the usual types,
but could not recall anything of its appearance. He
positively stated that the object was unusual and definitely
not a conventional aircraft. This observer has knowledge of
aircraft types. His attention was not drawn to the sky by
the reflecting sun as the sky was partly cloudy above 30,000
miles long and is deemed a reputable businessman of usual
reliability.

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significant facts in chronological sequence. Each statement in a large. Brief details of report in AF Form 112—Part II)

The Base Intelligence Officer was notified at approx 15:00 hours, 29 September 1949 that a number of "Unconventional Aircraft" had been sighted six (6) miles west of Enid, Oklahoma. A B-25 type aircraft was immediately dispatched to the area. The A-25 crew was Lt. [REDACTED], Flying Safety Officer and Capt. [REDACTED], Nichols' Base Intelligence Officer. The area was searched carefully with negative results. A large number of seagulls were sighted from altitudes of 1,000 to 4,000 ft. The seagulls were first sighted, because of sun's ray reflecting from their bodies as they wheeled and turned.

During the Interrogation, the observers attention was called to the seagulls flying in the area. She expressed surprise upon learning that the birds flew as high as 4,000 ft. Using her cheap binoculars, the Interrogator found that it could be very easy to mistake the seagulls for "Unconventional Aircraft".

STATEMENT

Vance Air Force Base, Enid, Oklahoma
5 October 1949

On the afternoon of 29 September 1949, at approximately
1445 hours CST, I was tying the gate in our back yard. Our
farm is located 6 miles west of Enid, Oklahoma. I heard a T-6
type airplane droning overhead; I naturally looked up to see
it, but the aircraft had passed from view. A gleam of light
caught my eye and I saw several objects circling overhead.
They would catch the rays of the sun and gleam like the silver
of an aircraft. I didn't know what they were as they were
strange. I ren into the house to get my dime store binoculars.
With the aid of the binoculars, I could see they were going in
a circle and I counted seven (7) objects. They pulled out of
the circle into a straight line very evenly spaced one behind
the other.

The objects traveled at a great rate of speed with a swing-
ing pendulum motion from side to side. They vanished into the
Northwest. The objects would vanish and reappear as the sun's
rays reflected from their bodies.

I immediately called Vance Air Force Base and reported
the sighting to one of the officials of the Base.

I returned to the yard to watch for more of the strange
objects. I saw another group of approximately fifty (50) to
one hundred (100). They came from the Southeast and vanished
to the Northwest. They were round like a record or plate with
a rounded top. I saw no traces of smoke nor could I see pro-
pellers. I heard no sounds such as those made by jet aircraft.
I could make out the round bird-like body with possible short
stubby wings. They seemed to be radio controlled or drawn by 
magnetic force. They were higher than the airplane that writes
Pepsi-Cola signs in the sky. Their speed was twice as fast as
a B-25 airplane.

STATEMENT

Vance Air Force Base, Enid, Oklahoma
5 October 1949

On the afternoon of 29 September 1949, at approximately
1445 hours CST, I was lying the gate in our back yard. Our
farm is located 6 miles west of Enid, Oklahoma. I heard a T-6
type airplane droning overhead; I naturely looked up to see
it, but the aircraft had passed from view. A gleam of light
caught my eye and I saw several objects circling overhead.
They would catch the rays of the sun and gleam like the silver
of an aircraft. I didn't know what they were as they were
strange. I ran into the house to get my dime store binoculars.
With the aid of the binoculars, I could see they were going in 
a circle and I counted seven (7) objects. They pulled out of
the circle into a straight line very evenly spaced one behind
the other.

The objects traveled at a great rate of speed with a swing-
ing pendulum motion from side to side. They vanished into the
Northwest. The objects would vanish and reappear as the sun's
rays reflected from their bodies.

I immediately called Vance Air Force Base and reported
the sighting to one of the officials of the Base.

I returned to the yard to watch for more of the strange
objects. I saw another group of approximately fifty (50) to
one hundred (100). They came from the Southeast and vanished
to the Northwest. They were round like a record or plate with
a rounded top. I saw no traces of smoke nor could I see pro-
pellers. I heard no sounds such as those made by Jet aircraft.
I could make out the round bird-like body with possible short
stubby wings. They seemed to be radio controlled or drawn by
magnetlic force. They were higher than the airplane that writes
Pepsi-Cola signs in the sky. Their speed was twice as fast as
a B-25 airplane.

approximately that of the diameter of the nearby smolo stack; color was
thought to have been silver. During period of observation, estimated to
have been one minute, the objects were thought to have been moving away
from the observer until they faded into the distance. ****** thought
the objects had a thin stream of flame one-half its vertical magnitude,
and one times its horizontal length, extending from its top. No projections
of any sort were noted; no accompanying sounds were heard. Weather was
evaluated as relatively clear with slight haze.

5.  On 2 Oct 1949 the site of the Hamilton Helicopter Assembly Shop,
BOAC Terminal, Baltimore Municipal Airport, was visited, but observance
suggested the Hamilton Company no longer existed in that location. Sub-
sequent inquiry in the area suggested this concern had moved to a downtown
location several months ago; that the nearest helicopter concern, actively
engaged in flying, was in Delaware. No knowledge of the Hamilton Heli-
copter having flown in this area recently was known.

6.  On 3 October 1949 *****, **** Center, 
Camp Holabird, Md, was interviewed and stated in substance:

             Upon leaving the post in his car at about 1525 hours, 30
September 1949, when the JP on duty called his attention to two (2) objects
hovering to the right of the smoke stack of the Chevrolet Assembly Plant,
approximately one thousand (1,000) yards S!' the Main Gate Guard House
on Holabird, Ave. **** described the objects as being about 36 inches in
diameter, circular in shape, which appeared to be directed toward him at
an angle of about 30 degrees from the horizontal; slightly convex and having
concentric circles impressed upon the surface facing him. They appeared
to be made of a vapor or gas of a silvery color, translucent and reflected
light. The source of light (sun) was to the left (south) of the objects.
The objects were not moving and there was no indication of smoke, flame,
or locomotive power. They hung in a stationery manner during the two
minutes period of **** observation. The weather was clear with no
noteable haze or industrial smoke.

7.  On 3 Oct 1949 the records of the Civil Aeronautic Authority
Patrol, Municipal Airport, Baltimore, Md. were examined and the record of
the airport traffic controller (tower-operator) for the period, 0800 to
1600 hours, 30 Sept 1940 read as follows: "....UFR weather entire period.
Operations normal."

3. On 1 October 1949 Corporal -------------------------------------------- ASU,
Camp Holabird, Baltimore 19, Maryland, was interviewed, and stated in
substance:

While on duty as a Military Policeman on the Main Gate, Camp
Holabird, between 1517 and 1519 hours, 30 September 1949, he observed
two (2) unidentifiable aerial objects near the smoke stack of the
Chevrolet Assembly Plant which is adjacent to Camp Holabird. These  
objects appeared to hover between the smoke stack and a large tree,  
a relatively short distance away. --------------------------- described the objects as disc  
shape, much like an enlarged silver dollar, very shiny, but at such  
a distance as to prohibit actual observance of any specific color.  
A comparative measure as to the actual size of the objects was estimated  
as being approximately one half the diameter of the Chevrolet Assembly
Plant's smoke stack. Appropriate angle of elevation during the period  
of observation was estimated as about 15 degrees. The objects seemed to  
be proceeding in no apparent direction, but because of the uncertainity  
concerning the distance of the objects from the observer, it could be difficult  
to estimate any definite speed. -------------------- heard no sound that he would attribute  
to the objects and saw no flame or exhaust. The objects appeared to be  
without fins, canopies, or antenna. ------------------------- conditioner at the time of  
observation were evaluated as relatively clear; no clouds were present,  
although a slight ground haze is thought to be no existed. Position of the  
sun at time of observation was estimated as having 15 degrees in azimuth  
south of the objects, and an undetermined angular distance above. It was  
impossible to establish the manner of disappearance of objects inasmuch  
as the objects left ------------------- field of vision during an interruption caused  
by persons passing through the gate.

object in the vicinity of the smoke stack of the Chevrolet Assembly Plant  
by Corporal ---------------- a guard on duty at the Main Gate. The objects appeared  
disc-like in structure, the center of which was raised much as though a

DETAILS

1. This inquiry was requested by Major NOAL A. LEARY, Air Provost Marshal,
1500th Air Transport Wing, Hickam Air Force Base, and is based upon report by:

1st Lt FREDERICK J. NOWMAN, AO779992, 31st Weather Squadron
last Lt CLARENCE R. MARTIN, 156294, Hg Pacific Division, MATS

Hickam Air Force Base, to another Federal Agency, that they had observed an un-
identified flying object at about 1700 hours, Hawaiian Time, 30 September 1949.

AT HICKAM AIR FORCE BASE, HONOLULU, T.H. AND VICINITY

2. On 30 September 1949, NORMAN and MARTIN were interviewed, and the follow-
ing Joint statement made by them:

ST A T E M E N T

We, 1st Lt FREDERICK J. NOWMAN, AO779992, 31st Weather Squadron, APO 953,
and 1st Lt CLARENCE R. MARTIN, 156294, Hq & Hq Squadron, PACD, TAPS, APO 953,
prior to making this statement will say the following paragraphs have had
placed into us the 24th Article of War by an individual who has identified himself
to us as a Special Agent of the Office of Special Investigations, USAF. We under-
stand that we cannot be compelled to incriminate ourselves or to answer any ques-
tion not material to the issue we an the answer may tend to degrade us. We have
been informed of our rights to have an attorney.

This is a report of an unidentified Flying object which was observed by us
under the following. circumstances.

At approximately 1700 hours this date, Friday, 30 September, 1949, we were
approximately 100 feet off shore at Yeeh Beach, Honolulu International Airport
where we had gone swimming, and were laying on a cement raft, our faces to the
sky. Our attention was attracted by a small, brilliant object in the sky, over-
head, approximately 5-degress from zen in the direction of Hickam Air Force
Base. This was a single object and because of its dazzling appearance, we first
thought it to be a star, until we realized that the sun had not yet gone down.
This object was very small in perspective, about the size of a quarter held at a
thumbtack held at a distance of about 3 feet. It appeared to us to be well over
10,000 feet in height. This object appeared white in color, as if coated with
aluminum paint or was of aluminum construction. It first appeared to be round,
but, on occasion, changed to an elliptical shape, and back to round again. We
could not hazard a guess as to approximate size. This object seemed to float in
the sky and travelled in a generally northerly arc from what appeared to us to
be from above over Hickam to Tripler Hospital and thence to Honolulu. It was ob-
served for a period of at least 20 minutes. This object made no vertical ascent
or descant that we could observe; however, did from time to time, move short dis-
tances to and from on a horizontal plane. From time to time the object would
appear to spin rapidly in an evasive, erratic manner. At time what appeared evi-
dence of eminant in the form of a grey-brown, light colored smoke was noted.

This smoke was about 4 times as wide as the object and about 4 times as long.
Than this object appeared to be spinning, this smoke seemed to spiral around
the object, evaporating or dissipating quickly. The odd scent detection
was said to have dissipated at the same clear in The nun was in the general
direction of southwest behind us. No clouds were observed in the immediate vicinity
of the object. No other object appeared in the vicinity of the object. The object
appeared to be supported by aerostatic lift; no propeller, jet or aerodyname vanes
were noted. The object faded from view, disappearing behind the rising smoke of a
dump fire in the vicinity of Honolulu. We do not believe this object touched the
ground. If photographic equipment were available, it is not believed it would
have been possible to photograph the object as it was so small and so high in the
sky. A sketch of the object, many times enlarged, is attached to this statement.

We have read this statement consisting of two pages, and it has been read
to us. We have signed and initialed all preceding pages and corrections. This
statement is the truth to the best of our knowledge and belief, and we have given
it freely and voluntarily.

5. On 30 September 1949, the Aircraft Control Center, Civil Aeronautics
Administration, Department of Commerce, Honolulu International Airport (formerly
known as John Rodgers Airport) reported to my headquarter one of our aircraft was
except one (1) plane which was engaged in a radio range controlled landing at about
1712 hours, Hawaiian time. This aircraft was described as being well under 6,000
feet and approaching the airport from the sea, or from the general direction of
south, the unknown expressed both that this aircraft could not have seen the un-
identified flying object reported due to its direction, speed of flight and altitude.
No report of unidentified flying object was reported to the Civil Aeronautics Ad-
ministration. The Aircraft Control Center further advised that the following NOTAM
was published by the GAA at 1630 hours, Hawaiian time, 30 September 1949.

HONOLULU AIRPORT., BALLOON WITH RADIOSONDS ATTACHED WILL BE RELEASED FROM

HONOLULU AIRPORT AT 1635Z. EXPECTED TO REACH 10000 FEET AT 1545H

6. Mr. ROBERT L. WOLFF, Meteorological Aide, US Weather Bureau, Honolulu
Airport Station, reported, 30 September 1949, that a radiosonde balloon had
been released by that facility at 1636 hours, Hawaiian time, 30 September 1949
(0236Z 1 October 49) and was in flight for forty-eight (48) minutes until the
tarninium was burst of balloon. WOLFF reported that the balloon involved was a
natural filled, white color, pure gum rubber sphere which was inflated to a dia-
meter of 7 feet. Suspended 50 feet from the balloon was a radiosonde transmitter
in a box approximately 4" x 10" x 10". Attached to the radiosonde transmitter
was an aerial three (3) feet in length. Mcuay between the transmitter and
balloon was a paper parachute, three (3) feet in diameter, so contrived that
when the balloon burst, the parachute persisted on the transmitter to glide, rather
than plummet, to the earth. The balloon and its entire data was white in color,
so selected because of the clear day and the color compliments the sunlight, en-
abling its dight to be followed with ease through an optical instrument, TEM
as the theodolite. The (3) color of balloons are employed by the Local Weather
Bureau according to WOLFF, white for use on bright clear sky days low use on
in case they and black for use on a cloudy day. The rate of ascent of balloon if dependant
winds; however, the average rate is roughly 1000 feet per minute. As the balloon rises,
it expands and in atmospheric pressure, reaching dilation of 12 to 18 feet, accord-
ing to WOLFF. WOLFF further advises that if atmospheric conditions are favorable,
it is possible to pick out and follow a balloon at a height of 45,000 feet. After
consulting a Winds Aloft Computation Sheet prepared from the flight of this balloon,
Mr. WOLFF expressed the opinion that the unidentified flying object observed could
well have been the balloon released by the Weather Bureau, as this balloon was in
flight during the time and followed the path described. Mr. WOLFF further advised
that the balloon was tracked by Mr. W.A. TRUEBLOOD, Meteorological Aide, US
Weather Bureau, Honolulu Airport Station.

Mr. WOLFF for the local times indicated on 30 September 1949

9. The Honolulu Police Department advised on 1 October 1949, that during the
afternoon and early evening hours of 30 September 1949, no report had been received
by them of any unidentified flying object.

10. 1st Lt NORMAN H. STEVENS, AO 821899 and Cpl JAMES R. OLSON, AF 131 176 125,
Operations Officer and Operations Clark, respectively, 1500th Air Base Group, Hickam
Air Force Base, advised, on 2 October 1949, that there was little flying craft
activity in the vicinity of Hickam Air Force Base at about 1700 hours. Flights during
the day usually land at about 1650 hours while at about 1750 hours pilots not being
before 1300 hours. Banshee jets of the 199th Escort Squadron (ANG), which normally
bounce from Barbers Sands, Hawaii, T. H., which landed at 1714 hours. An R4D (C-47)
assigned to VJ1 Squadron 352 (USNDb) (Unreadable) from Barbers Point, Oahu, landed at
1725 hours. Two F-47 Aircraft of the Hawaiian National Guard landed at 1658 hours.
No traffic were reported. All aircraft described as above believed to have been well
under 6,000 feet while in flight and were readily identifiable as such.

11. Lt. William A. TENQUOOD, Meterological Aide, US Weather Bureau, Honolulu
Airport Station reported: on 2 October 1949, that he released a white colored radio-
sonde balloon at 1636 hours, local time, 30 September 1949, and that it followed the
flight of this balloon by means of a theodolite. According to TENQUOOD, this balloon
traveled in the general northerly and described by lts WOLFF and MARTIN at about
the times reported. TENQUOOD curve recoil of Mr. WOLF was as to general description
of the balloon; that these balloons expand while rising, and that they can be
observed with the naked eye up to 45,000 feet, if followed closely and atmospheric
conditions are favorable. It was TENQUOOD's opinion that atmospheric conditions
were favorable during the afternoon of 30 September. TENQUOOD also reported that
the balloons used by the local Weather Station are in three (3) colors - white, for
use on clear days, black for use on cloudy days, yellow for use in haze - and that
the white balloon had been selected on 30 September because of its properties in
reflecting sunlight. TENQUOOD advised that while "tracking" this balloon, he
observed it to shift to and fro due to wind action, but did not observe it to spin,
nor did he observe any contradiction which would account for any sort of axis or
haust. TENQUOOD did offer the observation that perhaps eye strain and optical-
illusion could account for such report, recalling that parlor game of gazing steadily
at a spot, shifting the eyes and the spot retained would seem to move.

12. Major GEORGE H. ARMSTRONG, JR, 752A1, Commanding Officer, 64th Aircraft 
Control and Warning Squadron, APO 953, advised on 4 October 1949, that the only
radar station operating at about 1700 hours, 30 September 1949, on the island of 
Oahu, was the radar station at Kaaikul, located on the opposite side of the island.
