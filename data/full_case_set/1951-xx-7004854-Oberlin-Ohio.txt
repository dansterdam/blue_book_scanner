Dear Lt. Col. Friend,

A Air Force friend of mine was telling me about your UFO investigation center here, and I thought I would ask you about a sighting of a strange floating object I seen a few years ago. It was back in 1951 at my father's farm where I was residing. Now, I was taking a wait down are dirt road - when I got to the second car (about a thousand foot from the house) I noticed over a neighbor's wood, a large ...

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter dated March 3, 1954, addressed to "Dr. [REDACTED]" from Major Maston H. Jacks of the Office of Information, Public Information Division, USAF. The letter discusses an unidentified object sighting reported by the recipient and explains that the Air Force is unable to make any evaluation or identification concerning the object, as the available data is insufficient. The letter states that the object was well observed and the details provided are clear, but no definitive answer can be given on the query. It also mentions that there has never been any evidence or indication that the unidentified flying objects present a threat to the security of the United States or any extraterrestrial vehicles under intelligent control.

March 3, 1954

Dear Dr. [REDACTED],

This is in response to your recent inquiry for an evaluation of an unidentified object sighting you witnessed in 1951.

The Air Force is unable to make any evaluation or your observation through your description contained essential data and was quite clear and explicit. 

Attached is the latest Air Force Fact Sheet on the Augmentation of the investigation of flying objects. It is believed to contain much of the information on a sighting even though sufficient details are given, and this case remains listed in the "unidentified" category.

It is regretted that we are unable to give you a definite answer on your query. It may be of interest that in over 3,000 sightings during the past 15 years, there has never been any evidence or indication that the unidentified flying objects present a threat to the security of the United States or an extraterrestrial vehicle under intelligent control.

Sincerely,

MASTON H. JACKS
Major, USAF
