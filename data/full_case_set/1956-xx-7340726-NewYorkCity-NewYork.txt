To the Air Technical Investigation Command.
Sirs-
This communication is from a citizen of New York City- at the above address for definite reasons/years. Should I believe for all officials to whom it is assured this - and to assure you now of my absolute truthfulness - and attention to detail - in regard to the following : -
Returning as usual, from St. Vincent's Hospital (West 12th St. and 7th Ave. NYC) the other night, about 9:30 PM, a strange and unnatural scene came into my vision, at the intersection of five roads - which I have to cross - there is a fairly large garden (corner of Perry Street and 7th Ave. Attached to the carrace is a small space (wired in) where three or four cars sometimes park. Bordering on this space are two large white quiet large bungalow-like structures, but the one I concentrated on as I was hurrying to my home, when to my utter astonishment I saw a dark shaped object of small dimensions- apparently heading directly into the wall of one of the apt houses. There was no sound at all as this dark shaped object (could not name it) moved with what appeared a deliberate speed and 1/4 the distance of a city block. There was no reflection of any kind on the wall (villa area). It could not therefore refer to any other person. At the fall of the cone was what appeared to be fins. The night was very dark, and the stars and moon were obscured by light from the dim street lights of the village area. The cone or object of the same was a soft grey. The light form (along the tail) was almost black background. From the pointed light at the tip of the cone, was a brilliant steady light- "as though one of the stars had come closer." This steady light kept gradually dying out, and then shining again, without flicker. This apparition suddenly disappeared without sound and at the moment when I should have observed the wall, I saw a bright light shoot out then disappeared. The whole incident was so swift, that it could hardly be considered more than a few seconds in duration. Personally I refuse to ridicule.I said very little about it, except to a few close friends. Even so I write you now my statement as other followers of these subjects should do, and this detailed sketch is for whatever it may be worth. I am personally afraid of things of this kind and know absolutely nothing about technicalities or scientific matters. This was not, therefore, anything I might have seen in some book dealing with these subjects. I am two years late in sending this information, and am puzzled on not do so earlier. There is no explanation, though the other does not, as I feel about it. 
Believe me sirs,
most faithfully.
(Miss)
