PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 23 September 52 23/1035Z
3. SOURCE: Civilian
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 2 Objects
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 Seconds
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: South
9. PHOTOS: No
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
1 luminescent object pale gold. One sighting at 2:35, one at 4:07 AM. Sound like soft breeze. Second object was quite far away. Objects came directly overhead. 11-15 objects in formation at 1st sighting. Flight North to South. Flight straight line.
Witness 62 year old lady. Reported the objects to GCA. Letter to USAF in 1955. No investigation. Sighting too old.
Observation is characteristic of a flight of birds at night reflecting light from the ground. Duration, formation sound and areas of are through which the objects passed all consistent with this analysis. Also directions to South tends to add to theory of migratory birds such as ducks or geese being in formation.
10. CONCLUSION: BIRDS

The image provided appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The page contains a photograph that depicts three different UFO-like objects in the sky. The objects are shown as silhouettes against a landscape. However, since the image does not contain any human faces, I will not identify or name any individuals in the response.

Regarding the text in the document, the OCR output is as follows:

FLYING SAUCERS FROM OUTER SPACE

The document appears to be discussing or providing information about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or "flying saucers" from outer space.

Gentlemen: I am not satisfied that your office is the proper place to send this report, but that is where my office has addressed it.

I got a copy back in writing in 1953 that said F. Kayhoe in 1953, and I also got some addressed from a friend not long ago when I finished reading this book, saying I picked up the other affair, the basic fact of the book from my notes.

Mrs Bint/man/SAPOFC/72842/2 Sep 65
SEP - 7 1955
This is in reply to your report of an aerial object which you claimed you observed.
Since this matter is still under investigation, it is not possible for us to compare your report with other reports from the California area during that period.
The books by Donald Keyhoe are considered to be science fiction by the Air Force UFO project. I hope this information will be of interest to you.
Sincerely,
JOHN E. BAILLIEUL

The image appears to be a black-and-white photograph showing what looks like an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky over Corona del Mar, California. The object is obscured and partially redacted, but it appears to have an elongated, cigar-like shape. The text below the image identifies the location as "Corona del Mar, California 92625".

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is a letter that refers to a report of an unidentified flying object observed in 1952 in the California area.

The text in the document reads as follows:

UFO SIGHTING, 23 SEP 52, CALIFORNIA
25 AUG 1965
RE USAF ANALYSIS (PBB REPORT)
NARD D C 20330
This office is in receipt of a letter from Mr.   requesting an identification of a flying object which he observed on 23 Sep 52.
Dear Mrs. :
Your observation of an unidentified object in 1952 is too old to be investigated by the Air Force. There were NO reports from the California area for 23 Sep 52.
Some additional information on objects seen in the area of Santa Ana, California, was received in this office and given to the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on 11 Oct 52. This information was considered to be a known or conventional object.
The details of your report and any further information are considered evaluated by Donald E Keyhoe and are considered included in this report. 
The Air Force appreciates your interest in this matter.
