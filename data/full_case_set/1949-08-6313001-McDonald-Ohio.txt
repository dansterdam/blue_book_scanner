interviewed. Mr. ------------- stated that after notifying the U.S. Air Force, he
found out what the aerial phenomena was, for the following day he put an
article in the paper which is more or less self-explanatory. When asked
if he actually thought the incident was attributed to "flying saucers", he
stated that he was doubtful but that it was a good thing to write an
article on. A copy of the article is attached to this report.

McDonald: 'Sau~' Turn Out
To Be Bits of 'Silver Paper

The latest rumors of "flying
saucers"—this time in our own
backyard—have been quelled.
Thursday several McDonald Cit-
izens were startled to behold high
in the sky, several shiny objects
which seemed to be going up. It
was difficult to make out size or
shape of the "things".

According to Tom Luarde, 14, of
Marshall Rd. who was probably
the first resident to view the spec-
tacle, he noticed a shiny mass of
something moving through the air
and ran to the Goodwill Club
where he spread the news.
Tom said that soon after he saw
the object, splitting up and flopping
in the sun, it split into four or
five pieces, and all headed for the
glinting. They disappeared from
sight and a few minutes later be-
gan to fall towards the earth.

Several persons, including Frank
Roseman of Margaret Ave., saw
the shiny "saucers" but had no
idea as to what they were or even
the shape of them.

As the McDon~ residents
watched, one "saucer" looked as
though it might land a few miles
away and several boys took off on
their bicycles to investigate.

The secret of the "saucers"
wasn't known until yesterday after-
noon and after special investiga-
tion of the site some men
called in an Air Force had been
to come here today to look into
the matter.

It was found that employees of
the Carnegie-Illinois plant had
cleaned out an old building. They
were burning trash, some of which
was a kind of silver paper. One of
the pieces of paper took a jaunt
into the stratosphere—hence, "fly-
ing saucers" or a reasonable fac-
simile.
