10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
A very bright light, much brighter than the surrounding stars, 
was seen low in the southeastern sky. The light was reddish 
in color. The light appeared to be at a standstill for a few 
seconds, and then suddenly disappeared.
11. COMMENTS
The planet Jupiter was visible at the time of the observation, and was close to the position where the light was seen. The movement and sudden disappearance of the light was probably due to atmospheric conditions.

GENERAL APPEARANCE: was the same as a star. No outlining was visible and it seemed to be at such a brightness that it might be a star. However, the light never varied in size or brilliance unlike stars. The light, however, was steady and about the size of stars near it and appeared to be red in color.

OTHER DETAILS: On one occasion the object was spotted for approximately 4 to 5 seconds. It then disappeared from view as though it had turned off or flew away. On another occasion it was observed for around 10 to 15 minutes. During this sighting no sound was heard, however due to the great altitude, I doubt we could have heard any sound even if there had been any.

THE NIGHT WAS A CLEAR AND BRIGHT ONE; my daughter and I both enjoyed excellent visibility. NEITHER THE DAUGHTER NOR I COULD DETECT ANY MOTION OR CHANGE IN POSITION OF THE OBJECT DURING THE OBSERVATION. It appeared to be stationary, but its location was slightly changed when next observed.

I would appreciate this statement being kept confidential and trust your discretion in this matter. I have held a responsible position in local civil defense for the past ten years as controller and business manager and consider myself to be a thoroughly reliable person.

LOCATION - Keystone Point; North Miami, Florida.

SWORN TO AND SUBSCRIBED TO BEFORE ME A NOTARY PUBLIC, STATE OF FLORIDA, AT LARGE, ON THIS 15TH DAY OF JUNE, 1970.

Transcribing the text from the document:

"AFFIDAVIT

Commander, 2556th Airborne, Sq.mn. 
Eglin AFB, Fla.
field international Airport
Miami, Florida

Attention: Captain D.R. Boggs

This is to certify that on the evening of May 25, 1960 at 10:35 P.M., E.S.T., I was returning for the night flight to determine 15 day work flying hours under night conditions.

In the course of my casual observation, my attention was drawn to a brilliant light, that the light suddenly moved toward the north. I immediately determined that this was no normal aircraft. It moved at high speed and seemed to gain altitude rapidly, then it suddenly reversed its course and moved back in the general direction from which it came, a distance of approximately one-half mile. It then appeared to drop back to its original position, although it did not return to its exact former position as it was observed to be slightly higher. 

The light or object was observed to have an intensity of approximately twice the normal intensity of any star in its vicinity at that time. Its motion was erratic, and not in the normal flight pattern of any known aircraft. When it moved in its southerly direction, it became a definite phosphorescent green in color. When it reversed its course and moved northward, it appeared to be a brilliant white light. The maneuver was repeated several times. Although it did not return to its exact former position, it was continually observed for a period of over twenty-three (23) seconds.

A period of one hour and ten minutes elapsed before the light or object ceased to be observed in the sky, although it did not return to its exact former position as it was observed to be slightly higher. The maneuver was repeated several times."

Other descriptions to the witness could be included, as written and to the conclusion. 

Could be that a check of the weather might also show the conditions at the time assuming the conditions were significant to the observation. Many lines as good.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: North Miami, Florida
Date: 27 May 1960
Time (Z): 2235
Wx: Clear and bright
Description: A very bright light, much brighter than the surrounding stars, was seen to appear to move up and down a few inches, was changing colors of greenish silver & reddish-orange x yellow (depending on observer). The light appeared to be at a very high altitude, but between the stars and observer.
Direction of Motion: Varied
Satellite: (ARGON-JP3) phon# 69219) Ruled out
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): Probably Jupiter
Radar Analysis (ARGIN-4E1): None
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): ------
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Ruled out
Other: 
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Prob reliable
Analysis and Conclusions: The location of the witnesses was apparently at Keystone Point, therefore the object must have been ESE of their location. In that part of the sky at that time, there were fixed stars apparently present which could reasonably appear to move slightly and change color. The movement reported was probably due to atmospheric conditions.

FIRST REPORT.
SUMMARY (Give a brief written narrative) : UFO sighting reported to the 0D at 1941EST 25 May 60.

Reportee stated that she (?) was looking out a window when she noticed something in the sky that she had never seen before. She further stated that she had some physical reactions like she had never seen before.

Since it took me approximately one hour to arrive at the above address,I called Central C.O. Lowry AFB, Colo. APPARENTLY the sighting was of short duration and the object could no longer be seen when I arrived. She stated the object arrived at the address at 0012EST and the object could no longer be seen some time later.

Location of sighting was SE of Keystone Point (North Miami Beach) ,Florida and appeared larger than a star and had a bright white glow. It remained in a stationary position and was in sight for several minutes. No trail, exhaust, or unusual features were observed.

First observed while out in the yard about 1930EST. Appeared to move up and southerly direction and after moving up would appear to deep back some and then continue again.

Witnesses to the sighting were the reportee and a resident at the same address and mother of reportee.

"AFFADAVIT"

To Whom It May Concern:

The following is an account of my personal observations of an unknown object, which was first sighted by me on June 17, 1956, at approximately 8:00 p.m. in the vicinity of North Miami, Florida.

After watching it for about ten (10) to 15 minutes, my mother called it to my attention, and I continued to observe the object from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

The object continued observation; it's shape resembled a cigar or missile, and its color appeared to be reddish in appearance and continuing visibility for over an hour. (2) Its altitude was approximately 2000 feet and possibly higher at certain intervals (20) seconds, for over a period of one half hour to one hour.

It was that in spite of its repeated efforts to do so, it seemed to lack sufficient speed or manueverability to enable it to vanish from sight as on previous occasions. I gained the impression that the object was utilizing a 'hovering' type of control.

My observations led me to the conclusion, that the brilliant light which was a part of the object, which was not visible at such a distance, was the exhaust flame of what appeared to be a missile or jet plane in flight. This was observed immediately prior to the actual disappearance of the object in the vicinity which Captain Porosky, (the Air Force Officer who investigated the incident) also verified.

The object began the man-hover's each time, by moving in a southeasterly direction which was estimated to be 10 to 15 degrees or possibly more, and then returning to the original point of reference. Its ability to hold its position and manuever in this manner, I considered to be an amazing display of controlled flight. I believe this to be unparalleled as to the accuracy and speed of its movements.

I was impressed by the metallic silver cast, glimmering appearance of the object, as seen through field glasses, and the complete silence of its movements. The movements also seemed to be without any visible means of propulsion, as the object appeared to defy the laws of physics and gravity in its performance.

It is my earnest wish that my observations, which I have respectfully but accurately reported, will be of some small value to those who strive to advance such chararcteristics of scientific achievement.

AFFIDAVIT

This is to certify that the following statement is a true account of my personal observations regarding the evening of May 25, 1960. North Miami, Florida:

My neighbor called me over to her front yard to observe an unusual object, located over a house approximately a mile away.

After watching said object for several minutes, my observation was that it suddenly appeared to change position and it seemed to halt and hold its position for about 20 seconds. Then it appeared to take off at a tremendous rate of speed, disappearing from my point of view. The approximate size of the object was estimated to be about 12 inches (15 inches). As it seemed to return to its original position, I endeavored to acquire any height, shape, or sound that would enable me to further identify the object, but was unable to either see or hear anything at all.

I am firmly convinced that it could not have been a plane, as it's movements within the rifteen or so seconds seem to be an impossibility for any known aircraft. It seemed to me, and the stars.

Sworn to and subscribed to before me a Notary Public, this 1st day of July, 1960; at North Miami, Florida.

My license expires April 17, 1961.
