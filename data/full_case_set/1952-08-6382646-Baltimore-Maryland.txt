AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: (AGENCY) G-2, 2D Sq. ADM.
TO: COMMANDING GENERAL
SUBJECT: Unidentified aerial objects observed over Baltimore, Maryland on 6 August 1952
1. On 6 August 1952 a private and licensed flying club pilot observed 11 bright lights in a formation at about 8,000 feet above the grounds of the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. The objects were shiny silver in color and were traveling at approximately 500 mph. The formation broke up and the individual objects accelerated to an estimated speed of 2,000 mph and disappeared from view. 
2. The pilot who made this observation is a very experienced and reliable flyer. He has been flying light aircraft for over 10 years and has over 2,000 flying hours to his credit. He is considered to be a competent and trustworthy observer. 
3. Comparable visual observations were made by other witnesses in the area at the time. All descriptions were generally consistent.
4. Data obtained from the radar station at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport corroborated the visual sightings. Targets appeared on the radar screen at the time and location of the visual observations. The targets were tracked for a distance of 30 miles before fading from the radar.
5. This situation has no satisfactory conventional explanation. The performance characteristics of the objects observed, including the high rate of acceleration, were beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft.
6. Tentative conclusions: 
1) The observed objects were real and of unknown origin.
2) They possessed performance capabilities beyond the scope of present-day aircraft.

1st Observation:
Date: August 23 - Time: 2205 - 2235
Observers Location: 2300 Windsor Ave. Section of city, west Baltimore, Md.

Object was first observed at 2207hrs as a bright flash of light appeared on the eastern horizon, moving in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed. Object was observed for approximately (20) seconds as it moved across the sky, at a speed estimated to be in excess of 1,000 mph. It diminished in size and intensity, as if going into a climb, and was obscurred [sic] from view by scattered high clouds. Three individuals observed this object.

(2) miles from earth & south - and return. Altitude was approximately 20,000 ft. as estimated by the observers. The object was observed without the aid of any optical instruments and the whole observation was approximately 20 seconds in duration.

Due to the high speed, high altitude and unusual maneuvers, the object was observed by (3) adults.

2nd Observation:
Initiated to 1st observation, except for the following: Object was first observed by civilian residents, from 2300 Windsor Ave. at 21:07hrs, Developed in to [sic] object. Due to the location of 2300 Windsor Ave. and the apparent size and movement of the object, it apparently covered a distance of approx. 3 miles in 10 minutes, at a steady, moving at first very slowly drawing speed. Observed for approximately 10 minutes.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
COUNTRY: 
AREA: BALTIMORE, MARYLAND   BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
DATE OF INFORMATION: 14 JULY 52 
DATE OF REPORT: 6 AUGUST 1952
SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
SOURCE:
EVALUATION: 3
SUMMARY: (Based on information in received from the source, as interpreted by evaluating officer. Include date, time, location, description of objects, actions taken, and other pertinent details.)

On 14 JULY 52, at approximately 10.48P.M., a married couple living at the above address observed three to four spherical or disc-shaped objects travelling at a high rate of speed across the sky. The objects were white in color and appeared to be reflecting some light. They were seen for a period of about 2 minutes. The objects were about 15 degrees apart in the night sky and were travelling at an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet. A fourth object was tentatively observed but could not be positively identified.

The objects were reported to the Baltimore Air Defense Filter Center, 11th Air Division, and were confirmed by radar. No interceptors were scrambled as the objects were outside the Baltimore air defense sector.
