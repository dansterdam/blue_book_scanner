Dear Mr. [Redacted],

On 7 January 1960, the United States Air Force received a report of an observation of unidentified flying objects over your area on 4 January 1960.

On 4 January 1960, at 0330, Mars was high in the sky to the northeast. An object was seen to the northeast of Morton. It appeared to be of a brilliant, shiny silver color and very bright. It moved at a terrific rate of speed and appeared to hover at times. The duration of the observation was approximately 15 to 20 minutes.

The above information is forwarded to you for your information, and your comprehensive reports concerning flying objects and your comprehensive reports are solicited.

Sincerely,

MAJOR QUINTANILLA, JR
CHIEF, PROJECT BLUE BOOK
