AFCIN-4Bla/V. D. Bryant/jc
72131/Bldg 263/P D41

1. All three "targets" i.e., all three "sightings" appear similar in nature.
The very short time observed, and lack of any other confirming data prevent any positive analysis. The fact that the speeds reported were extremely high is an indication that the blips were widely spread out on the scope, and may very well have been separate "blips" not due to the same "target."

2. The "interference" from the other radar (which was recognized as such) would have appeared as "rabbit tracks" on the scope - being a number of dots, or tracks, usually curved or spiralling. These were not the targets referred to in the reports.

3. It is the opinion (which cannot be proven) that the targets observed were not "real" targets, but were examples of the myriads of unexplained paintings on a radar scope.

SUMMARY (Give summary which highlights the salient factors of narrative report. Being narrative test on AF Form 112 Changes may be lightly added for AF forman 121 Last sentences including reason for Summary page)
1. On 14 Nov 57, radar surveillance sightings with ground 
electronic equipment (AN/MPS-11) at the Gungeo's radar station 
(51 degrees 25 minutes, 03 seconds North; 09 degrees, 31 minutes,
55 seconds East) of the 601st ACWRON, Rothwesten, Germany, revealed
three targets of unknown character.
2. All three targets were high speed in nature. The first 
target was initially detected at 1101Z at MG 2315 (22 nautical 
miles southwest of Hersenberg Sovozone Airfield). The second target 
was detected at 1144Z at MG 5015 (8 nautical miles southwest of 
Hersenberg Sovozone Airfield). The third target was detected at 
1755Z at NE 1055 (within West Germany, approximately 10 nautical 
miles southeast of the West German-Czech border).
3. There was no evidence of abnormal electronic interference 
with respect to the target detected at 1101Z. However, an unusual 
amount of interference occurred at the time of the other two 
sightings. Investigations by reliable radar maintenance and intelli-
gence personnel brought forth satisfactory explanations for all 
interference other than the targets being reported.

Germany

In accordance with the provisions of AFR No. 200-2, 12 Aug 54, the following pertains to a sighting on 14 Nov 57.
(1) Description of objects:
(a) Radar blip
(b) N/A
(c) N/A
(d) Blip eventually split into two
(e) Parallel course at separation
(f) High speed from 2,000 to 3,000 nautical mph
(g) H/A
(h) N/A
(i) N/A

(2) Description of course of objects:

(b) Determination of elevation not possible. However, blip was first sighted 100 degrees at 70 nautical miles (MG 2315)
(c) Determination of elevation not possible. Sea 8 below. For place where blip departed limits of plotting board.
(a) Flight path to North MG 2315, MG 2257; here track divided into two sections. One section proceeded to MG 4020, MG 4045, MG 4020, MG 2550 where it left bounds of plotting board. Second section proceeded to MG 4245, MG 4645, MG 4121, MG 3050 where it left bounds of plotting board. (f) Blip was painting clearly when it left bounds of plotting board.
(d) Time minutes (1101Z - 1106Z)

(3) Manner of observations:
(a) Ground-electronic (AN/MPS-11)(AN/MPS-14)
(b) N/A
(c) N/A

(4) Time and date of sighting:
(a) 1101 - 11063, 14 November 57
(b) Day

(5) Location of observer: 51 degrees 25 minutes 03 seconds N, 09 degrees 31 minutes 35 seconds E (this is the location of Gurneyest Radar Station of the 501st ACWRON, Rothwesten, Germany) (6) Identifying information of all observers: (a) N/A (b) Charles L. Flook, S/Sgt, USAF; good reliability

(7) Weather and winds aloft conditions at time and place of sighting: Negative due to location of target.
(8) Impossible due to speed and position of blip.

(10) Jupiter 134 (DC-4) travelling 192 knots @ 7,000 ft(this was carried as track 697)

(11) End of report based primarily on the observations of Sgts Flook. Portions of the flight path were also observed a Captain, a Warrant Officer, and another S/Sgt; they are agreeing as to the high speed nature of aircraft. Flook was the only one to observe the entire flight path. None of these personnel have any reasons for or the cause of the sightings.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:

    The radar maintenance officer explained the unusual interfer-
ence cited in Lt. Rumstein's observations as being caused by the 
excessive rotation rate and PRF relationships between Gunpost's
AN/MPS-11 and our Native Son radar station's AN/GPS-4. The latter
is located 58 line of sight miles at 50 degrees 29 minutes 54
seconds North and 09 degrees 57 minutes 17 seconds East. Other-
wise there does not seem to be answer for the phenomena in the 
targets being reported.
