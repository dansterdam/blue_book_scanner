The image appears to contain a photograph depicting a military operation in the backyard of a residential home. The photograph shows several soldiers digging into the ground, presumably investigating a "mysterious object" that may have been buried there. The text below the image describes the details of this operation, including that "Army explosives specialists dug down into the back yard at a San Gabriel home, searching for a possible missile".

Text extracted from the document:

DIG FOR SOLUTION - Army Ordinance experts dig in back yard of San Gabriel home in search of mysterious object that may have rocketed out of sky and plunged into earth there. They planned to dig to depth of 20 feet if it is necessary.

Explosive Experts Dig for Mysterious Object

Army Specialists Excavate in Back Yard of San Gabriel Home for Possible Missile

Army explosives specialists dug down into the back yard at a San Gabriel home yesterday in search of a possible missile. 
Capt. Earle A. M. Jones, who directed the operations, said the army believed an object may have fallen to earth there. The home's owner, Travis S. Gomer said he did not see any object fall but heard a loud thump in his back yard several days ago. 
Capt. Joseph Jackson, commander of the 6th Army Ordnance Explosive Disposal Unit, directed the digging operations.
The Temple City sheriff's department assisted in the search.
Sgt. Charles Melvin said the digging would continue today if it was necessary to go to a depth of 20 feet.

It appears to be a scanned page from a document that describes an incident where the Army deployed personnel to investigate a "Mystery Object" that was spotted from the air. The text provides details about the incident, including the time, location (Temple, California), and actions taken by the Army personnel.

Army Digs for Mystery Object
Continued from first page.
His men dug cautiously at the spot for about half an hour. They
uncovered nothng and then decided to place several sticks of
explosive ordnance disposal tape around the hole and go away
for the night. At about 5 a.m. he returned to the vicinity,
due to fear down in the rocky ground, and without finding any
sign of a missile or explosive, set a guard during the night.
Lt. Col. STURDEY, a veteran, said they saw the object stopping
up and down in the air about 700 feet high for about two and
a half minutes shortly before 5 p.m. He ordered his men to dig,
but they uncovered nothing. He said the hole could have been
caused by a meteor, but that there was no sign of a missile or
bomb, as the base had initially feared. He said if the object
had been a missile or bomb, his men would have found some
fragments. He said there was an Air Force sighted report about
the time the UFO was seen, but the Air Force said it was not
missiles or aircraft.

CONTENT OF THE TEXT:

WITNESS: ESTIMATE AS SMALL AS 30 SECONDS, AS LARGE AS 2 MINUTES DURATION. IT WAS SHAPED LIKE A FLUORESCENT LIGHT BULB, AND SEEMED TO BOUNCE OR OSCILLATE AND MOVED RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SKY. IT WAS VERY BRIGHT AND SEEMED TO GO OUT AND COME ON AGAIN, LANDING WITH CARE.
HE ADMITTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING OTHER THAN A FLYING OBJECT, SUCH AS A METEOR, AND HE WOULD BE GLAD TO TRY TO CLEAR UP THE MATTER THROUGH CLOSER INVESTIGATION AND STUDY. WHATEVER STRUCK THE EARTH FILLED THE GROUND NEARBY WITH DIRT OR DUST AND KNOCKED OUT THE POWER LINES IN ONE SECTION OF TOWN, CONTINUING SOME DISTANCE UNDERGROUND. IT LEFT A WHITE RESIDUE LIKE CHALK OR CEMENT ON PLANTS AND GROUND IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA. IT WAS UNSTABLE AND DISINTEGRATED IN ABOUT 3-4 HOURS. CHARLES R. JENKINS, CHIEF OF POLICE, TEMPLE, CALIFORNIA. GROUNDS - ROPED OFF.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather shows a page from an old Project Blue Book document with text describing a UFO incident. I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

"Crater, estimating was about 40 feet in diameter. Inside the crater there were yellow marks like paint marks. He mentioned that he had seen some time before in this vicinity some yellow paint marks, but now that he looked closely, they seemed more like hue or discolored area rather than actual paint.

He admitted the possibility that he might have imagined the whole thing, but stated that he was certain he had seen some unusual markings and a crater in the ground.

One thing that struck the witness was the fact that the Army men were unwilling to trace the underground area, presumably for security reasons. He found this unusual and rather mysterious.

He was told by the local sheriff deputies that this area where the supposed incident took place was a site of an ancient Indian village. The sheriff pointed out some old Indian pottery fragments scattered in the area.

On the missing operation. We cannot find any record of this incident in our files. We have checked the records of the Air Force, Army and Navy with negative results. We do not know anything further about it.

J. D. Smith, Air Force man name added by a word crossed out. A copy of this report has been sent to 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron at Hamilton Air Force Base, California, for information.

Also a copy sent to Dr. Charles R. Hopkins, 409 South Eighth Street, Moneca, California, for his information."

Another datum that is perhaps relevant is found in the Los Angeles Examiner and Los Angeles Examiner, A.M. two days earlier. The incidents were awakened by the "so-called" thunder and lightning, and continued to be off the usual "hush-hush" way. A hole, about 5 inch wide, 4 feet deep conical, hole was found in the backyard of the home of said Temple. He informed the officer when he went to school, and told his neighbors about it that evening. Murray informed the Temple City of the investigation, and the matter came to the attention of the Air Force. It was said that "something from the air had entered the ground" â€” the possibility of a meteorite or "one of these confounded flying saucers" could not be ruled out, according to Capt. Jackson's report. Jackson said that they would continue to dig to a depth of 50 feet, and should not excavate the nearby vegetable plot any further. According to the attached military doctor report, there was no indication for all of the children California flying saucers. Of course, the possibility that the "object" responsible for the hole was a meteorite is strong, although some doubt was expressed. But the connection between this incident and flying saucers was not indicated, according to Capt. Jackson.

Capt. Jocloson, a Korean war
veteran, who was pinpointer, III, 
said there was a possibility
ive from a diving plane may
have hit the ground and caused
the hole. He said impact would
have been a single thrust
straight down.
The hole was noticed Tuesday
night by the gardener, and it
seemed what they thought was
some storm.
Sergeant E. L. Olson, air force
engineer Rollin W. Gillespie, director of the ground
team, said there definitely is a hole in

the ground about 18 inches wide and two feet deep, but they
could find no traces of a meteoritc
or other fallen object.
Earlier the Air Force sent a del-

experts to the scene.They first
lieutenant from Norton Air Force
Base near San Bernardino, called

"There definitely is a hole in

Army Digging for Mystery Missile Here

SAN GABRIEL, April 10 - Army bomb disposal experts today checked the backyard of a San Gabriel residence searching for what they believe may be a dangerous explosive missile.

But treasure not military are not sure just what the object is, and Captain R. B. Jackson said tests will be made to determine if it could be anything. All they have is handed with a clued at 8:25 a.m. Tuesday morning.

In made a crater-shaped hole in the ground, 24 inches in diameter. Experts said the object did not explode. But it could not be identified.

The hole was found by Oscar Murphy, that 17-year-old son. Pals says he heard the thump when it struck.

Murphy's father, Richard L. Murphy, called the Temple City sheriff's station to investigate. After deputies investigated, they decided it was out of their jurisdiction and called the Explosive Ordnance Disposal squad at Fort MacArthur.

Captain R. B. Jackson said the object was not made by the subject unit. It was a natural formation to those made to brace the object with steel supports.

Since no one can identify the mysterious object, it was transported from a local airplane to the 4602nd Air Force base wing at Norton Air Force Base, March Air Force Base, said Capt. Jackson. Meanwhile, Air Force sources emphatically denied any missile or its parts are missing from any military installation.

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The page contains a newspaper article with the headline "Big 'Unidentified Fallen Object' Hunt in Murphy Backyard Fails". The article describes the discovery of a sizable object that fell in the backyard of a man named Murphy, and the subsequent investigation by the military. There is no photograph present on this particular page.

OCR Output:
Big 'Unidentified Fallen Object' Hunt in Murphy Backyard Fails
SAN GABRIEL, CAL.-(A.P).-A small boy-said to have noticed the strange object during the night on the Murphy estate-reported seeing the strange phenomenon to his parents, It proved to be a cylindrical object about 3 feet high by 1 foot in diameter. A depth of 13 feet Army demolition experts stopped digging when they encountered the concertmetal hull of a 'flying object', and then as the hole opened they discovered there was no "buried treasure" after all."It hurt nothing if it is," they said, and so the mystery remains. His father, Oscar Murphy, called the affair a disaster. They called the Department ot Army and ordnance specialists pronounced the hole an "impact crater".
"We would tell by examining the hole that it was caused by an object plunging from the skies," the Army spokesmen said.
Apparently, according to the Murphy's, the strange object rested in the ground for some time after its arrival. A house cat had been missed and the discovery of the object came about through the searching for the pet. The cat, incidentally, was found by searchers at the opposite side of the estate, unharmed.
The Army unit at nearby Fort MacArthur decided something dangerous was at hand, and they decided to dig down to find it. The Murphy yard was heaped with tons of sandy soil and crowded with soldiers, their jeeps, and trucks. Earth-moving machinery ripped up the vegetation, pausing only when the concrete shell was encountered.
For in two days of digging nothing was found except the material shell, and the promised "spaceship" or "buried treasure" was not discovered.
Three are conflicting explanations as to why the Army dug this 15-by-13-foot hole, ranging from a "flying saucer" to "a meteorite".
Lt. T. D. Smith, of Salem, Ore., who directed the digging, remarked: "And there is, say, a rocket motor gone astray-and I'm not saying there is. It is a mystery, and I candidly admit we're puzzled."
