Transcribing the text:

Please add here any further comments which you believe are important. 
Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

I feel almost certain that this object was not an aircraft - at least not an aircraft as we know them. A pilot almost certain that this was not an aircraft. I feel almost certain that what we saw was a completely unfamiliar object, differing in shape, color, and flight characteristics from anything we have previously known. It was completely silent and moved in a manner that could not conceivably be a conventional aircraft. The flight path was very erratic, the motion almost impossible to describe. Some observers thought it might be one object, others thought they saw two or three objects. The estimated speed was incredibly fast, varying from 500 to 1000 miles per hour and probably higher. The object(s) were sighted by 10 or more people. Several of us observe the thing for several minutes. It came into view low in the east, passed overhead approximately a mile away and disappeared in the west. I feel sure this report is accurate and the thing we saw was an object of some extraordinary nature, very different from any conventional aircraft. I would welcome any further questions you may have, and would be glad to provide any additional information that might be useful.

As he left the direction of the light apparently the same general motion as the objects that were above them some time before their appearance was sudden and no sound of any kind was heard during the time the objects were visible. He estimates that the objects were visible for a period of about one minute or slightly less. No other details are available except that the objects appeared to be traveling at a very high rate of speed and no specific maneuvers were observed other than a straight line of flight.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 

FROM: (AGENCY) 5th hq usafa

TO: DISTRICT INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, NORTON AFB, CALIF.

DATE: 9-13-52 

PAGE: 1 OF 5

INTRODUCTION
1. A letter, dated 8 Oct 52, Enclosure 1, containing information on a flying object observed in Morristown, Tennessee, was received by this Headquarters. This letter was received from MICHAEL T. LAYMAN, 520 N. Street, Mooresville, California, and carried the following return address: 520 N. Street, Mooresville, California. The envelope of this letter was postmarked Morristown, Tennessee, and carried a dispatch number of 3-52, 11:13am, TELTEC BRANCH, MORRIS[TOWN], TENNESSEE. The reliability of the source is unknown and truth or rumor cannot be judged.

2. SOURCE was sighting on the front porch of his home in Mooresville, California, about 10:20 PM, 7 September 1952. He observed a single oblong-shaped silver metallic object traveling from north to south, and he immediately called the attention of his wife to the object.

3. SOURCE and wife agree that the flying object was as large as or slightly larger than the moon, and that its speed was such that it would vary from slow to very fast, hovering at times. The object was normally traveling at a high rate of speed, but at times it would slow down and hover, remaining in the same spot for about two to three minutes. SOURCE states that the initial appearance of the object was similar to that of a falling star, but after it commenced to hover, it appeared to change its shape and size, becoming quite large and distinct. He stated further that the object was metallic in appearance and did not give off any trail or exhaust of any kind. SOURCE and wife carefully observed the flying object until it passed beyond some trees which interrupted their view.

4. SOURCE initially writes that he could not determine the flying object's size, shape, or distance, but that it was at least as large as (1) the moon, and (2) very close. SOURCE states that the object remained in view for approximately 30 to 45 minutes. SOURCE states that it would be difficult if not impossible to clearly estimate the size and distance of the object as it would vary greatly from time to time.

5. SOURCE estimates that the flying object was light in color and seemed to have a dull glow or a slight luminescence. SOURCE feels that the object's color or luminous appearance was not a result of reflection from the moon as it maintained this color or luminous appearance after passing out of the moon's light onto the darker part of the sky. SOURCE further writes that the object did not give off any trails or exhaust which would indicate some kind of aerial propulsion.

6. SOURCE writes that he has ruled out the possibility that the unidentified object could have been a conventional aircraft as he is familiar with same, and believes that the only explanation for the object would be some unidentified or other aerial vehicle. SOURCE writes that such an "existence", however, would not coincide with the dull glow that made the object visible on a dark night.

The text output from the OCR is as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: BIO HQ 3DAMA
Norton AFB, Calif.
REPORT NO.
SDAA-13-1-52
PAGE 2 OF 5 PAGES

7. SOURCE writes that he feels his information on his sighting will be varied, but that he has explained the matter to the best of his ability under the circumstances. The source advises that he has reported his sight ing to the public relations officer and that he will answer queries on the sighting to the best of his ability.

REMARKS:
8. Weather and winds at the time of the sighting as reported by the Norton Air Force Base Rosier Detachment was as follows:

1930 PST, 7 September 1952, Needles, California:
Cloud Cover: Variable
Winds: Altitude - Direction Velocity in Knots
 2000'       330°       10
 4000'       300°       11 
 6000'       290°       9
 8000'       270°       17
10,000'      260°       19
12,000'      230°       12

9. No physical evidence of the sighting such as fragments, photographs, or the like were included in the report from source, indicating a lack of confirmation of some of the details of the sighting.

10. No interruption or identification motion was taken by the 27th Air Division (Defense), responsible for some in the area of this sighting. 

11. A report of air traffic in the vicinity of Needles, California at the time of this sighting has not been obtained.

12. Interview of SOURCE to obtain possible additional information or to evaluate reliability of SOURCE has not been accomplished. Reason for this is concographical location, time, distance, or SOURCE from this installation.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Norton AFB, Calif.  
PAGES 4 OF 5 PAGES
LT'S: Flying Object (Verbatim Copy)

Intelligence Officer
Norton A. F. Base
San Bernardino, Calif.

Subject: Unidentified Object

Last night while sitting on my front porch at Needles, about 3:30 P.M., I noticed an object moving from north to south and immediately called the attention of my wife to it. I have no way of knowing its size, except that it was, but I feel rather sure it was at least a mile away and probably farther. 

My wife and I agree that it was this shape [[diagram of object shape]].

Direction of Travel:
It moved at a terrific speed, like the above type does. It made no noise and kept on a steady course until it was out of sight in about 12 seconds.

In the opinion of this observer, I would estimate that this object was about 20,000 feet in the air, as I could just barely see it, and it seemed to be quite small in size. The color was light and seemed to glow, but we could not, at any time, see it very clearly.

This matter was light in color and seemed to glow a very dull glow, or was it some sort of illuminations different?

I feel rather certain that the object was not lit up by the lights of the city, because it was just the same dull incandescent color over the city and continued on over the desert. There were no clouds in the immediate vicinity, and it was only about four or more before the moon came up.

I have ruled out the possibility that it might have been a large flock of ducks or some other birds, as there are no birds or flocks of any kind near this area at this time.

I also have ruled out the possibility of its being a conventional aircraft, as I know these surveys, and I cannot find any similarity to anything I know.

The only thing I can think it might have been would be an atmospheric condition forming a cloud-like shape and sending it in a direction almost opposite the light prevailing there at that time.

Here's Flying Objects (Vermilion Copy) (continued):

Of course this does not contain the details that were seen at the time, so I guess I will just keep on guessing and wondering. 

All the forgotton will seem rather vague, I am sure, but I am merely explaining the matter of strange vague glimpses that I cannot clarify.

It is possible others saw this and have reported it, and if so, it would seem the more reports that come in would help to clear this much more.

I am merely trying to be a good citizen in reporting the above and should you have any questions on this subject I will be glad to try to answer them to the best of my knowledge and ability.
