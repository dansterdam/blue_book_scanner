1. Enclosed is a copy of AF Form 112 with radar scope-photograph of the El Toro UFOB sighting on 7 November 1956.
2. Since evaluation of this sighting depends primarily on an analysis of the radar scope-photographs, and since facilities for adequate interpretation of scope-photographs are not available at this level, a detailed evaluation by this organization is being undertaken jointly with your organization and complete analysis of the radar scope-photographs.
3. At the present time, it appears that the radar part of this sighting was caused by known types of local phenomena which affected the MCAS radar system. The visual part of the sighting, (which may not be related to the radar returns), have been caused by known phenomena and/or temporarily over-active imaginations stimulated by the unusual events of the evening and morning.

LENGTH OF SERVICE: 5 YEARS
DUTIES: GCA and control tower operator
EDUCATION: High School graduate  
QUALIFICATIONS: Two (2) years radar experience. ODASDCACC combined control tower and radar.
IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE INTERVIEWED SOURCE WAS VERY COOPERATIVE IN THE QUESTIONING. HE APPEARS TO BE GENUINELY INTERESTED IN THE REPORTING OF THESE INCIDENTS AND VERY EAGER TO FURNISH ANY INFORMATION THAT HE COULD ABOUT THEM. HE COULD OFFER AN EXPLANATION OF SOME OF THE OBSERVATIONS AS BEING NOT UNCOMMON OR OUT OF THE ORDINARY, BUT STATED THAT IN ALL HIS EXPERIENCE WITH RADAR HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THE RETURN HE OBSERVED ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION. HE WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ALL AIR TRAFFIC IN THAT AREA AND WITH THE USUAL RADAR PRESENTATIONS, AND HIS DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HE SAW SEEMS SINCERE AND CONVINCING.

ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, SOURCE WAS ON DUTY AS STANDBY GCA OPERATOR ON THE EVENING SHIFT AT THE GCA UNIT AND NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT ORBITING NORTH OF THE FIELD (MCAS EL TORO). HE CALLED THE DUTY OFFICER AND NOTIFIED THE CONTROL TOWER OF THE LIGHTS. THE CONTROL TOWER PERSONNEL ALSO OBSERVED THE LIGHT AND REPORTED IT TO SOURCE.

NORMALLY AND AT SPEEDS WHICH SOURCE ESTIMATED TO BE FROM FIFTEEN (15) TO TWENTY (20) KNOTS, THE LIGHT WOULD REMAIN STATIONARY FOR PERIODS OF TIME AND THEN DART RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SKY, DISTANCES OF APPROXIMATELY ONE (1) MILE, MAKING VERY SHARP TURNS AND STOPS. SOURCE ESTIMATED THE DIAMETER OF THE LIGHT TO BE FROM ONE AND ONE-HALF (1 1/2) TO TWO (2) FEET AND STATED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE FROM TWO THOUSAND (2000) TO THREE THOUSAND (3000) FEET IN ALTITUDE. HE STATED THAT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, THE LIGHT WOULD APPEAR TO FADE OUT AND THEN REAPPEAR AGAIN IN ANOTHER PART OF THE SKY. SOURCE STATED THAT THE OBJECT MOVED SO RAPIDLY THAT HE COULD NOT TRACK IT ON RADAR.

EARLY IN THE COURSE OF THESE OBSERVATIONS, SOURCE SWITCHED ON THE CONTROL TOWER RADAR WHICH GAVE INCONCLUSIVE RETURNS. HAVING NOTIFIED THE TOWER OF HIS OBSERVATIONS, SOURCE WAS THEN INSTRUCTED BY THE TOWER TO KEEP THE RADAR ON AND TO CONTINUE OBSERVING THE OBJECT.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight No. 45020 ATIS
From: El Toro, California

Report No. ISS-UFO(BSI-56-9-17 

The report states that on 7 November 1956, the Officer in Charge of the Station Rescue Unit, Captain L.H. Schleutsker, sent a request for a photographer and an order to investigate an alleged sighting of numerous aircraft at the station. 

In the ensuing hours, sources reported that numerous aircraft were observed over the station. The report indicates that the objects were described as silvery, circular, and appeared to be flying in a loose formation. The report notes that the objects were observed as they passed over the station, but with repeated failures to intercept them. The helicopters and fighters pursuing the objects were reportedly unable to get close enough to identify them specifically.

The report further states that one of the objects flew formation with the helicopters and fighters for a short period of time before departing at a very high speed.

The report discusses the difficulty the helicopters and fighters had in attempting to intercept the objects, noting that they were not able to close the distance or identify the objects specifically. It mentions that the fighters were able to establish radar contact with the objects, but were unable to reach them.

The report indicates that the radar sets in use were US Navy CPS-6A units, operating at a frequency of 2900 Mc, and that the objects were detected at ranges up to 55 miles.

The report concludes by noting that there had been recent maintenance difficulties with either equipment or the efforts of anomalous propagation, and that the station commander stated that the station's propagation had been observed to be extremely distorted during the time of these observations, making conventional identification and classification of the objects beyond the capability of modern aircraft.

FLIGHT: 1-6, 46020 AISS
AT 2130 or shortly after, on 11 November, 1956, a red blinking light appeared above the lower mountain range directly North of MCAS El Toro. USPO and MEE observers both sighted the object. The light glared (2200) 3 times, was on for short periods of time, 20 seconds or so, then went off. Just as the light went off, I sighted an object directly above and behind the light. This object remained on for 4 or 5 minutes and appear to have a tail and emitted a target 6 miles North of the station. From while the object on for time on the radar scope, and spotted the target 6 miles North of the station, this indicates that the object must have been approximately one to five or six miles wide (about one to five or six miles). The object then disappeared from radar. After the first sighting, I continued to watch the object with my naked eyes and with x10 binoculars. From while I was watching, the object remained in view for 4 miles south, then blinking on the station till reaching four miles South, then disappearing behind the station. This sighting is confirmed by four other targets (believed to be the same object) following the same course.

PART THREE PAGE 7 OF 12 PAGES

STATEMENT:
It approximately 2125 on the evening of 11 November, 1956, I received a call from the control tower at the Marine Air Station at ElToro, California, stating that they had observed several unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the vicinity of our unit and observed the objects myself. I called up the squadron commander, ordered up the squadron photographer, crawled up the shop control tower, and observed the objects myself. I called for a photographer, grabbed up the binoculars and watched the objects for about 10 minutes. The objects stated that they were on my trying but (I) could not observe anything. As about 2230 I had the photographer come out with about 200-300 feet of movie film to take movies of the objects, as there seemed to be a build up of some constant large objects in the area, without increasing or decreasing distance for a period of about five minutes. I advised Radar that they were on the screen, and they advised me that they were painted on the screen, then they lost them. As about 2300, then came back and refused. I then requested Radar to please contact the dispatcher at Los Angeles Center and advise them to notify aircraft in the area of these objects, so that they could also observe them. Radar contacted them and they replied back and we took off.
Again, at about 2330, I saw movement of some objects to the North of us, very close and after watching them for about 10 minutes they disappeared. We called Radar again and they reported that about 2320, some 6 separated objects were painted on the screen and the last time they were observed were at about 2330. They called back and said the objects had disappeared. 
As at about 2335, I again observed an object or objects, at about 300 feet, and seemed to be amber in color and hovering. Radar had him, he stopped as I watched, then the object suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared, all in about 5 seconds. I then could make out 5 or 6 smaller objects hovering at about 2,000 feet for about 15 minutes, then they too disappeared.
We discontinued at 0635 on the morning of 12 November.

SUPPLEMENT ARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS

1. The Ground Observer Center (GOC) at El Toro, California was contacted and it was learned that no unusual sightings had been reported to this place during the period of this report.

2. One of the Directors (Capt.) Norton AFB, California was contacted and the following information was received: 
a. All AAF sites in the Los Angeles area had been alerted and reports on all sightings were under contacts with unidentified objects during the period of this report.
b. All AAF sites in the Los Angeles area reported negative radar contacts with the unidentified objects during the period of this report.
c. Weather reports for the Los Angeles area during this period: 5/8 to 10/10 cloud cover, 6000 to 15,000 feet; visibility approximately 10 miles; a visible inversion layer was observed.

3. The Air Defense direction Center at Los Angeles was requested to monitor the area on their radar scopes at CDRCP. Their only contacts were those which had during this time and remain unidentified until 0630 EST. They reported negative contacts with the unidentified objects. The only contacts they had during this time were with two T-33's and the three commercial airliners which were intercepted by the Air Defense.

4. Palomar and Mt. Wilson Observatories were contacted and reported following the observations in connection with the time of this report:
1950 PST - AP # 1539 left departure point (undetermined) and reported over Los Angeles at 0100 EST at 14,000 feet.

This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report, likely part of Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings in the United States in the mid-20th century.

Transcribing the text:

1. To be considered as 'cause OF' 
2. Partly confirmed as one of those seen on.

I believe the bright appearing object were not free targets, but were probably an observation aircraft.
From the description of the object as moving rapidly and erratically, it would appear that the indications were of the type which results from such propagation peculiarities.

This document explains the sighting and suggests that the "lights" observed were likely an observation aircraft, rather than an unidentified flying object. The report discusses the characteristics of the object's movement and appearance, and concludes that it was likely caused by propagation effects rather than an extraterrestrial phenomenon.

The text also mentions that the pursuing aircraft never saw the object, or had radio contact with it, which could indicate that there was no material object present.

STATEMENT

Upon arriving at work at 2330, the evening watch informed us that there had been a "flying saucer" sighting earlier that night. There was a little discussion as to what they looked like etc. and I informed the individuals concerned that I had had some experience with investigations of this type (about 1220) GCA and the helicopter were working together on 26.8. The choppers used a searchlight to illuminate the field and GCA worked all night running intercepts on the blips. There were about 0630 all blips disappeared and the search was discontinued. Although I exposed the sky with the aid of the searchlight, search with GCA and the helicopter, I was unable to see any of these unknown objects.

FLIGHT 1-8, 6602D AISS
ID# 93
STATEMENT OF TOWER OPERATOR

AT approximately 2130 on 11 November, 1956, while our crew was on duty
in the R.F. sector, I looked through the binculars but could see nothing.
A bright flash, bright as lightning, appeared for 1 or 2 seconds. That
started an investigation. I kept in visual contact with the helicopter most of the
time he was there. At one time I thought I saw a light going around the 
helicopter but it disappeared, I would judge it's speed to be that of a fast light
bearing in a rapid static flash. I would judge it's disappearance as instantaneous. Another
time after the helicopter had landed, I sighted a similar light bearing
approximately 30 degrees from the helicopter to the east, moving at a rapid rate and
dropping from an altitude of 3000 or 6000 feet. This was very near the time the
helicopter was first sighted. I would estimate its speed to be around 600 to 800
miles per hour. I would say this is the only sighting I am definitely sure of. The
time was two heading in the same general direction.

The following account is a description of a tower of duty shift supervisor being in the control tower during the period of 1130, 11 Nov. - assuming the duty at approximately 2330 the shift supervisor conducting a check of the airfield and noted the weather Helicopter traffic had increased considerably over the normal in the next vicinity of 1130 - 1140 operation. The tower shift supervisor checked the weather and ascertained no change in visibility of over 10 miles with ceiling unrestricted. Several instances were noted of blips on their scope and described several as being as large as on RD and some being similar in size to F-80 aircraft. At 2330 visual checks, with and without binoculars were made throughout the night.

My experience as a tower operator is six years of actual duty. I am a graduate of the 5 phase pilots license and completed the advanced Air Control School at Olathe, Kansas.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICERS
1. The preparing officer was unable to arrive at any definite conclusion as to the cause of the sighting. However, since no other radar installations in the area observed these objects and no other visual observations were made, it is possible that some local condition may have caused a malfunction or peculiar performance of the radar.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICERS 
1. In the opinion of the Approving Officer, this sighting was caused by anomalous propagation compounded by equipment of the sensors, causing an apparent visual sighting to the radar observers. The following reasons are given for this evaluation:
a. Although the source stated he was familiar with the effects of anomalous propagation, past experience indicates that this phenomenon is often in various forms, all of which are not easily identified.
b. There are many radar sites in the area. Anyone of these could have been causing interference, compounding the effects of anomalous propagation, this making this phenomenon unidentifiable even to trained observers.
c. Although during vectoring operations, ground radar observed the objects on the wing of the interceptor, neither visual nor radar contact was made from the aircraft.
d. It has been noted several times in the history of the UFOB program that background has produced a normal phenomenon and then picked up an object on radar. These two objects are not necessarily the same. It will be noted that the observers saw visualize the fantastic speeds and maneuverability of the objects that were seen on the radar scope.
2. Therefore, an evaluation of "Other" as Anomalous Propagation" is given to this sighting. 
3. The photographs have been sent to ATIC for further analysis.

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. On 7 November 1956, at approximately 1900 hours, a pilot of an F4D-1 aircraft, based at MCAS El Toro, California, reported sighting a strange light in the sky. The light was described as a bright light, flashing at irregular intervals, and was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.

2. The pilot called the radar site at MCAS El Toro and requested that they attempt to track the object. The radar site was able to obtain a radar return on the object, which appeared to be moving in an erratic and unpredictable manner.

3. No other aircraft were observed in the area at the time, and the object did not appear to be a conventional aircraft. 

4. The radar site continued to track the object for approximately 15 minutes, after which time the object disappeared from the radar screen.

5. No further information is available regarding this incident.

LOCATION: EL TORO, CALIFORNIA
DATE: 7 NOVEMBER 1956
TIME: 1200 HOURS

1. On 7 November 1956, at approximately 1200 hours, an unidentified flying object was observed in the vicinity of the El Toro, California Marine Corps Air Station.

2. The object was first detected on the air traffic control radar at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. The object was tracked on radar for approximately 15 minutes, during which time it performed several rapid and erratic maneuvers. The object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and made several abrupt changes in direction.

3. Several air traffic controllers at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station visually observed the object during the time it was tracked on radar. They described the object as being round in shape and emitting a brilliant white light. The object did not appear to have any conventional aircraft markings or features.

4. No other aircraft were in the vicinity at the time the object was observed, and there were no reports of the object being sighted by any other observers in the local area.

5. The case is considered to be an unidentified flying object, as the object's maneuvers and characteristics do not conform to any known aircraft or other conventional aerial vehicle.

Subject: UNKNOWN AERIAL OBJECTS
1. At approximately 1145 PM on 14 November 1956 the undersigned observed a series of unusual aerial phenomena which appeared to be a group of unidentified flying objects. The objects were observed for an approximately 10 to 15 minute period as follows:
2. The objects were first detected on radar screens at the El Toro Marine Air Station and the Santa Ana Naval Air Station. The objects were reported to be approximately 15 miles southeast of El Toro, traveling in a northwesterly direction at an estimated speed of 700 to 800 knots. 
3. The objects were observed visually by the undersigned who were on a routine flight from the Los Alamitos Naval Auxiliary Air Station to El Toro Marine Air Station. The objects were observed to be approximately 10 to 15 miles off the starboard beam of the aircraft. The objects were observed to be stationary or hovering, and then to accelerate at fantastic speed to the northeast.
4. The objects were described as being circular in shape, about 40 to 50 feet in diameter, and giving off a brilliant white light. The light did not appear to be a true solid white light, but rather a pulsing or flickering type of light, with a sort of ragged edge to it.
5. As the objects accelerated, they appeared to change color, first to an orange-red hue, and then to a bluish-green color.
6. The objects were observed to make extremely sharp turns and reversals of flight path, approximately 180 degrees, with no apparent slowing down or hesitation. The maneuvers of the objects were completely beyond the  capabilities of any known aircraft.
7. At one point, the objects appeared to merge into a single brilliant light source, and then almost immediately separate back into the original formation.
8. The objects finally disappeared from view by rapidly accelerating and climbing at a phenomenal rate of speed.
9. The undersigned are convinced that the objects observed were not conventional aircraft, and that the performance capabilities of the objects were beyond the range of present-day aerospace devices. The maneuvers and speed of the objects indicated the presence of a highly advanced technology, the nature of which is unknown to the observers.

Date and Time of Observation: 7 Nov 1956 2050 
Location: El Toro, California
Observation Description: Three observers stationed at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station observed several unidentified objects on the radar scope over a two-hour period. The objects were described as bright, targets which moved erraticly across the scope until they disappeared from view. There was no visual confirmation of the targets.
The radar return pattern appeared similar to that of aircraft, but the intermittent and erratic nature of the blips on the scope did not correlate with the expected movements of aircraft in the area. The targets were observed for approximately two hours, during which time they maneuvered across the scope in a seemingly random pattern. 
Evaluations and Conclusions: The radar crew was unable to identify the nature of the targets. The case was considered unidentified due to the lack of visual confirmation and the unusual nature of the radar returns.

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT

(1) Incident #:  7073437
(2) Date:  7 November 1956
(3) Location:  El Toro, California
(4) Witness:  Wayne Aho, RADC
(5) Description:  Radar observation of a target.

DETAILS OF INCIDENT

On 7 November 1956, at approximately 1506 hours, a radar target was observed on the height-finder radar of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, El Toro, California. The target was first picked up at an altitude of 44,000 feet and a range of 90 miles. The target was tracked for approximately 12 minutes, during which time it decreased in altitude to 6,000 feet and increased in speed from 300 knots to 600 knots. The target then began to gradually climb again, reaching an altitude of 18,000 feet before disappearing from the radar scope.  

The weather at the time was clear and the radar operators were experienced. No other aircraft were in the area at the time, and no known aircraft were capable of the performance exhibited by the target.

EL TORO. CALIFORNIA
INCIDENT OF 7 NOVEMBER 1956
FILED
7 NOVEMBER 1956
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. On 7 November 1956 at approximately 1532 hours, two radar sites at the Marine Corps Air Station, El Toro, California, detected an unidentified radar target. The target was tracked for approximately 3 minutes, after which it disappeared from the scopes.

2. A detailed radar plot of the target's movement showed the following:
a. The target was first detected at an altitude of 48,000 feet and a range of 26 miles from the radar site.
b. The target maintained a constant speed of approximately 1600 knots.
c. The target exhibited a slight oscillating movement, deviating from a straight course approximately 1/2 mile on either side.
d. The target disappeared from the scopes after approximately 3 minutes of tracking.

3. Extensive visual and electronic searches were immediately initiated, but no confirmation of the target could be made.

4. This incident has been classified as "Unidentified" since the radar target could not be correlated with any known or suspected aircraft in the area at that time.

5. No photographs were obtained of the unidentified radar target.

REPORT AERIAL PHENOMENA (UFOB)
EL TORO, CALIFORNIA - 7 November 1956

On 7 November 1956 at El Toro, California, a radar tracking film was taken of a bright light object which was observed in the sky. The film and other data pertaining to the sighting was forwarded to Project Blue Book for analysis.

The object was first detected on radar at a range of about 70 miles from the radar unit. It was tracked for a total time of about 4 minutes, during which time it exhibited high speed, abrupt changes in direction, and a great variability in altitude. Estimated speeds ranged from about 500 to 1800 miles per hour. At one point the object appeared to stop and hover, then accelerate to high speed.

The radar tracking film, along with other data, was forwarded to Project Blue Book for further analysis and evaluation.

SUBJECT: Air and Photographs of El Toro USAS UFO Sighting

TO: Commander
Air Technical Intelligence Center
ATTN: AFOIN-4L1
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio

1. Enclosed is a copy of AF Form 112 with radar scope photographs of the El Toro USAF UFO sighting of 12 November 1956.

2. Since evaluation of this sighting depends primarily on an analysis of the radar scope photographs, and since facilities for accurate interpretation of radar photographs are not available at this level, a detailed evaluation by your organization is being deferred until your organization can complete a thorough analysis of the photographs.

3. At the present time, it appears that the radar part of this sighting was caused by some type of local phenomenon which affected the El Toro USAS radar site. The visual sightings (which may not necessarily have been related to the radar sightings) seem to have been stimulated by imaginations stimulated by the unusual events of the evening and morning.

I know every little bit of information may prove to be valuable.
May visual contact with the object be maintained if possible. I think you handled the situation very well. That U.S. jet aircraft had something strangely wrong about it. I think it probable that the object encountered was a nonterrestrial vehicle from some other world or dimension. Can you take a quick look around the area to see if there is any evidence remaining. I gave the pilot instructions to be on the alert. Nothing seemed unusual in the area surveyed. The pilot took off at about 3:00 o'clock position.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire. 3-5-57
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the
questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.
I was rather hesitant to make this report, as I am a retired officer and thought it might be embarrassing to do so. However, I have a deep interest in this subject and feel that everything should be reported in order to arrive at the facts.
I can add nothing to that which is recounted, except to say that I witnessed what to me seemed to be something from another world, and that the report is true and correct. The machine I saw come from outer space in my opinion is not of terrestrial origin. One of those wonders which I had to do with would indicate that we are not alone in the universe.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
Nov 56 to Dec 56
MAINLAND, FLA

I think I should tell you about the two sightings I had of unusual objects. When I was living near Salisbury, I saw a flying object (selection day). When I arrived home just before dark, I noticed two (2) large cigar-shaped ships which I thought were airships. They seemed to be about a quarter of a mile away on the highway which was about half of a mile away. They were side by side and moving very slowly. They seemed to be headed in the direction of our house, so we decided to watch them come over. As they got close--about two or three--suddenly stopped in mid air, then they seemed to drop something around them which appeared to be parachutes, and wobbled from side to side. Then a sort of dangling ladder was lowered, and it looked like a person was climbing down. Then they moved a little further away and looked like one big dark cloud.

It went into the house to make supper, and every now and then I would go out and look at them. The last time I looked it had gotten almost dark, but by this time the ships were three in number and they were side by side. About 8:30 P.M. there were two very brilliant lightning flashes, but the sky was perfectly clear. Evidently the flashes had something to do with the ships, for shortly after they were gone, and I never saw them again.
