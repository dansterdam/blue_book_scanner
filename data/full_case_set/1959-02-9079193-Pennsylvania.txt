Today I'm in line with what Major Friend told you March 4 that the Pennsylvania sightings of 24 February were caused by observing a C-47 drop flares and distress signals is too simple an explanation.

Ohio 38 14' and March should have had me report on that. Concerning the TV antenna quizzed by ATIC personnel is totally false. It might be a good idea to ask him to furnish the names of those who did the quizzing.

This is the same incident reported by Capt. of American Airlines. The incidents took place approximately 50 miles east of Youngstown, Ohio at 2040 hours. Witnesses sighted objects over Youngstown that were described as approximately 200-210 knots and the distance from the point of sighting was approximately 110-130 miles. 

A member of the Unidentified Flying Objects Research Committee, who is a member of the United Airlines, interviewed Capt. and has probably a remembrance of this sighting.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing an incident involving unidentified flying objects (UFOs) sighted by American Airlines pilots on February 24, 1959 near Bradford, Pennsylvania.

The text of the document is as follows:

"Dear Mr. __,

This is to acknowledge your letter of 6 March 1959 concerning the American Airlines pilot's sighting of 24 February near Bradford, Pennsylvania. In addition, two United Airlines pilots saw unidentified flying objects in the same general geographical area.

The geographical area concerned is bordered on the north along the New York-Pennsylvania border (near Bradford, Pennsylvania) and Mean, New York) on the route of American Airlines Flight No. 335 originating Denver, Colo. and arriving Detroit, Michigan, at 10:52 P.M. On the south, this geographical area is bordered by the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-Youngstown, Ohio locale over-flown by the United Airlines flights reporting this sighting.

The American Airlines pilot said 'sometimes the interval of the objects varied widely round the constellation of Orion.' This was initially identified as a possible solution by the Air Force in that the pilot's qualification was submitted but not yet been analyzed and that the findings of ATIC would later result in a considered analysis and evaluation of the written report to be submitted. The pilot's report also requested the desirability that he had witnessed a flight occurring.

Upon analysis and evaluation, this sighting turned out to be B-47 type aircraft accomplishing night refueling from KC-97 tankers. The American Airlines and Air Force records show that three B-47 type aircraft were in the geographical area mentioned above on the night refueling operation. This would appear to be one or more lights. The time duration of a similar operation wanders can last over an hour, depending on the type of operation. The KC-97 refueling a B-47 will fly at an altitude of approximately 17,000 feet at a ground speed of 210 knots). This would account for the sighting."

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text of the document is as follows:

Lights being approximately 30 degrees above the American Airlines pilot's horizon and his seeing them for 40 minutes. This coincides with the pilot's report of lights apparently below the United Airlines pilot's reported sightings at 3:45 p.m., 50 miles west of Ashtabula, Ohio. This would account for the tanker aircraft lights being sighted over Ashtabula at 9:15 p.m. The tankers had a ground speed of approximately 210 knots and were flying at 30,000 feet. This would account for the tanker aircraft lights being sighted over Ashtabula at 9:15 p.m.

These findings were made available to all media representatives through the Director of Information Services on 16 March 1959. The Air Force is well aware of its obligation to keep the public adequately informed on this subject and press releases are made periodically through the Department of Defense.

For your information, I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense press releases on unidentified flying objects.

March 6, 1959

Major Lawrence J. Tacker
Executive Officer
Public Information Division
Directorate of Information Services
Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Major Tacker:

On the evening of 24 February 1959 an American Airlines DC 6 was followed by many miles across northern Ohio and finally to Detroit by three unidentified flying objects. The pilot maintained visual contact with these objects and kept changing position relative to each other. The captain of the American DC 6 stated that the UFOs unidentified were not the ball stars in the constellation Orion.

Mention a few details in this sighting because a few AERON radio stations have announced that the Air Force has explained the objects seen in this incident. Has the Air Force released a definite explanation for this sighting?

Our committee has on file the facts that two other commercial aircraft lines flights, and both aircraft were in radio communication with each other concerning the sighting. We do not have a number of credible observers for this incident.

IF the Air Force has explained these sightings as the belt stars in the constellation Orion, I ask you for an explanation of how this is possible. Because of the facts mentioned above, which have been verified, the three lights could not have been stars. If the Air Force insists that the objects were stars and will not believe the pilots, then I suggest that the proper authorities to see that the Air Force explanation is investigated.

1. In reference to telephone call received from Sgt Bollig, your headquarters, at 0320 hours, 2 March 1959, concerning three unidentified lights sighted at approximately 0110Z, 25 February 1959, the following information is submitted:

2. The tower operators on duty at the time of the sighting reported that three lights were observed. After the lights had been closed there were three 2-1/2 in the area at the time on a high ranging mission. The tower operators made no report to the tower that there was nothing unusual to report. Furthermore, no statements were made to the tower supervisor because he did not want the personnel concerned involved in an investigation.

3. The names of the tower operators would not be given by the control tower supervisor because he did not want the personnel concerned involved in an investigation.

"4 February 1957 - Over Pennsylvania?

This sighting first came to the attention of the ATIC through a UFO press release.

The American Airlines office at Kalamazoo, Michigan, later determined a 26-year-woman had called the ATIC to report this sighting. Captain [REDACTED] of the [REDACTED] was making a flight from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] on February 4, 1957. The visibility was good and the weather clear. While over Pennsylvania, his attention was drawn to a "star-like" object off to the side of the aircraft. This object was much brighter than the stars, and appeared to be stationary. After watching it for several minutes, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared. The duration of the sighting was approximately 10 minutes. The pilot stated that he was sure it was not an aircraft, and felt it was probably a UFO.

An Air Force captain was instructed to contact the pilot for additional details. The pilot stated that the object first appeared to be about 20-25 miles away, and at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet. He estimated the size of the object to be about 3 to 4 feet in diameter, and the color was a bright white. There were no associated sounds or trails. The pilot mentioned that several passengers had also observed the object. The pilot was considered to be a competent and reliable observer. He was considered a steady, mature individual, not given to exaggeration or flights of fancy. The sighting was classified as "unknown.""

The text appears to be a typed report from American Airlines about an observation of three lights off the left wing of an aircraft on February 24, 1959 while flying over Bradford, Pennsylvania. The report describes the changing colors, positions, and behavior of these lights, and discusses the possible explanations and the observer's inability to identify the lighting of a jet tanker.

American Airlines, Inc. 
Flight 132 - February 24, 1959
Departing Newark 1910 arriving Detroit 2252.
It was approximately 2045 I noticed these three lights off my left wing
in the vicinity of Bradford, Pennsylvania. I was flying 8,500 VFR on top of
broken clouds. Visibility was unlimited with no upper clouds observed. It was
extremely difficult to ascertain the distance of the lights. The color of the lights
were from a yellow to a light orange. The intensity of the lights also changed,
dim to a bright brilliance. Sometimes the interval of the three lights were identical
to the Belt in the constellation Orion. Occasionally the rear lights lagged somewhat
behind. Also changed altitudes. During the 40 minutes of observation, the three
lights occasionally came forward from a 9 o'clock position to a 11 o'clock position
and then fell back to the original 9 o'clock position. Also occasionally the 
lights extinguished completely alternating from one to another, sometimes the whole
three were extinguished and during this whole operation, as I mentioned before,
the lighting changed in intensity. This action was not seen by regular but our
crew members and passengers on board and also by two other airplanes in the area.
The only possible explanation other than flying saucers could be a jet tanker
refueling operation. Never having witnessed refueling operation at night, I am not
aware of the lighting of the jet tanker.
My air speed during this complete flight was 250 knots indicated. I also do
not know the air speed of tankers during operation if this could be so. I contacted
ATC to find out if they had any airplanes on a clearance and no three airplanes were
given.
In summary, it was difficult for me to believe they were jets because of low
speed and configuration. If they weren't jets I still don't know any more than I did
before.

1. The following information is furnished in reply to your message, AFCIN-4E4G-8-1592-E, dated 5 August 1959.

a. Attached is a statement prepared by Captain ___ describing the incident. This statement was made shortly after the incident occurred and was obtained from the Public Relations Department of American Airlines. It was felt that this statement would be more accurate since it was prepared when the incident was fresh in Captain ___ mind, rather than having him prepare a completely new statement at this time.

b. The following additional information was received by telephone interview with Captain ___. The flight had departed Newark and was on a direct course to Detroit. At approximately 10:45 hours, at a location approximately one-half way between the Youngstown OMNI and the Sandusky OMNI Flight Information Publication Enroute-Low Altitude) Captain ___ sighted three (3) lights at approximately nine o'clock to his aircraft. He was flying at 8500 feet in the clear above scattered cloud tops at 5500 feet. The top of the haze layer was at approximately 5500 feet. The pilot indicated that at his altitude it was clear and unlimited. The lights moved off his left wing moving from the nine o'clock to the eleven o'clock position and back as he proceeded Westbound on Victor 116 until he reached a position in the vicinity of the Angler Intersection (Angler Intersection located on Chart 17 of the USAF/USN Flight Information Publication Enroute-Low Altitude) where Victor 116 crosses Victor 5. In the vicinity of the Angler intersection the lights turned toward the South and disappeared. At approximately this same time Captain ___ started his let down for an approach to Detroit. During this period he noted that the lights were visible Captain ___ aircraft was on an approximate heading of 280 degrees. Immediately preceding the sighting Captain ___ was in the left seat and was having dinner.

The text in the document is as follows:

The lights in the cockpit were turned low and he noticed the lights off the left wing go normal as the ship continued on its course. He then turned the cockpit lights off while he continued to observe the sighting. His description of the lights was that they varied from a yellow to a light orange and each individual light was the approximate size of a quarter held at arm's length. The lights appeared to be in trail, echelon upward, at an angle of approximately thirty degrees with a distance between each individual light of about the space of ten (10) quarters held at arm's length. The number two light appeared to hold its position throughout the period of the sighting. The number three light was quite erratic and would drop back, then fluidite and then will back into position. This occurred approximately ten times during the period of the sighting. Captain indicated at times the number three light appeared to be dancing.

c. Captain has been flying since approximately 1940. During the war he was a civilian flight instructor for approximately two and one-half years with the Navy. For the past fifteen and one-half years he has been flying for American Airlines. He has approximately 20,000 hours of flying time.

1. Analysis of subject sighting and report of Capt. [redacted]'s report is attached.

2. Upon receiving an unofficial report of Capt. [redacted]'s sighting, the Air Defense Command in Detroit was contacted. The Captain had not made a written report, and upon request of this Center, the Detroit office agreed to have the Captain submit a written report.

3. In the meantime, another report of two United Airlines pilots sighting of unidentified objects in the vicinity of Niagara Falls area was received. Both pilots have made an observation of the lights. The 327th Air Base Group at Niagara Falls also reported observing similar lights. However, a check was made with the 7732nd Air Base Wing, and it was determined that no navigational traffic was reflecting operations.

4. Certain descriptive data and that of the two United Airlines pilots coincide. It would appear that the same object was possibly observed by different individuals and the lights were probably caused by the same source. A check was made with the aircraft support systems project office, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, to determine the characteristics of a night reflecting phenomena.

Operation. The tanker has several groups of lights which at a distance could be one or more lights. The size and direction of a refueling operation varies can last well over an hour, depending on the type of operation. The 1957 refueling is estimated to be an altitude of approximately 17,000 feet at around 230 knots true. This would account for the lights being approximately 70 degrees above Capt._'s sighting and his sighting them for 40 minutes.

This all evidence indicates Capt. _______ probably saw a refueling operation.

1. THIS IS A SUMMARY OF THE INVESTIGATION AND EVALUATION OF A SIGHTING OF A UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT BY CAPTAIN ARTHUR E. BENDER, A PILOT, AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS ON THE EVENING OF 9 FEBRUARY 1959.

2. CAPTAIN BENDER, WHO IS WELL KNOWN TO THE UNITED AIRLINES PILOTS AND CONTROL TOWER PERSONNEL AT PITTSBURGH, REPORTS THAT WHILE FLYING RIGHT SEAT, THE LARGE GROUP OF LIGHTS REPORTED OVER THE PITTSBURGH AIRPORT WAS REQUESTED TO INVESTIGATE. THE GROUP OF LIGHTS WAS DESCRIBED AS LARGER THAN PITTSBURGH AIRPORT AND COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED AS ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA.  CAPTAIN BENDER REPORTED THAT UPON APPROACHING THE FORMATION, IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT THE LIGHTS WERE ARRANGED IN A SYMMETRICAL PATTERN AND WERE OCCASIONALLY BLINKING ON AND OFF. WHEN HIS AIRCRAFT CAME WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES OF THE LIGHTS, THEY APPEARED TO SPREAD OUT AND DEPART AT A VERY RAPID RATE OF SPEED.  THERE APPEARED TO BE THREE OR MORE OBJECTS IN THE FORMATION WHICH HIS AIRCRAFT COULD NOT OVERTAKE.

3. A CHECK WAS MADE WITH THE AIRCRAFT SUPPORT SYSTEMS PROJECT OFFICE, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, TO DETERMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A SIGHTING SUCH AS DESCRIBED BY CAPTAIN BENDER. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FLIGHT PROFILE AND OTHER ACTIONS DESCRIBED WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF A DEVICE CAPABLE OF ACCELERATIONS SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER THAN THOSE POSSIBLE WITH CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.

The text is as follows:

UFO SIGHTING OVER PENNSYLVANIA
Captain - 24 February 1959

Departing Newark 1910 arriving Detroit 2252.
I was approaching Detroit 2015 when I noticed three lights off my left wing in the vicinity of Bradford, Pennsylvania. I was flying 8,500 VPR on top of the scattered clouds. I was extremely difficult to ascertain the distance of the lights. The color of the lights seemed to change from dim to a bright brilliant. Sometimes the interval between the light changes was less than a second. Occasionally it lagged somewhat behind. Also changed altitude. During the 40 minutes of observation the lights made a complete swing from the original 9 o'clock position. Also, occasionally the lights extinguished completely only to reappear and during this whole operation, as I mentioned before, the lights changed in intensity. This motion was not caused by myself but was caused by four crew members and passengers on board and also by two other airplanes in the area.
The sighting could be confirmed by other pilots flying in the area who saw the lights and made radioing reports. Never having witnessed refueling operations at night, I am not aware of the lighting or the jets refueling operations at night.
My air speed during this complete flight was 250 knots indicated. I also do not know the air speed of tankers during operation if this could be so. My aircraft ARC to find out if they had any missiles or were given a clearance and no three airplanes were given.
It is extremely difficult for me to believe they were jets because of low speed and configuration. If they weren't jets I still don't know what they were. Due to the dark and strong lights I was not able to ascertain any size or shape. The altitude is unknown.
A check was made with the aircraft support systems project office, Wright-Patterson AFB, to determine the characteristics of a chant fueling operation. The tankers are generally in the assembly areas at 17,000 feet and above over an hour, depending upon the type of operation. Refueling would take place at approximately 17,000 feet and approximately 250 knots time.
During the investigation the Air Force determined that there were three B-47's in the area of Captain flight each during the hour of the sighting. All evidence indicates that Captain probably saw a B-47 refueling mission.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Pennsylvania
Date: 28 Feb 1959
Hour (Z): 2045
Visibility unlimited at 3500' - on top of broken clouds
Description: Three lights varying in color from yellow to orange, also changing in intensity from dim to brilliant. Lights apparently moving east to west
Direction of Motion: E to W
Satellites: (AFCIN-473; Phone 69219) Checked - objects much too slow and uniform
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.) Objects too slow for meteors - description doesn't fit - motion rules out planet
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-41): N/A
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.) Size of object rules out "ball lightning"
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Possibly aircraft
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Probably very good.
Analysis and Conclusions: Information from Pittsburgh is that a B-47 returning operation was in progress at the time of the sighting. The Air Force bomber and tanker aircraft were flying from east to west. Witness indicates he is not familiar with the flight patterns used during refueling operations, and the objects of this sighting were probably due to a misinterpretation of the lights on aircraft during a refueling operation.

This appears to be a page from an old document or article related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document appears to contain handwritten or typed text describing a UFO sighting and investigation.

EXTRACT FROM ARTICLE 95:

"As to the Air Force made call this the most superficial investigation of this incident, an investigation to said incomplete and inaccurately, and open to much question and can be substantiated. The Report, though complete, shows that the investigation was not thorough, neglecting details which might have revealed more significant information. The reason this was so is the great desire on the part of the Investigating Agency to arrive at the conclusion that this incident could readily be explained as a natural phenomena. There is ample evidence that this was not an isolated incident in that in the past scores of intelligent people have reported seeing these 'flying objects' regarding which the Air Force has maintained a continuous attitude of evasion or disbelief. The cases mentioned in this article are only a few of many such incidents which point up the fact that these so-called 'flying saucers' are real, and that the Air Force has failed in its responsibility to the American people to conduct a thorough and objective investigation of the UFO phenomena. There is no doubt in the minds of the persons who saw these objects that they were machines of some kind, intelligently controlled, and undoubtedly not of United States or any other Nation's aircraft. These so-called 'flying saucers' or 'discs' are something more than a figment of the imagination."

As Air Force's third explanation of his sighting, we plan immediately to publicize his story. Apparently Captain ||||||| has been discussing his sighting of the unknown object with a number of friends and associates, and the Air Force feels that the best way to discourage further speculation and unofficial publicity is to give his story official authorization, as it were, and to the public press. Some of the details in his story appear to us at variance with the official Air Force position, but we feel that the best way to handle this situation is to give it immediate and complete publicity. Apparently, according to the Captain, his sighting occurred while he was flying an F-86 jet interceptor from Washington to relieve the pilot of another F-86 which had developed engine trouble. He said they would go, but they would have to suspend me. I told them I could not cooperate. "The Captain then took off and proceeded to the vicinity of the unknown object, which he described as a large glowing spherical body, stationary, and making no noise. He said he made a visual identification and attempted to close on the object, but it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. Definitely, in fact, according to the Captain, the object was not an aircraft, balloon, or any other known type of aerial vehicle. The Captain said he would go, but they would have to suspend me. I told them I could not cooperate. Copies of the contradictory statements have been sent to several members of Congress.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

The information of the foregoing description was obtained from the informant by the Air Force who had it from his local Air Force contacts. He was an Air Line Pilot and his statement tallies with the report of the USAF Air Force Base. His statement indicates that he did not see the object, but was informed of the incident by the Air Force. The Air Force indiea~ed to him that the object was the type they had sighted on numerous occasions over a long period of time and that a preliminary analysis of data collected over these years indicated the likelihood of such an object's existence. The Air Force informant stated further that they were well aware of public interest in the matter and that there were continuing efforts along the lines of scientific investigation to determine the nature of these objects.
USAF informed the informant that the object was first sighted by their radar approximately 50 miles southwest of Harrisburg, PA, at an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet, traveling at a speed estimated by radar to be in excess of 1800 knots. The object was picked up on USAF radar and simultaneously observed visually by the crew of a USAF jet plane flying a routine training mission in the area at that time. The jet attempted to intercept the object but it maneuvered at a speed far in excess of the jet's maximum speed and the jet was unable to close on it or obtain a positive visual identification. The object was tracked by radar for a period of approximately thirty minutes during which time it maintained a relatively constant altitude but traveled a considerable distance.
The Air Force concluded that the object was not identifiable as any known aircraft and, while its origin and nature remained unknown, it appeared to be a physical device rather than any type of atmospheric phenomena. The Air Force did not reveal to the informant any further details regarding the size, configuration or internal structure of the object as observed on radar, nor did they indicate whether any photographic or other physical evidence was obtained. The Air Force representative stated that the object remained unidentified and that continued investigation was being carried on.

DC-6 PILOT-PASSENGERS SEE SAUCERS
Detroit, Feb. 6, 1959. The pilot of a DC-6 airliner flight, and three of his passengers, reported seeing three bright, shining saucers as they flew over Detroit. The airline pilot, whose name was not given, reported the incident to the Detroit Police Department. He said the saucers were observed briefly as his plane was approaching Detroit to land, and that they were moving rapidly and at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. Flares from the saucers were reported to have been observed. Air Force authorities were reported to have been notified of the incident.

KILLIAN AND CO. HELD FOR LAND FRAUD
Cleveland, O., Feb. 5. Two men, identified by the FBI as William Killian and George C. Killian, were arrested here for land fraud in the Conemaugh Valley of Pennsylvania, according to federal authorities. The two men, who operated under the name of Killian and Company, were accused of defrauding persons for land investments in the area, known as "Little Washington", which is situated in Conemaugh Valley near Garden City, Penn. The fraud was said to have been perpetrated through the sale of unindentified acreage for exhorbitant prices, accompanied by exaggerated claims of the property's value and potential productivity.

TEXT CONTENT:
DETROIT, Feb. 25 (AP) - A pilot of an American Airlines plane reported Wednesday that he saw nine "flying saucers" as he flew over Pennsylvania. The pilot, Capt. William T. Coleman, said he was en route from New York to Pittsburgh and had on board a co-pilot and co-pilot. 
 
Coleman said that for 13 minutes his plane was accompanied by the mysterious objects at about 8,000 feet altitude and the objects appeared to be shiny, metallic and saucer-shaped.

The pilot said members of the crew also saw the objects. Coleman said the objects flew in a parallel course with his plane at one point and appeared to be at a standstill. 

William H. Coleman told newsmen at Pittsburgh International Airport that "one would have to be crazy or a scrooge" not to believe him.

HELL SOUGHT BY RICKCYER
According to Venus Pinkell, From Feruson, Pereia
Washington, March 30, 1959 -
A woman in Ferguson, Peoria, claims to have been left unharmed after a hellish encounter with a strange object she says hovered above her home recently.
Mrs. Venus Pinkell, wife of a local salesman, says the object appeared to be "like a huge glowing ball" and left her with a strong odor of sulfur.
The object, according to Mrs. Pinkell, seemed to seek her out and hover just above the trees near her home. She says she was overwhelmed by a strong feeling of terror.
"I have never been so frightened in my life," she told reporters. "It was as if the object wanted me."
Despite her fear, Mrs. Pinkell says she was not physically harmed in any way. The object, she says, simply hovered for a time and then sped away at a tremendous speed.
Local authorities are investigating the incident, but so far have been unable to offer any explanation for Mrs. Pinkell's strange experience.

In 1958 the Unidentified Flying Objects Research Committee (UFORC) was formed.  Its birth stemmed from the realization that the public ignorance surrounding the subject of "Flying Saucers" or Unidentified Flying Objects" has commanded the committee's diligent attention throughout the northeast United States.  The committee has worked diligently through the northeast with newspapers, television, and public forums, and has provided speakers on many occasions.  The Akron area has come to accept the UFORC as an active organization in this area and the UFORC is an educational organization for the people, and should continue its performance.

Since the UFORC has gained considerable public recognition, it has been hampered somewhat by the fact that "factual reporting has prevailed".  Many people have been found to listen on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects, Scores of reports have been obtained from industries, universities, hospitals, churches, offices and other business, cultural and social centers, as well as from private sources everywhere.  It is the sincere hope of the UFORC that the people will continue to investigate and report such incidents to the committee, for part of its sense of urgency to the reader and in that way advance the case for UFOs.  

It is the aim of the Committee to explore in the immediate future the hands of the popular press, radio, television, libraries and persons, organizations and institutions where it is believed enough interest and cooperation will be aroused to help bring about an official full-scale UFO investigation.

At 6:30 A.M. on Tuesday, February 24, 1959 a flaming bluish-green object streaked through the skies over Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin. The phenomenon described was seen by several persons and lasted for 5 to 10 seconds, traveling at a very high speed. State Troopers at Bay City, Michigan described it as a bluish-green flame traveling parallel to the ground.

In northern Ohio the evening of February 24 was crisp and cold, the sky clear, and the observers reported seeing several star-like objects moving across the sky. This was made by several persons. This was a prelude to the eventual sighting of a reddish-orange object with a flickering yellow light on the top.

The observers phoned Mrs. Porter who in turn phoned Mr. Conklin, director of the Air Force Detachment of the nearby radar station. However, the phone rang again. The United Air Lines Flight Operations Manager at Chicago informed him that they had received a report from one of their pilots, who was alerted to the phenomenon, that one of their star-like objects had paced his plane for thirty to forty minutes.

The Captain of Flight 937 had sighted the objects at 6:30 and kept them under constant observation until 6:40 P.M. He reported that there were four objects of a reddish-orange color, about the size of stars. The Flight Engineer stated he had sighted the objects at 6:30, ten minutes earlier.

At 12:00 Flight 937 encountered the objects again. The aircraft's captain, Flight 937 decided to test the objects by turning off his landing lights. When he did so, the three objects appeared to move closer to the aircraft. They were then seen to fade. According to the captain, the objects appeared to be structured, white, and definitely larger than any star. The objects then passed the aircraft, veered to the northwest, and finally disappeared to the northwest.

These objects had been spotted by United Air Lines Flight 937. These objects had also been seen by the captain of United Air Lines Flight 321 earlier in Cleveland, Ohio. The captain of Flight 937 also called Air Traffic Control in Cleveland and advised them of the sighting.

WAS informed that no aircraft was in his vicinity at that time.
The foregoing incidents related by the two United Air Lines pilots substantiated the man
details surrounding the Captain Peter Killin Report from New Jersey to Detroit, Michigan, non-stop, and the
trip from New Jersey to Detroit, Michigan, non-stop, and the
across Lake Erie on to Detroit. My flight was at 8500 feet. and I was flying by visual flight
rules and an occasional instrument. The time was roughly 9:20 P.M. when I observed these
blights off to my right, they were about the size of a basketball, moving faster than any jet
all the sky above that layer was absolutely clear. We had a visibility of about 100 miles.
Either were definitely U.S. Experimental Government Test Flights. Roughly about
around at 9:30 P.M., February 24, 1959. Roughly about 9:45, while I was having my dinner
like all pilots do once in awhile, I spotted one of my windows to the south, three
steak when I saw them, but I just watched awhile without saying anything. These three
up slightly and then started to diminish. Their color was from a yellow
to a green, and these three flights were in a horizontal position.
was impressed with the sighting of Orion but these I could not figure. I looked and saw both the
for the identification Orion. Orion was considerably higher but also, the objects were brighter and of a different color. The objects were not by any means close to the plane, but much farther away. A while keeping abreast of
the ship, which was traveling at 280-300 mph. Their position was maintained. However,
the third object. which was the last one in the line, occasionally disappeared somewhat.
Occasionally they speeded up quite a bit and pulled ahead to approximately 11:30 
o'clock to my position, and then they would slow down and draw back to approximately
almost 9:00 o'clock to my position again. I was not at all frightened when I first
noticed them, but after looking at them for awhile I sort of got used to the idea of
seeing the "as strange as anything could possibly be", and thinking that if they were trying to do something
to the plane, they would have done it. But in that I had seen nothing unusual before
back to dim again. During this period, occasionally the light would be extinguished com-
pleterly, and I would see only two of them and soon the light would come back again and there
would be three. Also, at times when the three would go out, there would be only two that could
still be seen.
It was difficult to tell the distance because, although they appeared to be like the apparent size of the moon, they were definitely higher than 1.000 feet. In fact, I estimated that they could have been around 10,000 feet. The observed an interstice that was nearly clear, and on occasions when the large object would blot out the smaller object, the smaller one would reappear again. This could mean the same thing happens to a person would have a light in the middle of a dark field at night. It would be possible
impossible for you to know just looking at the light if this light was 100 feet or 1,000 feet. In all my period of flying, I have never in my life seen anything even remotely resembling this. In fifteen years of flying, I have never encountered anything similar other than that.

commercially - a total of about twenty-eight years. It couldn't have been an apparition because all five of us saw it the same way.

It had 38 passengers.- After I first noticed the object, I drew this to the attention of the other passengers and four or five cases came up, and the five of us actually sat there and watched them for quite awhile.

The passengers further muttering over in the back of the plane whether I should tell it to the passengers or not. I finally decided to. Before I did, I also told them I had only a cup of hot coffee with cream an also that there were no windows in the back of the plane. I could not distinguish any features or features in the windows on the left side. They aren't stars and no structures have been either like that. What do you think we saw with them to them.

There was only one passenger who was slightly apprehensive. I told him if there were any danger, I'm sure they would have done something before this. So what does one do? Occasionally they seemed to gather speed, but I obviously did not have enough speed to catch up with the objects, and I thought discretion was the better part of valor and remained on course. To enable the pilot to have a better look, I turned out the cabin lights and everyone watched the spectacle for the next 55 minutes. 

Unlike passenger VIP, the different passengers did not differ from the ordinary of average Americans. I can individuals regarding such objects has been sober or sane or telling the truth. Generally. though, you have to agree that was generally my reactions at the time. what we saw occasionally in patterns is things that I saw, did they belong to the Air Force? I'd like to say an airplane always has white lights, One is flaming light which almost resembled bomber, and the other is a white ball, the size of basketball, attached to the landing light or the tail-light, If it were really an aircraft, it would either flying higher or away from me, and in my event could not stay there for 35 or 40 minutes. 

Their uneven speed and unusual external brilliance proves they were a type of aircraft which is totally unknown to us. Their motion also was similar to an airplane. Occasionally also a red light, apparently lagging as if to let me catch up. The airplane was flying a constant course, I was behind. I considered th at they could be almost double the distance between the other two. I do not believe (the lights) were any natural phenomenon associated with this aircraft as traveling for 35 or 40 minutes. 

I had considered the possibility that the lights came from jet refuelling operations and suggested as much upon landing, when I was interviewed by the United Tinies. I find this scarcely credible, however, since jet fighters typically run at 450 to 600 miles per hour. I was going too slow for jets stay by my last wing for a long time. The other passengers were the minding position about the motion of the lights and there varying intensity. I had definitely refuelling operation but had made a check and there had been no such flights. I also notified other planes in the vicinity. When I was over Boise, Pennsylvania, I called on my company and explained the possibility, but believed the objects to be something else.

PASSENGER AND HOSTESSES VERIFY SIGHTING
Name of Captain Killian's passengers: N. : Detroit, Michigan, and General Manufacturing Manager of Curtis Wright Aircraft Company's New York Division, who said this to be true to the best of his knowledge, and one or more panicked or showed signs of worry. Everyone immediately began to show a keen interest in what was going on. He did a fine job. There wasn't a sound in the sky when I looked out and saw the objects in question. I have been making that same trip a number of times because the home office is in New York, but I have never experienced an incident like this before. When the object came closer, I could see a little tail like an exhaust. The plane's hostesses, Mrs, LeGate, 22, of Weston, Arizona, and Miss Beverly Pine, age 26, Oakland, California, said respectively, "I don't know what they were," and "I'm not a science-fiction fan, but I know what I saw."

Text from the document:

FLAGSHIP NEWS
Vol. 14, No. 4 - 401 Published by American Airlines March 9, 1959

Mystery Escort Greets Flagship over Phillipsburg
The 6:26 a.m. Eastern flight from New York on February 24 was greeted by an unidentified aircraft which flew alongside the Flagship for several minutes before it veered off and disappeared. The co-pilot, First Officer John Datl, and the flight engineer, David W. Whittum, were both reported to have seen the 'escort' aircraft, which was sighted close to the wing on the co-pilot's side. The captain, Peter Killian, was in the cabin at the time and did not see the unidentified craft.

As the cabin passengers were enjoying the routine flight, the voice of Capt. Peter Killian came over the public address system. He explained what had just occurred and asked the passengers to take a look at their little windows. "There it is," he said, "off our port wing." But by the time the passengers looked, the 'escort' had veered off and disappeared.

"They aren't stars," continued Capt. Killian. "No, it's not our imagination. We all saw it - the co-pilot, the engineer, and myself." He could not account for the mysterious 'escort' which had paced the Flagship over Phillipsburg for several minutes.

Captain Killian also appeared on radio and television in New York City. He accepted invitations to speak before the American Rocket Society and Station WCBS, Charlottsville, West Virginia, in which he vividly re-enacted his experience of that eventful night.

Captain Killian also accepted an invitation to speak before the students of the American Rocket Society in New York. This culminates his presentation in a taped telephone conversation between Captain Killian and Rush D. Holt, Jr., Congressman, West Virginia, in which he vividly re-enacts his experience of that eventful night.

GROUND OBSERVERS CONFIRM AIR REPORTS
Added confirmation came from ground observers. On the evening of February 24, 1959 the residents of Mrs. Betty Rennor's location at Cloveridge Street, Akron, Ohio saw something in the sky which they did not understand and could not identify.
Knowing of Mrs. Rennor's interest in celestial phenomena, they called to her. Mrs. Rennor reported that the object, approxhate size of the North Star, moving from east to west. Mrs. Rennor, employing binoculars, said that the lights appeared to be circularizing in a rolling motion. She then made a telephone call to the Director of the UFORC. He in turn reported it to Akron Radio Station WAKR, and requested that anyone having seen the lights should contact the Director.
Mr. G., who lives ten miles from the home of the Rennor's, related in the same fashion of observations of cloud-like lights accompanied by a 10 to 15 second interval between succession of bursts. He noted that the lights were not stars, and could not have been. Constellation Orion because the stars of Orion could be seen simultaneously in another part of the sky.
Mrs. G1 became annoyed at the persistence of the sound accompaning the lights. Certain sections of the city, observers reported hearing any sound. Neither did they see the airnlane which was about fifteen miles north of the unidentified lights, so that the object would have been out any distance of fifteen miles; but the observers did this latter time. 
When the lights were described through a haze preparatory to landing at Detroit. Michigan, they were spotted from the ground at 6:15 P.M. They were confirmed on the ground observers as circling the airport, following the lights of confirming plane, and consequently, that the airline pilots as well as observers on the ground were viewing the same objects, and not an illusion. Then the lights were heading west towards the Akron Canton Airport. The objects then were seen to the northwest and disappeared.

RELEASE OF OFFICIAL EXPLANATIONS
On the morning of February 25, in the Air Force maintained silence concerning these reports. Then on February 26, the Air Force intelligence informed UFORC that the object observed at Detroit and Akron were misidentified light of a distant passenger aircraft. Four days later the Air Force reported objects in a recent flurry of flying under reports.
This Air Force Technical Intelligence Agency at Wright Patterson Air Force Base that they believed the pilots may have sighted stars, especially the portion of Orion. It should be noted that the Air Force statement says the Air Force that their own men reported. The Air Force, then, in essence, admits that their own men reported seeing three lighted objects.

The text describes the Air Technical Intelligence Center's analysis of an incident involving Captain Killian's reaction to an Air Force offering, as well as details about an alleged sighting of mysterious objects by airline pilots. The text discusses topics such as cloud breaks, the U.S. Weather Bureau's verification of the incident, and the characteristics of the reported objects.

It should also be noted that Air Technical Intelligence Center experts formulated the opinion that Captain Killian's reaction to the Air Force offering was clearly in a statement to the Long Island Press. It was explained that when Captain Killian learned of the sighting, it wasn't until later that the Air Force became involved.

The document mentions that these objects reportedly penetrated cloud breaks many times, and those other crews have confirmed what pilots have said about 500 feet long objects, about 30 to 40 feet wide, and estimated to be going at speeds up to 400 mph.

One can only speculate as to why, after three weeks, ATIC experts were unable to come up with this second explanation to explain what was reported filed with the Project Blue Book aerial phenomenon. It was because they realized too many people had observed this sighting from different locations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. There is the possibility the "sads" as through broken clouds" explanation simply did not jell, and in truth, something unusual was observed.  All witnesses have agreed that three separate lights were seen.  Does this mean that there were three jets of jets and no some powerful lights? In a press release, Major Lawrence R. Parker, executive officer of the Air Force Project Blue Book, declared that the persons who filed this report were "quite reliable and their report carries weight."  In one paragraph the report states that Air Force RC-97 tankers revealed an Air Force team in Langley Field. Va. limited to lights of one color. Yet at no time were the lights seen described as being either red or green, both required colors for military aircraft.  When Air Force Long Island Dutton Field press agent in charge on March 24 Captain Killian said, "I don't care what the Air Force says, the objects I saw could travel at 2,600 miles an hour and were definitely not conventional aircraft."  But I knew what a KC-97 tanker looks like, and I know what it can do, and further, I know what they look like in operations at night.  And that's not what I saw.  Killian claimed this was the Air Force's third explanation of his sighting, "all contradictory and more fantastic "And furthermore, the objects were at least triple the size of any tanker or bomber we have.  And they followed the same course year after year."  That puts their speed at roughly 2,600 miles an hour.  The pilot said.
Admittedly, Killian had considered the possibility of the lights being those of jets, but "due to their size and brilliant lights on two sides" the varying color, the verning maneuvers," he varied that theory. Both Killian and the pilot of United Flight 523 had checked with other pilots in the area and their measures just seemed different.  The Air Force were admit different obstacles to investigation.  The fact that the pilots checked with Airways Traffic Control certainly lends credence to
ATC functions under the jurisdiction of the Federal Aviation Agency, their responsibilities being to regulate and police air traffic.  There again is a difference of opinion as to whether the lights observed fitted any known aircraft.  The purpose of this inquiry was to ascertain if the flight plans filed that might with ATCP-18 flight plans.

whether ATC would have had knowledge of high altitude operations performed by SAC. That again, 1948 figures are considered very promising by the RCAF, which you refer to as "Air Traffic Control."

The Aeronautical and United Air Line pilots, upon sighting the unknown objects, acted in accordance with standing ATC and/or Air Force operations to "report all sightings" and/or if there were any planes in the area. The knowledge of ATC landing operations also checked with ATC upon landing in Detroit, and he, too, received a negative reply. Their inquiries mainly were for the purpose of eliminating identical sightings, and if there were no planes in the air, their responsibility was investigated. The investigating UFOs, apparently did not even bother to check with ATC, and that prior to releasing their enormous publicity campaign, they did not interview Captain Killian in order to receive the passengers' or the ground observers' account of the sightings. Assuming there were operations being performed secretly, what damage could have resulted there. ATC could easily have replied that a secret mission was being conducted by the Air Force. Such an explanation would have dispelled all doubt in the public's mind. However the intelligence has openly placed Air Traffic Control in a compromising position.

"'Flying Saucer' Sightings Still Get Air Force Study
By Ralph Chapman
The Air Force is continuing to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects according to information received from the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency...
In the above newspaper article the Air Force attempts to confirm their explanations by discrediting the individuals that report the sightings. They are well acquainted with rules for controlling airline pilots from drinking before flights..."'

HOW ROUTINE IS ROUTINE?
"Basically, the sightings of UFO's by the general public have become routine to the extent that the investigators don't even bother to check most of them. They consider such sightings unimportant. As far as is known, none of these people were at any time suspected by ATIC. The allegation made by the Air Force spokesman about the unsubstantial non-military opportunists who are "making a good thing of it" and who insist that interplanetary travel is possible, is completely unfounded."

VOICE OF THE MILITARY
General Gordon W. Curry, U.S.A.F. (Ret.), former Navy missile chief, "Reliable reports seem to indicate that UFO's move and maneuver with such speeds as to indicate their motion is directed, not that of some freak within this natural law."
Colonel "FLYING SAUCERS" Albert M. Chop, former Air Force official who handled UFO information, "One thing is absolutely certain. UFOs are not imaginary..."
General George C. Kenney, former chief of the Strategic Air Command, "We're completed mystified. We have nothing concrete."
Commander R. W. Percy, U.S.N.R. Ret., electronics engineer for the Federal Communications Commission, "I believe that 1973 and subsequently are space ships from other advanced planets."
Carl Sandburg to say, the Tribune article author is quite aware of the prestige in the name. UFOs, it should also be stated that from this same document came the words, "I do not possess sufficient evidence which would enable me to draw definite conclusions." The evidence available, however, is convincing enough to assure a scientifically responsible investigation. "Such a scientific investigation, carried on with typical American energy, may be the means of changing stupid policy and one could invent. The public ought to be told the truth."

This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a text excerpt discussing pilots' views on "saucers" and the Air Force's secrecy around the topic.

Donald Keyhoe, Director of NICAP, declared that the Air Force spokesman's statement:
1. To offset the airline crews' reports.
2. To cover all airline pilots that they publicly ridiculdled if they publicly release findings.
3. To reduce the growing support of Capitol Hill for open UFO hearings.

In an interview with the Newark Star-Ledger (December 22, 1958), a group of more than fifty commercial airline pilots stated that Air Force procedures and conclusions concerning UFOs were:
"Pilots ridicule AF secrecy on saucers"

The text goes on to discuss the pilots' views on the Air Force's secrecy surrounding UFOs and sightings.

THE INEVITABLE SILENCING
known to this writer, Captain Killian is no longer discussing his sighting of the three unidentified flying objects over the Western Pennsylvania area. So compelled by Air Force instructions, through Air Force insistence, was forced to silence Killian, their attitude being that good relations with the public must be maintained. Consequently, the was requested not to talk.
communication subordinates at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., have contributed their share to the 'inevitable silencing' by consistently maintaining that pro facts in a manner that could breed more investigation to the subject.
When Killian, in a private telephone conversation, was asked to comment on this, he said, "Let's put it this way: My company won't want me to talk about it any more." And later he added, "I feel very deeply concerned with this loss of my own personal freedom."
To illustrate the subject reached confidential proportions, the following is presented:
July 5, 1947
Air Corps Spokesman at the Pentagon: "No investigation is needed. The saucers are real."
July 10, 1947
Air Corps Public Relations Officer at the Pentagon: "We can't ignore this. Too many reliable pilots are telling the same story -- hut -- until objective proof is available, we have no comment."
July 24, 1947
The Air Corps spokesman seemed to summing in the direction that the sightings may be one of three things - solar reflections - small meteors or icing conditions." 
July 7, 1947
The Washington statement to all press services and news agencies, emphasizing only two things: solar reflections - small meteors or icing conditions.
September 23, 1947
Official analysis report from ATIC to General Hoyt Vandenberg, Commanding General.
July 30, 1949
General George C. Kenney, then Chief of the Strategic Air Command, after the so-called "space ships" sighting by the pilots and a passenger of an Eastern Air Lines plane: "I wish we did."
August 6, 1949
To date withholdings of the situation by ATIC later declassified but never released, stating that the flying saucers were interplanetary space ships.

AIR FORCE and evaluating reported flying saucers. The reports are the result of this interpretation of various conventional objects, a mild form of mass hysteria, and unsubstantiated rumors.
Declassified Air Force secret summaries of intelligence investigations of UFOs:
"It will never be possible to say with certainty that these objects might not be real. The presence of such visitors from space, the intelligence report also stated: "Such a civilization might observe that we on earth are still in a primitive stage, and therefore they would not necessarily make themselves known to us at this time above all to behold such visitations."
February 22, 1950
Headquarters statement after a Navy visual and radar tracking report of two UFOs at Key West Naval Air Station: "There is absolutely no evidence that flying saucers or phenomena exist."
March 30, 1950
Air Force statement after the published flying "saucer" report by Commander (now Captain) E. J. Smith of the U.S. Navy, guided missile tests squadron at White Sands, New Mexico:
The Air Force investigated a number of UFO sightings at White Sands, including the report of an intelligence officer who recorded over 100 small flying objects at an altitude of 10,000 feet for 2 1/2 hours. When questioned about this Navy report, we have no evidence that the flying saucers are other than normal phenomena.
January and February, 1951
"We have no evidence that such objects exist." In general, such reports are usually explained as natural phenomena.
June 21, 1952
Air Force statement given to Look magazine by an ATIC colonel: "These reports come from sincere people; they are not crackpots. They are seeing something; we have to find out what."
From this date on, the Air Force has consistently clouded pertinent UFO information to such an extent that legislative bodies as well as the public in general are still confused. It is as well known now that the Air Force initiated the ridicule campaign as it was at one time that flying saucers simply did not exist. This secrecy and ridicule campaign
"On the other hand did deliberately confuse the public or that the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. The Air Force cannot make up its mind whether to tell the public after the tremendous surge in sightings by highly trained observers. It could reveal its hand and give evidence that the UFO's were seen, and possibly identified with a classified project - this it will not do - and seems unable to do to this day. Why?
In recent years the Air Force has been attacked and charged many times with "cover up" of misleading statements", "censorship" and "criminal negligence" in dealing with UFO's. Isn't it time this situation came to a forum?

Has American Airlines been intimidated also? Have they been forced to be an accomplice in this considered an infringement on his 'personal freedom'? Is this to be terminated by Air Force pressure? Why after the 'case and desist' of the ridiculous campaign? Does it consider the usual detailed procedure in security reasons, or is it to strengthen the unity of people in the UFO field? Contact should be made with the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. 1950 Committee, IWW is wondering what they are in cooperation with ground observer pilots. It is strongly urged that the Association and members give this their unequivocal consideration.

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY 

24 June 1959

Dear Mr. _____,

This is to acknowledge your letter of 15 June 1959 concerning your inquiry about newspaper articles on this sighting. 

The 1957 York Herald Tribune articles of 1 March 1959 concerning this sighting were factual and this office considered it accurate and authentic. Your interpretation of the information or your theories as to their significance are matters for your own evaluation.

However, the flying object seen remains unidentified, and basic observations and findings in the case have been corrected or supplemented from time to time. Any additional clarification will be a matter for future consideration or investigation in accordance with the progress of aerial observation developments.

Answering your other questions, the following information is provided:

The Air Force received a large number of reports from the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development. This case was one of many which was investigated and evaluated. Case files, interviews, and other information were assembled and conclusions drawn as to the nature of the sighting, although no positive identification could be made.

The statement you received was compiled during May 1959. The conclusions in your case were reviewed at that time and no further evidence was obtained for the specific items you mentioned.

COPY OF ENCLOSURE -
"Departing Newark 1910 arriving Detroit 2252.
"I was approaching a flight at an altitude of 3,000 feet, there were three lights off my left wing in the vicinity of the plane. The visibility was unlimited with no upper clouds observed. The lights appeared to be at an altitude of 3,000 VFR on top or broken clouds. The distance of the three lights was difficult to determine, as it changed from dim to a bright brilliant. Sometimes the interval of the bright lights lasted about 20 seconds, then the lights were extinguished and during this whole operation, as I mentioned before, the lights were difficult to determine. This light-change seemed to occur on three different occasions within the 30 minutes operation. Also occasionally the three were extinguished and during this whole operation, as I mentioned before, the lights were difficult to determine. It was difficult for me to determine other than flying saucers could be a jet tanker refueling operation at night. I am not sure of the air speed during this complete flight, but it was 250 knots indicated. I also do not know the altitude of the fighters during operation if this could be so. I contacted ATC to find out if any other traffic was given, but none was given.
"In summary, it was difficult for me to believe they were jets until I still don't know anyone else that was there besides myself and contacted AFC to find out regarding the low speed and some other speculation. Though I watched them for 30 minutes before, during the 30 minutes at 11 o'clock position and the lights extinguished, also occasionally they came forward from the 5 o'clock position to the 11 o'clock position. Also occasionally the three were extinguished and during this whole operation, as I mentioned before, the lights were difficult to determine.

able to ascertain any size or shape. The altitude of the objects was 30 degrees above any horizon. During the investigation the Air Force determined that there were three B-47's in the air at the time. Killian's flight path during the sighting. These B-47's were 55 miles from the objects.
A check was made with the aircraft support systems (project office - Wright-Patterson AFB, A.C. electronic laboratory) The flight characteristics of the objects were described as more lights. The time duration of a refueling operation varies, can last well over an hour, depending upon the type of operation. Refueling would take approximately 17-20 minutes. 
"All evidence indicates that Captain Killian probably saw a B-47 refueling operation."
This letter purports to contain a complete and exact statement from Captain Killian. Unfortunately, certain portions of words or letters alleged statements were made illegible by white-out or black marking. Paragraphs three and four would definitely lead one to believe that Captain Killian was not familiar with the refueling operation. Comparing this with what Captain Killian stated (page 19) Obvious, the two statements are in direct contradiction.
The paragraph five of the above report states that Killian, while viewing the objects, was not able to ascertain any size or shape. However, Civilian Saucer Intelligence of New York City, in an interview with Captain Killian, quotes him as saying, "They appeared to be fifty to sixty feet in diameter." Again, refer to (Page 5) of this report where it will be noted that ANC (the airborne refueling controller) body for fuel transfer both civilian and military) had no distortions.
The complete text of this Air Force report bears the well-known remarks of Air Force distortion. Note that the Air Force officer issuing the report presumably Washington, D.C. The question is: Was the check made to determine the true characteristics of a jet refueling operation, or was it simply made to add authoritative embellishments to an otherwise unavailable explanation?

UNANSWERED 'WHY'S'
1947, stating that Flying Saucers are space ships?
WHY has the Air Force concealed an official intelligence report, dated September 23, 1947, stating that Flying Saucers are space ships? This report was signed by the Chief of the Air Force and sent to the Director or of Air Force Intelligence to the Commanding General, Army Air Forces.
WHY has the Air Force kept from the public the FACTS concerning the sightings, which stated that flying saucers were interplanetary space ships? 
WHY, in the face of the ability, agility and acceleration of the saucers reported in December 1949, did the Air Force state that the sightings were hoaxes, mirages, hallucinations and mistakes by pilots and other observers?
WHEN the Air Force and trained observers who insisted that the "saucers" were unknown machines under "intelligent control" were suppressed and told not to discuss their findings regarding "saucers"? 
WHY, since January, 1953, that the UFO investigation be greatly enlarged and that the American people be given all information on saucers in Air Force possession, including the official conclusions?
WHY are Service pilots, radar men and other trained observers officially ignored?
Official orders are in force restricting the dissemination of intelligence information on UFO's to the public.
Official instructions to personnel of the Civil Aeronautics Administration state that all UFO's are to be ignored.
The Chief of Staff of the Air Defense Command has issued a standing order to chase UFO's.
WHY does the Air Force continue to spend the taxpayers' money on a global investigation that will not permit top-ranking scientists and consultants under secret contract to co-operate, and many top ranking scientists and consultants under secret contract to co-operate?

The text found in the document is as follows:

"to unite against attack by people from other planets?

The existence of official documents mentioned above has been confirmed publicly by Edward Ruppelt, former head of the Air Force's Project Blue Book in his book. 

The aforementioned questions should not remain unanswered by the elected representatives of the people. They, and no other government body, are in a position to eliminate the secrecy clouding the 1950 sightings, your-self, when all the 1950 information be released to the public.

This is a difficult question to answer. A solution as to how the release can be achieved may be further enlightened. It is a fact that since an airborne unidentified flying object case is established, then there is only one proper way to conduct an impartial investigation of the UFO situation - Only through open hearings in Congress can the secrecy of modern times be eliminated.

In the summing up the airline case we must conclude that this particular witnessing of strange objects would under most circumstances be substantial evidence in a court of law. Normally, if it were an occurrence in everyday life, no court would question its validity, since the physical evidence that may be presented in court of law. Rather, this has to do with a subject shaped by the "authorities" into something essential as subjectmatter, a subject which they themselves have labeled and qualified - and with the cooperation of the "free press", explain away as being normal observations, interpretations, misidentifications, instruments, radar readlings, etc. - etc.

Eyewitness evidence as presented in this, and similar UFO reports, cannot be accepted, if we do this then we might as well abolish all scientific enquiry, research and progress, in these fields - If the answer is no, then there is no reason to discard human evidence in the vast of unidentified flying objects and the double standard now being utilized should not continue.

The people of this, and every country, deserve to know all the facts. If an adjustment has to be made, it will be done, so that our existence on earth would have been brief. Indeed, this struggle for truth must continue everywhere - and in all things."

ADDITIONAL SIGHTINGS ADD WORLD WIDE CREDENCE TO REPORTS

On the evening of February 24th, two Scandinavian Airline pilots flying over Denmark, reported independently that they had seen a UFO. A sighting was made. While driving to work, in the early morning hours of February 25, 1950 a ground observer sighted the object. He described it as a dirigible. The object appeared solid and had a reddish brown color. It traveled along horizontally beside the pilots airplane at a distance of about three to five miles. It had a red light on the top front and a blinking orange light on the bottom. The man had been seeing this object for several mornings and he said that he had been studying it for some time. He observed the object change shape. It first appeared as a dirigible and then appeared to change into what he described as a rotating or whirling type of object. It appeared to be tearing apart in the middle and opening up to what he described as a concave or saucer-shaped object. This corresponded to the report of the pilots in New York and it was believed that they were observing the same object. It was by this time quite some distance away. When they lost sight of the object together, it was quite a long distance from their position.

The pilots also stated that as they approached Hobbs, New Mexico, they sighted an object and at the same time heard signals on their car radio. The object appeared to come very close to their plane and they stated that it appeared to have a metallic skin. The object moved away at a terrific rate of speed. An estimate of the object's size nor of the distance it was from them could be made. The Incident was reported by the Scandinavian Airlines and the control tower at Hobbs, Netf Mexico, corroborated the pilots' statements. Lindmister, the Swedish instructor who was a passenger, described the light as "a bright yellow light that was saucer-shaped. Then it changed into a round, bright light. It remained in view for about twenty minutes. Then it climbed away at a tremendous speed." (It was stated by Captain K. Killan.)

Radar operators, however, reported that they had no indication of the light on their screens. While the light was observed, it was not picked up on the radar. The Minister of Agriculture said it was "just what we have been expecting. These poor explanations have been the two things the Minister said it was.

Saucers trail AIRLINER
By Curtis Fuller

This amazing performance was witnessed by 39 persons on the plane for 45 minutes and 250 miles.

AT 7:10 p.m. on Wednesday, February 25, an American Air Lines DC-6 airliner took off from Washington, D.C. for Chicago. Aboard were 35 passengers. As the controls were Capt. Peter Killian of Syosset, N.Y., an airline veteran of 13 years, and co-pilot. Passengers were Edna La Gate and Beverly Pinzere.

After about an hour and a half in the air, the plane was cruising smoothly at 19,000 feet over Williamsport and Bradford, Pa. At 8:45 p.m. Killian looked off to the south where he saw three bright lights in a single horizontal line overhead.

"At first I thought it was the Belt of Orion (a constellation), but then I took a better look and it wasn't the stars and the foreign objects," Killian later reported.

"When Dee caught the expression on my face he asked me if anything was wrong, and I asked him if he saw the 'things' and asked him if there were any lighting bugs in the cockpit.

"The objects were by no means stand still. At intervals, they'd back again, and change its place in the formation, while keeping abreast of the ship."

Killian decided to let the passengers have a look.

The image appears to be a page from a handwritten document, but there is no photograph or image visible within it. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now transcribe the text found in the document:

Doylestown is 25 miles E of Philadelphia. The object was observed for about 30 minutes. It was round or ellipsoidal in shape, silver or aluminum colored, and seemed to be about 30 feet in diameter. It moved at a moderate speed, and was observed at an estimated altitude of 500 feet. There was no trail or exhaust visible, and no sound was heard. The object appeared to hover for a time, and then accelerate and disappear. There were several witnesses to the observation, all of whom were reliable persons. No further details are available.

The image does not contain a photograph, it only shows a page of text from an old UFO report document.

FATE
As things stood, Mr. Puskas used 
not have worried. Both pilot and 
copilot and 34 other passengers 
confirmed the story.
The way Captain Killian broke 
it to them was very clever.
"No one panicked or showed any signs of worry. Every - one immediately began to show a
keen interest in what was going on," he said.
"There wasn't a cloud in the sky 
when I looked out and saw the ob - jects in precision formation. They 
were round-like and every now and then one would slow down to let 
the others catch up as if it had moved near
er to the plane.
"We have been making that same
trip a number of times because the line office is in that locality, but we have never experienced anything
like that before."
WHEN Killian first sighted the
objects the sky was absolutely 
clear. Visibility was about 100
miles. There were broken clouds
below his altitude of about 5.500
feet but the sky above was clear.
"The objects were not over a mile above us," he said. "But since I didn't
know their size this was just an impres- sion. Later on I concluded 
that they were enormous, however, at intervals one would move
in closer then fall back into forma-
tion."

- page 68 -

The image appears to contain a typed document discussing a UFO sighting by a pilot named Killian. The document describes Killian witnessing a high-altitude jet aircraft over Lake Erie, which he initially thought was an airliner but then noticed it was changing positions, suggesting it was an unidentified flying object. The document mentions that Killian called the object's movements to the attention of his co-pilot and that they both observed the object for several minutes. The document also mentions that other airline pilots in the area reported similar sightings around the same time.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

SAUCERS TRAIL AIRLINERS

At one time Killian thought he was witnessing a high altitude jet returning to an airport but the varying and changing position of the objects made him lose that theory. 

In addition, Killian kept watch on his radar but saw nothing on it.

When his plane was over Erie, Pu. Killian called his co-pilot and asked if any other airline crews in the area could see the objects. Captains answered. One, a little north of Killian's plane, said he had been watching the objects for 10 to 15 minutes. The other was located to the west.

After Killian's call and seen the UFO's, meanwhile, although Killian did not know it at the time, three United Airlines planes along a similar route had also seen the lights. Capt. A.D. Waters and his Flight Engineer told Killian later he had observed the objects between Lockhaven, Pa. and Youngstown, Ohio. United Flights 237 and 321 also observed the objects and their crews discussed the sightings by radio with the United Airlines Office out of Newark. The Akron GPO Research Group also reported receiving reports.

There was general agreement that the objects were holding to a "formation." After he had begun his descent, Killian said the objects had begun to dim and had "seemed to break up into a formation."

The color of the lights changed.

SAUCERS TRAIL AIRLINER
"D. TO referred the airline crew's reports." 
As a warning to all airline pilots, it was suggested that they too would be officially ridiculed if they publicly reported UFO sightings.
The article goes on to discuss the growing suspicion against Captain Hill for open UFO research. 
On March 20 in Washington, the Air Force came up with a still a third explanation of the "similar sighting." It assumed that the aircraft were B-47 bombers being returned to a KC-97 tanker. The Air Force report said that the use of several lights during the refueling
operation prompted the airline reports of being followed by lights.
COMMENTS: No one who has followed this account with the Air Force's explanation can have much doubt that the sighting here was anti-climatic (which is the reason we are reporting this all) to add that Dr. William Liller, assistant professor of astronomy at the University of Michigan offered his explanation of the sighting. He said it was "temperature inversion."
A complicating factor in the green object, probably a "bright meteor" that streaked across the Great Lakes skies early on Tuesday morning, the same day of the Fishermen's encounters, was that meteor sightings took place from 5:30 a.m. to 5:45 a.m., which was

about 15 hours before the sighting of the UFO reported here. 
The color of the meteor at first appeared as orange, changing to blue, green and white, and then apparently the object exploded. It was visible in the northwest, and disappeared in the northwest. It was visible in Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois and Minnesota. Except for the longitude and latitude, the details are quite similar to the sighting
some observers believed they watched it for 15 to 30 seconds and had time to stop their cars and get out before the object disappeared. This was a meteor.
It was not, apparently, a temperature inversion.

THE HUMAN MIND is a strange instrument. It seeks constantly to explain the inexplicable in terms of the familiar. It resists the unfamiliar almost automatically. Thus it seems that Mr. Puscas, a civilian with the Air Force, who had enthusiastically signed a contract with Killian, was relieved to accept the Air Force explanation of jet tanker operations.

Our old friends the Detroit Times, "I don't know," says the man, "but the facts that they may have been more familiar - but I'm surprised to the fact that they may have been more advanced than ours, declared Colonel James. 

The fact that the others did not seem surprised, as Killian and the other airline crew and passengers really saw what they reported the UFO's would have to come from a civilization far more advanced than ours, declared Colonel James.

AT FIRST THERE WERE
from the Air Force on Captain
Killian's report, Three days
later, on February 28, the Air Force
issued a statement through the
Technical Intelligence Center that
the report made on the 25th had
been "carefully considered" and
the Belt of Orion. Glimpsed through
broken clouds, said the AF report,
"Killian's stars created an illusion of
moving objects, deceiving the
observer."
In support of this judgment, the
AF FORCE declared that one of its
report planes flying from Washing-
ton to Dayton that same night
had been photographed through the
clouds at 8,500 feet and could vouch
for the illusion.
COMMENT: Captain Killian
stated that other observers
at the same time, that the airplane
was above the clouds and had about
100 miles visibility. In addition, it
was frequently possible for the observers to see the airplane, the UFO's
at the same time. It
seems unlikely that six airplane
crews and all their passengers were
befuddled.
Killian further declared that "no
experienced pilot is going to be de-
ceived like that. We all see stars
and clouds a thousand times this
same."
In addition, the only clouds
we had that night were broken
below us."
An Air Force spokesman public-
ly rebuked "flying saucers" -- he
pressed some sarcastic remarks
about their seeming "can't
remember anything when they sober
up next day." This statement was
reported in the New York Herald
Tribune.
COMMENT: Captain Killian
took particular exception to this
statement, pointing out that the Air
Force never produced the pilots who
drink before flights -- "it's one of
our strictest rules."
Donald Keyhoe, director of
NICAP, declared that the Air
Force spokesman's statement was
obviously meant to serve their own
purposes.

The text describes an incident involving a UFO sighting by a commercial airline crew and passengers over the state of Ohio on February 25, 1959.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

THE IRANIAN AFFAIR CONCERNS THE SIGHTING OF FLYING UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS OVER THE UNITED STATES ON FEBRUARY 25, 1959, WHEN A COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CREW AND PASSENGERS WERE ALERTED TO THE UNUSUAL ACTIVITY IN THE SKIES OVER OHIO ON THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 25, 1959.

THE INCIDENT REPORTEDLY OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 8:30 P.M. WHEN AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 593, EN ROUTE FROM NEW YORK TO SAN FRANCISCO, CROSSED OVER OHIO AND THE CREW AND PASSENGERS SIGHTED SEVERAL FAST-MOVING OBJECTS IN THE AIR. CAPT. WILLIAM NASH, THE PILOT, FIRST SIGHTED THREE BRIGHT LIGHTS IN THE NIGHT SKY AND IMMEDIATELY ALERTED THE CREW AND PASSENGERS.

CAPT. NASH HAD FIRST SIGHTED THE OBJECTS AT 8:45 P.M. AS HE WAS TRYING TO LAND THE AIRLINER AND WAS BETWEEN PITTSBURGH AND YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, MRS. WILLIAM FORTENBERRY, A PASSENGER, ALSO SIGHTED THE OBJECTS AND REPORTED THEM TO THE CREW.

ON NOTICING THE STRANGE OBJECTS, CAPT. NASH TURNED ON HIS LANDING LIGHTS IN ORDER TO GET A BETTER VIEW. HE THEN INFORMED THE GROUND CONTROL STATION OF THEIR PRESENCE. FOR THE NEXT 12 TO 15 MINUTES, CAPT. NASH AND HIS CREW WATCHED THE OBJECTS MANEUVERING IN THE NIGHT SKY. WHILE THEY MAINTAINED THEIR ORIGINAL COURSE, THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED TO SUDDENLY CHANGE COURSE AND SPEED. THEY COULD BE SEEN CLEARLY IN THE SKY, FIRST HOVERING, THEN DARTING AWAY AT TREMENDOUS SPEED. 

THIS INCIDENT REPORTEDLY REACHED NATIONAL ATTENTION WHEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE QUESTIONED CAPT. NASH AND HIS CREW. THEY WERE APPARENTLY INTERESTED IN THE EVENT, ALTHOUGH THEY DECLINED TO MAKE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENT REGARDING IT.

AIR FORCE FIGHT ON "KILLIAN 'SAUCER'

A DID KILLIAN REALLY SEE A UFO? IT'S STILL HARD TO TELL

Virtually nothing has been said publicly by the Air Force on the alleged sighting of an unidentified flying object by Capt. Edward J. Killian, USAF, of the 780th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron near Bradford, Pennsylvania, on 9 February 1959, said to have lasted for nearly 45 minutes.

The various reports indicate that Killian sighted the object at about 10:50 p.m. EST while on a routine radar operation. He said he watched the object through binoculars and that it appeared to be brightly lit from the inside. It was traveling at a very high speed, apparently faster than any known aircraft. The object apparently disappeared at about 11:35 p.m. EST.

All the UFO people have happened to the UFO bandwagon, which is strange that some so say there is evidence that civilians and military observers rarely see the same aerial phenomenon. The only evidences are the stars in the belt of Orion and the aerial photograph during the Tremonton, Utah, sighting in 1952. Visually, we see the stars and no one would contest that, but the interpretation of the Tremonton film remains a moot point.

So we have to limit ourselves to the following facts: 1.) What Killian saw, if anything, and 2.) Whether it was an aircraft or an unidentified flying object. Capt. Killian told the Air Force investigators that the varying intensity of the light bothered them and they could not explain it.

Capt. Killian also said that he was sent too late to verify if the jet which was said to have been in the area at the time was still there. Also the copilot said that he could not see the object and the only other witness, the radar man, said that the scope was fluctuating so much that he could not pin it down. These are about all the facts we have concerning this alleged sighting.

The geographical area concerned we are told, is the northern part of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, district, close to the New York border, which is a region known to be criss-crossed by commercial air traffic and military flight operations. It is possible, therefore, that what Killian saw was an aircraft, though qualifying the statement that "it was faster than any known aircraft" would be unsafe upon the evidence available. The American Airlines pilot said sometimes the interval of three lights was considerable, 10 to 15 minutes, so this could account for Killian's sighting as a possible confusion by the Air Force with the qualifying statement that the report "would be passed upon a complete investigation."

AIR FORCE FLIGHT ON 9 FEB 59

On 9 February 1959 near Pittston, Pennsylvania, the pilot of an American Airlines flight reported that he had sighted a strange object in the sky. This object was observed by the copilot and two flight engineers. The report states that the object was described as a "white light" which was approaching their aircraft from behind at a high rate of speed. The object then is said to have made a sudden change in direction and speed, disappearing from view.

The document discusses the sighting and the Air Force's response, which involved further investigation. It also mentions that there were several unanswered questions regarding the incident, and the Air Force requested additional information from the American Airlines pilot.

TEXT OUTPUT:

Dear Mr. Tacker:

The reports in the newspapers that we carry on our DCA747, 707 and other aircraft were caused by a C-band radar on the aircraft. This radar was installed to detect thunder clouds and avoid them . It is entirely for that purpose and has nothing whatever to do with the detection of other aircraft.

The presence of other aircraft at this time is valueless in respect of the presence of the unidentified radar blips seen by the pilot's radar set. We have found that in most collision evasion measures it is difficult to determine the presence or absence of other aircraft in the vicinity, even during the day-time operation of the radar set.

Unfortuantely, this equipment gives indications as if it were to be man-made objects through natural radar reflections. Our operations and technical analysis indicates that this equipment has no capability to detect anything other than thunder storms. This is accepted by expert Air Force opinions. 

We trust this letter formally replies to your question. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
FRANKLIN W. KACKER

SAUCER FEAR ALINED
There was a certain apprehension among scientists and the public that reported "sightings" of UFOS were not subject to scientific investigation and that anything unusual in the sky was likely to he described as a UFO, despite the scientific knowledge at that time.

A few days later, on March 11, when another Director's Office of Scientific Investigation was made, this comprehensive, careful and objective search and evaluation program was laid to keep the wite open.

The statement that the American public was distrustful of the aggressive "skeptical" UFOS. It is not beyond possibility that some of the reported sightings are of phenomena from other worlds, it still seems reasonable to assume that the greater proportion of them are of the earth's atmosphere or result from faulty human evaluation. Until we get more proof, we probably should be willing to study and investigate all reports with an open yet critical mind.

Text extracted from the document:

The incident described in the original report indicates that the object observed was neither an airplane nor a natural phenomenon. All aspects of the report suggest an unidentified flying object of some sort. The movement, speed, and maneuverability of the object as described are characteristic of a structured craft of unknown origin. No positive identification could be made from the information available.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 25 - THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
This, all the way to Detroit, and the pilot lost sight of them only when he headed to let down through the haze for a landing.
Reporters and photographers were waiting to interview him, and next day's Detroit Times carried a banner headline, "Mystery Pilots Land, Won't Talk, Photo of the scene shows a picture in which Captain Killian flanked
by the Detroit Police officers standing with three men who laid claim as pilots of the strange craft which landed in Detroit with the Detroit ATC, who did not know of any scheduled refueling operation.  The pilot reported his experience to officials of American Airlines, and next day returned to New York where again he was besieged by reporters and photographers.  Meanwhile, following standard CIRVIS procedure (Communication Instruction for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings from Aircraft), the Manager of Operations of American Airlines reported the incident to ATC at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
In New York the day after the sighting Captain Killian gave a telephone interview to Radio Station WCHS, Charleston, West Virginia, describing his experience. Following the customary procedure, intelligence officer from Mitchell Air Force Base questioned Captain Killian, and in the talk with intelligence officers Captain Killian made the same statements he had made to American Airlines' officials. He didn't know what the lights were, and he couldn't tell how far away they were because he didn't know their size or their altitude [sic].
Not for months had such a good flying-saucer story appeared, and the newspapers made the most of it. Among the first to assert that the unknown lights had been flying saucers was the UFO Research Committee of Akron, Ohio (see Chapter xll). Members of the committee had received the news by telephone, even before Captain Killian's plane landed at Detroit, from the pilot of a United Airlines plane who had watched the lights on his flight to Akron.
Captain Killian himself described the UFO program in New York, Long John Nebel's after-midnight program in New York, Captain Killian visited a New York UFO organization, Civilian Saucer Intelligence (CSI), and appeared on several radio and TV programs. Both saucer addicts and newsmen besieged Air Force representatives, demanding an immediate explanation of the sighting. Finally, on February 25, only two days after receiving the report from American Airlines, ATIC yielded to public pressure and produced a tentative theory: it was possible that the pilot might have sighted the stars of Orion, as Captain Killian had first suggested. However, the release added no definite conclusion could be reached until all the facts had been studied.
I am slightly expecting the possibility that we might have been looking at some pilots who have solved the problem of space travel, and that they have solved the problems of their vehicles, coming and going at tremendous speeds."

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 26-THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
Island Daily Press he stated that the things he saw could not have been farriers, what he knew as "B-47 bombers and RC-97 tankers looked like, and how they looked in operation at night. (Original statement to Airforce, Never having witnessed refueling operations at night. I am not aware of the lighting of jet tankers.") Also, he told the Daily Press, the objects he saw were at least triple the size of any known tanker or bomber. (Original statement to American Airlines: "Due to the dark and strong lights I was not able to ascertain any size or shape.") Furthermore, the unknown had been far too fast to be any fast bomber known. (Original statement to American Airlines: ". . . it was difficult for me to believe they were jet bombers.")
In rejecting the Air Force explanation of this incident, flying-saucer addicts tendered several embarrassing questions: If Captain Killian actually saw interplanetary craft, how did he fail to see the earthly aircraft operating at the same time and place? If the unknowns moved at a speed of 3,000 miles an hour, how did Captain Killian and the crews of several other planes, flying at less than 300 miles an hour, keep the unknowns in sight for forty minutes? In that length of time the UFOs should have covered most of the distance to the Pacific.
Few persons given the facts by responsible officials would persist in the enthusiasm of the tamers and continue in a belief of flying saucers to occupy the relevant cubic area of space. To the true enthusiast, however, these refuting plans remain inconvertible proof that "spacecraft" are among us.

The Killian Case
The most famous UFO sighting of this type is the Killian case. On the evening of February 24, 1953, an American Airlines plane was taking off from Seward Air Force Base near Detroit. At about 5:45 p.m., when the plane was climbing to 1,800 feet, Rennebohn, the pilot, Captain Killian, noticed a strange light in the sky. There seemed to be three, their colors changing from yellow to their coming and brightening in intensity and shifting their relative positions. At first he supposed it was looking at the constellation Orion, for the lights had the same configuration as the stars in Orion's "belt", but when the lights changed position and he could see distant in addition to the lights, he discarded his first theory. He considered the possibility of a jet tanker refueling, but he couldn't think of any ordinary explanation- - but he had long wondered what truth there was in the idea of flying saucers and had thought "there must be something to it". Over the loud speaker he remarked to the passengers that American Airlines planes were looking at a strange light. He continued to watch the lights as he flew west toward Detroit, and noticed two other American Airlines planes in the area. Learning that their pilots were also watching the unusual spectacle, he notified Air Traffic Control (ATC) in Detroit. The lights remained in view for about forty minutes.

Transcription of the text in the document:

ATIC had been collecting facts and trying to analyze them. The basic piece of evidence was Captain Killian's own report to American Airlines, made a few hours after the incident took place. After describing the circumstances of the sighting, the statement continues:

"The only possible explanation other than flying saucers could be jet tankers. My air speed during the complete flight was 250 knots, indicated. I also do not know the air speed of tankers during operations if this could be so. I considered ATIC to find out if they had any airplanes on a clearance and no three airplanes were given.

"It was a sunny day and was difficult for me to believe they were jets because of low speed and configuration. If they weren't jets I still don't know what they were. I did believe even though I watched them for forty minutes before. Due to the dark and stormy haze I was not able to ascertain any size or shape. The altitude of the objects was so degrees above my horizon. Distance away is unknown." [2]

Almost equally important was the evidence of other witnesses. Several persons on the ground in and near Akron had seen them between 6:15 and 8:59.

Air Force investigators methodically gathered the facts and made their analysis public on March 16, only twenty days after the sighting. They released a summary to the press. The mysterious lights belonged to normal terrestrial aircraft. Although ATIC at Detroit had apparently not had the information when they asked, there 8-47 bombers of the Strategic Air Command had been carrying out a night refueling operation from KC-97 tankers at the time and place reported. The tankers had several groups of lights which, from a distance, looked very much like the three objects described by Captain Killian. Such a refueling operation takes from about forty minutes to more than an hour.

Captain Killian had been flying at an altitude of 8,500 feet, and he had given the location of the unknown as 50 degrees above his horizon; this agreed with the position of the tankers, which were operating at an altitude of 17,000 feet. Captain Killian had been flying west at an indicated air speed of 250 knots; the refueling tankers had also been flying west at a true air speed of 200 knots. So, parallel, the tankers had remained in view and would have arrived over Akron just about the time that ground observers reported the lights.

Everything checked. Every detail of the incident was accounted for by the refueling operation, much to the consternation of the saucer enthusiasts, who called it, among other things, "imaginative." Skeptics asserted that the "Orion" theorists were defeated immediately after the sighting had been made, and that the experts had been "forced to come up with the second explanation"--which they greeted with equal indignation.

Captain Killian, too, had apparently forgotten his first report. On March 25, a month later, he was interviewed by the Life magazine correspondent. Killian reverted to the original story, though he admitted that the Air Force explanation was probably correct.

UFO INVESTIGATOR JUL-AUG 1960

CHAPTER II - The William Killian Case. 
The piloting of Captain Peter Killian, American Airlines, in March 1953, and the resulting official investigation of this "sighting" as a "UFO" phenomenon, was a classic case of intelligent reporting. Captain Killian, a senior pilot, and observer, reported sighting a strange aerial object while flying over the eastern United States. This case has been a landmark in the investigation of UFO reports made by competent observers.
