**DATE OF REPORT**
6 August 1952

**EVALUATION**

**In accordance with AFI 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title: FLYOBRPT), the following report of unident-
ified flying objects is submitted:**

On 3rd August 1952 at 2220 MST, Mr. --------------------, Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, observed a formation of orange lights apparently hovering in the sky. The objects were about 45° above the horizon and appeared within the line of sight leading to the Big Dipper handle. The observer was located in the south edge of Truth or Consequences, leading west of north.

The objects made an intricate change in formation, and then, seemed to ascend at a rapid rate until out of sight.

The observer, assuming size of objects to be equal to a jet fighter, estimated the position of objects to be 6 or 7 miles away. (This would place objects overhead the Truth or Consequences Airport which has a rotating light or beacon.

The time of observation was approximately 9 minutes.

**The reliability of the observer is considered good.**

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM (Unit)

PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES
34th Air Division (Def)
/ / A

(1) Shape: Elliptical
Size: In length they were about two (2) widths of observer's little
finger, viewed at arms length. The width was about equal to
the width of 1/8" diameter wire held at arms length.
Color: Light green or like tinted white, no glow.
Number: Three
Maneuvers: Horizontal Inverted V
Formation: One object, first appearing circular, turned 180° on its
axis, so as to appear elliptical, then moved up and over
the other two objects to a lower position in the forma-
tion. This position was held for a short time and the
highest object ( the original spot of the inverted "V")
appeared to turn on its axis 180°, changing from circu-
lar to elliptical, then ascended rapidly, fading from
view. The remaining two (2) objects turned in a like
manner, and followed the first ascending object. The ob-
server counted to twenty-nine (29) (approximately 29 sec-
onds) during the time the first object ascended and the
last one moved to follow.
Manner of Disappearance: Objects went straight up until they could
no longer be seen.
Other unusual Features: Only one side of each object seemed to be
irradiant.

SHORT STATEMENT

I, _________, do hereby make the following statement:

On Sunday night Aug. 3rd 1952 at about 10:20 to 10:29 P.M. saw over and to the northwest of the city Truth or Consequences, New Mexico three objects or lights that to me seemed peculiar and not of a type that my logic could intelligently explain. On & off they were suspended in the sky in the area above the Big Dipper handle at tree length they were about one to 2 widths of my little finger in length, and their width would be about the same as a wood match or 1/8" diameter wire held at arms length. As soon they appeared motionless or perhaps travelling directly towards me however, their speed & motion - 
their formation looked to me as follows:

After holding this position for some time (1) became elliptical and did 180 degree path like to a hyperbole or spiral sliding position (4). This position was held for some time and (2) showed elliptical and then it and each travelled straightly upwards. Too and (2) went through same maneuvers as (2) with the exception it revolved 180° counter clockwise and travelled after the first one (2). Then no. (3) turned paralle pie to full circle, back to elliptical and followed (2) and (4). This was observed from the roof of my house at 815 Charles Street where I had gone to recover a hammer left there in the daytime. The color of this light was green or like tinted white. No glow, slightly solid color. All movements were graceful and seemed fully controlled, but swift and sudden like something travelling at high speeds. I am now director of truth or consequences Airport and did this report to operator in charge, arriving at about10:50 P.M. I operated as Mining Engineer for Anaconda Copper Mining Co. from 1923 to 1945 most time being spent in foreign country Ohio, SoLa. taking the biggest part of that time. I worked as engineer 1946 in Helena National Forests. From 1946 to 1948 I was Engineer for American Smelting and Refining stationed at Mah Dahab and Jeddah Saudi Arabia. From 1948 to 1950, I was Forester for the Lewis and Clark Forrest at Great Falls, Montana.
