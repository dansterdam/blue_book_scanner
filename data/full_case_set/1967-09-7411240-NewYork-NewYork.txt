Department of the Air Force
Headquarters Foreign Technology Division (AFSC)
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Colonel Manatt:

With reference to your memorandum of October 10, 1967 forwarded this office by Mr. Edward Ingemann, you indicated that at the time in question, 0220Z, September 9, 1967, without further research we can advise that the view of the favorable weather of that date, the normal air traffic generated by the four Metropolitan-area airports (LaGuardia, Kennedy, Newark, and Teterboro) would have incorporated the simultaneous airborne on approach or departure to these airports and either over or visible from the Queens, New York area.

Hence, it would be impossible for us to ascertain not only as of this date, but even as it occurred, that the observed "bright white light" was not an aircraft. In any event, even had identification as a UFO been possible, the object obviously chose the least course, departing an already crowded airspace within thirty seconds after arrival.

Sincerely,

B. D. McKenzie
Acting Chief, LaGuardia Tower

Dear Anyone,
On September 7, 1967, while in Van Cortlandt Park at 9:05, I saw a UFO. It was traveling at 500 feet (estimate) above the ground, in a NE direction. I observed this UFO and there passed it had a four light arrangement, the fourth light came on every second.
We could easily discern the metal between the four lights and this other thing reminded me of what I've seen in movies. This was reported to the BASE.
The UFO Then put on a burst of speed, disappearing in the N-SE direction, at TOP SPEED falling the object. The UFO Then put on a burst of speed, disappearing in the N-SE direction, at TOP SPEED falling the object.
A few seconds later another person came over to our bench. He then screamed "I saw up there!" We were followed where the man pointing and saw the same UFO preceding 1/2 miles the Hustler following it. He was not here the first time.
(Remainder of text is unclear due to redaction, but it appears to describe additional details about the sighting)
