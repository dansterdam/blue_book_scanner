Dear Sir:

At 4:30 on May 1st, an object was sighted about 120 degrees above the horizon. It at first appeared to be a star, but then started moving across the sky and blinking. It covered the distance to the horizon in about a minute. It was sighted in Sabatus, Maine. The following is a diagram of its path from its stationary point. Please advise as to what this object is.
