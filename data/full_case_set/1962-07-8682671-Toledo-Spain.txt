15 July 1962

Gentlemen:
Last night, on the 15th of this month, at about 10 o'clock, when I was with my children, I saw what seemed to me to be a satellite in the sky. I was coming home with my children, and as I was crossing a field, I saw this object, which had a bluish-white light. I called to my children to come and see it, and they also saw it. We watched it for 15 minutes, and it did not move from the spot where we first saw it. There were no flashing lights, and it seemed to be stationary in the sky. After 15 minutes, it disappeared suddenly, as if it had been turned off. I have been wondering about this ever since, and I would like to have your opinion on what this object could have been. It may or may not have been the satellite you spoke of, but we actually saw something unusual that night.
Very truly yours,
[Signature Redacted]

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Your letter of July 16, 1962 to Cape Canaveral has been referred to this office. I agree that your description of the delay in reporting your sighting before finally reaching the office of primary interest.

Our records indicate that Echo I, which is 100 feet in diameter, was moving northbound about 17 miles north of Madrid moving in a southeasterly direction at 17 minutes after midnight on 13 July, 1962. It should have been at an elevation of 32 degrees, which would put it in the line of sight you have indicated with reference to Uranus Majorus. 

May we express our appreciation for your interest and promptness in reporting your sighting.

Sincerely,

W. J. LOCKADOO
Public Information Div

1. Reference the attached letter from [redacted] requesting information on unidentified flying objects. This letter forwarded to your office for whatever action you deem necessary.

2. Echo I is still in orbit. At 00.17 on 13 July 1962, Echo I was 1076 degrees in elevation, north of Madrid moving southeast. It is possible that this echo was witnessed by Mr. [redacted] and his children as it passed over just before midnight on 23 July 1962; the rocket body fell to Earth on 28 July 1962, disintegrating at about 57 miles altitude. The above information is in reporting the object.
