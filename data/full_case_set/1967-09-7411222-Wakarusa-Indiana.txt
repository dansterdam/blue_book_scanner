The image provided does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. The text appears to be a document or report, potentially related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR system would output it:

"Sept 19 - 67

Thursday nite Sept 7-22 - Between 9:25 & 10 F.S.T.
Lewis Belue, 54, (sic) farmer, 
apparently observed a strange object in the sky
near a woodlot north of Wakarusa, Indiana.
He called state police and the object was soon
sighted by others. It was described as a
bright, elongated object, moving rapidly 
at first, then slowing down. It changed
direction a number of times and at
intervals put on bursts of speed.
The light was reported to be so bright
that it could be seen through the cloud cover.
Belue said the object appeared to land 
in a field about 1/2 mile from his home.
He drove to the field but could find 
no physical evidence of a landing.
It was not seen again after 
about 10:25 P.M.

The Deputy Sheriff and other officers
who saw the object stated that it was
not an aircraft, military or civilian, 
nor could it be a meteor or satellite. 
The witness said the object 'could not be 
the USAF or some other nations' aircraft'."
