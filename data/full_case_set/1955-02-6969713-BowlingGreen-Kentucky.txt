It appears to be a "PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD" from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The card provides details about a UFO sighting, including the date, location, type of observation, number and description of objects, duration of observation, and conclusions.
