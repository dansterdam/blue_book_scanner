The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a Project 10073 Record Card from the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, which was an investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The record card contains information about a UFO sighting that occurred in Los Angeles, California on 12 Sep 60. The card includes details such as the date, location, type of sighting (Ground-Visual), sources, number of objects, and a brief summary of the sighting.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with text content only.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the curve, a "B" at the end of the curve, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object you saw.

The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line in the sky with rays or beams extending from it, likely depicting a UFO sighting. The second sketch shows a road or path with trees or foliage on the sides, likely depicting a UFO sighting from the ground. The third sketch shows a silhouetted figure standing on a hill or mountain against a cloudy sky, also likely depicting a UFO sighting.

37. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Please on a 8"x11" outline paper use a pencil to draw how high the object moved across the sky (skyline) and how long of a trail it left. This will help us to determine the size and speed. NOTE: Use the time given for the sighting as a guide.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and an "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete this larger sketch.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

On August 22, 1960, a letter was received from XXXXX XXX of Los Angeles, California, describing his sighting of an unidentified flying object on August 13, 1960. The letter stated:

"On August 13, 1960, at approximately 8:30 p.m., I was looking out my window toward the southwest sky. I observed a dark object in the sky, roughly the shape and size of a cigar. It was stationary for about 2 minutes, then began to move slowly in a northwesterly direction. After moving for about 30 seconds, it suddenly increased its speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds.

The object was a dark color and appeared to be about the size of a quarter held at arm's length. It was not blinking or flashing any lights. I have no idea what this object was, but it was definitely not an airplane, satellite, or any other known aircraft. I would like to know if there were any other reports of this same object in the Los Angeles area on that date."

The letter was forwarded to Project Blue Book for analysis and investigation.
