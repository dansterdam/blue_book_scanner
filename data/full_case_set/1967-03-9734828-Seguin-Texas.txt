IF OBJECTS WERE WEAVING IN AND OUT OF CLOUDS THEY WOULD PAGE 3 RUNTFJA3053 UNCLAS HAVE HAD TO BE AT OR GREATER THAN AN ALTITUDE OF 20,000 FT. EITHER OF ABOVE STATED CONDITIONS MAY BE EXPLAINED AS CHAFFREFLE CTING IN SUN. CHAFF IS OFTEN DROPPED BY AF ACFT IN THIS AREA. LOCAL RADAR CONTROLLERS STATE THAT CHAFF IS DISCERNIBLE ON THEIR RADAR SCOPES FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME (40 MINS TO HOUR) WHEN UPPER WINDS ARE LIGHT IN INTENSITY. A CHAFF DROP WAS MADE OVER JUNCTION, TEX ABOUT 100 MILES WEST NORTHWEST AT 24,000 FT. THIS DROP MAY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE ALTHOUGH UPPEA IR WINDS REPORTED AT THAT TIME DO NOT SUPPORT THIS CONCLUSION.
