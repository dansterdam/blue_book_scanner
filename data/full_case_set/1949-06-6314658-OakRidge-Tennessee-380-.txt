SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

  On 22 June 1949, Officials of the OSI, Knoxville, Tennessee, informed
this Agent that on Sunday, 19 June 1949, at 1200 hours, a "flying saucer" was sighted 
at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The "flying saucer", consisting of three objects, was
sighted at approximately 1000 ft. altitude proceeding from the southeast in a north-
westerly direction by Mr._. Mrs._a school teacher at Oak Ridge, was 
aboard Oak Ridge, Tennessee, from their yard. After Watching the "flying saucer" for,
about five minutes, Mrs._, a school teacher at Oak Ridge, notified Mrs._,
_ wife of a member of the Security Division, AEC,_ and Mr._Oak
Ridge, whose backyard is adjacent to that of Mrs._. Together these three 
people observed the "flying saucer" for about twelve to fifteen minutes until it
disappeared, It was described as consisting of two identical rectangular-shaped
objects which appeared to be coordinated in movement and which moved in a wave-like
motion. The third object was circular in shape and appeared to be in level flight
between and above the two rectangular objects. The rectangular objects appeared to
be bright metal on top but dark underneath, while the color of the circular object 
was the same as that of frosted glass. The "flying saucer", when last sighted,
was in level flight and was flying in a northwesterly direction. The weather was
clear with high cumulus clouds. The "flying saucer" flew at a speed of from 10 to
15 mph over an area just about the center of Oak Ridge. The Weather Section of 
Plant X-10 reported that they did not release any weather balloons or any other
meteorological instruments on that day. The Weather Bureau at Knoxville Airport
reported having released a weather balloon at 1005 but no meteorological equipment.
Their balloon was followed by sighting instruments until it had reached an altitude 
of 15300 meters and was last sighted at 6300 meters moving in a south-southwesterly
direction at 196 degrees, after having been released twenty-three minutes. Weather
charts at Knoxville Airport showing the wind at Oak Ridge to be at a speed of 4 to 7
mph up to an altitude of 2000 ft. in an easterly direction. The surface winds at
Knoxville Airport were at a speed of 3 meters per second at fifty degrees; at 1000
ft., 3 meters per second at 80 degrees; at 2000 ft, 6 meters per second at 120
degrees.                                                                J(B-2)

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
AT OAK RIDGE TENNESSEE; At 1900 hours, 20 June 1949, Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED]
of [REDACTED], Oakridge, Tennessee, stated that at approximately
1200 hours, 19 June 1949, they sighted three unidentified objects flying

the objects and called Mr. [REDACTED]’s attention to them. They watched the
objects until they came into closer view. They described two of the objects
as being rectangular in shape, and identical. The third object was described
as cylindrical in shape, and flying either in between or slightly above the two

flexible. The third object was flat but did not have a flexible appearance.
The rectangular objects in traveling, followed a wave-like course, and
appeared to be dark in color underneath, and of bright metal finish on top.
The movements were coordinated, and the ir reflection in traveling was
light and darke. The rectangular objects seemed to have an area of from four
to ten square feet. The circular object was described as being the color of
frosted glass. This third object did not follow the wave-like movement of
the rectangular objects, but maintained a level flight. There was no noise
