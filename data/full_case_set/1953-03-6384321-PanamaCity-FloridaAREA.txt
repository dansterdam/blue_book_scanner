At this time, A/2C Teeple and a companion were en route to the Officers' Club. A/2C Teeple and his companion proceeded to the location from where the call originated, and Teeple reported that he observed the object described by the woman caller. He stated that he watched the object for approximately 15 minutes, and that it was moving at a high rate of speed and seemed to be circling over the area. He further reported that the object seemed to glow and that it then disappeared from sight.

"b. The Director of Intelligence might dispatch Records for 25 March 1953 - 2135: Aircraft 52-1901 (Call sign 97-10) was airborne from 2200 to 2250 (Visual flight only). Notified CIC when OBJECT was sighted a 2135."

Mrs. was the only one who reported this event, and her observation was made from inside her house looking out the window. Since the object was quite far away, it could not determine the distance or the altitude.

COMMENT BY THE PREPARING OFFICER: Since there were a minimum of thirty (30) jet aircraft airborne in the general vicinity of Panama City at the time of the observation, this object could have been the reflection of a jet for observer stated that possibility.

25 March 1952

SUBJECT: Flying Saucers

On Wednesday, 25 March 1952, at about 3:00 o'clock (Central Standard Time) I observed an object in the sky at a distance which I could not determine, but the object was flying straight and level from Green toward Panama City, Florida. I first sighted the object while sitting in a chair looking out the window. It was shining in the window, but was not spinning. When I looked at it so that the object was not blinding in the window, I could see that the object appeared to be disc-shaped and was definitely of a greater size than a star or any other flying object I have seen. It held a steady course in the sky for about three (3) seconds, and then rushed to the front door in an attempt to get a better look, but the object had disappeared. It could have been possibly a very fast jet aircraft.
