Unidentified Flying Object (Rhodesia)

1. Reference attached telegram #335 from the American Consulate General, Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia.

2. The information is very limited, therefore, no positive conclusion can be made concerning 16 June 60, the sighting of the Aeronatics Techniques Center that this object is believed responsible for this sighting was a very bright light.

3. It is described as a light, as bright or brighter than 3-5 magnitude stars, changing in brightness and color, which may represent various maneuvers or color changes. Sometimes the light is left which may also be noticed, or may change color after being near-stationary, when seen in the daytime. Flames and sparks have sometimes been reported with these objects. A good portion of the duration of the sighting is occupied with pulsing, fluttering or whirling noise may be associated with them. A good percentage of these objects burst and disappear in a brilliant display, when these meteors are heard or seen to explode they are then identified.

4. The speed reported in the referenced message is far below that of any known conventional aircraft, therefore this may be due to the illusions of the observers.

5. If a more comprehensive study of this case is desirable, it is suggested that the following information be forwarded to ARDC:
a. Names and/or positions of all witnesses.
b. Duration of sighting.
c. Describing features as time or lighting.
d. Apparent brightness of object.
e. How object disappeared.
f. Did object leave a trail or have a tail?
