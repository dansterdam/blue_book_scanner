BIRMINGHAM POST-HERALD
27 SEP 50
Flying Saucer 
With Us Again,
Over Theater
Another flying saucer - or something - showed up over Bessemer last night, according to Aubrey Yates, Jefferson County deputy sheriff.
Mr. Yates, who lives at 6616 Ave. N, Midway the movie, he looked up, and there, he said, was a cigarlike object gliding along slowly. It had a luminous glow with a kind of soft slow glitter. Then all at once, the thing disappeared in about three seconds, he said. 
At the same time, the U. S. Weather Bureau said it had received several calls describing the object - about the size of an auto tire, yellow or orange in color and gliding silently.
The deputy was sure it wasn't the steel mills, because a cloud passed between the object and the mills, blotting it out. 
"It wasn't any kind of airplane, that whatever it was, it scared hell out of me," the deputy said.
