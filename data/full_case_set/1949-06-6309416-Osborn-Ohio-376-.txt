   a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size of target:
      
   b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (180°), etc., and what radius of turn. If radius of turn was not observable, how long did the target stay in the turn and what was its speed?

   c. Note particularly any separation of distant targets into several targets upon approach:

   d. Was radar blip on cathode ray tube well defined and consistent with size of object; faint; fading; pulsating at regular rate:

   e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?

2. If airborne, when object was sighted
