24 October 1952
Concord, California

October 24, 1953 - Concord, California
Today at about 11:42 AM we observed a phenomenon that we should very much like to have explained:
It was a clear, sunny day, and we spotted several hundred (one estimate says 2000) small, snow-white, gleaming objects, floating and tumbling along on the breeze. Some were as high as the sky, others just a few feet above the ground, and three settled in our garden, one about 4 feet by 3 feet, another about 10 feet by 3 or 4 feet, and the third quite small, about 1 or 2 feet. These looked like some sort of foam, almost like a dense cellulose that was shiny or waxy in appearance. They were very delicate, and began to disintegrate to the touch, and it became apparent that the substances completely disappeared, but we saw they were shiny white, consisting of tiny foamy cells.
While examining these, a huge mass of foam, some floating and tumbling about 20 feet up, suddenly began to disappear, and in a little while all had vanished.

LUBBOCK LIGHTS REPORT

"There have been numerous sightings of formations of "lights" in this area and over a relatively short period of time. In every instance each sighting was observed by two or more Air Force Weather Observers. The first sightings by accident, those following scheduled by the crews themselves."

Sightings: 1. 3 Oct 53, Central Standard Time): Formation passing N to S, five to seven lights (or glow- ing discs) shining with a dull white glow. Passed from approx. E to W in two or three seconds. At a high or at least 15,000 ft. Second sighting: 2030 (approx).

Groups, no formation or number discernible, moving N to S one at about twenty degrees and the other at about 30 degrees high in the western quadrant. No heights ventured except the first group was higher yet closer to our observers. The second group passed on out of sight after several minutes.

Third sighting: 2305 (approx) One group of six or seven lights in western quadrant, high and moving fast. In view about three to five seconds.

Time: 2110, 31 Oct 53. 
Sighted large "y" formation from the NW veering to ENE, overhead, height not discernible by observer.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document excerpt describing a "Second sighting: 2112 (approx.)" of some kind of phenomenon. The text discusses the details of this sighting, including the appearance of "very dull white lights" and the observer's analysis of the event. The text does not identify any individuals and focuses on describing the observed phenomenon.

Second sighting: 2112 (approx.): Sighted largest portion yet, since about twelve glowing discs or lights of very dull white lights. Low on west horizon, computed not to be over eight and apparently still farther from the observer than the first sighting. There does not seem to be squeezed by the effects of perspective. It seems that if this was the case then each light would be the same size. Instead the formation made the world seem to be flattened. This of course is a presumption but is based on what we saw. 

Since these sightings the Observers of the weather station have been conferring and believe their were atmospheric phenomena though irregular in form. These are all the sightings they have observed to date.

I would like to point out that all sightings including the latest heterodyne observations made by one of the observers with Atmospheric Phenomena All but one (the sightings on 22 Oct 23 as 2002) which is not reported in this letter, were definite sightings and no questions as to confusion with natural phenomena is brought up.
