Being interested in flying saucers and having read a good bit on the subject, I am quite familiar with the general descriptions and classifications of UFO observations. This object, however, did not seem to fit any of the usual classifications - it was simply unlike anything I had ever seen before, either in person or in photos. It seemed to be a kind of glowing, reddish or orange light somewhat disc-shaped, but without distinct edges. It appeared to be self-luminous and was rapidly moving across the sky, at an estimated altitude of between 1,000 and 2,000 feet. The size appeared to be roughly that of a full moon, but it was much brighter and more intense. The duration of the observation was only a matter of seconds, perhaps 10-15 seconds at the most. From the time it first came into view until it disappeared from sight, it maintained a constant speed and course, and did not seem to change direction or altitude. I was so struck by the unusual nature of the object that I called the attention of several other persons to it at the time, but they did not seem to see it or grasp what I was pointing out. I have never before or since that time seen an object that could be so clearly described as a "flying saucer" as this one appeared to be. There was no sound associated with the object, and no trail or exhaust was visible. The night was clear, with good visibility.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? To no one

The image does not contain any photographs or visual elements. It appears to be a page from an official U.S. Air Force document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying object (UFO) reports.

Text from the document:

34. Have you completed this questionnaire? 20 June 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The witness described the object that was observed as going very swiftly across the sky in an easterly direction. The object appeared to be oval-shaped and gave off a bright light. The witness feels that some comparison was made to the object by another witness saying it was similar to a fluorescent light, but the witness does not recall the details of this comparison clearly. The witness may have also mentioned that the object appeared to be about the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length, but is not certain of this detail.
