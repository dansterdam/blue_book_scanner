Dear sir:

On January 13, 1964, at approximately 4:55 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, a light was observed over the Gainesville, Florida area. The light was silvery in color and appeared to be somewhat rounded in shape. It was estimated to be about 400 feet in diameter and was descending and moving in an easterly direction. The light remained visible for approximately 15 to 20 seconds before it disappeared. It made no sound and left no trail. The light was observed by a number of people in the area, including several university professors and staff members. Their observations were consistent with the details provided above.

We would appreciate your assistance in determining the nature of this observation. If any further information is required, please let me know.

Sincerely,

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (70 miles West of Jacksonville, Florida)

1. The following information is provided to assist you in a reply to Mr. ------- , University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. Our records indicate no previous correspondence on this case.

2. The object reported had a southwesterly component, rolling out and shown a pulsation. The duration of the observation is not excessive for an aircraft at high altitude, particularly since he has indicated that it appeared the object was not just an aircraft out of its normal flight pattern. These are no high altitude air routes over this area, and it would not be on a regular schedule. However, this does not rule out aircraft.

Text output:

February 20, 1964

Dear Mr. Weiss:

This is in response to your letter of January 23, in which you reported observing an unidentified flying object.

Since this object had a southwesterly component, it would not seem to have been a known astronomical object. Although there are no high altitude aircraft over your area capable of producing such a sighting, the observation does not appear to have been of an aircraft. It was not on a regular schedule, nor was it on any other regular flight pattern. It was traveling at a speed higher than usual for known aircraft.

Enclosed is a brochure concerning the Air Force program on unidentified flying objects which may be of interest to you.

Thank you for reporting this observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

MARION M. JACKS
