6. Misawa RAPCON officers could discern no special pattern in the unidentified targets. They were not always on the Misawa runway (or possibly toward the NW as indicated in the details). The targets did not converge in any identifiable manner.
From the general description, the tracks are what might be expected from normal aircraft operations (i.e. approaching, landing, etc.) No positive identification was made of the type of equipment at Misawa. However, investigation to date has not disclosed any information which might clearly indicate the identity or nature of the targets.
6. (C) In addition to the incidents on 10, 11, and 12 April described above, the same type of targets were observed on 14 April. The targets were seen on eight occasions on that date; they were erratic and irregular rather than in any consistent pattern, and in one instance, two were present.
7. (U) Any additional data which might clearly indicate the identity or nature of the targets will be forwarded if it becomes available.

TECHNICAL EVALUATION OF THE MISAWA AB, JAPAN, UFO REPORT INDICATES THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE WAS ANOMALOUS PROPAGATION. RADAR ECHOES OBTAINED FROM BIRDS, INSECTS AND METEOROLOGICAL EFFECTS. IN THIS INSTANCE NO TANGIBLE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS ANOMALOUS PROPAGATION.

SIGHTINGS ON APRIL 10*

AT APPROXIMATELY 21130Z, TRAP 02, A T-39 WAS ON BEAM 136 DEGREES APPROXIMATELY 6 MILES OUT. AT THIS TIME TS OBSERVER A TARGET WENT OFF THE FAR SCAN. FAA TRAP 02 CAME ON IN, ANOTHER TARGET TRAP 02 ALSO STARTED ORBITING. AT 21132Z, TRAP 02 IT STOPPED ORBITING AND WENT OFF THE SCREEN AND PASSED OFF THE LEFT WING. ANOTHER TARGET CAME IN FROM THE EAST AND PASSED VERY CLOSE TO THE AIRCRAFT, ESTIMATED AT 1/2 MILE OUT ON FINAL APPROACH, AND ANOTHER TARGET CAME FROM THE WEST ABOUT 1-1/2 MILES AND PASSED ABOUT 500 FEET ABOVE. AT THIS INITIAL SIGHTING, THE AIRCRAFT WAS BEING VECTORED FOR PRECISION FINAL APPROACH ON A COLLISION COURSE AND PASSED DIRECTLY OVER TR 02, APPEARED BE A LARGE BALLOON OR SOMETHING SIMILAR ABOUT 500 FEET LONG. PILOT OF TRAP 02, CAPT CALLA, AND ANOTHER OFFICER CAME TO THE TOWER AND REPORTED WHAT THEY HAD SEEN. THEY STATED THAT WHEN THEY FIRST OBSERVED THE TARGET, IT APPEARED TO BE A LARGE OBJECT ABOUT 500 FEET LONG. IT HAD TAKEN EVASIVE ACTION WHEN THEY STARTED TO CLOSE ON IT. THEY STATED THEIR AIRCRAFT WAS ON FAR AND ASK. ALSO THE THREE ABOVE MENTIONED TARGETS HERE OBSERVED AND DESCRIBED AS UNIDENTIFIED. THIS AIRCRAFT, T-39, WAS UNDER GCI CONTROL OF TRAPOD AND VECTORED IN ALL THIS TIME. THE GCI OPERATOR STATED HE COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE TARGETS ON HIS SCOPE. IT WAS NOTED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THAT THE WEATHER IN THIS AREA WAS CLEAR, AND ALTHOUGH THE TRAPTARD SITE DID HAVE SOME MINOR EQUIPMENT TROUBLE, IT WAS IN FULL OPERATING CONDITION AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. NO FURTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE.

UNCLASSIFIED

In the past 12 years I have had opportunities to observe a variety of phenomena - unexplained inversion, false returns, birds - and numerous other objects but never a single case moving with the speed and direction indicated by the signed and dated report.

NOTE: These are statements by RAPCON radar scope observers taken by DAVID M. VAUGHAN, Chief, Target Intelligence Branch, 5th USAF.

SIGHTINGS ON APRIL 11:
11 April 1965, approximately 21:40 local, I observed targets visually on the scopes and radar appeared on the range at distances of 5 and 6 miles from the base. These targets were observed moving at various speeds and altitudes but always in a north-south direction. All appeared to be single returns.
The total number of targets was 9 on AST and 1 on PAR. The time span was from approximately 21:40 local to 22:57 local. The targets elevation and altitude remained constant at approximately 6 miles out from the course. There was no reported action taken on these unknown objects.

Witnesses:
TSgt Sawitz 
A/3C Jackson 
A/2C Woody
A1C Rupert (Radar Maint)

Tower could not see any visible targets when given bearings.

NOTE: These are statements by RAPCON radar scope observers during an Air Force installation branch.

DETACHMENT 4 (PACIFIC OFFICE)
FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY DIVISION
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO

4 MAY 1965

THRU: Hq FSTC (TDEW)
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO 45433

TO: Hq FSTD (TDEW)
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO 45433

1. (S) Reference is made to UFO Report dated 10 April 1965, concerning an incident observed 10 April 1965 at Misawa AB, Japan, by GCA radar and an individual who observed the incidents.

2. (S) The objects were observed on both GPN-18 (S-band) and FPS-6 (C-band) GCA radars when the objects were in position to be observed. The radar returns appeared to be caused by definite targets rather than main lobe clutter. At times, the targets seemed unlikely to be real aircraft. The objects were electronically generated rather than being caused by weather phenomena. The targets remained stationary for long periods of time, up to 30 minutes, and then would accelerate to high speeds, reaching speeds in excess of 1,000 knots. Turns and maneuvers were abrupt and varied.

3. (U) According to the unidentified observer, the targets most often were irregular in shape, resembling saucers, and varied in size. Diameters were estimated to be from 30 to 50 feet. The targets did not always give identical radar returns from observation to observation, indicating that they may have varied in shape or their reflective qualities from one view to the next. The observed acceleration rates to high speeds, abrupt maneuvers, and disappearance at high altitudes were considered unusual. Atmospheric conditions during the entire period of observation were clear and no weather was present which could be attributed as the cause of the radar targets.

4. (U) The radar observations and visual sightings by the unidentified observer are not considered unusual; however, the high speed, abrupt maneuverability and disappearance at high altitudes are not typical of known aircraft. This incident indicates the possibility of some unusual aerial phenomenon in the area of Misawa AB, Japan on that date.

5. (U) Action to be taken: None. This report is forwarded for information purposes only.
