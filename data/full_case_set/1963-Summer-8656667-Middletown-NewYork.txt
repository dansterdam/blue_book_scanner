Dear Sirs:
I read an article in the Medical Tribune which says you are still interested in flying objects in the sky.
I would like to tell you what I saw. About 2 years ago I saw a whole formation of bright starlike objects in the sky. They were about the size of a pin head and they were moving across the sky like a carpet of stars and in the northwest near the horizon I saw what looked like a huge mother ship, it was bigger than any of the stars and were darting in all directions. Watched for about 30 seconds and then they all darted into a formation like this-
They were perfectly spaced in this formation and seemed to be in this position for I should say about 2 minutes and then out of sight at a tremendous speed, they were all out of sight in just a few seconds, I am not at all a religious mystic and I don't care who knows it. All this I saw very plainly, about 9:30 or 10 o'clock at night.
Yours truly,
Box 337

REFERENCE the attached letter from requesting
information on an unidentified flying object which she observed
about two years ago. The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear Mrs. 

Your observation of about two years ago is, of course, 
too old to warrant an investigation. The sighting in itself is 
very interesting and perhaps could become identified as a known
object under the expanded Blue Book program.
