TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

G. Case Narrative Report: Northridge Ohio UFO - Received at ATIC 7 July 1962

On July 7, 1962, Mrs. C.G. reported seeing an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky over her residence in Northridge, Ohio, at approximately 9:20 p.m. (EDT). She stated that the object was first noticed in the southern sky, and that it appeared to be at a very high altitude. The object was described as being brilliant white in color, circular in shape, and approximately the size of a basketball at arm's length. It was reported to be hovering or stationary in the sky for approximately two to three minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared to the north at a very high rate of speed.

Mrs. C.G. further stated that the object made no sound and that there were no other witnesses to the sighting. This case is considered an UNIDENTIFIED due to lack of additional evidence or sightings to confirm the report.

The image does not contain any photographs, but rather consists of two diagrams. The top diagram appears to be a compass or directional diagram, with the cardinal directions labeled. The bottom diagram shows a landscape scene with a figure standing in the foreground, and what appears to be a cloud or unidentified aerial phenomenon in the distance.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:
