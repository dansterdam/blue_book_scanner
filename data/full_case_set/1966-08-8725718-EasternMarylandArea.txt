Saucer-shaped object, white or silvery, watching the ground. It appeared to zig-zag and disappear and reappear. The object moved in an erratic manner, often stopping in flight. It seemed to have a special attraction or interest in the area, as I watched it for an extended period of time, passing overhead and maneuvering around at low altitudes. At one point a second object appeared, which also maneuvered in the same erratic fashion as the first. Both objects seemed to have some kind of bluish-green glow around their perimeter. I was not in any danger, but was fascinated by this display and observed it for a long time until it disappeared from sight.

MEMO For the Record
1 August 66
In regards to the Eastern Maryland Area sightings the fol comments are offered:
At approximately 0230 EDT
Capella 45° Az & 18° Elevation
Aldebaran 72° Az & 8° Elevation
At approximately 0500 EDT
Stars Capella 58° Az 40° El
Aldebaran 20° Az 33° El
Betelgeuse 34° Az 8° El
Planets Jupiter 63° Az 6° El
Mars 50° Az 32° El
According to the Smithsonian Institute tracking serv various satellites were due to be visible at 0416, 0542, 0702, and 0742. The normal 'glow' over the eastern horizon should have been visible at approximately 0442.
Since no definite shapes were observed by any of the witnesses, the only clues are the positions of the various stars and planets and satellites that were visible. It is a difficult matter to evaluate the observations, since there were no radar returns or definite shapes that could be interpreted as a physical object. There were no unusual readings on the various electronic instruments, and Jupiter and Venus were unusually bright, morning sky and should have distinctly been observed.
