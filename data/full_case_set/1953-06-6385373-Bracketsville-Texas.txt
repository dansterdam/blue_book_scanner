SUMMARY: Center covers resumary of report. Other significance to place in present paragraph. The enclosure enclosed is folder left. Single line of report on AP Form 112-Part 273.

This report covers the sightings of UFOs (unidentified flying objects) over Brackatsville, Texas, during the period 21 to 27 March 1952. 
On several occasions during this period, a group of military personnel stationed nearby observed small, high speed objects maneuvering in the sky over the area. The objects were described as sharply defined against the sky, capable of extreme speed and rapid changes in direction, and frequently disappearing from view and reappearing in another location.

On the occasion of 23 March, an object was seen at approximately 1920 hours which appeared to be trailing sparks or fire particles. The object approached the observers at high speed, and then abruptly stopped, hovered momentarily, and then accelerated away at tremendous speed.

The observers, all of whom are thoroughly reliable and experienced in observing aircraft, are convinced that the objects seen could not have been conventional aircraft. The extraordinary performance characteristics exhibited, especially the ability to suddenly stop and accelerate at such tremendous speeds, would appear to rule out the possibility of the objects being either aircraft or meteorological phenomena.
