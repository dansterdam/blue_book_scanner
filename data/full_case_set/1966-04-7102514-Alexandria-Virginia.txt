Gentlemen:

On the morning of 15 April 1966 at 5:00 A. M. I noted through my picture window a bright shining object in the sky which I will attempt to describe. It appeared to be disc shaped, very bright, larger in size and brilliance than the moon and cloaked in a hazy atmosphere. It was hovering in a stationary position for several minutes. (Upon seeing this, I awakened my spouse also to this phenomenon.) After about 13 by government time, the object changed shapes, but still appeared in an almost stationary position. It was then moving slowly upward and at a slight angle to the East. We watched the object move completely out of sight in a manner which appeared to be a staged effort of long duration. There was no noise, no trail, no different colors as generally seen with normal aircraft.

I worked for the Director of Intelligence, 9th Air Force from 1956 to 1958 and have typed some of these reports but never thought I would see such phenomenon myself. However, I felt it my duty to pass it on for whatever it might mean to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
(Mrs.)

Encl.
