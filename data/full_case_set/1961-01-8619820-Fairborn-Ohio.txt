The following, extracted from 1/Lt Shannon's report dated 11 Jan 61, is quoted for your information:

1920 hours received a call from the POD, Maj H. Scarborough, who reported that Maj W. Rosen saw a bright object described as a disc-shaped or cylinder-shaped object, larger than a conventional aircraft, traveling at a high rate of speed at an elevation of over 45 degrees. I did not contact Maj Rosen.
