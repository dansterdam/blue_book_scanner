13 March 1960

Dear Mrs. [Redacted],

Your letter of 15 February 1960 addressed to the U.S. Army has been referred to this office.

The probable cause of the sounds you experienced is sonic booms and the unusual configuration of the area where you live is fully and amply illustrated by the sound and echoes could continue to visit you heard.

The 1935 sighting you describe was probably caused by light reflected from the dome of the Lick Observatory.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER

UFO INITIAL (Case 60-0032)

1. It is the opinion of ATIC that this has been further checked by the witness' insistence that the object is not known, but is highly possibly complyin with the normal USAF color formations from just aircraft.

2. It is impossible to determine positively what the witness saw. The object was almost certainly misidentified and is probably complyin with the normal USAF color formations from just aircraft.

3. The witness' sketch indicates that this is probably military satellite.

The information has been forwarded to AOIN-J1 to be used as a basis for USAF analysis.

The image contains a photograph of a landscape with a caption describing a "Sonic Boom Heard In Valley". The caption states that a "cracking sonic boom" was heard by residents in the valley, and a report was telephoned to the Air Force indicating the sound traveled along a path from Altamont to San Jose along the eastern foothills. No other visual elements are present in the photograph.

Sonic Boom  
Heard In Valley

A cracking sonic boom  
was heard by residents in  
the central and eastern  
part of the Santa Clara  
Valley, according to re-  
ports telephoned to the  
AF. The sonic boom ap-  
peared to travel along a  
path from Altamont,

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter dated February 15, 1960, addressed to "Army Field Command" from someone in San Jose, California. The letter describes an incident that occurred on February 15, 1960 at 4 o'clock in the East Foothills of San Jose, where the writer observed what they describe as a "jet-like object" hovering over the hills. The writer asks the recipient to "look into these facts" regarding this incident.

Feb 15, 1950

Army Field Command:

Dear Sir:

I'm writing this letter in hopes that someone with an agency of intelligence will take to what I have to say - They saw 1k2, 1950 at 4 o'clock in the East Foot hills of San Jose, two of your jets passed over head, and also the months that have passed over head something lying up there breaks out with great force and follows the jets.

I know the sound of a jet, but this is a different kind of sound. It is as though it is less in wait between the start and high of the notes. Its motor stops and then goes again as though it can stay in one place and that is in hard to decide to describe it.

It followed the two jets quite at 4 o'clock feb 15, 1950.

Enclosed is an article in the paper about an sonic boom. I was in the yard and looking over head I could hear this strange noise. to I thought that may be body was braking out with some strange waste so my body felt like it was coming out of my skin. I went to the hospital about 4 AM - the doctors couldn't described it as like all doctors they called to give me a sedative.

In 1955 at 3 A.M in the morning hanging over in the Foot hills we could see this object bright hovering back & forth in the hills, swinging like pendulums on an clock. I called my husband; then he called our neighbors son to see it.

I asked your military to come see it, but they have the same thing to say to us it could be a jet.

Tonite, I have heard over the news about a jet going down in Mt View which is not far from San Jose where we live. It want into a house on Feb 15, 1950.

Lick Observatory is right in the area above us where this strange object seem to be most of the time.

I ask you to look into these facts.

San Jose, Calif.

The text in the document reads:

"But now I can't call them hallucinations. I have just done a thorough study of the case and I am convinced that they really saw a strange, metallic, saucer-shaped object, that was hovering over the ground at a low altitude. It was about 50 feet in diameter and 10 to 15 feet thick. The object was seen by three men and they all described it in the same way. There was no evidence of any kind of propulsion system, no smoke, no exhaust, no noise. It just seemed to float and hover above the ground. At one point, it took off at a terrific rate of speed, literally vanishing from sight. The men were badly shaken by the incident and I am convinced that they were telling the truth. I can't explain what they saw, but I know that they saw something very strange and real. I would appreciate any advice or suggestions you might have about this case."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report that describes a sonic boom heard in the Santa Clara Valley in California. The text output is as follows:

Sonic Boom
Heard In Valley
A sonic boom, apparently caused by a jet aircraft traveling in a north-south direction, was heard by numerous residents in parts of Santa Clara Valley.
News reports today indicated the sonic boom was heard over a wide area, from Alomaden, through San Jose, to Palo Alto.
First reports indicated the sonic boom occurred at 8:30 p.m. The responsible aircraft was not sighted.

The image shared does not contain any photographic content. Instead, it appears to be a handwritten page from a document or report. The handwritten text describes an observation or incident related to a "UFO" or unidentified flying object.

Transcription of the text:

Families, I have heard about the noise about a jet going down in Mt View. I will have to go over to see if I can get some information on that tonight.

March 18, 1960

Sighting observation as might be the thing after all. Unidentified object came at high speed had changed color and shape, in the mount of these facts would be bound to believe they might have something.
