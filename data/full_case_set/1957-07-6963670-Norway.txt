Location: Newby -
Date: 29 Aug 1957
Hour: X - 1930
Description: See photograph
Direction of Motion: West-Northwest (azimuth 300-310) 
Astronomical Phenomena (meteor, comet, planet, etc.): - 
Radar Analysis (ARCIN-1): -
Natural Phenomena (ball lightning, etc.): -
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: -
Other: This object appears to be a bright light source behind a cloud mass. Evaluation and analysis of source and reliability: Initially interpreted as a possible meteor but later discounted due to lack of trail and trajectory. 
Analysis and Conclusions: This object appears on the basis of the account given to have been a bright light source behind a cloud mass. The appearance and motion of the object do not fit the characteristics of common astronomical, meteorological, or aeronautical phenomena. The reliability of the witness is considered good although evaluation of the object is tentative and uncertain.

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a text description of a photograph, but there is no actual photograph visible in the image provided.

The text describes a photograph taken by an American tourist in Norway in August 1953. The description states that the photograph appears to show a large white, disk-shaped object hovering above the ground. The text goes on to explain the various details observed in the photograph, such as the reflection of the object in the landscape, the presence of smoke or steam, and the position of the person's hand and finger in relation to the object.

In August 1953 an American tourist in Norway snapped a picture of a dome on a cliff above the sea. It was observed some time later that the print showed a large white, disk-shaped object hovering above the ground. The print had been enlarged to show the contours better, and ATIC investigators, through comparison of the negative with the print, admitted that something was there, though they couldn't be sure what.

Through study of the negative, the investigators found that there were no mechanical or other defects in the camera itself, nor to the film, that could have accounted for the object. Further study of the terrain around the spot where the photograph was taken revealed nothing to account for the object. The investigators were baffled by the phenomenon, they could find no natural explanation for the object shown in the photograph.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, with only text visible.

JULY 9, 1957 an OBSERVATION did developed for some time afterward.
It was only after the film was developed that two witnesses noticed an unusual object. The witness saw that there was no more trail than a film. This odd object was near the moon and was quite small.
The witness reports so have resulted from a discussion as the man's view passed all impressions as a clear. The object appeared of light passing to the left. This could only have stayed a few more than a flash, so the photographer, as the camera passed only a specific position, could not have obtained more than a flash."

The image contains a photograph of a "Saucer photographed over Norway". The photograph shows a bright, glowing object in the sky over a landscape. There is also a second photograph of a "GLOWING OBJECT OVER GERMAN TOWN", which shows a bright, glowing object in the sky over what appears to be a town or city.

World Roundup 
Saucer photographed over Norway
"One day in July, 1957, Mrs. William Reton, Borton, of Great Barrington, Mass., U.S.A., was taking a picture of Norway's landscape when she noticed a strange object in the sky. The object, she said, moved rapidly and more or less silently as it passed across the Norway sky, and then seemed to disappear. Mrs. Reton said she had no idea what the object was, but she did manage to take a picture of it. The picture, she said, showed an oddly-shaped, disc-like object which she had never seen before."

GLOWING OBJECT OVER GERMAN TOWN
"This photograph shows an odd glowing object photographed over a German town at twilight. The object appeared for only a few moments, then disappeared. The incident was reported but no explanation for the sighting was ever given."

Dear Allen:

Thank you for your confirming letter regarding the Copper Mountain observation. We have studied the data you so kindly forwarded to us, and we think it would be of interest to astronomers.

Our analysis indicates it was a meteor, perhaps a fieball, which was observed. There are certain points that lead us to this conclusion, the chief one being that the observers described the object as increasing in brightness and then fading, which is typical of meteoric phenomena. We also note that the duration of the sighting was very brief, less than a minute, which is again characteristic of meteors.

It seems to us that the various effects described, such as the object appearing to fall behind the mountain range and the reported sound effects, may have been caused by atmospheric conditions and the geometrical relationship of the observers to the object. The descriptions do not seem to us to be those that one would expect from a "Fellows" sighting.

We appreciate your interest in sending us the details. It was obviously caused by a light source, but light from a natural source in the sky, not an artificial one. Whether the pictures were taken or not is, of course, immaterial, since the evidence seems clear that this was a natural phenomenon and not an unidentified flying object.

A number of people were who have been following the reports of UFO sightings are now beginning to realize that the great majority of them are caused by natural occurrences. We would be interested in any further data you may obtain on this kind of event. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Best regards,
Yours very truly,
(Signed) George Eastman

SKY FARM - NORTH EGREMONT - MASSACHUSETTS
Feb. 5, June 5th, 1957

Secretary of Defense, Neil H. McElroy 
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. McElroy:

My friend and neighbor Mr. William H. Herridge, suggests I send you enclosed photographs of the Willis la England last summer. I took the color transparency of the object, which I believe to be a flying saucer. The pictures were very clear and the object was quite large and round, but I'm not interested, but useless in the Nov/Dec, 1957 issue of their magazine.

Now, I have some 8 x 10 color prints from a slide which might be rather interesting. These making a fair 8 x 10 print, would give a Mr. Armstrong of the firm of Dunn & Armstrong of New York a fine background color. I believe he would accept one for analysis, providing postage cost is prepaid.

I also enclose my one and only colored "saucer" sent to me in a letter received from a HANSON-which is a non-identified correlated investigation of UFO-ASADECOR. I sight that this address is SPAN CLAYTON, Texas. The mail man claims it was forwarded to France, but I have never received it. 

I also have a letter received from a CHENEA-VERNON-which is in reference to an address in SPAN, CLAYTON, Texas. For this purpose we need a first class positive or negative so these seems to come such an interest in my snap-shot. I thought you might be interested to look at them.

I would appreciate your comments. Friends who are aware of it call it a "saucer", but friends who are photographers claim it is not a "saucer" but just a distorted reflection. I cannot tell, but I friends who are aware of it call it a "saucer", but friends who are photographers claim it is not a "saucer" but just a distorted reflection. I cannot tell, but I am enclosing the material for your evaluation and comments.

Sincerely yours,

1. The subject photography has been examined but no conclusion can be reached as to the cause of the apparent circular images. Possible causes are an instrument aberration, double exposure, or some sort of reflection if the photograph is the product of a wide-angle lens processing, or less likely, a deliberate double exposure.

2. It is suggested that the photograph be shown to an expert on photographic processing, or less re-processing.

September 4, 1959

Dear Sir:

I am enclosing a letter written by you to Mr. Joe Bray, of my farm, North Bermont, Massachusetts, with reference to her letter which was addressed to Secretary of Defense, McGilroy. 

Mrs. has filled out, you will note, the additional information as requested. Since then, she has received a letter from the editor of the Swedish Magazine, PATTERSON SAUCER REPORTS, asking for a copy of this photograph, and a film. In his letter he states that a friend of his during a vacation in Germany last summer--1950--had a somewhat similar experience. One day he saw a silver chrome disk in the sky.

In your letter you state that as soon as the evaluation is complete you will forward the results to Mrs. and return the photograph and film, you may do so. As I have had duplicates made of the original film.

Mrs. who is an intimate friend of my wife, is now on her way to London, and therefore I should like to have your advise about the evaluation, and I shall take pleasure in forwarding it to her.

Very truly yours,
