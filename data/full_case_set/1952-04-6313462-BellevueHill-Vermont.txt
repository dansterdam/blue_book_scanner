AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT OVER CAVENDISH, VERMONT, 26 APRIL 1952

1. On 26 April 1952 at 0500 hours EST, a crew of F-94 jet aircraft was alerted to the unidentified flying object observed in the area of Cavendish, Vermont.

2. The object was described as being round, disc-shaped, and about the size of a C-47 aircraft. It was observed to be hovering and then to accelerate to an extremely high speed and disappear.

3. The object was observed by several ground observers as well as the aircraft crew. The observation lasted approximately two or three minutes, the object paralleled the aircraft at one point and then accelerated to a very high speed and disappeared.

4. The object was described as being white and blue in appearance, and appeared to be metallic in nature. There were no other discernible features. The object seemed to be under some form of intelligent control, and their size to be the proportion of a C-47.

5. The above incident was reported by the crew of the F-94 and investigating officers on the scene. Weather in the area was clear and visibility was good.

DONALD A. POWELL
MAJOR, USAF, DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE, 

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICERS:
The F-94 crew members reporting above data made their initial report 15 minutes after the observation. Their observation was also reported by ground observers in the area.
