AN INTERVIEW BY THE INVESTIGATOR WITH THE OBSERVER REVEALED THE FOLLOWING FACTS OBSERVED LIVES ALONE ON A FARM ON THE WEST EDGE OF KINDRAE, MINN. HE IS A RETIRED MAIL CARRIER AND DIVORCEE. HE HAS LIVED ALONE FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS. DURING THE INTERVIEW THE OBSERVER STATED THAT A SIMILAR INCIDENT (WHICH HE DID NOT REPORT) OCCURRED WHEN 2 RUSSIAN MIG AIRCRAFT APPEARED ON HIS FARM. HE INDICATED THAT HE SPOKE WITH THEM DURING THIS TIME. HE WOULD OFFER NO FURTHER INFORMATION OF THIS INCIDENT.
