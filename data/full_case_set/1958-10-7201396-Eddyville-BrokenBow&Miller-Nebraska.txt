STATEMENT

1. After a discussion with North Platte GCI and Able Bodied, I called Idaho GCI and asked them to divert the high unit on fuel to Sombrero Blue flight for Idaho control to check a UFO. At 0552z Sombrero Blue 1 was diverted to Idaho GCI in 47-6010.

2. Sombrero Blue 1 was vectored directly to the object area in FM 2221 at 35,000 feet. To facilitate positioning the interceptor as close to the object as possible it was requested that GOC obtain a visual on the object. The interceptor pilot reported the object slowing down enough to lower his landing lights. As soon as the interceptor closed within 1,000 feet, the objects was observed (first in Nebraska) the landing light was turned off and retracted, and a vector given to the objects position. Badyville, Nebraska maintained contact with the interceptor by watching the controls. As vectors were received from GCI the object was vectored to in close proximity. The pilot reported he could not establish lock-on to these two passes the pilot requested information on the objects position placed the object 15 nautical miles west of the moon. The pilot did not see anything in this position. No interceptor could decode contact below 32,000 feet because of fuel and distance from nearest recovery base.

3. The pilot checked with higher on the ground and could see nothing that could possibly correspond to the objects light pattern. The reason for checking the possibility that the observers were seeing some light on the ground that was being reflected by the temperature inversion. A temperature inversion was existing between 3,000 and 5,500 feet. Positive GCI control was maintained at all times with Sombrero Blue 1.

4. A request was placed with CAA (Kansas City Center) through Able Bodied to ask several aircraft flying through the area to report any unusual lights in the sky. Several air liners flying at 20,000 and 23,000 feet reported nothing unusual.

5. No radar contact was ever obtained by Idaho with the object.

6. This is a true and accurate account of the UFO incident (intercept position) occuring on 30 October 1958.

STATEMENT

On October 29, 1956 at approximately 0230 while running practice intercepts as a pilot of three F-86D's under Fronie Control, I was directed to contact Fronie Control. 

On contact with Idaho, the controller requested I proceed to a point near Eddyville, Nebraska. I did so under his direction at 25,000 ft. altitude.

While enroute, I was given the following description of U.F.O.B. sighted in the area by G.C.I.C. "The object is circular in shape with red and green lights around it, altitude unknown, but at a distance that made it appear to be the size of a dime. Both the color and motion were slowly to the east." At the time it was sighted, weather was clear with very good visibility due to the very bright moonlight.

Upon reaching the area, I searched in all directions, also above and below with no success. At this time I requested G.C.I.C. to get visual contact on me and steer me to the object visually. I reduced speed and extended the landing lights for better identification by G.C.I.C.

G.C.I.C. relayed their instructions through Fronie controller and on several occasions carried that I was nearing very near to object.

I was unable to get any contact either visually or on the radar scope.

I continued the search as long as fuel permitted, about 20 minutes, and then returned to Lincoln Air Force Base and landed.
