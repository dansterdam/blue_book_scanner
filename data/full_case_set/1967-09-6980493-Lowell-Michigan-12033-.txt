Case #12033

Summary:

On September 6, 1967, at approximately 10:30 p.m., Mr. Paul Miller and his wife observed an unidentified flying object (UFO) over their home in Lowell, Michigan. 

The object was described as a bright, disc-shaped craft that hovered silently in the sky for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view. 

Mr. Miller reported the incident to the local police, who in turn notified the Air Force's Project Blue Book for investigation.

Investigators from Project Blue Book conducted interviews with the witnesses and collected additional evidence, but were unable to determine the exact nature or origin of the observed object.

The case was classified as "unidentified" and added to the Project Blue Book files for further analysis and potential future reference.

The image appears to contain a black-and-white photograph of a dark night sky with scattered stars. There is a small white object visible in the image, which could possibly be a UFO or another celestial body. However, I cannot conclusively identify or name any objects in the image.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

SUBJECT -Object Sighted over Lowell, Michigan, on September 6, 1967

1. On 6 September 1967, a report was received from Mrs. Marie Dewitt, 13333 Fulton, Lowell, Michigan, concerning an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighted by herself and her husband, Floyd Dewitt, on the evening of 6 September 1967.

2. According to the report, the Dewitts observed a bright, round, disc-shaped object hovering over a field near their residence. The object was first sighted about 9:00 PM and was observed for approximately 15 minutes before disappearing. The object was described as being about 50 feet in diameter and emitting a bright, steady light. No sound was heard.

3. The investigator, Capt. George Gregory, 4602 Air Base Squadron, made a field investigation on 8 September 1967. Capt. Gregory interviewed the Dewitts and examined the area where the object was sighted. He also checked with local police and air traffic control, but was unable to obtain any additional information or corroborating reports.

4. Based on the investigation, Capt. Gregory concluded that the object sighted was possibly a meteor, a star, or a very distant aircraft. However, the Dewitts remained convinced that the object was a UFO.

5. No further investigation is planned at this time. The case is being filed as UNIDENTIFIED.

TEXT CONTENT:

LOWELL, MICHIGAN
12 33 P.M. 24 SEPTEMBER 1967
UFO REPORT
Subject: Obect sighted by witness at 12:33 PM. Witness's name: GERALD GRAPPERS. Witness's address: 742 Pearl St., Lowell, Michigan.
Witness's account: At 12:33 PM on 24 September 1967, I was standing in my backyard and looked up into the sky. I saw a round, metallic object hovering in the air. It appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter and was silver in color. The object was moving slowly from west to east at a constant speed. After observing it for about 2 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and shot straight up into the sky at a tremendous speed, disappearing from view within seconds.
Investigator's comments: The witness appears to be credible and provided a consistent account of the sighting. There were no other known objects or activities in the sky at the time that could explain what the witness observed. The rapid acceleration and disappearance of the object is consistent with other UFO reports. The case is classified as unidentified.
