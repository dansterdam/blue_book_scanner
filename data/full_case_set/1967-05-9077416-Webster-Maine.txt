THERE IS ONE LAST FACT I FAILED TO MENTION, ON AND ON THE TAIL END OF THE UFO WERE LINED UP ABOUT DRAFTS' EXCEPT FOR THE RIGHT ALONG ONLY ONE . NOTED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT.

I HOPE SINCERELY THAT YOU GIVE THIS REPORT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, FOR I FEEL IT TO BE IMPORTANT, AND DON'T WRITE IT OFF JUST AS A "USUAL EFFORT" SEEN UNDER UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR NO "USUAL" OBJECT COULD HAVE DONE WHAT I SAW, AND IF YOU THINK THE HOAX" WHICH I ASSURE YOU ARE NOT. THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER FACTS I COULD RELATE ABOUT, SO I WOULD LIKE IT IF YOU WOULD SEND ME A QUESTIONNAIRE THAT I COULD FILL OUT.

I AM AN AMATEUR ASTRONOMER, AND I AM USED TO NOTING UNUSUAL DETAIL. I WILL ENCLOSE A GENERAL FLIGHT PATTERN, WHICH WILL NOTE SPEED AT DIFFERENT POINTS.

THANK YOU.

1. PURPOSE: This report is written to fulfill a request, Work Order Number 67-72, from Major H. Quintanilla, Jr., TDAI/ODO, to identify the flying object which appears to have been observed.
2. ANALYSIS: Lack of image definition in the photo precludes identification of the object. As analysis of the original negative, however, may possibly reveal more, it is recommended that prints which can be cleaned from the paper prints.

June 12, 1966

The undersigned is a retired aircraft inspector who has been interested in the subject of unidentified flying objects for many years. Last night, at about 8:30 PM, he witnessed an extremely unusual aerial phenomenon which he is unable to identify. The object was first observed hovering over the Webster Lake area. It suddenly accelerated at a terrific speed and climbed rapidly into the sky, disappearing from view. The object was bright white in color and was observed for several minutes. No noise was heard. The night was clear and there were no clouds. The object seemed to be under intelligent control.

The undersigned feels that this sighting is worthy of investigation and he would be willing to cooperate fully with any official agency that might be interested in pursuing this matter further. The undersigned is a highly reliable observer and he is certain that what he witnessed was something extraordinary and not of this world.

1. The Aerial Phenomena Office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from Trenton, New Jersey which occurred at 9:30 pm on 13 May 1967.

2. Witnesses described the object as a yellow, white, flat oval that had two high intensity lights on it. One in the rear and one in the front. There was a red strobe like light flashing on and off. It hovered and dipped below the trees and the craft was silent as it maneuvered.

3. Will you please verify any similar reports on this evening? Since detailed aerial advertising signs are often mistaken for UFO's do you have any operating over the city during the early evening?

Gentlemen:
I am writing you because I have not had results or conclusions on the investigation of the UFO on May 13. could you please send me the results of the investigation or the progress of it? Also, could you please be interested that during a recent project or mine of making a star chart using photographs, I observed on several nights "V" signs or lights. At first, I thought they were just lighting, but they seemed to have a pattern to them. I even managed to catch one on film, but I did not focus in the constellation Orion, 2 degrees east of M42. If you can photograph I will send it at your request. It can be seen as genuine by the sharpness of both the lights and of the constellation. Indicating that it was not very close.
Thank you for your valuable time.
Sincerely,
