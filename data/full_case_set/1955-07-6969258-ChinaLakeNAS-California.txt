When this object was sighted it was moving rapidly to the east. This object was at a high altitude and appeared to be moving steadily at a speed estimated to be less than 800 m.p.h. It appeared to be circular in shape and was very bright, emitting a blue-white light. Its size appeared to be about 25-30 feet in diameter. It was observed through 7x50 binoculars for a period of about 2-3 minutes. The object changed directions abruptly when it was about 25-30 degrees above the horizon and disappeared from sight in a Northeasterly direction. This occurred because the Air Force had requested that we look for an object in that area.

II. RELIABILITY: 3. UNGER's memory of incident was very good. He
consists attitude to be of little help was very impressive. He
really volunteered inform and apparently makes sincere
effort to give a complete and accurate picture of his
observations. His statements were positive, with the
exception of what the object might possibly have been.
The object was described as definitely not any known
aircraft. No identification was made as to the object
on the initial sighting. It seemed to be more knowledge
on the object than the eyewitness. UNGER stated the
object appeared to be just a little limited in size
and maneuverability. His knowledge of his job, however,
was very good and complete. The incident described
should be considered by the rating and judged accordingly.

III. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:

Air Facility on a close from
on China Lake Naval
towards, California (China SBS 249°). and was asked to look for an
unusual light that had been reported. At this time the duty officer
had a call from the commanding officer stating a strange object was in
to look to the north. This time short spotted the object.

2. The object was in the northern sky at a heading of 310 degrees and
when first sighted. Object moved on a heading of 310 degrees for 7 or 8 minutes
then counterclockwise in a sweeping turn of 270 degrees back to the object's original
position. This portion of the flight covered 1 minute. The object then moved out
of sight on a heading measure by astro-compass to be 50 degrees. The total time
observed was approximately 10-12 minutes.

3. During the time that the object was in sight (23 - 25 minutes)
appeared to accelerate to an extremely high speed rapidly, Suddenly
reduced its speed to come to a complete stop, hover for a while, and then accelerate
again. The color remained constant. UNGER also stated that it
appeared to oscillate (vibrate) while in flight.

4. No additional lights or exhause were seen. The object did not appear
to change in size or shape. It seemed to be round or oval in shape,
and about the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length. It was
orange in color with a bright center.

5. Sighting through 6 power binoculars, SOURCE observed a faint
trail or wisp of color behind the object as the object moved. This trail appeared
darker in color than the object proper.

1. The object disappeared approximately 6 times into it's normal position, however, that it was possible that the object moved behind some mountains. The object always reappeared at its original position.

2. The object disappeared in a westerly direction growing dimmer and dimmer. It did not reappeared again.

3. Burnner watched the object with his binoculars but was unable to determine any details. He heard no sound and also thought that a jet would not have its afterburners on so low.

4. The weather was cool with a little breeze blowing. It was completely dark with no moonlight.

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORT:

1. A check with the MARCH AFB, CALIFORNIA (MARCH FIELD) flight service Center revealed that no incidents were in the general vicinity of the China Lake Air Force Base, California, on 19 May 1955.

CHINA LAKE, CALIFORNIA, FLIGHT ACTIVITY 19 MAY 1955:
At the China Lake Air Force Base, CALIFORNIA, a check was made with the Base Operations Office, and it was revealed that no unusual activity took place on that date. An F-86 aircraft made a flight but did not observe anything unusual.

CHINA LAKE, CALIFORNIA, FLIGHT ACTIVITY 17 JULY 1955:
On 17 July 1955 an unidentified aircraft, jet or rocket, was observed from LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, to pass from the southwest to the northeast. The aircraft was observed a distance of 150 miles from LAS VEGAS, NEVADA (JADE 12232) when the flash was noticed. The pilot was not available for interview, however, the time of the flash was 1205:02 JUL 55.

On 17 July 1955 the AF C & E site at BORON, CALIFORNIA (39:06 083W) revealed that a flash of light had been seen in the northern sky at 1205:02 JUL 55. The flash was observed visually and on the radarscope, but no objects were seen.

4. A check with Flight Operations at GEORGE AFB, CALIFORNIA, (34:39 N - 117:27 W) revealed that they had been interviewed. Two F-86's were scrambled at 1205:02 on 17 JUL 55.

5. A check with Combat Operations Center, 29th Air Division (Defense) NORTON AFB, CALIFORNIA revealed that no unusual activity took place in the CHINA LAKE area on 17 JUL 55. NORTON AFB, however.

6. A check with the Ground Observer Corps Filter Center at PASADENA, CALIFORNIA (34:08N-118:10W) and the SECURITY GUARD COMMANDER, CALIFORNIA (CASE 6029) revealed that no unusual activity was reported from the CHINA LAKE area on 17 JUL 55.

7. DR. BOWEN, Chief Astronomer at the MT. WILSON OBSERVATORY (CASE 5711) was contacted: He stated that the sighting was not considered unusual and that to his knowledge, nothing unusual had been seen and reported from his observatory.

10. GEORGE BEATTIE, Professor of Astronomy, San Bernardino Valley College, California, was interviewed. Professor BEATTIE stated that he had been consulted by AUTHORITIES regarding this case, and that in his opinion, based on the length of time the object was in sight, it would possibly preclude the possibility of the object being astronomical in nature.

PAGE 17 OF 20 PAGES

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. The preparing officer was unable to come to any definitive conclusion as to the identification or classification of the visual aid described.
2. The following possibilities are offered for consideration:
- Considering the length of sighting, the hovering, speeding up and near level flight characteristics exhibited, it appears that this may have been an advanced type of aircraft which the witnesses could not identify. 
- The object was at such a distance that the details were not clearly seen. Even so, the witness reported that it was blowing between 10 and 15,000 feet at one point and between 5 and 10,000 feet at another. This sudden reversal in course would seem to preclude the possibility of its being a manned or remote controlled aircraft.
- It is possible that the object was that of a highly classified or experimental type of aircraft, possibly a new type of jet. Also, the object was between the size of a dime held at arm's length and it was high enough to catch the sun's rays. This would seem to indicate that the object was much larger than a conventional aircraft.
- Through the binoculars, the object then continued on its nearly course at a leisurely pace until it disappeared from view. This would seem to indicate a much higher rate of speed than any known conventional aircraft at that time.

3. The three individuals who spotted the object were briefed on the following possibilities:
- It may have been some form of military or experimental aircraft or other airborne vehicle, in which case they should avoid any conclusions or discussion until the matter could be properly investigated.
- It might have been some natural phenomenon, such as a meteor or atmospheric disturbance, which could account for the unusual appearance and movements.
- All three were familiar with air traffic and none had any ideas or conclusions concerning the sighting.

Air Intelligence Information Report of 1 July 1955. Although a great deal of meteorological activity was noted on the night of 13 July 1955, the witnesses reported that the object they saw was solid, silvery and disc-shaped. The sudden disappearance of the object was observed by the airliner pilot and the controller tower. Although the sighting took place at about 11:30 PM, it was fairly clear and all three witnesses had a good view of the object. It is the opinion of the preparing officer that the object cannot be satisfactorily explained on the basis of the information presently available.

The text in the document is as follows:

This headquarters does not concur with the possible causes of this sighting offered by the reporting officer, for the following reasons:
a. Balloon possibility: The sudden reversal of direction, the high rate of speed, and the direction changes all eliminate this possibility.
b. Aircraft possibility: The duration of the sighting, the slow movement to the east, the lack of sound, and the non-conforming flight characteristics would eliminate this possibility.
c. Astronomical activity: The fact that this object was initially sighted at 45 degrees elevation and the detection of the object was maintained for some length of time would eliminate the possibility of astronomical activity.
d. Critical phenomena: This object was initially picked up on radar and was seen by three people for a long period of time, thereby eliminating the possibility of optical phenomena.
2. This report is forwarded to ATIC as "unknown".
