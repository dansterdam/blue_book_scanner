The image does not contain any photographs. It contains two sketches or illustrations.

The first sketch shows a curved line with the text "Place an 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) where you last saw it."

The second sketch is a larger one that shows multiple views or sketches. The main one appears to show a person standing on a road or path with buildings or structures in the background. There is a smaller sketch in the top right corner that shows a similar view but from a different perspective.

Transcribing the text in the document:

The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon, and instructions to mark points "A" and "B" on the line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon. The second and third sketches depict larger scenes, with a person walking on a road in the middle sketch and a landscape with a curved horizon in the smaller sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

The report describes an observation of an unidentified track on radar near Okinawa, Japan, which was tracked by the 623rd Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron. The object was tracked for approximately 3 1/2 minutes, moving at a speed of 600-700 knots at an altitude of 33,000-35,000 feet. The report states that the object was "unusual" and "rapid maneuvers" were observed.

NARRATIVE: On 15 December 1952 at approximately 205/1 an unidentified track appeared on the radar sets of the Charlottesville, Virginia, filter center (AAFSIN-2S6). The target appeared shortly before 205/1 just north-west of Charlottesville, Virginia, about 10 miles. It was traveling at an estimated speed of 120 knots on a slightly curving course to the north-west. The target was seen on the first, second and third sweeps of the radar. The size of the target was estimated to be about double that of a standard aircraft target. The estimated speed was 120 miles per hour.

All blips seen were about double target size. Negative results were obtained from a radar checkpoint made on the remainder of the radar sites in this area for a possible sighting of the same track.

In reply refer to 

Charlottesville, Virginia

The Air Force has been advised by a number of Virginia that on 15 November 1952, you and two other people observed an unusual type of aircraft over Charlottesville, Virginia. Based on this information, and a subsequent message which was dated 18 November 1952, it is concluded that the object observed was not necessarily an explainable observation, and therefore it is requested that the enclosed data sheet be completed and returned.

The names of the other observers were not given in the wire, consequently, I will be very much interested in having you submit the names and addresses of the other observers, if any, so that the necessary follow-up can be made.

Any information you desire to give to the Air Force will be held in strict confidence.

Yours very truly,

The handwritten text in the description space reads:
"I was looking at the sky when I noticed a strange formation of lights which I called to the attention of other members of my family. We all saw the same thing. The lights appeared to be moving in an irregular pattern, changing directions abruptly and also slowing down and speeding up in a very erratic manner. I looked up and saw that they were larger than stars and also brighter. I could not make out any definite shape or outline, only a cluster of lights. At times, it looked as if they might be circling some invisible center, but I could not be certain of this. The lights appeared to be at a considerable distance and at a high altitude. I watched them for several minutes and then they seemed to disappear. I do not know if they went behind clouds or just faded from sight. I cannot offer any explanation for what I saw. It was most unusual and unlike anything I have ever observed before."
