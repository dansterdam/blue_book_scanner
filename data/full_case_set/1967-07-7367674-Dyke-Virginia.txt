The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically record 10073, dated July 1, 1967, from Dyke, Virginia. The report describes an observed "possible (AIRCRAFT)", with the observer stating that the object appeared to be a bright light and was compared to the size of a bright star. The object was observed for 1 minute, and the report indicates that no sound or physical evidence was observed.

There does not appear to be any photograph in this image. This appears to be a scanned page of a Project Blue Book document, containing handwritten text describing a sighting of what was perceived as a UFO.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  22 Day - 6 Month - 62 Year
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or its narrative explanation of your sighting:

The thing that was not clearly depicted was that the object was seen which appeared as a bright light, went off and on and traveled across the sky. The periods of illumination were approximately 5-8 seconds apart, and very silent. It had no color and no resemblance whatsoever to an airplane, being much larger and we definitely felt it was a complete missing or not adding of anything around it. There were searchlights in the area that had searching and were not connected to it and were intermittent as the flashing. We are certain it was not a plane because it must have been flying low to get under the cloud cover and yet there was no sound. It was also traveling too rapidly for a plane to sweep an entire sky in that little time. This whole minute caused a good deal of amazement to those seeing it, and especially the people who had come to watch the meteor shower and were awestruck by what they saw.

TSTC/UFO (Maj Quintanilla/70916/rhe/12 Aug 67)

UFO Observation, 1 July 1957

1. The Aerial Phenomena Branch is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report for 1 July 1957. The sighting occurred at Charlottesville Airport, Charlottesville, Virginia. The witnesses described the object as bright, glowing, and moving very rapidly across the sky. The object was estimated to have traveled from horizon to horizon in approximately thirty seconds; it disappeared in the northeast.

2. Any information you can provide as to a possible cause for this 1 July 1957 sighting would be helpful in our analysis. Indications are that the object was not seen by radar controllers and was not confirmed as an aircraft or similar UFO by the same or similar UFO.

"PENDING
under 2 minutes report - caught all of action

The Dunn Bros School, Route 2/296

Unidentified flying objects(s) sighted
Wm. B. McCann, Route 2, Charlottesville, Virginia

Dear Sirs:
I am not sure if such an individual account would be believed by you or not, but my husband and I thought that an sighting we had on July 12 might be worthy of record in any case.

We are residing temporarily (until house 6) at the Blue Ridge Motel which is 15 miles north east of Charlottesville, Virginia near the Blue Ridge mountains. We have been travelling and saw the object last night at about 10:30.

This object was very strange and seemed to have fluorescent edges or outline and was moving in a 'zig-zag' fashion, to be more specific a wavy motion like a sine wave. It did not seem to have propulsion in the usual sense, rather it just seemed to move under the control of whatever was guiding it.

This object also seemed to have the ability to change direction instantly by 90 degrees or more at will, which would indicate some sort of control not dependent on conventional momentum. We watched it for perhaps 2 or 3 minutes as it moved from the northeast to the southwest, its movement being unbelievable irregular or erratic. As it moved away into the distance it appeared to just 'wink out' rather than disappear from view normally.

I would not be writing this note except that the sighting was so remarkable and so unexplainable in conventional terms. My husband is an electrical engineer and fully capable of evaluating such phenomena, and both of us are quite certain that this was not a conventional aircraft of any kind.

I hope that this account may be of some interest to your organization, although I realize that individual sightings of this sort can be difficult to evaluate scientifically. If you should desire any further information, please feel free to contact me."

This is a report of the incident as we observed it.

At approximately 6:30 p.m. on 30 June 1967, I was standing in front of my home with my wife and three of my children. We observed a strange object in the sky about 2 miles north of us, which appeared to be hovering and oscillating back and forth for about 15 minutes. The object seemed to be metallic in appearance and was giving off a brilliant light. It was very large, possibly 50 to 60 feet in diameter. At times, it seemed to be surrounded by a sort of halo or glow. The object was seen by several other people in the neighborhood, and my wife and children were quite frightened and disturbed by it.

After the 15 minutes, the object suddenly moved rapidly to the east and disappeared from sight. I was able to obtain a series of photographs showing the object, but only one of them seems to be of any value as the others were not clear or distinct. Frankly, we are not sure what it was that we saw, but it was definitely not any kind of conventional aircraft or helicopter. If any further information is needed, please let me know.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
