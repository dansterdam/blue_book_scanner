PROJECT 10,075 RECORD
2. LOCATION
Dayton, Ohio.
10. CONCLUSION
Possible (METEOR)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer sighted an object that was a bright red color in droping (like meteors or such) and it appeared to be trailing a long tail behind it. It was arking into the ground."  It was seen for 5 to 10 seconds and made no noise.
COMMENTS: The duration and flight path of the object are consistent with a meteor observation.  However the observer since no one else in the Dayton area reported seeing an UFO and because the characteristics are so similar to those of a meteor observation, this sighting is listed as a possible meteor.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing questions and answers about a reported UFO sighting.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The written response indicates that the object did not disappear, but rather slowly faded away.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The response indicates that the object moved behind something, but the observer is unsure if it was a cloud.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The response indicates that the object did move in front of something, but the observer is unsure if it was a cloud.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - None
b. Color - Steady, milky white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the hand of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
The written response provides an approximate estimate of the object's angular size, indicating that the object would have been covered by about 1/4 to 1/2 of the match stick held at arm's length.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
The document contains a handwritten sketch and text describing the observed object, including details about its shape and any observed trails.
