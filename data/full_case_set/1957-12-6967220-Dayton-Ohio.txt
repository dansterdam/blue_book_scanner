SUBJECT Extract from SDO Report, 22 Dec 57
TO AFOIN-33) 	FROM AFOIN-23A	DATE 23 Dec 57
Following is an extract from SDO, OHO & B Tenold's report of 22 Dec 57 for your information:  
"1730 - Phone call received from a Mr ---------------- Dayton, Ohio (Tel CR 5-2293) on a UFO. I filled out questionnaire to best of my ability from information he related. Mr ----------------- stated that at approximately 1700 hrs, 22 Dec 57, he and his wife were looking out window and saw a large, bright light in the sky which appeared to change directions and move swiftly. As it moved closer, it seemed to split into several smaller objects, at which time he called the police. The police did not arrive in time to see the objects. Mr ----------------- stated the objects were of definite size and the motion was erratic, zigzagging, and at times appeared to be hovering. He felt the objects were unusual and probably a new type of aircraft, and he was interested in reporting the incident. I advised him that I would record the information and forward it to proper channels."

The image contains two sketches.

The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon (skyline) and an object above it. The instructions ask you to imagine being at the point shown and to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it. You are then asked to place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it.

The second sketch shows two larger scenes. The main scene appears to be a landscape with buildings and trees, with a person standing in the foreground. The smaller scene on the right shows a silhouetted person standing on a road with mountains in the background.
