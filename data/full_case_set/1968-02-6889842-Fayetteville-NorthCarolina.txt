The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, and it consists of illustrations and text.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving, if any.

LAST SIGHTING OF THE FIRST OBJECT RETURNED AT 2345 MINUTES WHICH IS 11:45 PM
APPROXIMATE AZIMUTH OF FIRST OBJECT 260 DEGREES
APPROXIMATE ALTITUDE OF FIRST OBJECT 30 DEGREES

There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this scanned document. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text in the document is as follows:

34. Did you completed this questionnarie:

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnarie or a narrative explanation of your sighting. As the object, at times passed over trees and building, I estimated 30 minutes of observation. At one point it seemed to hover about tree top height and appeared to be oscillating back and forth. It seemed to be at times round, and other times cylindrical or trumpet shaped. There were times it appeared to change shape and appear elongated or pointed at one end. During this time I observed it to make several apparent maneuvers, such as stopping and starting, changing direction, and also accelerating or increasing its speed. Although at times the object seemed to be only a point of light, at other times it displayed illumination throughout its outline. The object appeared to have no protrusions or appendages, however, certain periods observation led me to believe it was oscillating through some type of motion or pattern that created an illusion of such. Approximate size of the object ranged from a baseball to a basketball held at arm's length. I am not certain as to its actual size, however, as I am not familiar with judging distance and size of object in the heavens. The object was being observed against a clear, blue sky, except for the occasional cloud. It was observed throughout the observation period to gradually gain altitude. Initially it was observed at approximately 45-50 degrees above the horizon, and by the end of the observation period it had gained considerable altitude, perhaps 60-65 degrees. There were no noticeable sounds associated with the object. I did observe two aircraft in the area during the sighting, however, they appeared to be commercial jets and did not seem to have any association with the object. I feel certain that the object I observed was not a conventional aircraft, satellite, or celestial body. Its appearance, motion and lack of sound leads me to conclude it was an unidentified flying object. I would be willing to cooperate fully with any further investigation of this matter.

REPLY TO 
ATTN OF: DOIN (Capt Emmingham/4777)

SUBJECT: UFO Report

TO: FTD (TDETR)

1. In accordance with AFR 80-17 the attached report is forwarded.

2. Due to the proximity of several airfields in the area of this sighting (including Fayetteville Municipal Airfield, Simmons Army Air Field, and Pope AFB) I believe the UFO reported can be attributed to various aircraft or helicopter lights.
