UFO Report (Major Goldsman)

1. This case concerns the attached copy of a letter to ATIC (9TD) from an unidentified source pertaining to several UFO incidents in the Bucyrus and Bellevue, Ohio, area on 8 June 1961.

2. The origin of the information in the letter is not known. The person appears to be a civilian and the letter includes a statement indicating that the writer is associated with the school system in Bucyrus. The credibility and reliability of this source is unknown.

3. The object sighted by the source and described in the letter has not been further identified. No final evaluation has been made on this report. However, it is suggested to handle this informant life with caution due to the identity of this object has been reached.

Subject: Unusual Objects in Western Ohio

1. Relative flying objects. On June 30th, 1961, this object was observed in the western part of Ohio, as follows:

a. The first object sighted was on June 29th about an hour after sunset. It appeared to be a bright, steady light moving higher in the heavens and then descending. It was observed for about 20 minutes until it disappeared. This was observed by the reporting party at Bucyrus, Ohio.

b. On the night of June 30th, about 9:30 P.M., I also saw another object appear in eastern Ohio above Bellevue. This object appeared to be a bright, steady light moving higher in the heavens and then descending. It was observed for about 15 minutes until it disappeared. This was observed by the reporting party at Bellevue, Ohio.

c. It is my understanding that these objects were also observed by other, reliable individuals at the time and locations mentioned above, and I submit this report in accordance with Air Force regulations.

PROJECT 10073 RECORD

TELETYPE
REPORT-29 TECH. INT. CENTER
CLEVELAND OHIO 6 SEPT. 1961

SUMMARY:
HAVING NOTIFIED MAJOR JAMES, AT 7:00 P.M. 6 SEPT 61, THAT I WOULD BE ON ROAD THAT NIGHT TO WORK DETAILS OF THIS CASE. I ARRIVED 7:15 P.M. ON SITE.

THE FIRST OBJECT NOTICED WAS ON AUG. 24TH AT 11:10 P.M. WHILE DRIVING FROM BUCYRUS TO BELLEVUE, OHIO. THIS WAS A GOLDEN COLOR WITH A TAIL THAT WOULD DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR BRIGHTEST. OBJECT ROSE UP AND HOVERED THEN HEADED NORTH AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER ANOTHER OBJECT APPEARED IN THE WESTERN SKY, MOVING SOUTH. IT WAS BRIGHT WHITE AND SEEMED TO HAVE A TRAIL BEHIND IT. IT PASSED OVER A GROUP OF TREES AND I COULDN'T SEE IT ANYMORE.

I CHECKED THE SKIES FOR THE NEXT 10-15 MINUTES AND OBSERVED NOTHING FURTHER.

ON SEPT 1, AT 2:45 A.M., NOTIFIED A BRIGHT OBJECT ABOUT 1/2 MILE WEST OF MY LOCATION. IT SEEMED TO BE MOVING VERY FAST AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS.

ON SEPT. 2ND, OBSERVED TWO OBJECTS DESCRIBED AS ABOUT 75-100 FEET WIDE, SHAPED LIKE A HALF MOON, BLUISH IN COLOR. THESE PASSED OVER THE FARM WHERE I WAS OBSERVING AT AN ESTIMATED HEIGHT OF 500 FT. AND WERE TRAVELING ABOUT 150 MPH. THEY WERE SEEN FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES.

ON SEPT. 3RD, AT ABOUT 8:30 P.M., OBSERVED 3 OBJECTS, BRIGHT WHITE IN COLOR, TRAVELING IN A TRIANGULAR FORMATION ABOUT 500 FT. HIGH. THESE WERE VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 5-6 MINUTES.

ON EACH OF THE 5 OR 6 TIMES THESE OBJECTS WERE SEEN, THEY ALWAYS APPEARED TO BE COMING FROM THE SAME GENERAL DIRECTION AND RETURNING THERE. 
AT NO TIME WAS I ABLE TO GET A GOOD PHOTOGRAPH AS THE OBJECTS WERE ALWAYS AT SUCH A HEIGHT AND DISTANCE. 
I ESTIMATE THAT DURING THIS PERIOD ALL THREE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED A TOTAL OF 15 TIMES.

The image appears to contain a drawing of various shapes, including a sun-like symbol and an oval shape, along with some text describing the witness's observation. There does not appear to be a photograph present in this document.

Text extracted from the document:

This was called to report that an object in the sky was observed to pass over the trees that border a Buehyrus & Bellevue, Ohio, Airport. It was described as being about 8-10 ft. in diameter, luminous or glowing, and moving in a slow or steady speed at an altitude of about 500 ft. It was observed for about 45-60 seconds. The object was estimated to be about 3 miles from the observers' location.

The report states that two of the witness's daughters had also observed the object and that they would appreciate hearing from you as to what that object was. The shapes drawn were to indicate the shape of the objects seen.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

1. Reference the attached copy of a letter from a principal of a school in reporting unidentified flying objects.
2. The first object viewed by the witness was probably due to atmospheric conditions and the slight star stirring. The object responsible for the third sighting was undoubtedly Venus.
3. The object sighted in the initial experience has been reported to AFD on previous occasions and seems to be due to the identity of this object has been reached; however, it is suggested to be identical.

Bellevue, Ohio
November 18, 1960

The capsule came into view about 10:30 p.m. and was visible for about 15 minutes. The object was a bright silver color and the shape was round. It appeared to be about the size of a large basketball when viewed from the ground.

The object was moving very slowly and quite low over the ground, only about a hundred feet or so up. It gave off a bright glow but there were no flashing lights or other unusual features. The object appeared to be solid and not transparent.

After a few minutes, the object began to ascend slowly and then moved off to the east at a rather rapid speed, disappearing from view within a few seconds. There was no sound associated with the object at any time.

There were two witnesses to the event, the writer and his wife. Careful observation failed to reveal any aircraft, balloon, or other conventional explanation for the object. It did not appear to be a satellite or any other known type of aircraft.

The writer is a reasonably careful observer who has seen many airplanes, satellites, and other aerial phenomena. This object was unlike any he has ever seen before and does not fit the description of any known type of aircraft.

Text from the document:

All of this is greately exaggerated. This looked to be some sort of reflection from the cars interior. The objects seemed to be of usual size and nature, and did seem to move in odd patterns, but this could have been caused by movement of the car, or reflections from the windows.

All of this is not true of this case. One of the chief reasons is that these would not show up on radar. Persons are not competent to judge the speed and distance and size of objects in the sky. Things usually appear much larger and faster than they actually are. The object could have been a satellite, a aircraft, or some other natural phenomenon which the witnesses misinterpreted.

The object did not do anything unusual, so I fail to see how this is of any real significance scientifically. Strange reports of this nature are very common and can usually be attributed to natural explanations after investigation. Therefore, I see no real evidence of anything extraordinary in this case.

UFO REPORT (Major Coleman)

1. References the attached copy of a letter to ATIC (FTD) from Miss  who is reporting several UFO's seen by her.

2. The objects sighted were viewed by the witness probably due to atmospheric inversion of Venus. The objects described by Miss  appear to be planets. The sightings themselves are understandable and explainable.

3. The objects sighted by Miss  in her final appearance have been reported to FTD (Aeronautical Intelligence). Identity of this object has been erased; however, it is suspected to be under further investigation.

"There were a total of 3 sightings reported in the Bucyrus and Bellevue, Ohio area on 6-8-61. Two of the sightings were reported within 15-20 minutes of each other. The witness in the first sighting reported seeing a very bright light that appeared to be around 4000 feet in the air. The light hovered for 3 to 4 minutes and then disappeared. The witness in the second sighting reported seeing 3 very brilliant and pulsating lights that appeared to be around 1000 feet in the air. The lights were observed for 3 to 4 minutes and then disappeared. The third sighting was reported later in the day and the witness described seeing a very bright light that appeared to be around 5000 feet in the air. The light hovered for 2 to 3 minutes and then disappeared. No further information is available on the third sighting."

The alleged unidentified flying object was observed by Mr. and Mrs. Claude Greer, residents of Bucyrus, Ohio, on June 8, 1961. According to their report, the object was first noticed at 9:30 p.m. in the southern sky and was observed for approximately 45 minutes. The object was described as a round, lighted object that moved slowly across the sky. No sound was heard. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of about 2,000 feet. The witnesses stated that the object appeared to be metallic in construction and emitted a dim, reddish-orange glow. After about 45 minutes, the object disappeared from view, apparently behind some trees.

DEAR MR. ******,

YOUR THOMAS LOPEZ addressed to the Technical Intelligence Center of this office. 

Regarding the description of the sightings seen by your friend, and the details as given are probably the most comprehensive I have seen in connection with this type of report. The location, time, duration, direction of movement, description of the object, and the color and apparent size in relation to known objects are all very helpful in analyzing the report.

I hope that this information is helpful.

1. Forwarding the attached copy of a letter from Lt Col __________ regarding the first object viewed by the witness was probably due to an abnormal refraction phenomena.
2. The second object viewed by the same witness on the same night is considered physically real and unexplained. This object produced an unusual light beam and was the brighter of the two.
3. The final experience has been reported to FTD on a previous occasion. To date no firm conclusion as to the nature of this phenomenon is warranted. It is suggested to be further investigated.

November 29, 1961.

Commanding Intelligence Center,
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
DAYTON, OHIO.

Gentlemen:

I have analyzed the following information from a flight of Bucyrus, Ohio, who tells me she has not informed you of it. I was told of it by my daughter and had I not brought it to your attention I don't know what would happen.

"On September 13th I was taking my daughter home from school and all of a sudden an object came into sight which was brighter than the sun and emitted no heat. It hung there for about 45 seconds and then began to move out of sight in a northeasterly direction very rapidly. It left no trail and made no sound. It was about 6 feet in diameter and rather shaped like a saucer with a small dome on top.

"A little later I saw another object, similar in shape, brightness and action. It was only a small object but did not have the parent and did not leave any trail.

"After a while, I saw a third bright object rising through the outer branches of another tree. This looked to be about 6 feet high and had a ring of lights around the outside. This object moved rapidly across the sky and disappeared.

"All three of these objects were moving higher in the heavens and moving at a high rate of speed. They were very bright and colored and at a 45' angle in the sky and appeared to be about a block and a half away.

"This makes 5 objects that I've seen in the sky this year ago last August."

This report does not seem too reliable and often does occur, but we would like to track the frequency of such reports if possible. We would appreciate hearing from this observer again if she sees any more of these objects.

Text extracted from the document:

23 December 1951

Your recent letter to the Aeronautics Electrical Intelligesce Center of the Aireraft Warning Service was received. Your letter has been referred to this office for appropriate action.

The object viewed and reported by you is probably due to some astronomical or meteorological phenomenon, and not an aircraft or unidentified flying object. The ATIC has investigated many such reports and found them to be of natural origin. The fact that the object was observed for some time is not conclusive evidence that it was something other than a natural phenomenon.

As to any final conclusion as to the identity of the light observed, we are unable to make a definite determination from the information you have provided. We must, therefore, conclude that this information is inconclusive.

1. As requested, please find attached copy of a report to ATIC (AFSC) from Mr....
regarding several UFOs seen by him.

2. Recent sighting of several UFOs, probably due to phosphorescent meteors or other phenomenon, has prompted this report. The objects of light were at a high altitude and their movement was erratic, according to the report.

3. The object sighted by Mr. ... in her final observation has been in the past the subject of considerable controversy. The validity of this report has been questioned; however, it is supported by the statement of an independent witness, according to the report.
