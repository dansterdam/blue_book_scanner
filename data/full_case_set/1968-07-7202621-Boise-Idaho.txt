TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

INFORMATION WHICH COULD LEAD TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE WITNESS IS NOT ACCURATELY COVERED IN THIS REPORT. THIS IS DONE TO PROTECT THE IDENTITY OF THE WITNESS.

I really don't know much about what happened other than what I've put in this report. The whole thing seemed so incredible and unexpected that I'm still somewhat dazed by it all. As I mentioned, I was driving along the highway about 10 miles east of Boise, Idaho on the evening of July 7, 1968 when the incident occurred. It was around 10:00 p.m. and the sky was clear. I was just driving along minding my own business when suddenly I noticed a bright light in the sky off to my right. At first I thought it might be an airplane, but as I watched it, I realized it was moving much faster and much more erratically than any aircraft I've ever seen.

The object was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed and making very sharp, right-angle turns that I don't believe any conventional aircraft could make. It seemed to be silvery in color and was giving off a very bright, almost blinding light. I watched it for 2-3 minutes as it maneuvered across the sky, then it simply disappeared from view, as if it had been turned off or had accelerated to a speed beyond my ability to see it. 

The whole experience left me shaken and puzzled. I've never seen anything like it before and I can't explain what I saw. It definitely did not appear to be any kind of normal aircraft. I've reported what I saw to the authorities, but I don't know if they will be able to provide any answers. I guess I'll just have to wonder about it along with everyone else.

INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFC)

This investigation was conducted by Sgt Theodore C. Ackley, Security Police Squadron, Mountain Home AFB, Idaho.

On 7 August 1968, William M. Cunnene, Boise Police Department, Boise, Idaho was contacted by the Security Police Squadron, Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, regarding an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The original report from Mr. Cunnene indicates that at approximately 9:00 p.m. (MDT) on 6 August 1968, he and his wife observed a bright light in the sky moving in various directions. He stated that the light appeared to be round and about the size of a business envelope held at arm's length. Other police officers observed the same phenomena; however, these officers could not identify the object.

Attempts were made to contact Mr. Cunnene at his residence to obtain further details, but he was not available. A telephone call was made to the Boise Police Department to schedule an appointment for an interview, but no one was available.

REPORT FROM THE U.S. WEATHER BUREAU AND THE BOISE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT

Mr. K.S. Harvey and Mr. J.T. Todey, U.S. Weather Bureau furnished the following information:

1. Weather conditions on 6 August 1968 were generally clear, with visibility unlimited. There was a smoke layer in the area, but this did not interfere with the visual observation of the object.
