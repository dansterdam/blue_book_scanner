ATIC Comment:
Confidentiality warrants here, that we can mention details per request, cannot be discussed openly. Exact details (40' to 50' diam) given in report here. Also some lights on the back, also lights turned along with man's attitude who saw it. UFO case seen years (4 men ). Could place near car, but it moved around some. Several officers have confirmed this fact.

Prob. Astro event? (Venus) WITH INFLUENCING (from recent local case)
