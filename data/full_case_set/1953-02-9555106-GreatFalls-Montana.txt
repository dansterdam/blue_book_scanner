1. On the night of 25 February 1953 Lieutenant Peter Marquart, 3/Sgt Dwyer M. Montana, were returning to their base in a car along Highway 87 from Shelby, Montana, were observing an investigation of a reported crash of an unidentified object near Dodson on the night of 22 February 1953.

2. At 2000 hours MST, they noticed a very bright, glowing object in the sky which they estimate to be at an altitude of 1,000 to 5,000 feet above the terrain. This light appeared to be at an altitude of some 1,000 to 5,000 feet above the terrain. This light maneuvered in a manner similar to bursting a parachute flare. After about 10 to 15 minutes the light went out and reappeared, descending rapidly to a very low attitude, and then climbed rapidly at great speed. This light exhibited no trail but continued to drop, resembling a parachute flare. At this point about half to the object had appeared to disintegrate completely.

SPECIALLY if it develops that the unknown object appeared in one specific relative position over a period of time. Also, advise informal check into Mr. Lee's character, local reputation, etc. to be sure that the sightings are not the result of a "crackpot". 
ADVISE Mr. Lee that Air Force is taking an interest in his sightings. FOUR USAF Technical Information Sheets are being forwarded your organization, one of which should be filled out by Mr. Lee. This and are an AF Form 112 consolidating a report of the 3 individual sightings which we are now making to ATIC per AFR 200-2 as the official case file.

INFO: AF HQ USAF WASH DC 171312 FEB 53
FROM: APWI-STAN-5-8 FOR 171215Z AIR TRANS NO. HQ
AFIC has been advised by D/I 19 USAF that your organization has received 3 separate reports on 25 Feb 53 and 5 and 6 Mar 53 of an unidentified aerial object sighted at Great Falls by one of your observers. AFIC advises the following in handling the incidents: 1) Advise Mr. Lee to determine the approximate altitude and elevation readings in each case, or at least its general position in the sky. 2) Were there other observers or witnesses? 3) Check local radar facilities to determine if they recorded anything unusual at the dates and times of sightings. 4) Check local weather balloon launches as a possible cause for one or more of the sightings. Although 2 out of the 3 sightings are in the daytime, briefs indicate there are sometimes visible during the day. AFIC has caused many incidents in the USAF and AFIC advises that a local astronomer be contacted on this possibility.

Brilliantly illuminated, it approached at tremendous speed in an almost straight-line flight. When it reached a spot about 5 miles from the observers, its intensity and magnitude increased about ten times, resembling a brilliant flash and its intensity and magnitude increased about ten times, resembling a brilliant flash and its intensity and magnitude increased about ten times. The sound was heard.
