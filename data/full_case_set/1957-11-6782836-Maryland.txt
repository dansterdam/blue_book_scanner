This officer immediately called the Provost Marshal's Office and was informed that Chief of Police, Crownsville, Md., had notified the Military Police at Fort George G. Meade that an unidentified object had been sighted and that employees had been alerted and the object was observed to descend into the area at approximately 500-2000 feet floating to earth. The object disintegrated as it descended and appeared to be a bright light. Though no pieces were breaking away from the body of the object, its disintegration caused a disruption of the light and drew attention to the area. A small portion was obtained by M/Sgt. Slate, and said sample was forwarded to the United States Army, ATTN: ATISD-0, (Capt Staples).

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document describes an incident that occurred on November 13, 1957, where a Captain Dugas was contacted by a Chief of Police in Maryland regarding an unidentified flying object. The document details the events that followed, including the Captain's interactions with the military police and the investigation that took place.

ST.4T2MENT 
14 November 1957

At approximately 0935 hours, 13 November 57, Captain Dugas, Operation Officer of the 1707th Meteorological Squadron, Ft George E Meade, Maryland, called me telephonically that the Chief of Police in 
Centreville, Maryland has requested his assistance in investigating a flying object which he, the Chief of Police, had observed hovering over the town of Centreville at approximately 0900 hours. Captain Dugas stated that the Chief of Police requested a military police car to be sent to Centreville since he was unable to handle the situation by himself and asked if we would be willing to
provide this support. I checked with Major Snyder, Capt. 22, who directed me to go with the Military Police. Captain Sean asked me to check with the Operations Center at Ft Meade, since I would require some written authority to proceed. I complied and was issued written authority to State Hospital.

Upon arrival at the State Hospital, at approximately 1020 hours,  OC J I interviewed the personnel and ascertained the Chief of Police of Centreville, Maryland, a second eyewitness, had been brought to the hospital.

13 November 1957, the Chief of Police stated that shortly before 0900 hours, he heard a popping noise, and saw an object which he estimated to be between 30 and 50 feet in diameter, at a height of approximately 1000 feet. The Chief watched the object for between 5 to 10 minutes, as it remained stationary. It finally disappeared by speeding up and going straight up out of sight. 

At the State Hospital at approximately 0900 hours, the Chief stated the object was about the size of the state hospital at approximately 1000 feet. At the State Hospital, we attempted to pick up pieces of the object with his fingers, but the pieces disintegrated immediately. We salvaged a few pieces and placed them on a piece of paper and placed them in the box and gave him brief details of the incident. Major Snyder showed remarks to Colonel Enough Deputy Post Commander.

GFC Freeman and I picked up the remnants on a piece of paper and placed them in a paper clip. We returned to the Psychical Warfare Division, and turned the material over to the Technical Intelligence Division, Wright Patterson Air Force Base.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Approximately 1520 hours, the undersigned, the Commanding Officer, Montebello State Mental Hospital, was informed of an incident which had occurred in the hospital grounds, and which had been reported to the local police.

At approximately 1710 hours, upon arrival at the hospital, contact was made with Captain Barrington, of the area where the unknown object was supposed to have landed.

Post Chemical and XD Tests checked the area thoroughly and met with negative results. No physical evidence of this event remaining at that time.

After talking with Captain Barrington, it was determined that two employees of the hospital had seen this object. A description was obtained, and it was learned that a third individual, who was unknown, was also present at that time.

The following information was obtained at this time:

1. Object was first sighted at approximately 0900 hours by Chief of Police of State Mental Hospital and three employees of the same institution.

2. Object was noted as unusual, resembling a luminescent metallic, silvery globe, about 1500 to 2000 feet and appeared to be hovering over an area behind the hospital, and when it reached the ground, there was a dust cloud arise, and then it took off upwards at a high rate of speed, and disappeared from sight.

3. Persons who had sighted the UFO and further stated that they were always trustworthy.

At approximately 1800 hours the undersigned contacted Captain Barrington from the hospital and informed him of the results. Captain Barrington informed me that they knew this was an unknown object, and have released no press releases from this responsibility, which I did at that time.
