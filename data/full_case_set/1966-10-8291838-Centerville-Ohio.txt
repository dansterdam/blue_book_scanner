The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or illustration. The sketch appears to be a compass rose and a diagram showing the motion and position of an unidentified object in the sky.

Extracted text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 13 JUNE 1966 

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

This was when I was riding my bike to scout and watched it and saw that it was a large light on top - while we were riding down the highway (route 48) I could see it changing color and blink on and off while it was hovering there. When we got to the scout meeting it was still there - some of the boys called the air base camp and reported it out but we weren't able to determine what it was - some said it too but whether they were kidding started the meeting on time.

The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely part of a report from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation into unidentified flying objects.

Text from the document:

"They" said it was a star.
(Most stars don't wiggle and jerk around though.) (Same said it was a satellite, but they don't move fast and forth, and change color, and come and go so low as we can see the shiny stuff that they're made out of.) After awhile my brother went out and we couldn't see it anymore.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, specifically a letter dated 25 October 1966 from Victor Quintwilla, Jr., Major, USAF, Chief, Project Blue Book, addressed to someone in Centerville, Ohio.

The text in the document is as follows:
