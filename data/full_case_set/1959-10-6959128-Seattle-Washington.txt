The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document with handwritten text.

The handwritten text on the page reads:

"RELATIVE: (Continued) 
The temperature inversion which probably produced the mirage was certainly 
responsible for the mirage and making the targets on radar. The
others when they were visually observed say the targets on Radar.
The image inversion with the mirage effects both visual and radar is 
the cause of this seeming-

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a UFO analysis sheet from Project Blue Book, dated October 2, 1959, with the location listed as Seattle, Washington.

The text in the document is as follows:

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Seattle, Washington
Date: 2 Oct 1959
Hour: (2) 2708202
WX: Clear - fog moved in 1 1/2 hours after sighting.
Description: Five objects tracked on radar, several others not reported. Usually appeared in pairs. Round, size of quarter, white and blue with flickering light. Weak blip on radar. Faded after approximately three hours. Flight patterns were erratic.
Direction or Motion: Faded in area of observation.
Satellite: (ARGCN-4F3, Phone 62219)
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc):
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1):
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc):
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc:
Other: Possible mirage
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Probable good.
Analysis and Conclusions: The weather conditions at the time of this sighting indicate that the objects were not normal aircraft or astronomical phenomena. The erratic flight patterns and the fact that the objects faded in the area of observation suggest that they were not satellites or other natural phenomena. The observers appear to be reliable and their report is consistent. It is therefore possible that the objects observed were of an unidentified nature.
