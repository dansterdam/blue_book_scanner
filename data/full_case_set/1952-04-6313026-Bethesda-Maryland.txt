APPENDIX VII 
Bethesda, Maryland - 18 April 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
Four civilians reported that they observed a V-formation of from 7 to 9 light-revolving objects over Bethesda, Maryland, at 0130 EST on 18 April 1952.

The included angle of the formation or "V" was estimated to be 40°. There were slight changes in the speed and three to five craft changed to be orange-yellow, circular, and to occupy 15 percent of the total length of the formation.

The formation, or object, was first sighted at an elevation of about 60° in the south and disappeared behind some trees at 60° in the north. The total time of observation was about four to eight seconds and there was no sound.

All four observers were interrogated and their accounts of the incident were similar. They stated that they had not seen the Life Magazine article describing the Lubbock incident prior to the sighting.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
The possibility of jet aircraft in the area was checked. A similar report of light formations did turn out to be very probably a B-45 type aircraft, however, no jets were known to be in the area at the time of this incident.

III. CONCLUSIONS
None.
