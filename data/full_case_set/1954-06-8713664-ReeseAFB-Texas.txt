SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE SEEN UFO's
Dr. R. Percy Wilkins, a Fellow of the Roy- al Astronomical Society, England, and a former man authority. (Deceased - 1960)
Incident: June 18, 1954 - Dr. Wilkins was a passenger on a plane flying between Charleston, S.C. and Atlanta, Ga. Very brilliant, oval-shaped objects moving very swiftly were seen from the plane. He estimated their size to be around 4 to 5 feet in diameter. He considered them to be interplanetary in nature and suggested they were with the color of burnished copper but as they moved against the sunlight, their color was gray.
All this was observed within the white cloud. All was over in 3 minutes. - Dr. Wilkins.
