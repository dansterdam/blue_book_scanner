LETTER

September 6, 1966

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object 

Introduction

On the night of August 27, 1966, Mr. Gene Gwinner, a rural mail carrier residing near Gwinner, North Dakota, reported sighting a bright light in the sky. Mr. Gwinner pursued the light in his vehicle and subsequently discovered a crater-like depression in the ground approximately 18 inches in diameter and 6 inches deep.

Detailed Description of the Incident

According to Mr. Gwinner's account, at approximately 10:00 p.m. on August 27, 1966, he was driving his mail route when he observed a bright, stationary light in the sky. Estimating the light to be about 50 feet above the ground, Mr. Gwinner decided to investigate further. He drove his vehicle towards the light, which began to move away from him at a high rate of speed. 

Mr. Gwinner followed the light for approximately 5 miles before it disappeared from view. He then stopped his vehicle and began searching the area on foot. After walking about 100 yards, Mr. Gwinner discovered a crater-like depression in the ground, measuring roughly 18 inches in diameter and 6 inches in depth. 

The ground around the depression appeared to be disturbed, with scattered vegetation and soil. Mr. Gwinner did not observe any other unusual phenomena in the area.

Conclusion

Based on the information provided, this incident appears to be a sighting of an unidentified flying object, with the subsequent discovery of a physical trace on the ground. While the exact nature of the object and the cause of the depression remain unclear, the case warrants further investigation. Additional information and analysis may provide more insight into the events of August 27, 1966, in Gwinner, North Dakota.

This report covers the results of the investigation of an unident-1 fied flying object sighting reported from Gwinner, North Dakota on 6 September 1966. The
reporting witness is Sergeant Elmer J. Gasser, stationed at Horace, N.D.

According to Sergeant Gasser, he observed the following:
At approximately 1915 hours on 6 September 1966 he was driving about 3 miles
north of Gwinner, N.D. on N.D. Highway 32 when he observed a bright light in the
sky to the south. The object seemed to be hovering and moving erratically. He drove
on a gravel road west toward the object and stopped when he was approximately
1/2 mile from it. He then observed the object at close range and described it as
cigar-shaped, with a bright white light that seemed to pulse. The object was approxi-
mately 30 feet in length and 6-8 feet in diameter. As he watched, the object suddenly
accelerated upward and disappeared from sight.

Sergeant Gasser immediately reported the sighting to the local sheriff's office.
Upon investigation the sheriff found no physical evidence. An Air Force investiga-
tion team was dispatched to the site, but likewise found no evidence of the reported
sighting.

CASE NO. 66-78879
INVESTIGATIVE REPORT
Date: 6 September 1966
Location: Gwinner, North Dakota
Witness: Mr. John Jones

On 6 September 1966, at approximately 1920 hours, Mr. John Jones was driving on Highway 27 near Gwinner, North Dakota, when he observed a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to be descending rapidly and Mr. Jones pulled his vehicle to the side of the road to observe the object more closely.

Mr. Jones stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape and was emitting a brilliant white light. As the object descended, it slowed and appeared to hover approximately 30 feet above the ground. Mr. Jones then observed what he described as a "beam of light" emanating from the underside of the object, which illuminated the ground below.

After hovering for several minutes, the object then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. Mr. Jones immediately stopped his vehicle and went to the area where the object had hovered. He discovered several impressions in the ground, as well as some scorched vegetation.

The case was investigated by Project Blue Book and the Air Force determined that the sighting was of an unidentified flying object. No further information is available regarding the nature or origin of the object observed by Mr. Jones.
