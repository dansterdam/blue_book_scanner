U. S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

My observation in this connection was the following:  On September 11, 1953 came personally the report that a giant rock near Joshua Tree, California, was observed. This rock appeared to be about 7 feet in height and about 5 feet in diameter. I think that the observer thought the above impression as to the size of the rock could not be precise, since he did not have any comparison object near the rock. Since I wrote the above letter, the observer has several other friends. Many of them observed this same object and under virtually the same conditions as the original observer. In addition, several other individuals observed the same object under slightly different conditions as well.

NAMES: College of Superior Vision 
ADDRESS: Deep Rock Valley, California
TO REPORT: Sighting of circular flying craft
DETAILS: On 12 March 1953, a witness reportedly observed a "saucer-shaped" flying object over Deep Rock Valley, California. The object was described as being approximately 30 feet in diameter and emitting a faint blue glow. The witness claimed the object hovered for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing. Membership in the organization is confidential, however.
REMARKS: The witness has written a book entitled "Book entitled CELESTIAL VISITORS" which has reportedly received wide acceptance. He claims to have had several other encounters with similar objects in the past.
FILES: The file of the College of Superior Vision remains classified. Further details on the organization and its activities are not available to the general public.

The text in the document is as follows:

JANUARY 24, 1953
GIANT ROCK AIRPORT
JOSHUA TREE, CALIFORNIA

Air Force Intelligence 
Attention: Field
Dear Sirs:

On the afternoon of January 22, 1953, at about 1:55 p.m., what appeared to be a B-36 bomber, flew over here in an easterly direction. As it passed Yucca Valley, California, it apparently stopped and hovered as it was approximately 1,000 feet in the air and seemed motionless. 

The object was approximately 60 to 70 feet in diameter, silver in color, and circular in shape. It stayed motionless for about 2 minutes. Then it suddenly took off at an extremely high speed, climbing to an altitude of about 13,000 feet and also leaving a vapor trail. It went about 1 mile to the right of it's vapor trail when it disappeared from view.

I have had my observation verified twice. Several witnesses from Joshua Tree have contacted me and verified their observation which coincides with my report.

The entire sighting lasted about 2 minutes. On the right of the bomber and behind it was a smaller vapor trail. This smaller trail led from the bomber into the large vapor trail. When the object took off, the smaller vapor trail disappeared.

I just certainly saw this object and it could have been a bomber with a peculiar observation. But, it disappeared at such a high rate of speed that I doubt it could have been a bomber. Certainly no aircraft that I know of could have performed that maneuver.

Sincerely yours,
(Redacted)
Giant Rock Airport
