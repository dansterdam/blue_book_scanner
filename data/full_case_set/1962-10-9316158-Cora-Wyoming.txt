It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 to 1969. The document is a Project 10073 Record Card that provides details about a UFO sighting on October 9, 1962 near Cora, Wyoming.

The object was described as a bright illumination and mounted movement, consistently described by the observer at several homes as on several occasions. The observer does no wish to submit this report: it is believed that all local efforts to identify the object have been exhausted.

Investigators Note: Although the observer believes that the object No. 2 mentioned in this report was a subsequent information to have some connection with Object No. 2, which is unidentified.

UFO SIGHTING
Greenriver, Wyoming
22 October 1962

Observers: Mr._____, age 44
Cora(17), Wyoming & Salt Lake City, Utah
Mr._____ manages and leases the land and buildings owned by his family. The number operation is manufacturing.

Mr._____, age 66, Cora(17), Wyoming
Location: Cora(17), Wyoming about 200 air miles from Casper, Wyoming.  
Time: Shortly after 1700. Observer looked at watch at 5:30 and estimated that the object had appeared about 10 minutes previously. Dusk, not yet dark but not light.
Course: Object #1: First observed about 12 miles up Greenriver Canyon & 1 turned or up to about down Greenriver Valley. It appeared to be hovering or stationary & estimate altitude of 9,000 feet as the Greenriver River in Greenriver Valley. It appeared in the northwest and moved northeast and northerly. It moved south, then ascended very slowly to estimated altitude of 19,000 feet as the object appeared to be the east and traveled west.
The observer was in a home situated.
The object was highly illuminated and estimated to be between 11,000 and 12,000 feet in diameter. The object remained semi-stationary for a period of about 5 minutes and then grew brighter and came nearer to where the observers were located. The object through field glasses appeared to be circular in shape with a luminous border and wings was discernible. The aircraft apparently was burning all illuminating and had no sound. When the object was within an approximate distance of about 1 mile, it then appeared to be the size of an automobile. As the object approached, it appeared to be the size of an automobile. As the object approached, it appeared to tilt slightly and the luminosity appeared to diminish. The object appeared to be the size of an R-10 transport (as used by the military) and continued on a northwest course. After a period of time, the object appeared to be the size of a star and disappeared to the southwest.

There is no photograph or image present in this document. The provided text appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, describing an unidentified aerial phenomenon observed in Cora, Wyoming.

Very shortly after the first object disappeared over the ranch property, a second object was observed moving further to the East about five ground miles down the canyon. This second object was more brilliantly illuminated than the first and appeared to be about twice the width of the object and surrounded the object on all sides. The object remained motionless for a period of time, then it moved slowly for any known aircraft, and very steadily across the sky. The light was not unlike that of the first object, although somewhat brighter. The light of the second object was not steady but appeared to pulsate or flash. There was no trail or exhaust visible. The total time of sighting was one to two minutes, and the second object disappeared over the hills. There was no sound. Attention was drawn to the objects because of their lights.

Observers reported the first object to be below the highest point of elevation and 10,000 to 12,000 feet in range. The second object was not the color or shape of any star and the observers are convinced that it was man-made (but could not be determined as an aircraft). They realize the brightness and silhouette of the first object could have caused the distortion of the second. To transverse the area, the observers expressed the fact that the time of day could have prohibited identification of the object and that the altitude was so high that the object was not visible the following morning. There is no record of any unusual aerial phenomena in the area.
