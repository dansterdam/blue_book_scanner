I while stating on my examination seemed to observe a white object in the open country and appeared to be hovering. I observed this object very closely and could not be described as any other thing. I think my observation of this object is accurate and cannot be easily explained away. And I cannot explain the nature of the object I observed.

I would appreciate a sincere and careful inquiry by competent authorities regarding this thing that I observed for a considerable time and which does not conform to any ordinary flying object. Whatever my observation was, it certainly appears to be quite unusual and I would welcome any intelligent investigation of this matter by your organization. I hope you will give this matter your careful consideration.
