The image contains a diagram with instructions for drawing the motion of a observed object or objects. There is also a compass-like illustration in the image. However, the image does not contain any photographs.

Transcribed text from the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you see at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

2b. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and use an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, which is a collection of reports on unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings investigated by the United States Air Force.

The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or survey form with questions related to a UFO sighting. The page is labeled "Page 7" and contains questions 34 and 35, which are asking for the date the questionnaire was completed and for any additional information the witness felt was pertinent to their sighting but not adequately covered in the specific questions.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT 

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: BURBANK, CALIFORNIA
DATE: 12 JULY 1965

PHOTOGRAPHY
A: NEGATIVE (CINEMASCOPE FRAME)
QUALITY: GOOD

1. PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order 65-93 from Major L. J. Quintanilla, Tr. "BLUE BOOK" to analyze one negative (filmstrip frame) taken at Burbank, California on 12 July, 1965.

2. ANALYSIS: Mr. and Mrs. KRON (initials) assisted in the analysis of the negative. The light intensities of these objects are much greater than the sky background indicating they are in close proximity to the camera. The objects appear to be two distinct entities close to each other. The light intensities of these objects are much greater than the sky background indicating they are in close proximity to the camera. This condition is reported to have existed only momentarily and the objects apparently moved on and disappeared. Assuming a haze condition existed at the time of photography, the unidentified objects could have seemed brighter than the sky background.

3. CONCLUSION: The two unidentified objects are probably a double image of reflected sunlight off some object in front of the windshield, possibly the tip of a vapor trail, onto the windshield. The identical double image could be caused by a reflection from the front and rear of the windshield glass.

Dear Mr. [redacted],

The negative which you submitted to the Air Force for analysis is returned.

The double that in the prints could be caused by reflection and distortion. The selection has been examined for any evidence of the unusual object as reported. A copy of the photo analysis report is enclosed for your information.

Thank you for submitting your report to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
