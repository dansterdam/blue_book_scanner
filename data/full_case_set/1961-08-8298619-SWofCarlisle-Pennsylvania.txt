The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document, specifically a letter written on August 10, 1961 from someone in Carlisle, Pennsylvania to the Chief Inspector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The text of the document is as follows:

COPY
Carlisle, Pennsylvania
August 10, 1961

Chief Inspector 
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

Our company possesses a guest house on a mountain top Southwest of Carlisle. A group of us were holding a meeting, August 8. It was warm and we were sitting on an uncovered veranda.

As we looked to the Northwest, we observed a bright light moving rapidly, but in a swerving course Northwest lattitudinally. It moved in an east and then a northwestern direction and disappeared behind the trees.

The night was clear, stars were plainly visible. The North star provided a sense of direction.

As we followed the course of the light, it seemed to move a bit erratically from side to side and on a few occasions seemed to jump ahead. Though all of us observed these various movements, I recognize they could be attributed to impaired visual conditions or eye concentrations.

I have been at a loss as to whether to report this and, if so, to whom. I would hate to appear you that the light observed was not an airplane. With the sky as full of "exotic objects", one hesitates to report any observation today.

Sincerely yours,

COPY
