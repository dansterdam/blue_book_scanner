PORT FIRST THOUGHT OBJECT WAS AIRCRAFT ON FINAL APPROACH WITH LANDING LIGHTS ON. DIFFERENCES IN SIZE ESTIMATION COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED FROM THE FACT THAT INDICATED AT NIGHT WITH NO VISIBLE REFERENCES TO GAUGE THE DISTANCE AND SIZE CORRECTLY.
THIS OBJECT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN A SATELLITE REENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE; OR A METEORITE. SINCE THE OBJECT DID NOT MOVE AT A RAPID RATE THERE IS A GOOD POSSIBILITY THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN A WEATHER BALLOON. NEITHER CAN BE PROVEN BECAUSE NO PHYSICAL EVEIDENCE HAS BEEN FOUND, AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS OF ANYTHING FALLING.
