Subject: First hand UFO report 1963 - sighting
March 1966 -

Gentlemen:

The attached is a UFO sighting report for your files.

Bright light streaked the extremely clear and object.
At its overhead and low horizon. Approached the Ground. 
Washington and San Fernando [down?] better ? but I do recall the other details for better than the date.

I have delayed this report purposefully (unsuccessfully) to have an occasion call for an answer on the phenomenon because delayed because of the confidentiality of the Air Force is studying the same time.

The report is self-explanatory. I would like to add the object moved quite slowly and changed from a point source to a larger irregular shaped light before disappearing below the horizon. I do have some additional details but do not wish to provide them at this time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

There is no visible photograph in the provided image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document.

Since the image does not contain a human face, I will proceed to produce the text output from the document:

SPECIAL REPORT (CONTINUED)

SPECIAL PHENOMENON CONTINUED
- AT FINAL BREAK-UP TRACK-
MENTS ACROSS SKY NOT LIKE MAIN 
OBJECT - BUT WENT OUT (DISINTEGRATED)
& EXTINGUISHED AFTER APPROX. 
10° ARC.

WITNESSES: NONE. (CALLED WIFE
& CHILDREN - BUT THEY DID
NO WANT TO GO OUTSIDE IN QUICK 
SHOWER TIME.)

SOUND & ODORS: - NONE. (NOTHING
HEARD SPECIALLY)

LATER ACTIVITY: NONE. (IT WATCHED
FOR ANOTHER 1/2 HR. THEN "LISTENED"
ALL OVER AREA TO NEIGHBORS OR BLAZE
FOR CRASH, BUT THERE WAS NONE.)

COMMENT: I KNOW THIS WOULD SEEM LIKE A METEORITE AT 
FIRST ANALYSIS; BUT THE OBJECT GLOWED AND SEEMED 
OF THE FINAL ODD BREAK-UP NATURE THAT THE WEATHER 
BUREAU SAYS THEY CANNOT EXPLAIN ON ANYTHING THEY HAVE 
ALSO, IT JUST SEEMED WAY TOO SLOW FOR ANY 
METEORITE FALL.
