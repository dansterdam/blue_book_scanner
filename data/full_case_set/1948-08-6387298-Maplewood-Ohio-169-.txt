Investigations by this headquarters reveal that a synoptic
weather balloon could have been at the location where sightings
were reported in the following two incidents. In compiling this
info consideration was given to the wind direction and speed at
the surface and aloft at the scheduled time of balloon release, and
the location of the nearest weather station making balloon obser-
vations.

SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

TO: Chief, Air Weather Service,
     Andrews Air Force Base,
     Washington 25, D. C.
     ATTN: DCS

1. Project "SIGN" is responsible for the collection, investigation and interpretation of data relative to sighting of unidentified flying objects. Attached incident summaries 1 thru 172 from the files of Project "SIGN" are forwarded for study and recommendation as to which of the incidents may be eliminated as balloons released on routine synoptic ascents by the Air Weather Service, the Navy Aerological Service or the United States Weather Bureau. The summaries attached may be retained in your headquarters for working and reference purposes.

2. The Air Weather Service is the only agency of its type that has been asked to assist in the accomplishment of Project "SIGN" except that the United States Weather Bureau has provided information on all lightning. Research projects in which balloons are used and which are conducted by or sponsored by the Army, Navy or the United States Air Forces are checked by the Intelligence Department of this Command. These checks are usually made direct from the Project "SIGN" office, MACLOX-3. These checks are distinct from the checks of synoptic balloon flights made by weather service stations of the Air Force, the Navy and the Department of Commerce. (U. S. Weather Bureau) requested of Air Weather Service.

3. It is the opinion of this office that the below listed incidents are those having the greatest possibility of being balloons. This list does not eliminate the possibility that many of the remaining incidents are balloons.

NOTE

2 September 1948

Wright A. Field

Mr. [Name Redacted] of MPAA, advises the following:

Mr. [Name Redacted] contacted a man in [Location Redacted] on August 1948, who
stated that on that date at 5:30 A.M. he observed a 29" Army silver colored
shape which seemed to rise from behind his woods and continued to fly
across his farm. During flight it seemed to increase, a silvery substance which
floated earthward. While still viewed by this farmer, the sphere disinte-
grated in mid-air. This man's name is [Name Redacted] of [Location Redacted], Ohio,
[Contact Information Redacted]. Information is rather important since the
farmer concerned was a man approximately 50 some odd years of age and appear-
ed to be very conscious and sincere while relating this incident.

The subject seemed to have risen while the two men were talking and
an airplane happened to fly overheard whereas the farmer then related the
foregoing experience. Mr. [Name Redacted] could be contacted in this event that any
assistance is deemed advisible should a meeting with this farmer be advisable.
