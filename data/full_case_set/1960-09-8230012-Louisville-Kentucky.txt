The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book record card, which is a document used to record information about a UFO sighting.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a text document, likely an excerpt from a project Blue Book report.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
TO: Base Operations Officer

1. At approximately 2350 hours 20 Sept 1960 I witnessed what I believe was an unidentified flying object.

2. While cruising in a F-47 aircraft above an overcast at 9,000 ft and about 15 miles southwest of Louisville, Kentucky, my attention was attracted to a bright, orange-red, light source at my 3 o'clock position and slightly below my altitude. The object was traveling at an extremely fast rate of speed, estimated at 800-1000 mph, traveling in a northwest-southeast direction. The object's course appeared to be erratic and high altitude. The object passed in front of the aircraft and was similar to a sphere which I had previously witnessed.

3. The object appeared to be emitting a pulsating glow. These objects were flying parallel to each other but at different altitudes and traveling in opposite directions. After passing my aircraft, the objects seemed to be ascending, disappearing into the overcast. The entire sighting lasted approximately 10 to 15 seconds.

4. Immediately upon exiting the aircraft and more or less discussing the incident, it was found to be in the area of the flight. Their reply was negative--no aircraft in our area. This incident was reported to the command post and in turn reported to Air Defense Command. I have however, personally discussed this incident with Operations Officer and he concurs that this becomes a significant incident to be analyzed and that this warrants further investigation. I believe the speed and altitude of these objects greatly exceed any known aircraft.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a memo routing slip that is filled out with some handwritten text.

The text on the routing slip says:

The handwritten remarks section states:
