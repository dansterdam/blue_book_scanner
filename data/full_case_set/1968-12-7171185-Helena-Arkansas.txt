Details ARE DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS:
I AM NOT REALLY SURE OF THE DATE OF THE SIGHTING, BUT I REPORTED THE SIGHTING SOON AFTER IT WAS OVER, AND THE TERROR I EXPERIENCED WITH THIS QUESTIONING IS STILL VIVID. 
NEIGHBORS AND I TO LOOK AT THIS CRAFT. ONE OF THE NEIGHBOR'S CHILDREN SAID HE HAD SEEN IT BEFORE HIS MOTHER WOULD NOT COME OUTSIDE TO LOOK. APPROXIMATELY 60 SECONDS, I CALLED A FRIEND, WHO WORKS AT THE ARKANSAS POWER AND LIGHT STATION ABOUT 30 MILES BELOW HELENA. THEY HAD SEEN NOTHING. THIS IS WHERE I THOUGHT THE UFO MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN EASILY, AND THEY ARE ALWAYS OUT ON THE STRUCTURE.
SEEING THE AIRPLANE AND BEING A PILOT MYSELF, I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE MEMPHIS FLIGHT SERVICE STATION TO SEE IF THEY COULD BE MADE WITH THE PLANE. IF THEY REFUSED TO HILLBROOK ABOUT HIS STATION, THEY RETURNED ME TO WITTINGTON ABOUT A POSSIBLE ERROR.
I ANSWERED A QUESTIONNAIRE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO THIS EFFECT, I REALIZE THESE STATEMENTS TO BE ALMOST TRUE.

Now, as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract all the text found in the document:

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "*" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE PHENOMENON MOVED.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "*" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON AFTER IT HAS MOVED. MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "*" - THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

The image contains two illustrations. The top illustration is a compass rose with directional labels. The bottom illustration depicts a person standing on a road or path, with mountains or hills in the background. There is also a smaller inset image showing a person standing in a landscape with mountains or hills.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch that appears to depict the path of a UFO sighting. It shows a valley with mountains on either side, and an arrow-like trajectory of the observed phenomenon moving from right to left. There is also some accompanying text that provides instructions for the observer and asks them to estimate the angular size of the observed object.

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

AFR 80-17(C1)

15. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON. INCLUDE ANGULAR SIZE, TRAIL, EXHAUST, AND INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING. 

These were no upper trails or tails. It rose directly up fron valley to south.

16. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR TREE. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH -- NOW IF YOU HAD BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM THIS EXPERIMENT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, ESTIMATE WHAT FRACTION OF THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH.
