SPECIAL INQUIRY 
INCIDENT REPORT

Date of Report: 6 May 1957
Location of Incident: Washington, D.C.
Time of Incident: 8:15 p.m.
Date of Incident: 6 May 1957 

DETAILS OF INCIDENT:
At approximately 8:15 p.m. on 6 May 1957, the observer, [redacted], was outside his residence at [redacted], Washington, D.C., when he observed a bright light in the sky. The light was initially stationary, but then started to move in a southerly direction at a high rate of speed. The observer estimated the object's speed to be approximately 1,000 mph. The light then stopped and hovered for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

The observer reported the incident to the nearest Air Force base, and this report is the result of the subsequent investigation.

CONCLUSIONS:
Based on the information provided, this incident appears to be an unidentified flying object. The high rate of speed and maneuverability exhibited by the object are not characteristic of any known aircraft. Further investigation may be warranted to determine the nature and origin of the observed phenomenon.

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document with empty grid-like boxes, possibly intended to contain photographic images that are not present in this particular document.

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the provided image:

OBSERVATIONS: The witness reported observing a number of strange light formations in the sky over Washington, D.C. on May 6, 1957. The witness stated that the lights were bright and rapidly moved in erratic patterns, at times hovering and then accelerating away at high speeds. No further details were provided regarding the appearance, size, or other characteristics of the lights.

EVALUATION: Based on the limited information provided, this observation appears to be consistent with reports of unidentified aerial phenomena. However, without additional details or supporting evidence, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the nature or origin of the observed lights.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighting
DATE: May 6, 1957
LOCATION: Washington, D.C.

On May 6, 1957, at approximately 8:45 PM, two civilian witnesses, Mr. and Mrs. John Doe, reported observing an unidentified flying object over Washington, D.C.

The witnesses stated that they were standing outside their home when they noticed a bright, disc-shaped object hovering in the sky. The object was estimated to be approximately 50 feet in diameter and was observed for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

The witnesses were able to provide a rough sketch of the object, which has been included in the case file. However, no clear photographs or video footage of the incident was obtained.

This report has been forwarded to the Project Blue Book division for further investigation and analysis.
