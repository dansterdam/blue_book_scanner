The given image does not appear to contain any photographs or visual elements. It is a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official United States Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

SEP 17 1965

TDFN
UFO Sighting, Pike County, Missouri 

Hq USAF SAFOIN (Mrs Hunt)
Wash D C 20330

1. Reference the attached unidentified object report from our area. The sighting of objects on the nights of 26 July and 4 September 1965 were reported and investigated.

2. We had no unusual reports from Pike County, Missouri during this period. The UFO reported could not be shown by air surveillance and/or ground observers. We feel that the normal time lapse and delay of the submission of her report no attempt will be made to identify a specific flight.

FOR THE COMMANDER

ERIC T de JONCKHEERE
Colonel, USAF
Deputy for Technology and Subsystems

ORIGINATOR: TDFN/UFO MAJ B QUINTANNILLA, JR DATED 9-15-65
