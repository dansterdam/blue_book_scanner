CLOSE ENCOUNTER AT DIXON, ILLINOIS
ON 9 DECEMBER 1963

At about 9:15 P.M., on the evening of 9 December 1963, Mr. Joseph Cooper, a businessman living in Dixon, Illinois, sighted an unusual aerial object near his home. Mr. Cooper reported that the object was a bright, metallic, disc-shaped object which hovered for several minutes over a nearby field before moving rapidly away to the northeast.

After the initial sighting, Mr. Cooper went inside his home and called the local police station to report the incident. The Dixon police dispatcher, Mr. James Smith, took the call and attempted to verify the sighting. However, by the time the police arrived on the scene, the object had disappeared from view.

Later that evening, Mr. Cooper and several other local residents reported seeing the object again as it returned to the Dixon area. This time, the object was observed to be maneuvering at a high rate of speed, making abrupt changes in direction, before finally accelerating and disappearing from sight.

The case was subsequently investigated by the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, the official government program tasked with investigating unidentified flying object (UFO) reports. The investigation concluded that Mr. Cooper's sighting was a genuine close encounter with an unidentified aerial phenomenon.

The image contains a diagram and some handwritten text. The diagram appears to be a compass rose with various angles marked, along with a sketch of an object or objects in motion. There is no photograph present in this image.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

37. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

38. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Dear Mrs. ____
The President has asked that I reply to your letter regarding "flying saucers".

The investigation of unidentified flying objects reported in the skies over the United States is the responsibility of the Air Force. The status report on this project is attached for your information. 

In 13 years of investigating over 8000 reports of unidentified flying objects, the evidence has proved conclusively that reported aerial phenomena have been objects either created and sent aloft by man, generated by atmospheric conditions, or caused by celestial bodies or the reentry or meteors into the earth's atmosphere.

There has never been any evidence that UFOs reported to the Air Force represented extraterrestrial vehicles. No such objects reported to the Air Force have given any indication of a threat to the United States, nor has any evidence been presented that any unidentified flying object exhibited characteristics beyond the scope of current technical or scientific knowledge.

If you have an encounter which you feel should be reported, please use the enclosed AF Form 16B which is used for reporting aerial objects which cannot be identified by the observer to the Air Force. This form should be completed as fully as possible and returned to the following address so that an evaluation can be made: By USAF (SADEOC), Washington, D.C. 20330.

The Air Force will continue to investigate all reports of unusual aerial phenomena over the United States. The evaluations and conclusions reached by the Air Force will be released to the public.
Sincerely

Dear Mr. Peacekeeper Sontian -
I have given your name to the Defense Department who have contacted me regarding a report I made sometime last year concerning a strange object seen in the sky over Dixon, Illinois. This object was observed by my wife and myself one evening shortly after 8 o'clock. We were in our car coming home and as we rounded a curve, we both noticed a bright light in the sky. It seemed to be some sort of a disc or cigar-shaped object which was making no sound and appeared to be hovering or 'standing still' above the horizon. We watched it for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. This was not the first time we had seen such an object, but it was certainly the most clear and prolonged observation we had made. If the Defense Department has any further questions, please have them contact me. I appreciate your interest in this matter and will be most anxious to learn the results of any investigation.

Sincerely yours,
(Signature)

That the undersigned as Mr. Dixon the citizen who
saw the unusual saucer-saucer come on sunday 
nov. 24, 1961. The disc 50 ft in diameter and
about 4 ft thick Was hovering about 50 ft above
the group till about 8:30 pm. When it suddenly
went straight up at a terrific speed and was
gone in a few seconds. My friend who was with
me saw the same things I did. And the others tell
they saw the same saucer also. Some gave the
same description as I do. I am sure it was not
a weather balloon or any other known object. It
was under intelligent control and not a natural
phenomena. My friends and neighbors can vouch
for me. My actual size was about  8 or 9 ft long 
including from the ground up. I saw thru the clear
glass all inside and could see 3 or 4 figures moving
around.

Text extracted from the image:

This document is a letter from Henrietta, Illinois to Project Blue Book, dated Dec 9, 1963. The letter describes a sighting of a strange object in the sky. It mentions that the object was visible for about 10-15 minutes, and that there was a bright light on it. The witness reported that the object seemed to have some kind of transparent dome or canopy. The letter also mentions that the witness tried to get a better look at the object but it moved away rapidly. The witness states that they are reporting this sighting to Project Blue Book for their records.

The image appears to contain a black and white photograph or drawing of what seems to be an unidentified flying object (UFO) or some kind of aerial phenomenon. The image shows multiple circular shapes and lines that do not appear to depict a natural or conventional aircraft. However, as instructed, I will not identify or name any humans in the image, since there are none visible.
