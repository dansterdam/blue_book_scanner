Dear Sir:

On the evening of Wednesday, August 14 my granddaughter, and I were driving home in Morton Grove, Illinois. At 7:33 p.m. we sighted a strange looking light in the western sky. It was shaped like a drop of water tilted about 30 degrees below horizontal, changing slightly as it moved. It was about 10 degrees above the horizon, went behind a cumulus cloud, and emerged below it. At this time it appeared about four times as large and was very bright. A slight halo reflection from it, it was not a dazzling light; it was just white and very bright. It seemed to stop below the cloud, hover a moment and begin to move west, against the wind which was from the north. It gained speed and normally grew smaller until it disappeared from view.

The light was in view for eight minutes. At no time while it was in view did we see any dark metallic object or protrusions which might indicate it was an aircraft.

Sincerely,
