AIR FORCE PUBLICATIONS DISTRIBUTION: DIVISION
Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C. 

A little over a month ago I ordered a few publications dealing with the Division of Air Force published material bearing on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects. You know, etc. - that is, the same kind of thing you referred me to your office on back in October of last year.

I am extremely interested in this field and have been for some time. I have a strange object some time ago—the details of which I have written you about—and an airport most of my life(?)

The camera has been scrutinized by experts. The indications are, the objects were taken on 35mm film—and we have positive proof that the negatives were not retouched.

These objects are not meteors—they are "things" that appear to be intelligently operated. 
There is no hoax, and we sincerely wish to know just what is happening along these lines. Is this important enough for the Air Force to look into a little further?

Sincerely,

1. Answers to report have implied that there may be some distortion or warping, and that the quality of the negatives and prints may not be clear enough to determine just what the objects could be. Small spots, apparently flaws in the negatives, could perhaps be nothing more than normal technical faults. The significant question appears to be the nature of the image itself, and whether it could be interpreted as indicating something unusual compared to the normal characteristics of an aerial phenomena caused by known factors. Any opinion or explanation as a view of the image must necessarily be inconclusive without more complete analysis.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads:

"The random traces appearing on all of probably were caused by a small object the upper right corner of the screen, motionless in relation to the lean and in the field of view."

- page 6 -

The document contains a photograph of an unidentified object, which appears to be a 3/4" diameter image that could be taken with a 35mm camera. The text mentions that this image could be of a "daytime object" but does not provide further details about the object itself.

APCH-4E/Maj Friend/r/59215
UFO Photographs

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],
The photographs of an unidentified object which you loaned to us have been processed. The negative films were probably caused by a malfunction showing behind the contacts when the shutter was opened in the field of view.

The 3/4" diameter image which appears on the negatives could be taken with a 35mm camera. This image could be that of a daytime object. This image could be that of a balloon or a reflection. It is possible that the company which processed the film altered the image in some way, or that the object was much closer to the camera than you had assumed.

The prints and negatives which you loaned to the Air Force are returned with this letter. The Air Force thanks you for your interest and cooperation in this case.

Sincerely,

[SIGNATURE]
