CONCLUSION:
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
No sound, no trails, no radical maneuvers. (No case in file).
COMMENTS:
It is believed by the rating officer that the object sighted was probably a balloon. The balloon was most probably reflecting the sun's rays even though the sightings area was in dark. Description was not consistent with meteor sighting. Too brief for confirmed balloon identification. Insufficient data for evaluation.
