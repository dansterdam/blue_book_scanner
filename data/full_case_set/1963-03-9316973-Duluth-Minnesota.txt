The image provided does not contain a photograph. It is a page from a science news letter discussing the planet Mars and its brightness in the sky.

ASTRONOMY  
Mars Still Shines Brightly
Mars is rapidly drawing away from earth but is still easy to identify by its red color and its brightness, greater than any visible star except Sirius, during the present, as the middle of the month.
ALTHOUGH MARS is rapidly moving away from the earth, it is still brighter than it has been at any time since the end of the first week of March; an hour earlier at the mid-month and now half an hour before midnight. This is the time to observe Mars.
Mars Easy to Identify  
First, it is the brightest, greater than any visible star except Sirius, and it can be quickly identified because of its red color. It shines with a steady light, unlike the twinkling stars.
Second, Mars appears to be cheater or farther away from the Earth for this visit; then it is usually brighter. This is actually one of the times it is closest to Earth, but it is rapidly diminishing in size. As the end of this month approaches, Mars will be appreciably smaller, but it will continue to shine brightly, fainter than it will be a few months from now, when it will be too far from the sun and Earth to be easily observed.
The constellations of Cancer and Leo are prominent in the eastern sky, within which - to the right is Castor, and to the left is Pollux, the twin stars of Gemini.
To the south, the brilliant planet Saturn is now rising about an hour and a quarter after sunset, and Jupiter, during March, are steady, brilliant objects, like the sun and shines brightly in the south. Saturn is now a morning star, rising more and more each day before sunrise.
The "Canals" Controversy  
Of all the planets in the sky, the one that has attracted most popular interest is undoubtedly Venus. And this is largely due to the controversy that has arisen regarding the possibility of life on that mysterious planet. Some believe that they have detected there, by telescope, evidence of definite surface markings, which they call "canals." This theory was first propounded in 1877 by an Italian astronomer, Giovanni Schiaparelli, director of the Brera Observatory in Milan. He wrote of observing them, and he called them "canali," which in Italian means "channels," but this word in English was translated as "canals." This suggested that they had an artificial origin, and could represent the work of intelligent beings who might have some means of transporting the necessities of life from one region of Venus to another.
This suggested that they had an artificial origin and could represent the work of intelligent beings who might have some means of transporting the necessities of life from one region to another on Venus. However, more recent telescopic observations that are more reliable have failed to confirm the existence of any such markings, and the "canals" are now believed to have been entirely illusionary.
Minor details can be added, it will appear, but the major facts about Venus, as far as we now understand them, are that Venus is a cloud-covered planet, whose surface we could not see even with the most powerful telescopes. Most astronomers believe that conditions on Venus are so inhospitable that the possibility of life on that planet is extremely doubtful.
Through large telescopes on the surface of the earth and soon from observatories on satellites orbiting Venus, we expect to gain much new information about this mysterious planet. But one thing is certain: we will have to wait a long time before we can say with any assurance that intelligent life exists on Venus.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for February 23, 1963

Any young astronomer considering investigation this method, should first consult with your local museum or through a telescope service, to learn what is actually needed. The optics of a telescope are NOT sufficient protection.

The article discusses the Mariner fly-by of Venus, noting that a Soviet Martian probe is expected to arrive at Mars shortly. It also includes a "Celestial Time Table for March 1963" with information about the positions and visibility of various celestial bodies throughout the month.

The article also discusses a new "platinum electrodes" technology that can help diagnose heart defects, as well as a "New Cancer Treatment Detection Method" involving surgery and radiation therapy.

Yeovil, England
2 March 1963

Match 15 minutes after they
were first sigheed, 3 light-like
objects were seen in the sky
over Yeovil, England. The observer, Mr. K., noticed the objects
while on his way to work, and
watched them for several minutes. He said they appeared
to be circular or spherical in
shape and were brilliant or
glowing white in color. The objects seemed to be at a high
altitude and moved erratically
at one point, seeming to accelerate and then slow down. According to the report, there was
no sound associated with the
sighting. The objects faded
from view after about 15 minutes. No photographs were taken.

CLEVELAND-E 142nd St area-MAR 6, 1963 - 7PM
A piece of her metal visiting about 3 inches long, 1.5 inches wide, 1/4 inch thick was picked up from the ground. The object, made of anti-iron and containing about 7% to 8% nickel was claimed a part of an aircraft's tip "too hot to touch". It is about the size of an attio box and it is believed to be a from an inter-stellar vehicle, as the color, texture and shape were very unusual. It was that is was a part of a inter-stellar vehicle shot down by the Air Force for "intruder".

Source: Flying Saucer Review (XIII Aug 63)

The text in the document is as follows:

"At 6.40 a.m. I saw an object in the sky. It was a fairly bright light, roughly circular in shape and appeared to be revolving slowly on its own axis. It was white in colour, but after about 1 1/2 minutes, it turned a distinct orange-red. It then seemed to fade away and disappear. The whole phenomenon lasted about 4 minutes.

The object appeared to be at a great height, and remained stationary throughout the observation. It could have been as much as 5 miles away. I do not think it could have been a conventional aircraft or any known astronomical object. It is difficult to estimate the size of the object, but I would guess it was about 1/2 mile in diameter.
I am a professional man and normally a quite sceptical observer of unusual phenomena. But I am quite certain that what I saw on this occasion was a genuine unidentified flying object."

Duluth, England

Time: 1.45

Weather: Fair, calm.

Narrative: At approximately 1.45 am on 10 March 1963, a civilian observer sighted an unidentified flying object over Duluth, England. The object was described as circular in shape, of a dull greyish color, and approximately 100 feet in diameter. No details on the object's altitude or flight path were provided. The observer reported the sighting to the local authorities.

Our position in this matter is that there is nothing in the report which indicates any threat to national security or evidence of extraterrestrial activity. We do not believe that further investigation is warranted at this time.

THE ABOVE PHOTO (not related to the Moore story, which begins on Page 10), was taken at about 2:30 P.M. on the afternoon of March 12th, 1963. The witness was a correspondent of SAUCER NEWS, who was sitting on the back porch of his home in Albany, New York, when he noticed a strange object in the sky. The object was hovering for several seconds, then suddenly shot upward at a steep angle and disappeared. The witness claims he had no time to get his camera to photograph the object, but he was able to sketch several pictures of it as it appeared in the sky. No further details are available as yet.

Already, New York, March 12, 1963: A correspondent of SAUCER NEWS who wishes to remain anonymous, photographed a UFO on his back porch. He states at about 2:30 P.M. on this date he observed a peculiar object in the sky for several seconds before it suddenly shot upward and disappeared. The witness claims he had no time to photograph the object, but he made several quick sketches of the UFO. The pictures show a round, disc-like object. No other details are available at this time.

Scout Leader Observes Strange Light
On the afternoon of March 22, 1963, between 3:30 and 4:00 p.m., Mrs. Beseris Watson, an assistant den mother at the Piedmont Council, Boy Scouts of America, witnessed the passage of four UFOs. These UFOs were described as being white in color and flat in shape. The outlines were not sharp and were fuzzy around the edges. They moved at great speed and did not appear to follow a straight course, though it was a sunny day with good seeing conditions.
The first two which traveled toward the west passed one after the other and were not in formation. A few minutes later another one appeared, going west and objects which was going east also. No more were seen.

It was hovering over VSW to a point just east of the bridge area. The craft was 100-200 ft above ground and moving very slowly at about 3-5 mph and slightly to the south. It appeared very solid, yet oddly illuminated. The interior was clearly visible as a bright light was plainly visible in the center which obstructed the observation distinctly for about 30 sec. As it moved away it seemed to become translucent, yet the illumination was still visible. The observer watched it disappear 4 1/2 miles east of Hillsdale. Duration of sighting was from 9:15 to 9:29 PM.

WOOSTER, OHIO-March 31, 1963....8:00 PM
The witness, a husband and wife driving along in the northern suburb of Wooster were about to encounter what they believe may have been a UFO. 
The main light flashed downward from an estimated 1000 angle. This object was seen travelling in the same direction as the car. Suddenly, the object stopped and hovered above the car, then moved off to the side, travelling ahead of the car. At first the car which was traveling about 30 mph kept pace with the object. The object then appeared to accelerate rapidly and within a few seconds had completely pulled away from the car. The total time from the first sighting to the time it pulled away was only 2 or 3 minutes.
The object appeared to be lighted and travelling at a high rate of speed. The light was brighter than the car headlights and gradually picked up speed until it seemed to be moving at an estimated 600-800 mph. The object had no observable wings, tail, or other distinguishing features except the bright light and horizontal V to E line of flight and disappearance after 2 or 3 minutes.

March 9, 1963

Dear Sir:

I am writing to inform you of an incident which occurred at about 5:00 p.m. on March 6, 1963 in the vicinity of Duluth, Minnesota.

At that time, a shiny metallic object, which seemed to be hovering for a few minutes and then moved away at a very high speed, was observed by several persons, including my daughter and myself.

The object was round or oval in shape and appeared to be of a metallic substance. It did not make any sound that we could detect.

When the object first appeared, it seemed to be hovering about 100 feet off the ground, and then it moved away at an extremely high rate of speed. It was visible for only a few minutes.

I thought you might be interested in this sighting, as I believe it may be of significance. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Sincerely,
[Name Redacted]

"Sear sir: -I am writing to you because I have some data. Can you please examine this material and let me know what you think. The witness is a reliable person who has observed these things before. He said the object was hovering over the trees and was a bluish-white color. It was about 30 to 60 feet in diameter. Please let me know if you need any additional information. Thank you for your attention in this matter.
Sincerely,"
