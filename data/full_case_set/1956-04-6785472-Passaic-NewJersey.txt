The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed letter. The letter discusses a request made by the author one year ago to the Office of Public Information, Department of the Air Force, regarding an Unidentified Flying Object sighting. The letter mentions the Air Force's progress in the search for the answer to the "enigma of the U.F.O.", and the author's attempts to find someone who might have been the "Questioner" referenced in the original request.

Dear Sirs;
One year ago I wrote to the Office of Public Information, Department of the Air Force, Washington 25, District of Columbia; requesting an Air Force Questioner on an Unidentified Flying Object sighting. Their reply was a report of the Air Force's PROGRESS in the search for the answer to the enigma of the U.F.O. . For the past year I have been looking for someone who might have the Questioner. Regarding my search, the friend of a friend had the Questioner, but four of the questions were missing, and I was not allowed to write on it. I solved this by writing the answers to the Questioner on a separate piece of paper.
And this, I decided, should be sent to you at the A.T.I.C. in Dayton, Ohio.
Yours very sincerely,
[Signature Redacted]
