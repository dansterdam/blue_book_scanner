May 19, CAPT. R.S.V. Alsworth, COM-4
Weather and a fast African airelne

The incident occurred as the plane was flying across the Sudan on a routine flight. The weather was extremely poor, with heavy rain and thunderstorms. At one point, the pilot reported that the plane was struck by lightning. Shortly after, the co-pilot noticed a very large green fireball in the sky, which was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter. The pilot and co-pilot both observed the object and described it as being luminous and surrounded by a corona of ionized air. The object passed the plane on its left side at an estimated distance of about 1000 feet and at an altitude slightly below the plane. The pilot and co-pilot, as well as the flight engineer and a passenger, all witnessed the object. After the object passed the plane, the pilot noted that his directional gyro had tumbled and was not functioning properly. The report states that the object was under intelligent control and was described as being a very large green fireball.

NO CASE (Information Only)
7 May 1961
Gundagai, Australia 

Astronomers at Mount Stromlo Observatory in Australia were observing the night sky near Gundagai on May 7, 1961. Assistant astronomer Mr. I. B. Colwell noticed an object in the sky near the observatory that was "not an ordinary astronomical object". According to the report, the object was moving rapidly and appeared to change in shape. A photographer was called in to take photographs, but the object disappeared before any photographs could be obtained.

World Chronicle on 18 February concerning this UFO incident in the Republic of Poland (continuation) 1. Flying saucers in the Republic of Poland around Antonin and liions Warszawa (1961) originals text in the Polish.
At the end 1959, a weekly paper "Walka Mlodych" published a series of articles on Mysterious celestial objects, the OVNI in Poland. The director of the meteorological station of Piotrków Trybunalski (near Lodz) and inhabitants of the village of Helcza (near Piotrków) had observed four flying objects over the village. They were described as being in the shape of umbrellas, and some believed them to be spaceships. Others were against the idea.
A number of stories by eye witnesses were published. We will sight 2 of them. 
1. the Testimony of Mr. R. G.:
in the afternoon of January 1957, Mr. R.G. and his near i garden, afternoon of January 1957, Mr. R. G. near the garden. They were three closer balls. They were of the same size and symmetrically arranged. The three nearest balls, however, seemed to him to shift and alter in luminosity according to balance of seconds of their movement. It was very difficult to determine which of the two balls was passing behind the other. 
2. the testimony of Mrs. K:
All a sudden K. perceived a flying object, round and clear. It was flying towards the village in an oscillating motion and the silhouette appeared to the small but more distinct than at the beginning. She observed that it could be at an altititude of 500 metres, and have a diameter of about 2.5-3 metres. The object disappeared between two mountains and Mrs. K. watched out very carefully but it did not reappear.
2nd Modeling: Observation of Poland, called to the Attention of the Investigation of Unidentified Flying Object of January 7, 1961.
The witness had as a surprise of unidentified flying object January 7, 1961 at about 8 morning.

6:00 in the evening.
1. It was a case of an object of cylindrical form like a cigar which remained suspended, without landing over the village of South Hadley Falls (Mass.). according to the information contained in the report.
It began to move slowly, It changed its position to horizontal (by) and shifted towards the west. The observation lasted about a half an hour and it took place over the center of the railroad station the building owned. This object was citied by one or two acquaintances, along with a number of other persons.
As far as I know the Astronomical Observatory of Warsaw has some details concerning this object, but I do not know what the details of this supposition.
