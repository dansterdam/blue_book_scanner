The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document titled "STATEMENT OF FACT" describing the sighting of a round-shaped object by the witness, Dolan B. Lemarie, on August 12, 1952. The document provides details about the object's appearance, size, and movement, as well as the weather conditions at the time of the sighting. The document is signed by Dolan B. Lemarie and witnessed by Newton H. Comly, an Intelligence Officer.

STATEMENT OF FACT

About 2950 hours, 12 August 1952, I returned home from town with my wife. As I approached the house, I spotted a round shaped object from the front seat of my convertible with the town behind it. It was traveling from north to south at a speed twice as fast as any observable jet at about 8,000 feet. It was about 45 seconds. 15 minutes later I saw white in color, with a small cone shape behind it. The weather was very clear and the object disappeared due to the distance in the eastern maneuver, traveling straight horizontal motion.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
AREA REPORTED ON: LAKE CHARLES, LA.  
DATE OF REPORT: 10 AUG 52  
DATE OF INFORMATION: 8 AUG 52  
EVALUATION: 7  
SOURCE: I. D. BARKSDALE, INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 8THAFDM, BARKSDALE AF BASE, LA.
SUMMARY: It appears to be the belief of the intelligence officer that the aircraft observed was a satellite or artificial satellite, as it was reported that the object moved at a high rate of velocity across the sky. The observer stated that there were no sound and no aircraft in the area when the object was seen trailing a blue-green exhaust or light in the runway.
COMMENTS: The observation was made with several other persons and the object was observed for some time crossing the sky. No other aircraft were seen in the area at the time.
(Signed) D. D. DRAPER, Intelligence Officer

The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document contains a handwritten "Statement of Fact" describing an incident that occurred around 12:30 AM on August 12, 1952. The text describes the witness's observation of a "round shaped object" from the front seat of their car, which appeared to be traveling from north to south at a high speed. The object was observed for about 2-3 seconds and then disappeared. There is no photograph included in this particular document.

Text from the document:

About 2:00 O hours, 12 august 1952, I returned home from town with my wife. About 1/2 mile to drive next to home I spotted a round shaped object from the front seat of my convertible with the top down. It was traveling from north to south at a high speed. I observed it about 2-3 seconds. I estimated its size to be about 20-30 feet. I observed no sound, no means of propulsion, no exhaust, no trail. After about 15 seconds the object disappeared due to distance. There was no sound, no observation of landing, take-off or maneuvering.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be an old document containing text related to a Project Blue Book UFO report.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying object (UFO) reports between 1952 and 1969.

The text in the document appears to be a detailed account or report of a UFO sighting, including information about the date, location, witness, and physical characteristics of the observed object. The report discusses the reliability of the witness and the lack of any physical evidence or fragments related to the sighting.
