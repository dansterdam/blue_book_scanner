The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document with illustrations and instructions related to reporting sightings of unidentified flying objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass rose (circle) to show which direction the object first came from. Place a "B" on the compass rose (circle) to show the direction the object went.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course. 
The object moved in a very slow erratic manner, no definite course or direction could be determined. It just hovered then took on a rather zig-zag motion until out of sight.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:
___ Day ___ Month ___ Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Everything at research war was very quiet. There was a small group of people there and a table of refreshments (coffee and doughnuts). The officers were courteous and helpful but did not seem very interested in what I had to say. They asked many questions but did not seem to believe my story. I tried to explain about the strange lights in the sky but they seemed more interested in the details of my observations rather than the significance of what I had seen. I do not feel that my report was adequately recorded or that the investigation was thorough enough.
