ATTN: ECTS
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

1. In accordance with AF Ltr. AFOTC-CC-1, dated 8 September 1950, the following report of Sightings of Unconventional Aircraft is submitted:

a. Description: A brilliant white light, three times as intense as sunlight, steady in brightness center, diminishing toward edges, with no halo or radiation; circular in shape, and comparative size approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter. No discernible aerodynamic features, trail or exhaust, propulsion system or sound. Sped under tremendous speed, but considered to be silent, impossible maneuvers performed, following maneuvers: Horizontal flight, vertical flight, still flight, sudden turn, extreme speed without approaching aircraft, lost contact with object.

b. Object was sighted at 1537 hours, Eastern Standard time, 1 October 1952, and remained in visual contact until approximately 1920 hours.

c. Object was observed from one RB-29 aircraft traveling at 270 MPH indicated at 22,000 feet. Last visual contact was at approximately 1920 hours, as object faded from view.

d. Location of sighting aircraft: 34° 06'N - 80° 34'W on a heading of 045° true, for approximately 10 minutes. Object appeared to left of aircraft's nose. An unknown distance, passed in front of aircraft's nose from right to left, to a position, came to what appeared to be a complete stop, resumed flight, going to a stop at 10 o'clock to the sighting aircraft. Object remained slightly below altitude of sighting aircraft.

The text in the document is as follows:

ROGIF 360
SUBJECT: Report of Sighting of Unconventional Aircraft

a. There were no known witnesses or other observers. Object sighted by pilot of fighter, Capt. Billet. Age 47, 1700 flying hours, is a veteran of combat operations in the Korean War. Is assigned the additional duty of Assistant Squadron Intelligence Officer, 135th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron.

This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during the mid-20th century.

The text on the page appears to be a standardized form used to document UFO sightings and gather information about them. The form includes various fields for recording details such as the location, time, and characteristics of the observed object, as well as any actions taken by the observers or aircraft in response to the sighting.
