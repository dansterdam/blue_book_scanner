Transcript of the text in the image:

Dear Sirs;
I came very interested in flying saucers. last evening I have witnessed a few of them. at about 8:00 PM I have sighted a few objects in the sky over Pottstown, Pa. which were of an unusual nature. They were reddish in color and moved at a very rapid rate in a NW direction. I watched them for about 15-20 minutes and there were at least 3 or 4 of them. They seemed to be under intelligent control and navigation. I was quite amazed at the display. They seemed to move faster than any jet plane I have ever witnessed. My wife and I both saw them and we were quite excited about the whole thing. This is the first time I have seen anything like this and would like very much to hear from you on the matter. Any information you can give me would be greatly appreciated.
Sincerely yours,
[REDACTED]
