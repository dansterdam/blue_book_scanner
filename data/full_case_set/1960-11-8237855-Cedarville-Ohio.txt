The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, potentially from Project Blue Book, with a series of questions for the observer to answer.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
