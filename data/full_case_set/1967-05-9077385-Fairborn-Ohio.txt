The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a T-LOG P DIAGRAM (MILLIBARS) which is a meteorological graph showing atmospheric pressure and temperature data. The graph is accompanied by an explanation of the various symbols and measurements used in the diagram.

T. LOG P DIAGRAM (MILLIBARS)

EXPLANATION
ISOBARS are straight, horizontal brown lines. The height is in feet of the pressure surface as is the ICAO Standard Atmosphere as on the left.
ISOTHERMS ("C°) are the slightly curved brown lines that intersect the 1000 mb, solar at intervals of 2°C, and run diagonally upward from right to left.
SATURATED ADIABATS are the curved green lines that intersect the 1000 mb, solar at intervals of 2°C, showing upward and toward the dry adiabats. Values appear in the upper part of the diagram.
SATURATION MIXING RATIO (g per kg) is represented by dashed green lines. The values appear at the bottom and middle of the diagram.
ICAO STANDARD ATMOSPHERE SOUNDINGS is indicated by a thick brown line.
The saturated adiabats and isotherms of saturation mixing ratio are computed by use of vapor pressure over a plane water surface at 20°C.
APPROXIMATE VIRTUAL TEMPERATURE may be obtained from the formula t = t + 0.4(r - 10) where t is virtual temperature in °C, t is free air temperature in °C, and r is mixing ratio in g/kg. For purposes of this diagram the mean mixing ratio of the layer for which data are reported and plotted. The open circles indicate the mandatory pressure levels at which wind data are also entered.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document that provides instructions and diagrams related to a UFO report or sighting. The document includes a sketch that shows the position and orientation of an unidentified object in relation to the horizon, as well as a compass rose. There are also instructions for the observer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object or objects.

Text extracted from the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you first saw it.

90°  75°
60°
45°
30°
15°
0°

Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

PRESS FOR THE RECORD

On 7 Jan 1968
Called Mrs. regarding her 11 May 1967 sighting. 
Mrs. called the duty officer and stated that she had seen a craft hovering a red light near the horizon for about 15 min. I asked Mrs. if she had continued to observe the object after having reported it, and if so how long had she observed it. Mrs. stated that she has seen numerous UFO's and that she didn't recall this sighting at all. I then read the contents of the report to her to refresh her memory but after I had finished she reported that she had seen so many that she still couldn't remember the sighting.
