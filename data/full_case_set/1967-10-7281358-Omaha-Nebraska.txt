The object was not sighted for a long period of time since it was several miles away. It appeared to be about the size of a small airplane, very bright(which worried some deer hunters in the area) and It gave the appearance of rotating as it moved along at a steady rate of speed and at a fairly good altitude, say 2-3000 feet. It changed course several times, once making a sharp right turn. It gradually slowed down and disappeared from view.

UFO REPORT - MR. R.P. CAMBRI DGS, MESA, ARIZONA
DATE OF OBSERVATION: OCTOBER 19, 1957
FROM: NICAP CASE SECTION
TO: NICAP, WASHINGTON, D.C.

The attached report of a UFO sighting near Beach Island, Georgia, was sent to us from an anonymous source at Virginia. The sighting occurred on October 19, 1957. The report states that the sighting was made at Wallops Island, Virginia. During the cloud movements, a cylindrical object was observed to emerge from the cloud formation and to ascend vertically at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 7-8 minutes.

The sender of the report checked with the "sky-lite" advertising plane company and revealed that his aircraft was not in the area. Under certain conditions, the report indicates that erroneous conclusions regarding the nature of UFOs are sometimes reached, although conventional explanations may not always be satisfactory. The witnesses are well-known by Mr. Gold.

Respectfully,
NICAP CASE SECTION

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or report about a sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on Wallops Island.

Text from the document:

Mrs. Annalan also saw the Wallops Island rocket display and said that it didn't look anything like this. The time is pretty accurate as she was hurrying to get to something like Desmond. After she discarded the object it showed her pictures of the Irinidad Island UFO. She immediately identified it as the same thing she saw.

I checked the area during the daytime to see if there were any signs on high poles or other things that may have given the appearance described when illuminated at night. There was nothing that even remotely fitted the description of the object seen.

I have known Mrs. Annalan for almost three years (she's my mother in law). She is not an excitable person, and I can vouch for her reliability in general.

Dear Major Burner
First, I would like to apologize for the delay in getting this report to you. I have been ill for the last two weeks and just got back to work today.

As I explained to you on the phone, this is an unusual sighting that I am not quite sure how to interpret. I have never seen anything like it before.

At approximately 2:30 am on July 10th, I was called by the Omaha Police Department to investigate a report of a strange object in the sky. When I arrived at the location, I observed a large, brightly lit object hovering silently approximately 500 feet above the ground. It appeared to be circular in shape and was emitting a pulsing, multicolored light. 

The object remained stationary for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight at an incredible speed. I have no explanation for what I witnessed. I can only describe it as unlike any conventional aircraft I have ever seen.

I hope this report is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

I started to see gating gladdys. I ran to the field glass. I tried to see them move but they seemed to move fast than the eye could see. I could see no lights and would say they moved about 10 degree from staring point in 5 to 8 seconds. They seemed to blend in with the stars and would not maintain contact with them very long. I would lose them and then relocate. They seemed to move at a high speed and would dart off in a straight line. I watched them from 6:35 to 7:20 P.M. I believe what I saw was some type of unexplained phenomena. I have a good knowledge of astronomy, but cannot explain what I saw. I watch the stars night after night and have never seen anything like this before. I hope this helps explain what I saw. Please advise if you need any additional information.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is as a narrative explanation of your sighting.

On the night of Oct. 13, 1967 at about 9:30 PM CDT I was sitting outside my house when I noticed a bright light in the northern sky. It was a clear night with a few scattered clouds. At first I thought it was a star or planet but as I watched it the light began to move back and forth and up and down. It was much brighter and larger than any star or planet I have ever seen. It seemed to be silvery in color and was about the apparent size of a quarter. I called my wife out to see it and she also witnessed the object for several minutes before it suddenly disappeared behind some clouds. It was not making any sound that I could hear.
I have never seen anything like this before and was quite puzzled by what it could be. I am an amateur astronomer and have seen many of the planets, stars and other celestial objects and this was definitely not any of those. It seemed to be some type of aircraft but was unlike any conventional aircraft I have ever seen before. I would be very interested to know if anyone else in the area reported seeing the same object that night."

WORLD REPORT
UFO ... With Project Blue Book
Theodore O. Elsner of Addison said today he got "pretty scared" last July when a sonic boom cracked over Addison just before his mother's car arrived.
Elsner's story was picked up from national newspaper stories that all claim to be from some form of first-hand contact with the mysterious Unidentified Flying Objects, according to Col. John W. Boiler of the Office of Information Services at Chanute Air Force Base at Rantoul, Ill.
Officials at Chanute simply sent Elsner routing forms to fill out for project Blue Book, according to Col. John W. Miller of the Office of Information at the base.
Elsner said the Air Force sent him 5 forms, each of which had to be filled in, along with a letter of instruction on how to fill out the forms.
IN THE official letter, the Air Force said it would define Elsner for the case 5394 and if it found a sonic boom it would classify his report.
Elsner refused to fill out the forms. "The thought of filling out 18 forms, ridiculous," his mother said. "And Elsner said that and wrote that on the forms."

Sees UFO ... With Proof
The sighting of an unidentified flying object has been reported by a Rolling Meadows youth.
Fred Thoma, 17, of 2315 Newman in Rolling Meadows, told police officers William J. Gross and Daniel L. McKenna that he saw a strange craft hovering over a field late Saturday night.
Thoma said that as he was driving west on Central Rd., he observed a bright light ahead in the sky. He stopped his car and watched for several minutes as the light moved slowly ascending.
Thoma told the scene and took several photographs of the object with his camera. The object, he said, was a dome-shaped craft with a "large propeller." He said that there was a white light on the bottom and that it made no sound as it moved.
THOMAS SAID he took his camera home, had the film developed, and brought the pictures to the Rolling Meadows Police Station. The pictures, police said, show an object in the sky, but they could not determine what it was.
Thoma said he drove to the field Sunday morning and found no ground markings or other evidence of the craft's landing.

The report provides details about the sighting, including the time, location, description of the object, path of flight, altitude, speed, and duration. The report concludes by stating that the information and sketch provided are accurate and correct to the best of the observer's ability.

U. F. O. Sighting
Date: October 7, 1967
Time: 7:30 P. M.  
Location: Inlet Creek (White Swan Lake area, East of Casper), Wyoming
Description: Brilliant bright white light similar to a star. Domes pulsated with a bright blue light. 
Path of Flight: West to East on direct course.
Altitude: Impossible to estimate except high above mountains.
Speed: From skyline to skyline in approximately 1 minute.
Flight Description: U. F. O. appeared on the skyline above the mountains on the West moving rapidly East on a straight course across the valley. About 10 seconds after sighting, the object fire ball which appeared to be the same size as the object fire ball hovered in mid air and two separate small parts seem to blow away and then burn out. Directly over the center of the valley, the blue pulsating dome became visible and remained until the object disappeared on the skyline to the East.

Miss Turnurs/SAF-OIC/75525/Oct 13, 1967

Dear [redacted],

This will reply to your letter of October 8, regarding your two sightings of UFOs.

The first happened so long ago, and so many details need to be verified, that positive identification is not possible at this point. Identification would be virtually impossible.

The second sighting was more recent; however, necessary details are missing. Description of the object, if you would care to determine this, would be helpful. In the envelope we are enclosing, to the address given on the envelope, we shall try to determine what you observed.

In the future, should you sight another UFO, please contact the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately. By so doing, you will have a much greater chance of having a detailed lighting identification.

Sincerely,

DAVID L. STUBBSS

The object was observed as a bright light from the west. It appeared to be flying, and as it approached the witness, it had a definite outline and was traveling at a high rate of speed. The light was quite bright, and was the size of a movie screen when it was closest. The light was observed for about 5 minutes and then disappeared over the horizon. 

The witness was driving a car at the time and was approximately 30 miles west of Omaha, Nebraska. The time of the observation was 7:10 p.m. on October 7, 1967.

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
REPLY TO
ATTN OF: BCXI(Capt. Cunningham/402-294-4050)  1 November 1967
SUBJECT: UFO Observation of 8 Oct 67

TO: DET/UF0

Hq Foreign Technology Div (AFSC)
1. Reference to your letter of 17 October 1967 in regard to your
report, I am enclosing the photos of the UFO so that photo analysis
can be performed.

2. I stated in the initial message that a T-29 landed at 0445 hrs,
while the UFO appeared at 0410 hrs. It was impossible for the T-29 to
have been hovering near the landing area at the time of the incident.
The aircraft passed over Omaha at 0330 and an instrument pass would
place the aircraft in the landing pattern. I have no details on the
T-29 as you since it was not an Air Force aircraft. The aircrew of
the T-29 did not see any UFO's and the report was piloted by Captain
Donald D. Emond. The sighting was Captain D.J. Marksberry, Aircraft
Commander, and the co-pilot was Captain James A. Karker.

3. Mr. Griffin of the FAA reports that only three aircraft were in the
area at the time of the sighting. One was the T-29 landing, one was a
Cessna at 10,000 feet arriving at Eppley Airfield, Omaha, and the third
was a DC-3 at 8,000 feet just south of Offutt AFB. This would pin down
the area of the sighting time also. 

4. There were two other sightings near that area. DC-6 passing
Omaha at 0930/31 at 10,000 feet descending to 8,000 feet over Lincoln
on a flight path approximately 3 miles north of the T-29 flight, and
a United Airlines Convair 580 from Denver, Colorado, passed over Omaha
at 0330/27 on a path approximately 10 miles south of the sighting area.

5. The DC-6 and the Convair 580 appear to both have passed the
area too early and at too high an altitude to be a factor, but
mention them in case they are of any importance to you. I have
enclosed a map showing the flight paths.

6. If I can be of any other assistance please let me know.

UFO Observation, 7 October 1967
1. This replies to your request for information on your unidentified flying object (UFO) observation and photograph. Your photograph is presently being forwarded to photo experts at Wright-Patterson AFB for analysis. It is quite likely that the analysis will take several months, since our photo section experts must take time to carefully examine every detail of the photograph. We are therefore forwarding you a copy of your photograph, however, in the meantime are forwarding you a copy of your photograph.

My friend and I were sitting in a car on the highway a little over 10 miles north of Omaha, Nebraska, around midnight when we noticed a light in the sky. At first it appeared to be a star, but it soon became obvious that it was much closer and moving quite rapidly from west to east. It appeared oblong in shape, not round, and had a glowing halo or ring around it. After watching it for a few minutes, it suddenly disappeared. This is only one handwritten piece on the card.

The light was about 3 stories tall with self luminous objects charged from around the outside of its shape. The objects appeared to be different in size but all appeared round in shape. The light observed was very bright in nature and different in appearance from anything I had seen before. It was unlike the glow of a light or the illumination from any type of aircraft that I am familiar with. It appeared to be solid in nature and not transparent. The edges of the objects were sharp and not fuzzy.

NICAP MASSACHUSETTS INVESTIGATING SUBCOMMITTEE
Weston, Massachusetts

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting - Ipswich, Mass. - 10/02/67 - 8:30 PM  
DATE: 10 October 1967
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler, Chairman, NICAP MASS. SUBCOM.
TO: NICAP, Washington, D.C.

SIGHTING BACKGROUND: 
On 10 October 1967 I returned home from work at 6:15 PM. As I sat watching TV, at 8:30 PM my wife called to me that a Mr. William Castle of the Ipswich, Mass. Police Department had just called to report a UFO sighting which had taken place that evening at about 8:15 PM. I immediately called Mr. Castle who related the details of the sighting. He stated that two local police officers had observed the object for about 20 minutes. The object was described as extremely bright, white in color, and changing shape from round to oblong. The object was observed to be hovering and then to suddenly dart off at a high rate of speed. The witnesses, who are described as reliable, were quite concerned about the incident and desired to know if any other reports had been received. I assured him that I would look into the matter and would report back to him.

DRAWING ACCOUNT: (Typed from Investigator Jackson's Report)
GROUP #1 
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Dineen, 4 Endicott Road
Robert Collera, 6 Middle Street  
Miss Marlene Norwood, 88 Leslie Road,  
Mrs. Loretta Rodman, 62 Leslie Road
  
At 8:30 PM, Mr. Frank Dineen left his house to go to his garage which is located in the back of his house. As he was walking, he observed in the eastern sky a very bright, white light which appeared to be hovering. He called his wife and the other members of the group to come outside and observe the object. They all watched it for about 20 minutes, during which time it appeared to change shape from round to elongated. The object remained stationary during the entire observation period and then suddenly darted off at a high rate of speed, disappearing from sight. The witnesses were quite concerned about the incident and felt that something out of the ordinary had been observed. No sound was heard and no colored lights were seen. The object appeared to be self-luminous.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a report related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reported UFO sightings.

ALSO RPT - IPAWLCH, MASS. - LQ/02/27 Page Two

The text on the page describes several reported UFO sightings, including one by Mr. Hiram Mercross in Rowley, Massachusetts on October 3rd, 1967. The report provides details about the sightings, such as the objects' appearance, movement, and the witnesses' reactions. It also mentions a Mr. Parrella E. Lombardo's reported sighting in Ipswich, Massachusetts.

GROUP # 2
Mr. Hiram Mercross
Rowley, Mass. 337-2305

On October 3rd I interviewed Mr. Hiram Mercross at his home in Rowley, Mass. Mr. Mercross observed an unidentified object on the evening of Oct. 2, 1967 at approximately 8:40 PM. He was standing outside his home when he observed a bright object moving toward him rapidly from the south and then suddenly stopped approximately 150-200 yards away and remained hovering about 50-75 feet off the ground. The object appeared to be oval-shaped and was giving off a brilliant white glow. It hovered there for approximately 30 seconds and then raced away to the north at a terrific speed, disappearing from sight in about 3-4 seconds. Mr. Mercross was quite upset by the incident and stated that he could see no windows, lights, or any other identifying features on the object. It just appeared as a glowing oval-shaped craft. The distance was such that he could clearly make out the details of the object.

GROUP # 3 
Parrella E. Lombardo
Ipswich, Mass. 356-3323

By the time I had interviewed Mr. Lombardo, he said that he had read accounts of the incident involving Mr. Mercross and that he had experienced a similar sighting on the same evening at approximately 8:40 PM. He said that the object appeared to be oval-shaped, giving off a brilliant white glow, and that it hovered for about 30 seconds before speeding off to the north.

L 00 RB - Iverlodt, Mass. - 6/02/67

INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS:

Mrs. Pierson's sketch illustrates a "domed" object as
seen by her at  128 in Woburn in the fall of 1966. The
object was described as aluminum-colored, 30-40 feet in
diameter and 15-20 feet high. It hovered over the
witnesses at what was estimated to be about 150 feet
altitude. The object then shot straight up and was lost
to sight in a matter of 5-10 seconds. No sound was
reported to be associated with the object.

However, from the other data present, the witness
statements indicate that the object did not appear to be
solid but was somewhat transparent, permitting the
observer to see hazy outlines of the object (see witness
statement 5) "no sound" 6) "was GLASSY" (see reporting
forms).

All witnesses involved are of average intelligence. No
evidence of hoax or hallucination is evident. The
witness appears to be sincere in her report and there is
no reason to believe she has fabricated the story. By
her description, the object would have had to be
approximately 200 feet in diameter. The witnesses
observed the object for 2-3 minutes prior to its
disappearance. During this time it moved an estimated
distance of 1/2 mile. The object's path to its ascent
was described as in a straight line.

On October 28th I returned to the Pierson's home to obtain
additional information. I gained permission from the
family to interview their 16-year-old son and 12-year-old
daughter. They essentially corroborated the details as
described by Mrs. Pierson. Their descriptions of the
object were identical and they indicated that the object
seemed to be solid, reflecting the sunlight, and giving
the impression of being metallic in appearance. The
children also stated that, instead of yelling, they
remained silent and stared at the object. Mrs. Pierson
had admonished them to remain quiet lest they frighten
the object away.

ANIMAL REACTION:

Everyone remembered distinctly that their dog became
agitated during the sighting and barked continuously,
even after the object departed the area. The dog was
described as being very restless and disturbed.

INVESTIGATOR'S EVALUATION: It is felt that this case
represents a genuine UFO sighting.

UFO RPT - Ipswich, Mass. - 16/02/57

SIGHTINGS: The sightings are summarized below:

1) A family named Fowler (an ostimation to say) on Lowell Street, Ipswich, Mass., saw a white object hovering over a tree. As they watched, it shot upward at great speed.

2) Mrs. Quindillani thought her dog may have caused a fright as he was grunting.

3) A police officer said he had watched "a bright light" both of her dogs were barking at the sight of this. The officer said the light would not come near when called for a near 15-minute period.

ADDITIONAL DATA: The area which the UFO moved behind were about 150 feet high. ADVERTISING PLANE: Not sighted on this date. 
WEATHER: (U.S. Weather, Logan Airport, Boston, Mass.)
TIME: 8:30 PM   TEMP: 55°   VISIBILITY: Clear CEILING
WIND DIRECTION: South  WIND SPEED: 9 mph
ASTRONOMICAL: Both sightings occurred during night. Full moon out, astronomical phenomena.

SATELLITE DATA: Satellite information not applicable.
CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT: Configuration and noise/lights factors seem to rule out all observers were easily star-gazing. Some dissimulation but not distinctly.

EVALUATION: As the sightings are complete reports, they do not appear to be significant UFO evidence and falls into the classification of an Identifiable Incident. The identity of the sightings is unknown.

NOTE: Photograph and drawing references are not applicable. Report date 10/2/57 YYMM/DD.

UFO SIGHTING REPORT

1. PERSONAL ACCOUNT

In your own words, please describe the incident as it happened. (If additional pages are used, they are numbered.)

The sky was hazy and a yellowish color. I saw what appeared to be a u.f.o. rise up from the horizon and move up and take an arc. It seemed to be two yellowish-white lights and two years ago I saw something similar in same general area. The object was flat across the top was circular and was extremely fast. I watched it with the red green while (prominent)
it seemed to lose altitude and went out of sight northwest. This lasted for quite a few minutes observation and there were no other like it in the sky at that time.

October 17, 1957

Dear Mr. Sheerc,

I was most gratifying to get your letter yesterday, and to know that you had found out what you had really seen.

Now that you have identified your UFO, and are sending the questionnaire to Wright-Patterson AFB, we will let them know you are not going to send it.

And incidentally, we do not think you are a silly idiot; just the only people who do not make mistakes are those who lack intelligence and the ability to observe the world around them. It takes a really big person to admit that he has made a mistake.

Thank you for letting us know what you saw.

Sincerely,

Civil Branch
Community Relations Div.

Day Sheerc, New York 11706

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an old document, likely a report or letter related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Dear, ____, 

I fell like a dummy after writing to you saying that I saw three U.F.O.'s in the sky on October 3,but usually when I write a letter or something to be mailed it has the tendency to hang around my desk for about 12 years(I'm 17).Well with your letter I mailed it that night.I went to bed that night at about 11:30,and while listening to the radio,it's a portable and under my pillow N.A.S.A.was making the sky turn weird colors.What was happening was that N.A.S.A. was experimenting with the atmosphere. (If you remember,you probably don't.I said I saw the same things about two years before.) The next day guess what was on the front page of the two most popular newspapers. "SPACESHIPS LAND AND RED AND GREEN STRIPED CREATURE'S APPEAR". No it didn't say that,but it did say,and explain.

- page 166 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a scanned document containing handwritten text.

that N.A.S.A. was experimenting with the ac-celosphere and that at the same time the fol-lowing night the same thing would happen. Sure enough it did and I felt like an idiot,and a big one at that (I'm 6 foot 3 inches).

Well now that you have read the introduction 
to my question here it is: Should I fill out
the questionaire on the u-f-o's (U.F.O.'s)

It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The text on the page is a letter addressed to "SAPOI, Washington D.C." and describes the author's experience of observing three white objects on the horizon of the north star. The author mentions using an astrolabe to observe the objects and provides details about their size and movement.

If she stands in your hands and wastenaper basket,I'll tell you the reason why I write you.Tonight,at about 7:25,I went to look out of my window and saw three white objects that were about on the horizon of the north star.They were drawn to my attention by one of my brothers and my mother.( I just reseach)
I wrote and I want to clarify something."the objects were like masses and they were not moving,but eventually did disappear,as I will explain later."the same happened again,and the north stars seemed to be growing in the night sky.This is because in the I am in it now.I used an astrolabe to show the easterly
These masses that I mentioned were about 3from where I was,in diameter,and as they faded away,got larger and larger.They grew to about 5 or 6 inches while I was observing this phenomena I was missing phenomena (I Dresp or Sannie).

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

I fell like a dummy after writing you saying that I saw three U.F.O.'s in the sky on October 3,but usually when I write a letter or something to be mailed it's the tendency to hang around my desk about 12 years (I'm 17).Well with you I mailed it that night.I went to bed and I think about 11:30 and while listening to the radio,its a portable and under my pillow,I heard that N.A.S.A. was saying the sky turn weird color's. What was penning was that N.A.S.A. was experimenting with the atmosphere.(If you remember I said I saw the same about two years before.)The next day what was on the front page of the two popular newspapers, "SPACESHIPS LAND AND GREEN STRIPPED CREATURE'S APPEAR" ,it didn't say that,but it did say,and...

that N.A.S.A. was experimenting with the
masphere and that at the same time the
lowing night the same thing would happen.
enough it did and I felt like an idiot,
big one at that(I'm 6 foot 3 inches).
Well now that you have read the intro-
to my question there it is.should I fill out
the questionairre on the yourself-owns (UFO)
because I NOW, know what I saw and cert
you know what it was.My address is on th
tem,and thanks again for listening to my
plaints.

Dear [redacted],

It was most gratifying to get your letter yesterday and to know that you had found out what you had really seen.

No, now that you have identified your UFO, you will not need to send the questionnaire to Wright-Patterson AFB; we will let them know you are not going to.

And incidentally, we do not think you are a great big idiot just remember that the only people who do not make mistakes are those who lack intelligence and the ability to observe the world around them. It takes a really big person to admit that he has made a mistake.

Thank you for letting us know what you saw.

Sincerely,

Civil Branch

Dear Bill,

I've read your March 1957 edition about U.F.O.'s and found it very interesting. All though I may not be an intellectual genius, I'm no dummy.

If the letter is still in your hands, and no wastepapar basket, I'll tell you the reason why I wrote you. Tonight, at about 7:25, I went to look out of my window and saw three white objects that were about on the horizon or the north star. They were drawn to my attention by one and I want to clearly something, "the objects looked like masses and they were not moving, but eventually did disappear, as I will explain later." the same happened with the north star, I determined this because in the 12" now, I used an astrolabe to show the earth. 

These masses that I mentioned were about 3 deg. wide, and as they faded away, got larger and larger. They grew to about 5 or 6 inches while I was observing this phenomena. I was missing this phenomenon (I detected them at the last) . The first mass to go smallest, and the large one lasted 7:40. The two other's, within the period of twenty minutes to disappear.
