A Mr. *********** Frenchman's Bayou, Arkansas, claims joining, Ark
RS 4610 Mrs. 75 miles from Memphis, Tenn and reported to Col. Newman
Ragans, Denver, Colorado on Dec 54. They were joining in the 32 flares,
entered the ground and was still moving.
Col. Newman called Col. O'hara via turn call and me.
I placed a call to Hq 4602 to have the request unit investigate.
Also requested they let me have a short preliminary report as soon as
possible pending however that if it could be identified in some reasonable
way they do not send it in with other reports we could not identify.
Inform Col. O'Hara when you get me anything definite. Martin

1030 hrs, 20 Dec 54
A telephone call received from Capt. Ballowrant, Flt Commander, 4602B Bat at Grandview AAF, Missouri. Capt. Ballowrant reported that he and members of his detachment flew down to Mr. ********** farm on Friday night, 17 Dec 54.
They found a 1600 acre farm on which he grows rice and cotton. The rice field is separated from the cotton field by a man made ditch approximately 15 feet wide. From close inspection of the area, it was evident that spontaneous combustion had taken place and some of the logs and weeds near the ditch line were burned as if by a fire. From the appearance of the burned area, it looked like a burnt path of some object.
A teletype report will be forwarded to ATIC by Capt. Ballowrant which will contain complete details.
