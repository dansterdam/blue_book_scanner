The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. I will proceed to extract the text from the document:

What is now a small cloud that could remain completely motionless in the air, the feeling able to remain still is made pictures, w[h]ich is shaped like a childs' top or gee or a rather greater speed than any high complex silently. Can come straight down or go straight up. Non talking type like an airplane out built in holes in some instances hovering, not unable a cloud.
