SUMMARY (Enter seven names / degrees of report. Give significance in final one-sentence paragraphs. List inclusors at lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112a.)

On 13 February 1956, the Aircraft Dispatcher on duty in Base Operations, Grandview AFB, Mo., received the following information by telephone:

"At 2045 hours, Mrs. ______ Harrisonville, Mo. (telephone called to report what she thought was an object in the sky that resembled a “flying saucer over Harrisonville, Mo. All times that she remembers. The first occurrence was 3 week ago; the next time was last Friday, 10 Feb 56; and again tonight, 13 Feb 56. The first time she saw the object she thought it was not very important and immaterial but after seeing this object 2 other times, she thought she'd notify someone. She stated that the strange-looking object resembled a flying saucer that was very bright and moving slowly. The first time she saw this object it came from the east and then disappeared to the north. Tonight she said the object made a circle pattern over Harrisonville, Mo., and then disappeared to the east. She said that the object was brighter than any star in the sky and when it disappeared, it did not fall out of sight like a star."

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICER:

There are many types of conventional and jet aircraft operating in the vicinity of Harrisonville, Mo. It is probable that what Mrs. actually saw were aircraft. (Information required by par 7d, AFR 200-2 is not available to this hq.)
