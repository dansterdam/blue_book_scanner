11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Object was observed at 9:00 PM on 15 Jul. 53 and was a clear night with some high clouds. The object was first observed at an azimuth of 270 degrees and an elevation of 45 degrees. It maintained a constant course and speed and appeared to be a single white light. It was lost from sight after approximately 5 minutes. The observation matched the description of a probable meteor.

The image contains two sketches related to the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The first sketch shows the curved trajectory of the object above the horizon, with instructions to mark the position "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows two larger illustrations, one depicting a road with surrounding trees and buildings, and the other showing a landscape with a person on a road. These sketches appear to be examples of how to complete the larger sketch based on the observer's sighting.

Transcribing the text in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

Transcription of the text:

On Sunday, July 15th, I was up on the roof & saw what I would call a saucer. It seemed about the size of a car & floated above the trees in the city. Suddenly it got faster & faster & went straight up out of sight. It made no sound & seemed to travel very fast. I watched it intently for a few seconds & called my wife to look but she saw nothing. It seemed to be metallic & glistened in the sun. I thought at the time it was some new type of military aircraft, but I have no idea what it could have been. There were no markings on it, & no vapor trail. To be truthful, when it first came to my attention, I could not believe my eyes, but I am quite sure of what I saw. I hope this information will be of some use to you.

I will now act as an OCR system and transcribe the text from the document:

I would not guess to state that it was faster, as any thing, but as a slattering state. As to what light I again would not guess. But if it was a light as I would now imagine, it would have been enormous.

That is almost exactly as appearance in the original photograph of the object last winter that was sent to Redwood field. When near the ground, they again came flying. But it what time the sky like they said I was there.

It is my personal opinion the Air Force has solved now those they are being, and this was no more than was of them. However, as I stated no written report is in waiting, this is my own impression and I do not also intend to give any further circulation to old yes, the time letter to P.M.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]

Dear sir:

I do not know what this should be addressed to, but may I present it to the right person.

Last night, Saturday, July 18, I went up on the roof of my apartment as very late in one apartment here in downtown Brooklyn I saw what appeared to be a colored light. It was not red, blue, green or white, but more like a pearly color. It was not at all near a small plane or anything I have ever seen before.

It seemed to get out of sight very fast and just before it disappeared I thought I saw it go a little to the right. I follow it until it was out of sight and just before it was lost to me my vision was blurred.

It came from the east, north-east and moved in a straight line very swiftly. What could that thing be? I would not report it if I was not sure of what I saw. It seemed to me to be very high up and faster than any plane I have ever seen.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]"

From the time I saw it, it made it possible from sight, it did not move itself with any motion of a short-distance star - but it did itself thoughtfully. Then the second of pastel colored. I could not distinguish to any size or movement. For a while, when I held saw it, more which it again a kind, that is tall, it would on - and yet it all, neither from a move nor a sound - just like it was not there.

I said it was tremendously bright. As it was passing along, I could see what  quite more in sight, that a fireball would. 
And as a kind of a whole thing seemed to be well softened, and yet a time the little scar had. It was the size of this "I only tried in vain that go little scar. "

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand, and at about arm's length?

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22.

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Lost in haze, suddenly went off in a new direction, etc.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to Imagine show you would describe this object or objects which you saw. Of what type would this object appear to be, and what characteristics would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

As I viewed it, it appeared to be a disc shaped object that seemed to move silently and effortlessly across the sky. It would sometimes change direction abruptly, but maintained a steady, smooth pace. The object was bright and metallic, reflecting the sunlight. It seemed large, perhaps the size of a car, but it was difficult to judge the exact size given the distance. The object did not make any sound that I could hear. I have no explanation for what it was, but it did not resemble any aircraft that I'm familiar with. The way it moved and its unusual appearance made it stand out starkly against the clear sky.
