SUMMARY OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT

Date of Sighting: 9 July 1957
Time of Sighting: 8:30 P.M.
Location of Sighting: Shiloh, Ohio
Duration of Sighting: 5 minutes
Number of Witnesses: 3

Observation:
Three witnesses reported seeing two bright objects in the sky for about 5 minutes. The objects were described as circular in shape, reddish-orange in color, and approximately 50 feet in diameter. The objects were observed to make a sharp 90 degree turn and then accelerate out of sight at a high rate of speed.

Evaluation:
The investigating officer concluded that the sighting was probably caused by two aircraft engaged in night training maneuvers. The sharp turn and high speed acceleration was consistent with typical aircraft movements.

DURATION: 8-10 seconds
ESTIMATED SIZE: 15-20 feet in diameter

DESCRIPTION: 
Between 2230-2300 hrs, the witness observed a bright, luminous object in the sky. The object appeared to be round in shape and was giving off a bright white light. The object moved rapidly in a zig-zag pattern and then disappeared. The witness was unable to estimate the speed or altitude of the object.

The witness appears to be sincere and there is no evidence of fabrication. The description of the object is consistent with other UFO reports. However, due to the lack of precise detail, the incident cannot be conclusively identified as an extraterrestrial craft.

On 6 July 1957, Mr. H. G. SWAUGER, Shiloh, Ohio, reported that he had found an unidentified object in his field. According to the report, the object was a dark, irregularly shaped rock, approximately 12 inches in diameter.

Mr. SWAUGER stated that he had discovered the object while plowing his field. He reported that the rock appeared to have a "glazed" surface and contained several small "holes" or indentations. Mr. SWAUGER collected the object and contacted the local authorities, who in turn notified the United States Air Force.

The object was subsequently transported to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for analysis. According to the report, laboratory examination revealed that the object was a common meteorite and did not contain any unusual or unidentified characteristics.
