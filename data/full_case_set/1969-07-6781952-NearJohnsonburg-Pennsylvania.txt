IF INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.

On the 26th of May at approximatly 10:30 PM. We were driving home from a visit with triends in Ridgway, Pa. While driving along Route 219 near the little town of Johnsonburg, Pa. I noticed a strange flickering light in the sky. At first I thought it might be one of those small aircraft that sometimes fly over the area. However, as we continued to watch it, we noticed that the light seemed to be hovering and changing color from a bright white to a reddish orange. It seemed to be about 200-300 feet in the air and moving very slowly. We observed it for about 5 minutes and then it suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. It was a quite unusal experience and we have no idea what it could have been. More pictures of the object were taken but are not available to me at this time. I will be happy to provide them if required. The sighting occurred on a very clear night and the object was easily visible against the dark sky.

Gentlemen:

We would appreciate your help in identifying an object we observed in the sky Friday, July 25 at about 11:30 P.M. We think it must have been a weather balloon but we are puzzled about the direction it was moving.

My husband and I were observing stars in an open field along Route 948 between Johnsonburg and Ridgway Pennsylvania. There had been heavy showers earlier in the evening, but at the time, the moon was shining and overhead some of the larger stars were visible. The object appeared after our attention was drawn to the north, just below the horizon. It appeared spherical, shining with a steady, blue-white light. It was larger than any satellites we have watched and its apparent speed was faster. 

It moved silently towards the west at the altitude of Arcturus, then turned to the south until we lost sight of it in the light of the moon. When it disappeared, it was heading south. During its course, it made several slight, sudden changes in direction without changing its speed. We have not seen it again although we have returned to the same spot at about the same time of night a number of times.
