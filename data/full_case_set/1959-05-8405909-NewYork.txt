UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location New York

Date 2 May 1959 Hour (Z) 2345 and 0106

WX Cloud overcast, wind 15 knots.

Description Three reports (1) Tear drop shape, shining, dissapeared with darkness. In sight 45 minutes. (2) Squarish at first, then round, size of silver dollar, bluish-white, moving in southwesterly direction. In sight 30 minutes. (3) Radar - had no logical sequence but most were within 35 N radius of Bradley Field. Permanent fade out after one hour eight minutes

Visual witness indicates a motion generally South East although all information indicates an east highlight Direction of Motion

Satellite: (ACGIN-4J3, Phone 69291) Object in view for more than one hour.

Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planets, etc) ruled out

Radar Analysis (ACFIN-4EL) same sequence but no specific data available
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc) 
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. possibly balloon
Other 
Evaluation of Source Reliability probably good.

Analysis and Conclusions INTEL PILOT INDICATES THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOVING SOUTH. IF THE OBJECT WAS A BALLOON ITS EVIDENCE INDICATES ITS VELOCITY WOULD MOSTLY HAVE RESULTED FROM ITS RELATIVE MOTION TO THE AIRCRAFT WHICH WAS NEARBY AFTER. THE RADAR SIGHTINGS WHICH TOOK PLACE LID TO ONE PLUS

Here is the extracted text from the document:

```
HOURS LATER SHOW THE OBJECT FURTHER
TO THE EAST BY APPROXIMATELY
50 NAUTICAL MILES. THIS INFLATION
AND THE REPORTED WIND VELOCITY OF 
APPROXIMATELY 40 K AND TOWARD THE
NORTHEAST TEND TO SUBSTANTIATE THE
BALLOON CONCLUSION.

THE ATIC CONCLUSION IS THAT
THE OBJECT OF THIS SIGHTING WAS 
PROBABLY A BALLOON.
