The image contains two elongated, dark shapes that appear to be photographic images. The text below the image describes the contents as "two sightings and immediately became invisible. Light blotted object 22 deg of object travel due to lighting condition. Magnetic pocket compass unfit for reading - 577-80 sec to impact see dir". This seems to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, discussing unidentified flying object sightings in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands.
