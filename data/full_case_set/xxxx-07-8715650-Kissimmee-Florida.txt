1. CASE - 5 - THE GROUP
2. LOCATION 
3. SOURCE
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION
7. COURSE
8. PHOTOS: C. YES
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: D. YES
10. CONCLUSION: THE OBJECT OBSERVED MAY HAVE BEEN A STAR OR PLANET VENUS AS THESE WERE VISIBLE IN THE AREA AT THE TIME. THEY APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY AND DID NOT MOVE APPRECIABLY DURING THE OBSERVATION PERIOD.  THEREFORE THIS SIGHTING IS CLASSIFIED AS BEING CAUSED BY A KNOWN NATURAL PHENOMENON.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: THE OBSERVERS WATCHED A GROUP OF POINTS OF LIGHT WHICH WERE AT FIRST THOUGHT TO BE UNUSUAL. HOWEVER, SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION INDICATES THESE WERE PROBABLY CELESTIAL OBJECTS WHICH ARE COMMON IN THE NIGHT SKY. REPORTED TO BE ABOUT 32 DEGREES IN THE EASTERN SKY.

The image contains a compass diagram and instructions related to sketching the motion of an observed UFO or object. There is no photograph present in this particular page of the document.

Transcribing the text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how low the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
