There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page of text from an old Project Blue Book document.

The text in the document reads as follows:

The object was moving from approximately North to approximately South at a very fast rate of speed. It was observed that it was traveling diagonally, slow, which would be the impression at the height it must have been traveling. The object did not seem to be falling, but was moving away from us at a great height that caused it to disappear.

I stopped the car on the pavement to watch the show for a minute or so. When I looked up to see if I could still observe it, it was gone. It had just disappeared. I was really just mystified about what I had seen. I immediately felt that it was not the atmosphere and were certainly going to hit the atmosphere and burn up. But also remembered that this was to have been a highly sophisticated and the first maneuver we saw this one as it showed 7:10 P.M.

I got a good look at it through the pavement with cars and trucks passing by it. the other direction I pulled off the Roadside and watched out the window where I had a fine view of it for about 10 minutes, but then it suddenly disappeared behind a black cloud and disappeared behind it. remember the long way and its speed, rapid acceleration and deceleration made for some strange and unexpected behavior as the objet to the time it disappeared over the horizon.

As we turned into the parking area, we saw the object re-appear and then change shape somewhat and disappeared out low on the horizon. It was blinking a dark red instead of the almost white color it had when I first observed it.

We atood out on the car and watched it again for a minute before I went in the house and told my wife what we were watching, thinking it to be the sun or planet. This did not seem right to us but we persuaded to do so. We watched it together for several minutes before the object, getting smaller and redder as it moved away toward the eastern horizon. I noted that by the time it could emerge on the other side it would be so far away and dim through the sky that we would be unable to see any more.

I phoned my paper about it, but the editor claimed I was seeing an aircraft. I told him that whatever it was, it had moved so fast and so silently that it surely had not been an aircraft. He asked if I'd seen a comet. I had, from Malaysia, where they had carried calls, mostly that so-called UFO phenomena had been seen and thin at the end. The tail on this object was the same all the way back until it suddenly veered off at the end. The trail that it had made had been several miles long.

Text extracted from the document:

out in the atmosphere that there could be little doubt about it. For about its size, its height, its light, or whatever it was, apparently level flight, or movement, depending upon it -- in a very serious manner indeed, appeared completely to all of which, I say, a very serious minded gentleman, indeed."If you will, I'll give an addavits to all of it," he said.

U.F.O. ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: 5 miles E. of Celina. Tennessee
Date: 7 April 1952
Time: (4:30), 0:302
WX - 12,000' scattered, vis 30 mi miles
Description: Keen v/Atl. size of basketball at arms length, radish-white, lighted interior giving shape an outline. Moved slowly in diagonal (?) ascent for several minutes, then disappeared into cloud. Several minutes later it reappeared from behind the cloud, moved erratically, hovered, then went back into the cloud and disappeared.
Satellite: (AICWIN-429, Phone 69919) - Ruled out
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Coast. Planet, etc.) - Ruled out
Radar Analysis (AICWIN-429) - None
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.) - Ruled out
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. - Ruled out
Other - Insufficient
Evaluation of Source Reliability - Unreliable

Analysis and Conclusions: It is highly probable that these witnesses observed an aircraft under unusual atmospheric conditions. The rapid, erratic, hovering flight characteristics are typical of jet aircraft under special conditions. The variations in brightness and lighting effects are probably due to the attitudes of the aircraft reflecting the sun's rays, and the associated refracting of light by the atmosphere.

Sunday, April 10, 1960

T.P. Tharpe
Operations Officer
Tullahoma Air Force Station,
Tullahoma, Tennessee.

Dear Sir:

Attached are my thoughts on the sighting of fact about two balls of light sighted by a civilian in the Tullahoma area.

As you know a team of two NICAP members have thoroughly investigated the incident and their findings in the main substantiate the attached report.

I almost hesitate to contact you inasmuch as I believe we watched as long as the citizen did and some of the things observed speak for themselves. Namely, the manner in which the two lights reacted to one another and the way they hovered, moved about and finally disappeared into the distance almost straight up. The speed at which they moved and the fact that no sound was associated with their actions are some of the significant factors which in my opinion identify this as an unexplained aerial phenomenon.

It is my opinion, and I feel that the NICAP team would concur, that the incident merits further investigation, perhaps even the attention of your office itself.

If you have any questions or require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kindest regards.

Heading out to take Gross to spend the night with the family at Green Acres Inn, the first work to be done the next morning was to secure various items and equipment. As we came out of Highway 20 onto the Lee-side highway it was just a moment. It was brilliant against the evening sky, possibly the size of the moon at its lowest, but much brighter than any moon, and we could not judge the distance or height or diameter of the object. The height could not be judged, but later-possibly its intensity was lowered or no, although it thinks could disappear behind the clouds. It could have been 20 or 30 or 50 miles up. I'm no judge of such things. Any more than you can look at the moon and say how high it is.

The object was brilliant against the evening sky, possibly the size of the moon at its lowest, but much brighter than any moon. The observers could not judge the distance, height, or diameter of the object. The height could not be determined, but it is mentioned that the object's intensity may have lowered or it could have disappeared behind the clouds, and it could have been 20, 30 or 50 miles up.
