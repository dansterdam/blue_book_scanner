The object, dist equivalent to 4-6 miles, remained visible for 5-7 min. Appeared to be round to oval in shape, red in color, pulsating, oscillating up and down, side to side, but remaining in general area. Appeared to move towards the observers, then recede. After 5-7 min, it disappeared entirely.

RESULTED IN NEGATIVE REPORT ON AIRCRAFT IN GENERAL VICINITY
AT TIME OF SIGHTING. ITEM KILO: OFFICER PREPARING REPORT:
CAPTAIN JOHNNY W. SHARKEY, AG 59--42---, CHIEF OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
57TH AIR DIVISION, ALSO SECURITY CLASSIFICATION BECAUSE
OF DEFINITE OPINION OF OBSERVERS THAT THIS WAS NOT A BALLOON
AT THE TIME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELEASE AND SIGHTING, THERE
IS NO EVALUATED ANALYSIS OF THIS SIGHTING. HOWEVER, THESE
OFFICERS DID REPORT THIS IMMEDIATELY TO ADCC, MAWA AND
APPEARED TO BE MATURE, INTELLIGENT INDIVIDUALS, ESPECIALLY
IN THEIR PRESENTATION OF THEIR OBSERVATIONS. AT NO TIME DID
THEY HESITATE IN THEIR DESCRIPTION OF THE UFO AND WERE
POSITIVE OF ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY GAVE. SINCE ALL
THESE OFFICERS HAVE WITNESSED THE FLIGHT PATH OF SATELLITES
IT IS OFFERED THAT PERHAPS THIS UFO COULD HAVE BEEN THE PATH
OF A MISSILE, WHOSE FIRING DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THIS
OFFICE. THE OBSERVERS STATE THAT THE SPEED OF THIS UFO COULD
HAVE BEEN IN THE SUPERSONIC RANGE BUT OWING TO DARKNESS AND
LACK OF HORIZON-REFERENCE, THEY COULD NOT DEFINITELY ESTIMATE
THE SPEED.
