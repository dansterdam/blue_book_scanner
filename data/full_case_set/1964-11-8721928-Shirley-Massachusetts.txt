DEAR SIR:

I AM WRITING TO YOU ON A SUBJECT TO WHICH I KNOW YOU ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION CONCERNING THIS SUBJECT. LAST WEEK I VIEWED AN OBJECT WHICH SEEMED TO BE HOVERING IN WHAT WESTERN PART OF THE SKY. AT THE TIME I SAW THIS OBJECT THE VISIBILITY WAS PERFECT. ON WHAT EVER IT WAS IT SEEMED TO BE JUST ABOUT 50 OR 60 FEET COME OUT OF THE VASTNESS OF ABOUT 3 MILES OR SPORE. IT REMINDED ME VERY MUCH OF A ROMAN CANDLE. IT WAS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND RED AND BLUE COLORED SPARKS COMING FROM IT. SPEED THROUGH THE AIR APPEARED TO BE BEHIND IT THEN LEFT A TRAIL OR SMOKE BEHIND IT.

ON THIS.

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Shirley, Massachusetts, Nov 6*

TO: HQ USAF SAFOI PB
WASH D C

This office has received a report of an unidentified flying object from Shirley, Massachusetts. The following is a suggested reply:

Dear -----:
The object which you have described is similar to either a meteor or satellite decay. Several essential bits of information were omitted from your initial evaluation: the duration was not stated, nor was the size, distance through which the object passed. Satellite decays are often misinterpreted by the general public as unidentified flying objects or unusual aerial phenomena.

A satellite observation from Massachusetts would hold an association slightly longer that that associated with meteor observations.

Dear Miss [redacted],

The object which you have described is similar to others which have been the subject of information furnished to this office. The duration of the sighting was committed as well as the observations. The data for the aid distance vicinity within which the object passed. Observations by the direction of flight or rate of motion were not associated.

A satellite observation from Massachusetts would hold as unsatisfactory components and duration would be slightly longer than that associated with satellites.

Sincerely,
