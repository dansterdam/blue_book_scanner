The image contains two sketches. The first sketch depicts a curved line to show how high the observed object was above the horizon when it was first seen. The second sketch shows a person standing on a road in a rural area, with two inset sketches - one showing a partially obscured object in the sky, and the other showing a view of the horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to similar sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

SIGNATURE: <Signature redacted>
DATE: June 22 1958

First observed in the east early on the morning of April 14, 1958, appearing as a group of 14 bright reddish-orange lights or objects in a tight formation, traveling from west to east, and disappearing shortly after. Objects were observed by several people, including US Army and Air Force personnel stationed at the Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, Washington. Witnesses stated that the objects appeared to be several hundred feet above the ground and were moving at a high rate of speed. No sound was heard. Some witnesses claimed that the objects appeared to change in color and shape. The Air Force Radar at Fairchild Air Force Base did not pick up any unidentified objects at the time."

Transcribing the text from the document:

WERE THE CASE FIRST OBSERVED: Appearing in the east 5:30 AM.1 The witness watched it for approxi- mately one hour, and described the ob ject as oval in shape, about 50 ft. in length. It appeared to be a solid luminous mass that was drifting at times and at other times appeared to be moving rapidly at speeds estimated to be 800 to 1,000 mph. At times it would stop and hover and then shoot out at a terrific speed. The observer states he felt the object was under intelligent control, and that on occasion it would speed up and then slow down. He states that the object reflected a bluish white light, and that he heard no sound from it. As the object was moving, it would change positions in the sky, and at times appeared to be at approx. 10,000 ft., and at other times at approx. 15,000 ft. The observer was outside, and was watching the object through binoculars. The weather was clear, and the observer had an unobstructed view of the object. The observer is a retired Air Force officer with over 15 years experience as a jet pilot.

The text in the form reads: "On June 24, 1958, I seen several large orange shaped objects come in over the ocean at tremendous speed and go back out over the ocean. They came in at an extremely fast speed and made a zig-zag motion in the sky. About the size of a dime at arm's length, many times larger than a jet plane and more oval shaped than round. They seemed to be traveling about 3,000 miles an hour. This went on for about 30 minutes."

Mechanic, is this a normal movement, what is this like, is this as he expected? Something that happened, as it appeared. Perhaps the distance was such that some confusion arose, but I believe it that some something was observed. That may have been of interest, and a study of the situation might show that some unusual aerial phenomena was seen, which would merit further examination. But the passage does not provide any definitive conclusions, only a description of some event or observation that was made.

The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch shows a curved trajectory of an object in the sky, with the instructions to mark points "A" and "B" on the curve. The smaller sketches show a landscape view with a person walking on the road, and a close-up view of the curved trajectory of the object.

Now, as an OCR system, I will extract all the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

One night was watching what appear to be a light that look just like a star but and it seem to come right toward the house. Both fields in front and one divided by stone wall seem to light up fairly bright with an red glow. This was not military flight.

Dear [redacted]:

I am writing in reply to your query concerning your photographs. 
Shortly after your initial sighting, I sent a qualified officer to investigate the situation. His mission was to gather the photographs that you said and assist in their analysis.

Past records have shown that sightings such as you have made are usually attributed to natural phenomena. Even so, the Air Intelligence Service makes great pains to study all available information and photographs of unidentified objects. As you know, however, we have not received your photographs from the Intelligence people. Upon receipt, however, they will be forwarded to your residence.
