PROJECT "GRUDGE"

DETAILS:

1. This investigation is predicated upon a telephone conversation between Mr. G. T. TOWLES, Technical Intelligence Division, Headquarters, Air Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio and Mr. JOHN E. MORRILL of 5th District, Office of Special Investigations, regarding the claim of Mr. RALPH K. GASS, to the effect that he had seen four strange objects, one of which landed on an island extending 1 1/2 miles from the shoreline near Point Place and the Naval Armory on U. S. Route 25, between Monroe, Michigan and Toledo, Ohio.

2. On 23 June 1949, Mr. RALPH K. GASS, 812 North Erie Street, Toledo, Ohio was interviewed regarding strange objects he claims to have seen while en route from Monroe, Michigan to Toledo, Ohio and which he reported to the Research and Development Section, Department of the Navy on 23 June 1949. Mr. GASS stated in substance regarding the above mentioned incident with quotations as follows:

    a. After attending a gathering of his old shipmates at Monroe, Michigan he was returning to his home in Toledo, Ohio on U. S. Route 25 when he happened to look to the rear of his car and noticed an "object" in the air coming from a north-northeasternly direction. This object startled him and he looked again and then stopped his car, after which he observed three other similar objects. This occurred at 0432 hours on 23 June 1949. After stopping his car, he took his binoculars from the glove compartment and tried to the best of his ability to observe every detail of the "craft". Shortly after 0432 hours one of said "craft" landed on an unoccupied island which extends 1 1/2 miles from the shoreline into Lake Erie, between Point Place and the Naval Armory on U. S. Route 25.

    b. According to his observation, the "craft" had a "long extension landing gear built like a tripod, but with two units forward of the main spar and one aft. The craft that landed did not have wheels but hoof-shaped gear in place of wheels, with one hoof on each hydraulic landing gear. Each unit when extended seemed to be approximately eight feet long and while on the ground the craft set approximately five feet above the ground."

    c. "After the one craft landed a hatch opened from the port side of the craft and two men were observed to get out of the craft, one seeming to be a military officer since he wore shoulder-boards" on his uniform; the uniforms of the men appeared to be of a "Blue-grey color, one man wearing an officer's cap and the other an overseas cap; the two men "observed or military type" boots. Upon alighting from the craft, the man, Russian by Mr. Gass's belief in as officer, held a long stick which the second man filled with two handfuls of soil," after which both men re-entered the craft and closed the hatch, which appeared to be "hydraulically operated". After the hatch was closed the craft remained still for 30 seconds and then took off. The craft was on the ground for a "total of 4 1/2 or 5 minutes." Mr. GASS said that

PROJECT "GRUDGE"

While the one craft was on the ground he observed a "whinyin" sound, but c:uld
not determine whcter it came from the craft on the ground or the three craft
hovering above.

d. While the hatch was open he observed "a number of tubes running
at an angle of 70’ to 80’ down to the bottom o f the craft. The tubes were
located inside the hatch and seemed to be reaction chambers of some type, or
expansion chambers."

e. The craft "took off in a northwesterly direction with a 70’ angle
of ascent and was slow at the beginning with a sudden burst of speed upward."
After the craft had reached an altitude of "approximately 1200 feet" it joined
the three other craft which had been hovering above the island while the first
craft landed and the four aircraft then flew off, continuing in the northwesterly
direction "at an approximate speed of 600-650 miles, per hour, comparable to
an American Jet aircraft. Their speed increased at a rate which could not be
judged any further, but as a layman I judged the speed approximately 1600-
1900 miles per hour, or that of a super-sonic speed. The (four) craft dis­
appeared above the horizon at an altitude of approximately 5000 feet, and were
climbing at a steady rate" before they went out of sight.

f. From his observation, two of the three craft in the air were
made of stainless steel and the third was of a "bluish" cast, while the fourth
craft which landed was also made of stainless steel; the dimensions of these
objects or craft were "approximately 80 feet in length and 45 to 50 feet in
width; the profile of the craft resembled a flying section of an aircraft,
the thickness of which was eight to ten feet at the widest part", and the
weight of the aircraft was approximately 40 to 60 tone.

g. The control of the craft from a propulsion standpoint was
handled internally" and there was "no external trace of any jet or recip­
rocating engines."

h. The weather conditions were clear and the clouds were high, with
a ceiling of approximately 4000 feet.

i. He had called the city desk of the New York Daily Mirror, New
York City, at 0530 hours, 23 June 1949 and tried to relate his story to them
and was told that they were not interested in his story; he then called the
Research and Development Section of the Navy at Washington, D. C.

j. He held the rating of Fireman l/c in the Navy on an L.C.S. during
the war; his serial number was 7232106; he was discharged on 3 December 1947
with a 10% disability which was due to a nervous condition which he said had
improved since that time. He is a general machinist by trade but is unemployed
and is living on his disability pension.

3. During this interview, Mr. GASS was requested by this agent to make a
sketch of the object or craft which he claims to have seen. Mr. GASS fountered

to make a sketch of the craft at this time, but apparently didn't seem satis-
fied with his efforts and requested this agent to call back the next morning for
the sketch. Mr. GASS displayed the binoculars he used to observe the objects.
They bore the following information: "Monarch, Made in Tokyo, Japan, 6 x 25,
6163".

4. This agent requested Mr. GASS to accompany him to the location where
the strange object was supposed to have landed, and tentative arrangements were
made. It was agreed that Mr. GASS would call this agent the next morning (24
June 1949) when he was ready to proceed to that vicinity.

5. On 23 June 1949, after conducting the above interview with Mr. GASS,
this agent made a check of the Bureau of Identification and Records, Toledo
Police Department, Toledo, Ohio. Records revealed that RALPH K. GASS, 812
North Erie Street, Toledo, Ohio was listed as AWOL from the U. S. Navy on
30 October 1947. Filed with the records were fingerprints card and S. S.
Navy circular requesting arrest as a deserter offering $50.00 reward and
stating his serial number as 7230126. Also filed was another Navy circular
giving that RALPH K. GASS was apprehended 20 December 1947 by the U. S.
Navy. Records also revealed that RALPH K. GASS was born 26 August 1924 at
Toledo, Ohio.

6. At approximately 0300 hours, 24 June 1949, Mr. GASS made a telephone
call to the Lorraine Hotel, 12th & Jefferson Streets, Toledo, Ohio and informed
this agent that he would not be able to accompany the agent as requested since
he had broken the compass to his drawing set and would not be able to replace
it until the next morning. At this time Mr. GASS inquired whether it would be
suitable to wear "dungarees" on the previously mentioned trip to the island
where the objects were supposed to have landed.

7. On 24 June 1949, at 0830 hours this agent again contacted RALPH K.
GASS by telephone at his residence, 812 North Erie Street, Toledo, Ohio and
informed Mr. GASS that it would be impossible to make the trip to the vicinity
where the strange objects were supposed to have landed. During the convers-
ation this agent asked Mr. GASS if he had been able to make a sketch of the
object he claimed to have seen and Mr. GASS replied that he hadn't, but that
he could have one ready by 1130 hours that day.

8. On 24 June 1949, this agent interviewed Mr. L. E. GREER, Training
Specialist, Veteran's Administration, 501 Huron Street, Toledo 4, Ohio regard-
ing Mr. RALPH K. GASS. Mr. GREER stated that Mr. GASS had been in enlisted
status in the Navy from 10 November 1942 to 3 December 1947 and had spent
two years of this time overseas; that Mr. GASS had joined the Navy after com-
pleting his tenth year of school; that his disability at the time of separa-
tion from the Navy was 100%; that his Claim Number was 1217232A; his Social
Security Number was 270-20-1006; and that he had been receiving training at
the University of Toledo Junior College under Public Law 346. Mr. GREER
further stated that Mr. GASS had enrolled 2 February 1948 at the University
of Toledo Junior College and was taking an engineering course (day school,
12 hours per day); that his attendance at the school was bad; that he had

to be reinstated at two different times by two different professors; and that GASS finally left school at his own request on 15 April 1943. [Mr. GREER]
referred this agent to Dr. H. A. RICHARDSON, Chief, Out-Patient Service, Veterans Administration, also at that address, for further information.
Attached is an extract from VA Form 7-19021, dated 9 March 1948, regarding RALPH K. GASS, C-12-172-22H, which was obtained from Mr. GREER.

9. On 24 June 1949, this agent interviewed Dr. H. A. RICHARDSON, Chief, Out-Patient Service, Veterans Administration, 501 Huron Street, Toledo 4, Ohio, who reviewed his files on RALPH K. GASS and found that Mr. GASS had a service-connected rating, dated 1 February 1949, by the Veterans Administration of "30%, Psychoneurosis, anxiety state, and log fracture, left carpal navicular, post operative". Attached hereto is Veterans Administration letter dated 28 June 1949, signed by Dr. H. A. RICHARDSON, bearing the reference number 668S10, C-12 172 22H, GASS, RALPH KENNETH, to that effect.

10. On 24 June 1949, this agent interviewed Dr. Charles B. BONNEGLE[, Psychiatrist, Veterans Administration, 501 Huron Street, Toledo 4, Ohio, who reviewed the files on RALPH K. GASS and found that Mr. GASS had a moderate psychiatric disability. Attached hereto is "Transcript of N. P. Examination Conducted at V.A. Office on December 20, 1948" on RALPH K. GASS, Claim No. C-12 173 22H, which was obtained from Dr. BOHNEGLE.

11. On 24 June 1949, at 1130 hours, this agent proceeded to Mr. GASS's residence and upon arriving there found Mr. GASS had not made the sketch as promised, and after much persuasive discussion Mr. GASS consented to prepare the sketch which is attached hereto.

INCLOSURES:

1. Photostatic copy of sketch prepared by RALPH K. GASS, 612 North Erie Street, Toledo, Ohio.
2. Photostatic copy of SUMMARY OF MEDICAL DATA AVAILABLE IN C-FOLDER AND NOT OF RECORD ON RATING SHEET, extracted from VA Form 7-19021, dated 3-9-48
