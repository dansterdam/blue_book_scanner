PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 12 Feb 61
2. LOCATION: Between Sterling City and Garden City, Texas
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 2137L 
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: G Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: 0 Yes
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 6 minutes
7. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
8. COURSE: Straight
9. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Was a rotating, flashing, moving light, possibly balloon (2) Was atmospheric reflection, possible mirage (3) Was aircraft (4) Was Venus (possibly Astonomical)
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Green and white object observed 2137L, no sound, hovering, sometimes changing to orange, duration 15-20 seconds, disappeared to right or observer, then reappeared, disappeared again. On initial sighting with binoculars, object appeared to change from green to white occasionally changing to orange.
11. COMMENTS: Obj. of this sighting was not identified. Unusual, erratic movement and atmospheric refraction probably responsible for changing appearance. Strong for suspect increase and decrease could have been due to observer's estimate since differences in magnitude less than maximum seen.

J. NO KNOWLEDGE: THROUGH CONTROL AGENCIES OF TRAFFIC OR BALLOON RELEASES, HOWEVER, THERE ARE NUMEROUS UNSCHEDULED, UNCONTROLLED LIGHT PLANES KNOWN TO OPERATE IN THE AREA UNDER VFR CONDITIONS.
K. THIS REPORT WAS PREPARED BY MAJOR JACK H. CRAWFORD, AOC#41427, 3550TH PILOT TRAINING GROUP, WEBB AFB, TEXAS - MR. **********, WHO MADE THE INITIAL REPORT, AND MR. & MRS. **********, FATHER-IN-LAW AND MOTHER-IN-LAW OF MR. **********, REGARDING THAT THEY SAW ALL FOUR (4) PERSONS WHO SAW THE LIGHT WERE RIDING IN THE SAME CAR - THE SPEED OF THE CAR WAS NEVER BELOW 35 TO 40 M.P.H. - AND MR. ********** STATED THEY ROLLED A WINDOW DOWN. HOWEVER, MR. & MRS. ********** STATED A WINDOW WAS NEVER LOWERED.

PAGE FIVE RJWFDS 29 
LOWERED - THE ROAD ON WHICH THEY WERE DRIVING WAS ORIENTED GENERALLY EAST TO WEST, HOWEVER, THERE WERE TURNS AND DIPS IN THE ROAD. MR. ********** DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WAS SEEN WAS FAR MORE IMAGINATIVE AND COLORFUL THAN THE OLDER COUPLES DESCRIPTION. STATEMENTS MADE BY MR. ********** AS FACTUAL WERE FOUND TO BE CONTRADICTORY AND IN ONE CASE FALSE. A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WAS MADE INCLUDING THE MIDLAND U.S. WEATHER BUREAU, THE MIDLAND FLIGHT SERVICE STATION, EL PASO FLIGHT SERVICE CENTER, THE ABILENE SQUARE, WEBB AFB, DYESS AFB, HOWARD COUNTY AIRPORT, BIG SPRING TEXAS AND MIDLAND AIR TERMINAL. FLIGHT PLANS, UNUSUAL RADAR PLOTS AND ANY UNUSUAL AIR ACTIVITY WAS CHECKED WITH THE ABOVE AGENCIES. THE ONLY ITEM THAT MIGHT APPEAR A POSSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE THE NUMEROUS CIVILIAN TYPE AIRCRAFT WHICH FLY ABOUT AGENCIES.

The image does not contain any photograph or visual information. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document discusses a sighting report, suggesting that the most probable solution to the observed event would be the planet Venus, which was exceptionally brilliant at the time. The document also mentions the movement of the light and a thin cloud layer that could account for the appearance and disappearance of the light.

Transcription of the text in the document:

PREVIOUS SIGHTINGS AREA OF HIGH LANDS ON VFR UNCONTROLLED, UNPILED
FLIGHT PLANS.

THE MOST PROBABLE SOLUTION TO THIS SIGHTING WOULD BE THE PLANET
VENUS WHICH HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY BRILLIANT. THE MOVEMENT OF
THE AUTOMOBILE COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE APPARENT MOVEMENT OF THE
LIGHT AND THE THIN CLOUD LAYER COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE APPEARANCE
AND DISAPPEARANCE OF THE LIGHT.
