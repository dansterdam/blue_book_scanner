[Redacted]
Beaumont, Texas
March 7, 1957

Gentleman:

I have just finished reading an article in the Saturday Evening Post entitled "What You Can Believe About Flying Saucers". I am a sane young man 18, and I still don't believe what I saw last summer at High Island Block Co. summer village resort in the road to Galveston Texas.

I have never repeated this information to my buddies when were out at the creek or any of is anywhere.

Or, is in early June of 1956. It was very night.

---
it was not late, around midnight. when we went out for a guide
tour. The beach was deserted, except for a few lights in the nearby
cabins. As I neared the water I
heard a loud roaring noise---
and when I quickly looked 
back over my shoulder I saw
this object sailing over the 
telephone poles which run by the
highway. I have estimated at 
a twelve or thirteen feet span
and about the same length
spanning almost diametrically to
water at about a twenty mile

The image you've provided appears to contain hand-drawn sketches rather than photographs. There are two sketches that seem to represent different views of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The first sketch on the left is labeled "Top view" and it depicts a dome-shaped object with a protrusion on the top. The sketch on the right appears to show a side profile of a UFO with a more ellipsoidal shape and a line through the center, which could be representing either a division or a feature such as a ridge.

Below the sketches, there is handwritten text. Here is a transcription of the text:

---
Top view

This is about all of the information 
that I could supply you. But
I still don't believe what I saw

Sincerely yours,

[Redacted]
Beaumont, Texas.
