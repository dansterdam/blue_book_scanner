AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO: 2B-UFOB-5-55 PART FIVE
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was a rawlinsonde balloon hypothesis fit the circumstances of this sighting.
2. The Preparing Officer believes the balloon hypothesis fits the circumstances of this sighting.
1/20 Raymond T. Mymers, 1/21/55: The object sighted by USAF Everett Y. Wood, W/Officer, 17th Weather Sq., Bryan AFB, Texas, on 23 June 1954 was a rawlinsonde balloon released from the Bryan Air Force Base weather station, Bryan, Texas.
The characteristics of the balloon as described by the eyewitness are consistent with the normal flight pattern and behavior of a rawlinsonde balloon. The object was sighted at an altitude stated to be thirty (30,000) feet at all courses stated that the object was sighted at an altitude of 20,000 to 30,000 feet.  The object was under observation for a period of about 30 minutes, consistent with the normal flight time of a rawlinsonde balloon. Based on the above, the Preparing Officer believes that the object sighted was a rawlinsonde balloon.
The Bryan Air Force Base weather Station reported the following information for 23 June 1954:
Sky condition - clear
Winds - 230 degrees, 52 knots at 25,000 feet
230 degrees, 55 knots at 30,000 feet
The Preparing Officer contacted 6th Weather Rawlinsonde Department. Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, and received the following information:
Rawlinsonde balloons have been sighted with the naked eye after dark, up to altitudes of 80,000 feet, depending on the balloon's inflation rate and size of the balloon.  A light such as the one used for rawlinsonde observation could be very detectable at high altitudes when the balloon is at maximum inflation.
3. The Preparing Officer believes that the UFOB are one in the same.

I-B. RELIABILITY: SOURCE was questioned on the telephone as to physical features, ability to observe and ability to report intelligently. The information given by source has been verified by the investigator as far as is possible from the fields of weather and technical matters. In the opinion of the investigator, it would be difficult to establish the complete reliability of the source.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:

Last night at approximately 22450C, the observer noticed an object from observer tower located directly in front of him. The object was flying at an estimated speed of five hundred (500) to six hundred (600) miles per hour. Object was oval in shape and estimated to be two hundred (200) to two hundred and fifty (250) feet in diameter. Object was silver in color and shinny. Object maintained a steady (30) degree elevation. Object then reappeared in the southeast quadrant forty-five (45) seconds later and maintained a northerly course. Object was last sighted in the northwest at an approximate elevation of seventy (70) degrees and then disappearing at an approximate elevation of ten (10) degrees. Object would disappear for a ten (10) minute period of time and then reappear. Object was flying in a counter-clockwise circular flight path. Total elapsed time of sighting was thirty (30) minutes. Object was sighted at different intervals of time.

4-B. The observer did not attempt to make any action to change brightness, size, or speed of the object. The object was very clear and solid, similar to that of an aircraft with no apparent distinguishing features.

5. The observer was definite in his statements that the object did not make any sudden or abrupt maneuvers, nor did it leave any trail of smoke or fire.
