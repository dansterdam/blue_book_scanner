24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw,
we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that
you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be,
and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object
or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance
as the object which you saw.
Difficult to estimate size, alt., appearance, or distance - suppose
approx. 1/10 to 1/15 actual street 3 to 4ft diameter altitude,
-tie cotton less course however same thickness. Shape of the
the picture less clear not clear - there was structure at the 
time - 375 ft total position of view together with 2
