I have had type of aircraft and the possibility of seeing unidentified objects floating through the sky. I don't recall having a specific incident to report, however. The behavior has normally been like a very small bright light, not like a large object maneuvering but rather what appears to be a star-like point of light that may blink out or move erratically for a brief time and then disappear. I haven't observed anything that I would consider to be a very unusual sighting, but I do occasionally notice things in the sky that catch my attention, though they are usually over very quickly and I am not able to get a good look at them. I just wanted to mention this as background information.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?

Aug 27, 1966
Dear Sir,
On August 22, 1966, I wrote you a report about an incident which occurred on August 18, 1966, at 10:00 P. M. This involved an object which I observed through a window of my home.
At this time, I wish to advise you that on August 23, 1966, at approximately 11:30 P. M., I again observed an unusual object in the sky from my home. This object appeared to be circular in shape and had flashing lights around the outside edge. The object seemed to be hovering in one position for several minutes, then it slowly moved off in a Northeasterly direction, finally disappearing from sight. 
The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes and there were no other lights in the sky at the time. I have no explanation for what I observed and I am quite puzzled by it.
Please let me know if you have any further questions regarding this matter.
Yours truly,
[Signature redacted]

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten letter or document, possibly related to a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Dear Sir:

This letter is in reference to the fact that I saw an unidentified flying object on the evening of August 7, 1966 at about 8:00 to 8:30 o'clock pm. The object was sighted over Harvard, Massachusetts.

The object appeared to be disc-shaped and was completely silent. It seemed to be hovering and then moved off rapidly toward the north. The object was visible for approximately 5 to 7 minutes.

I am a careful observer and have had some experience in observing aircraft. This object did not resemble any aircraft I have ever seen. It was much larger than a conventional airplane and moved with incredible speed and maneuverability.

I would appreciate it if you would investigate this sighting and let me know if you have any information about unidentified objects observed in this area on that date.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely part of a Project Blue Book report.

The text in the document is as follows:

"Attention is directed to the remarkable observations and experiences of Miss Edith Rowe of Harvard, Massachusetts, 12 Harvard Street. On August 6, 1966, at or about 10:15 P.M., Miss Rowe was preparing for bed in her home when she observed an unusual luminous object in the sky. Miss Rowe states that the object was approximately 100 yards away, approximately 100 feet in diameter, and appeared to hover silently above the horizon at an altitude of about 200 feet. The object was described as 'luminous', 'glowing' and 'rainbow-colored' with a circular, saucer-shaped appearance. After several minutes of observation, the object suddenly accelerated upward at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view. Miss Rowe states that she was both startled and frightened by the experience, but was able to observe the object in detail, as it was in full view and well-illuminated. Miss Rowe is a sober, reliable witness and has no history of imaginative or fanciful reports. Her observation appears to be that of a genuine unidentified aerial phenomenon."

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document or report.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

Kell was about thirty feet away behind a small hill, his wife was about fifty feet away also behind a hill. They observed a strange object about sixty feet in diameter hovering about four hundred feet above the ground. The object was round in shape and appeared to be a metallic silver color. It remained stationary for about two minutes and then suddenly shot upward at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. 

The couple was quite shaken by the experience. They immediately reported the sighting to the local authorities and to Project Blue Book. The report was investigated and found to be credible, with no logical explanation for the strange object observed that night.

- page 17 -

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a handwritten document or report.

The text in the document says:

"This was the report about the sighting which occurred to me and my wife on the evening of August 8, 1966 in Harvard, Mass. We were returning home from a trip to New York City and were about 30 miles from our home when we noticed an object in the sky which seemed to be traveling at a very rapid rate of speed at an altitude of approximately 2000-3000 feet. The object was bright white in color and shaped like a half moon. It was moving in a southerly direction across the sky. After watching it for a few seconds it seemed to suddenly stop and then resume its southerly movement. It was visible for approximately 1 minute. We were both quite impressed by what we had seen and felt that it was some type of Unidentified Flying Object. We reported the incident to the United States Air Force and a representative came to our home and interviewed us about the sighting. The representative seemed to be interested in what we had observed and requested that we submit this written report of the incident. This is the report that I am now submitting to the Department of the Air Force."

- page 18 -

The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now transcribe the text found in the document:

The name indicates these people are or may be the ones responsible for unusual aerial sightings as reported in the newspapers over the past few years. These incidents are usually called "UFO's" or "flying saucers". The report itself indicates a careful and thorough investigation was made, but the results are inconclusive. 

There is a great deal of reliable data on hand concerning the nature, characteristics and possible origin of these "objects", whatever they may be. They appear to be structured craft, intelligently guided, but their true nature and purpose remains unknown. The only conclusion that can be drawn at this time is that they represent a phenomenon worthy of continued careful study and investigation.

I recommend that this report be carefully reviewed and filed for future reference. Any additional information or evidence that may come to light should be promptly evaluated and incorporated into our knowledge base. The public interest and concern in this matter is likely to continue, and we must be prepared to respond with authoritative and credible information.

SIGHTING REPORT
HARVARD, MASSACHUSETTS
AUGUST 8, 1966

Mtr.s Harrington called at 9:00 p.m.
to report that her husband Bill, while
driving home from work, had seen an un
usual aerial object. According to Mrs.
Harrington, her husband had called her
immediately after seeing the object to
report his sighting.

Mrs. Harrington stated that her husband
had been driving on Route 111 near
Harvard, Massachusetts at approximately
8:00 p.m. when he first noticed a bright
light in the sky. As he continued to
drive, the light seemed to move closer
to the automobile. Mrs. Harrington said
that her husband described the object
as being shaped like a disc and appar
ently rotating as it moved. The object
was reported to have been brightly illu
minated, emitting a pulsating white light.

According to Mrs. Harrington, her husband
followed the object for some distance,
estimating its speed at approximately
40-45 mph. The object was reported to
have made several abrupt changes in
direction before ascending rapidly and
disappearing from sight.

Transcription of the text:

"At 9:22 a.m. - 
A small object appear to be a cloud in the sky, rapidly descend
It seemed to be falling and vanished from view completely. We 
observed this for about 15 seconds. The object in the air was
triangular in shape and appeared to be a metallic or chrome-like
surface as it reflected the sunlight. The object descended 
vertically and the rapid descent and vanishing act was most
interesting. - Quite remarkable - very, the effect nearly
mystical, where a light having ball retracted.

P S Some of the meteorological observation that could
perhaps explain the phenomena."

24. Date you completed this questionnaire: 22 March 1967
25. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: 
A: a round luminous object was observed, quite close and low in the north-northwest sky on March 22, 1967 at about 9:00 PM EST. It was observed for about 2-3 minutes. The object appeared to be a bright, luminescent sphere, about the size of a basketball seen from a distance of several hundred yards. It moved slowly across the sky from west to east, without any visible means of propulsion. There were no other lights or markings visible on the object. It just dimly glowed, and finally moved out of sight. There were no sounds heard associated with this observation. This is the first incident of this type that has occurred in this area, to my knowledge. I have no idea what this object may have been, but it did not fit any of the normal patterns of aircraft, satellites, or other known phenomena. I simply observed something quite unusual and unexplainable. I would be glad to discuss this further if you feel it would be worthwhile.

Charlie Mr. Hadley related the U.F.O. sighting near the U. S. building, a town with a newspaper, also a second sighting that evening, this was around 8:30 PM. He viewed the object clearly, it was about 25-30 feet in diameter, round, hovering or standing still, and had no lights. It made no noise as far as he could tell. He was alome at the time. 
This sighting lasted 5-10 minutes.
There of course would be a number of people around a newspaper building but none are known to have seen this object. I think about it and can't understand how come of the employees or residents around would not have been put on this trail. 
One man more careful would have been handy, probably would have produced a valuable instrument. Some good photographs would have been highly desirable, this seems an excellent opportunity lost.

25 AUGUST 1966

Intelligence Officer
Project Blue Book
Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

On the date of 11 August 1966 at approximately 2200 hours a strange object
was sighted by myself in this vicinity. The object was viewed for the following reasons:

1. The object was hovering without any visible means of propulsion, such as
wings, tail or landing lights. (It had no visible means of support.)
2. The object emitted thunderstorm (which had a severe tornado sound) and
strobe-like flashing lights all around its very high velocity turns.
3. The complete shape was visible in spite of the very adverse weather
conditions obscuring it in shape, see below:

The above plus my knowledge of aircraft gained from Civil Air Patrol and experience that this object was nothing that we would
send aloft, especially in that severe weather.

Below you will find the exact details of the sighting and the
object to the best of my knowledge.

Shape: Saucer-shaped
Color: Diam-white amber Center-gray amber
Size: Approximately 30 feet diameter. Wings about 45 feet
Speed: Approximately 600 to 700 mph ground speed
Noise: At times a thunderstorm - no prop or jet sound noticeable
Maneuvers: Extremely erratic, constant turns, up and down - perfect curve at times 
Also it seemed to attract a very large lightning bolt. It was temporarily blinded me, the
object was not affected at all.

Location: Approximately 2 miles from highway route "/2 thunderstorm at the
time and rain in excess of 1 inch per hour. The object cut across
Rt. 2 at this point, then made its turn and continued westward,
alternating between hovering and very high velocity turns of such a
short radius that it resembled the maneuvers of the saucers.

I hope that the above information has been helpful to you. I will be
glad to answer any questions that I am able, if positive identification
can be made, I would appreciate knowing the type of aircraft.

Thank you for your consideration.

Background information on UFO sighting by Mrs. _________

Reference the UFO sighting by ___________ in August 1966. A study of the subjective information submitted did not reveal the actual stimulus for her observation. Due to the late receipt of the information, it is not possible, at this time, to make a comparative investigation of the activity since records are normally destroyed three months after their utilization. In addition, the lack of a specific date prevents a meaningful check of satellite schedules.

No direct correlation can be established between the buzzing sound and the observance of the alleged UFO. We are not in a position to advise Mrs. ____________ against shooting a UFO; however, it would be inadvisable for her to committed law enforcement officers before taking such action. It should be pointed out that many UFOs have been determined to be aircraft. There is a federal law against firing at aircraft.

DRAFT

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

We have completed our investigation of your unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting in August 1966. A study of the subjective information submitted did not reveal the actual stimulus for your observation. Due to the late receipt of the information, it is not possible at this time to make a comprehensive investigation of air activity since records are normally destroyed three months after their utilization. In addition, the lack of a specific date prevents a meaningful check of satellite schedules.

No direct correlation can be established between the buzzing sound and the observance of the alleged UFO. We are not in a position to advise you on shooting a UFO; however, it would be wise to consult law enforcement officers before taking such action. It should be pointed out that many UFOs have been determined to be airplanes and there is a federal law against firing at them.

Sincerely,

As night set in, we saw the object disappearing, but it had a strange light, about the size of a basketball, and it would change colors from red to white to blue - very strange. It appeared about the size of a basketball about 5 or 6 miles away, and it was moving very slowly, almost stationary. I had a strange feeling about the object, and I don't know what it was. I tried to follow it with my car, but it just disappeared. I don't know what it was, but it was very strange and I have never seen anything like it before. They appeared about the size of an ordinary basketball, about 5 or 6 miles away, and they changed colors from red to white to blue, which was very strange. I don't know what they were, but they were not ordinary aircraft, and I have never seen anything like them before.

to go like day, (to soon enough) and a friend came down to look first for this craft and to take film pictures of its when and where it landed because the witness (he) saw to large humanoid like figures come out of this landed craft and walk around beside it, and after a short while go back into the craft which then took off straight up out of the sight in a moment.

so I wanted day this sighting with your group, and men at arms have told this and as a witness, sighting case, that could not be explained of the ordinary type and not a hoax according to men at arms and also by this witness who is a very credible person. As soon you can, please give me your opinion on this sighting case per your findings to me directly via either mail or phone when your convenience.

Also have enclosed photos as promised, but some of them have spots and marks which could not be removed with out destroying the contents of photos more.

so I am asking your group to examine these photos of this case per your best ability and give me your professional opinion.

Here is the text from the document:

I had my attention attracted and I did not immediately see that which I first noticed. It was not a star or a conventional type of light, but a large, slowly moving, hazy object that first looked like a lighted airship or dirigible, but was not either of those. It moved silently and slowly across the sky for some minutes, finally disappearing. I did not have time to get binoculars or a camera, but I am quite certain that what I saw was not any conventional type of aircraft or light. I am a retired Naval officer and astronomer, and while I cannot explain what I saw, I am certain it was not anything of a normal nature. VCAP and Science and Mechanics Magazine might be interested in knowing of this unusual sight. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely,

Whenever the teacher speaks I read this book because nearly every take place on the subject of U.F.O.S and each time we see a object that is unusual over the lake they say s unusual looking object hover over the lake and somewhat like the ones we see here what I my would not are we. 

In bad weather of August 15, 1966 at 2:45 Aug. 4 it was lying flat on my back seeing the stars shine brightly above me when I has-tily saw in the corner of my eye an unusual object flew across the sky in a straight angle. It was a unusually bright light that looked like the moon. Then I went into our family room to see if my thought was right. It was not however because the moon was my thought and why I couldn'tin the other room. Then a strange light appearded.then the light disappeared, the light went away and they disappeared until 3 am in the morning. They were brighter than any dog I had ever seen.

Dear Mr. 
This replies to your letter of May 8, 1967 in which you request information on your observation of August 1966.
We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will file your letter for information purposes. At this late date it would be impractical to undertake a detailed investigation. It is important that a witness report his or her observation as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force installation. This enables Air Force analysts to perform a comprehensive investigation.
Your interest in the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects is appreciated.

Dear Sirs:
I am reading a book about project blue book and find it most interesting. I am even an our teacher. One girl and five others saw an unusual event take place on the hill last summer. There is a lake called Pish lake where mile they were looking over at a trailer camp. As the girls saw the tube go over the lake and suck water out, what this was I don't know. I do not know would not.
In bed when 11 or a sudden it the ground there was a strange sound and three objects appeared. They stopped and one could see through them. One could move a bit. I could not because the moon was in the south and the object was in the north. Then I found that my dog was hysterical and could not move a bit. All of a sudden back it went appeared and could move. Then it went away. Ever since then my dog has had attacks. The next morning I told my mom she said I was dreaming. But I yen not I swear I was not what it was I do not know and I will never forget it!!!

Proposed reply to letter from May 26, 1967

Dear [Redacted],

This replies to your recent letter of May 26, 1967 in which you report your unidentified observation. At this late date, a meaningful scientific investigation is not possible on your sighting of August 1966.

It is important for an individual to report his observation to the nearest Air Force installation as soon as possible. This enables the base UFO investigator to perform a detailed on-the-spot investigation.

Normally, air activity records are destroyed after thirty days, says this. At this late date we would be unable to check for any air activity at the time of your sighting. We will add your information to the present data base.

Dear Sirs:
I am writing to tell my experience with U.F.O.'s.
One night in 1966 about 11:00 p.m. we saw a dark disc-shaped object and we started watching, out of his telescope and window. It was hovering above the trees and made no sound. At one point I heard a low buzzing sound but it may have been coming from somewhere else. The object was about 40 to 50 feet in diameter and stayed in the same position for about 15 minutes. Then it started to move slowly across the sky, without making any noise. It finally disappeared from sight. There were several of us watching this and we were quite amazed at what we saw. I hope this will be of some help to you.
Sincerely yours,
Washington D.C. 20330

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS UNDER WHICH IT APPEARS TO MOVE. The object - It was playing with our eyes in the way a child plays with a stick when you pretend to throw it and he runs after it. It did not seem to be powered by any jet or exhaust. It was completely silent. It appeared to have no means of propulsion that we could discern. It changed directions sharply, made sudden stops, hovered, and accelerated with amazing speed. I thought at first it might be a kite, but it was too high, too fast, and too erratic for a kite. I thought it might be a meteor or satellite, but it was far too maneuverable and far too low in the sky. NARRATIVE: I was moving with two friends between the hours of 8 and 9 P.M. EST on August 24, 1966, on Route 70-E in Harvard, Massachusetts. We were traveling in an automobile, heading west, when we noticed a bright light in the sky ahead of us and to the right. At first we thought it might be an aircraft, but as we got closer, we realized it was not an aircraft, since it was completely silent and seemed to be moving in a very unusual manner - making sudden stops and changes in direction. It appeared to be playing a sort of game with us, almost as though it were showing off or toying with our eyes. I stopped the car on the side of the road and we all got out to watch the object. It seemed to be approximately the size of a basketball at arm's length, and was very bright - almost blinding. It was either self-luminous or reflecting a great deal of light. The object was approximately 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground and 1 to 2 miles from our position. It was moving in an erratic, jerky fashion, first one way, then another, sometimes hovering, sometimes accelerating, then making a sudden stop. This continued for 5 to 10 minutes. At one point, it made a very rapid, nearly vertical descent, then stopped abruptly and returned to its previous course and altitude. Then it moved off rapidly to the east, accelerating to a high rate of speed and going out of sight. The weather was clear, with very light winds from the west. Visibility was excellent. There were scattered clouds in the sky at about 5,000 to 10,000 feet. No other aircraft were visible at the time, and we heard no sounds associated with the object.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now attempt to extract and output all the text found in the document:

they round and they curved down like that. They just seemed up slow like the rising sun. They had lights on them like those up there only they were going down. I saw the same as the others, just like those up here, only they were coming down. And it went down slowly and it seemed to be rotating, well I couldn't make them as big as they seemed to be. And it seemed to be some kind of a (Color) kind of a display. And it went down slowly and it seemed to me that there were three of them, that it wasn't just one but three. Do you know but the first one I saw (and I want to impress that) the first one I saw seemed to be larger than the other two, seemed to be rotating a little differently than the other two. And the other two seemed to be coming but in the rear of this, what you might say would be the leader. And they were about the same size, the other two, and they seemed to be coming down as though they were together. Now I don't know whether that was an actual fact but that's the way it appeared to me, as I said, just like three ships in line, you know, one in front of the other two, and the other two seem to be following. As they went down, it seemed to me that they were perhaps rotating or twisting a little but, you know, I really couldn't say for sure. They were just going down slowly and it seemed to me that they were about the same size, the other two, as the first one. Now, I'm not saying that's an absolute fact, that's just the way it appeared to me. As I said, the first one seemed a little larger and seemed to be rotating a little differently than the other two. And when they got down, well it seemed to me that they just sort of disappeared. I mean, they didn't go straight down, they just sort of, well I don't know, they just seemed to disappear. I couldn't really say, I mean, I couldn't make out exactly what happened, they just seemed to disappear. I was under the impression (Didn't look at it a man or anything did it?) no, not at all. It went right straight down, it wasn't anything like that, it wasn't anything like an aircraft or anything like that, it was just, well, I don't know, it was just like three ships coming down, you know, in a line, one in front of the other two, and the other two seeming to be following. I didn't see anything else, it wasn't anything like that at all. It wasn't anything like an aircraft, it wasn't anything like a helicopter, it wasn't anything like that. It was just, well, I don't know, I really can't describe it any better than that. It was just, well, it was just like three ships coming down, you know, one in front of the other two, and the other two seeming to be following. That's the best way I can describe it. I really couldn't say any more than that. I mean, it just, well, it just seemed to disappear, that's all I can say. I really couldn't make out exactly what happened.

Transcribing the text in the image:

the coming up of it for rather to the object it got smaller looked real small than four miles on the dark object(?) - you realize that when you turn away and look at it again it will disappear although you didn't see it go anywhere 
Cade did see the object move and it moved up and down but while watching it it went up and then back down again - said that the beam coming out of the object was more or less narrow
Mr. Cade said it was not unusual in shape and it did not see any change in its shape or color while it was in view - he said it seemed to be shining or reflecting lgt and appeared to be metallic
He did not see any port holes or doors and did not see any motion as of it going away or of anything like that - he only saw it for about three seconds - Mr. Cade seemed to be quite sure of what he saw but was unable to describe it more fully - Mrs. Cade did not see the object at all
They said that this thing -  the object - was in the sky in front of their house and seemed to be slightly lower than the top of the trees
They said it had a steady glow or light - a dull light of sort that was not blinking or flashing -  it just seemed to be shining or reflecting light -(asked Father Donnelley) as I would describe it it is a dull steady glow or light  - nothing flashing or blinking
It didn't seem to be very bright - quite dull or dim but still quite distinguishable - 
(asked Father Donnelley)If it was like a star only brighter - no not like a star only brighter -it had no twinkle or movement like a star - it was a steady unblinking glow or shimmer
(asked Father Donnelley) As you would describe it , what kind of a thing would you say it was? Well I would hesitate to speculate on what it was, but I would say that if I saw such a thing in the sky I would certainly wonder what it was. I could not say that it was any familiar object that I know of in the sky. Let me ask you - did it seem to be quite large, or rather small? They said it seemed to be quite small -slightly smaller than a dinner plate held at arm's length perhaps - about the size of a dinner plate perhaps
(asked Father Donnelley) Did you notice whether there was any sound or noise associated with it? No, there was no sound or noise at all - it was absolutely silent. If there had been any sound I am sure we would have noticed it. But there was no sound whatsoever.
(asked Father Donnelley)So this thing hovered or seemed to move up and down a little bit, but did not go anywhere else, and did not change in size or shape during the time you were able to observe it? That's correct - it just hovered up and down a little bit, but did not go anywhere else, and did not change in size or shape. It just seemed to hover there for a few seconds. When I first saw it I wondered if it was an airplane or satellite or something like that, but it soon became obvious that it was none of those familiar things. There was no noise, and it just hovered and changed elevation a little bit. Very puzzling. 
(asked Father Donnelley)What would you say was the total length of time that you were able to observe this object? Only about 3 seconds I would say - it was a very brief sighting. 
So in summary, you saw this small, metallic-appearing object hovering and changing elevation slightly, but not going anywhere, and with no noise - is that correct? Yes, that's a fair summary of what we saw. It was very puzzling, and we're not sure what to make of it.

(Time stopped me at 10 seconds.) (Case was about 10 seconds long.) This was the most unusual case occurred any of the witnesses seen a thing. No stars appeared brighter or changed in any way. No planes of satellites were seen. What it was that was seen can only say 5 miles away a small white light glowing like a star. It started to get brighter and brighter. Its was at first a stationary object then it began to move. It hovered over the trees for a few seconds. Then it started to move very fast in the trees and out of sight in few seconds. Witnesses said was looking very strange. One did get up and stepped a few feet to get a better look but the light disappeared as it went behind the trees. Two of the witnesses followed the light a short distance in a car but never seen it again. As to identification they are puzzled. Each one thought the other might know what it was. They can only say it was the strangest thing they ever seen and they know of no simple explanation for it. The air force was notified but they had no report at that time of any unidentified flying object in that area. That's about all the details I can give you. I don't know quite what to make of it. It was reported to the air force and I am passing the report along to you as received. If you have any other questions please let me know.

MOTIONAL REACTIONS ---
a. Heard 'my dent ye' soon from the house (wanted to see what was going on out there)
b. Got up and went out. Saw something going up over the trees toward the west - lit up like a star. Just a second saw it and it was gone. Ran back and bang and can up to see what was it. - This was a ball of fire like an airplane going up and then gone. Scared and sort of can back and then is seemed to be and went up to what we call it . Afraid, but was not too scared and put my head under the cover. I do know I did that. They were thinking that it might come again but it does not. Then after a while the light starts to disappear. date referred and was in before it was all over. With and trying to find out what it is and could not hear anything about it. I said because of the verification by
VERIFICATION PEOPLE -
The Station Manager of the City Police and Sheriff was queried concerning sighting and have
necessaty. However the Cooperation here we do not of the best and something could have happened in Cooperation here which we have not. and will be impossible direct time of the best. and is possible direct line of the best.

SOME ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION/TENTATIVE APPRAISAL AND POSSIBLE CONCLUSIONS. ---
Our little experience (one year's best scientific) Estimattly questioning
growing unaccounts and unsteady in descriptions. That is to say we are a rove
together can say does say a lot of most of the complexity and the impossible and quite
difficult to appraise and would not like to give any conclusion at this time. Because
of the hallucination by some persons simultaneously could be impossible since
hallucination is not typical of your every day experience. Our witness had no mental
disorder. However, a study of the witness' statements off tape and on shows indicate
that our witness may not have been quite clear about one particular object. And looks
like not. but we have not have not yet certain. Later said he sees height. about
second later said it was low. 
a.  could not be star or any other known planetaries later said two red lights. 
b. Up then said it was frontwards a later said is was going up backwards.
Time because - it the additional things we examined and the weight of consideration that
something going off and something came on the side and did not last. I don't imply now
that it did not happen, -because - it happened,. and there was a statement to
that effe.ct. I did not vary gas apparently however, how much was statent to a statement to
the contrary, - so hence conclusion - no certain, but considerable doubt.

As an officer of the USAF, I am in a position to authenticate a satel1ite, a characterised the local parabolic spotting reports (937-8855), and since they reported no object in the area for the time that I could have observed them. This time, 1921 to 1930, and I gave them my report. The main difference between this sighting and other known sightings that I have seen was that it was faint in color (less bright), possibly even a little darker than the normal stars, and that it did not appear to disappear, but drifted about three or four times as it descended towards the horizon, although it continued to move in the same course it had maintained from the moment I first saw it. As stated above, the officer who interviewed me assured me that there would be no further time. to the officer who interviewed me when I called...

At the end of about one minute, the object appeared to be growing fainter or fading which seemed to indicate it was traveling away from the observer. The object went up for about a minute, then disappeared from view. The object moved through the sky in a manner so slow that sometimes I had the impression it was standing still. The object was glowing steadily with a glow of the intensity of a dim star in a clear sky. It did not appear to trail any sparks or exhaust and made no sound whatsoever. When the object disappeared I felt that this was almost like one saw in science fiction movies, something takes off and just sort of fades away without a trace. While the object was still in view, I exclaimed that it appeared to be a Russian satellite simply because of the slowness of its movement and the steady glow without any sounds at that altitude. The object did not appear to be spinning or rotating at any time, it just moved slowly across the sky until it disappeared from view. If it was a satellite it must have been rather low in the atmosphere.

Dear Major Quintanilla,
This report is dated 8/27/66 and concerns a sighting that occurred on 8/24/66 in Harvard, Massachusetts.
SIGHTINGS CASE NO: 6-6-66 CATEGORY I
LOCATION: Harvard, Massachusetts
WEATHER: Clear, Project Blue Book Case
Dear Major Quintanilla,
This report is being forwarded to your office, along with an enclosure, for any evaluating you might wish to perform in connection with the investigation of this sighting.
About 11:30 p.m., 24 Aug 1966, a resident of Harvard, Massachusetts, a civilian, phoned the American Legion Post in Harvard, and reported sighting an unidentified object in the sky. The control officer there notified the local State Police about the sighting.
The witness, who was driving home on a country road about 2 miles from Harvard, stated that he saw a brightly lighted, oval object hovering over a field at an estimated altitude of 500 feet. The object was observed for about 5 minutes and then it suddenly accelerated and disappeared. The witness described the object as 20 to 25 feet in diameter, with a bright blue-white light around the rim, and a series of flashing lights in the center.
I have talked with the witness and find his report to be credible. He appears to be a reliable individual and his story is consistent. I am enclosing a copy of the State Police report for your information.
Sincerely,
Hector J. Quintanilla Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book

Mr. Richard Henry 
Rt. 2, Box 171 
Harvard, Mass.

Sighting report of UFO on Aug. 5, 1966. At approx 9:30 p.m., I was outside on my lawn looking up at the sky when I noticed a bright object hovering in the western sky. It was about 30 degrees off the horizon and appeared to be a steady white light. The object gradually moved to the northeast and disappeared over the horizon. The object appeared to be much larger than a star and was brighter than the surrounding stars. The object moved in a straight line and the flight was very steady. I observed the object for about 2-3 minutes before it disappeared. I have seen many unusual objects in the sky over the years but this is the first time I have ever seen anything like this.

Sincerely, 
Richard Henry

This information is continued in this report that is given to me immediately after the sighting while the incident was fresh in my memory. I had sighted and observed several minutes while out looking for a pet Cat who had wandered off near our house during the day. I had gone out with my husband to call the Cat and as we were standing in the driveway looking around we both noticed a strange object in the sky. It was a round metal disc shaped object hovering silently over the trees about one-quarter mile away. It was reflecting the sun's rays and appeared to be about thirty to forty feet in diameter. It hovered motionless for several minutes and then suddenly shot straight up at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. There was no sound heard at any time. After it disappeared we both stood there amazed and wondering what it could have been. It was not any type of aircraft that we are familiar with. I called the Air Force office the next day and reported what we had seen. The color of the object was a bright metallic gray.
The color of the position as the absolute immobility as the strange object hovered motionless for several minutes was most impressive. There was no vapor trail or any other sign of propulsion. The time that it was observed was 4:40 P.M. Daylight Savings time. The object would be completely without a drifting or oscillating motion of any kind. It just hovered perfectly still. After a few minutes it simply shot straight up at a very high rate of speed and disappeared. I am still amazed and perplexed as to what this strange object could have been. However, my wonderment far outweighs any desire for a close and detailed scrutiny of the object. All I desire is an explanation that will satisfy my curiosity.

above the edge of the cloud. It (the light) was farther away; it seemed to be still in the same relation to each other and still glowed with the distinctive intensity that had first attracted my attention. Suddenly, the intensity was getting less; the sun was coming up, all the clouds were a vivid pink, this light still remaining.

This light could hardly be seen. I had a strange desire to follow it up and put it where it went until it disappeared to observe it more. Unfortunately, the sky as filling up with morning light, so I could no longer see it.

Perhaps it was a reflection of something catching the rays of the sun, or perhaps it was an artificial object reflecting the sun's rays, or perhaps the light itself was artificial. But I watched this thing disappear into the sky at a much more rapid rate than the sun was rising. And twice during the time I observed it, it underwent a very rapid increase of brightness until they were too far in the distance to be seen.

Here are some notes from my notes taken at the time: we were told by two independent people and on questioning, unbelievable. The opinion carried by the assistant knows something, so it is intelligent. A spaceship carrying two glowing lights side by side was observed through 7x50 binoculars. We do not have such ships and those quoted the lights disappearing about 6:30, some ten minutes after the lights disappeared in the distance.

Gentlemen:

Yesterday a delegation of police officials and newspaper reporters came to our office to investigate the remains of an apparatus that had fallen from the sky. Apparently it was about 8 feet in diameter and saucer-shaped. It had remained suspended a few feet above the ground before falling on the edge of Lake Yarinacocha.

Witnesses had indicated that there was a transparent plastic balloon about a foot and a half in diameter attached to the device by three feet. There were also the remains of two resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors. Some of the parts apparently came from a small electric generator. The number 124 B 25 appeared on the circuit board.

We are not certain what type of device this was, but it is evident from the nature of the components that it was of an electronic nature. We would appreciate it if you would make an investigation of this incident and furnish us with any data that you may be able to obtain.

If you have any way 95 determining the place and date of the fall of this device, we would be glad to know. We feel that our neighbors in Yarinacocha would appreciate knowing the nature of this possible space phenomenon.

Respectfully Yours,

J. Wesley Swanson
Supt. of Radio Dept.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE
AIRGRAM

A-402 UNCLASSIFIED

TO: Department of State
FROM: AMEMBASSY RIO DE JANEIRO
SUBJECT: UFO sighting in the state of Sergipe, October 8, 1966

1. A summary of the reporting is as follows: In the evening of Oct. 8, at 10:20 p.m., a luminous object in the sky in the form of a saucer, which seemed to rotate around its own axis, was observed from a region between Aracaju and Nossa Senhora da Gloria, Sergipe. The object was of the size of the full moon, showing sometimes a beautiful blue coloration, and perfectly silent. At times it emitted red-orange rays, and after a certain time was observed to move upwards and vanish.

2. The Department may wish to bring the above to the attention of the University of Colorado's study group, as well as to USAF.

Gentlemen:

At 10:10 on the night of August 8, 1966, near Shutesbury, Vt., an object of the first magnitude was observed with the unaided eye. It moved silently and generally in a zig-zag direction. At 10:20, the object moved away rapidly at a sharp angle from the direction it had been traveling. 

Could you please tell me what this object was, or if not, could you tell me if you had other reports of it?

Thank you very much.

Sincerely yours,

SAFOLOGIC/Capt. Cassei/Jad/79079/21 Feb 67
Dear Mr. ------
Your letter of November 14, 1966 to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
concerning the observations made by this office for reply.
I honestlv believe that individuals must witness an unusual phenomenon
or clearly see objects that could not be explained to report the observations,
However, one must be extremely careful in accepting claims that relate
to the U.F.O. problem; this is a major source of misconception that has plagued the
public for many years. This is because some news media often
incites the public to make claims that are not supported by fact.
Moreover, from our experience, many of the sightings reported to us
of by many persons in these fields, none of whom have challenged Air Force
procedures and policies instituted in them, the more prosaic explanations-proven
vehicles, however, have not chosen to review our files.
It seems to me that persons that proposed that more detailed studies
are needed are the only information on which to base a scientific study
and an analysis of the scientific or intelligence value of a phenomenon should
be preceded by a complete study of the circumstances surrounding the case.
This requires the collection of all relevant scientific and technological data that could be channeled to research and
analysts for further needed utilization, in order to determine the nature
of the occurrences. Only a comprehensive, impartial study of the
Air Force that our plans is being visited by extraterrestrial vehicles.
In according to your observations, the basis of time involved before
reporting the sightings to the Air Force precludes a comprehensive evaluation. The information will most certainly be added to the present data being
assimilated.
Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force. I hope
you find this indicated material interesting.
Sincerely,

SAF-OICO/Mrs Cassell/pp/T90T9/20 Feb 67

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your letter of November 11, 1966 to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base concerning an unidentified object was referred to this office for reply.

I honestly believe that individuals must witness an unusual phenomenon on several occasions before they can be considered to report the observation. There is no living or withholding of information by the Air Force. All data in our files on UFO sightings is made available to the public upon request. The availability of these documents has been limited, however, and the public has not been afforded the opportunity to review much of the data. There are occasions when investigators from the Air Force and scientists have not chosen to review our files, as they consider the data to contain nothing sensational-prone material. However, have not chosen to review our files.

I regret to advise that the Air Force cannot furnish any definitive information on unidentified aerial vehicles. The only information on which we base a scientific study is that contained in Officer's Reports or investigations of Sightings. We have furnished all pertinent scientific and technological data that could be channeled to Research and Development for further study. UFOs continue to be a problem which cannot be clearly identified or discovered by only a few sightings. It is suggested that your observations, if substantiated, may be of interest to the Air Force that our planes is being visited by extraterrestrial vehicles.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force. I hope you find this reply helpful.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

Proposed reply to letter from 14 November 1966
Dear Mr. ******,
Referring to your letter of 14 November 1966 concerning your observations of a UFO, I honestly believe that individuals must witness an unusual phenomena or else they would not take the time and trouble to report the observation. I have no lying or withholding of information by the Air Force in regards to the UFO problem; this is a major misconception that has plagued the Project for years.

The only information on which to make a scientific study is that of an observer's experience. In no case has there been an instance where sightings have furnished scientific and technical data that could be channeled to Research and Development for their study and utilization. UFOs exist in reports, only; there has been no conclusive evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that our planet is being visited by extraterrestrial vehicles.

In regards to your observations, the lapse of time involved before reporting the sightings to the Air Force precludes a comprehensive evaluation. The information will most certainly be added to the present data base.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

WISCONSIN STATE UNIVERSITY

STEVENS POINT, WISCONSIN 54481

Nov. 14, 1966

Dear Sirs:

Enclosed are two copies of reports which I filed with NICAP. Aware of your official policy in regards to UFO reports, I did not intend to notify you of my sightings. However, when copies returned to me enclosed your records, I decided that I should notify you of what I have reported, since I know that you are seriously interested in UFO reports and that anything I can contribute may be of help to you.

I am sure the accuracy of reports you would make regardless of the accuracy of the report would be not for an instant to be doubted. I know that they will accept them as genuine balloons.

I have often wondered if you are aware of the ridiculous position you have put the people in in regards to this subject. It also illustrates in my opinion the lack of integrity we claim to have as scientists and men concerned about your public position about UFO's and am hopeful that you can find a way to recognize more actively the information they give us.

My first reaction to my report is one of doubt, let me say the word DOUBT. I have been acquainted with UFO's since 1947 when Kenneth Arnold's report appeared in the newspapers. I have always maintained an element of doubt about their actual existence. I have given this subject long turn consideration as I like most scientists in the early days remained skeptical and have insisted that they be written off as simply the product of imagination or the misidentification of some familiar terrestrial objects. It took me 19 years to see something that firmly convinced me that they are real and of extreme importance. I sincerely hope that you will prove their existence, for I feel they may hold a key of some value to you - if only in the determination of world pattern of movements of interest.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
