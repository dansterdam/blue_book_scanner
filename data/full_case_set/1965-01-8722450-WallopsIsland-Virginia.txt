5. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: At about 0145 on 6 October 1958 an unidentified object was observed for approximately 10-15 minutes near the Atlantic Ocean shore line northwest of the town of Wallace, Va. The object appeared to be about the size of a basketball at arm's length and seemed to be pulsating and swaying from side to side. No sound was heard.

UFO Observation: 3 Jan 65
31 Mar 65
NASA STATION 
WALLOPS ISLAND, VIRGINIA
Dear Sir,

There are certain conditions in information regarding your reported observation of an unidentified flying object over Wallops Island on 3 January 1965 which I should like to discuss with you further.
The object described by the witness at the missile launch had a relation to the flight of the missile. However, we feel that the witness may have misinterpreted the object due to existing conditions of the launch and the flight of the missile. This does not necessarily mean that the witness did not observe an object, but it may have been another aerial phenomena unrelated to the missile.

This office would be glad to discuss with you in detail the observation you made so that we may be able to determine more accurately what you observed. If you are willing, please let me know and we will arrange a convenient time for such a discussion.

Sincerely,

MAJOR QUINTANILLA, JR
CHIEF, AERIAL PHENOMENA BRANCH

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

There was no interception or immediate identification action possible because the object was observed for only a short period of time.

A check was made with the Air Traffic Control Facility in the Washington Terminal Area and the Wallops Island NASA Station area. They reported no aircraft operating in the vicinity of the sighting. 

This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert R. Doriss, USAFR Staff Officer, Data Centre, ADC and reviewed and distributed by Colonel McCaffrey, Commander, 1st Fighter Interceptor Squadron.

The observer was occupied with other duties after the initial firming and therefore was unable to make a more thorough check or observation. The sighting was reported to the ATIC Commander but he felt there was no reason to conduct a more detailed investigation because no physical evidence was reported to exist.

1. No physical evidence was reported to exist.

2. The observer was occupied with other duties after the initial sighting and therefore was unable to make a more thorough check or observation.

THE NEWSWRITER TOLD US THAT THE MAN "WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT HOSTILE," AND THAT HE FOUND THE SCIENTIST'S CLAIMS "VERY INTERESTING INDEED." WE AWAIT DEVELOPMENTS ON THIS MATTER WITH INTEREST.

REGARDING THE SAUCER FLAP IN VIRGINIA CONTINUES. Clippings are still pouring into our office from there, and a new wave of landing and low-level sightings is reported. THE CASE OF JANUARY 29TH, AT PORTSMOUTH, VA., WHICH STARTED THE FLAP, IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED CAREFULLY. THIS UFO HAD APPARENTLY LANDED IN A WOODED AREA, AND ITS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WAS FOUND ON THE GROUND. SOME OF THE DETAILS ARE STILL BEING CHECKED. MEANWHILE, ANOTHER CASE HAS OCCURRED NEAR THE APPALACHIAN RIVER, AT FREDERICKSBURG, VA. THIS OBJECT HAD HOVERED OVER A HIGHWAY, AND WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL WITNESSES. IT IS BEING INVESTIGATED. THE LATEST CASE TOOK PLACE AT DINWIDDIE, VA., WHEN A FARMER REPORTED THAT A LARGE DISC-SHAPED UFO HAD LANDED IN HIS FIELD. INVESTIGATION IS CONTINUING ON ALL THESE CASES.

[START_TEXT]
At Wallops Station, Va., one of America's NASA rocket launching facilities, a strange object, which seemed very close to the ground, was seen hovering there briefly on January 27, 1965. The incident was reported in the press and various news media.

It appears that about one fourth the size of the moon, whatever was seen hovering there for a few seconds at about 10:30 A.M. that morning apparently startled and impressed the scientists and technicians observing the scheduled rocket launching which was supposed to take place a little later that morning.

It is interesting to note that this incident as well as another previously unpublished UFO sighting which took place on November 3, 1959 were recently examined and analyzed in some detail by the officer in charge of the Blue Book project.

He comments: "In the first instance, the object was reportedly hovering about 150 feet above the ground for a period of 10 to 20 seconds and was observed by at least two persons - one who saw and later photographed it from the ground. The other, in the blockhouse, saw it through a window. It then apparently disappeared from sight. When the film was developed and examined, it was found that it had not recorded the object. In the second instance, the object, described as saucer-shaped and emitting a yellowish light, was seen by the control tower operator at an air force base for a period of about 5 minutes before it disappeared from view.

These newsletters are non-substative, and issued only as often as worthwhile matter is available. The present one is intended as a supplement to Saucer NEWS.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: In order to simplify our files, we always have all matter relating to a given case photostat only once for all correspondents. This means that if several persons are interested in the same case, the photostat will be issued only once, not sent separately to each. The original file remains on hand, not sent out. This will save much time, labor and expense.
