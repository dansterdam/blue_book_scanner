Incident #158 -- Provoport, Ohio -- 1 August 19[blacked out]
with two cessn[sic?]tations missing, (speed with which the
trail was:created and length of time involved in the formation.)
It is difficult to come to a definitive conclusion concern-the
origin of the object observed, but it is equally possible that
it was parts of some photo trail of a fireball. Fireball trails
have been known to act in the manner described. The witness states
that this spray was not like an anti-aircraft shell burst or a
vapor trail from a plane. He implies that the motion of the object
form[blacked out] the trail was very rapid, and that the distance was con-siderable, at least, nothing is said which is contrary to the
meteoric hypothesis.

The document contains three hand-drawn sketches near the bottom of the page. These sketches appear to illustrate the motion and behavior of an unidentified object as described in the text above them. The first sketch shows a curved, snake-like streak. The second sketch depicts a streak with both curved and straight sections. The third sketch appears to be an oval or circular shape with a smaller circle inside it, possibly representing the object's last observed position. The drawings are annotated with descriptions of the object's motion, including "Streak twisted and turned - suddenly disappeared" and a note about the last position, with an additional measurement stating "Width same - length estimated at 1 to 2 miles."

The text of the document is as follows:

"Observer noticed what appeared to be a small black cloud between two white ones. Seemed peculiar because the weather was clear and there were a few white clouds in the sky - but no other dark clouds or formations of any kind. The black cloud did not have any definite shape but looked like an anti-aircraft shell a few seconds after it explodes. Suddenly it stretched out into a wide streak with smaller vertical streaks, then frantically turned and twisted, moving into a different direction and disappearing. In lapse of four seconds, smoke burst appeared again spontaneously, approximately 270 yards, 900' circles moving ENE direction. Smoke pillar, or column, drew into a size of 7 feet in width narrowing again into a snake-like streak a mile or so in length which appeared to twist from a wide to a narrow streak and then back again changing direction as it twisted. Moving in westerly direction against light wind. Plainly visible also far away and very high, no sound heard. Seemed like a streak that would be made if a Flying Wing with several engines **** banking and turning and leaving contrail trails.

(Sanitized) was in the war and had seen a lot of anti-aircraft shells burst and many vapor trails from planes but had never observed anything like this. He states, 'It was so spontaneous like a rubber band which is round, then suddenly is stretched at length and twisted, and then disappears without a trace.'

Agent's Note: (Sanitized) drew the sketches below"

The image is a scanned document page, and it does not contain any photographs. It is a typed report with handwritten annotations and sketches. There are two sketches at the bottom of the document. The first sketch shows a trajectory indicating 'streak twisted and turned - suddenly disappeared' with a wavy line and an arrow. The second sketch illustrates the object's positions with two ellipses labeled "11th time - 1 month" and "1st position" with two lines indicating '115 miles [rad at 1st] - 3 miles'.

REPORT OF FINDINGS

(1) On 2 August 1943, _______, student, _________,
Columbus, Ohio, was interviewed concerning an unidentified phenomenon in
which he stated he had substance.

On Sunday, 1 August 1943, at approximately 2:00 p.m., I was driving
out ------- road with my family. I was about two miles west of
------- reservoir. I looked toward the northeast and could see what appeared to
be a small black cloud between two white clouds. This seemed very peculiar
to me because the north was clear and there were a few white clouds in
the sky and no other dark clouds or formations of any kind. The black cloud
did not have any definite shape but looked like an untwisted wool
and always near it had exploded. Suddenly it stretched out into a wide
streak with smaller vertical streaks, then it rapidly turned and twisted,
finally in a different direction it disappeared. In three or four seconds,
this was the approximate ship time. This most noticeable disappearance was
also where it first started from. Absolutely, a turn was very, very lost,
and dispersed rapidly, appearing again as a wide streak a mile or so in
length which appeared to twist from a side to a narrow streak and then back
again changing direction as it twisted. It appeared to be moving in a
westerly direction. Always still what wind and was plainly visible although
I would judge it was far away and very high. There's no sound and I can
therefore tell it was a streak that might appear at 279 miles or what the visual
illusion was banksity and turning into heavier exhaust trails. However, I was
more than familiar with planes and air action on shiny trails. I have heard of
when trails and heavy smoke lots of low-flying planes like this is very common.
I only saw it twice, because I was driving alone and almost had an accident,
not by the time I stopped my car I had lost track of it. It was so spontaneous,
quick like a rubber band which is round, then suddenly is stretched at length
and twisted, and then disappears without a trace. I flayed that it was very
high where the air is thin and that is why it disappeared so rapidly without
any trace remaining.

_____'s Notes: _______ drew the following sketches:

streak twisted and turned - suddenly disappeared.
