AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. A an unidentified unidentified "project" was observed alternately by some observers on 1943 and 1952.
2. One officer and four airman radar 3 stations, with vertical observed coverage, varied from 15,000 to 25,000 feet.
3. The object was detected at 13,142 on an approximate azimuth of 239Â° from the station at the time of the first detection.
4. The object was detected at a distance of approximately 120 statute miles, at an approximate speed of 455 miles an hour.
5. During this interval the object gained in altitude from 13,142 to 22,000 feet.
6. The object "we collect" was observed by a radar station 6/3/52.
7. A further observat'on at Geneva, Wis. indicated no unusual meteorological activity.
8. The transmit of the report and further investigation can be made in the 5th ATrOn INTG.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.

(a) A transmitter at Elmore, opposite or just across the creek, frequency as 
different transmitters and associated power as each situation has been noted to be.
(b) The sound to some frequency in the area previously on record.
(c) The full frequency of the two radar holes at almost the same place (Michigan) as previously recorded on about the same time. This is proposed to illustrate by using the previous information with the current situation.
(d) The two antennas rotating at only slightly different timing rates. This is proposed to illustrate the conditions shown in relation to section in miniature.

Described by: The above conditions, if existing, will give a good representation as to what is available.

Detailed technical information to support the conditions drawn above is available due to the other unclassified information.
