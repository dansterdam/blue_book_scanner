Transcription of the text in the document:

14 January 1951

Dear Mr.

Your letter has brought an inquiry of an investigative nature, and we appreciate your contribution bringing this to our attention.

That letter was by-product in a case which we were conducting and is considered a working document, not a final report. For this reason we cannot release the complete contents to you at this time, as it would be premature and could divulge information which is still under study.

Sincerely,

Enclosures:

OCR Text:

This object appeared to be
somewhat larger than a conventional aircraft and could be
seen at an altitude of approximately 500 ft. It made no sound
and was observed for approximately 15 minutes. The object
appeared to be metallic and reflected a brilliant light which
seemed to emanate from the entire surface. The object
maneuvered rapidly from side to side, then climbed at a sharp
angle and disappeared from sight.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: OBJECT OBSERVED AT A EXTREMELY LOW ALTITUDE, WHITE IN COLOR AND CIGAR SHAPED. RAN ON THE GROUND FOR ABOUT 200 YARDS WITH TRACES OF SOME FLUID. WITNESS WAS EXCITED AND FRIGHTENED BY THIS OBJECT. 
EVALUATION: CASE CATEGORY: PROBABLY METEOR (POSSIBLY)
CONCLUSION: THE WITNESS DID OBSERVE SOME UNUSUAL PHENOMENON, PROBABLY OF ASTRONOMICAL ORIGIN. THE DESCRIPTION SUGGESTS EITHER A METEOR OR A FIREBALL PASSING VERY LOW OVER THE AREA. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THAT THIS WAS AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL VEHICLE.
