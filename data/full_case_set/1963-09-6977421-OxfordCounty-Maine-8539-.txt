The image shows a black and white photograph of a man standing in a rural, outdoor setting. He is wearing a hat, shirt, and pants, and appears to be surveying or examining an area with some scattered debris or rubble on the ground around him. There are trees and what looks like a wooden structure or building in the background. The image does not contain any human faces that can be identified.

Here is the text found in the document:

INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
Report covering activities in connection with unidentified flying objects (UFO) sightings reported in the Oxford County, Maine area on September 6, 1963.

The attached photograph was taken by an unidentified witness who reported observing an unidentified flying object in the area at approximately 3:45 p.m. on September 6, 1963. The witness did not report seeing the object land, but did note disturbances on the ground in the vicinity where the object was observed.

Additional details are not available regarding the specifics of the sighting or the witness. The location of the photograph appears to be a rural area with some structures and vegetation.

The image does not contain a human face or any identifiable human features. It appears to be a black and white photograph of a hole or cavity in a tree trunk, showing the textured and irregular surface of the tree bark.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

On the afternoon of 8 September 1965, I interviewed the reporting witness, Mr. William Jones, concerning a reported unidentified flying object sighting on the evening of 6 September 1965.

SUMMARY OF INTERVIEW:

Mr. Jones stated that at approximately 7:30 pm on 6 September 1965, he was outside his home in Oxford County, Maine, when he observed a bright light in the sky to the southwest. The light appeared to be pulsating and changing colors from white to red to blue. Mr. Jones stated the object remained stationary for several minutes, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view in a northwesterly direction.

Mr. Jones described the object as oval in shape, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and estimated the altitude to be around 2,000 feet. He said there was no sound associated with the object.

I have found no evidence to contradict Mr. Jones' report. His description of the object and its behavior is consistent with other UFO reports from the area. Further investigation is pending.

OUTPUT TEXT:

AIRFORCE CASE NO. 63-8539

OXFORD COUNTY, MAINE
6 SEPTEMBER 1963

The witness, Mr. William Knox, reported that at approximately 7:55 PM, he and his wife were driving towards South Paris, Maine on Route 26 when they observed a brilliant, bluish-white light in the sky. The light appeared to be about 5 miles distant and at an estimated altitude of 1,000 feet. 

The light was described as being approximately the size of a golf ball held at arm's length and was seen for about 30 seconds before it abruptly disappeared. No sound was associated with the observation.

Investigator's comments: This sighting is typical of those which have been reported in the past, i.e., a bright light in the sky observed for a short period of time and then disappearing. The witness appears to be reliable and there is no indication of any other explanation for the sighting.

The image appears to show a black and white photograph of a rock formation or geological structure. The image depicts a large, irregularly shaped rock or boulder, with distinct striations or cracks running along its surface. The lighting and contrast create dramatic shadows, giving the rock a distinct and rugged appearance. There does not appear to be any human presence or faces visible in this image.
