The image does not contain any photographs, it is a scanned document from Project Blue Book titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT". The document provides details about a UFO sighting that occurred on April 29, 1952 near San Antonio, Texas. The text of the document is as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 

Commander, 3AANA 

On 29 April 1952, in accordance with AF letter 200-5, dated 29 April 1952, the following information is submitted:

(1) The object was saucer-shaped and smallin size. Only one object was observed. It was brownish-gray in color. The object moved back and forth erratically at a high rate of speed, sometimes pausing apparently stationary. It was silent and no trail or exhaust was observed. The object disappeared quickly, much in the same manner as it would a light-being extinguished. The elapsed time of observation was approximately 45 seconds.

(2) Object was observed 1945 hours, CST, 16 June 1953 for approximately five minutes. 

(3) A visual ground observation through 7x50 power binoculars was made.

(4) Observers were at their place of duty, the control tower at Kelly AFB, Texas. At the time of the sighting, the weather was clear and visibility was excellent.

(5) Observers were: 1/Lt Robert C. Sherwood, AF 1638301; A/2C Albert R. Kessel, AF 17107269; and A/1C William J. Paher, AF 15292492; all from the 1323rd AACS Unit stationed at Kelly AFB, Texas.

(6) Paet weather prevailed at the time of the sighting. Visibility was fifteen miles and temperature was approximately 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Six thousand feet reported.

(7) Compass sightings stated that due to the physical make up of the object that the sighting could be explained as the reflection of the sun on a high cirrus cloud.

(8) There is no physical evidence of the sighting.

(9) Local AC&W unit contacted with negative results. ATIC Center, San Antonio, Texas conducted VAS liaison with negative results.

(10) No air traffic reported in the general area at the time of the sighting.

STATEMENT

At approximately 1945 hours, 16 June 1953, I was on duty as a control tower operator, at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. The sun had just set and I was scanning the sky, keeping track of air traffic in the area, when I noticed an elliptical-shaped light that appeared to be suspended in the WNW sky. At first sight, I thought this light might possibly be an unidentified flying object, then I reasoned that it may have been the sun drawing water. This object gave the appearance of a light shining on a cloud or smoke. It appeared to be approximately the size of a regular envelope held at arms length. I observed this light through binoculars but could not see any additional detail. I notified the ACCU Squadron at Lackland AF Base but they reported nothing on their scopes. ABTC Center, San Antonio, was also notified with the same results. After watching the light for approximately five minutes, it suddenly disappeared. I am firmly convinced that the light was caused by the reflection of the sun on a high cirrus cloud.

I certify that this statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge:

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed statement describing a UFO sighting. The statement describes an incident that occurred on June 2, 1953 at around 10:20 PM, where the witness observed a streak of light in the sky that appeared to be a maneuvering object at a high altitude, as well as another similar object following behind it. The witness called her husband to come outside and view the objects as well. The statement concludes with the witness certifying that the information provided is true and correct to the best of her knowledge.

STATEMENT

At approximately 10:20 PM on 2 June 1953, I was out in the back yard hanging clothes on the line. At the time I was facing southeast. When placing a pin in the clothes, I happened to look up and saw a streak of light. At first I believed it to be a so called, falling star, but the unidentified object was continuing to move at what seemed to be an extremely high altitude and also another similar object was following behind it at some distance. I could hear no sound from the objects and they seemed to be going at a terrific speed. Immediately I called my husband and we went to the front yard. I showed him the direction they were going and he picked up into view the same thing I did.

As for the description of the objects and other pertinent information, I agree substantially with the facts stated by my husband.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge:

STATEMENT

About 10:20 PM on the night of June 2, 1953, my wife called me from the house to identify some objects in the sky. When I located the objects in the sky, there were two objects and seemed to be at a very high altitude, changing speeds at will, and moving in all directions. The objects, as I saw them, were yellow in color and were round. However, all I could see was the yellow color taking the shape of some round objects.

There were three objects in the air at one time traveling in different directions, i.e., circling, flying directly overhead, and zig-zagging motion. The total number of objects seen was six but there is a chance the three in the air at one time returned.

I called our next door neighbor, Capt. [redacted] US Army, to see his opinion on the sighted objects. My wife, [redacted], and myself were unable to identify the objects so I called Kelly Air Base and informed the Air Police Officer of the Day that such objects were in the air. After watching these objects for about an hour I again called the OD of the Air Police at Kelly for some information on these objects and he stated that he had informed security at Kelly of my sighting.

A few moments later I called Randolph Air Force Base and was connected with the Officer of the Day and informed him of the objects. He returned my call and stated that the objects were being sighted by him at that time and that he was trying to elucidate them more and find out where they were. He stated that the objects very definitely were not planes.

During the two hours that I watched the movement of the objects I called Lackland Air Craft and Warning Unit and reported to the officer in charge of what was being seen by myself, wife, and Capt. --------. The attitude of the officer in charge was certainly not one of very much concern over my report and his whole conversation and manner was one of extreme unimportance to such a report coming from a fellow air force officer. I would think that an officer in such an important position would be more alert to such reports than was exhibited by this officer.

The objects were seen for at least two hours and the last two of the objects were in formation moving in the direction toward Randolph Air Force Base. It was about 12:30 AM, June 3, 1953 when I last sighted the objects and I was getting ready to take more photographs if possible.

Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson,

Now that Jennie has her preliminary clearance, she can help me handle the reports and can type the letters to you and to your successor. This will improve the quality of the typing I am sure. I cannot guarantee spelling. (Neither can I.)

With respect to the two cases you sent us on June 23, there is only one thing to say: "The 21 June report-call was erren must be tossed out because of some difficulty determining data." On Austin there is a glimmer of anything interesting there which would just start pending further astronomical investigation. There seems to be some confusion left by our wire from A.T.I.C. with respect to the San Antonio case.

The San Antonio 16 June is clearly a meteorological phenomenon and one that would warm the heart of a skeptic. This was undoubtedly an augmented aerial optical phenomenon of the setting sun on a high cloud.

Referring to the follow-up statement on the 10 June Detroit case, both Jennie and I still think this was a landing light and area it could not have been a meteor.

I press ahead with reporting little, if any, progress. Jen is going ahead with requesting the air control tower operations increased in hoping to increased the quantity of reports here. Hope Jennie's clearance will not be too long in coming.

School. I hope we can see you soon and wish you a bon voyage into Law.

Sincerely,

Allen Hynek

UNCLASSIFIED
San Antonio, Texas
16 June 1953
Description
Several airmen in the control tower at Kelly Air Base observed on unidentified flying object at 3:10 p.m. for approximately 7 minutes. This object was elliptical shaped and appeared to be equal to the issues of a 2 by 3 inch envelope. No aerodynamic features, such as exhaust or propulsion system were noted. Object disappeared suddenly in much the same manner as would a light being extinguished. Observers stated that object was quite similar to a cloud or smoke through which a light was shining.
Discussion
A check with airfields in the vicinity determined that there were no aircraft in the area at the time of sighting. The local ACAW required no aircraft to be flying at that time. Due to the physical makeup of the object, this sighting could not be explained due to the reflection of the sun on a high cirrus cloud.  
Conclusion
Other - Probably light reflection on cloud.
