"Additional report:
This report came to me from a 59 year old credible citizen and resident of - - - Haverhill, N.H. who observed a strange object in the sky at about 8:00 p.m. EDT on 8 August 1963. The object was observed for about 10-15 minutes as it slowly moved across the sky in a northerly direction. It was reported as a large luminous object, circular in shape, and estimated to be 30-40 feet in diameter. The witness stated that it emitted a bright light and appeared to change color from white to blue-green. The object was observed through a telescope and the witness indicated that it appeared to have some type of structure within the bright light. No sound was heard. The witness is considered a reliable and credible observer."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book, with multiple fill-in-the-blank questions.

Text from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear, to you, as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In your own words can you give a clear picture as a person of what kind of object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the objects which you saw?
