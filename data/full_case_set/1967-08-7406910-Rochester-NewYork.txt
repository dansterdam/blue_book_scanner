This page from the Project Blue Book document contains a hand-drawn sketch and diagram, but no photographic image.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.

EXCUSE THE MISTAKES.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before? If so, give date and location.

YES, MANY TIMES BEFORE

31. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? (Circle One)
YES        NO

31.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object too? (Circle One)
YES        NO

32. Please give the following information about yourself:

NAME: [REDACTED]
ADDRESS: [REDACTED]
CITY: ROCHESTER    STATE: NEW YORK
TELEPHONE NUMBER: [REDACTED]

Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special interests which might be pertinent.

I have had many sightings of such objects over the past several years, which I have observed quite closely. My interest in the subject is strong and I have given considerable thought to the possibility that these objects represent some form of extra-terrestrial intelligences. I have discussed the matter with many persons, both local and national, and it seems to me that there is much more to this subject than the public is generally aware of. The instances of sightings are so numerous and the reports so consistent that it would appear to defy any normal explanation.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?

I DISCUSSED IT WITH SEVERAL FRIENDS, THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO BELIEVE ME FULLY.

WE SAW A LARGE. VLIKE. OBJECT APPEAR BRIEFLY THEN IT SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR. IT WAS ABOUT A TEL. SCOPE IN LENGTH ON A TRAJECTORY TO THE EAST. IT APPEARED IN SIZE BUT QUICKLY FADED OUT OF SIGHT. WHAT WOULD APPEAR TO BE ITS APPARENT SPEED WAS RAPID AND IT WOULD BE OF THE "BRIGHTER THAN THE STARS" HS THE WHOLE OBJECT TO BEHOLD AT IT OCCURRED. APPARENTLY IT WAS QUITE A DISTANCE AWAY. AT THE FIRST SIGHTING WE CAN ONLY DESCRIBE IT AS BEING LARGER THAN A STAR AND OF A MORE DEFINITE OUTLINE RATHER THAN JUST BEING ANOTHER STAR. IT APPEARED TO BE BRIGHT AND CLEAR, SORT OF SHINING RATHER THAN BEING ILLUMINATED LIKE SOME OF OUR MAN-MADE OBJECTS WHICH HAVE BEEN SEEN. IT APPEARED TO BE QUITE A DISTANCE AWAY. I HAVE FOUND, AFTER CHECKING CAREFULLY, THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH ANY SATELLITE OR AIRCRAFT THAT IS KNOWN TO US.

The object appeared to rotate on its own axis, and its light was steady, not blinking. There were no wings, tail, or other structure visible. After hovering for 5 minutes, the object then climbed rather rapidly into the sky and disappeared.
