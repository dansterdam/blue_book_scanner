The image appears to contain two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" and a curved line labeled "B", and instructs the viewer to imagine being at the point shown and placing "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when last seen.

The second sketch shows two larger scenes. The larger scene on the left depicts a road leading through a wooded area, with a person standing on the road. The smaller scene on the right depicts a silhouetted landscape with a curved horizon and something in the sky.

Text Extracted from the Document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

June 1963, Case 13 - This happened especially since it occurred in Dayton, a little more digging, the committee was shown the complete film record of object, even though no film was used, that probably corresponds to the time of launching or weather
Otherwise, in the first part of June, 1963, the committee is in remarkably good agreement. The arrangement is good. I wish we could have no meeting this week since I was in New Mexico and the father of one of the committee members died - Nancy Van Heussen family back on the ball this week and try to finish up this year fairly soon. Then back on the schedule like to come.

Cordially,

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing questions and instructions related to describing a sighting.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

NO CASES: Information Only
SOURCES: Flying Saucer Review, Nov-Dec 65

18-24 Jun 63
Andes Mts, Argentina

Between June 18 (Mendoza Area), a strange craft with red lights was sighted. It seemed to be hovering in the vicinity of the famous gigantic statue of Christ on the mountain. The object flew in a straight line, made some maneuvers and then disappeared behind the peaks at great speed. The party also saw strange flashes of light and there was much uneasy talk among the troops about flying unidentified objects. At one point, the area became blocked by very heavy snowfalls, it was impossible to communicate, and the party had to take shelter. It was some days before they could continue their mission. The incident corroborates other reports from the area that personnel of the Argentine and Chilean meteorological services have frequently observed mysterious moving lights. It would seem to confirm that this region of the Andes Mountains is a focal point of unidentified flying activity.

NO CASE (Information Only) 23 June 1963 
Source: FSYC (July 1963) Medina, Ohio
A lady in Medina, Ohio, which is near Cleveland, called the USAF and reported that she had seen an unidentified object at about 3:10 AM on 6/23/63. This object was observed by Mrs. M.M. Marvin Hall. Mrs. Hall described the object as a bright white color with pulsations or and bands rotating around the central body. The object was like a luminous band with two extension lights revolving about the central body. The object moved WNW and was last seen fading in intensity.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report or document discussing a sighting of some unidentified flying objects near Rockland, Massachusetts on June 26, 1963. The text describes the objects as being lighted, maneuvering, and moving in a path different from that of a commercial airliner. It also mentions that three objects were seen and tracked by witnesses over a period of time.

Here is the full text from the document:

Another "close-up" sighting was made on 26 June 1963 in Rockland, Mass. They were silitty con- trol their home when they say a lighted object with the same exact colors and light condition as reported in the Greenbush, Mass. incident. All three reported the object stopped at one point, then continued on its flight. The glow from the object emitted light orange and white, and followed an extremely irregular path, darting back and forth over its path. The flight path was choppy and irregular as in the photograph taken in Wellington, Mass on this date.
This object did appear to be close to them, but their statements to the sender said it appeared to be soiling back and forth over its path. "All three of the witnesses looked intently at the same lighted object for several minutes. The main reason we did so, was the large number of interested right angles taken by this object as it moved.." Wherever it went, it was the first time they had seen anything like it. The trio first saw it when a commercial airliner passed over their home, and all three objects were at a higher elevation than the airplane, tracing this irregular pattern.
