CONCLUSION, LANSING, MICHIGAN

Results of the field investigation in the Lansing, Michigan and surrounding area leads to the conclusion that no aircraft or aircraft under control of the USAF are involved. The sightings are believed to be the most likely cause of the turbulence observed in the area photography.

The sightings and associated noises on the night of 21 May, by multiple observers, are attributed to the siren and flasher reflecting from ground objects/areas.

The sightings of 22 May by and and on the night of 23 May are believed to be meteor observations.

The object observed on 25 May by is believed to have been the planet Venus.

The sighting of 26 May by is regarded as an unreliable report.

The sighting of Mr. on 27 May resembles a reported observation of the planet Venus.

The sighting on 1 Jun at Crystal Lake, Michigan by is believed to have been caused by an area-red photo emission.

The observation on 5 Jun near Lansing, Michigan is believed to have been aircraft.

The sighting on 13 Jun at Grand Ledge, Michigan is regarded as the reflection of car headlights on fog.

The report from Mrs. included leaves as a physical specimen. No object was observed. It is believed that Mrs. hand leaves are not associated with this event. Subsequent analysis revealed that the leaves are not radioluminescent.

SIGHTING OF STANLEY BRAUER AND DON WEIGANDT

Mr. Stanley Brauer and Mr. Don Weigandt were contacted to obtain details regarding an unidentified aerial object that was observed from their restaurant on the night of April 28, 1964. 

Mr. Weigandt stated that at approximately 8 PM, they went outside to investigate a noise and observed an object in the sky. The object was described as being about 75-100 feet in diameter and silently maneuvering. It would fade out and then reappear, often changing color from red to white. The observation lasted for about 5-10 minutes, during which time the object remained generally stationary.

Later, at 1:15 AM the following morning, Mr. Brauer and Mr. Weigandt took out some trash and again observed the object. This time it appeared to be on the ground, with a dull reddish glow. They also noticed charred leaves on the ground in the area, which they felt were possibly dropped or carried to the spot by the object. 

The leaf sample contains no radioactive trace elements, indicating that the object was not the source of any radioactivity. The analysis suggests that the object exhibited remarkable maneuverability and color-changing capabilities, which are consistent with characteristics often associated with unidentified aerial phenomena.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK SUMMARY REPORT

Hughes, a about witch appears on the left of complainants (not in chronological order) from Wednesday night, and which should be checked as possibly indicate respects. Complainant desires to know whac further reports, if any. Saturday the caller called before making this report was received 4:00 pm. Mrs. Donna Polkis, in response to my request for any additional information. Lansing, Michigan. She stated that she had observed that a "large brown mass" appeared quise willine to cooperate, and individuals seem to show a healthy mixture of interest and skepticism. My impression is that a more detailed reading of the logs and reports with examination of photographs (or physical evidence if any) will eliminate the bulk of reports concerned with noises only, but that other events appear to have occurred which require more detailed investigation and probably will call for several different types of inquiries. Agencies and individuals appearing to take a like interest in these reports, this is a very abbreviated list, and is given only for the purpose of aiding identification of the proper log pages or proper individuals with whom to communicate.

FLYING SAUCER PUZZLE GROWS
It May Be Helicopter - Or It May Not: Grand Ledge Report Strains Objects
Residents of Grand Ledge, who was visited One-Time Strange by the Grand Ledge Unidentified Flying Objects, which they saw some two or three years ago, were awakened at 9:30 p.m. Wednesday by the renewal of aerial excitement. 
Five persons, all of whom live on the outskirts of Grand Ledge, were watching a large "thing" in the sky. To some it was a helicopter-to others, possibly several objects. 
This was the story, as told by William Criswell, of 1339 East Clinton Street, Grand Ledge, to The State Journal.
"I have several other neighbors", he said, "who saw the same thing I did. We were all out in the yard, looking up at this thing in the sky."
According to Criswell, the "thing" first appeared about 9:30 p.m. It remained in the sky for around 15 or 20 minutes. When it disappeared, someone said a smaller object seemed to drop down from it. 
"I could see definite lights on it, and it seemed to be rotating", Criswell said. "I've done a lot of flying, and it didn't look like a plane or helicopter to me."
One woman, living on Webster Street, saw an "oblong object with a coloration like that of a helicopter" rising and moving from the direction of Prospect and Clifford Streets. She said the object then headed in the direction of Waverly Road.
"It's hard for me to believe it was a helicopter", she said, "but I don't know what else it could be. SOMETHING was up there, that's for sure."

Odd Sound Linked to Sky Object
BY DICK FRASER
The story went like this:
Mrs. Elizabeth Kolodgy, a living room couch, was awakened by a strange noise Thursday morn-the and she had an unaccountable feeling that something had passed over her house.
Looking out, she saw a glowing object in the sky, silvery, round and disk-like. It seemed to be hovering there, about 600 to 800 feet off the ground. The object, she said, had made a sound akin to the hum of a buzzing bee, but louder.
It was on the city's south side, drifting in the area near few minutes northeast minutes of a Lansing suburban area. And afterward, she said, the humming noise suddenly ceased.
Mrs. Kolodgy's husband, Richard, had heard the noise too, from the upstairs bedroom. He tried to reach the object with a flashlight, but it was gone by the time he got to a window.
Their daughter, Wanda, 10, also was awakened by the noise and saw the object, her mother said.
It was terrible, and it lasted for a mile or so," Mrs. Kolodgy Mrs. said of the strange object and its sound.
Police investigating a similar report from a resident in a suburban area the same morning found nothing unusual.
Callers at the Lansing State Journal told of other odd sounds reported in the city and area during the night.
One, who had just gotten home from work about 4 a.m., said he heard a high-pitched whine in the sky that lasted for about 10 or 15 seconds and then faded out.
Another woman from near Mason said she heard a strange noise that sounded like the hum of a generator or some kind of machinery at about 1:30 a.m.
But one elephant couldn't find the sound. A half dozen persons in at Lansing campus at Eastern Michigan University last Thursday from at least half a the area said they had heard nothing unusual.
Capt. Donald L. Cole of the Ingham County Sheriff's Department said that when he was notified of the sighting, he searched the area thoroughly but found no trace of any unusual object or sound.
"I think it was probably something natural that had a rather odd sound to it," he said, "but we have no explanation for it."
The Air Force's Project Blue Book, which investigates UFO reports, wasn't notified. But it was reported that some citizens believed the object might have been from outer space.

Whining Object in Sky Mystifies Lansing Area

LANSING - An unidentified flying object buzzing a suburban area near the East Lansing General Motors plant Wednesday night has the Lansing police puzzled.

The object, described as "a great, howling cone, spinning and a light-colored, shiny, metallic thing," was spotted by several observers, including a television newsman who saw it hovering for a while over the Lansing plant.

Stanley Rager, 60, and his wife, Blanche, were on their way home from the Lansing restaurant he owns.

"They first saw the object," Rager said, "as we were driving east on Interstate 496 near the General Motors Fisher Body plant. It looked like a great, huge bowl, spinning very rapidly, and it was sending out a whirring noise that sounded very high-pitched."

Elmer Spear, of 1008 W. Dunlap, Lansing, said, "I don't know sounds carried that far." He said the sound was a "whirling noise that started low and got so loud and high-pitched it seared me."

Army Capt. Donald Kearney, a graduate student at Michigan State University, said, "I thought it was a helicopter (or) tanks on Cedar St. But it was like nothing I've ever seen before."

One unidentified woman said she saw the UFO is then take off again."

Whining Object in Sky Mystifies Lansing
LANSING - An unidentified flying object" traversed across Lansing early Thursday, setting nerves on edge and giving residents a spectacular show.
Don Weissett, 30, a television announcer in Jackson, first saw the object "while driving to Kalamazoo." He described it as "a great, silver-metallic thing."
Witnesses report to Lansing police that they saw the object and heard it "whining" and "screeching" as it moved across the sky. Many of the sightings were in an area near the Lansing Flying Club at the Lansing Capital City Airport.

Elmer Eder, of 1008 W. Dunlap, Lansing, said, "I know it sounds crazy (but) I'd never seen the thing before in my place."
The object, Eder said, "It was pretty hot, too - a great, bright silver thing. All of a sudden, it disappeared, there was nothing."
State Police Sgt. Bert Hicks, of the Lansing post, said his wife, Barbara, "saw the object and said the way it came from the Lansing restaurant is gone."
The speed was terrific. Faster and faster it went until it disappeared in the east," the sergeant's wife said.

Was it Martians?

Odd saucer-shaped object sighted by Michigan area

By DICK ST. CLAIR  

Some folks are the subject of attention of more bizarre incidents than others. For instance, there's Mrs. Donna Couvillion, a lady whose living room window afforded her a front-row seat on what she believes was a "flying saucer" episode that had 'em all shaking their heads in amazement.

Others reported hearing the sound of the object as it sped silently on its way for a few minutes about 1 a.m. Sunday.

Mrs. Couvillion said the object struck her as "different" and that it seemed to have a definite shape, almost like a saucer, as it hovered over a field behind her home for several minutes.

"It was over the tree top and then it seemed to dart off at a terrific speed," said Mrs. Couvillion. "It was one of the strangest things I've ever seen."

The object, she said, gave off a bright light which illuminated the entire neighborhood as it passed overhead. She said she could see it quite clearly for about four or five minutes before it disappeared.

Other neighbors also saw the object and one family reported running outside to watch it. One man said it looked "like a big old balloon."

Some said they heard a "whooshing" sound as the object zipped by. Mrs. Couvillion said she was in her living room when she caught sight of the strange craft.

The story, of course, has to be taken with a grain of salt, since flying saucer stories are as common as the weather these days. But there are occasional reports that seem to have more substance.

And this one has the backing of an impressive number of witnesses.

Said one resident: "I was too scared to get a good look at it. I just stood there with my mouth open."

NO ELEPHANT

The expert opinion couldn't be summoned on this one - the Air Force Project Blue Book chief, Major Hector Quintanilla, admitted he couldn't make "heads or tails" of it.

"It doesn't seem to fit any of our patterns," he said. "Neither the husband nor wife got a good look at it, and their descriptions differ."

He said Donald R. Keyhoe, director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, has a "far-fetched theory" that the object may have been an "unmanned space probe" from outer space, possibly on its way to the moon.

"If this is true," said Keyhoe, "then these Michigan sightings could be our first authentic contact with some kind of alien intelligence."

But Quintanilla, who has been studying flying saucer reports for years, said he just couldn't go along with that. "There's no concrete evidence to support it," he said.

So the case remains a mystery. All that's certain is that a number of people in the Lansing, Mich., area saw something they couldn't figure out.

And now it's up to the experts to try to unravel the riddle.

27 May 1964

May 27th, a flying saucer was seen hovering over downtown Lansing, Michigan, just before 4:00 a.m. according to five witnesses. One of the witnesses, a local businessman, called the police. Two police officers also witnessed the object hovering above treetop level. He said that the object turned on its side and appeared to be the size of a small automobile. It was soundless and left no vapor trails. Many other persons were reported to have seen the object during the early morning hours, and an Air Force investigator was eventually sent to get firsthand information about the sighting.

The Lansing, Michigan Area

On 8 May 1964 at approximately 9:00 p.m., EDT, the witness was driving west on US-127, approximately 7 miles south of Lansing, Michigan. The witness observed an object in the sky to the north. The object was described as round or oval in shape and appeared to be glowing with a yellowish-white light. The object was moving slowly and silently. The witness observed the object for approximately 5-10 minutes before it disappeared from view to the northeast.

The witness was an adult male. No other witnesses were reported. The weather at the time was clear with few clouds and the visibility was good. No photographs of the object were obtained.

This sighting was investigated and evaluated by the United States Air Force under Project Blue Book. The sighting was determined to be "Unidentified".

LANSING, MICHIGAN AREA
M_Y 8, 1964
On May 8, 1964, at approximately 9:20 p.m., EST, citizen X reported to the Michigan State Police Post in Lansing that he had observed a strange aerial object over the Lansing area. Citizen X stated that the object was circular in shape, with a diameter of approximately 50-60 feet. The object was hovering at an altitude of approximately 1,500 feet and was observed for approximately 5-7 minutes before disappearing from view. Citizen X described the object as metallic in appearance and emitting a bright white light. No sound was heard during the observation.
The object was reported to be located over the northwest section of the city of Lansing, approximately 5 miles from the downtown area. Weather conditions at the time were clear with a few scattered clouds and light winds from the southwest.
The Michigan State Police contacted the local Air Force BLUE BOOK representative at Kellogg Air Force Base in Battle Creek, Michigan, and reported the incident. An investigation was initiated, but no further information is available at this time.

Preliminary Investigation of UFO Reports, May 17 - 22, 1964.

On Friday night, May 22-23, I made a brief telephone survey in response to a request by J. A. Hynek, Director of Dearborn Observatory, following his appraisal of UFO reports of sightings in Lansing, Michigan.

My first call was to UPT in Chicago; a report of a UFO sighting had come in, but from Marion, Indiana. A subsequent call to UPT in Lansing established that reports were considered independently, both local and distant.

I contacted the Police Department in San Marion, and was informed that police officers in the Marion force and in police departments of surrounding towns ( as far as Muncie, Indiana ) had been observing strange lights in the sky during the past three nights, both stationary and moving, which struck witnesses as unusual enough to report. Calls to several of the other departments in the area did not add much information, as the witnesses were on patrol or were not on duty at the time. I was assured that the witnesses would be available if a complete investigation were carried out; in most cases the sightings were logged, or else the force is small enough that the individuals involved will be easy to find.

I did succeed in locating one witness who saw an orange light low in the northwest sky, apparently 1,200 to 500 feet high, three to six miles away, having driven to the west and of town ( Hartford City ) after hearing over his police car radio comments about other sightings in progress. The officer, Robert Merrilch, reports that the Blackford County Sheriff's Department also received many reports, and another man named Andy whom they questioned, claims to have seen the orange light. It seems clear that the object was Venus, just prior to setting.

The other reports may involve more definite motion, and some involve multiple objects (at least one observation through binoculars), so the Venus explanation cannot readily be extended without further information.

Having established that enough information could be obtained through the Lansing police departments for a future investigation, I turned to the Lansing reports.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing text describing a sighting report from David N. Moody in Lansing, Michigan. I will now proceed to extract all the text from the document:

THE REPORT OF TEST DAVID N MOODY, TO LANSING, MICHIGAN

On 1 Jun 64, Test David N Moody, AF 1925-937, departed Wight-Patterson AFB, Ohio for the Lansing, Michigan area to investigate reports received by the news media and letters from public citizens requesting information. 

On 13 June, Test Moody met William Paxson of Northwestern University in Lansing, Michigan who stated that he had received several phone calls from citizens in the Lansing area reporting sightings from 21 and 22 May 64. Sgt Snyder of the Lansing Police Department was also present during these discussions.

Sgt Moody accompanied by Bill Powers proceeded to the Lansing City Police Station where they discussed the police log and reports on file. These reports and discussions with officers on duty indicated various sightings were known, details of which could not be determined.

In the City Police station, investigators proceeded to the office of Police Inspector Frank Rand regarding the sightings in the Lansing area. Discussions were also held with the Inspector's secretary and other police personnel. It was determined that numerous sightings and a determination was made as to which specific cases reports were received from. 

Sgt Moody's instructions to the airman were to group all sightings with additional information into: 

(1) Sightings attributable to the known sources (special lights on a police car, etc.)
(2) Sightings for which additional information was required.

This was believed to be a proper procedure in order that those sightings which contained the most information could be followed up first.

Sgt Thornton of the East Lansing, Michigan Police Department made a possible meteor observation. A probable meteor shower was covered in Bill Powers' report.

This information was investigated later by both Sgt Moody and Bill Powers (to be contacted by telephone).

35 state university students or two college students (to be contacted by Bill Powers) at Michigan State University reported sightings to the police.

- page 58 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report detailing a series of UFO sightings in the Lansing, Michigan area on May 20, 1964.

The text in the document is as follows:

The first Lansing call was to the Lansing Police Department, where I spoke with Sgt. Snyder. A series of calls had been received from residents of Southern Lansing for several days, starting on Wednesday, May 20. A list of names was obtained from the log of Wednesday, all from people who complained of a "weird noise." This noise was described as approximately as loud as swimming, and making a "humming" noise, starting low and going higher. In a subsequent call to the Ingham County Sheriff's office, I was informed that at 3:30 Wednesday morning a police car had made an emergency run down Miller Street, employing a new "whining" siren, which the deputy described as sounding "loud."

When I read him the list of addresses of the complainants, he identified most, but not all, of them as being close to the route of the emergency run. 

It was also found that an object was sighted all night in a shopping center nearby, part of a promotion stunt.

The reports of 3 AM Wednesday, therefore, may tentatively be connected with the emergency run, as I understand it is true in all cases.

Reports from Thursday and Friday night, however, cannot be connected with the siren, as objects were seen. These objects seem to have appeared independent sightings of different objects.

One object, a bright blue or blue-green light, was seen descending (that is, going out of sight following a course) by two people. 

When the two sighters saw the light, they were in their own cars on the way home. Both were impressed sufficiently to attempt to drive to the object, disappearing, and both describe it as "tumbling," it might be an aircraft in trouble. The man met subsequently, who said he had been acting in his capacity of television announcer (for WJIM) at a remote broadcast from a restaurant () in Lansing and how they saw this object. Unfortunately, it appears that they have already compared their stories, as both reported to me in phone calls Wednesday morning that the object had tumbled and disappeared.

- page 59 -

There is no photograph present in the image provided. It appears to be a scanned document containing text about a UFO sighting.

the sighting took place at "12:10 to 12:15". Both men have agreed to cooperate in any detailed investigation.
One of the calls associated with the night of the emergency run previously mentioned was from a farmer in Grand Ledge, who called the fire department with a report that he had seen a flying object land and take off again.
A police car 9 miles from the scene was dispatched, but before it arrived the farmer, whose name was not obtained, said that the object was gone; the investigating patrol reported sighting nothing unusual, so the sighting was not logged in the police report.
The farmer said the object was difficult to describe. The police officer clearly believes the man to be "mistaken".
There are several more reports which need to be straightened out better than I could do over the telephone. One involving two men coming home from the night shift (apparently) at Oldsmobile, one of the men was pulled over by a police car and saw an object that he felt was not a shooting star going behind the house.
At _________, the wife jumped out of bed, terrified, the sound having awakened her. Between these calls to the sheriff's office and Michigan State Police were received, and I received an unsolicited call from a reporter, Dick Frasier of the Lansing State Journal, who was trying to find out if my calls of the night before were legitimate, and who had another report which came in just after I had made contact with _________.
A Miss _________, in Lansing, saw three objects as 9:00, 9:45, and 11:00 PM on the 20th, at least one of which showed shape (outlines), not point source) and which she observed through binoculars. Her husband also saw the objects and shared what he observed.

- page 60 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page of text from a Project Blue Book report.

Text from the document:

"Hughes"", a street which appears on the list of complainants ( not in chronological order) from Wedneday night, and which should be checked as possibly being a different report from the "Hughes" reports.

Saturday afternoon the final call before making this report was received from Sgt Gage, of the Michigan State Police, in response to my request for any additional information that might arise. He reported that the object I had just reported was a very strange "whirring" sound from her back yard, at 9:00 or 9:15 PM. She saw nothing, but found a burned area in her yard. This about 10 feet by 4 or 5 feet in dimensions. Leaves were lying on the ground were charred, but the grass underneath was not. She has saved samples of the leaves, and is willing to be interviewed. She, too, delayed her report for fear of ridicule, until other reports were published. Her husband may have heard the noise, but has not seen the area.

This brief report actually covers the information that were received and logged at the police departments in the area. All police agencies appear quite willing to cooperate, and individuals seem to show a healthy mixture of interest and skepticism. My impression is that a more detailed reading of the logs will together with examination of records of ground movements at critical period yield more precise information and probably will eliminate the bulk of reports concerned with noises only, but that other events appear to have occurred which require more detailed investigation and probably further direct contacts with witnesses.

There follows a list of persons some of the /Persons who made reports; this is a very abbreviated list, and is given only for the purpose of aiding identification of the proper individuals for personal interviews with whom to communicate.

Captain Hector Quintanilla

Washington, D.C. 20330

Dear Captain Quintanilla:

Enclosed is a field report very interesting. I am sorry but it is not cover a single UFO sighting. It covers more of an observation of a general nature- related to sightings of objects reported in this area over a number of years. This is a rather unique observation and may be of value in understanding the psychology behind sightings and our attempts to collect reliable data.

On 6 occasions over the last 6 years I am enclosing a list of sightings and data. Dr. Frank Horak, director of the observatory, has analyzed this data and made the following observations:

1. Most of the early plans are gills and even relatively some modern cases (July 11, 1957, for example) are in no way typical of what a normal observer would say, but are very much like the old woodcuts and artist's conceptions of what a UFO ought to look like.

I would like to add that working with nave people was a pleasure.

Sincerely yours,

WILLIAM T. POWERS
Assistant Director

THE DALE NEWS
DALE, INDIANA
FRIDAY, MAY 15, 1964 

This document appears to contain a detailed written report regarding a UFO investigation. The text describes various aspects of the investigation, including references to a "State Trooper Frank J. Cook", "Tresham", and a discussion about not revealing details to the public. The tone and content suggest this is a serious, official document related to the investigation of a reported UFO sighting or incident.

Report of UFO Activity, May-June, 1954
Dearborn, Michigan
DETAILS:
On June 11-14, 1954, this correspondent and R. E. David Mood, USAF, visited Lansing, Michigan, to investigate various reports of UFO activity and USAF-related phenomena which were received by local and state police during the period starting on the night of 20 May, 1954 and ending 15 June, the last night of the investigation.

The Sites: At 0300 EST, 21 May 1954, the Lansing police department began to receive a series of calls concerning the sighting of various objects, which were designated as "weird" and "loud," and indicated that it was like nothing they had ever heard before. The calmes are linked in the police log as coming to the realization which was found, and according to the correspondence files, they are omitted (more than a dozen names are recorded, and police say that after this many had called, they stopped logging further calls, as police were not equipped to handle such a volume).

The Ingham County Sheriff's Police department reports that at 0300 on the date of the reports, a police car was on an emergency run along Miller Road (5-W) and observed a fiery red object approximately the size of a large automobile going and departing rapidly. This new area employs a very loud time voice and falls both in pitch and intensity at a rapid rate - two to three times per second. The resulting pattern is quite uncertain and appears to consist of such things as child, and the conviction on the part of the callers that something remarkable was occurring. One woman, a ... reported a ship-shaped "traveling at incredible speed" over trees, which was illuminated and appeared to have a gray metallic surface.

Text Extracted from the Document:

As to where around 12 o'clock it appeared over the trees (and probably passed on a line back, as the temperature was in the low thirties) resulting in low ceiling, a condition conducive to an inversion layer. A UFO sighting consisting of a single white light in the northeast at an altitude of about 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon.

The locations from which the calls came were all close to the route of the vehicle that was in this investigator's opinion, will be around 0300 on 22 May way be attributed to the police-run.

Witness. The witness in this case is a fifteen-year old girl residing in Lansing, Michigan. She is not skilled in description of objects. The details of her sighting are very vague and consist of unimportant insignia that she and being unable to draw even a single sketch.

Her basic story is that as she was looking her bicycle home at about 9:30 pm, she heard a loud roaring sound which a steady tone in it, and looked up to see a rectangular object, resting glow in color, silently hovering about 250 to 300 feet in the air. She noticed about seven or eight bright (bright light) from her home), and heard a loud roaring sound with a steady tone in it, and looked up to see a rectangular object, glowing in color, silently hovering about 250 to 300 feet in the air. She noticed about seven or eight bright (bright light) from her home), indicating this same object, and seemed to be a part of this object. The light was estimated to be as bright as the inside light of an automobile. The light was said to be surrounded by an intense light-source having a diameter as large as the bottom of the rectangular object. The light then went out with a sudden and the object went out of her sight. All the surrounding investigates (described as "it") went out at once like turning off light switches. The light was bright enough to light up the trees but could not make out any definite shapes. This light was visible for a period estimated to be 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. The object, although there was no wind. The light was flashing at times, but observed to be steady for the most part. When a gust of heavy smoke came toward her, she thought that it might be caused by the object, but did not think any more of it. This smoke, however, cleared rapidly, and had a burning odor, which was somewhat pungent.

There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in the provided document. The text describes a written report from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969.

The text:
This witness states that she was frightened and ran to the window. She found that "water-birds" all the cows seemed to be.

The strange object that she observed was estimated to be at least half a mile (unless there is a closer view than the one the investigator.s found), and thus much larger than the one the investigator.s found), and thus much larger than the "flying saucer" reported earlier on this date.

The shape of the object was determined roughly by showing the girl three rectangles, one square, one with a length-to-width ratio of about 3 to 2, and one with a ratio of about 2 to 1. She picked the middlc one, adding that the comers were "rounded slightly".

The object appeared about half or each side cut off, about 4 inches, and about an eighth the picked the dash-dot-dot picture. She indicated that it was not like the "flying saucer" picture labelled "Figure A", which some authorities object to show as an example of what is meant.

The text in the document is as follows:

"Lansing, Michigan, and 'what's it, but there was a lining, a dome, on top?' This apparently occurred as described, not from the vantage point where the observers were, but could have been something on their side.

The investigators found the two witnesses described running at 90° to the directions described later during the interview, and in correspondence to the original description, stated clearly in this interview, that the object was stationary on the east-west course; the object would then have appeared from the south, and disappeared ahead of them, that is, to the north.

All the witnesses were students at Michigan State University, where they had returned from the scene. They were returning to their residences after a speech on campus."

Based on the text in the document, the output is as follows:

Blue light. It was brilliant or metallic color, and was surrounded by a haze.

According to the object appeared stationary, at first toward the south, all this time, and then emitted a brilliant white glare, like a magnesium flare.

For it could not see it.

According to the observer who looked later and just saw a brief glimpse, the light did flash on briefly, revealing a circular shape, and then the object traveled at high speed from the west toward the earth, finally disappearing behind trees in the west-southwest. The whole movement took about 2.5 seconds.

The object showed no features, but had a definite (elliptical) shape. It was silent.

The sighting was very brief, lasting a couple of seconds. Little can be learned from the description that provides identification. Photo mission, the discs being a "satellite radar disc". This is a weak explanation, however, unless the haze can be accounted for. If the hazy object is a vehicle, they may simply have failed to identify the moving object after the initial flash.

then no explanation in conventional terms can be offered. There is no basis for a choice between the reports.

One SAF personnel at Lansing, Michigan, and Jackson, Michigan, telephoned to report object as described above that was driving extremely fast, apparently at high altitude at around 12 May. Such call gave a brilliant blue light to the horizon, traveling airless than 1/2 mile, appeared and disappeared. Then said that the object lasted perhaps 1/2 to 1 1/2 miles away.

Transcribed text:

On Friday evening, 8 May 1964, at about 2250 hrs in the Lansing, Michigan area, the witnesses observed an "airborne object" in the distance. The object was moving toward the place where the witness was, and initially looked larger as it approached. The object was described as having a "brilliant" light that "was the brightest thing I've ever seen." It was estimated to be at an approximate distance of 500 feet.

As the object neared the place where the witness was, it suddenly stopped and hovered. The object then moved swiftly and silently away, traveling straight down a path bearing approximately 030 degrees from Lansing. The witness stated that this sighting was of a "typical unidentified object" and that the object was remaining at approximately a constant distance (and hence, presumably, a constant size) or that the object was moving rapidly away and becoming smaller.

It is concluded that this sighting was of a typical unidentified object, with a slight possibility that it was a natural object (e.g., a star) that was seen descending to the horizon. The fact that the object's horizon indicates the possibility that it was a star moving along a path bearing approximately 030 degrees from Lansing.

Michigans or Grates Road) were awakened by a humming noise appearing to come from a source, both were in the house at the time, got dressed, and went out to the driveway where they noticed the source of the noise on the ground approximately ten feet from the house.

And say they observed an object approximately a 10-degree elevation angle, perhaps as low as 3 degrees. By several experimented approaches, the object size appeared size of the full moon on clear nights, but seemed substantially closer and smaller than the moon, which is not in view or easily be seen in the sky at the time of the observation, which was shortly after 4:00 a.m. on the morning of the 8th.

And say they did not see the object on this side (cannot were sound) but they heard the noise to inside, this house nearly dimmed according to the investigator was a slowly pulsating the hole of a detail, what the investigator later understood meant the noise made by the force of a pulsed electric current when one is following close a pulsed magnetic field.

When the sound of a pulsed object which and the investigators generally in the top-secret data, which was never perfectly, was of a loud background of noise which this already quite experienced. The noise was described as very loud.

The object appeared to be suspended rather than just hovering and seemed to be glowing with a hazy glow, perhaps a little fore more intense than that from the bedroom window, and said that the object apparently passed by at about that distance. He estimated the speed at perhaps thirty feet per second, rather close to the ground, going across the fence to the woods. One on each side of the window, but not directly in front of it. The time of the incident would be approximately 1-2 seconds. Immediately after the object had moved, the noise was gone, and it was quiet again.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"Helicopters both day and night in the area; poor witnesses are quite familiar with the appearance and sound of helicopters under day and night conditions, and cannot reasonably be thought to have made the suggested mistake.  

Helicopters were flown in that area on the same night, but caused operations for several hours before the sighting.

As a result of the shifting size of the object can be explained from knowledge of the observing power of the observers. According to the statement, the object was first beyond the trees on the second pass and had six equal-spaced lights. According to the observers obtained (from a later statement), this is indicative of a triangular ship. The initial distance to the object corresponds to about 2/3 of the radius of the presumed circular object. The twin-adapted normal eyes can resolve two points measures about 3 minutes of arc. Just beyond the trees 600 feet to the west, and if the red lights were just separated, then the diameter of the object would have been only 1.8 feet - that is, the report was that the small as well as 1.8 feet in diameter and 600 feet away. Clearly, it was not that small, for the lights were not just "resolved" but were seen as definitely separated by (eliminating the picture) some 3 to 4 times the diameter. If not more (this drawing may be intended to show the shape as well as placement of the lights). The object was, indeed, have been 50 feet in diameter, or slightly more. Its second appearance is difficult to describe because the apparent size increase is so evident. At the second pass, when both witnesses saw it for a period "more than five" of the first pass, the reading of the object was 3 minutes of arc. This indicates an object of about 100 feet in diameter at the distance indicated.

The distance was taken to be about 600 feet. The reading on the second pass, when both witnesses saw it for a period "more than five" of the first pass, the reading of the object was 3 minutes of arc. This indicates an object of about 100 feet in diameter at the distance indicated."

The sound occurred after she had heard a siren going down the street. The sound lasted less than 5 minutes. She had the impression that it disappeared as quickly as it came. When she looked outside, she saw nothing. She informed the official of this event, and he seemed certain that she could not have been mistaken. The sound sounded more like a sonic boom than any other noise she had heard. The authorities tried to locate the source of the sound, but could not find anything. The text mentions that the witness's name is blocked out.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

"As page 2 shows, a call was received from a [REDACTED] Lansing, residence (State Police headquarters), reporting a sighting of what appears to be the same object that [REDACTED] saw.

He was emphatic about the fact that he had never seen such a strange object in all his life. He was reluctant to talk about it, expressing some regret that he 'had ever "opened his mouth" about it. The investigator had a slight impression his excitement had perhaps not immediately subsided as it the object was so strange - his apparent agitation seemed out of proportion to the sighting of a bright meteor, but may, of course, have been due only to the fact that his experience was being investigated.

He and his wife were interviewed. These witnesses had been riding in an open convertible about three miles south-west of [REDACTED] location, at about the same time ([REDACTED]), and were on an interchange of [REDACTED] 36 at the Cedar Street entrance, headed south, a pre-medital student, just finishing his senior year, saw the object for the longest time his wife, alerted by his exclamation, just caught a glimpse of it before it winked out. He first noticed it. Its elevation was between 20 and 30 degrees. It was judged later to be as bright as Venus, perhaps brighter (Venus was approximately as resplendent 2-3 than the same color). It moved silently the same color as white lights the object moved to the north through an arc of about thirty degrees, lasting about three seconds. At the out of this time, the light suddenly got out, trailing a shower of sparks, disappearing in about 2 seconds.

OCR Text Output:
then for this object to travel thirty degrees in three seconds, it would have to have been about 25 miles away; even with an elevation of thirty degrees (an upper limit) it would have been only about 15 or 20 miles high. If this true size of the object was as above described, then no more than a proper altitude, the line of sight distance would have to be at least four or five times the horizontal distance just calculated, and the velocity would have to be of the order of thousands of feet per second.

The sudden cessation of light, with no trail left behind, no slowing down or any other indication that this object was of a similar physical nature, and no fading or glow, suggests either an extremely high velocity unseen, or the more interesting possibility of a meteor or larger size and very high velocity which "skipped" in and out of the atmosphere. Unfortunately, both the duration of 2 to 3 seconds and the apparent lack of any correlation of starting point is possible, and it could not remember very closely how far the object was before it winked out, except to say that the trajectory ended "at a considerable distance." We cannot be certain that the same duration of 2 to 3 seconds, within the limits of the estimates, with being the latter one. The lines of slight were parallel when the light went off less distance than a large distance. The same limits of distance were traveled with less time, however, at a speed of less than per second. In the atmosphere, any material object would be visible as a track and the light could not withdraw so abruptly.

The observer initially reported that the object returned from the west soon after the incident and was close to the road to look around. He determined on chocking the vehicle but it had already disappeared and was never seen again. This incident, of course, raises the usual questions concerning the nature of the object. Was it a meteor, an experimental aircraft, or something more uncommon?

reported during the personal interview. The similarity in brightness and color had misled them.

P-1 watch at the crater point had been on a line of flight passing through both craters, then no horizontal triangulation is possible. Elevation angles estimates are too uncertain to permit estimates.

This is a probability, the object may have been a fact, bright, meteor, a fireball, far to the south and may miles high. If so, it could have been seen in northern central Indiana, and would have been brightest advisors over the Indiana-Michigan border.

The object seen could not have been the same as the one reported by the anonymous caller to have been "over her house," because the day's haze was somewhere between a thin and thick veil, no definite identification is possible on this latter object.

7. _____________, 205 Broadway, Bay City, Michigan, called this investigator to report that he had seen a light at 0030 moving almost directly overhead, from west to east, taking approximately five minutes to cross the sky from horizon to horizon. The object, which made no noise, was half the brightness of Jupiter, and every now and then wavered in direction. This, he said, is the wavering being a practically universal optical illusion, people often imagine an object has a small oscillating motion on questioning, it turned out that he did not actually try to see the object through the telescope.

Witness, for a student at n.i.u. par city in about 300 miles northeast of Lansing: At 2300, 25 May 1964, ______________ Fire Chief of the Delta county Fire Department (located in Escanada, Michigan) was awakened by a loud rumbling noise, which sounded very close. He turned on the house lights and went outside to investigate. He saw a bright round object, larger than the full moon, hovering silently at about 250 feet altitude above his house. It was described as being surrounded by a bluish-white glow, with a distinct line of demarcation between the glow and the object itself. The object remained stationary for about a minute, then accelerated rapidly in a northerly direction and disappeared from sight in 5-10 seconds.

Stepped 2250. It's parts (sure a few seconds required) he appear was, could be 500 yards away hovering approximately a 3 feet over a road only a few feet from the ground) went south then west and seemed to shoot straight up, and disappeared from sight in a few seconds. He looked up, and saw a brilliant white light-source. It seemed to envelop a round or disc-shaped object in this brilliance. The light upon this object was illuminating a circle on the ground beneath across the hi-way into the fields. Both a reddish color softened the edges (and apparently illuminated) of the entire circumference of the object being lighted. He is certain that this was nothing other than what he looked up and saw at the light. He took this to be sight-mindedness; the light burned out almost immediately. Shortly after the light went out, the sound came as a somewhat roaring sound. All during the experience, the noise kept up a steady roar, and after the light went out, the sound seemed to move straight up and then off to the east, towards Lansing. Just about straight down the highway. The object had difficult disappearing, the noise similar to a jet engine,  so low he had never heard anything like it before; it definitely could not have been an aircraft sound. Yet a helicopter. The light was on for three or four minutes. He discusses the incident and several other later incidents are described in detail, and from your analysis that it were the "strange object" back. He did not feel any heat. Practically every word for a loud noise was tried out, and was still not quite satisfying to the investigator, who evidently came across a similar case (see sightings) made a note at about 6 above middle. I don't believe I can produce much with a "word" is to be with the sensational. It's concluded and I can't. "You wouldn't believe it, how close is that to what I heard?" He remained several times that he was not surprised he was that the object found would have been so closely followed by a second such incident in the same area.

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, but it does not contain any photographs. The text in the document is as follows:

"At about 0300, 1 June, 1954, Miss _____ and her 10-year-old sister, _____, were studying Martian in the cottage living room when they heard a loud roaring sound. She looked out the front window which was on the east side of the cottage and saw a bright flash of light and a humming sound. The noise gradually ceased, and, after a moment, a bright light reappeared and seemed to shoot back to the cottage. About ten minutes later, she again heard the sound, this time it came from the east, apparently. The noise gradually became louder and louder, sounding like 'motor and lawnmower' and lasted for several seconds, and faded to silence. Mrs. ___ who is a very light sleeper, being unusually, the younger girl dashed into bed with her mother and took no further part in the observations.
The next sound (noise?) part of the object was observed like up brightly as well as the yards bordering it on each side. The noise was now extremely loud, and when she opened the window to look out, it became so loud that she had to cover her ears. Her sister became hysterical and began to water over her head, going north toward the lake. Its lower side was so bright that after five to ten seconds, it began to fade to water. The object went across the lake. She lifted up from where she was and began to water. The object went across the lake. It was difficult to make out any details about the object because its 'circular' motion and its
'impotation of some light projectile on top, possibly
semi-circular', and 'of another projection on the bottom around the light, possibly spherical'. The object seemed to be so more diameter than diameter of the island at the point where it passed over it. It was difficult to make out any details about the shape of the object because its 'circular' motion and its 'rotation' seemed to prevent closeups or "sharp" as it were, but seemed to keep the same face forward. The noise
went off, but only faded out."

Text output from the document:

"I had been several years in the Air Force, and know about project Blue Book. The morning after the sighting (actually the next day) I called the Public Information Officer who was in the Tactical Command. He told me that this note picked up was D approx Middle C, which was the note later used by the investigator during the interview (as he reported that had been a week before).  

There was a reddish haze, but the object reflected considerably less light. You could not find it again. One time.  

I said that he had tried to estimate the size of the object from the character or reflection of the highlights, and came out with a diameter of roughly forty feet. From the time the noise began, the second time until the time that the light disappeared behind trees low in the western horizon, the duration was estimated at about twelve to fifteen seconds - perhaps five or ten seconds before the light appeared in the yard. The velocity was estimated as "not fast." Immediately after the lighting completely disappeared, it appeared in the trees, motionless, for several seconds - perhaps five to ten before the light disappeared in the trees. She was extremely frightened. She went outside, since she could not awaken her mother, to see if any other lights were on. Or is anyone else had come out to see what was happening, but found no one. All the cottages were dark. In fact, nearby one else had already returned home after the weekend, and most of the cottages were deserted.

This investigation was conducted entirely by telephone, unfortunately when the investigator went to Lansing, he could not be reached by telephone, and they were probably gone for the weekend.

He also said he would contact a local newspaper which he later may (have) indicated or the papers no or the area, bo see if we any interested or if any other people who might have seen the call to his attention.

It is regretted that this case could not be more completely investigated, already pretty, however, apparently did not wish be to identified."

As per the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) request, the text found in the document is as follows:

considerable credence to this report. Further evaluation is delayed to the end of this report.

On 13 June, 1954, at about 2:15 A.M., two fifteen year old girls, Grand Rapids, Michigan, and two their younger sisters, Grand Rapids, both sixteen years old, were at a party on Sycamore Road about fifteen miles from Grand Rapids. After leaving the party, and Miss ______ was driving, with Miss ______ beside her, in the front seat. The car had just pulled out of the driveway and was about to head toward Grand Rapids when both girls saw something which they thought at first was a star.

The light came closer, and it was apparent that it was not a star, but a large glowing shape which filled the road from side to side. Miss ______ stopped the car, and they watched the object for a few seconds, glowing considerably, but smoothly, and then rose again to maximum brightness for several seconds. It then disappeared, without sound, to the east, as if it was climbing, as the girls were unable to follow it, according to the girls. They could not see the road through it, or cars passing by on Saginaw Road through the small opening that was visible. A visible glow remained, as well as a neon sign on a distant bowling alley.

Investigators visited the scene with the girls and Miss ______ parents. The girls showed the investigators where the car was stopped, and they indicated a spot on the ground where the object had been hovering. The girls, who were very frightened, had not looked closely at the object, and it was dark at the time, so the boys said they had not been able to make out any details.

The location on the driving course was found to be about 350 feet in about 250 to 300 degrees, depending on whether one was going by the place where the car was stopped or the spot indicated on the ground. The location was about a half-mile from the party site.

Toward duskier highway, or 623 feet away, plus the 30 feet the car moved before stopping.
Investigators found no traces of anything unusual on the road over a distance of about 0.2 mile. Where were some light impressions from tires, and some ruts were a car's tires had been and kicked up some local dirt that (the road material) was disturbed, but not beyond what their own car had done down the road.
The other investigators, Lt. Loomis, is not exactly the matter further, since just exactly the things observed which both sides or the road, or the metal, field. Standing water was noticed, near the spot where the object was supposed to have been, on the east side of the road. It was thought that some fog might have been caused to local conditions from this location.
The size of the object, drawn hereof the field trip to the location, corresponded very closely to the opening that can be seen between and under the bushes and fence like structure marking off the road. Anything that had landed on the road, such as a drifting cloud of fog, would, of course, take on the shape of the opening, flat on the bottom and a slightly flattened dome on top. It would seem, however, to correspond with headlight reflections on any fog that might appear, or at least determine if fog does arise shortly after dark.
The pilots basically saw a patch of fog drifting across the road; if that is the case, no other interpretation other than the description could be offered.
The pilots gave every indication of believing what they had observed, and it appears verified that they had stopped in a timely fashion.

Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed document with text describing a UFO sighting and related details, but no visual image is included.

Text from the document:

"92. CIVILIAN, sighted opening in clouds, around 8:40 p.m. 9 Apr. 64, making round ball about the size of a basketball, hovering overhead. Duration to be controlled by Capt. XXXXXX.

Subject: CIVILIAN sighting 3.45, 4.50 and 10 appear to be the same case, well ascertained. The witness appears to be a credible person, with a good reputation in the community. His sighting occurred about 8:40 p.m., 9 Apr 64, in the Lansing, Michigan, area. The object appeared to be a round ball, about the size of a basketball, hovering overhead. The duration of the sighting was not given, but it was stated to be "controlled" by Capt. XXXXXX.

This sighting is somewhat similar to the others in this report, with a small, round, hovering object being described. The sighting appears to have been of good quality, with a credible witness. However, without any further details or visual evidence, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the nature of the observed object."

17 Jun 64, summary of conversation between Frank Hand reporter, Landing, Michigan and Capt. o and Sgt. Moody.
What is happening in regards to Grand Lodge sightings?
Two sightings ! & 2
1. Was an interrupt
2. A reflection from fog.
1. Between two and three on the night of the sighting IFR flights in that area were diverted to Lansing towers. They were notified by Detroit. This was a classified radar project. Roger Snowberger was in tower at Lansing. Said he saw lots of plans. 'These were all low level flights.'
2. Very intuitive. Just a hypothesis, but reasonable, a swamp on one side, plowed field on other, weather everything matches up to be a reflection off of the fog.
Asked him to send us a copy of his article which he will do.
These sightings, are they pretty much par for the course. 'Yes, it is etc... Do these sightings run in cycles.' Yes, weather has been right for it, summer time. Quite a bit of activity intriques the peoples curiosity making more.
FYI the tower operators at Lansing get quite a few calls themselfs no they just go check and answer them at a time of call. Usually Venus, meteors, etc.
1. Flight over Grand Ledge was at 3 am Fri morning, 20 May 64. Equipment had turbine motor that made a whine noise which dropped out noise of a/c engines. Are we ever told, say New Mexico, more information of what really was? We have to know usually and no long as they say there was no something over that area little that description we leave it at that.

Subsequent to their observation they had received numerous telephone calls from residents in the area who had observed the same or a similar object. This included a child who observed the object and became somewhat upset, reportedly requesting parental assistance at the Grand Medical Center.

Mrs. A also stated that she had a child a few months old at the time of the occurrence and Mr. A indicated that this did not disturb the sleeping child. Also, Mrs. A is said to be of the opinion that the noise made by the object or objects was not enough to disturb the sleeping child.

Following the interview with Mr. and Mrs. A, Sgt Moody and Bill Grant proceeded to the Delta Township Fire Barn Station at Canal and Clinton, where they interviewed persons who were at the fire station during the early morning of March 20, 1964. An officer named Fitch stated that he was awakened by a high pitch shrill hum. He looked out the window and observed a bright light hovering about 30-40 feet above the trees. A bright light about 50 feet in diameter. The light went out and proceeded east following a short period during which the light pulsated intermittently. This object was observed by members of the fire department and in their opinion the light was sufficiently bright for him to see the ground across the road. From the station, the object was observed until it disappeared. It also reported that several people in the area had talked with him about having the noise and had complained about the noises causing their dogs.

Here is the text from the document:

To Saginaw Highway. As they turned onto the road from the driveway they noticed a light over the field towards them. However, they realized that it was not a car because there were no headlights approaching them. The light seemed to be hovering about 5 - 6 feet high and covered width of the road. It was about 15 - 20 feet long and seemed to have a hazy glow around it. The light disappeared and reappeared several times. When it reappeared it seemed to come closer and then disappear again. At this time the light disappeared completely. The incident lasted about 10-15 minutes. Sgt Moody and Mr Powers were accompanied to the scene shortly after they saw the light. They also saw the light but could not determine its source. It was dark and the area was heavily wooded. They could not find any tracks or evidence through which the road passed. Adjacent to this opening was a heavily wooded area and the light seemed to come out of the woods and move across the road, then disappear as it reached the other side. As they approached the area, the light seemed to move back into the wooded area. According to the distance where the car turned onto the road, it was estimated that the light was about 30 feet from the edge of the road. The light was said to be silent and to shine in a steady manner, not blinking. Sgt Moody said that he could not determine if this was the presence of ground fog from the pond.

EXTRACT FROM MR. MOODY'S TILE REPORT

Sgt Moody: The Crystal Lake sighting of __________ (to be investigated by Mr.)
1. Sgt Moody reports - It was requested by this witness that her name not be used.....
2. The Grand Ledge sighting by Mr. and Mrs. __________ (to be investigated by both Mr. Powers and Sgt Moody).
3. The observation from the police report of the Michigan State Police. It was decided due to Mr. __________ reputation as a publicity seeker that his sighting would be considered misinterpretation of a conventional object and/or insufficient evidence to indicate the object was an unconventional one.
4. The sighting of Mr. __________ (Case to be written on 6 May 64. Object evaluated as not unconventional).
5. The sighting by __________ (to be written up by Sgt Moody) as believed to be an astronomical body.
6. The Grand Ledge observation of __________ and __________ (to be investigated jointly by Sgt Moody and Bill Powers).
SIGHTINGS OF MISS ______
From the Lansing State Journal Office, Sgt Moody and Bill Powers proceeded to interview a young girl of 15. Her impressions of the object were vague, inconclusive and contained little information of a specific nature. The reported duration of the sighting was less than a minute when contacted and terminated. An investigation by the Genesee County Sheriff's officers indicated this case involved a hoax by a young girl who thought it would be exciting to report a UFO sighting.

SIGHTING OF MRS. ___________
Following the interrogation of ________, Sgt Moody proceeded to the home of Mrs. ___________, Lansing, Michigan. Arriving at 10:00, Sgt Moody obtained specimens of the leaves/needles that were collected from the yard inside the house on 20 May 64. Mrs. __________ stated that she had heard a vibrating sound causing a roaring in her ears.

EXTRACT FROM BLIE [sic] BOOK'S REPORT

3. Fighting. The witness in this case is a fifty-year-old girl student residing at in Lansing She is described to he very vague about the concept of apparent angular size and being unable to draw even a simple sketch of her experience.

Her basic story is that as she was riding her bicycle home at about 1800 hours on 21 May 1954, at the corner of Clifford and Prospect streets (about five miles from her home), she heard a loud roaring sound with a steamy, hissing noise overhead. After a few seconds (described as "five minutes" at first) she appeared to be a ball of flashing colored lights in the bottom of the object said later, regarding an intense light-source having a diameter as big as the object in its short dimension. The light was a pale red, and lit up the scene. At some time during this process. the lights around the tops of the trees around the intersection, and the thought the treetops were circled, were out. There was no wind. The light kept shining while the object remained, evidently the object moved away with a puff of heavy smoke, which dissipated slowly and disappeared. The light remained as the object left, and could be seen until it passed far enough for the object to disappear. As the object appeared, it faded away again as the object moved on.

- page 122 -

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document.

The text in the document is as follows:

The witness states that she was frightened and ran to the house, but found that house dark, all the other houses nearby were reported as dark also. She states that she abandoned her bicycle and ran all the way home, a distance of at least half a mile (unless the investigators found), and then went back later to get the bicycle. Since the witness could not estimate the size of the object ( the investigators estimated that it measured an arc of over 360 degrees in the sky), the investigators concentrated on trying to draw out a description of its appearance. The results of this further questioning must be tempered by the probability that she was adding to her story as time went on. During further questioning, the girl reiterated the sighting while the investigators timed her, roughly. According to this procedure, the noise took over 20 seconds to appear, the object hovered for about 6 seconds, and the departure occupied another 6 seconds until slight was lost, for a total of about twenty seconds. A second witness was present, whose statement describing the appearance took 14 seconds. Those times are probably a fair accurate estimate than the "five minutes" which the girl seemed to use to indicate any indefinite short time. The nature of the object was determined roughly by showing the girl three rectangles, one square, one with a length-to-width ratio of about 3 to 2, and one with a ratio about 5 to 1. She picked the middle one, adding that the corners were "like it." This description possibly indicates that the object was drawn, but the investigators then asked her how tall she thought each side cut off, about a sixth. She indicated that it was not flat as a shoe, but she had no way to describe how it appeared. The investigators then drew an outline "figure A" adding some additional witnesses and stating the object in perspective with rounded corners ( a guess that this was what she was trying to say): When this picture was shown, the witness, without waiting, stated that it was very much like the object.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

"Flight operations for the past week at Lansing, Michigan, indicated normal operations with no sightings of unusual aircraft that could be considered as unidentified flying objects (UFOs). No reports were made to the Lansing air traffic control tower of sightings of unusual objects flying over the Lansing area. Weather data was obtained for 13 June and used in the investigation.

The investigation with the air traffic control tower at Lansing revealed that many calls are received by the tower relating to aircraft. The investigation indicates that the observations by persons have been found to be one of the following in terms of a known aircraft, weather phenomena, or some other explainable source. The Lansing City Airport has an unobstructed view of the sky, and the reported activity of the control tower would indicate that any unusual aerial activity would likely be reported.

At 2300 on 15 June Sgt Moody returned to the motel.

On the morning of 15 June Sgt Moody proceeded from East Lansing, Michigan to East Lansing to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Sgt Moody has a driver's license, and attended the University of Michigan on that date. He was in East Lansing and Ann Arbor on official business. The information on these flights were located. Mr. Lee Evans was the person who had reported the sightings. He also was engaged in photo activity. Mr Lee Evans at this corporation was contacted by telephone and his qualifications and background were obtained. His company has such projects under current operations; one in Puerto Rico, one in Florida, and one in North Carolina on Project Space. This company also appears to contract for government agencies. It is indicated that Frank Lodge of Pontiac, Michigan, phone TE 2-2843, OX 7-3837, was engaged in taking 8 mm movies of such activities, and there are possible that Mr Lodge might have been flying infrared photo missions for some other individual."

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of a UFO-like object. The sketch depicts a saucer-shaped object with appendages or structures on the sides, and a light source at the bottom. The text in the image describes the details of the sighting and investigation, including the direction of motion, intersection location, and size of the object. There is no photograph in this image, only the hand-drawn sketch labeled "Fig A".

The text in the image is as follows:

Startled, said "that's it, but there was a thing, a dome, on top!" This apparently accounted for previous attempts to explain that she was looking up at the bottom, but could see something on top.

The investigators found the two streets described running at 90° to the directions described later during the interview, but in correspondence to the directions stated early in the investigation was contrary to the written report. Accordingly, the witness was standing on the southwest corner; the object would then have appeared from the south, and disappeared straight north. Four properties were seen, one on diagonally-opposite corners and two further down the block from Clifford, one north and one south. The intersection was relatively free of trees, giving the effect of a clearing perhaps 100 feet in diameter. All the streets were otherwise lined with mature trees.

EVALUATION is deferred to the end of this report.

FLYING SAUCER PUZZLE GROWS
It May Be Helicopter-or It May Not:
Four-in-City Report 'Strange Obiects'
In Lansing's continuing rash of strange aerial objects sighted, Police Com-
missioner Edward T. Masselink reported that another four persons had con-
tacted the police department and reported seeing similar UFOs. While these
latest incidents do not duplicate the earlier report of the police officer who
claimed to have seen a strange object hovering over his patrol car, they ap-
parently indicate that some residents of Lansing are observing unusual ob-
jects in the sky. 

John C. DeVos, a night manager at a local drug store, described the ob-
ject he saw as approximately 30 feet in diameter, round and giving off an in-
tense light. He said it was higher than a helicopter and was moving much
faster than a jet plane. Another observer, Mrs. Charles Klise, said she saw
something similar while driving home from work.

The report of the two other observers, still unidentified, stated they saw
an object that seemed to be cylindrical in shape and emitting a bright light.
They said they followed it for several minutes before it disappeared. 

The latest rumors indicate that the strange objects seen in Lansing's
sky may be more prosaic than flying saucers - perhaps they are advanced he-
licopters from a secret military installation. Some observers say the objects
resemble helicopters, flying very fast and high. Others insist they have seen
typical flying saucers.

Police and air force officials continue to investigate the reports, but
so far have been unable to identify the objects with certainty. There has been
no report of any physical evidence such as debris.

The text in the document is as follows:

EXTRACT FROM TELEPHONE REPORT

On 24 June at 0730 am, Sgt Moody met with Bill Povers at the Michigan State Police Headquarters in East Lansing, Michigan. We talked with Corporal Thornton of Michigan State Police regarding a report of a meteor (report of fighting to be covered in Bill Povers' report).

Appointment with Mr and Mrs _____ was arranged. They stopped for breakfast in Grand Ledge. 

1. Interview with Mr and Mrs _____
2. Interview with _____ and _____, residents

Grand Ledge on a farm, we contacted the Army Michigan National Guard. This organization has been requested to make reports on unusual sightings. They also have a group of individuals who have seen similar Unidentified Flying Objects that they do not fly night photo missions with. They have stated that their craft maneuvering capabilities are superior to ours and ours to the Presidents (sic). Persons in the area should be familiar with these craft. Information from the Director indicated that our Airport photo service at Capitol City Airport might have information regarding craft sightings in the area.

AT 0300 HOURS, 22 May 64th, Mr and Mrs _____ reported that an unusual object was observed from their upstairs bedroom window. This object was described as circular, 40-50 feet in diameter, red in color with four red lights flashing on and off and one white light steady and intermittent on its underside. This object was about 500-700 feet from their point of observation. Stars were out and no moon. No wings or other features were noticed on the object.

About ten minutes later the object reappeared according to the same witnesses. This time the object was slightly higher from the ground and moving from the observers. Again, the duration was short, less than one minute. The size and color characteristics of the first sighting were described. Time of the first sighting was estimated at 30 to 60 seconds. The second observation was described as sharp and pitched white, compared to the first sighting on a detailed track.

Subsequent to their observation they had received numerous telephone calls from residents of the area reporting similar objects. These included children who observed the objects, and persons, extremely loud, who had called the operator to report the objects and described the manner in which the object left the area. Extremely loud. They had received a call from a nurse at the Lansing City Hospital who had observed the object that same night. 

It should be noted that a child a few months old was the one that was awakened by the noise. The noise of the object did not disturb the sleeping child. All the children observed the object and described the manner in which the object left the area as like a silent telephone.

one of the calls associated with the night of the apparency was from a farmer in Grand Ledge, who called the officer mentioned asking that his having made an emergency landing the house next to the old one now occupied.
A report was 2 miles from the scene was dispatched, but before it arrived the farmhouse where none was not obtained, said that the object was going the investigating officer described nothing unusual to this object was not located. the farmer may be difficult to discover. The farmer said the object was flashing like a distant light. 15 feet in diameter. The farmer officer clearly believes the man to be "mistaken".

Between phone calls to (address) and (address) on Saturday morning, I received an unidentified call from a reporter, Dick Fracker of the Lansing State Journal, who was trying to find out if my castle was investigating, and who had another report which came in just after I had started my investigation Friday night. A man, (name) of (address), Lansing, saw three objects at 9:00, 9:15, and 9:30 which hovered and which were described through binoculars to be about the size of a basketball and they made no noise and they did disappear. Some neighbors who also saw them witness. The object was described so regularly defined with many little lights on its underside. It was felt that there could be a relaunch a secret project which the public as yet unknown.

Text from the document:

Sighting. Early Friday morning, 22 May 1964, at about 0:30 to 0:33, Mr. and Mrs. ****, Res. 1, Eagle, Michigan (7 miles north of Grand Ledge), Michigan, on ***** Caller Road) were awakened by a noise coming from the surrounding shrubbery around their house. Both were in bed in the northwest second-floor bedroom of their home. They went to the window and looked out across a field to the west of the house. They saw an object pass by at close range, apparently about 15 feet above the ground. It was oblong in shape, like an egg, and was glowing a dull orange-red color. It passed by at an elevation of about 3 degrees. By several experimental approaches, the apparent size of the object was estimated at about three times that of the full moon, which was visible in the case of the full moon being exaggerated to about 6 inches at arm's length. (This individual did not see the object but she heard the noise it made. This noise nearly defied description; it was described as a sort of roary, but not like a jet; it was a low rumbling noise, almost a vibration, which this investigator undoubtedly heard in the wake of the object by the tires of a Diesel truck when one is following close behind at a high speed, rather than the sound of a Diesel engine. The general impression, which was quite accurate, was of a loud rumbling noise which had been superimposed. The noise was described as very loud.

Perhaps a fifty feet more than about three hundred feet cut out in the west field, perhaps fifty feet more than that from the bedroom window, and said that the object apparently passed by at about that distance. He estimated its speed at seventy miles per hour. From the bedroom window, the object would have been seen at an elevation of about thirty degrees, and it appeared to move to the house, one on each side of the window, but not directly in front of it. At the distance estimated, and at a speed of 103 feet per second, the time of visibility would be approximately 1.5 seconds. This would correspond to a distance of about six seconds obtained from a re-enactment. If the six seconds is taken as the proper time interval, then the object was travelling at an angular rate of 3 degrees per second. At the distance of the tripline pole, which would correspond to a linear velocity of about 40 miles per hour. At the distance estimated at 600 feet away, the angular rate would correspond to 8 degrees per second.

b/o is L-20 a/c equipped with turbine. The normal flight path of these b/o is simulated to read crash into Michigan. (Reference: Lansing Damage sighting). These missions and the associated data of these flights are classified. They were of such a nature as to require immediate control intervention as set forth in an interview with Major Moody at USAP.

Set Moody returned to East Lansing, Michigan at 1600. 

At 1315 set Moody proceeded to the state Journal newspaper office and chose to return home. New reports were gathered for this paper. No additional information was obtained during this interview.

From the state journal office we went directly proceeded to Battle Creek, Michigan arriving at 2100. The following morning, 16 gun attack was made on the Lansing Guard Station and the following day, 15 April, the Capitol City Operations had turned over control of their air space to the highest headquarters and were awaiting orders to resume normal flight operations. The associated helos made 6-7A reconnaisance flights. One of the flights made to the north of the Capitol City was terminated by the South of the city at 1230. Set Moody returned to East Lansing, arriving at 1615.

About 39-40 miles per hour. The actual angle of visibility may be as little as to degrees if account is taken of partial visibility through the trees. The relatively small size of the object would be normal to the line of sight. If this were normal to the line of sight, the speeds would be raised higher.

A point about 1/2 degree had disappeared behind the trees. In about ten minutes, they heard the same sound again, and this time believed at the bedroom window that they could see the object for about five seconds. The direction was the same (approximately) as before.

The object was "much farther" away and appeared half as large as before. As it passed behind the trees at the west end of the field, it appeared smaller in apparent size. Io was still midday, and the shape could not be clearly seen, although it was smaller in apparent size.

The observers say the object clearly on the first pass, both of them. On the second pass, they agreed it was bright like a star, with no discernible shape. The light was white, the remainder being a steady bright red. These lights were described as Mrs. [REDACTED]'s car's going on and off like Christmas-tree lights, and as steady by Mr. [REDACTED]. The whole procedure was completed in two passes, while Mr. [REDACTED] say them both times, once at much closer range.

Both witnesses described the body of the object as glowing, with a single uniform glow illumination of which the color was a pale sort, and found a red pencil with which to sketch its size, as the diameter of their house showed. Her sketch is shown as Fig. 8.

On both passes, the object showed an elongated appearance as it seemed to be tipped somewhat toward or away from the observers.

Witnesses state that the object definitely was not a helicopter, as no National Guard unit is stationed that a very likely source could come from.

Helicopters both day and night in the area; both witnesses are quite positive that the objects observed were round or near spherical in shape with solid outlines, and cannot reasonably be thought to have made the suggested motions.
Helicopters were flown in that area on the same night, but caused sensations several hours before the sighting.
An estimate of the minimum size of the subject can be obtained from the resolved power of the dark-adapted eye,and an assumption that the subject was just beyond the trees on its second pass and 800 feet high.
According to the statistics obtained(from this view rather than a realistic perspective drawing)the minimum diameter between the lights corresponds to about 2/3 of the radius of the presumed circular object.
The dark-adapted normal eye resolution is about 1 minute of arc. If the subject was 800 feet away and the minimum distance between the lights subtended an angle of 1 minute, then the diameter of the object would be about 13 feet - this by the report is not more than 3.5 feet in diameter. Clearly, it was not that small.
An attempt was made to determine the apparent size of the object as observed by both witnesses may at one point "much larger" when the size appears to have increased 1.5 to 4 times their own apparent diameter, if one is not more than 3.5 feet in diameter.

Flying Saucer Puzzle Grows
It May Be Helicopter-or It May Not

In Lansing's night, swooping Eider, U.F.O. (Unidentified Flying Object), which was voted "the most unpredictable" by area residents, Twas reported to have been seen by at least three persons, including a police officer, during the first hour of Thursday morning.

There was some indication to the effect that this U.F.O. may have been a helicopter, but this is not conclusive, according to the officials who handled the report.

The police officer, veteran of several years service, reported he was attracted to the object by a close examination to determine just what it was.

"There was a larger area red light which went out and then came on again," the officer stated.

The object seemed to be hovering at a point about 500 to 600 feet above the ground. It was observed for a period of around 10 minutes, then it moved off in a westerly direction at a high rate of speed.

Another resident, who was working late, also spotted the object and called the police. A third person, a nurse, reported seeing it from a distance about the same time.

The police have informed the Air Force and the U.F.O. Investigating group of this latest sighting, but have not as yet received any report or information as to whether it may have been some type of military aircraft, helicopter or a U.F.O.

The report states that the police officer who saw the object said it resembled a helicopter at the start, but within a very few minutes it seemed to take on the appearance of a smaller object, possibly a U.F.O.

When it moved off rapidly, the officer said "it didn't seem like any copter I ever saw."

Low flying objects reported have created much controversy and speculation locally. Last Thursday, several persons reported seeing a similar type of object in the early hours of the morning over the east side of the city.

Police have stressed that these objects remain unidentified as to their true nature at this time. They are continuing their investigation and seeking any further information from the public which may help solve the puzzle.

Extracted text from the document:

Subsequent to their observation they had received numerous telephone calls from others in the area who had observed or heard the same existing object. The witnesses stated that the object was approximately 50 feet in diameter and described the sound as extremely loud. They received a call from a nurse at the Lansing County Jail who had also observed the object and a member of the township fire Marshall, had observed the object that same night.

The witnesses stated that the object was silent as a child a few months old and was the one that was awakened by the noise. The noise of the object did not disturb the sleeping child. Also, Mr. Moody observed that the object appeared in the sky and is attested to awaken at a bell, siren or telephone.

Following the interview with Mr. and Mrs. Moody and Bill Powers, they described to the home of Sgt. Moody and Sgt. Bill Powers at Grand Ledge, Michigan (about three miles east of Grand Ledge). During the interview, it was apparent that the sighting was not related to those objects with similar observed during the latter part of May. As they departed in their car, they turned on to a road leading to their home.

EXTRACT FROM HILL POWER'S REPORT ON TRIP TO LANSING

DeLa County Police Department (located on Highway 127, south of Lansing and Grand Ledge) was awakened by a loud roaring noise, which sounded very close and did not seem to be moving away. He looked out his bedroom window, and saw the front yard and fireplace lit up as "bright as day". The Chief jumped into his pants (just a few seconds required, he explained, owing to his agility), and went down to the fire engine garage and out the door. He had shone the light down the driveway, but no source could be seen.

Then he looked up, and saw a blinding white light-source, larger in diameter than a searchlight, definitely not a point source or a small headlight-sized object. The light came from this object, which was illuminating a circular area on the ground surrounding it, across the highway into the fields, with a radius estimated by the Chief (and checked by illuminated landmarks) of 200 feet. The Chief, being extremely, explained that the object saw nothing further - he looked away - he is susceptible to night-blindness; the light turned off almost immediately after he saw it, and he could see nothing for a considerable time afterwards.

All during the experience, the police radio in the police car was broadcasting its normal signals - there seemed to move straight up and then on to the east toward Lansing, just about directly down the highway. The Chief had difficulty describing his emotions - he kept saying that it had been extremely loud, and that he had never heard anything like it before, not even an aircraft sound, jet or helicopter. The light was on for three or four minutes. Chief is judgment checked out), altogether, and was described as being of very adequate intensity to make the surroundings quite as bright as day, at it has made the Chief stagger back, he did not feel any noise.

Practically every word for a loud noise was tried out, and was still not quite right. Finally the investigator who had been previously some aircraft sightings made a noise at about 9 above Middle C, a steady and loud falsetto note with a "burr" in it, which represented his estimate of what the others had heard. He remarked "That is to what I heard!" He remarked several times how surprised he was that the exact sound should have been reproduced so closely. "You couldn't t have done that, even!" He stated that he had not similar experiences.

The Chief then mentioned several other people who, after being questioned, had made some statements about what they had heard, so their investigators will report on those sightings.

Further evaluation is deferred to the end of this report.

S. , USAF, 23 May, 1964. Cloud pushing, case 6.30PM, USAF DISTRICT, 20th CO,USAF SRC, Warren Michigan. Witness, white, female, age 52, present for record, has had some previous experience with National Guard and Air Force aerial activities, retired (WAAC), Lansing, Michigan.
