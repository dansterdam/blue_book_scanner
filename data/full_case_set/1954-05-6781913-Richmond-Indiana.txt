RICHMOND, INDIANA
24 MAY 1954

At 1225 (EST) on 24 May 1954, an Air Force Major, flying a photographic mapping mission near Richmond, Indiana, observed and photographed what appeared to be a large, high-intensity light moving below his aircraft. The light traveled a distance of six miles over the ground at a speed twice that of the aircraft.

Intensive studies of the photographs were made. The studies indicated that the light was not a material object.

Extensive investigations, exploring all possible clues and avenues of approach to the probable nature of the object were made.

The ground under both the path taken by the aircraft and the object were examined with a fine tooth comb. Photographs were made of the area for a study of ground characteristics or other clues. Aircraft flights, radar units and other operations were immediately checked carefully, with negative results.

The data was submitted to a panel of scientists and specialists, which included astronomers, meteorologists, and a physicist. It was concluded that the sighting was a very rare aerial phenomena caused by the reflection of the sun's rays upon an ice-crystal plate formation.

Ruppelt, formerly head of the Project "Bluebook" investigation on unidentified aerial phenomena, states in the report on May 22, 1954 that while the photograph appears to show only lights, he would refrain from referring to it as anything more than an unidentified object. I wonder if it is possible to determine to what it actually was. In the future if similar photographic evidence appears, I would be grateful if some one could make an analysis of it again. My own evaluation is simply a review of what this photograph shows, which, as mentioned, appears only as lights, but I would not like to refer to it as anything more than just that - an unidentified object.

1. The sighting referred to in the attached letter from Mr. Taylor is carried in the ATIC file as a reflection.
2. The object was very distinctive overhead and the witness was sure enough to get a photograph (the aircraft from which this sighting took place had photography equipment).
3. While there are certain errors in the reporting, which can probably be attributed to the first excitement of the observer, the photograph, when compared with the data and the position of the B-17, leaves no doubt that the object is a reflection of the airplane.

The photograph has a grainy, low-quality appearance, suggesting it may be an older or damaged image. The only text visible in the image is a handwritten annotation that says "Gunn" in the bottom right corner.

Project Blue Book Report Text:

The individual sighted was awakened at 0120 EST on 6 May 1954 by a bright light shining in the window. When he looked outside, he observed an object shaped like two saucers inverted and joined together with a glowing ring around the center. The object was hovering about 100 feet above the ground at an estimated distance of 1/4 mile. It was estimated to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. The object remained visible for about 1 minute before ascending straight up and disappearing from sight.

REPORT ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
On May 6, 1954, at approximately 8:00 P.M., the undersigned observed two unidentified objects in the sky over Richmond, Indiana.
The objects were first observed as small points of light in the western sky. As they approached, they increased in size and brightness. One object was circular in shape, while the other was more irregular in outline.
The circular object appeared to be surrounded by a luminous halo. Both objects moved in an erratic manner, changing direction and speed abruptly.
After several minutes, the objects disappeared rapidly, moving in a northeasterly direction.
There were no other witnesses to this incident. The undersigned has had no previous experience in observing unidentified flying objects.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
RICHMOND, INDIANA
MAY 6, 1954

On May 6, 1954, at approximately 7:30 p.m. EDT, Mr. M.W. of Richmond, Indiana, reported sighting an unidentified flying object in the sky over Richmond. Mr. M.W. stated that he was standing in his backyard when he observed a dark, oblong object moving across the sky at a high rate of speed from east to west. He described the object as appearing to be approximately 50 feet in length and traveling at an estimated speed of 600 to 700 miles per hour. Mr. M.W. reported that the object was completely silent and left no visible trail. He stated that the object was visible for approximately 10 to 15 seconds before disappearing from sight.

An investigation of this sighting was conducted by personnel from the U.S. Air Force. No further details or conclusions regarding the identity of the observed object are provided in the documentation.

MEMORANDUM FOR Director of Intelligence
ATTN: Chief of Intelligence

SUBJECT: (UNCI) Unidentified Flying Object Information

1. An unidentified flying object was sighted and photographed near Richmond, Indiana on 19 May 1954 at 2255 hrs (EST) by Capt. Hardin of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, while on a photo mapping mission. The object was bright and luminous and appeared to be circular. It was estimated that the length of the object was 30-40 ft and the width was 15-20 ft. The object was observed to the right of the aircraft and was moving at a high speed over the ground (500 mph) disappearing to the left of the aircraft. The object was observed for a distance of approximately 6 miles over the ground (500 mph).  

2. The photograph as well as the description by the observer, indicate the object could have been at an altitude of approximately 6,000 ft or could have been at 5,000 ft if at ground level.

3. Major [redacted] is considered to be a very reliable and accurate observer.

4. The photograph was taken straight down with a mapping camera. The weather was clear in the area. Sun altitude was 70 degrees. Visibility was 10 miles and altitude was 10,000 ft.

5. Aircraft activity and radar plots in the area have been checked with negative results. The report has been photographed for a study of the ground characteristics.

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that discusses observations of reflected light from ice crystals in the sky. The document contains detailed descriptions of the observed phenomenon, including the date, location, time of day, and weather conditions. It also discusses the diffraction patterns and apparent distortion of the central image, as well as the effect of changes in the density of the ice crystals on the reflected image. However, there is no photograph or image included in this particular page of the document.

Here is the text from the document, as an OCR output:

NOTE ON REFLECTION AND DIFFRACTION FROM ICE CRYSTALS IN THE SKY
- Charles F. Squires, The Rice Institute, Houston, Texas 
(Received June 9, 1952)

Observations of the reflected light from ice crystals in the sky have been made for centuries and such natural phenomenon as "mock suns" are well known. On February 6, 1952, I observed and repeatedly photographed the reflections of sunlight from ice crystals flying in an airplane at 12,000 ft. over the mountain country of Tennessee. The time of day was approximately noon, and it was cold. The ground below was visible through the blue haze caused by the ice crystals. The reflected image of the sun was so intense that the camera speed was 1/200 sec and the aperture was nearly closed. The dark green of the mountain trees and a stream in a valley can be seen in Fig. 1. 

The diffraction ring around the central image is just what one would expect from light coming through these ice crystals. It is interesting to note that the image and diffraction rings have an elliptical shape, and I confess that I do not know why this is so. Certainly the ice crystals have their flat surfaces all normal to the vertical. The assumption that a wind could produce an ordering orientation of the crystals in the horizontal plane would allow one to suppose a different diffraction spacing in the x direction than in the y direction. This would give an elliptical diffraction ring, but I do not understand why the central image should be out of round. The spot of light would sometimes be close to the aircraft (it appeared large) and would sometimes be far away (it appeared small). The image kept the angle of reflection of the sun's rays, and this was checked repeatedly when the image coincided with the sun's reflection from a body of water on the ground below. A change of density of the ice crystals would cause the apparent shift in distance. Since the spot of light kept pace with the aircraft, it must have been close to the aircraft.

The text of the document is as follows:

RICHMOND, INDIANA
24 MAY 1954

At 1225 (EST) on 24 May 1954, an Air Force Major, flying a photographic mapping mission near Richmond, Indiana, observed and photographed what appeared to be a large, high-intensity light moving below his aircraft. The light traveled a distance of six miles over the ground at a speed twice that of the aircraft.

Intensive studies of the photographs were made. The studies indicated that the light was not a material object.

Extensive investigations, exploring all possible clues and avenues of approach to the probable nature of the object were made. The ground under both the path taken by the aircraft and the object were examined with a fine tooth comb. Photographs were made of the area for a study of ground characteristics or other clues. Aircraft flights, radar units and other operations were immediately checked carefully, with negative results.

The data was submitted to a panel of scientists and specialists, which included astronomers, meteorologists, and a physicist. It was concluded that the sighting was a very rare aerial phenomena caused by the reflection of the sun's rays upon an ice-crystal platellette formation.
