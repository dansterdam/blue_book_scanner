The Raleigh Times. Raleigh. North Carc "Flying Saucers"
Reported Active
Over Warren Sky
WARRENTON, Oct. 26 - Strange ob
jects were reported seen in the sky over
Warren County during the weekend to pre
sent the latest claims of "flying saucers"
activity here.
Two witnesses, Mr. and Mrs. Sallie
White, were among those who reported see
ing the unusual lighter-than-air
craft, glowing with a bluish
color, and apparently indulging in what ap
peared to be evasive maneuvers.
According to Mrs. White, she and her
husband, Claude, saw the objects about 8:30
o'clock Saturday night. She described them
as round, glowing bodies that "seemed to
be flying in some kind of formation."
Other witnesses, including Mr. and Mrs.
Boyce, also reported seeing the objects. Both
couples said the strange bodies would sud
denly vanish and then reappear at another
point in the sky.
The illuminated objects seemed
particularly close to the earth and
at times quite distant, Mrs. White
told. Dozens of persons in this
area became interested observers
of the strange goings-on in the sky.
Suggestions as to the nature or identity
of the mysterious flying objects varied.
Some said they couldn't seem to get a
close enough look to determine exactly what
they were. Others called them "flying sau
cers," illuminated bubbles, or
indescribable, whirling, silvery-hued
objects that were moving at apparently
tremendous speeds.
The Warrenton citizens who witnessed
the aerial display were not alone in their
observations, according to previous reports.
Strange "saucer-like" objects have been
reported seen over various sections of the
state in recent weeks, arousing curiosity
and speculation as to their origin
and nature. Just what the strange
sky visitors may be is still a matter
of conjecture.

Statement of **************************

On 25 October 1950, at 1242, as I was traveling SE on Highway 421, 3 miles west of Boalsburg, N.C., I sighted an unidentified object in the sky. The object appeared to be a disc-like shape with a dull reddish glow to a dull graying mixture. The object kept the same shape but appeared to be shifting in position, and appeared to be equivalent to two B-36 fuselages stacked one above the other.

The object appeared to be about two miles distant, and as I watched it, I observed it slowly move across the highway from SE to NW over a 30 second period and disappeared into the overcast SSW. Overcast was 600-700 feet.

The next time I saw it, it appeared to be about a distance of 40 seconds, when I first saw it. I thought possibly it was a water tank in Boalsburg, until it started moving.

The observation was visual from the surface. 

I am a former Air Force pilot, and my home address is ************** Street, Greensboro, N.C.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

LOCATION: Roswell, New Mexico
DATE: 17 September 1950
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Objects (Balloons)
UNITS INVOLVED: 509th Bomb Group, 8th Air Force
PERSONNEL: Sergeant Erwin Stonesifer, Corporal James Knight, Private First Class Robert H. Jones

SUMMARY: (brief summary of report, 6th paragraph and 2nd sentence are most significant)
At approximately 2100 hours on 17 September 1950 while on guard duty, witnesses noticed several unidentified aerial objects in the sky over the base area. Four objects were observed at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. They appeared to the witnesses to be round, silver, and silent. It was estimated that they were approximately 50 feet in diameter and traveled at a speed of 300-400 miles per hour. The objects were first observed traveling in a north to south direction, and then disappeared from sight to the south. The objects could not be identified positively, but it is believed they may have been high altitude weather balloons.

A check with the Base Operations revealed that there were no aircraft in the local area at the time of this observation.

A check with the Base Weather Station revealed that the ceiling was twenty-three thousand (23,000) feet and that visibility was thirteen (13) miles.

The Early Warning Radar Station, this Base, was inoperative at the time of this observation.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned document from Project Blue Book. The document appears to be an intelligence report dated 7 November 1950, discussing reports of unconventional aircraft.

Spot Intelligence Report, DO #9, 7 Nov 50, subject: Reports of Unconventional Aircraft

HOW I HAVE KEPT QUIET ABOUT IT ALL THIS TIME, BUT WE MUST WRITE AND TELL YOU ABOUT IT: THE SIGNED

The report discusses editorials from a New Orleans newspaper on 17 October 1950 concerning sightings of "foo fighters". It mentions the Air Force's hesitation to call these sightings "Unidentified Flying Objects" and a desire to avoid speculation about the nature of the sightings. The report indicates that no action is being contemplated by the headquarters at this time.

The document is stamped "UNCLASSIFIED" and includes a handwritten signature at the bottom.

Spot Intelligence Report, DO FD. 7 Nov 50.
Aircraft:
(a) From the hospital, they were more than a mile distant.
(b) Manner of Observation: Visual from a window of Hospital. Observable for approximately two (2) hours.
(c) Description: Twelve (12) shiny, apparently metallic, diving, spinning objects with round bodies and short wings. Objects were silhouetted against the sky and left no visible exhaust trails. They appeared to be constantly spinning to a definite pattern of motion.
(d) No physical evidence was obtainable. No meteorological conditions were reported which could have accounted for this sighting.
The eyewitness since 1930, carried the following account of "flying discs" reportedly sighted by members of a family of Jacksonville, Louisiana on 5 November 1950:
"Jensonville, Nov 6 (Special) - "Flying saucers" made their first reported appearance over Catahoula Parish Monday, according to Cleve Poyton, a farmer who lives nearby. About 1:45 p.m. Judy, the family cook, was on her way home after washing the dinner dishes. She rushed back into the house shouting: "There's photos done come after we might in the broad open daylight." They're hovering right out there over the trees." 
Several members of the Poyton family rushed outside to see the saucer, which at that time had risen to about 60 feet above the ground.
"It's Poyton said what they saw was "so bright and shiny we couldn't tell anything about its shape or size."
As they watched, he said, the saucer went up to the northwest. There were twin exhausts, such as made by jet planes, but the exhausts did not stay parallel, he said.

Spot Intelligence Report - 7 Nov 50. subject: Reports of Unconventional Aircraft.

The Peyton said he got a pocket telescope and watched the saucer-like object hover over the railroad tracks. The object did not hurry, it took its time and disappeared from sight in about five minutes. After it had disappeared, the vapor trail appeared to be red and then bluish.

The Peyton said that there were two of them things over the tractor shed and they were long and round like a cigar.

The following letter was printed in the New Orleans Times-Picayune of 18 October 1950:
"Editor, The Times-Picayune - I read again this morning of these pilots who didn't believe in "flying saucers" but who actually saw them and now believe.
"Some time ago a soldier in Arizona said he saw a rocket ship 75 to 100 feet long that solidier that he wasn't seeing things because I believe I saw it too.
"You see it was this way. Back in 1947 we were out on the landing strip. It was just before midnite. I was lying on my back on the top step of the sidewall when I had the feeling that somebody was staring at me. I looked over and saw a strange object pass over me, but nobody was looking at me, but they were all gazing up at the sky and they couldn't have seen me there.
"All of a sudden I looked up at the sky and there was this object. It looked to me at the moment like a star. What was strange it kept my eyes on it and called to the others to look at it. But all of a sudden it made a darting movement and then another and they were saying "Did you see that" and we could hardly believe our eyes. Each time it took a darting movement it traveled a little way with the first puff, but with the second puff it traveled quite a distance."
