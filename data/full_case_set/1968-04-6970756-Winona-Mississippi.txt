Aprile 20, 1969

The missile was seen about 9:00 p.m. on the evening of April 19, 1969. It was a clear sky, with a bright moon. The object was first seen in the northwest and travelled in a southeast direction, finally disappearing in the southeast. The missile made no sound and was observed for about 10 minutes.

The witness was Mr. E. G. Brock, a retired colonel in the U.S. Air Force. He is a highly reputable and reliable person. The object appeared to be approximately 5 to 10 miles away and at an estimated altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The object was described as a luminous, bright object that appeared to pulsate or flicker at times. It left no trail and did not appear to be an aircraft or conventional missile.

EXTRACTED TEXT:

The meeting was attended by several guests, some known, some strangers to the witness. They were not invited but came on their own as if they knew Almeida was going to be there. They formed a circle around him and conversed in whispers.

Almeida became nervous and excused himself saying he had to leave on an errand. As he walked away, the group parted to let him through and then closed the circle again. Almeida did not return and the group eventually dispersed.

The witness stated he believes Almeida was afraid of these people and did not want to remain with them. The witness could not identify any of the individuals in the group but stated they appeared to be in some kind of conspiratorial meeting or discussion.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains handwritten text that appears to be an excerpt from a document or report.

The text reads:

The sighting was reported to be a highly unusual occurrence. This object was apparently seen by several observers and was reported to be a strange luminous object, larger than the usual size of a star or planet, and moving at a high rate of speed, making sudden changes in direction and altitude. 

There is no further information or analysis provided in the text. The text appears to be a summary or description of a reported UFO sighting.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

The night was passing normally, but around 10:00 - 10:30 p.m. a peculiar light was seen, apparently hanging stationary or moving very slowly across the sky. It was a rather pronounced illumination or glow, although it did not resemble the appearance or lighting characteristics of an aircraft or a helicopter.

The light moved slowly and irregularly. During the time of observation, it did not appear to extinguish or disappear, but simply faded out of sight. It brightened at times and dimmed at other times, moving in an erratic manner.

It was not the appearance or lighting characteristics of an aircraft or a helicopter. The night seemed calm and clear. The light was out in the open sky, about one-third the distance up to the horizon.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a handwritten document. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I shall proceed to extract and output all the text present in the document:

postoffice right end of road
ounse. Traveling eastone slight southeasterly direction. No one was
reported near the scene at the time. However, there was a strong odor
of gasoline in the area. The object was circular in shape,
had a neon-like glow, and was silent in operation. It appeared to
hover approximately 20 feet above the ground for a period of 15 to 20
minutes before it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous
speed and disappeared from sight to the northeast.
Checks were made at the scene, but no trace of any landing
or physical evidence could be found. Nothing unusual was observed
in the area prior to or after the sighting.
Attempt is being made to interview additional witnesses
in an effort to obtain more detailed information. This report
is being submitted for your information and evaluation.

To transcribe the text in the document:

The night lights on the road. The lightning Seemed to be more of something being raised up and down. The lights were low to the ground and moving towards the South. They seem to be moving with great speed and intensity, covering the ground very rapidly. I watched, spellbound, for some fifteen minutes or more. They went out of sight behind the trees in the distance. The same lights reappeared in the same area, moving rapidly again and disappearing behind the trees. They reappeared a third time, high in the sky like a shooting star but brighter, disappearing almost instantly. The lights were distinct, being low and close to the ground at first, then high up like a shooting star. This happened three times during the observation.

Fading and blowing odors seemed difficult to the 
Senses. As it we're like a breeze remindentr of...

The object was about 11:30 p.m. which were an unusual
grayish white slightly brighter than the full moon. It 
would not normal be noted but was quite noticeable until
it gradually became dimmed and obscured as though
it were or sort of went right into a distant cloud cover.
It did not wobble or vary in shape but seemed to gradually
grow dim and disappear. We could hear no sound, but the 
whole incident was quite abnormal and not accounted for 
in any other way. While we could obviously have been
a meteor or some sort of unusual astronomical phenomena
it did not seem to be observed in the normal manner of
a meteor. The object itself did not seem to have any
visible movement, but rather seem to diminish in
brightness until it disappeared entirely.

The image contains a questionnaire form titled "SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE". It includes a sketch with an observer's viewpoint and lines showing the observed object's angular position and elevation relative to the horizon. There is no photograph present in this image.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

I was with this particular group in the early part of the evening. I do not remember exactly the time, but it was around 9:45 or 10 o'clock. We were standing in the middle of a cotton field, about a quarter of a mile west of my home. The object was overhead and practically stationary. It appeared to be round or oval in shape, and was giving off a reddish-orange glow. At times we could see it pulsate or throb. It seemed to be at an altitude of about 1,000 feet, or possibly higher. The size appeared to be about 50 to 60 feet in diameter. This object remained in the same general location for at least 30 to 45 minutes, during which time we observed it very closely. At one point, it seemed to diminish in size and brightness, almost as if it was going behind a cloud, but there were no clouds in the sky at the time. After a short time, it regained its original size and brightness. Finally, it just simply faded out, as if it had gone behind something, and disappeared from our view. There was no sound whatsoever associated with this object. I have no idea what it was, and can only describe what I and the others saw. I hope this information is of some help to you.

This page from the Project Blue Book report does not contain any photographs. However, it does contain two illustrations: one is a sketch with angles and a compass rose, and the other is a blank space with instructions for the observer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place a "T" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
