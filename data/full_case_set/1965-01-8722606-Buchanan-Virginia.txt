ON 8 DEC SIGHTING. NO ATYPICAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS OBSERVED AS A RESULT OF THIS OPERATION, HOWEVER, THE CALL WAS RECEIVED, AND THE AREA SCANNED AT 2345Z, 45 MINUTES AFTER THE SIGHTING.

CONTENTS IN VIEW OF THE CHILDREN'S AGES, THE ABSENCE OF CORROBORATING EVIDENCE AND INSUFFICIENT TIME SPAN, THIS SIGHTING DOES NOT APPEAR TO WARRANT FURTHER INVESTIGATION. I DO NOT WISH TO RESTRICT IN ANY WAY THE CAPABILITY OF THE CHILDREN OR THE CREDIBILITY OF SUCH SIGHTING. HOWEVER, THE FACTS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO FORM A DEFINITE EVALUATION.

1. EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NONE
