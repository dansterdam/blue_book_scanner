PRELIMINARY REPORT ON DR. HYNEK'S OBJECT

The following remarks are based on conversations with members of the Geology Department. Greater detail would require removal of a portion of the object for microscopic study.

This is a clay-limestone concretion, with an outer rim of marcasite (FeS2) and an interior probably of argillaceous siderite (FeCO3). This concretion probably split along the original bedding of the host rock. 

It is definitely a terrestrial object. Concretions of this sort are common in the Pennsylvanian strata of Illinois.

The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document with text describing the contents of a case file, which includes "one (1) piece of tract" and "two (2) 3" x 10" photos" and "two (2) negatives". The text accurately describes the contents of the case file, but there are no actual photographs present in the shared image.

The image contains a photograph of what appears to be an unidentified flying object (UFO) or aerial phenomenon. The image shows a dark, elongated object with a visible structure or frame. It is positioned on what looks like some kind of platform or table. The image is in black and white.

Here is the text I've extracted from the document:

The image contains a black and white photograph of what appears to be a UFO or some kind of unidentified aerial object. The shape of the object is roughly conical or triangular, with a jagged or irregular surface texture. The image does not contain any human faces or identifiable individuals.

Text from the document:

SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object Sighting
LOCATION: Fairfield, Illinois
DATE: October 9, 1963

The witness, an unnamed civilian, reported observing an unidentified aerial object in the sky over Fairfield, Illinois on the evening of October 9, 1963. The witness provided a sketch of the object, which is included in the case file.

According to the report, the object appeared to be triangular or conical in shape, with a rough, irregular surface. The witness estimated the size of the object to be approximately 30 feet in length. The object was observed for several minutes before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view.

No further details or analysis are provided in the case file.

PRELIMINARY REPORT OF DR. HENRY'S OBJECT

The following remarks are based on conversations with members of the Geology Department. Greater detail would require removal of a portion of the object for microscopic study.

This is a clay-ironstone concretion, with an outer rim of marcasite (FeS2) and an interior probably of argillaceous siderite (FeCO3). This concretion probably splits along the original bedding of the host rock.

It is definitely a terrestrial object. Concretions of this sort are common in the Pennsylvania strata of Illinois.

Dear Sir:
I am referring your report of the 24 NOVEMBER SIGHTING, SCOTT AIR FORCE BASE. on behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force, to thank you for your cooperation.

The scientific analysis and evaluation which I have made indicates that your SIGHTING was something of an unusual nature. I have carefully examined the results of our technical investigations involving scientific analysis, and I believe that this object appears to have no identifiable value to the Air Force. I have made a detailed study of the composition and probable background of the object.

A detailed analysis of the object was made, and it appears that your object contains no substance hazardous to our materials. Therefore, your science class might be interested in our findings: Wherefore, I will send you the results of our findings soon as it becomes available. At the conclusion of this Case, I will close your case. 

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR.
