Hardly able to believe this whole thing ago for possibly on the activity of the unit. Gentle true and the only reason I'm falling out this form is because the USAF what 
I saw was made sights I'll although while spending it did have a "saucer-like" shape. I thought maybe it would be helpful since I've never heard of any one sighting a radio shaped object O.J.O. before.

Gentlemen,

I hesitated to write because of some of the explanations the Air Force has been giving for 'reports, but I feel the facts in this case are worth submitting to you.

On the evening of March 30, 1967, at approximately 8:30 p.m., I was out on my back porch. It was a clear, cool evening. As I was walking home I saw a star-like object in the sky moving rapidly across the eastern horizon. At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it was traveling much too fast for that. I watched it through my binoculars and it appeared to be a solid object, definitely not an airplane or satellite. It was brilliantly lit, almost like a star, and seemed to be revolving or spinning. After traveling a considerable distance, it suddenly made a sharp turn and headed north at an even greater speed, then it was gone. I have observed several such objects through binoculars on one night as a gift was possessed - the lights seem to appear and disappear.

- page 5 -

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book document. It seems to be a handwritten narrative describing a UFO sighting.

TRANSCRIPT:

It was about 9:10 P.M. March 7, 1967 that my husband and I were driving down a country road. I was looking to the right and I saw a bright object with a white light on top and 2 white lights (one on each end).

It looked like it was about 30 feet long. I couldn't tell how wide but it was definitely not round. And the lights was a perfect circle (about once per second). And the light would seem to dim and then brighten. The object seemed to be hovering over the plane. It was quite a distance until the plane was directly under it. Then the light would seem to dim and then brighten. The object seemed to be just hovering there. I don't think they saw the object. I was telling my husband but he didn't seem too excited about it. Be seemed to think it was just reflecting. I saw this for about 30 seconds.

The image does not contain a photograph, it is a handwritten document. I will now proceed to extract all the text from the document:

"met a house about 6 miles
straight to the west and
stopped the watch it. we
watched it for some time,
about 3 to 4 minutes. It
moved to the opposite side of us, about
a quarter of a mile and then
shot straight up. We watched it
till it went out of sight.

The object was about 30 feet in
diameter and seemed to be some
type of aircraft with a brilliant white
light in the center. It made no noise
whatsoever. When it shot straight up,
it gathered speed very rapidly and
was out of sight in a matter of
seconds.

We were in the car with the
motor running and the lights on.
When the object moved to the opposite
side, it cast a light on the ground
around our car like moonlight. No
other aircraft were visible and the
night was clear and still.

Please forward this to Blue Book.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document describing an encounter with an unidentified flying object.

Text in the document:

started watching it at about 10;30 and it seemed to be about 30 ft. above the ground (about 100 ft.) and it got lighter to the sky. I had advised on from by them. The UFO seemed to be about 50 ft. across and stopped right over our car, about 3 ft. and the light of us. It was hovering about 3 to 10 ft. of the ground. I got a good look at it and I knew we had never seen anything like it. I saw something metallic I seen something was something up passed us. My husband drove on about 90 mph, away the direction we had watched. I looked up once and the UFO was directly over us going might along with us. when we reached the edge of the road we looked and it was gone.

Text extracted from the document:

He said driving but he soon it stopped anything from this earth! We never noticed what happened to the fire. soldier U.S became we were scared to death of the other me. I do know it was almost daylight visible and what I can never say. 

I'll try to describe for what it stoppedabout 12 to 15 feet equal, it was a perfect cube with white as a large a sample side of the cube. On 7 brilliant and lights. The lights no bright shing directly on us. perhaps this is why we could saw the altitude.

There is no photograph present in the image provided. This appears to be a handwritten document containing text only.

I will now act as an OCR (optical character recognition) system and extract all the text from the document:

I didnʼt see the bottom because it was slanted slightly forward as in the movement seemed to be off. The camerawas related up in there could have been a slight noise that I donʼt hear. But I would have head of there had been much noise.

What an estimated cost was to find, not a balloon told definite not a plane or helicopter. It remain from after-spaie. 

I know you for the in Washington but believe in USCO that this one, sure no mistake. And a bi-detail figure what if the truth.

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch or diagram of what seems to be a UFO or unidentified aerial object. The object is depicted with a dome-shaped top and a flat bottom, with labels indicating "green" and "red" for the color of the object. There are also some text annotations around the object, including "our position" and "road".

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is dated October 9, 1967 and is addressed to Mrs. [REDACTED], Longbottom, Ohio. The letter is from RUSS G. MANATT, Colonel, USAF, Director of Technology and Subsystems, and discusses the inability to conduct a complete investigation of a reported UFO sighting due to insufficient data.

The text in the document is as follows:

"DSET/UPO (Ma.)- Quintanilla/70916/ssf/9 oct 67

UFO Observation of March 9, 1967

Mrs. [REDACTED] 
Longbottom, Ohio

1. It is necessary to know that we are making a complete investigation could not be made. It is important that an individual report their sightings immediately to the nearest Air Force Base.

2. It is necessary to know if there was any air activity in the area described in the report. However, the information from them did not find anything that fits their description. 

3. Because we cannot make a comprehensive evaluation of your sighting, we felt it necessary to classify your report as Insufficient Data.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

30. Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before? If so give date or dates and location.
I have seen several unidentified objects and other strange things several times and after the lights at Twinky Hutter of Alice, I think they were quite similar.

31. Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object? (Circle One)
Yes  No
31.1 IF you answered YES, did they see the object too? (Circle One) 
Yes  No

31.2 Please list their names and addresses:
Livingston, Ohio

TELEPHONE NUMBER: [REDACTED]
AGE: 30  SEX: Female
Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experiences, which might be pertinent.
I have seen quite a number of unidentified objects and things that I think are highly intelligent and I think any intelligent person would still be very mystified about such a common object at such a close distance.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? 
3/8   South Air Force Base, Washington, D.C. 1967

- page 18 -

The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text on a page.

The text output is as follows:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 6 July 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The UFO was gaining to the right and when it stopped it sailed down very quickly. I have been reading books about UFOs ever since this experience as I've read about the theory that 3/4 of the sightings are probably just some sort of anti-gravity device. I don't know much about flying but I think the fact that it was gaining in a straight line and then made a very quick vertical maneuver indicates that gravity had something to do with it. They may be of the USPO had been in the southern hemisphere it would have been spinning to the left. And maybe that's appearing just enough it can't include this.
