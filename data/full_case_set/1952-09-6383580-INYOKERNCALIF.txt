AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM:  CFPT2 - Composite Wing, Reno, Nevada 
STATEMENT OF MR. ------, RESIDING AT RENO, NEVADA
Col Barrington:  Lt. -----, the USAF at the University of Nevada called us by telephone. He was working with this object in the sky. Will you tell us about these?
Mr. ------: I was coming from Los Angeles to Bishop last weekend and I spotted something that kept moving. It was at middle between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m. when I first saw it. It looked about the size of a star, when I first saw it (longer about his arm's length, diameter size of three fingers). So I looked about him to see if anyone else could see it and there was no one that I could see. As I kept watching it, it seemed to be turning from a light yellow to a light silver color. Anyone can see it high and it kept turning from a light silver to a light, silver-white color and it did that about every two seconds. It changed complete color from light yellow to light silver and it kept revolving in different directions. We were traveling northeast and it kept looking it at that time. It seemed to disappear and left a vapor, tail or streak behind it. It didn't go off straight down and left a vapor behind it. It didn't go off straight down and disappear.
Col Barrington: What was the shape?
Mr. ------: I had a telescope, close and we spotted and sighted it. It was a little glow like a star. It would get brighter and dimmer. I could not say if there was anything else to it. If there were any wings or anything on it, I could not definitely say.
Col Barrington: What about would have been its size on the ground?
Mr. ------: It looked pretty big to me. I could not say just how big, but it looked like the telescope and the last object I saw through the telescope appeared to be 25 or 30 feet in diameter. 
Col Barrington: Could it have been the landing lights on a plane?
Mr. ------: No. Definitely not. I could see that silver round disc against the sky and it helped remain a distinct outline. It was definitely not an aeroplane.
Col Barrington: Was it similar to anything you have seen before?
Mr. ------: I am not.

AF FORM 112--PART II
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1951
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: 3902D, Composite Wing, Strategic Air Command, APO 239, New York, N.Y.
TO: CLASSIFICATION
PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES

Col Harrington: How long did you look at it before you mentioned it to the others?
Mr. *******: Maybe 10 or 15 minutes. I just asked them what it was when we stopped the car and put the telescope on the top of the car. I first saw it right above the car.
Col Harrington: How did you happen to have the telescope with you?
Mr. *******: We were driving from Las Vegas to Los Angeles and I think I showed it to them. I did not take the telescope along and I just left it in the car.
Col Harrington: Did you report this to anyone else?
Mr. *******: No, I did not. People seem to think you are out of your mind if you mention it.
Col Harrington: And what do you think?
Mr. *******: I think it's very logical. I have never seen anything like it before. 
Col Harrington: How about speed? Could you make any guess as to the speed?
Mr. *******: It was not going too fast. I would not tell because I do not know. It seemed to hover and then take off at a tremendous speed. It went way up above us and then disappeared. When I first saw it it was about as big as a silver dollar.
Col Harrington: Can you see that high up?
Mr. *******: Yes, you can.
Col Harrington: How high up?
Mr. *******: We saw it was very clear. You could see the stars up there and the last time I saw it was up it.

Mr. [Redacted]: No and I put three years in the AAF and did a lot of watches and I could distinguish aeroplanes and anything like that, but I never saw anything like that before, but I never saw anything.

Col. Harrington: This was in the vicinity of Inyokern on Saturday, 27 Sept 27.

Mr. [Redacted]: Yes, it was a week ago last Saturday. 

Col. Harrington: And it was at night, between 10 and 10:30 p.m.

Mr. [Redacted]: Yes. It was just like a silver dollar with a shine on the outside. And when it is dove like this a slow inside with a glow inside.

Col. Harrington: Was it moving fast?

Mr. [Redacted]: No. It was going to the northeast because I sighted it by the stars, and it kept parallel all the time, and then it went down with just a flame following. Not a large flame, but just a small flame.

Col. Harrington: Approximately where would you say it came down?

Mr. [Redacted]: To here. It came down in the valley, the last time I looked at it. It seemed to be going down with just a little less speed and then went out completely.

Col. Harrington: Apparently going to the northeast.

Mr. [Redacted]: Yes. 

Col. Harrington: That would be in Death Valley proximately in the vicinity of Daylight Pass. Who else was with you at the time and saw it?

Mr. [Redacted]: My wife was with me and another couple.

Col. Harrington: And the four of you observed this object in the sky?

Mr. [Redacted]: Yes.

Col. Harrington: The first time I ever saw anything like that. I know it is different colors that show from silver and then dark purple and then light purple and then it look like the silver, and then it would just disappear.
