The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a Project 10073 record card with various fields filled out, including the date, location, type of observation, source, number of objects, course, and brief summary of the sighting. The text on the card describes the sighting of an object with red and green lights, which was seen in the sky and was rising slowly until it faded out of view. The object was observed through binoculars for about 10 minutes.
