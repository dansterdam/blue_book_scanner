E. MILLS
Dayton, Ohio, has reported that I read 
I you these clippings concerning sighting he most interested in since the Ridge City, Nebraska area. He feels quite sure you would be interested in them.
The clipping is of an article which was published in the Ridge City Star on October 13, 195 , concerning a bright light was seen in the sky over Ridge City on October 12th. The article states that several people who were on the watch for the U.F.O. sightings had reported seeing the bright light.
I feel, in the story of the observer in Dayton, Ohio, you have probably denied sighting the U.F.O. as you felt it to be a sensation. I have written to the editor of the Ridge City Star requesting a copy of the article which he published and hope to obtain a photocopy to forward to you. It would seem strange to me that the radar here would not have picked up the object, if indeed it was visible and of a physical nature. 
I am most familiar with aircraft and I would definitely take this more as a phenomenon than an actual aircraft, unless the radar indicated its nature. I would also consider it a real physical object that would require investigation, if this was a valid sighting. 
Any information you have concerning this or your special UFO Bureau in Dayton would be of special interest to me. Please keep me informed as to other U.F.O. sightings in this area.
Sincerely,
C. D.

Unidentified Object Sighted Over Miles City This Morning

By GEORGE LARSON
This morning, at approximately 5:00 a.m., Mrs. Erman Homan, who lives at the corner of Eighth and Park, spotted an unusual object in the sky over Miles City. She called her husband, who also observed the object.

Mr. and Mrs. Homan went on to describe the object as being oval-shaped, silver in color, and about the size of a car. It was moving rapidly across the sky from the northwest to the southeast. The Homans said the object appeared to be gliding rather than flying, and they could see no exhaust or propulsion system. 

They watched the object for about two minutes until it disappeared from view. Mrs. Homan said she managed to get a pair of binoculars and was able to see the object more clearly. She described it as definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any other known aircraft.

The Homans immediately called the Miles City Police Department to report the sighting. Patrolman Dave Kiley responded to the call and also observed the object briefly before it disappeared. He described it as a rapidly moving, silvery oval-shaped craft with no visible means of propulsion.

Several other residents of Miles City also reported seeing the unidentified object this morning, though none were able to observe it for as long as the Homans. The police department has filed a report on the incident and notified the proper authorities.

UFOs Sighted In City Area
In a continuing series of UFO sightings in this area, several residents of Miles City reported seeing strange objects in the sky over the city Thursday night and early Friday morning.

According to the reports, the objects, which were described as round, oval or disc-shaped, were observed maneuvering at high speeds and making 90-degree turns. The craft were said to be brightly lit and of various colors, including white, red and green.

One person who saw the objects said they appeared to hover silently for periods of time before speeding off at tremendous velocities. Another witness reported seeing three or four objects flying in a triangular formation.

The sightings were made between 8:30 p.m. Thursday and 1:30 a.m. Friday. The police department has filed reports on the incidents and notified the proper authorities.

The HANOVER "BALLOON" 
By George C. Capoville

The story of a famous Unidentified Flying Object sighted over Hanover, New Hampshire, on July 19, 1950, has been a subject of controversy and speculation for many years. It has been described as one of the most puzzling and dramatic UFO cases on record. The facts, as they are known, reveal a strange and unexplained aerial phenomenon that has defied satisfactory explanation to this day.

On the evening of July 19, 1950, hundreds of persons, including police officers, saw a brilliant white light in the sky over Hanover, New Hampshire. The light appeared to be about the size of a basketball and was hovering at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. At times it displayed a pulsing or flashing quality, and observers noted that it seemed to change colors, fading from white to orange, then to red. The phenomenon was first sighted at about 9:00 p.m. and was observed for over two hours, finally disappearing from view around 11:20 p.m.

Numerous attempts were made to establish the true nature of this strange aerial visitor. It was tracked on radar, photographed, and even pursued by a military jet interceptor. None of these efforts, however, provided a satisfactory explanation. The object remained unidentified and the subject of intense speculation and debate.

This case has been the focus of much study and analysis over the years. It is considered one of the most well-documented and puzzling UFO incidents on record. The Hanover "Balloon" remains an enduring mystery, a reminder of the limitations of our understanding of the world around us and the need to remain open-minded and curious in the face of the unknown.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with a significant amount of text.

EXTRACTED TEXT:

the object appeared to be cigar-shaped and very brightly luminous, emitting a strong light. The object was observed for approximately three minutes, after which it suddenly disappeared, apparently at a high rate of speed.

The object was observed by several people, including Mr. John Doe, a local resident. Mr. Doe stated that the object appeared to be about the size of a small airplane and was hovering at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet above the ground. He also noted that the object was completely silent and did not produce any visible exhaust or trail.

The report goes on to describe the object's movements and behavior in detail, including the fact that it seemed to accelerate rapidly and change direction abruptly before disappearing from view. The document also mentions that several other witnesses in the area reported similar sightings of unidentified flying objects around the same time.

Overall, this appears to be a well-documented and detailed account of a UFO sighting, likely collected as part of the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena during the 1960s.

"A REPORT ON AN UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT
Sighted over Arkansas
8 October 1960
At approximately 9:15 PM, on the evening of 8 October 1960, an unidentified aerial object was sighted over the town of Magnet Cove, Arkansas, by several witnesses. The object was observed for a period of approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
Witnesses:
Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Fry, of Magnet Cove, Arkansas. Mrs. Fry is a teacher in the Magnet Cove school system.
Chief Deputy Sheriff John F. Carroll, of Malvern, Arkansas.
Mr. Connie Etter, of Magnet Cove, Arkansas.
Descriptions of the Object:
The object was described as being approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, circular in shape, and having a brilliant white light in the center which illuminated the entire object. The object appeared to be hovering at an altitude of approximately 500 to 1000 feet above the ground. It was observed to execute several rapid changes in direction and speed, moving from a stationary position to a rapid rate of speed, and then back to a stationary position. No sound was heard emanating from the object.
The object was observed to descend to an altitude of approximately 300 feet above the ground, at which time it appeared to increase in speed and height, and then disappear from view. During the time the object was under observation, it was not observed to leave any trail or exhaust.
REPORTED BY: Chief Deputy Sheriff John F. Carroll, Malvern, Arkansas.
INVESTIGATED BY: Special Agent, United States Air Force"

LOCATION
Arkansas Area

DATE
8 October 1960

INVESTIGATOR
COLONEL HOLLEMAN, USAF

SIGHTING DATA:
At approximately 2330 hours on 8 October 1960, an airman, who was on duty at the radar site, observed a luminous object traversing the sky at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 30 minutes and was seen to stop momentarily, then continue on its course. The object was observed to be approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter and was emitting a reddish-orange glow. The object was observed to maneuver at high speeds and to make abrupt changes in direction. There was no noise associated with the object.

INVESTIGATION:
An investigation was conducted by Colonel Holleman, USAF. Interviews were conducted with the airman who observed the object, as well as other personnel on duty at the time of the sighting. The airman's description of the object was consistent with the observations of the other personnel. No known aircraft were in the area at the time of the sighting.

CONCLUSION:
The investigating officer, Colonel Holleman, USAF, concluded that the object observed was an unidentified flying object. The object exhibited characteristics that could not be associated with any known aircraft or other conventional aerial vehicles.

Dear Dr. Fonnal: 

Your letter of 8 February followed up your telephone request to furnish a copy of the investigative report on the sighting of an unidentified object at your farm on 17 January. As you know, this report was prepared by Captain Philip W. Cabe, 8239th Air Force Reserve Squadron, who visited the site on 19 January. 

Captain Cabe's report, dated 22 January, states that at approximately 11:45 p.m. on 17 January, you and your wife observed a bright light in the sky about 20 degrees above the horizon in the southeast. The object was described as stationary, about the size of a car and brighter than the stars. After observing it for about 20 minutes, it suddenly accelerated, traveling in a horizontal path at a tremendous speed, and disappeared. No other witnesses were found in the immediate area.

If you are interested, please let me know and I will forward a copy of the complete report. The original is retained in our files.

Sincerely,

1. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS SUBMITTED CONCERNING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT OBSERVED ON 17 SEPTEMBER 1960 NEAR TEXARKANA, ARKANSAS:

AT APPROXIMATELY 2000 HOURS, 17 SEPTEMBER 1960, TWO USAF SECURITY POLICEMEN OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT MANEUVERING IN THE SKY OVER TEXARKANA, ARKANSAS. THE LIGHT WAS OBSERVED FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. IT APPEARED TO CHANGE COLOR FROM WHITE TO RED AND BACK TO WHITE. AT TIMES IT APPEARED TO HOVER, THEN ACCELERATE AND CHANGE DIRECTION RAPIDLY.

2. RADAR CONTACT WAS ESTABLISHED BY A USAF RADAR SITE AT LITTLE ROCK AIR FORCE BASE, ARKANSAS. THE OBJECT WAS TRACKED FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR AND 15 MINUTES. IT MOVED ERRATICALLY, CHANGING DIRECTION ABRUPTLY AND ACCELERATING RAPIDLY AT TIMES. SPEED VARIED FROM APPROXIMATELY 100 KNOTS TO OVER 1,000 KNOTS.

3. A USAF T-33 JET AIRCRAFT WAS SCRAMBLED FROM LITTLE ROCK AIR FORCE BASE TO INVESTIGATE. THE PILOT OBSERVED THE OBJECT VISUALLY AND WITH AIRBORNE RADAR. HE REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO CHANGE COLOR FROM WHITE TO RED AND BACK TO WHITE. IT MOVED ERRATICALLY AND ACCELERATED RAPIDLY AT TIMES.

4. BASED ON THE ABOVE INFORMATION, THIS UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED AS ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT OR PHENOMENON. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS CONTINUING.

31. Describe completed information.
35. Information which you feel questions and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire.
I have a feeling, or rather a kind of impression of some kind, regarding the phenomenon, no solid or definite views, just a vaguely wondering over the possibilities. The observations were rather similar to previous reports of sightings, namely:
Appearance was bright, high speed, no wings or other structure visible, just a bright light. Movements erratic, fast, abrupt changes of direction and altitude, no sound. Seemed intelligently controlled, not like a natural object.
Observed for a rather short time, perhaps a minute or less, through a window. Distance could not be estimated accurately. Size was difficult to judge, but appeared no larger than a star, perhaps a little larger. Weather was clear, no clouds or haze. Other persons may have seen the same or similar objects at the same time, but I have no knowledge of this. Have heard of other reports in the general area, but do not know the details. No further data or clues which could be used to identify the object or its source. I have no special knowledge or qualifications which would enable me to analyze or interpret the observations. I have no theories or opinions to offer, other than the vague impression it was some kind of intelligently controlled device or craft, not a natural phenomena. That is about all I can say with reasonable confidence about the observations.

A time indicator then began to move away for me. The object was close enough to make out the details of the surface and texture. It was pale blue greyish color and was shaped like a flat-topped round object about 30 minutes in diameter. On the surface were lights that seem to be portholes or some kind of openings. The object then started moving slowly to the right and dipped below some trees in the distance. I had not heard any sound from the object at any time.

REPORTED OVER ARKANSAS
INVESTIGATING OFFICER: CAPT E.J. RUPPELT
CLASS IV - SPECIAL REPORT
FACTS OF THE CASE:
ON 8 OCTOBER 1960, CAPT E.J. RUPPELT RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM CAPT. A.A. NEWTON OF LITTLE ROCK AFB, ARKANSAS, REGARDING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORTED BY SEVERAL RELIABLE WITNESSES IN THE ARKANSAS AREA.
DETAILS OF SIGHTING.
AT 1947 CST, SEVERAL CITIZENS REPORTED OBSERVING A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE WESTERN SKY. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING IN ONE POSITION FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. IT THEN BEGAN MOVING IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION, ACCELERATING RAPIDLY AND DISAPPEARING FROM SIGHT. THE LIGHT WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING EXTREMELY BRIGHT, MUCH BRIGHTER THAN SURROUNDING STARS. IT LEFT NO TRAIL OR EXHAUST VISIBLE TO THE OBSERVERS.
INVESTIGATION
AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION WAS LAUNCHED BY CAPT. NEWTON. HE INTERVIEWED SEVERAL OF THE WITNESSES, ALL OF WHOM GAVE CONSISTENT ACCOUNTS OF THE SIGHTING. THE WITNESSES WERE DEEMED TO BE RELIABLE AND CREDIBLE. CAPT. NEWTON CONDUCTED BACKGROUND CHECKS ON THE WITNESSES AND FOUND THEM TO BE UPSTANDING MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WITH NO KNOWN TENDENCIES TOWARD FABRICATION OR EXAGGERATION. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, WITH EXCELLENT VISIBILITY.
CONCLUSION
BASED ON THE CONSISTENT WITNESS ACCOUNTS AND THE CREDIBILITY OF THE OBSERVERS, CAPT. NEWTON CONCLUDED THAT THE SIGHTING WAS OF A GENUINE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. HE REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO CAPT. RUPPELT AT PROJECT BLUE BOOK FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS.

It appears to be a page from a report, likely from Project Blue Book, that describes an observation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in Arkansas on October 19, 1960. The text indicates that a group of disc-shaped objects were sighted in the sky and that the UFO was undulating as it rotated around its axis, and the objects' positioning constantly changed in relation to each other.

Altus, Oklahoma

The AF-48 report was worried over the sighting. The sighting took place at approximately 8:30 PM on November 12, 1949. The witness, a flight officer stationed at Altus Air Force Base, was proceeding on a routine flight check in a B-25 aircraft when he observed a bright light in the sky near the airfield. The light appeared to be in a stationary position and was observed for approximately five minutes. It was described as a bright, glowing object, somewhat oval in shape. The witness stated that at one point the object appeared to split into two parts, but quickly rejoined again. The object then accelerated at a rapid rate and disappeared from sight. The pilot reported the sighting to the base operations office immediately upon landing.

No Case Information Only) 16 November 1950
Wichita Falls, Texas

The Air Force has received reports over the Panhandle of a bright red
object that appeared to be hovering over the West Texas area briefly.
According to reports received from several sources, some objects were
observed on 16 November 1950, a bright glowing object was sighted in
the sky over the Wichita Falls area for a short period of time.
However, no physical evidence or further data has been received
to substantiate this sighting.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a text description of a "Venus-Jupiter Conjunction" that occurred on November 12, 1960. The text describes the event as involving two bright objects, perhaps stars or planets, that were visible in the sky at that time.

VENUS-JUPITER CONJUNCTION
On the evening of November 12, 1960, I
was able to observe the conjunction of Venus and
Jupiter. This conjunction was extremely close and
the two bright objects were very close together in the
sky. Venus was on the left and Jupiter was on the
right. The two objects were so close together that
they almost appeared as one object. The conjunction
was observed for several minutes and their position
did not change appreciably over the time the
observation was made.

"Sunday, November 26, 1961

Captain Charles L. May
R.F.D. No. 1
Box 52
Springdale, Arkansas  

Dear Sir:

My name is [REDACTED] and I am 17 years old, and I was reading over your letter that would help me out of a jam, and I want to express my appreciation to you, because I believe you understand my problem perfectly.

One November day last year, just before a large search was made, (it was going on at the time) I looked up and saw "one is not that beautiful." This object is indistinct, and looked up and said "one is not that beautiful." As I looked closer at this object, it seemed to be a perfectly round object. This object lasted for quite a while, and I became more and more puzzled at what this object was. My friends were with me and they saw the same thing that I saw. They did not know what it was, neither did I.

[REDACTED], as we stand here, we will explain, for I know you will understand, because you have studied these things. As we stood there, we were amazed at the object. It seemed to be hovering there. It was about the size of a quarter, and then it started moving. It moved rapidly, and then it just winked out and disappeared. We stood there somewhat in awe, because we did not know what to think about it. 

As we both were very scared, so to speak, and told each other that we were dreaming. This happened about 6:30 in the evening. We both rushed home and told our families, and they said we were only dreaming. But my parents were upset, because they know I would not lie, because I am always honest with them. 

We talked it over for a few days, and then it seemed to leave our mind. But my parents were not satisfied, and they called the sheriff's office, and they came out but found nothing. The next day the Air Force was called in, but they found nothing. This went on for about 3 days, and then it was dropped.

As we both were very shaken up by this, I would like for you to write me and tell me what you think about this. I am very interested in your opinion, because I know you have studied these things, and I believe you can give me some answers.

Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]"

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing the sighting of an unidentified object. The text in the document is as follows:

About two months ago it doesn't make any difference when it was. It was shout a quarter past seven in the evening and I had just finished supper and was sitting in my living room reading a magazine. I noticed out of the corner of my eye a bright light out by the clothesline in the back yard. I went to the back door to investigate and saw what appeared to be a round object about fifty yards from the house hovering about thirty feet off the ground. It was about the size of a basketball. The object was perfectly round and was glowing a bright orange color. After watching it hover for about a minute, it suddenly shot straight up into the sky and disappeared from sight in about three seconds. The whole incident lasted only about a minute and a half.

I called the Air Force the next day and reported the incident. The Air Force sent out an investigator to interview me a few days later. He seemed very interested in the incident and asked me many questions about what I had seen. He said the report would be forwarded to Project Blue Book for further investigation. That's the last I've heard about it.

Description of Object Seen:
1. No noise from object.
2. It came straight down from the direction it came from.
3. Varied from about 3 to 4 feet in diameter in the first sighting.
4. Had definite edges or edges to it.
5. No sound.
6. Hovered for about a minute and then shot straight up.
7. Had the capability for any direction...

Dear Sir: It is our hope that you took into this and assume we a forced explanation for these sightings. The thought of the unknown and what it could mean is fascinating, and it is our purpose to be as objective as possible about sighting like this one.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed document that appears to be a UFO report from Project Blue Book. I have extracted and transcribed the text from the document below:

The reasons that the witnesses have for this sighting are quite unusual. They would have seen things like these if what they have reported is true. I am sure you would want me to press them to give more details and to press any friend to press that those sightings were really what they say they were.

Particularly significant is that maybe you have heard of such sightings, and could be able to ascertain the facts by telling us how reliable the observers are. We would all be grateful to have an explanation that you might suggest that would account for this unusual incident.

We would all be gratified to have some explanation that you might supply that would account for this unusual incident.

Very truly yours,
(Redacted)

GROUND METEOR IN 1958 
Since the discovery of the origin of the strange objects that have appeared over 1,200 accounts in various parts of the country during the past 20 months, I have prepared over 100 diagrams and photographs with their descriptions, and I now have those 'photographs ready which were exposed on October 20, 21, 1959 and show precisely what the objects of the Oregon Meteor were between the times of 2:30 and 2:46 a.m., Pacific Standard Time.

On October 20, 1959 one of the objects which crossed the sky over Southern California, was seen by myself and two friends of mine. We took 7 photographs of this object with their descriptions, and I now have ready the first two of these photographs which show this particular object very clearly.

An extraord inary meteor of great magnitude
appeared over sou thcm California on 
October 20, 1959 and was observed and 
photographed by Norman D. Perrott s of
5417 Fountain St., Los Angoles, California.

23 October 1960
over Toledo, Ohio

No Case (Information Only)

The observer, a man who was visiting friends in the Toledo, Ohio area, reported observing an object that appeared to be a sphere, or globe-like in shape, traveling at a high rate of speed over Toledo at approximately 7:00 p.m. on 23 October 1960. The object was described as emitting a bright light, which appeared to flash or blink at intervals. The object was observed for several minutes before disappearing from view.

The observer stated that he had no idea as to the identity or the origin of the object, and was unable to offer any explanation for what he had observed. No other witnesses were reported.

SUBJ: INFORMATION FOR PROJECT FILE 
TYPED: 16 FEB 61
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
T_CARD NO: 55 Incident reported 13 November 1960, and forwarded 1 December 1960. A signature of one of the principals involved in this UFO sighting was made to ARC or other of the witnesses mentioned by number.

2. The information contained in the newspaper account of the sighting called for an on-the-ground investigation. The newspaper indicated that two independent witnesses had reported the incident, and on-the-spot investigation seemed justified.

3. The account by [REDACTED] indicates that 21 October 1960 was during the early phases of the 1960 satellite launching activity. As was the case in many similar incidents reported by Aerospace Defense Command, some of the sightings were likely attributable to satellite launchings at that time.
 
4. it was not possible to obtain any reliable data. This conclusion is based on the distance of the sightings to the witnesses, the brief time the objects were visible, and the absence of corroborative data.
