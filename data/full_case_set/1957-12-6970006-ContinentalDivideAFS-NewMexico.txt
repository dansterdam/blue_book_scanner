(11) THIS REPORT PREPARED BY COMMANDER AND OPERATIONS OFFICER. THERE IS NO POSITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CAUSE OF THESE SIGHTINGS. OBSERVERS WILL NOT DEFINITELY IDENTIFY OBJECTS AS METEORS AND WILL NOT POSITIVELY DISCOUNT SUCH AN EXPLANATION. IT IS OBVIOUS HOWEVER, THAT THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THIS EXPLANATION. STATEMENTS ARE ALL CONSISTANT WITH EXCEPTION OF THAT OF AMN VEYLUPEK. HIS STORY IS AT VARIANCE ON SEVERAL POINTS. ALL AGREE, HOWEVER THAT THERE WAS A LARGE NUMBER OF OBJECTS, AND THAT THEY DEFINITELY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING TO COMPARE WITH THEM. THE FACT THAT EACH OBJECT WAS IN LEVEL FLIGHT AND WAS VISIBLE FOR THREE TO FIVE SECONDS IS A MATTER OF CONSISTANT TESTIMONY. THE COMPLETELY REFUTE THE POSSIBILITY OF MIS-IDENTIFYING AIRCRAFT AS UFOR'S
