FOUR RELIABLE WITNESSES, ONE FROM EACH OF THE LOCATIONS MENTIONED

PAGE THREE PJJFBA 31
IN PARAGRAPH E ABOVE, WERE SELECTED AND QUESTIONED IN DETAIL PERSONALLY BY THE INVESTIGATION OFFICER ON THE EXACT SPOT THE OBSERVER WAS
STANDING AND AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME OF DAY THAT THE SIGHTING
OCCURRED. AN HOURS FOLLOWING THE DAY OF THE SIGHTING, THE OBSERVER
AT LAS CRUCES WAS THE ONLY OBSERVER THAT REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT
STOOD STILL OR HOVERED. IN THE OPINION OF THE INVESTIGATION
OFFICER, THIS CAN BE LOGICALLY EXPLAINED BY THE OPTICAL ILLUSION
CREATED BY THE RELATIVE MOTION OF THE UFO AND STATIONERY OBJECTS

TEXT OUTPUT:

IN THE FOREGROUND DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE 
FROM A MANEUVERING VEHICLE. ALTHOUGH IN MOST CASES THE OBSERVERS 
WERE CONVINCED THAT THE OBJECT WAS VERY CLOSE, IT IS THE OPINION OF 
THE INVESTIGATION OFFICER THAT THE OBJECT WAS AT A SUBSTANTIALLY
GREATER DISTANCE FROM THE OBSERVERS THAN THEY SUSPECTED... AND 
THEREFORE AT A GREATER ALTITUDE AND TRAVELING AT A GREATER SPEED.
THIS IS INDICATED BY THE FOLLOWING FACTS: WITHOUT EXCEPTION, THOSE
OBSERVERS PERSONALLY INTERVIEWED ON THE EXACT LOCATION OF THEIR 
OBSERVATIONS, POINTED IN THE DIRECTION AT WHICH THEY FIRST OBSERVED
THE OBJECT AND IT WAS 10 TO 15 DEGREES TO THE LEFT OF THE NORTH
STAR. THE OBSERVERS INTERVIEWED WERE AT LOCATION OVER A SPAN OF
APPROXIMATELY 55 NAUTICAL MILES BETWEEN ALAMOGORDO AND LAS CRUCES
