The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically an "EXTRACT FROM STATUS REPORT" dated 25 May 52 and describing an incident observed with a radar near Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico. The report provides details such as the time, location, length of observation, speed, altitude, heading, and source of the observation, which was a radar system. The description of the incident states that the object was "Observed with GP-5 radar" and "appeared on scope as three fires on two radar scopes."

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT, TIERRA AMARILLO, NEW MEXICO 

TO: CHIEF, AIR INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

ON 24 MAY 1952 WHILE ON A DUTY RUN, A PILOT OF THIS COMMAND (MISSING FROM SUBJECT) WAS PROCEEDING IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION FROM SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, TO LUBBOCK, TEXAS. AT 4,000 FEET ALTITUDE, AND APPROXIMATELY 45 MILES SOUTH OF AMARILLO, TEXAS, HE SIGHTED AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT TRAVELLING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION AT HIGH SPEED ESTIMATED TO BE 600 TO 1,000 MILES PER HOUR. THE OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, AND YELLOW IN COLOR. HE LOST SIGHT OF IT AS IT DISAPPEARED OVER THE HORIZON. CREW WAS UNABLE TO MAKE ANY POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT. THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THIS HEADQUARTERS. THE ORIGINAL DETECTION OF THIS TARGET ON THE 29 MAY 1952 AT 0345 DEG. AT 6l MILES FOLLOWED BY THE THREE SWEEP CONTACTS.

I CONTACTED MAJ. C AT 15 DEC 52, THIS DATE, AND OBTAINED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THIS EVENT. I NOW HAVE A COMPLETE SUMMARY OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF THIS TARGET AND BELIEVE IT WARRANTS FURTHER SCRUTINY AS BEING A POSSIBLE UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT. AT THIS TIME I NOTIFIED THE CONTROLLER OF THIS POSITION AND RECOMMENDED THAT THIS DATA BE GIVEN TO PROPER AUTHORITIES FOR FURTHER ACTION. THIS WAS THE LAST POINT DETECTED ON THIS TARGET.

SUBJECT: UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE REPORT

TO: DIR ADO) ATTENTION: Director of Intelligence

AS 16200 on 25 MAY 1952 I was on duty as Asst DCO at this control and warning station. About 11:20 PM a weather radar contact was made at approximately 140 miles SE of station on a heading of 290Â° (T). This contact was tracked on radar for approximately 3 minutes, during which time it maintained a constant speed of approximately 700 mph. It then disappeared from the scope. This target was not plotted as known air traffic at this time and it is requested that all available information concerning this incident be forwarded to this organization for further study and records. Nothing further was seen of this target. I am informing the controller: This target did not paint again.
