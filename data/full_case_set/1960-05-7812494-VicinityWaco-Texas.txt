2. LOCATION: Vicinity Waco, Texas
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local 1000222 May 60
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: Yes
6. SOURCE: Civilian
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 1-2 sec
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
9. COURSE: E to N
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Object, no wings or tail visible, appeared to be approx 20 times as large as a B-57, traveling at dusk. Color not determined due to sun reflecting off object. Haze layer present. Witness held jet and looked up just in time to see object.
11. COMMENTS: This report is classified as insufficient data. The object was possibly an A/C, although none were reported in the area a witness claimed to hear sound of jet. Any object 20 times the size of a B-57 would have been witnessed by others over a city. The insufficient data rendered evaluation inconclusive.
12. CONCLUSIONS: Was unknown. Possibly Balloon, Probably Balloon, Possibly Aircraft, Probably Aircraft, Was Astronomical, Possibly Astronomical, Insufficient Data for Evaluation.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Vicinity Waco, Texas
Date: 10 May 1960
WX: Clear, vis 15-20 mi in light haze, winds N & NW at 5 to 15 knots
Description: Long-possibly pointed like rail pt pen, size 20 times as large as a B-17, heard jet soft and looked up, first seen at 315 deg elev unk, disapp 025 deg elev unk, fit path to E, made 90 deg turn to N with no apparent change in direction of flight, disapp due to loss of eye focus, seen for 4 seconds
Direction of Motion: East, then North
Satellite: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219) Ruled out
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): Ruled out due to the reported maneuver
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1): None
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc): Ruled out
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: Pass left; however, the reporting officer stated that there were no known acft in the area
Other: Insufficient Data (1 witness)
Evaluation of Source Reliability: 
Analysis and Conclusions: The witness said that he heard a jet soft, yet the reporting officer stated that there were no known acft in the area. The witness could not determine the color due to the sun reflections, and reported that it was as large as 20 times a B-17. This report is evaluated as insufficient data.
