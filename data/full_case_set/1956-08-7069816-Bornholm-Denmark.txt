OUTPUT OF OCR:

Bornholm Case (AW Base). The "electrification-temperature inversion" appears to be the electrical reaction of the OBECT with USAF was considered appropriate, considering the limited information.

The Bornholm Case.

There is inconsistent track data starting to accumulate on the matter of the track-whether it is certain, changing speed and direction rapidly, or whether the race characteristics are smooth, although speed spread appears considerable.

The distance to Picking up was from 15 to 20 identified object not larger than most commercial aircraft, but were appearing and disappearing rapidly. They were appearing true to the Azimuth "quick look" even though the objects were there one moment and very rapidly disappearing to re-appear, the next instant, at a different location. This indicates the presence of a track but with characteristics that are a bit confused.

It is the other sightings, it is not possible to make a thorough evaluation without scope, while more complete data with all possible information would be highly desirable.

RECOMMENDATION : In view of the other sightings, it is not possible to make a thorough evaluation without more complete data with all possible information would be highly desirable.

The text in the document is as follows:

"There is good reason to believe that a dark cloud or spherical shape ascended rapidly from the ground at the sighting location. Whether it was a solid, disc-shaped object or merely an atmospheric phenomenon is not certain from those observations which were made at the time. The reference to 'picking up to 3 to 5 unidentified objects' at the peak intensity of 10:25 PM indicates that these objects, whatever their nature, were displaying unusual motion and speed. It is also possible that more complete information research and analysis might lead to a more definitive conclusion as to the exact nature of the phenomena observed on that occasion."

PART I: Information submitted on UFO limited and incomplete upon which to make proper evaluation or to arrive at some firm conclusion or determination regarding origin or nature of radar sighting. More thorough analysis would require such information as type of radar equipment, calibration, operating frequency, range, beam width, accuracy and quality of recordings, bearing determination accuracy, etc. Also temperature inversions, population, lapse rate, accurate tabulation of related weather data.

PART II: The type of information cited above can indicate whether objects observed solid or due to unusual weather conditions i.e. anomalous propagation. Examples: number of blips appearing and disappearing intermittently, are characteristic of weather/temperature on radar. Unusual weather conditions may also influence electronic equipment.

explain observed erratic movements and tremendous speeds of supposed solid target. 
Temperature inversions can cause radar beam projected upward to bend down and pick
up objects on the ground, appearing as objects in the air. Other strong evi-
dences of weather return is disappearance of all targets simultaneously. Under
certain conditions, inversion layers can cause interference between two radar sta-
tions some distance apart. Interference can be checked by changing frequency 20 to
40 megacycles, if settings can be varied. All can often be confusing to trained,
experienced radar operators.

PARA III: Specifically, track data submitted insufficient to determine nature of
tracks whether erratic, rapidly changing speed and direction (as is usual in most
sightings of this nature), or whether acceleration patterns and course changes are
smooth. Reference to picking up "3 to 5 unidentified objects at 0830 2" at least
infers that targets not steady, but appearing and disappearing. If true, targets
observed are somewhat similar in manner to unidentified central England sightings,

2. The existence of several orbiting objects in the air at the same time does not exclude the possibility of guided missiles, but does not conform to addition that could be conclusion for guided missiles in this country.

MEMORANDUM FOR COL JOHNSON AND COL GREEN
SUBJECT: Bornholm Radar UFO Sighting

Gen 2-12-9-90 USARRY, informed me that a recent visit was made to Denmark to verify the status of an unidentified object tracked on the Bornholm radar site. The limited information submitted is that these objects which present a well defined size of high intelligence on the radar scope, were the result of a detailed and exhaustive investigation by informed sources. The reports of sightings and radar tracking was confirmed, but no cau se of conventional propulsion could be ascertained.

AFCIN's evaluation is that the existence of several artificial satellites being guided missile, none of which could account for the characteristics of observed phenomena, does not exclude the possibility of guided missiles or other Air Force devices, this particular incident would appear to remain unexplained.

It is requested that the Bornholm Radar UFO incidents be followed up with view to arriving at a more firm conclusion.

I could appreciate it if the above information is submitted to Gen Cabell for his consideration.

Colonel, USAF.
