AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

The text in the document is as follows:

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS SIGHTED NEAR ERDING AIR DEPOT, GERMANY
DATE OF INCIDENT: 29 OCTOBER 1952
PLACE: ERDING AIR DEPOT, NEAR MUNICH, GERMANY
PREPARED BY: F. RINDGE, CAPTAIN, USAF
SUMMARY: MCD 5224, dated 30 October 1952.

The following information pertains to the sighting of an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of the Erding Air Depot, Germany, on 29 October 1952.

At approximately 0750 hours local time (Central European) on Wednesday, 29 October 1952, a soldier on guard duty at the operations building, Erding Air Depot, observed an unidentified flying object in the sky to the southwest of the depot. It was first sighted approaching from a distance and then passed overhead, continuing in a northeasterly direction.

The object appeared to be circular in shape, metallic in color, and was estimated to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. It was silently traveling at a speed estimated to be between 400 and 500 miles per hour at an altitude estimated to be between 6,000 and 7,500 feet.

The object was observed for a period of approximately 30 seconds. During the time it was under observation, no sound or exhaust was detected, and there was no evidence of any trail or vapor stream.

A check by the Operations Officer on duty at the radar site at the time of observation met with negative results.

Weather conditions at the time of sighting were as follows: Winds at 5,000 feet - 260 degrees at 25 knots; temperature - plus 5 degrees Celsius; visibility - 10 miles.

Statements:
1. Weather station - 3/8 to 1/4 sky cover - no precipitation.
2. Operations building - 3/8 to 1/4 sky cover - no precipitation.

STATEMENT

At approximately 0750 hours on the morning of October 29, 1952, a white disc-like object was observed descending behind the Erding Bowling Alley accompanied by a distinct whistling sound. The object appeared to hover approximately 15 feet above the ground for about 30 seconds, then ascend rapidly in a vertical direction. While pointing at the object, it disappeared from sight. At first glance the object appeared to be circular or disc-shaped, and was observed by two witnesses at the scene.
The object was in sight approximately 20 seconds until it disappeared from our immediate view. Behind the bowling alley and through several buildings the object became visible again for about 20 seconds. To the horizon, no sound was heard at any time from the object. The object then disappeared, giving no indication as to where it went or how it left.
The object seemed to slide or glide smoothly through the air at constant speed or velocity. It could not be observed on the object and it seemed to be formed in a mass or solid form. I could not discern the exact details of the object, but it appeared to disappear against the background of the sky.

29 OCTOBER 1952

STATEMENT

At approximately 0730 hours on the 29th of October, while walking west toward the Erding Bowling Alley, accompanied by 3 3/4 officers, I sighted an object in the sky. The attention was called to this object by 2 USAF pilots who were parking their cars. The object was round and appeared to be silver in color. It was hovering and moved in any direction at a very fast pace and said "It isn't any conventional type aircraft".

This object was in sight for approximately 20 to 30 seconds and then disappeared from our view behind the bowling alley. The speed of the object was so fast that it seemed to disappear in a matter of seconds. It passed from a northwesterly course and maintained a level altitude. It appeared to be about the size of a small automobile. It seemed to
glide through the air at a constant speed. I could not distinguish any wings or propellers. It appeared to have a silvery color.

At no time during the sighting was any sound heard.
