Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

I am enclosing a toasted copy of a APRO bulletin. Please notice that the Holloman Air Force Base case. This is the sort of case which prompted me to write and tell you very recently that there appeared to be a case of the bomber pilot and the tower which the radio amateur accidentally picked up while operating his receiver sometime ago. As you will note, this case took place at this late date, but at the very least, the radio amateur and the equipment should be considered as having been the original stimulants at the time.

I am also enclosing a toasted copy of a note from Mr. English. He is a radio amateur who has become interested in the case and may ask you to get some pictures made of the terrain area and so on.

Reference is made to APR-11, 200 miles east of Dover (Agentia): would you please consider having this case thoroughly investigated. While it is true that they reportedly saw an "object", we may be able to make an analysis and find that it could have been one of the many well-known objects which they were observing and passed since everything over that area is tracked and recorded. It should be brought to your attention that bright the object appeared and also whether they ever saw it to the same site.

Last Sunday I took occasion while listening around to call this German amateur, Mr. Steffen Manaheim, in Harrisonburg, Virginia. This is because I wanted to get straight facts on the two points. One was how he tracked the object and the other was exactly how the object was seen by his naked eye. Games seem to be completely closed hill of health which the counter wave was used in. They were keeping such a tight frequency for a search encounter that I believe they could say categorically, that there were no traces of anything.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

"Project Blue Book Special Report
Subject: "Unidentified Flying Objects"
Dear Sir:
It has recently come to our attention that you may have observed unusual objects in the sky. We have had many reports of similar sightings and have made extensive inquiries regarding many of our observations. We are in the ninth year of this project.
Observations on 17 August 1964
It was about 1:25 AM on 17 August 1964, when two witnesses sighted a bright light which seemed to move erratically above the horizon in the northeast. The object was observed for several minutes and then disappeared below the horizon.
The witnesses describe the object as a bright light, much brighter than any stars or planets in the sky at the time. It was observed to make sudden movements, stopping, starting, and changing direction rapidly. No sound was heard from the object.
We have received a number of similar reports, and these observations seem to be of interest to answer any questions you may have about them."

This is to advise you that, to date, no report of any kind has come to the
attention of this office concerning the apparent UFO observation occurring
near Ravenna, Ohio, on or about 22 August 1964. If any information pertaining
to this incident has been forwarded to your office by the United States Air
Force, I would very much appreciate being advised of the details in order that
our files may be properly documented. It is my understanding that Project Blue
Book was to conduct an investigation of the case, and I would be interested

It is indicated a date of July 2, 1963, as the time of your first observation. It appears that the satellite you observed was not one that we have recorded in our files, and it may be that you observed a satellite launched after that time. I regret that I cannot provide you with more definitive information concerning your observation.

For your information, both SAO and GSFC have made more precise observations of satellite orbits, and data is available for those satellites processed by these agencies.

Because of security classifications, I am unable to provide you with specific details on the satellite you observed. Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Dear Mr. -

This is in response to your recent letter to the President concerning information on several recent satellite observations. The President has asked that I reply to your letter.

You indicated a date of July 3,. 1963, as the date of your first sighting. The Air Force does not record of associate passage for more than one Eeho I or Echo II for that date. However, our records for July 3, 1964 do not indicate a passage of either Echo I or Echo II for that date. It may be that you observed a satellite or laser missile, or perhaps a high-flying aircraft on that date. We did not locate any definite report with the information you provided, and we are unable to make a firm determination of the nature of the light.

Both Echo I and Echo II made several passes over your area on the succeeding evenings of August 4th and August 17th, between 7:54 P.M. and 10:45 P.M. Because of atmospheric conditions, a satellite can give the appearance of blinking or flashing as it passes overhead in much the same way that a star twinkle.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

M.D. SAPILI:/ MT
SAPILI: 21 22 41 t/JM/

Dear Senator Keating:

This is in response to your inquiry in behalf of your constituent concerning unidentified flying objects (UFOB).

With regard to the truth to allegations that the Air Force has a secret documentation of its past studies of UFOBS, we must state categorically that this is not the case. The Air Force has made public all data and information concerning UFOB problems including negative case findings. There are no secret files or secret procedures which are also used in the evaluation of UFOB problems and reports.

The Air Force does not have the resources and facilities to make an exhaustive and conclusive investigation of every UFOB report. However, we do accept valid reports of UFOBS from reliable observers and analyze these in order to determine, if possible, the nature of the sighting. In addition, we maintain periodic contact with major news media and other interested parties in order to evaluate public attitudes and develop procedures which are designed to obtain more complete information in a timely manner.

The United States Air Force will continue to serve as the agency responsible for the receipt, initial investigation and analysis of UFOB reports in the United States. The services of qualified scientific personnel and periodic public officials will be utilized in this process.

Sincerely,

MAJ HARR

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed letter dated August 31, 1964 from Maston M. Jacks of the Office of Information to an unnamed recipient. The letter discusses the passage of both Echo I and Echo II satellites over the New Jersey-New York area on a recent evening, approximately 2 hours apart. It states that the Echo schedules are believed to be stable and consistent, allowing for observation of these satellites.

Text transcription:

August 31, 1964

Dear Sir:

This is in response to your letter of August 28, 1964. This was written in which you requested information concerning the passage of both Echo I and Echo II which passed over the New Jersey-New York area on a recent evening.

You witnessed the passage of both Echo I and Echo II satellites approximately 2 hours apart, and at other times you may first observe the passage of one and later the passage of the other.

It is believed that the Echo schedules are stable and consistent, allowing for observation of these satellites from the same locations just which may be overflight in certain time.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS

Dear Wendover's
I want to immediately the last three nights I have been seeing of ud in the sky. Others have seen it too. I was wondering ifyou could tell me more about it. My contact up there, as you know, have been keeping me some new. reports. I live in France, New Jersey and the last time I saw it was on May 21, 1964. The distance was 5:30 P.M. and 6:00 P.M. We were not observing star, but there something strange about the time because we are not able to see it and disappeared after some time. So, this happened one other time, and we have it many as five or six the same appearances. Any more information you can give me will be appreciated I am serious about this and I know you are too, so please let me know what you think.

LARSON AIR FORCE BASE, WASHINGTON

REPLY TO 
ATTN OP: BC

SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Object Activity 27 August 1964

TO: AFSC(FTD) 
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, 45433

1. On 21 August 1964, at 1600 local time, a call was received
at this installation from the police department of Moses Lake, 
Washington, reporting the Air Police of the discovery of what was 
to be the landing site of an Unidentified Flying Object. Lt Col 
S and Lt Col W, this unit, were dispatched to investigate in 
accordance with AFR 200-2.

2. A check with the Seattle Air Defense Sector, local Control 
Unit and ARTCC, showed no radar contact in the area at the time 
of the alleged UFO activity.

3. In an interview with Mrs. [ILLEGIBLE], of the 
following information was obtained:

"At 0156, 21 August 1964, Mrs. [ILLEGIBLE] was awakened
by a noise outside. She had set her alarm clock for 0600. She has
two sons, ages eight and six, she went to work. She then noticed 
strange lights in her yard, approximately four to six inches in 
diameter. These lights would turn on and off. They would move 
back and forth in her yard for three hours sometimes during the 
night. She then checked the house where the wind-type lamps they 
had showed it to actually be on and was immediately awakened up.
She turned the lights on and two dogs outside were also awakened. 
These dogs were acting strange, barking and looking up at the 
sky. At approximately 1030 hours that same morning the family 
went back to sleep. At approximately 1030 hours that same morn
ing, the sons and several of their friends were playing in the
field about 150 yards from the house when they found what appeared
to be the landing area. These irregular depressions, three in 
number, were about six inches wide and six inches deep. In the
center of these depressions was a crater approximately four and
one half feet in diameter and eight to ten inches deep.
diagram of this alleged landing spot is included in this report."

- page 59 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document.

Coming from the north western "tripod" depression were appeared to be footprints. There were forty-three of these, having in a westerly direction, in what appeared to be a "tripod" impression. Some of the returning footprints leading in the opposite direction were twenty-two inches long and eight inches wide, and approximately two inches deep.

Radiation tests and photographs were taken of the area and included in this report.

At 1800 on 21 August 1964, an extensive search of the area concerned was made. With the exception of the impressions noted in this report, no further evidence of unusual activity was discovered. Due to the presence of numerous signs and articles of the two horses pastured in the area, the impressions were deemed indistinguishable from the time the investigating officer had arrived on the scene.

The exact location of the reported activity is 47 07N, 119 10W. This places the area in question within walking distance of the Installation's limits.

Results of this investigation would indicate that persons unknown entered the area and departed without leaving any trace which would provide evidence as to the identity of the individuals responsible. The "tripod" effect can be duplicated by rotating in a manner similar to that of the shoes involved in this action. The "crater" depression can be duplicated by rotating and identicial depressions were achieved. The alarm systems customarily employed to detect any unauthorized or unusual activity existing at the installation were in operation during the period in question and indicated no evidence of intrusion. Based on the investigation conducted, it is the opinion of the undersigned that nothing of significance to the Air Force or any other agency occurred at this installation on 21 August 1964.

Lynn, Massachusetts, 10-20pm EDT, 22 August 1964 - No mention of whether the object was sighted by the observer or observers. No description of the object.

At 10:20 p.m., the witness observed what he described as a lighted object which appeared to fly or float out of sight at a fairly low altitude. The object was said to be half the size of the full moon and emitted a white light. The witness said it flew erratically and then apparently landed out of sight beyond a hill. This was not accompanied by any sound.

Special Evidence of Interest - Such statements or observations are called "special evidence" when they indicate a definite link to the investigation. In more than 2000 cases the Air Force has found no evidence to indicate that unidentified objects are sophisticated instruments of hostile origin. The great majority of cases are attributable to misinterpretation of natural phenomena or objects.

That both sightings could not have been caused by an aircraft.

UFO sightings, Massachusetts, 25 Aug 64

Hq USAF SAFOI Pb (Mrs Gaiser)
Wash D C 20330

1. We are in receipt of two unidentified flying object reports 
from Saugus, Massachusetts. One report is from Mr Edwin F Fowler, 
a NICAP member, who is a private citizen. The other report is from 
Mrs Annette Shea, a resident of the area.

Our evaluation, Massachusetts, 25 August 1964 - no information was presented in the sighting of two bright objects observed close to each other that this observation could be satisfactorily explained.

3. Regarding the sighting, the time motion sequence of the objects was not clearly indicated and times of movement were not given. Mr Fowler should be recontacted so that more details of the direction or turn, or speeds of the objects might be obtained to possibly explain the sighting as a known aircraft or some other natural phenomena. The Air Force should make an additional effort to determine the time motion sequence of the objects sighted.

4. Regarding the sighting, the object or objects were reportedly sighted for a short period, estimated as about 2-3 minutes but the association with the sighting of a ground observer for less than 1 minute is questionable. It is little scientific value without precise and confirmed sighting details of the object or objects.

5. The Air Force regards all reliable and credible visual sightings as legitimate and important observations and will make reasonable efforts to resolve such sightings. However, we have no other reports of this sighting and thus regard this report as being of low scientific value. Also, no physical evidence was recovered.

Dear Capt. Quintanilla:

I am hoping you furnish me with information on some things my family and I have made in recent weeks.
The objects we have seen appear to be silent and unusual, but upon closer examination we note that they are moving, and in the space distance.
It is impossible to estimate the altitute at which they are visible, because we have no idea of their size. As it grew,   the objects seem to be far away, but live never known stars to move, and if, indeed, they were as near as their brilliance at times would indicate, they would be flying at tremendous speed.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, describing a UFO sighting incident that occurred on August 29th.

LYNN, MASSACHUSETTS UFO SIGHTING - AUGUST 29, 1964

BACKGROUND:
On Saturday, August 29th, upon the return home from a business trip, the witness noticed a strange object in the sky. She called her husband to come outside and observe the object as well. They observed the object for some time until it eventually disappeared from view. The witness then called a friend of theirs who had also witnessed the object earlier that evening. The friend confirmed that he had seen the same strange object.

The document then goes on to describe the details of the witness's account, including the size, shape, and movements of the observed UFO. It mentions that the witness attempted to call the telephone company to identify the object, but this effort was unsuccessful.

The text does not appear to contain any sketch or photograph of the observed UFO.

- page 114 -

There is no photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book document.

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:
They went up on the hill later that week to investigate, but found nothing. 
I checked various establishments located around the area, but there is no mention of any photograph or image on this page.
The page contains text describing various details related to a UFO sighting, but does not include any visual elements.

OCR OUTPUT:
They went up on the hill later that week to investigate, but found nothing. 
SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:
I checked various establishments located around the area. Lyons hospital on the opposite side of the hill from my home, where my brother works, and a telephone operator told me that they had found no evidence that any sighting had taken place. The manager of the local radio station said that he had received no telephone calls or reports of any unusual activity that night and the night watchman at the telephone company told me that he had seen nothing to report.
SPECIAL ITEMS OF INTEREST:
1. The presence of an electrical tower station has attracted a lively controversy as to why they may have observed it.
2. The sighting of a similar UFO is an item of great interest among the neighbors and local officials, and some of them said it looked like a falling star. However, one witness observed it to make a 90 degree turn, which could not have been a meteor or satellite as he had at first suspected. (Since the UFO sighting, the observer agrees with the Air Force contention that the object could have been something more prosaic, like a reflection, but he is not sure of it).
CHARACTER OF WITNESS:
1. I get the immediate impression when I talked with him that he is telling the truth as he knows it. You could see that he was trying his best to give an honest account in his own words as he saw it.
2. My brother works with a supervisor friend who has had a similar approach character recollected.
AREA UFO CHECKPOINTS:
Hanscom AFB, Bedford, Mass. - Negative regarding satellites.
Smithsonian Astrophysical Institute - Satellites, Meteors, Balloons.
Sky Life Advertising Plans - I checked with the manager whom I have called and he says there were no weather balloons released with his permission on that night.

Transcription of the text in the document:

During the past few months I have received three different UFO reports which struck out at me somewhat vividly because of the detailed plots and description of the characters. The first was a "UFO(?)" this advertizing plot and description of characters was handed to me by a man named Richard P. watch, who, in his sketch of times given me by the pilot, saw approximately the advertising plot in this case going by at various stations as flight altitude was checked and I have found little resemblance to the actual facts.

If the times and flight path given me by the witness were correct, I would have had to believe that this object was travelling at a very high rate of speed about 3 minutes from the time it was first sighted until it disappeared. Richard watched the UFO however for about three minutes and the object shown in his sketch was clearly seen.

CONCLUSION: After examining the witness and checking out the approximate landing or near landing site personally, I do not think that this sighting or observation can be classified as an actual UFO. The such of the information, the descriptions, and the identification all tend to suggest that this sighting was of a conventional aircraft rather than an identified flying object. It was dusk when this was observed, as suggested by the witness and the details lead me to conclude that this sighting was of a conventional aircraft or some other identification. I am confident that this sighting was not that of an unidentified flying object.

1. We are in receipt of two unidentified flying object reports from witnesses in Littleton, Massachusetts. The reports describe objects which were observed on 25 August 1964. A reply requesting information has in the past resulted in inquiries as to the evaluation of these sightings.
2. Littleton, Massachusetts, 5:30PM EDT, 25 August 1964: - No definite shape or outline of observed object could be determined. The object appeared to be hovering and remaining stationary for periods of time, motion sequence of the object indicates that such action is not caused by an aircraft.
Regarding the sighting, the time of motion sequence of the object is not included. Objects having no value unless the duration is included. In addition, no basis was given for the estimate of speed, which may be as great as 100-500 mph. In addition, no basis was given for the estimate of speed, which may be as great as 100-500 mph.
3. Regarding the sighting of 'eta'. The time duration of the sighting is reported as 'without this' portion which appeared to be similar other than the description of the object being similar. Such incidents are often speed related have indicated by the observers, the duration of one minute does not include that portion which the observers were hovering. Also, no basis was given for the estimate of speed.
4. The Air Force regards all witnesses as credible and makes no differentiations as to the value of the witness. No astronomical or mechanical aspects are apparently in these sightings.

Text extracted from the document:

Logan, Massachusetts, 10:30pm EDT, 25 August 1954. No mention of photography - the object hovered momentarily, about four feet above the telephone wires, emitting a bright light and moving slowly. The witnesses are the hill - the remaining information indicates that the object was above the crest of the hill.

Supporting Evidence - the nurses or members of a sound area, may or may not be associated with the observation of this event. However, since no association can be established.

In conclusion, we repeat, no information presented indicates that both sighting should not have been caused by an aircraft. FOR THE COUNSELLER

SIGHTING ACCOUNTS

LITTLETON, MASSACHUSETTS UFO SIGHTING - AUGUST 2

BACKGROUND:
On Friday, August 28th at Sylvania, Waltham, Mass, a telephone call to the Research Laboratory was made by my interested in a sighting of a silvery Unidentified Object which had been reported to him by several witnesses. He had been informed earlier that day that a silvery UFO had been observed by some 7 or 8 witnesses in the Littleton, Mass. area. He requested that I interview these witnesses and obtain a first hand account.

WITNESS # 1:
Littleton, Mass.
Aug 15

Common by was climbing a ride home and was picked up on the road by them. He said that this morning at about 9:30 AM he and four other men were working on a construction job, when one of the men called his attention to a strange object in the sky. 
Common and gave chase in the car. The object was described as shaped like a flat saucer, silver or aluminum colored, approximately 30 ft in diameter with a pronounced rim around the edge. It appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly at an altitude of about 300 ft. The object had a writhing motion over the field about 1/2 mile from the men. After a minute or two, it suddenly shot away at a high rate of speed and disappeared.

[Handwritten text]
The object I saw was round and had a silver color. It was quite large and flew across the sky at a fast speed. I first noticed it in the southeast and it moved in a northwesterly direction. It appeared to be about 1,000 feet up in the air and was silent as it flew. I watched it for about 3 minutes before it disappeared from view. This is the best I can describe what I saw. I'm not sure what it was, but it did not appear to be any kind of aircraft I'm familiar with.

WITNESS # 4 (Independent)

BLOWN - was in his bedroom when he heard an automobile look to the east and saw there was a light, and the object itself came from the northeast and crossed in front of his house to the west. The boy said the "flying saucer" had come down and picked up a light and took it up again. 

The following is the description of the object:
The shape of the object was oval. The size of the object was that of a "football" or slightly larger. It had a very bright light, stationary, and was also compared with the interior dome light of a car. The object was hovering about 50 feet above the ground.

Copied from sketch on UFO Data Sheet
EVALUATION: After interviews and cross-checking the accounts, the interviewing officer indicated that they were wellmeaning sincere people who seemed to know what they were talking about, and felt that they had actually seen a UFO. The officer said that Littleton Police Station but they had received no UFO reports that officer was taken aware of at the time.

I feel that the size of the objects could have been smaller than described, for this and some differences in their descriptions of the object and its maneuvers, it will be difficult to assess the significance of this information that may be turned up as soon as I receive.

Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any photograph or image present in the document page provided. The page appears to contain only text, which I will extract and provide below.

Mr. Powers and said that in his opinion the objects described were merely advertising airplanes flashing lights for advertising purposes, and that the reports about the objects being observed did not reflect a bona fide sighting.

At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Richard Pratt, 17, of East Longmeadow, Mass., heard a whistling sound coming from the north, and after watching for a few minutes observed a silver disc-shaped object descending at a rapid rate behind trees or shrubs in his yard. The object appeared to be about 300 yards away and was seemingly about four feet above the hill. Pratt told the investigator that it appeared to be slowly descending behind the shrubbery.

Richard told Mr. Fowler that he went into the house and told his mother he was afraid. He decided to investigate, but his mother dissuaded him because she also was afraid. During the course of the investigation, the investigator contacted personnel at the Lennox Hill Nursing Home, which is located in the vicinity of Pratt's home, and they were unable to account for the sighting.

The investigator points out that an electrical Power Station is located behind the Lennox Hill Nursing Home. A similar light in the general area has been described by APRO member Walter Webb of Cambridge, Massachusetts, as an observation he had looked almost identical to the one Pratt had seen.

"PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT

SUBJECT: POSSIBLE UFO REPORT 
LOCATION: Biloxi Air Force Base, Texas
DATE: 27 Feb 64

PURPOSE: This report covers a sighting from Major Quintanilla, the photography containing images which might possibly be UFO's. 

INVESTIGATION: An investigation was made of the photographic negatives submitted. The following was found:

1) There are 2 color slides, each 4 x 6 inches, approximately. The subjects appear to be ground formations known as "puddles" or "ponds". There is no evidence of any structure or object that could be considered a UFO.

2) The quality of the photography was poor, with blurry definition. It was evident that the subjects were distant and that the photographs were made under unfavorable conditions.

ANALYSIS: Due to the poor quality of the photography and the nature of the subjects, which appear to be natural ground formations, it is the opinion that these photographs do not contain evidence of any unusual or unidentified aerial phenomena.

RECOMMENDATIONS: It is recommended that this case be classified as "No evidence of UFO" and the photographic materials be returned to Major Quintanilla.

Unclassified Intelligence Center
Project Blue Book
Gentlemen:

8-20 August 29, 1964  A.F. 24:3 a.m.  I witnessed what appeared to be a large, brilliant, orange light in the western sky. It was located approximately 15 degrees above the horizon. The object remained stationary for approximately 5 minutes, then began to move slowly towards the northeast at a very slow speed. After traveling approximately 10 degrees, it began to accelerate rapidly and within several seconds had disappeared from sight. During the period it was visible, it emitted no sound and the light intensity remained constant.

This report is forwarded for your information and further evaluation as you deem appropriate.

ASTRONOMY

Saturn Now Prominent

Dense, directly overhead, is one of four bright stars visible this month, and the planet Saturn, Mars, Venus and Mercury are the other three. By JAMES STOKLEY
THE PLANET SATURN is now shining brightly in the southern skies, making it easy to identify. It is visible in the evening, soon after darkness falls, and can be seen for several hours. Charts accompanying maps show its location to the southeast of some well-known stars.
This is the time of year when Saturn appears directly overhead, not far from the celestial equator. Since it is now at opposition, meaning it is on the opposite side of the earth from the sun, it is visible most of the night. Saturn now stands well above the horizon both at sunset and at sunrise. In fact, it will be with us for the rest of the year - although it may be difficult to see it clearly because of the late autumn and winter haze near the horizon.
The light from Saturn now appears very bright, since the planet is closer to the earth than it has been since June, 1952. At that time Saturn was about 745 million miles away. On Aug. 22 it will be 793 million miles out. That's still a long distance, but Saturn is much more prominent in the sky than it has been in a long time.
On Aug. 22, at 8:17 p.m. EDT, the sun will be setting, twilight will have faded, and Saturn will shine with steady brilliance, high in the southern sky. The planets Jupiter, Venus and Mars will also be visible, marking the beginning of autumn in the sky, as indicated in the Celestial Time Table. But the standout of the evening sky will be Saturn, the ringed planet shining brightly, one of the most beautiful objects in the heavens.

HAIR PROTECTOR, useful for underwater filming, eliminates the problem of water-curled hair. By means of a simple clamp, a thin plastic film is stretched over the hair before diving or swimming to keep the hair in place.

LEADING . . . Many persons complain of early marital adjustment, but marriage counselors insist that much of the trouble is due to communication's failing. A husband or wife should not have to hint or guess at a problem - if one exists, they should freely discuss it with the spouse. Learning to openly discuss problems is getting more of a control of her conduct, according to Dr. John E. Smith, Richard I. Rosen.

THIS WAS ECHO?

The night before all the excitement of August 17, Mrs. Robert Smith of 530 N. Oris had retired around 10:00 P.M. The next morning, Aug 17, around 8:00 A.M. she had put her son to bed.

The son then went to his grandmother's house. She then went to her back door to look over her back yard. She noticed a shiny object in the sky, and said it passed under the last star she had noticed. It went slowly at first and then picked up speed and disappeared above the trees beyond. It turned out to be a large, shiny object, and was fairly large. She said her son had seen it too. This was around 9:00 A.M.

The Telegraph of Painesville, asked the Smith family for details and information about the sighting, and they were willing to cooperate.

The observers heard no sound, no other lights seen, and the object left no trail.

Observers: Mrs. Robert Smith, Robert L. and Thomas, 14 year old.

Duration: 7 min. for Mrs. Smith, 3-5 min. for Robert and Thomas.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Mr. Chardron, Ohio - August 17, 1954, 4:00-6:00 A.M.
Mr. Chardron (name from citizen) and a civil defense volunteer witnessed an object, possibly the same object, from outside the police station on the bottom of the hill about 1 1/2 mile from city limits for about 15-20 minutes. He said it hovered from 4:00-4:30 A.M. and appeared to be metallic. He said, but "couldn't figure out what it was".

Mr. Farmer, and said that without his binoculars (Mr. Young's), he could not have seen it as well. With the binoculars he said it appeared to have "light-bulb-like" surfaces. It was about 1,000 feet up, he saw two objects, one larger and one smaller, circling each other. The larger object disappeared completely for about 10-15 minutes. Yet, no sound was heard. No trails of smoke or vapor were noted. Mr. Farmer said the object had risen to a higher angle of elevation. Mr. Traiman wore.

Summation: Only one object of large size, which might be the planet Venus, observed at approximately 4:30 A.M. during the time of observation. No trails, no sound, higher angle of elevation.

Editorial Comments:
It is still only one bright object seen in the eastern sky at 4:30-6:00 with the sunrise. No dark object was seen where the bright object was observed previously. The Farmer's object could have been Venus. The U.F.O. object could have been Venus.

Summation: Large bright object was the planet Venus. Atmospheric conditions contributed to some of the effects, making the light appear to be objects moving.

Editorial Comments:
Sighting: Lake's Tracking Center blackholed the whole sighting with Rofo I, without adequate knowledge.
The newspapers: The Telegraph and the following "paper."

WAS IT VENUS?

On the morning hours of August 17, several law enforcement officers in the vicinity of the lat-ter-two counties, southeast of Johnson City, Tennessee, observed a strange phenomena. Radio-communications carried the news, and small aggregations of citizens gathered at different points to observe the strange phenomena.

As Captain Candues, of USIC, and Capt. Davis, of MUS, of McMinnville, Tennessee, the same night of the sightings, informed Capt. Patrick, guard at the Yacht Club docks, showed up the viewing of a strange flying object.

The very brilliant, white object was seen in the eastern sky. It was about 50 degrees above the horizon and appeared to move from south to north and back again, at a fantastic rate of speed. It was visible for 3-10 minutes. They said the object remained stationary, or hovered in one spot for a little while, and then rapidly moved several hundred yards either north or south. The phenomenon was accompanied by peculiar noises somewhat resembling a low frequency humming or buzzing sound.

Summation: The time, direction, duration, description coincides with that of the sighting of the blaze Venus, except that the peculiar noises were not reported in connection with the sighting of the brilliant planetVenus.

(Remaining sighters interviewed by Editor.)

Dep. Sheriff Richard Crum, of Lute County, joined two other officers in observing the object. They said the brilliant white light was as large as a cup (apparent size), it hovered and maneuvered above the treeline to the north for several minutes, then suddenly it seemed to take off at a tremendous speed, disappearing from sight within a few seconds. The same night, Dep. Sheriff Crump was driving east into Johnson City on U.S. 11, and observed a full horizontal blue-white luminous object come a full horizontal distance to the car windshield, then back off and disappear below the horizon.

Text from the document:

Its elevation, seemed to vary, and it bounced back and forth. Its estimate of elevation was 10°-15°. It didn't seem to be far, and it was low, according to the witnesses. The object was about 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed for about 5-6 minutes. The witness said the object in question was 3-4 times the brightness of the full moon. (The nearest objects, buildings and Sheldon Hope's watched the object, later joined by Sgt. Minor). Sgt. Minor (from Luke Gruner's squadron) reported that the object stopped at one point and appeared to be on fire. It was moving and was fairly low, but it wasn't as bright as the stronger spotlights on the ground. The object became smaller as it moved away, and at one point the witnesses estimated its distance at 5 miles. According to Sgt. Minor, the object was bigger than "Venus" which he said was a large, bright object.

Later, two star-like objects were seen moving from N-S. They first moved part of the way, then were just hovering and then the other one started moving. One of the witnesses said the larger object seemed to shoot out between them from the larger body. Later the larger object again appeared on the scene, The time and the object were again observed. The passage north and south continued until the object went an estimated 10 minutes and then reappeared and disappeared in the distance. The object seen was considerably larger than "Venus" which he said was a very bright star in the sky.

A NIGHT WHEN EXCITEMENT REIGNED
August 17, 1964
On this date, Sgt. Roger Brown and Wayre Merrell of the Ohio State Patrol were on duty in a marked patrol car when they received a radio call concerning a UFO sighting. Patrolman Brown told of the episode. At 3:30 A.M. they were proceeding on Route 35 when they observed what appeared to be a bright, yellowish-orange object hovering in the sky to the north side of the highway. They stopped the patrol car and got out to observe the object, which was about 1,000 feet in the air. It was the size of a basketball, quite bright, and rotating in a clockwise direction. It was stationary for about 5 minutes, then took off at a very high rate of speed toward the east, going out of sight in about 10 seconds. The patrolmen said it seemed to take on a reddish-orange color as it sped away.
Later during their shift, Brown and Merrell spotted the same or a similar object again hovering in the sky. They drove toward it but it took off at a very high rate of speed and left them behind. After observing the object, they reported the sighting by radio.
Michael Garten who was Sgt. Brown's supervisor, joined them at the scene. The Willoughby police chief, A. L. Turner, also came out to see the object, but by then it had disappeared.
The object was described as being approximately the size of a basketball and maneuvering much like a satellite in the sky. It would sometimes appear to stop and hover, then take off at a very high rate of speed. At one point, it seemed to change color from yellowish-orange to reddish-orange.
This spot is on S. R. 44 near the residence at 39000. The radio-dispatched time was 4:30 A.M., and the object was observed for about 15 minutes after first observing it.
Sgt. Merrell returned to where the UFO had been observed, but he found no burned spots or anything else of an unusual nature at the site.
This was not the only sighting of a UFO that night. A while earlier, an unidentified flying object was spotted by two women in a residential area of Willoughby, Ohio. The object was described as being a bright, reddish-orange illumination. It was observed for several minutes before disappearing from sight.

CIGAR ON FACE OF MOON
At about 2:30 A.M. (August 27), 19 year old Dan Besse reports that he saw a large cigar-shaped craft which hovered for about 4 minutes close to the upper right-hand corner of the moon, then pick up speed and vanish in the east. He is night watchman for Neil Greenland, Inc. 2044 on RT. 17 (Lincoln Mills). When he made the report, he said: "I would judge it was 40 to 50 feet in length. A light glowed all around it and it trailed somewhat as it moved across the face of the moon. It seemed very close, far closer than the moon itself." 7 would judge it was far to be a satellite, an undoubtedly a saucer-shaped craft which launches the saucer-shaped craft." There is little to add to this description. It doesn't often get reports as well documented as this one.

The object was observed from a distance and then disappeared into the mountains. The report mentions the observer, Mr. F. D. Snow, and provides some details about the incident.

Text extracted from the document:

Another Disc Near
White Sands
On 29 August 1964, Mr. F. D. Snow
was driving south from Las Cruces, New
Mexico, to his home. As he approached a
change in the road to his left (East) were the
organ Mountains. The time was 11:00 pm.
Snow noticed a large, saucer-shaped
object between him and the mountains.
This object held was at an estimated
altitude of about 3,000 feet and was moving
at a high speed. The object appeared to be
about four miles in size and larger than
a silver dollar held at arm's length.
The object stayed below the peaks as
he observed it from Mesquite Park. New
Mexico, to Mesquite, where the Mountain
Range ends. At this point, the object banked
up and disappeared into a 45 degree angle
up and to the left.
The entire episode was over in
approximately 30 seconds, Mr. Snow
observed the object. The case was reported
the next day to the Air Force, but the man
could provide no further details. The
Green Mountain's Tracking Station at
White Sands Proving Ground had no radar
track on the object.

Ashland Heights, Ohio - August 31, 1952 - 6:15 A.M.
Ronald Shaw, a twenty-one-year-old resident of Ashland Heights, Ohio, reported witnessing the following object:

Ronald said that he arose early to mow his yard, and as he was starting to mow, he glanced up and saw a strange object high in the sky traveling in a northeasterly direction at a very high rate of speed. The object was visible for about 20 seconds, during which time it covered a great distance. Ronald described the object as a medium-sized, disc-shaped craft which appeared to be silver in color. He said it was giving off a bright glow as it flew through the sky. There was no noise associated with the object.

After seeing the object, Ronald called his neighbor, Mrs. J. Frick, who also witnessed the object. Mrs. Frick corroborated Ronald's account of the sighting.

SIGHTINGS
Mrs. Di Franco said it was a bright, white disc whose color varied from white to a pale blue-green. The object appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter and 15 to 20 feet thick. It had a slightly domed top and bottom and gave off a glow all around the object. The object was seen for 2 to 3 minutes, as it flew in a straight line at a very high rate of speed.

Mr. Di Franco said the object was oval-shaped, slightly dome-shaped, and appeared to be about 25 feet in diameter. He said the object gave off a bright glow and had a metallic appearance. The object was visible for about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.

Joseph Seme said the object was shaped like a disc, about 25 to 30 feet in diameter, and was silvery in color. He said it had a slight dome on the top and bottom. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes as it flew in a straight line at a high rate of speed.

Editor's Comment:
The sightings as described are very small, the objects appearing very high and distant. It would be difficult to estimate their size and distance accurately under these conditions. The descriptions, however, do tend to corroborate one another in the main details.

Text transcribed from the document:

Dr. and Mrs. _____, Calumet, Michigan

Several nights ago some friends of ours spotted some strange objects moving in the night sky when the children were in bed. Our friends watched for half an hour, to the houses and seemedstay in the stationary position. The lights were bright, white and steady, and not moving, as far as we could tell, now long the scene lasted.

It is difficult at a distance, to judge the size, but our friends calculate that the objects must have been very large, perhaps as big as airplanes, since they were visible for nearly every watching for these "saucers", part of the group was taken inside to bed. One of the visitors remarked that could we as we were as excited as they were.

One more thing: One might we saw some strange lights in the sky that made us very uneasy, but we watched intently for some time and the lights gradually faded away. The nature of the lights was such that I cannot adequately describe them. There was no sound, no running of motors or anything else, but a gradual brightening and then a gradual dimming, all within the space of a minute, or maybe less.

A.F.R.
A SUMMER
Night April 25 1965 about 9:15 p.m. CST. Indiano.
To whom it may concern. At that time I was a senior at the the Central High School in Anderson, Indiana. I was out on the lawn doing my normal evening study when I noticed a bright light in the western sky - - - - much smaller than the moon but definitely brighter. At first I thought it was a shooting star but as I watched it, it began to move erratically and at a high rate of speed. It would stop, reverse direction and zig zag across the sky. After a few minutes of this it suddenly shot straight up out of sight. I have discussed this incident with a number of people and have concluded that what I saw was some type of unidentified flying object. There was no sound and the object seemed to be maneuvering under intelligent control. This is about the only unusual sighting I have ever experienced but I am quite certain that what I saw was not a normal celestial body or aircraft.

Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Sara:

This communication is to you as to the time identified object which I mentioned. Many observers are now -200 ft-velocity 400-500 mph clearly lighted object seems to hover maneuver and then accelerate to a high rate of speed. This was sighted by Air Force control tower operators and others present. This object was not a plane, satellite or meteor. Air Force and other proper authorities have been informed. Copies of reports there could be more made of the incident.
One like the above date I and recall ever seeing, and this is ready attention me, and I am unable to accept.

- page 239 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten document, likely an old report from Project Blue Book. I will now act as an OCR system and transcribe the text found in the document:

"I decided to get up, and as I glanced out the window, I saw a red light on a piece of ground very close to my house. It was at first very bright, and then suddenly it went out. A few minutes later it appeared again, but this time it was not as bright. I watched it for about 30 minutes, and then this red light suddenly got brighter and brighter, and then it went out again. 
I continued to watch the object, and all of a sudden it appeared to move very rapidly, and then it just disappeared. I continued to watch the object, and then I decided to look out of another window to see if I could see it. I was unable to locate the object.
I felt a little uneasy about the whole thing, and I called a few of my friends to see if they had seen anything, but none of them had. I continued to watch for the object, but I was unable to locate it again.
I would like to compare this incident with other similar incidents that have been reported, and I would be interested to know if there have been any other reports of a similar nature in this area. I am quite certain that what I saw was not an airplane, and I am also certain that it was not a satellite or a meteor. I would be interested in any information that you could provide on this subject."

This was not a saucer as I have observed the attitude to be one of other satellites I have observed. It was at a considerable speed, and its object seemed unusual. I have observed to as far as I have communicated will to stay in your effort to determine if the existence of saucers or space stations and I might find that they worked I have since and - I merely hope was consciousness for us the and it seems that would be dead. But up distribution to our consciences for life. (Atlas) probably more conformed for of I have that something that seems to be limited somewhat died. Helpfully.

OFFICIAL FILE COPY 
August 13, 1964

FOR: The declassifier of your letter of 13 August 64. 

SUBJECT: Unidentified aerial phenomena. 

YOUR OBSERVATIONS: Thank you very much for your letter of 13 August concerning your observations of unidentified aerial phenomena.  I appreciate your interest and hope my explanations will be helpful.

As your observations indicate, there are times when objects in the sky are not readily identifiable. However, this does not necessarily mean they are of extraterrestrial origin. There are many possibilities as to what they could be, such as conventional aircraft, natural phenomena, or man-made objects. The Air Force routinely analyzes such observations in an effort to identify the objects. If they remain unidentified after this analysis, they are filed for reference. The great majority of these observations are eventually explained as conventional or natural in origin.

I also analyzed the observers on the description you provided. While I would like to analyze the object in more detail, your description indicates it was not an extended observation and precise details are lacking. However, I will file this report with the others for reference and comparison if similar reports are received.

Thank you again for your letter and please keep your future observations. 

Sincerely,

CAPTAIN HECTOR QUINTANILLA

Dear Sir:
For some reason or another, you
get a letter of this kind, and it is perhaps the only explanation you 
will hear regarding the matter. I am sorry that I can not give you
more details, but I am just as puzzled about the whole matter as
you are. The only thing I can say is that on the night of August 
9, 1964, I observed a strange object in the sky which I could not identify
as any known type of aircraft. It was quite a distance away, and
I was unable to get a good look at it, but it appeared to be a bright
light, oblong in shape, hovering in the sky. I watched it for 
several minutes before it disappeared from sight. I immediately
reported the sighting to the proper authorities, but I have heard
nothing further about it. I hope this brief account is of some 
help to you in your investigation.

Sincerely yours,
[ILLEGIBLE]

Guy Risian Tells
of W.A.A.F. Sighting
I do not know to what extent the picture itself represents the incident your readers saw, as you do not say. However, the people who saw many such things as
we saw many new homes, lovely
grass and beautiful trees, felt sure
they saw something strange and
clothed with some costume and
apparently being seen for the first time in this area.
This sighting was reported by students, teachers, office girls and government officials. They appear to be typical Americans.
It has been said of the Canadians
citizens, to give preference to
their British masters, they were
seen in paper caps and casual clothes; where in Paper Park, Canada, their leader was seated in a large chair or throne."
A lady was seen waving to them
in a field, then a very friendly
gesture on the part of two Christian women from Pleasant Corners,
Texas, who waved with joy at seeing the space men as they hovered
above their homes were most unexpected."

From the text, it appears this is a report of a UFO sighting, with details about the witnesses (students, teachers, office workers, government officials) and some descriptions of the object and its behavior (hovering above homes, seen by many people). However, there is no photograph or image contained in this particular document page.

The image provided does not contain any photograph. It is an excerpt from an old document titled "Thinking Of Survival" that discusses topics such as survival programs, the native populations in Africa, and the importance of self-preservation.

Thinking Of Survival
EDITOR: Standard Times, 'RICHARD GORDON, Editor of The Detroit Free Press, says the 'White people in America and Asia and don't know it. But thanks to our many programs on survival, I am sure they are doing something about it.'
The article states that "Thanks to our many programs on survival, I am sure they are doing something about it" in response to the increasing threat that is growing through mass survival groups. It discusses how during the past several years, people have become interested in survival skills and techniques, such as building wooden ships and planning for wars. The writer suggests that the white people in Africa are trying to exterminate the natives and get out, just as the native Americans were exterminated in the past. The article concludes by stating that "it is high time the people of the world to do like everything else and think first, foremost and only of self-preserve, the chance and survival."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

It seems that there is a great interest in the flying saucer subject as far as this mail is concerned, and people of the world, especially the United States and Russia, are anxiously seeking knowledge of the presence of intelligent creatures in fields and McCoys of Kentucky. What disturbs us is the fact that we have not yet any substantiated reports from this region or from any other place on earth or from outer space if you please. There is a great deal of evidence that flying saucers are visiting our world, but it would be very unwise to conclude with it as a conclusive proof. What seems to be little understood anywhere near the coast of France or South America.

Some people believe that flying saucers are of extraterrestial origin. They are constantly trying to extend their activities and knowledge for the observation of events that are allegedly taking place on earth and in the world and from pole to pole. Here is a great deal of evidence that they do not like for the survival of the human race and that is known to many people.

The Bible says "As in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the coming of the Son of Man." The Bible also says "They shall not obey. They shall know the mysteries". Whether flying saucers have any lightning see, have no justification for any of the present day religions, is an open question since some people usually have more faith in other creatures than in the one that created them.

WORLD PEACE
The population of America is made up of people from all of the countries of the world, being called "the melting pot" of the world. They have come from all races and religions. They have been accustomed to the best and most hopeful chance for ending wars and getting peace.
It seems to be the best and most hopeful chance for ending wars because we are a country made up of all kinds of people from all over the world. We have been accustomed to getting the "best and most hopeful chance for ending wars and getting peace."
The text goes on to discuss how in any future conflict, restraining or eliminating war would be far more drastic than ever before, as war would destroy and demoralize the people and the country.

Dear Sir,

On or about the night ot August 15, 1964 while at my grandparent's cottage at Rainier on Lake Washington 25 miles east of Seattle, Washington, my attention was drawn to the eastern sky at about 10:40 PM. I observed what appeared to be a luminous object approximately 1 1/2 to 2 magnitudes brighter than the brightest star in the sky at the time, proceeding in a straight line from slightly north of east to slightly south of west at an apparent angular velocity of approximately 1 degree per second. The object appeared to be self-luminous, without trail or halo, and seemed to be at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. I watched it for approximately 5 to 10 seconds as it traversed about 10 degrees of arc in the sky before it disappeared below the western horizon. I am a graduate engineer and am quite familiar with aircraft of all types, as well as astronomical phenomena. This object did not conform to the characteristics of any known aircraft, nor did it have the appearance of a meteor, satellite, or any other recognized astronomical body. I am completely at a loss to account for what I observed on this occasion, and would appreciate any comments or observations you may be able to provide regarding this incident.

Sincerely yours,

- page 265 -

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from what seems to be an old UFO report document, containing handwritten text.

Transcription of the text:

Clarification: There were a bright, greenish streak of light observed in the sky, and a fairly good-sized, round light object (which appeared to have a dark center) moved on a constant course with the bright streak, as if the two objects were connected.

This sighting occurred at about 8:50 PM for over 2 minutes. The bright streak of light was traveling in a diagonal course from the northeast to the southwest, and the object was following it closely. At one point, the object caught up with the streak and appeared to join or merge with it.

Both the streak and the object moved in a straight, uniform motion across the sky. The object was easily visible and was quite large (estimated to be about 1/3 the apparent size of the moon). 

I thank you sincerely,

The image contains a newspaper clipping with the headline "THE 'SAUCER' WAS HOAXED FOR BARRY". The clipping appears to be reporting on a hoax involving a "saucer" that was created for someone named Barry.

Text extracted from the document:

THE 'SAUCER' WAS HOAXED FOR BARRY
The sensational newsgather movement called the "Saucer" movement created a commotion for months on the 20th of the current month when reports were released that a flying saucer had been found in a field. It was being investigated by Government officials and exciting the people. Now it is reported that the mysterious affair was hoaxed for a Barry, who was reported to have been commissioned by a national magazine to investigate saucer stories. The Government reveals that the "saucer" was a hoax and had no connection with the real investigation of the many saucer reports received from the public through channels.
