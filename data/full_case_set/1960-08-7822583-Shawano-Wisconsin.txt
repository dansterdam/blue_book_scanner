UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: Shawano, Wisconsin
Date: 26 August 1960    Hour (s): 01:30?

Which appears: call 2500? broken, 14 to 18' in diameter, whitish in color, with body, moved fast moving back and forth, changing size and direction.
First seen, moved to South, viewed for 2 minutes

Direction of Motion: South.
Satellites: (ARGIN-FM3, Phone 69219)

Evaluation of Source Reliability: ACCURATE

Analysis and Conclusions: It is possible that this object or phenomenon was caused by some breakdown of a star or planet or even SWAMP GAS, which seems very plausible since the appearance, location, motion and duration are very similar to many other UFO sightings in this general area of the country.
