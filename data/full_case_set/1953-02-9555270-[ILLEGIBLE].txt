AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

15 2110 hours, 26 February 1953, D/F called operations and told us about a red light in the sky. He had observed it for approximately 2 minutes. It was moving out at a fast clip. It went up and down and made a 360 degree turn. It was a blinking light which seemed to be about 15-20 miles away. He could not judge the size or altitude. When the light went out, he called the Japanese guard and asked him if he had seen it. The guard said yes and that he thought it might be a jet. This caused the D/F to call us.
There were two (2) planes in the sky. So we asked the D/F if either one of them had the light. He said no, these were standard aircraft. So we questioned him further about the one he had observed. According to the information he gave us, this did not sound like a normal aircraft light. He reported this to us. This compared to 1137 hours.
At 2219 and 2258 hours, we had two distinct surface-to-air missile firings. The first one was visible on the scope but the second one could not be traced as the observation area was about 25 miles away. We could not determine if these were related to the light that was observed at 2110 hours.
About 2300 hours, the D/F called again and said he had observed the light again and this time he said it seemed to be traveling at about ten (10) feet in diameter when it observed it again. They told us if we came, we could get a picture of it.
About 0305 hours, W/C had got three (3) reports that very interesting information about an object at 2238 hours. This was flashed at 2245 hours. The flash was visible for about 10 seconds only. We flashed at 2219 hours and was identified as surface-to-air missile firing. D/F called and told us that sergeant had seen three (3) of the same sort of lights that had been observed earlier.

At approximately 2110 hours, 26 February 1953, I saw a strange ball in the sky about forty miles away and approximately 1,200 to 1,500 feet in altitude. It appeared to be stationary or slowly rotating, and was flashing various colors as it was observed.

After that, a searchlight was apparently used to watch the ball again. As it descended, it appeared to stop and hover, then seemed to go out. It was observed for approximately 15-20 minutes. 

On 28 February 1953, a bright object appeared in the sky, which seemed to be high and bearing was the same as the ball mentioned above. It was observed for approximately one-half hour and disappeared.

"The report indicates file RB 2-53 contains information on this sighting, which the 2854th AACS Group has determined was not a UFO, but rather a flight of balloons which was tracked at that time. As indicated, this observation was reported in accordance with existing procedures and a floarcard for this reason. No investigation determined the objects were unusual or unidentified."
This headquarters has received a letter message from reporting agency which stated that further investigation determined the object sighted was VENUS on 26 Feb 53.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: G-2, 507th ACSW, GS-AFC 929
DATE: 2b FEB 53
SUBJECT: Unidentified Object Sighting

1. Description of Object: The object was described as bright star-like and was larger than a star. It appeared to be in the southern part of the sky at an altitude of 45-50 degrees. There was no luminous trail and it was static, as looking similar to the aircraft landing light. There was no noise associated with the object.

2. Manner of Observation: The object was first sighted at 2100 i/. Observations were made with the naked eye and 7x50 binoculars.

3. Manner of Observation: Four observers were stationed at predetermined positions to observe the object. The observers maintained visual contact until the object disappeared from view, and no estimated distance from their position.

4. Action Taken: The observers were advised as to the proper procedure to follow in plotting the object's position at given intervals for a more accurate location. The object was plotted on a polar grid and its angular elevation was measured with a clinometer. This was done to establish the object's true position and to determine if it was in fact an unidentified flying object.

5. Weather Conditions: Between 2000/I and 2200/I, 26 Feb 53:
Visibility - 8 mi
Wind - Calm
Clouds - 8/10 cover - cirro-stratus and cumulo-nimbus

ATIC Document 123865, Northwest Hokkaido, Japan

At approximately 2100I, 25 Feb 53, an unidentified airborne object was reported seen by several members of an ACAW Squadron. The object changed colors from red to pink-orange and then to white. Sighted by several members of the detachment. The object appeared to move slowly toward the horizon then abruptly disappeared. Azimuth and elevation readings at 2155 hours on the 25th was 285 degrees from true north and 18 degrees 12 minutes above horizontal.

One member of the observing party, an Air Force major, stated that he believed the object was an obvious natural star or planet.

ATIC Comment: Azimuth and elevation readings indicate that the sighted object was the planet Venus. Dr. [REDACTED], ATIC astronomer, concurs with this evaluation.

STATEMEHT

At 1105/1, 29 Feb 53, I was standing outside the operations building at Ft. Leonard wood, Mo. when I observed a round silvery object at about 2,000 feet in altitude moving from north to south at a rapid rate of speed. The object appeared to be about 25 degrees from the vertical, reflecting sunlight, and had no visible tail or exhaust. It was followed by a similar object about 15 degrees behind the first one. Both objects moved at a constant speed without any variation in altitude and disappeared from sight in a southerly direction.

NARRATIVE
On 12 Feb 53, I observed an unidentified object with binoculars, for a period of 5 to 10 minutes. The object appeared to be about the size of a star, as near as I could judge it. It was moving in an erratic manner at a high rate of speed, constantly changing direction and altitude. It was brighter than the stars around it. There was no change in the intensity or brilliance of the object during the period of observation. When I first saw the object, it was at about 80 degrees of azimuth from my position, and an elevation of about 30 degrees. Over a period of 5 to 10 minutes it moved to about 60 degrees of azimuth, and 45 degrees of elevation, where it disappeared from view, still moving. There was no sound associated with the object, nor any trail or exhaust. This is the only unidentified object I have observed.

STATEMENT
The object was first sighted on 26 Feb 53 at 2115/T. One bright star-like object, 1.5 to 2 degrees in diameter, was observed at 40 degrees above the horizon bearing 320 degrees from the observer. It was the shape of a star with a very clear and distinct outline. There was no noticeable movement during the 10 seconds of observation. Then the object disappeared instantly without any noticeable trail or exhaust. There was no sound of any aerodynamic features, although there was a very dim light source from the object. It was on a constant southwardly course and seemed to be at an altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. It was first sighted at 2130/T with the color ranging from white to blue-white. The object appeared to be the size of a small aircraft but had no visible structure or outline that would indicate a conventional aircraft. It made no sound and had no exhaust trail. During the sighting, the weather was very clear and calm.

This report contains "a perusal with a series of sightings reported on 23 Feb 53 which ranged the Western part of Japan from Kushiu to Honshu". The reports have been reasonably well explained by further investigation on the part of personnel concerned. It indicates that:
- IR 3-53 (report on 3th 20) indicates object alleged to be a star
- IR 3-53 (report on 3th 20) suggests the possibility that a brilliant light may have been the planet Venus
- IR 1-53 (report on 3th 7), which suggests the possibility that a luminous glowing object may have been an aircraft, has been explained by further investigation as the result of an optical illusion caused by certain atmospheric conditions
- IR 3-53 (report on 5th 20) was supplemented by an additional late report from another agency which stated that the object sighted was determined upon further investigation to have been a meteor.
The weather section at this Headquarters confirms the legitimacy of initial explanations VENTS as specific cases, could have caused the phenomenon related to these sightings.
This Headquarters believes that, in all probability, sites 3 and 17 also may have seen VENTS or a bright star.

1. Description: Oh, it was round 3 or 4 times larger than a star, reddish-orange, moving very slow almost unnoticeably. Sighting was made at 2230 lt., 26 Feb. 1953.
2. Number of sighting: Sighting was visual by two persons.
3. Date/Time Group: Observed: 35 degrees 25 minutes N - 136 degrees 25 minutes E. Beppu, Japan, 35 degrees 25 minutes N - 136 degrees 25 minutes E.
4. Weather condition: Wane. Weather was CAVJ temperature 35 degrees.
5. Other Pertinent Information: No physical evidence.
6. Action taken: Notified all sites to stay on alert for unusual sightings.
10. Air traffic: No aircraft of any type in vicinity.

COMMENT OF PREPARING OFFICER:
ACGW Dpt. and CPT were interviewed by intelligence officer. 232th ACGW Dpt, both were of opinion that they would not have reported the incident if they had not been required to do so. The incident was of such nature that it was moving so slow as to be scarcely observed. No radar contact was made and no anti-aircraft weapons were fired.

Possible explanation for sighting: At 2210t, 26 Feb. 1953, all radar sites in central area of Honshu, Japan were alerted to watch for unusual sightings. Object sighted at heading of 265 degrees from Site 3 would indicate the object might have been the lights of an aircraft or some other object in the sky which were flying in their local area. No aircraft were flying at Johnson, and the weather search lights at Tacoma and Tachibana were on.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

HARROLD, TEXAS, at approximately 2040, 23 FEB 53, observed visual contact with an unidentified aerial object while on an air patrol flight. The object was described as being white in color, pointed in the front, flat on the bottom, and about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. It was moving at a very high rate of speed and had a tail of blue-white flame. The object disappeared rapidly to the south. No unusual sounds or odors were reported.

Transcribed text from the document:

At approximately 2131, 26 Feb 53, while on duty as a Senior Operator, this detachment received a report from the crew of a C-47 aircraft, AT-184 and the crew reported that while on a routine flight over the coastal area of Korea, they sighted an unidentified luminous object which appeared to be about 20,000 feet in altitude and traveling approximately 600 mph. The object was described as varying in color from yellowish-white to reddish-white. It was sighted for approximately 10-15 seconds. The crew immediately notified the 5th Air Force Operations Officer and also the commanding officer of this station and have our Commanding Officer make a report of same.

On the same date, Major Warol arrived at Operations immediately after our report to him. He stated that he had been contacted by the Control Center of the Fifth Air Force and that the Fifth Air Force had been contacted by the Tokyo Air Defense Command to investigate this incident. Major Warol asked our Commanding Officer for further details and took a bearing on the flight path of the object. We found it to be 230 degrees from our station and this checked with the information from the Fifth Air Force Control Center.

It was approximately fifteen (15) miles in distance and was observed to be traveling in a north-easterly direction. It was described as being approximately 60-80 feet in diameter and seemed to be glowing. It was observed for approximately 5 seconds and then started some procedure which appeared to be again. I also reported that our radar at this time was not in operation and that no identification had been made.

At approximately 2357, we received a report from the Japanese Coast Guard that there had been an incident in the area that we had reported concerning. The name of this vessel was Towa Maru. I informed the Operations Officer of this information.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Object was a bright green light that appeared to explode and break into several pieces. The observers reported that an occasional flash or red could be observed in the intervals between the pieces. The object was brighter than the surrounding stars, but did not appear to twinkle as a star does. The object seemed to move erratically, but the observers were unable to estimate the size or shape of the object.

DURATION OF SIGHTING: At 1930 for approximately 90 minutes.

LOCATION OF OBSERVERS: Visual sightings from the ground at ZIOL 2240.

CONCLUSIONS: Throughout the period of sighting, the observers maintained visual contact and stated the object moved erratically, sometimes hovering and at other times moving at a high rate of speed. The object was observed through a pair of binoculars and was seen to break into pieces, with a reddish flash being observed between the pieces. The observers were unable to estimate the size or shape of the object, but stated its apparent size was approximately 0.8°. The object was observed for a period of approximately 90 minutes, finally disappearing from sight.

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ON OBSERVERS: The observers were 2 Air Force Airmen stationed at DAQI and residents of the nearby town. The Airmen have had some experience with various night lights and phenomena and consider their observation of this object to be unusual. No further identifying data is available.

STATEMENT

It is approximately 2200 on the night of 7 February 1953. I observed an object, which is approximately circular in shape and varying in color from deep red to orange. It appeared to be from 100 to 150 feet in diameter and to have been illuminated from within, as there was a constant glow about it. Five minutes later, it changed back to a reddish-orange color and then to a whitish-orange. About ten minutes later, it changed again to a deep reddish-orange color.
The object then hovered or suspended in midair over a heavily wooded area about 3 to 5 miles away from my observation point. I watched it for some time, and it seemed to be maneuvering over a wide area, but I know that it was not some sort of strange celestial body, because my observations of it were clear and distinct.
Then it seemed to me of how to estimate the size, altitude, and distance both in relation to my observation point. I would judge the altitude, to be 10 to 12 miles from the ground, but over the horizon, as I could not distinguish any terrain features. During this time, it seemed to move both vertically and horizontally. I would say that it moved about 100° in both directions.
At about this time, the object appeared to divide into two parts, and the following sequence of events took place: The two parts separated one from the other, and maintained this separation for several minutes, and then the two parts appeared to merge together again, the total time of separation being 3 to 4 minutes. After the two parts had merged, the object continued its erratic maneuvers and changes in color. And I could not see or determine if there had been any sightings or objects, or other objects. There had been aircraft in the control tower if they had been on duty, they did not see this object. These proceedings I

STATEMENT

On approximately 27 February 1953 at approximately 2000I an object was observed in the sky outside a medium sized city. The object appeared too large and too close to the earth to be a star. Two policemen observed the object which appeared to be metallic and somewhat elliptical in shape. The object hovered stationary for some time and then began to move in an erratic manner, sometimes appearing to move rapidly, then stopping and even reversing its course. The object would also make sharp turns and change direction unexpectedly. The object gradually moved up and away until it was out of sight. After watching the object for some time, the witnesses could not determine its nature or what it might be.

to 2400 hrs, when Sgt. Ray was sent to investigate a flight of 8 lights travelling
slowly at about 1500 feet. Col. Ellison who was the senior controller in on 3/35-,
Lt Ray Watson and PVT Sullivan to go outside and try to observe this. 
This activity was noticed by Capt I. Schreiber in charge of the elevations about 275 degrees.
Elevation about 20 degrees. The size of this object was that of a very large
aircraft. It approached to not more than 2 miles and seemed to be a single light that pulsed, brighter and dimmed repeatedly. Sgt. Watson called in a report to the operations
building at almost 22.25 2/9/ 53. Sgt. Watson said this object seemed to be about
4,000 feet and came in slowly with no trail or appreciable change of speed or direction. It finally just faded away as an aircraft travels out of sight. I would say the

STATEMENT

It about 2230 hours 26 February 1953, 2/Lt. William Stendridge told Lt. Willis in the operations building and asked us to go outside the operations building and observe what we could. He went outside the operations door (approx. 30 seconds) climbing and climbed on 10" or a 10 foot embankment. In west (azimuth 255 degrees) elevation approximately 500 feet. He observed that object more than a large star but less than a star and was enough to show definite round. It was ahout 1/2 diameter of star itself. It made a pulsating motion. He watched it for 2-3 minutes. While he was watching, the object started to move downward from 500 feet to 3 degrees elevation. It dropped in about 1 minute or minute and a half, then it stopped to about 10 degrees elevation and stayed there for a minute or so. Then it started to climb back up to about 70 degrees elevation and stayed there for awhile. Then it disappeared.  We do not think it disappeared over the horizon. When the thing disappeared it was 2215 hours.

Here is the text found in the document:

NARRATIVE: On 26 February 1953 at approximately 2110 hours an unusual object was sighted west of 3D Ground Radar Site, Misawa, Japan, which is located approximately 55 miles northeasterly from Akita, Japan. The object was reported to have been stationary, in the form of a bright orange colored light. It decreased in size and became smaller, changing from an oval to a round shape. The object gave off a bright light and at an altitude estimated to have been from 30,000 to 50,000 feet there was a 270 degree magnetic disturbance, and at an altitude estimated to have been from 30,000 to 50,000 feet there was a 270 degree magnetic disturbance. The object was seen for approximately 2110 until approximately 2120 hours and it disappeared at approximately 2120 hours.

At 2300 hours, another flight was seen at a bearing which approximate that of the previous object, hovering, and then moved rapidly to the surface of the water and moved slowly in a northerly direction. This light disappeared at approximately 2311 hours.

At approximately 2214 hours, three (3) unidentified blips were reported on the radar scope which were identified as unknown targets.

At approximately 2340 hours, a red streak of light of unknown size and shape was seen to rise vertically to a height of approximately 800 feet, range estimated at 800 to 1000 yards. It then disappeared.

COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER: This report is unclassified if they had any ships in the area with negative results. No aircraft were in the area. Weather was CAVU. Interrogations were verbal without official aids. Negative radar contacts on initial sighting. No photographs were taken. This report is submitted in accordance with Ltr.
