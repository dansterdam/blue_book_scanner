The image does not contain any photographs, only a sketch and a compass diagram. The text in the image says:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:  7 1 day Sept month 65 year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire is as follows: 
Salt Lake City Center would have a good idea as to your past project and aircraft flight. This was about 40 mi. South of us
reported first to Salt Lake Center. This strange object appeared at 2030 o'clock posit on and moved to 2130 o'clock
position where we lost sight of it. It did not reappear. The plane - didn't seem to gain on it - it had a much higher
altitude.  

It has been almost a month since sighting it - believe that I saw an air traffic control contacts, on the
pilots them selves - were to have these fears on hand. A lot more accurate report could be given.

This image contains a photograph of a hand-drawn sketch depicting the shape and details of a UFO or unidentified aerial object. The sketch includes an arrow beside it to indicate the direction of motion of the object. The text in the image appears to be part of a questionnaire or report form related to the observation of this UFO.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes - the light just went out or no fade out or change of brilliance. It just went out like being turned off.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and indicate whether trails or vapor trails Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: Felt didn't have a good idea as to our position, as we were on a radar detector and United Airlines flight 4136 was observed about 75 cents South of our heading. Our heading was 500, altitude 33000', the object appeared at about 10 o'clock position and moved to a 3 o'clock position. It moved in a horizontal plane - didn't seem to gain or lose altitude. It has been almost a month since sighting it - believe that all pilots from United Airlines flight at that time have gone to serve in Viet Nam and a lot more accurate report could be given.
