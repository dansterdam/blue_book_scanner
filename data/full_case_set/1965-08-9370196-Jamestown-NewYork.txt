PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 23 August 65 24/00402
2. LOCATION: Jamestown, New York
3. SOURCE: Civilian 
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Two
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 4 - 5 Minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: Stationary
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
10. CONCLUSION:
1. Astro (VEMIS)
2. INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Object appeared as a silverblue light brighter than 1st mag. Located just above the horizon in West. Dusk. Clouds in the background. Object moved slowly to South and disappeared over the horizon. While on more vertical this object as brilliant blue light was as 1000 FT away. This lasted for 4-5 minutes. This caused heavy static and distorted TV picture. Observer stated that he saw same thing two days earlier only didn't tell anyone.
Case followed up wcresponse on Cherry Creek sighting 18 Aug. Youth 15 yr old. Doesn't appear logical that he would report one object as he was doing by calling the Air Force and yet HCP report a more unusual sighting. 1st object settled in approximately 270 degree azimuth in the process of setting and appeared to be approximately 1000 feet in altitude. No evidence of a fact uncovered. SAIC ELLIS.
