13. WHEN A PICTURE IS TO BE TAKEN, AN UNEXPLAINED PICTURE, IT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY INSPECTED TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO OBVIOUS INDICATIONS THAT IT WAS MADE WITH A TRICK LENS OR WAS EXPOSED IN SOME WAY ON A PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINT. THE REASON FOR THIS STATEMENT IS THAT THE ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS REACHED WILL DEPEND UPON A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE DETAILS OF THE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF ANY POSSIBLE FABRICATION OR TRICK PHOTOGRAPHY.

14. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP OR THE MOON. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. NOW, IF YOU HAD A PICTURE, THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE OBJECT COULD BE ESTIMATED, FROM THIS MEASUREMENT, WHAT REAL SIZE YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE OBJECT TO BE.

I first spotted the object by the glow from the engine itself, it was bright and seemed to be pinpointed on an object while the glow from the object spread over an area too wide to look like the engine itself. The blueish white glow was quite distinct and seemed to be caused by some type of reaction, the object was definitely not an ordinary aircraft or meteor. It seemed to move in a straight line for a short period and then suddenly disappeared to the south.

Your name was been given to the Aerial Phenomena Office as having seen an unusual bright meteor, called a fireball, in the early morning hours of 5 August 1959. If this is true, we would appreciate your completing the attached AF Form 117 on your sighting and return it to us in the enclosed self-addressed envelope. This data, when compiled, will be used in Project Blue Book and your cooperation will be most helpful to the Air Force and the American Meteor Society. The data contained in these reports will then be used to compute the trajectory of the fireball and the probable impact point of the meteorite. Thank you for your cooperation.

began watching new aircradt coming which was bright,
Diamond sizing of hanos. Seemed to be hover in air 
about 3 minutes. Good - very clear night. Brilliant object 
not like any aircradt I ever say. Told father I would report
this to proper authorities.
Resumed watching of object went another 3 minutes
and then it disappeared. Left no trail as far as we could 
determine. Moved up and down and seemed to vibrate.
Object was sighting or bright nite (not so bright as search 
light) and would appear to be nigh. Object disappeared into 
clouds, which were about half as high. 
This is what we saw. As I said, never seen anything

The image contains two diagrams related to a UFO sighting report.

The large central diagram appears to be a compass or direction indicator, with labels for the cardinal directions and intermediate points. The text below this diagram indicates that it is used to record the position of the observed object relative to the observer.

The two smaller diagrams below appear to be sketches or illustrations related to the UFO sighting. The left-hand diagram shows a landscape view of the observed object, while the right-hand diagram shows a more distant, expansive view of the landscape with the object in the distance.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document with sketches of what appear to be UFO sightings or reports. The document discusses an object that was sighted, describing its various features and characteristics.

Text transcription:
"The object in question was observed by numerous witnesses, some of which observed the object for as long as 15 minutes. The object was described as being circular in shape, approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter, and gray in color. It was reported to be hovering at an estimated altitude of 500 to 1000 feet above the ground. The object was also reported to have displayed pulsating or flashing lights along its periphery. Several attempts were made to draw the object, with one such sketch included in the report.

The reporting individual stated that the object was maneuverable and appeared to be under intelligent control. It was further reported that the object was able to accelerate rapidly and change direction at high speeds. The incident was investigated by the Air Force under Project Blue Book, but no definitive conclusion or explanation was provided for the sighting."

The phenomenon appeared as a streak of light moving across the front of the street, having a small bright light followed by a trail of smoke or vapor that receded in the distance. The object seemed to move rapidly and silently, as if it were some type of craft or vehicle. It is difficult to determine the exact nature of the phenomenon, whether it was a conventional object or something more unusual, since there are limited details provided in the report. The phenomena seemed to contrast with the surrounding environment, but more information would be needed to make a definitive assessment.

Dear sir,
Maybe this letter could be of interest to you. Of course, I don't know just how important it is, but since I did observe the strange object, I thought I would pass the information along.
On the morning of August 13, about 1:30 A.M., my family and I were driving from our farm near {location} to {location}. As we were driving down the highway, we suddenly saw a bright light in the sky ahead of us. At first, we thought it might be an airplane, but as we got closer, we could see that it was not an airplane at all. The light seemed to be just hovering in the sky, and it appeared to be oblong in shape. It was a very brilliant white light, not blinking or flashing like an airplane.
We were all quite amazed at the sight, and my husband slowed the car down so we could observe it better. The object seemed to just float there in the sky for several minutes. Then, suddenly, it took off at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. We were all quite shaken by the experience, and we didn't know what to make of it.
I would be interested to know if anyone else in this area reported seeing a similar object that night. I would appreciate any information you could give me regarding this incident.
Sincerely,
[Signature]

There was a big flash like that of a big blast & it came up from the ground. The object was hovering about 25 to 30 feet off the ground. It didn't move hardly at all. It was sort of circular in shape & the color looked like burnished metal, like stainless steel. It was about the size of a small automobile. The glow got brighter & brighter then the whole thing just disappeared. The sky was clearing up & the sun was coming out that's why I could notice it better. Other people saw it too. The streak was crossing - the sky. The streak was crossing the sky.

TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT:

A shaky and irksome study was made just a few minutes before. The time was 3:50 am and my regular watch with the B-3 and my new Breitling watches were compared. I noted the time at that instant was 3:50 am EST. I mean and accurate to 1 second according to my timepieces. At that precise moment, I noticed 2-3 round objects-greyish in color and about the size of a U.S. quarter or a little larger. They were hovering in the sky at an estimated altitude of from 400 to 500 feet. I have already stated the exact time noted. These objects seemed absolutely motionless and noiseless. After hovering for 20-30 seconds. they slowly moved about 3-400 yards to the southwest of my location, again came to a complete halt and hovered silently for an additional 30 seconds or more. They then accelerated at incredible speed, said to be at least 3 to 4 times the speed of a jet aircraft, and were quickly lost from sight over the distant pine trees after traveling about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile. The color was a very light grey, almost white. They did not blink or twinkle like a star but were evenly illuminated. They cast no beam or trail of light. The night was quite dark and cloudless. I assure you my surprise and wonder, for I have never seen anything like this before and I truly do not know what to make of it. I hope some explanation can be offered and I shall await your report with great interest.

The image does not contain any photograph or visual element. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, which is a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969.

The text on the page appears to be a form or questionnaire used to collect information about UFO sightings. It contains various fields for the observer to fill out, such as "EYEGLASSES", "BINOCULARS", "WINDSHIELD", "SIZE OF VEHICLE", and "DISTANCE & DIRECTION".

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE PHENOMENON THROUGH ANY OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING RESIDUE INFORMATION OR DETAIL:

EYEGLASSES
BINOCULARS
WINDSHIELD
SIZE OF VEHICLE
WINDSPAN
A 63-72 INDIVIDUAL WEAR GLASSES? YES NO
IF YOU SAW ONLY A PORTION OF THE OBJECT OR PHENOMENON, GIVE ESTIMATE OF SPEED.
IF YOU OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME WHAT WAS YOUR ESTIMATE OF DISTANCE OR DIRECTION IN YOUR OWN WORDS.
DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR SAW DETACH OR CUT OFF FROM THE OBJECT AS COMMON OBJECT OR PROJECTS WHICH, WHEN PLACES IN THE SKY, SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU NOTICED THIS PHENOMENON.
COULD YOU GIVE SOME MATERIAL TO WHAT YOU SAW DETACH OR CUT OFF FROM WHAT OBJECT AND SOME INFORMATION ABOUT ITS CHARACTERISTICS?

DID YOU NOTICE ANY ODOR, NOISE OR HEAT EMANATING FROM THE PHENOMENON OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF, ANIMAL OR MACHINERY IN THE VICINITY? YES NO. IF YES, DESCRIBE.

HAS THE PHENOMENON DISTURBS THE GROUND OR LEAVE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE? LIVES YES NO.

The image appears to contain two sketches or diagrams. The larger sketch shows a compass-like diagram with several directional markings, while the two smaller sketches depict landscape scenes, showing a person standing in front of a road or path.

The text below the larger diagram states: "The sketch below, place an "x" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a "y" at the position when last seen. Indicate the movement of the phenomenon between "x" and "y" that is, schematically show whether the movement was to the north, south, east, or west."

The image does not appear to contain any photographic content.

APR 20 1969 (CM)

HOW THIS SKETCH IS USED: AN "X" IS PLACED AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "Y" AT THE POSITION WHEN LAST SEEN. THIS INDICATES THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "Y". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOWS WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS TO THE NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, OR WEST.
