The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from the Department of the Air Force's Staff Message Branch, regarding a UFO sighting report over Arizona during the period of 9:32 to 9:42 PM on August 11, 1965. The document provides details about the sighting, including the object's color (whitish-yellow) and the fact that it was a very bright single object. The document also mentions the large number of telephone calls from both civilian and military personnel regarding the sighting and the detailed information reported, which precludes a detailed report in accordance with Paragraph 14, AFR 200-2.
