Dear Captain (DELETED):

A flight of 5 unidentified targets was detected on radar by qualified radar and air traffic control personnel at the Columbus, Georgia Air Traffic Control Center. The closest target was approximately 8 miles south-southwest of the center at an altitude of 11,500 feet; the targets were travelling at a ground speed of 800-900 knots.

The targets were tracked for approximately 3 minutes and disappeared from the radar scope. No visual sightings were made.

The information has been forwarded to OSIC as a qualified radar incident and we request that OSAC provide additional clarification on this incident.

Sincerely,

Lt Col JOHN 11, OSAF
