"The length of time the object was observed (10 sec) the fact that the pilot observed pieces breaking off the object and the direction of flight (SW to NE) indicate the possibility the object was a man-made object (satellite) Meteorites generally burn out within 2 seconds and generally do not exhibit any visible break-up while they are burning out." However, the pilot could very easily have been mistaken as to the time the object was visible.

SUMMARY OF FACTS: AT ABOUT 1945 HOURS ON 24 SEPTEMBER 1960, THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY AT LEAST THREE AIRCREWMEMBERS OVER THE SPOKANE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. THE OBSERVERS STATED THAT THE OBJECT GAVE OFF A BRIGHT LIGHT WHICH ILLUMINATED THE AREA AROUND IT.
