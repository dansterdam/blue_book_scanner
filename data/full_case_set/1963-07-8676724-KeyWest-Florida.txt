JULY 18, 1963

WASHINGTON 25 D.C.

SIRS:

WHAT I AM REPORTING MAY OR MAY NOT BE OF INTEREST TO YOUR OFFICE. NEVERTHELESS I AM MAKING THIS REPORT.

ON NIGHT OF 18 JULY 1963 FROM MY HOME ON SADDLE BUNCH KEY, NEAR KEY WEST, FLORIDA, I OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE ALMOST DUE NORTH OF MY LOCATION A BRILLIANTLY LUMINOUS OBJECT APPROACHING FROM ALMOST DUE NORTH. UPON CLOSER EXAMINATION I NOTICED THERE WAS NO BLINKING LIGHTS OR RUNNING LIGHTS. THIS OBJECT WAS LITERALLY SILENT AND TRAVELING AT A TREMENDOUS RATE OF SPEED. IT COMPLETED ITS COURSE OVERHEAD AND TURNED TO A WHITISH CLOUD OF SMOKE, PROBABLY DUE TO ALTITUDE AND THE INTENSE HEAT BEING GENERATED. THE OBJECT WAS AS LARGE AS THE FULL MOON AND APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE.

THERE WAS NO TRAIL, SPARKS, FIRE OR FLAME OF ANY KIND AND ALL LIGHTS OR FIRE HAD DISAPPEARED.

THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST PUZZLING THINGS I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE BALLOON THAT WAS VISIBLE TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO AND LOOKED VERY MUCH AS IT DID. THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANYTHING THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR THIS OCCURRENCE, BUT IT QUITE SURE IT WAS AT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM MY LOCATION OVER 10 MILES.

ANOTHER THING I NOTICED ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT BE OF IMPORTANCE, THAT IT APPEARED TO BE DRIFTING OR TOWING SOMETHING SIMILAR IN SIZE AND APPEARANCE BUT HAD SEPARATED SOME DISTANCE AND WAS TRAVELING AT A MUCH HIGHER SPEED.

WHEN IT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED IT SEEMED TO TRAVEL AT A SPEED THAT IN MY OPINION WOULD BE MOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BE ATTAINED BY ANY TYPE OF CRAFT OF ANY KIND. I WOULD APPRECIATE VERY MUCH IF SOMEONE WOULD GIVE THIS INCIDENT SOME CONSIDERATION.

I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS TO BE A FALLING STAR OR ANYTHING I'M FAMILIAR WITH. THANK YOU.

ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 13TH, OUT OF CURIOSITY, ON THE EXACT COURSE

LY 10:40 PM EDT LAST NIGHT (JULY 19TH). IT TOOK A SLIGHT DOWNWARD COURSE INITIALLY AND THEN MAINTAIN ED AN EVEN STEADY COURSE FOR SEVERAL

SADDLE DESERT SHORES
JULY 15 - 1952

W.A.C.P.A. 
WASHINGTON-2$5 D.C.

SIRS:

WHAT I AM REPORTING WAY OR MAY NOT BE OF INTEREST TO YOUR 
OFFICE,NEVERTHELESS I AM MAKING THIS REPORT.

ON NIGHT OF 18 JULY 1952, FROM UR YARD OR SADDLE BUNCH BAY,NEAR 
KEY WEST, FLORIDA, AT APPROXIMATELY 9.05 P.M. EASTERN DAYLIGHT 
TIME, I OBSERVED A BRILLANT LIGHT OR OBJECT ASCENDING FROM THE 
LIGHTS OR BUOYANCY LIGHTS CLOSEST TO SHORE. THIS I WATCHED FOR 
SEVERAL MINUTES AS IT CLIMBED HIGHER AND HIGHER UNTIL IT BECAME 
LOST TO my VISION IT WAS ROUND IN SHAPE AND BRILLANTLY LIT UP 
AND TURNED TO A WHITE CLOUD OR VAPOR TRAIL AS IT CLIMBED.

WHILE SAID OBJECT WAS CLIMBING, SUDDENLY, ALL LIGHTS ON SHORE WENT 
OUT AND I COULD HEArR AN UNUSUAL NOISE, LIKE A SWISHING SOUND WHICH 
FADED OUT AND THEN ALL LIGHTS OR FIRE HAD DISAPPEARED.

THE SPEED OF THIS OBJECT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT THE SAME AS A BALLON 
THAT WAS VISIBLE TWO OR THREE MONTHS AGO AND DRIFTED VERY MUCH AS 
THIS OBJECT DID. IT WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE AND IT HAD A VERY BRIGHT 
LIGHT THAT FADED OUT COMPLETELY UNTIL I COULD NOT SEE IT ANY LONGER.
QUITE SURE IT WAS AT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM MY LOCATION HERE.

ANOTHER THING I NOTICED ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT BE OF IMPORTANCE 
WHEN IT SUDDENLY FLASHED BRIGHT, IT SEEMED TO CAST A GLOW AND 
STREAK IN THE AIR THAT COULD BE SEEN. AND IT WAS TRAVELING AT A HIGH 
SPEED AND THINGS STILL SHOWED TRAVELED TOWARDS AND UPWARD. FROM THE MAIN
CLOUD.

ON THE CLOUD OR OTHERWISE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT FOR SEVERAL
MINUTES AGAIN. THE GLOW WOULD SEEM ENOUGH NOT TO BE FOLLOWING 
ANYTHING ELSE OR REFLECTING.

IF THIS WAS AS INDICATED A SATELLITE OR SOME OTHER SPACE VEHICLE
AND IT WAS SO DARK DISTANCE IT IS POSSIBLE IT HAS APPEARED IN THAT 
AREA. BUT I AM QUITE SURE IT HAD NO RESEMBLANCE TO ANYTHING 
HAPPENED OVER ALABAMA OR MISSISSIPPI IN THAT AREA.

P/S I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS TO BE A FALLING STAR OR ANYTHING 
U FALLING STAR OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND.

THANK YOU
