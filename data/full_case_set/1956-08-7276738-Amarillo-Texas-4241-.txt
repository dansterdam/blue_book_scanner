REPORT
AMARILLO, TEXAS
4 AUGUST 1956
CONTROL NUMBER: 7276738

On 4 August 1956, the Air Force received a report from an observer in Amarillo, Texas, concerning an unidentified flying object. The observer, a civilian, reported observing a luminous body in the sky. The witness stated that the object seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed and was visible for a period of approximately 14 seconds.

Two photographs were taken of the object, which appear to be low-quality images showing only dark backgrounds with some indistinct markings or objects. The photographs do not clearly depict the observed UFO.

According to the report, the witness was unable to provide any additional details about the size, shape, or other characteristics of the observed object. The case was investigated by the U.S. Air Force but no definitive conclusions could be drawn about the nature of the unidentified flying object.
