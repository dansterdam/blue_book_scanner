11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers called duty officer to say that they had been watching a bright starlike object for 20 minutes and they were still watching it. The object was described as being similar to a turnking light, and its side. Comments: A 117 was sent to the observer but was never located. Information as to how long they watched the object for elevation and azimuth when first- and last- seen, and how the object disappeared was not supplied. It seems likely the observer was watching a star/or planet, however until more information is received the case is being carried as insufficient data.

This image contains a compass rose diagram and two sketches or illustrations. The compass rose diagram takes up the top portion of the image and provides instructions on how to indicate the direction of a phenomenon when first observed. The two illustrations in the bottom portion of the image depict a person standing on a road or path in a landscape.

Performing OCR on the text in the image:

6a. now imagine you are at the center of the compass rose. place an "a" on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when first seen. place a "b" on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when last seen.

7. in the sketch below, place an "a" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a "b" at the position of the phenomenon when last seen. connect the "a" and "b" with a line to approximate the path of the phenomenon. refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
