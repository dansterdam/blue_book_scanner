- page 10 -

The image contains two photographs. The first photograph shows a cloud formation with some irregularities or breaks in its structure. The second photograph shows a similar cloud formation with some additional markings or annotations on it.

The text appears to be a technical report on the observations and measurements of these cloud formations, likely in the context of a Project Blue Book investigation. The report discusses the height, structure, and movement of these "noctiluaent clouds" observed on 2 November 1963.

The text reads as follows:

Reports

Low-Latitude Noctiluoent Cloud of 2 November 1963

1. The observed phenomena:
On 2 November 1963 a noctiluent cloud was observed at Knoxville, Tennessee at approximately 18:15 GMT. This observation confirms the existence of these unusual clouds appearing in the southern night sky.

On 15 June 1963 a noctiluent cloud was observed at Wheeler, Alabama at 0400 GMT. Ground observation indicated an origin from the northeast. Analysis of this observation disclosed a more accurate measurement of the cloud depth and height as compared to other available measurements. The results of this analysis are used to study the height of these unusual clouds.

The total extent of the observed cloud as shown in Fig. 1 was approximately 15 degrees in height and about 50 degrees in length. The western edge of the cloud seems darker and more sharply defined, while the eastern edge fades gradually into the night sky. This appearance seems to indicate that the cloud is moving toward the southeast.

Measurements of the points along the cloud indicate that the main part of the cloud is about 112 km high and that the tips of the cloud extend to about 98 km in height. The time of observation was about 15 minutes after sunset, the cloud being illuminated by the sun's rays passing through the atmosphere at a very low angle.

Fig. 1. The observed range and pattern of cloud formation as shown with respect to the Knoxville and the direction of the Pacific Missile Range.

Fig. 2. The photograph shows a closer view of the cloud, indicating that the cloud is linear and branched upward toward the southeast.

While the measurements of relative height seem fairly conclusive, the absolute measurement of the heights are subject to rather appreciable errors. This is due to the uncertainty in the precise location of the cloud areas within the 3-per cent atmosphere refractive layer. The cloud edges shown in Fig. 1 are not sharply defined, and their location along the line of sight is not precisely known. As a consequence we must be cautious in interpreting the absolute heights. However, the relative heights measured appear to be fairly reliable.

Transcribing the text from the document:

"UNCLASSIFIED AS OF THE AIR FORCE ON REPORT COLLECTION RELEASED PROJECT BLUE BOOK WASHINGTON, D.C. 20301

Dear Sirs:

The following unidentified aerial phenomenon was reported in the vicinity of Maryville, Tenn. on 13 November 1963:

AIR FORCE CENTER IS AREA IDENTICAL

A civilian pilot, while flying at about 5000 feet altitude early yesterday morning (at 1:47 a.m. EST), sighted a brilliantly lit object hovering silently in the sky. The pilot stated that the object remained stationary for about 5 minutes, then accelerated and shot straight up out of sight. The pilot, an experienced flier, was shaken by his encounter. He stated that the object was considerably larger than a normal aircraft, and had what appeared to be a brilliant, bluish-white light source within it. At its closest point, the object came within about 1.5 miles of the pilot's aircraft. Two patrolmen on routine patrol in Blount County, Ky. saw the same thing and gave chase, but lost it in the darkness as it accelerated rapidly upward. The patrolmen called in a report, but it was disregarded as "just another flying saucer". The pilot immediately called the local C. A. A. office and reported his encounter. The control tower personnel confirmed that the pilot's report was the same as the patrolman's description.

Personally, I believe the object was either (a) a brilliant experimental aircraft, or else (b) the display and activity of an intelligently controlled extraterrestrial vehicle.

If the object was some secret military device, I hope your scientific and technical people will be as reassured as I would be to know that we have such advanced aerospace capabilities. If, on the other hand, the object was an extraterrestrial vehicle, I sincerely hope the discovery will be made known to the general public ere long. In any case, I feel certain that whatever the object was, it represents a major technological breakthrough of some kind.

I should be most interested to learn if there were any other reports of the incident, or if any steps were taken to investigate it further."

Performing OCR on the text in the image:

There are important omissions among them several that would give the impression of more actual atomic data and nuclear evidence.
This brief book is a worthwhile summary of the subject field. The theoretical and experimental features of certain complex photochemical processes are adequately discussed.
The book covers the scope of this field as it has developed to the present. A point of introduction to the field of electrochemistry.
The modern methods. Other related fields, as for example, certain aspects of the topic of molecular structure, are touched upon. The author gives a critical discussion both of the strengths and limitations of certain methods, highlighting their advantages and short-comings.
The discussion of the scope of the field is, in the reviewer's opinion, a most useful and stimulating one.
One of the talented volumes, as a chemically-oriented scientist is open to see to some of the important applications of electrochemistry.
The equation for the mean ionic size is:
-log x = 0.50 - 0.30 y
which has been widely used. The author now modifies this equation by introducing a correction factor to the linear term, a modification that he shows on the consideration of the experimental data slightly improves the fit.
Approximately 45-50 papers published in 1960 and 1961 are reviewed critically and carefully compared with the present one. Although the terms of this book differ from many standard works in this field, it is a valuable and readable addition to the literature.

CALIFORNIA BOLIVIA. OF 1963. NOVEMBER 7/8 
A.M.S. NO. 2579

On this date at 6:11 p.m. P.S.T. a bright lights appeared over California, coming to a sudden stop and hovering for some time. Numerous people in the area observed this strange occurrence and promptly reported it to the Air Force. A report of this incident was made by Lt. J. L. Mosley, G.S.W.C. Monitoring Team, Station C-6, who in turn advised Captain Ronald D. Lee, 841st ACWI Sq., Hq. CONAD, who is the Air Defense Director for Central California. It was also reported by Major Edward P. Welch, A.M.S.S. Eastern Director for the Central California area. 

The object, described as a brilliant steady light, was observed moving a high rate of speed, stopped suddenly, and hovered for a time. Several observers stated that an oscillating motion could be seen. The object then accelerated and disappeared from sight. It was estimated to be about 10-15 feet in diameter. 

Maj. Welch and Lt. Mosley stated that aircraft from nearby Moffett Field reported visual contact with the object. Although their radar system was not able to locate it, the controllers stated that an unidentified object was in the area. 

Sgt. James E. Freeman, ARA, also reported observing the object. It was first sighted by him at 6:04 p.m. He did not see the beginning, as he had just arrived on the scene. He stated that he observed the object from 6:04 to 6:11 p.m. during which time it hovered, maneuvered, and executed a zigzag pattern. Sgt. Freeman estimated the size as approximately 10-15 feet in diameter. 

To the persons previously mentioned, the press, and the numerous other observers, the object appeared quite remarkable. But it had the opposite effect on the Air Force personnel involved, who seemed rather indifferent and unconcerned. Apparently, they have become somewhat accustomed to these occurrences to the extent that they no longer excite much comment.

Mrs. Jean McGinnis saw the object. Unfortunately, her report was sent duplicate. The same is true of several other witnesses whose names and statements were not obtained. 

This report, A.M.S. No. 2579, was prepared by A. D. Thomas and Mrs. Eileen F. Thomas.

"Another sighting, from the Buenos Aires newspaper "El Mundo," dated November 22, 1963, stated that Argentine residents of this city rushed to their windows at 12:30 A.M. to observe a strange object in the sky. The object was first seen at 12:10 A.M. and was visible for about 45 minutes. It was described as an elongated luminous mass, larger than an airplane and giving off a reddish glow, traveling at a high speed in a zig-zag course above the horizon. Among the numerous witnesses was a policeman who stated that the object was totally silent and did not appear to be an airplane or meteorological phenomenon. The witnesses stated that the object was clearly visible and that they could make out its shape and size."

The image does not contain any photographs. It is a scanned page from a document titled "THE SALTWOOD MYSTERY: Strange happenings in Kent". The text on the page describes an incident that occurred on the evening of Saturday, November 16, 1963 in Kent, where several people reported seeing unidentified flying objects and strange phenomena in the sky.

THE SALTWOOD MYSTERY
Strange happenings in Kent

The evening of Saturday, November 16, 1963, was clear and bright. The moon was full, and many people were out walking in the area known as the Saltwood village... It was a quiet scene, with people going about their normal activities. Suddenly, a bright light was observed in the sky, near the Saltwood Castle. This light seemed to be moving rapidly in an erratic manner, zigzagging back and forth. It would flare up brightly, then fade almost to invisibility, only to reappear again.

The light was first noticed by a group of people walking along a country lane. They stopped to watch the strange manifestation. The light seemed to be descending towards them, then abruptly it would shoot upwards at a tremendous speed. This happened several times, to the amazement of the onlookers. 

The light was also observed by people in other parts of the area. A couple on a country road stopped their car to watch the aerial display, as did several other motorists. All were intrigued by the rapidly moving light, which appeared to be the size of a large star. It was seen by many reliable witnesses over a wide area.

After a time, the light suddenly disappeared behind trees and a few seconds later, reappeared in a new position. This happened several times, giving the impression that the light had wings and was maneuvering behind the trees. 

Another witness, John McCandrick, said he saw a circular object, about the size of a small aircraft, also in the sky. This object had flashing lights around the rim and seemed to be moving silently. It suddenly shot upwards at tremendous speed and disappeared from view.

The strange aerial phenomena were seen by many people over a wide area and caused much speculation and discussion. Some thought it might have been a spacecraft from another world. Others suggested it was some kind of experimental aircraft. Whatever the explanation, the incidents caused much excitement and interest in the Saltwood district on that November evening.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report with some descriptive text.

WHO used to work for the Aeronautic Inspeetion
Section of the engineering Dept, of McDonnell
Aircraft Corp. in St. Louis, Missouri, and who
recently interviewed me, stated that during his
time there he was shown some photographs of UFO's
which he was not permitted to retain or duplicate.
However, he ras permitted to examine them carefully and make written notes. His description of
these sightings closely fits the description given
by Mrs. Stanton, when she was interviewed. It
also fits the description given by several others
who have taken part in these sightings. Some of
the things he saw in the photographs included:
l. Objects hovering and rotating slowly in a
steady, horizontal direction. It definitely
wasn't an aircraft.
2. Objects surrounded by a glowing aura, which
at times seemed to spread out in the shape of 
rays.
3. Objects capable of accelerating very rapidly
from a standstill position.
4. Objects appearing to change their shape and
size radically, apparently under intelligent control.
Some of the theories advanced to explain these
strange things have been seen, and handed on for
scrutiny. These range from interplanetary craft to
dimensions beyond our normal comprehension, and
even ghosts. Sven some accounts of the ghost theory
reach the point of being almost convincing - such
as the story of a ghost seen in England by William
Turnagain Herriott, and a haunted house on the
estate of Lord Dunraven - where a ghost has been
observed moving through the walls. For instance,
some contend that the objects seen may not be real
material things at all, but projections from some
other dimension, perhaps like on the astral plane.
Sane see them as instruments of some intelligence
beyond our comprehension, perhaps like the "manifestations" one sometimes sees in a seance. These are
complex and bewildering phenomena, but they do contain some features which seem consistent with authentic
UFO sightings. Persons who have seen these things
seem to be quite sane and reliable, and their
testimony deserves serious consideration.

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting (

TO: Hq USAF SAP-DTTB (Mrs Gelser)
OSAF 25 D 6

1. Reference the attached letter from (Deleted), dated 9 Dec 63, requesting information on a UFO sighting which occurred at Knoxville, Tenn., on 1 Nov 63, over Tennessee. The information given indicates that this sighting is obviously in error. Sightings by trained observers of this type are rarely made, and on occasion may even appear as a hoax. This does not, however, appear to be the case. The object which Mr. (Deleted) saw is apparently an astronomical phenomena known as satellite decay and may even appear as a hovering or slow moving light in the sky. This phenomenon has been observed by others and appears to be quite well known.

2. Satellite decay (or re-entry) is distinguished from meteors by:
a. The re-entry always has an easterly component.
b. The color band toward the trailing edge is muted and changes to a dark color spectrum as the object breaks up or decays.
c. The deceleration of satellite decay is much longer. Sputnik IV decay on 5 Sep 62 lasted in excess of two minutes and the brighter Vanguard IV was seen for six minutes at the same time with a final portion lasting two additional minutes.
d. The speed is much slower for satellite decay as compared to meteors or normal satellite passages.

Dear Mr. X,

This is in reply to your letter of December 2, 1963, in which you request information concerning the objects observed over Knoxville, Tennessee, on December 15.

The material reported is attributed to a meteor. Contrary to information given you in my letter of December 18, further analysis reveals that this was a satellite decay (or re-entry) rather than sighting of an unknown object. The observational data indicate that the colors, forms, and movements observed were consistent with a satellite decay rather than the sighting of an unknown object. 

The Sputnik IV decay on September 5, 1962 was in approximately the same general area and similar to the displays occasionally observed associated with the decay of orbiting objects as they re-enter the atmosphere. The above is given as the most logical explanation for the sighting in view of the observational data available.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir:

I have some questions I would like answered:

(1) Why is the truth about flying saucers being hidden? I have a right to know. Congressional hearings will reveal information.

Please send me all information on saucers available to the public. Facts about sightings, photos, and other sheets. What is your excuse for withholding orders.

(3) I read that the U.S. Air Force has not witnessed a flying saucer since January 1, 1949. As a result, extensive searches have made some say that a grandiose hoax has been perpetuated on the free world.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]

Dear Mr. [REDACTED]:

Your letter of October 21, 1963, regarding the report of unidentified aerial phenomena is the proper terminology for the subject.

We think it may be of interest to you. The Air Force utilization of the terminology "Unidentified Flying Objects" is no longer in official use. This was changed since it created an implication which is not justified by the public understanding or documentation field records of the Air Force. The Air Force designations are now and always have been available to bona fide scientific researchers.

Enclosed also is a copy of AFR 200-2 which sets up the procedures and explains the method of operation.

Because of the interest you indicated, "The World of Flying Saucers" which would provide you with information on this subject may be obtained by contacting the publishers and dissipating any misinformation you may have on this subject.

Sincerely,

MAJOR M. J. JACKS

Dear sirs:
You say that no evidence or data has been found to substantiate the existence of such information. Here is a sighting of such information and I wish you would consider it.

Please tell me exactly what evidence or data you have. I would like to prove the existence of the phenomena by providing more specific and technical data. Please answer in detail. What would be considered PROOF?

Please answer and send me two copies of your answer.

Sincerely yours,

Department of the Air Force

Transcription of the text in the document:

Knoxville, Tennessee
30 NOV 63

The night of November 29th (1963) a 
experimental helicopter with the pilot were seen over 
the town of Greenback, Tennessee, about 25 miles southwest 
of Knoxville, Tennessee. The two distinctive lights were 
described as looking like a helicopter, but are believe to be some new 
of aircraft which looked like a helicopter take a 45 
degree turn at near 2,000 feet and then flew off in a straight 
line with a tail or 1st speed over 2,000 
then at 12 airline miles back over Knoxville at 33,000 feet
flying over Knoxville at 33,000 feet at the same
time.
