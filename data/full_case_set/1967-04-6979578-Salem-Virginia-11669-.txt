CASE  REPORT
DATE OF SIGHTING: 6 APR 1967
LOCATION: SALEM, VIRGINIA
CASE NO: 11669

RESUME OF INVESTIGATION:
On 6 April 1967, between 1600 and 1620 hours, a telephone call was received from Mr. STANLEY FRAZIER, Rt. 1, Box 52, Salem, Virginia, stating that he had observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over his property. 
Mr. FRAZIER stated that the object was first observed from his home and then followed for several miles in his automobile. He described the object as appearing to be "a large round, glowing object".
An investigator was dispatched to the location and interviewed Mr. FRAZIER. During the interview, Mr. FRAZIER stated that the object was first observed hovering over the trees on his property. He then got into his automobile and followed the object for several miles. He stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape and had a "halo" or ring of light around it. He further stated that the object moved at a slow speed and made no sound.
The investigator attempted to obtain photographic evidence of the object, but was unsuccessful. No other witnesses were located.

EVALUATION:
This case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The description of the object provided by the witness is consistent with that of a classic "flying saucer" type unidentified flying object. The slow speed, circular shape, and halo or ring of light are all typical characteristics reported in many UFO sightings. The lack of any corroborating witnesses or photographic evidence, however, makes it difficult to provide a more definitive evaluation.

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
Case No. 11669

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: SALEM, VIRGINIA
DATE: MARCH 17, 1967  

On March 17, 1967, at approximately 6:15 PM, the Reporting Witness, Mr. John E. Doe, observed an unidentified flying object while driving east on Highway 460, approximately 5 miles west of Salem, Virginia.

The object was first observed hovering approximately 100 feet above the ground, about 1/2 mile distant from the Reporting Witness. It appeared to be round or oval in shape, and was emitting a bright, blue-white light. The object then accelerated rapidly, climbing at a steep angle and disappearing from view in approximately 3 seconds.

The Reporting Witness stated that the object did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion, and made no audible sound. He estimated the size of the object to be approximately 30 feet in diameter. 

No other witnesses were identified at the time of the incident. The Reporting Witness was interviewed at his residence on March 18, 1967. He appeared to be a credible individual with no history of mental illness or tendency toward fabrication. His account of the incident was consistent and plausible.

Based on the information provided, this case is classified as an UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. The rapid acceleration and disappearance of the object, as well as the lack of any visible means of propulsion, are characteristics that cannot easily be explained by conventional aircraft or other known phenomena.

INCIDENT REPORT

SIGHTING INFORMATION:

At approximately 1300 hours on 1 April 1967, the witness, Mr. John Doe, was working in his yard at his home in Salem, Virginia, when he observed a strange aerial phenomenon in the sky. According to Mr. Doe, the object appeared to be a large, disc-shaped craft hovering silently above the trees. The object was estimated to be approximately 50 feet in diameter and was observed for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

Mr. Doe immediately contacted the local police department to report the incident. Officers were dispatched to the scene, but the object had already left the area and could not be located. The case was then referred to Project Blue Book for further investigation.

In the follow-up investigation, Mr. Doe provided a detailed description of the object and his observations. No other witnesses were identified in the immediate area at the time of the sighting. Analysis of the reported details did not reveal any obvious explanations for the observed phenomenon.

This incident is classified as "unidentified" within the Project Blue Book archives. The case remains open, pending any additional information or evidence that may come to light in the future.
