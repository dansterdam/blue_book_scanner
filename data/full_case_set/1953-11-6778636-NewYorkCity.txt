(Circle One) (Yes) No
37.1 If you answered NO, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?

38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
I have no idea but the brightness of the light and the precision in which it moved across the horizon lead me to believe it was some type of machine operated by intelligent beings rather than any natteral phenomena. It could fail to appear through the clouds at once and could be seen again instantly indicating that it was under intelligent control. It may be that such visitations are military test flights, secret experiments or some other classified phenomena but I do not feel that it was my duty to report it to the authorities since I only caught a brief glimpse and was unsure of the significance or what I had witnessed.

The text in the document describes an observation made by the individual, including details about the sighting of an unidentified aerial phenomenon. It mentions that the object was seen at 3 o'clock in the morning, described as clear, shiny and metallic in appearance, and that it was stationary for a period of time before moving off rapidly. The observer expresses their belief that the object was not a conventional aircraft.

My father, the late Doctor Frederick Phillips, was born in Brittain, but spent most of his life as an American citizen. For forty-seven years in this city, his life was the history of the American harassing. Beginning in 1900 the supreme court of the UnitedStates handed down a decision in the Philippine cases including private practice rounded out over forty years.

My father and both grandparents were born in Britain but Griffith my sister was born in this country. We were under the Governor Winthrop expedition to Boston as officer who obtained under General Sir Thomas Donaldson. His children were obliged to preach to Britain as a rule and they complied -- one of the family at least and perhaps more became quite prominent clergymen in England.

I tell you this so you may know of our loyalty, and that my motive in sending this is one of helpfulness. And to you, I can be of any further help I shall be so glad

Doctor Roeser, who succeeded my father as chief of surgery at the hospital where they served, has known me over twenty-three years and my brother, Mr. TWC, was manager of the 44th branch of the American Trust Company. Perhaps you know him. Doctor Roeser is one of the heads of the department of surgery. There are a few of the family friends I feel sure you will vouch for me.

Commanding Officer
Department of Aviation
Washington, D. C.

Sir:

Three weeks ago next Tuesday not being able to sleep I sat facing the East as I often do and to my left in the line of vision where I have a very clear view of the Hudson and the Jersey shore between the French building to the left on 5th Ave and the corner of 45th St and Madison Ave, where the Ritz-Carlton formerly stood.

Suddenly a fading circle of light about the size of a large dinner plate and much lighter than a star, though it seemed to be illuminating the surface or the river was seen. It seemed to be floating very clear out seemed to be moving very slowly as it moved along the surface of the river.

It was not a falling star sort of medium size like the things I had seen described in papers as unidentified flying objects.

THE RECCRDE T AIRCRAFT DATA SHEET

OR PORTION OF A REPORT WHICH I HAVE JUST SEEN
THE WITNESSES' NAMES WOULD INDICATE SOMETHING AUTHENTIC
FOR THIS REPORT. I BELIEVE IT CAME UP AS IF THE SIGHTING
WERE AUTHENTIC AND NOT IF THE CAUSE WERE CR"l WITH
RELATION THERETO.

I HAVE CHECKED THE IS OF FLYING SAUCERS UP TO THIS TIME I KNOW OF THE KNOWN. MOST OF THEM I CAN GO ALONG WITH AS FAR SOUTH AS THE NATIVE SOVIET UNION - THEIR LANGUAGE, ETC. - BUT I SPEAK AS THE NATIVE SOVIET UNION UNTIL THE CRAFT BECOMES "OR AND ROUND" IN THE SHAPE THAT I AM FAMILIAR WITH - THEN I THINK IT IS REAL AS I WOULD WISH TO KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM. THE NORTH IS CLOSE BY WHERE I SPEAK AS THE NATIVE SOVIET UNION.

MY FATHER AND BROTHER WERE BOTH SERVICEMEN AT ONE OF THE OUTLYING STATIONS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE LONG-LAND WHERE I LIVED. I HAVE GIVEN YOU ALL THE DETAILS I CAN IN FAIR JUSTICE TO MYSELF. I WILL BE MOST INTERESTED TO LEARN OF YOUR FINDINGS.

AS I WOULD WISH TO DO SOMETHING POSSIBLE FOR SOME ONE DEAR TO ME, I AM WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE IF ANY ONE WOULD CARE TO HEAR MY EXPERIENCES. I AM SURE THERE ARE MANY WHO WILL VOUCH FOR MY INTEGRITY.

PLEASE FOR GIVE MY TARDY REPLY AS THE REASON WHY DOES NOT PERMIT ME TO ANSWER SOONER FOR THE PRESENT.

Your Sincerely;

The text provided in the document, as extracted by an OCR system, is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

I HAVE GIVEN THE VERY BEST DRAWING I CAN OF THE MOTION OF THE OBJECT. IT WAS MOVING IN SOME KIND OF FLIGHT PATTERN WHICH I WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE DEFINITELY. IT WAS MAKING QUITE RAPID BUT ERRATIC MOTIONS AND I COULDN'T DRAW ANY CONSISTENT LINE OF TRAVEL. AT ONE POINT IT APPEARED TO GO INTO A VERTICAL CLIMB, BUT I AM NOT SURE.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was, in its longest dimension.
Feet: APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand:
(Circle One): a. Head of a pin b. Nickel c. Dime d. Nickel e. Quarter f. Half dollar g. Silver dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22:) a. Certain b. Fairly certain c. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects first become visible to you? How did they disappear from view?
The object first became visible to me as a small bright spot in the sky. It then began to grow larger and I could see it was some form of aircraft, but I am unable to describe it definitely. It then made a series of rapid, erratic motions and then appeared to go into a vertical climb and disappeared from view.

24. In order that we can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would you give it? How would the same appearance as the object which you saw?
I would not know just what kind of material to use to construct an object like the one I saw. It did not appear to be of any known aircraft design or construction that I am familiar with. It was approximately 30 feet in size and seemed to be a circular or disc-shaped object, though I could not be certain of the exact shape. It appeared to be metallic in nature, but I have no idea what kind of metal might have been used. The surface seemed to reflect light, giving it a shiny or luminous appearance at times.

- page 12 -

The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows how high an object was above the horizon (skyline) when it was first seen. The second and third sketches show the position of the object when it was first seen ("A") and another position ("B") when it was seen again later.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
