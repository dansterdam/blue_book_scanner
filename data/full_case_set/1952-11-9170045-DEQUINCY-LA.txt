OCR TEXT OUTPUT:
"...in could be seen a large , round bright object. This object was observed for several minutes and was approximately fifty to one hundred feet in diameter and moving at a very high rate of speed. The object was first observed going in a westerly direction and then changed direction and headed north. The object was very high in the sky and was seen by a total of three people in this area at approximately the same time. No sound was heard in connection with the object. The night was very clear and the object was clearly visible in the bright moonlight.

The information contained herein was obtained through interviews with the witnesses, T/Sgt. XXXXX and A1/C XXXXX, conducted on 9 November 1952. It should be noted that the Air Force investigator's official report on this sighting seems to agree with the statements of the witnesses."

INFORMATION 

IR-179-52
DeQuincy, La. 
Nov 29, 1952

Intelligence, Lakes Charles Airbase.
Dear Sir:

Last night between 8:15 and 8:30 I walked out on my front porch and saw a light coming towards me. (My house faces East and is in the upper-east north-east corner of DeQuincy, La. The house next door behind me.) The light was very bright and moving, resembling the red light of an aircraft descending. The light seemed to just hang in the air just over the roof of the house next door. As I moved closer for a closer observation the light took on the appearance of the arrow-shaped object with two colors on the outside rim, green and reddish-pink.  

I called the family and told my husband to go to town and tell some one else, but didn't tell him to call the base as I didn't know if the observers he showed it to did so either. Getting back to what I saw - It seemed to just hang there for a period of time and then it made what seemed to be a sharp, quick turn and headed in a south westerly direction. It's speed was tremendous - just about as fast as I could observe it going away. That was the last I saw of the object. After he left, I gathered by daughter-in-law's thoughts. She had joined me and supposed to be watching. She had turned to go back in the house when she saw it coming and missed observing it leave. 

The parachute shape of the object was reddish-pink but the large vertical thing was a red or orange glow, it would be hard to say which color, as it did not seem to give off any definite light. Other times it seems like it had taken an altitude and it was a huge object judging by the size, just as the glow would change color and shape. 

This is the only report I have given of an object and don't intend to inform anyone else unless this should be required.

The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon (skyline) and an object above it, with instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when first seen. The second and third sketches depict a person walking down a road, with the third sketch showing the road leading to the horizon.

As an OCR system, the text in the document is as follows:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
