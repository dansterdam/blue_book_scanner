The Thing, 10 Feet Tall, Terrifies Party of 7

Sutton, W. Va., Sept. 14 (UP)—A housewife swore today that she and six boys saw “an evil-smelling fire-breathing monster, 10 feet tall, with a bright green body and blood-red face,” on a hillside near here.

Mrs. Kathleen May of Flatwood, her four children Freddy of eleven included, and six from her experiments said she and the boys, (including, 17-year-old National Guardsman, investigating Friday night who made the first reports) that a flying saucer had landed. She said she, her sons Gene, 13, and Fred, 12, and Neil Nunley, 14, Ronnie Shaver, 10, and Tommy Hyer, also 10, all went to the hill here Friday night.

Persons who were smothering unaware said the hiding move in a tree, and when the lone flashlight on it was shone aimed at the tree, he saw the 10-foot "thing" with the flushed face and icy green body that “seemed to glow.”

Mrs. May and Tom Lemon were the interior and fall backward as the monster dawalked toward them and the whole party turned and ran. She said the monster exuded an overpowering odor that so sickened them they vomited for hours afterward.

SUMMARY (Entire concise summary report. Only difference from the final presentation paragraph. Link evidence at lower left. Begin text of report on AF Form 112—Part III) 

Shamokin,
Pa., Mrs. ______ reported seeing two unidentified flying
objects at approximately 2000Z, on on 6 September, the
other on 8 September 1952.

At least twenty miles W.N.W. two objects appeared to be the same
or if in a hovering cluster, are described This is cigar-shaped
with the "base" or "tail" of the "cigar" about as observable
was observed for only a few seconds sometime between 2000 and
2100Z at a point East of her position. It was reported to
have moved in a straight line toward the South and disappeared.

The second object sighted at 1605Z on 9 September was ob-
served for two or three minutes. It also appeared in the East
and moved hurriedly South, but reversed its course after
traveling "four or five miles" and returned the same
path toward the East and then "west up" and disappeared.
Lairman claimed the speed of the object was "very fast", but
her description of the distance it traveled indicates either
that its speed was slower than she thought or that the time of
the observation was shorter than she believed.

The weather at the time of both observations was clear.

These observations were verified by Mrs. _____ and _____
who were originally enlisted in the identification of both
objects.

The technique is, initially to give the QCM the most reliable
operations must be impossible to determine the exact nature
of these objects, but joint interest and astrophysical phenomena
remain strong possibilities.

Dear Sirs

I am writing to you tell what I saw last Fall about
last days of September one night when visiting to my friends
when returning home. About 10:30 p.m. a flying object or
they call a flying discos. This flying object came down
within 50 feet from the car on this road, about 25 feet
height of the ground. It haded a light and it stood about
60 seconds in one place and it move away and it turns its
light off when it took off, This object was big and round
with a nickel plated rim around edge of this object. I
should of wrote you this before but I never did get around

Dear Mr. K n s k i t:

Thank you for your personal expression of interest in behalf
of Mr. 's group, Shamokin, Kulpmont, Kase-Wisn, concerning "Flying
Saucers."

For Mr. 's assurance, I am enclosing a May so that
he will have the full picture of our activities in this matter to
date.

As may be noted from this report, the Air Force has received
a number of reports from credible observers which cannot be
explained at this time. However, our investigations of unusual
aerial phenomena have produced nothing which confirms any
reports, and we understand as rare is known about occurrences in
the upper atmosphere.

The Air Force appreciates Mr. 's Interest in reporting
his observation. You will want to know that his report has been
made a matter of record and is being evaluated by the Air Forces.
In the event additional information on this matter is required,
an Air Force representative will communicate with Mr.

LUMINOUS OBJECT SEEN OVER MALLORCA -- Tangier, Espana, 4 Sep 52  
REFER TO CASE: 16 Jul 52, 'Operation Crossroad Case'  

On 3 September 1952, late at night, four professors of the Seraphic Seminary in Palma, Mallorca Island, noticed a luminous disk in the sky, traveling from west to east. They said that it could not have been a shooting star and that they were giving the report as objectively as possible in its barest details to provide another item for the study of the flying saucer phenomenon.

TWO METEOROLOGISTS SEE SAUCERS IN UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA. -- Oran, L'Echo d'Oran, 8 Sep 52

__Pere< To Can<e: 'N. JLSz> T>Ri<.aT T<r< . M<r?__

On the morning of 6 September 1952, a meteorologist was taking weather observations in Durban, Union of South Africa, when he saw a white object moving smoothly across his field of vision. After two more had appeared and passed in the same manner, he called a coworker, with whom he observed three more saucers. He was able to follow one of them with a theodolite, which indicated that the object was at a high altitude. It had about the same shape as a weather balloon which was then at an altitude of only 3,500 meters. The spherical objects appeared to be at an altitude above 6,500 meters.

Both men have been meteorologists for some time (the second man is the director of the weather bureau at Natal). Their information was written into the records of the local meteorological office.
