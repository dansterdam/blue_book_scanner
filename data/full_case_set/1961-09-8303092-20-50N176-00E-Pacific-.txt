San Francisco, California

The text in the document states:
"The object, according to Mrs. Mae Harold of San Francisco, was a cylindrical shape, yellow color and approximately three feet long and two feet in diameter. It was observed for about five minutes at approximately 10:00 p.m. on the night of 2 September 1961. According to Mrs. Harold, the object was hovering about 25 feet above the ground and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view in about ten seconds. No sound was heard."

Text extracted from the document:

Jupiter Dazzles the Eye 
Jupiter is a brilliant star in September. Seen in Sagittarius, the archer, it stands high in the south.
Look toward the north. The great planet Venus is now high in the west, fainter than Jupiter but still very bright. Saturn, too, is in the western sky, but he is now low, gradually being overtaken by the sun's light.
At the lower right of the map is a legend describing symbols for the order of brightness of celestial objects.

OCR output:

NO CASE (Information Only)	3 September 1962
San Francisco, California

The sighting of a strange aerial phenomenon occurred over the Pacific Ocean approximately 300 miles west of San Francisco, California. It was visible for nearly 3 hours and was observed by a number of aircraft in the area. It was described as a bright light, possibly a flare, drifting over the area and then hovering in the sky. The object remained stationary in the sky for over an hour, then split into two parts and moved off rapidly in opposite directions. No sound was heard and no trail was left behind. The object was observed by several aircraft crews and they will be evaluated more thoroughly.

The image contains two maps. The larger map depicts the position of Jupiter in the night sky, indicating that Jupiter is nearly 20 times as bright as a first magnitude star in September. The smaller map shows the relative positions and brightness of various stars and celestial objects in the northeast portion of the sky. There are no photographs present in this document.

ASTRONOMY
SCIENCE NEWS LETTER FOR AUGUST 26, 1961

Jupiter Dazzles the Eye

Jupiter is nearly 20 times as bright as a first magnitude star in September. Seen in Sagittarius, the archer, it stands in the middle, next to Saturn.

Italian astronomers report Galileo Galilei
noticed its great brightness centuries ago. He
thought, at first, that it was a fixed star, but soon
discovered it was a planet. It was one of the first
to be found revolving around the Sun, like the
Earth.

Jupiter is the largest of the planets and five
times as large as the Earth. Its glare is surpassed
only by the Sun and Moon. The planet reflects light
rather well and this adds to its brilliance.

Careful observers can, at certain times, make
out the four Galilean satellites, the large moons
named after the Italian astronomer. At this time
they appear as tiny pinpricks of light, strung out
on either side of the giant planet. Binoculars will
bring them into better view.

Celestial Stands Low in Northeast

Around this time of year, the constellations of the northern sky have reached their lowest point for the night. Arcturus, the bright orange star in Bootes, the herdsman, and Vega, a first magnitude star marking the head of the small constellation Lyra, the harp, have dropped to within a few degrees of the northeast horizon at their lowest point.

And low in the north in Pegasus, the winged horse, is the Square, one of the most conspicuous star groupings in the sky. To the west, two other first magnitude stars, Altair and Deneb, are setting lower, completing the diamond figure which is so frequently seen in mid-autumn skies.
