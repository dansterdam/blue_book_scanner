Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear Sirs,
We are certainly at a loss to account for the strange light that was observed in the sky over (deleted) Pennsylvania on the night of (deleted). The light was observed by several persons and was seen to be moving slowly across the sky at approximately 10:00 PM. The light was described as being disc-shaped and emitting a bright glow. It was observed for approximately 15 minutes before disappearing from view. Several attempts were made to photograph the object, but none of the attempts were successful. We can only conclude that the object was some type of unidentified flying object, as we are unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for what was observed.
Yours truly,
(deleted)
