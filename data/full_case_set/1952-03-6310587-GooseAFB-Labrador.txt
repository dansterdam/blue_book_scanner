This document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report regarding vapor trails observed over Goose Air Base in Labrador on March 12, 1952.

The text of the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED
AF FORM 112--PART 1   
COUNTRY: USA-MATS
REPORT NO: IR-103-52
SUBJECT: AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
VAPOR TRAILS OVER GOOSE AIR BASE, LABRADOR
LOCATION: GOOSE AIR BASE, LABRADOR  
DATE OF INCIDENT: 12 MARCH 1952
CONTROL: Capt W. C. Matthews
SUMMARY: 
1. MATS instructor pilot, Flight "D", 6th Air Rescue Squadron, flying NEAC C-47, type at 6,000 feet over Goose Air Base, observed vapor trails forming during the flight. According to the sighting, the trails were narrow, formed into a serpentine pattern, and were at a very high altitude and in a northeasterly direction over Goose Air Base.  
2. Captain Matthews immediately reported the incident to Goose Air Base tower operations, but had no knowledge of any aircraft in the area other than the local aircraft he was working at the time.
3. Source added that there was no doubt in his mind that the vapor trails were real, as he had seen them often while flying in Europe during World War II.
4. The sighting of the vapor trails was confirmed by Major R. Hange, pilot of the aircraft.
