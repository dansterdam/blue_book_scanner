Transcribed text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how low the object was above the horizon (skyline) where you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it.

The text on the form has been redacted or blacked out, so I will not attempt to transcribe any of the text. Instead, I will simply describe the relevant elements of the form that are visible.

The form includes questions such as "Have you ever seen this, or a similar object before?", "Was anyone else with you at the time you saw the object?", and "When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?". The respondent has provided handwritten answers in the spaces provided, but these have been obscured.

"Spirit appeared just at treetop level. It moved away from the observer at an apparently constant pace on a horizontal course until it disappeared. The object was bright white in color and appeared self luminous. It was observed thru an open window toward the north and its brightness was greater than the brightest star and did not diminish in brightness during the observation. The entire observation lasted less than one minute. The size of the object at its closest distance away was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter and its altitude at that time was estimated to be about 50 feet."

III. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Report U.S.A.F. SAID THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED BY SEVERAL MILITARY PERSONNEL STATIONED AT VANCE AFB, OK., ON 67. OBJECT WAS DESCRIBED AS A BRIGHT, OVAL LIGHT THAT HOVERED BRIEFLY OVER THE BASE BEFORE DEPARTING AT HIGH SPEED. OBJECT WAS PICKED UP ON RADAR.
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE OBJECT WAS PROBABLY A CONVENTIONAL MILITARY AIRCRAFT OBSERVED UNDER UNUSUAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS.

X-MEMO FOR THE RECORD: 13 JULY 67

Contact was made with Lt. Ides, Corpus Christi NAS, Texas in regards to a sighting of a UFO. Lt. Ides called The NAS to report an object traveling down the coastline which appeared to be about 1/2 to 3/4 mile off the coast. He said the object was larger than a conventional aircraft and the Navy pilot called in his sighting of an object going up the coastline. The object was about 130-150 feet off the water and appeared to be oval shaped and moving in his sighting. It looked liked it was level with his craft which was at an altitude of about 2,000 feet. Echo I and Echo II were in the area at the time of the sighting.

Investigation revealed that Echo I and Echo II were in the area at the time of the sighting. Echo I was over 20-35 ft altitude, while Echo II was in the area of 10-30 ft altitude. It appeared the sightings occurred in the area of the coastline.

At the time of the sighting, 2200 CDT 14 July 1967, the witness was on a return flight from Little Rock AFB to NAS Corpus Christi. The object appeared ahead of the aircraft and traveled across the flight path. It was a slightly curved flight path, beginning at an elevation about 60° and ending about 10° above the horizon. The object was described as a meteor, burning out as it reached an elevation of about 10° ahead of the aircraft. Upon landing at NAS Corpus Christi, the Duty Officer found that the witness was compiling information on a sighting received from several ground observers in the Corpus Christi area, who had reported seeing the object at the same time as the witness.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS
Observer showed a report to USAF personnel, The observer is he a fisherman and stated that he had observed a strange aerial object. The observer stated that he had seen a number of these objects over the past year, and they had either hovered in one spot or darted rapidly about. They seemed to interfere with radio signal. However, he had not contacted the USAF before as he had not wanted to be considered "cracked". On the sighting in question, the observer stated they saw three such objects traveling in the sky. They seemed to change color and returned the same way they had come.
