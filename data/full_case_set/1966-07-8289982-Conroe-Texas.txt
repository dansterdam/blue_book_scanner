The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book record dated July 7, 1966, reporting a UFO sighting that occurred in Conroe, Texas. The text on the document describes the details of the sighting, including the number of objects observed, the length of the observation, the type of observation (ground visual), the course, and the physical evidence. The document indicates that photos were taken, but it is not clear if any photos are included in this particular record.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was the US Air Force's systematic study of unidentified flying objects.

Transcription of the text from the document:

"January 4, 19XX

1 - Estimated elevation - X?
2 - Estimated speed - X?
3 - Estimated size - X?
4 - Estimated direction - XXX
5 - Missile?

Each object appeared to have a blinking light, varying in intensity and color was dim in nature. Objects appeared to be in formation and executed maneuvers or changes in speed and direction. Objects disappeared quickly from view.

My observation may have been only a small part of a larger unknown incident, but felt should be reported as requested per Project Blue Book requirements."

Jan. 29, 1964
6:30 p.m.
The clear, moon 3/4.
The air was calm, air temp cooler and cooler as the evening wore on. I went outside and noticed a bright light in the S.E. sky, very bright, like Venus or some star. It definitely was moving. I changed my position to get a better view and could see it was moving like a plane, but much faster and very bright. The light did some zigging and zagging and increased in speed. It seemed to go out of sight behind some trees. I went inside and watched through a window, but could not see it again. It could not have been a planet or a star. I have seen a number of satellites and this was definitely not a satellite. It was an unidentified flying object.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows handwritten text on a page, which I will now transcribe:

I just want to say this has been a strange experience, to say the least. This object appeared to be around 3,000 to 5,000 feet high and was hovering near Conroe, Texas.

The object appeared to be around 50 to 60 feet in diameter and was lighted from the inside. The color varied from orange to reddish orange.

After I was over practically the same area, further watched the object and noted it appeared to be pendulum like in motion.

They only thing unusual, other than the object itself, was that when I approached to get a better look, the object seemed to move away from me. I watched it for approximately 15 minutes and then it disappeared - seemed to just fade out.

A report is being made of this sighting, and I will be glad to give any officials at Tinker AFB or elsewhere any further details that could be of help.

That is the essence of what occurred.

Gentlemen:

On the night of July 7, 1966, I had the occasion with two other boys to see an unidentified flying object.

At approximately 10:00 P.M. I saw a bright light off in the distance and thought at first to be just a bright star. But as I watched it, the light became larger. I called attention to the object. We could see it clearly since we were out in the middle of Grand Lake in a canoe. We watched it and as the light got brighter, we heard a low hum. The louder it came, the brighter it became; then the light seemed to go out.

It never at any time became unbearable. This hum was not the noise of an aircraft, jet or helicopter. I know that definitely! As it started to the left of us, we could see the red lights. The lights were in a semi-circle pattern. It never stopped; the lights stayed on, not blinking, the low hum getting fainter as it traveled.
