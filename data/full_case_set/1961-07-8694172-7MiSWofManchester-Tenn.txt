The objects were first sighted at 1850 local time, moving from south to north at a high rate of speed, then stopping and hovering for several minutes. The objects then continued on a northerly course at a high rate of speed, maintaining a straight course. The objects, which were silver in color and appeared to have no wings or tail surfaces, were observed through binoculars and a telescope. The observers stated that the objects were larger than commercial aircraft and the light reflected from them was intense. No sound was heard. The observation lasted approximately 5 minutes.
