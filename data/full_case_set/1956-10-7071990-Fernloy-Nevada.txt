APPROXIMATELY 3,000 YARDS DIRECTLY OFF THE HIGHWAY AND APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OVER A SMALL HILL. IT ESTIMATED THE HEIGHT OF THE HILL, IS [REDACTED] FEET, THE ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT TO BE 5,000 TO 7,000 FEET, HOWEVER, THE OBSERVER ESTIMATED THIS ESTIMATE WAS ONLY A GOOD GUESS. SHORTLY AFTER SIGHTED OUT OF HIS SIGHT TO BETTER OBSERVE THE OBJECT, IF CONTINUED TRAVELING IN A NORTHEAST DIRECTION AT EXCEPTIONAL HIGH SPEED. IT APPEARED TO BE WELL DEFINED AND SOLID LIKE METAL. IT ALSO TRIED TO FOCUS HIS BINOCULARS ON THE OBJECT AND GET A MUCH CLEARER SIGHTING. IT WAS THROUGH THIS STUDY THAT HE DETERMINED THE OBJECT TO BE CIGAR-SHAPED AND SAID HE OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE OPENINGS OR APERTURES ON THE FUSELAGE BUT DUE TO THE RAPID SPEED OF MOVEMENT, HE COULD NOT GET AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF SUCH OPENINGS. ACCORDING TO HIS ESTIMATE, THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE FLYING FROM A DISTANCE OF 329 TO 352 MILES AND ACCELERATED RAPIDLY TO A TREMENDOUS SPEED ABOUT 3 OR 4 MINUTES FROM THE START OF SIGHTING UNTIL THE OBJECT WAS OUT OF SIGHT APPROXIMATELY 7 TO 10 SECONDS ELAPSED. OBJECT TRAVELED ON A LEVEL COURSE AT A CONSTANT HEADED SPEED, CUT OF SIGHT. [REDACTED]

Text extracted from the document:

AND HE HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY HOVERING ABOVE STATION,MON-DAYS UNTIL THEY ARE APPROACHED TO LAND.WHEN AAPPROACHED TO LAND THIS UFO IMMEDIATELY GAINS SPEED AND AGAIN CLIMBED TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION. THIS SIRE SIGHTING WAS AGAIN MADE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF FERNLEY,NEVADA. ALTHOUGH THE ESTIMATED ALTITUDE AND VEHICLE DESCRIPTION OF THIS PROJECT LEAVES NUMEROUS UNANSWERED QUESTIONS, THE FACT THAT THIS OBJECT HAS OBSERVED PERIODICALLY IN FRONT AND THEN BEHIND SITE OBSERVERS IN THE COVER OF TRAVELING 30 MILES, DOES TO INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF IDENTIFICATION IN A TERM INTERESTED BY UNUSUAL AERIAL CONDITIONS. IN THE ABSENCE OF ADDITIONAL IDENTIFYING OR CORROBORATING DATA ON THIS SIGHTING, NO DETERMINATION AS TO POSSIBLE OR PROBABLE CAUSE CAN BE MADE AT THIS LEVEL.
