The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text.

The text on the page reads as follows:

14. Date you completed this questionnaire: March 10 1965
15. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or narrative explanation of your sighting:

After a careful analysis of the data at hand, my observations are that the object observed on the night of March 5, 1965 was a saucer-shaped craft, due to its ability to hover steady and then accelerate at a speed which was much faster than any known aircraft in existence. I cannot state categorically that it was an interplanetary spacecraft, but the object seemed to exhibit characteristics which are more in keeping with an extraterrestrial craft than any known terrestrial aircraft. The object remained in my field of vision for a period of approximately 2-3 minutes and then accelerated to a speed greatly in excess of any jet aircraft, disappearing from view within a few seconds. I am quite convinced that the object was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, satellite, or any other known aerial device. While I cannot state positively that it was of extraterrestrial origin, the performance characteristics exhibited by the object were such that I am strongly inclined to believe that it was not of this world. I am quite certain that my observation was not the product of any hallucination or mistaken identification. The object was clearly visible and I have no doubt as to the reality of what I witnessed.

The provided image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document or report, likely part of Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page includes questions and responses related to an observed object, such as whether it disappeared, moved behind something, or moved in front of something. The respondent has provided written answers to these questions.

Here is the text transcribed from the image:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
Circo-Circo

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?
Yese, No,    Don't know.
If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind:
Circo Circo

18. Do you wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil at arm's length in line with the known object and note how much of the object it covers. Then tell us the number of degrees this way: 
(Please give your best estimate) 
Seemed about 6-8 feet in diameter at estimated 1/2 mile distance. This matches previous estimates I've made at times of similar UFO observation.  

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details which will help clarify the drawing, such as direction of movement, size in comparison to known objects, etc.
Place an arrow to indicate the direction the object was moving.
