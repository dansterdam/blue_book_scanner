Dear Bob,

Everything is fine with the flying saucers. Have made one TDY trip to southwestern with Capt Quintanilla regarding UFO's.
A committee of three graduate students has been formed at Northwestern to investigate 1963 sightings. In some way we might come up with some area where the Air Force falls short either in investigations or evaluations.
I have enclosed some of the cases from Jan 1963 where there is some differences in opinion as to the cause of the sightings. Perhaps a note from you might enlighten us. Now I will see if your pupil learns this lesson (that's me).
Played a team game with Dan as partner and John Dooley as opponents; we managed to finish 3rd. Believe claims Dooley kicked six benders. I was busy scoring and didn't get a chance to score.
I am working at Sears' three nights a week, so the budget is confined to Sunday games.
Saw Jacoby in the Cincinnati regional; he sends his regards.

Hope everything is going well for you and the family. Give my regards to June.

Sincerely,

[Redacted signature]

Dear Sir:

Your letter and I own and operate a small radio telescope in Nantucket Point out there in Montauk, Long Island, N.Y.

Do you have and can I send you the results of our activity, necessarily not to transmit and use what information I may learn if any about our position and what goes on. I'm not in a good position to send you and learn from you as well and as far as I can see no need to know about experiments in that level.

Nancy

To me, and I guess the lead house to a lot of people in town, the appearance of this object was quite startling and I would say it had a couple of characteristics that distinguish it from a lot of other things that they might describe. For one, it was sailing along very smoothly without any apparent motion of it's own. And the second thing that distinguished it was the fact that it cast no shadow which is something that arouses a bit of curiosity. I would say its size in comparison to something as large as a house may have been one third that size. I would estimate its height to be about 300 feet. And it's passage across the sky was somewhat diagonal in direction rather than straight across the horizon. I had a chance to view it for maybe 15 to 20 seconds before it disappeared in the direction of the ocean. And considering the speed it was traveling it seemed to fade out in the distance rather than suddenly vanished from sight. So those are the principal characteristics of the object that come to mind. Its journey was abrupt, in and out in a matter of seconds, and that perhaps is what most distinguishes it from the usual run of such celestial phenomena.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Wanted aspects a series of events, flying object and manoeuvres, all directions, no more than 2 minutes. At first lower down than before, not more than 2 or 3 feet, than go up again to an estimate level of 50 to 75 feet.
The object be steady no sign of any propeller or jets. Slowed as if motionless, then a sudden burst away in a direction almost straight up for maybe, may be three quarters of a mile. Then stopped, hesitated for a few seconds and moved slowly back over the same path.
There are 3 or 4 other persons who saw the object of the night with me and I have talked to them, they got the feeling of strangeness and wonder like I did. It was a bright object, much brighter than a star, almost like full moon size. We watched and watched until it disappeared from view, may be over 300 yards away, one of the most unusual sightings I have ever witness.
I did not hear any sound, and the object itself should have made some sound if it was mechanical. The object did not blur or flicker in anyway and the size seemed to remain the same. This is a well established fact and I did not want this to be overlooked.

On this page of the Project Blue Book document, the text reads:

"On the night of the 25th of January 1963, a bright flash of light, apparently from an object descending almost vertically, was observed at Nantucket Point on Long Island, New York. The object was detected on a radar scope which showed it to be moving very rapidly, disappearing and reappearing at intervals of about 1/2 second. This happened around 9:50 PM. When Officer Murphy of the Nantucket Point Police Department went to investigate, the object had already disappeared. He could not find any trace of it. According to his report, the object was seen by several other people in the general direction of where he saw the flash. As it was getting dark, he could not make out any definite shape or size. He said the flash was of short duration, perhaps 1-2 seconds, and was very bright, lighting up the entire area for a moment. The experience and his only remark have were, 'I've never seen anything like that before.' If there are any other witnesses, we should be glad to hear from them and this information could be very helpful. Also, if there are any other incidents we should know about, please let us know, as we believe you could contribute greatly to this study."

Thank you for the attention.

U.S. Air Force
Intelligence Bureau

Dear Sirs,

My wife and I own and operate a small motel here at Nantucket Point on the tip of Long Island, New York. We operate under another name and number, and in winter occasionally send to transient workers or personnel working at one of your radar installations here at Point.

The Long Island Rail Road has its last station here about 3/4 mile from here. Adjacent to the "Republic Aeroplane" has a small warehouse installation.

A Mr. ________, who works for the L.I.R.R. on car maintenance, and who resides here with his wife, came to me with a strange story one morning. 

Incidentally this young man has been with us about 3 weeks, is a good worker, sober and as far as I can see, reliable.

His story about the elusive "flying saucer." I myself here never seen one and probably never will in the foreseeable future. Mr. _________ talked about it to me, and I gauged he had seen a "cloud of something", an illusion or reflection--another fleeting glimpse, unstable vision or hallucination; but when he said he had this paper-thin discs close to above him for about a whole hour; then I was amazed.

Mr. _________ was on the night shift beginning Jan 4th 7:30 p.m. to dawn of Jan 5th. He was busy filling the tanks on the train at about 3 a.m. of Jan 5--when upon his way down, with a guided gasoline tender car to near and then. The engine are constantly in warm-up, so any sounds the object could have made were deadened.

He happened to look up from his work, and hovering above him at what he estimated to be about 100 feet was this craft, as he described it, perfectly round, in thickness, like two saucers placed against one another, thicker in the middle and tapering toward the edge.

Because of the moonlight and the clearness of the night, the shining metal structure was clearly visible. On top of the object, in the center, was a plume of bright blue light, like an exhaust of some sort.

He estimated it to be about 75 feet across its diameter. Every once in a while it would execute a series of runs (?) , dips and maneuvers in all directions, at times at terrific speeds close to the ground, but never lower than about 900 feet."

He said he saw no signs of any ports (?) or windows or lighting on it, outside of the blue light on top.

There does not appear to be a photograph or image included in this scanned document. The document appears to be a typed report describing an incident involving a "craft" being observed and a close encounter experienced by the witness. The report contains detailed descriptions of the incident and the witness's reactions, but does not include any visual imagery.

(Continued) Ltr. Mr. [REDACTED] to USAF Intelligence Bureau

Mr. [REDACTED] said, he got the feeling that this "craft" was watching him, or the whole operation. Suddenly another 200 yards away / one of the lights outside his house started moving, and the craft slid over in that direction and hovered over that area for a while until the guard was seen to look up at the sky, but chances are the lights of the building blinded him. It is not known yet whether any of the guards there saw anything that night. Mr. [REDACTED] does not know any of the men working guard duty at the moment.

Finally, after about an hour of maneuvering, (at times he felt it was so close, it seemed you could almost reach out and touch it) an air-liner or large jet of some sort was headed by, and just as the plane, flying at about 15,000 feet, arrived overhead, this craft zoomed straight up at a terrific speed, and this happened so fast that there would be a crash, but it seemed to swerve off at the last minute. This happened around 10.

Then, after skirting the plane, it took off at a low altitude toward the West. 
On it, the general direction they took off in was "West". A full wing co-workers came out of the train and he saw it leaving as a bright star.

Mr. [REDACTED] was shaken by the experience, and his only reaction was "if something like this has to happen, let it be on some one else's shift."

Well, that is the story as I got it. If it is of interest enough to other witnesses, we haven't looked for any or said any thing about it, as most would laugh at some thing like this as unbelievable or plain hoax anyway, but the man watched this for about an hour, and there may be others who saw this; I thought it would be worth while writing about it.

On the other hand, if this is the result of any government experimental work or project, forget about this latter, and as far as I am concerned the story ends right here; if not, I hope you will investigate the incident.

Thank you for listening.
Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
Nantucket, Pt. Lt. N.Y.
