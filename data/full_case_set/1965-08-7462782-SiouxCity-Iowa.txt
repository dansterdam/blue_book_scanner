Extract from General Post Office report of 4 August 60/62348 Omaha phone 434, Recorded according to 3 objects flying 3 to 8 miles south west of Sioux City, Iowa. At times the objects would disappear then reappear. The objects seemed to give off a pulsating light at intervals. The objects changed direction and speed several times during the observation period.

Another sighting according to radio communication. To that the sighting was observed by persons at I____ Lake. The objects appeared larger and seemed to maneuver at high speed. The objects appeared to hover and then accelerate and dart away at a very high rate of speed. Two of the objects appeared to cross the sky from West to East in an estimated 12 to 15 seconds. This was an extremely high rate of speed.

From flight service center: There was an exercise being conducted in that area with jet aircraft but there were no unknown aircraft operating in the area at the time. All reported aircraft were under positive control and accounted for.
