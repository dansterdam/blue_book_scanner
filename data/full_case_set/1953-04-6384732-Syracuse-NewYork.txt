Here is the text from the document:

McMillin Observatory
22 June 1953

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson:

Certainly of considerable interest. A few cases are of considerable interest. Over 20 January, Stuttgart, Germany, Fireballs most probably account for 1 cases; balloons for four and aircraft probably three.

Coming to the interesting cases: the Korean 20 April should certainly be followed up. This cases seems surely close to secure a security-intelligence matter. I'd certainly like to get more information on this. How about sending a few Form A's to be ready? Actually, this should have been investigated to the spot by Intelligence officers.

Pepperrell AFB 2 May: This has come similarities to the old German cases. Much fuller report needed and Form A filled out on this.

San Antonio 7 May: This has much similarities to the Lubbock Lights and Form A should certainly be sent if this has not already been done.

Finally, a Form A for the 29 April Syracuse stationary-disc sighting would help. The green light sightings, jets should have 38 of them south-southeast for over 8 minutes. Order for observers to see green blinking lights at time interval also seems too fast. I hope that you can eventually send me more information on these 20 April Notes: 2 May Pepperell; 7 May San Antonio.

I am enclosing my version of a report on our recent trip with which I hope you will concur. And keep I am coming. It's easier to handle a few at a time and frequently than a larger batch at longer intervals.

Jennie send her regards.
