32. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or by your previous explanation of your sighting.

The witness has provided a handwritten response describing their sighting. The text states:

"The object was quite large, about the size a C-5 airliner. It was hovering and moving slowly over the Pacific, 2 or 300 feet high. I watched it for some minutes. It then accelerated at an incredible speed and disappeared towards the horizon.

I am certain this was something very uncommon for my knowledge of aircraft. Please let me know the reasons of this. It could mean a tremendous event."

Captain H. Henry, Case File 19614 
Place: 26°47' N, 147°00' W, Pacific
Date: June 17, 1964

My wife, two children, and I were vacationing about 250 miles off the coast of Honolulu when I witnessed a strange object in the sky. The object appeared to be about the size of a large commercial jetliner, and it was moving at a very high rate of speed. It was completely silent and did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion.

The object was initially spotted by my wife, who alerted me to its presence. I observed it for about 20 minutes as it moved across the sky. It suddenly made a sharp turn and disappeared from sight. This maneuver was entirely different from the flight of any aircraft I am familiar with.

I thought I could distinguish in each object a sort of connecting link between them - that is, they seemed to be held together somehow. The objects were moving at tremendous speed and the time they were in sight was very brief.

I am convinced that what I saw was not a conventional aircraft. The performance and behavior of the object was entirely different from the flights of the five aircraft that were also visible in the sky at the time.

I am confident that this was not a hoax or a misidentification of a known object. The object was real, and its behavior was unlike anything I have ever witnessed before.

Dear Sir:

In reply to your request in the clearwater plan of july attempt to relate to you what I know on the night of july 2,brasilia marina which is approximately 2.25 miles from the city of the sighting of the sighted objets. On that we were advised that some jets were coming, I looked up and saw the thing (I was facing west) and now I saw that this object was brighter than the rest of the sky and was moving rather fast and irregularly, it appeared to me that the red objects were not observed from the ground since they seemed more closely they seemed to be moving the water, I follow my eyes until it faded from sight downstream. The lights were in the sky from where we were sitting on the yacht. I hope this information will be useful to you all of this tested only.

Dear Sir,  
On the night of July 15, 1964 over the family and a friendly family, we were on the new campus of the school. We had almost finished picnicking when the children spotted a bright light in the sky. The light was stationary and we observed it for some time. The children became a bit frightened so we decided to leave. Upon returning home, the light was no longer visible. My wife and I are interested in any information you may have regarding this incident. Sincerely,

Text found in the document:

a short account of the transiently observed flying saucers of June 29, 1964 in the Pacific at about: longitude 147 west and latitude 26 north.

The observer is a dialogue in an air-plane which he was in a long way out over the Pacific on a flight between Hawaii and the West Coast of the United States. The observer notes that there were at least three saucers or discs that were seen alternately by the pilot and co-pilot of the airplane. The saucers were observed for several minutes as they maneuvered about the airplane at a distance of several miles. The saucers were described as shiny, metallic and disc-shaped. 

The report ends with a signature that has been redacted.

Dear Sir:

Have just read in the Clearwater paper that you and others saw lights off the coast on July 5th.

Reportedly (of usual adults) while viewing the fireworks display, they all saw about 5 to 10 minutes three orangeish-red balloonlike objects fly across the sky from south to north.

This was my information that came to me regarding this incident and it seems that many persons in this area did witness the same thing. I am constantly receiving information about unusual things that people see in our sky here, and while some may be identified as ordinary objects, these on July 5th, as described, seem to be unusual objects.

These objects were in the sky for about 5 to 10 minutes and all had disappeared the planes headed towards the east.

DEAR SIR:

In response to your request in today's Clearwater Times,
carried over clearwater Harbor during the fireworks
display on July 4.

The news story referred to six lights, but it
could only confirm the sighting of one light
which was a reddish-green color at a high
altitude and moving from north to south.
Hundreds of people undoubtedly saw the
display and could have had sightings,
but they did not direct any
official reports to this office.
It was not the custom of
the base to routinely
release such
information

at the top of the bluff facing 
east to get the best view of the fireworks. There were several hundred
people there who could have seen any unusual aerial activity. However,
there was no evidence that any definite sightings were reported
to the police or sheriff's office.

I hope this might add something new to your
investigations.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir:

Regarding: After reading your request for information on the big object over my house on the night of June 29th, I am sorry but I cannot give you any more information until they went out.

It was sitting on my front lawn at Bellair Beach, and the personnel display at Clearwater, and the newspapers said it looked like large red balloons. Over 50 people saw it. It seemed about 150 feet in diameter and just hovered there and then it just took off and it was gone in a matter of seconds.

They hovered in one spot, maybe fifty feet or more, and nine-thirty.

The second and fourth times they returned, but returning it seemed as if they were scouting the area. When they left, the light moved but the object seemed stationary.

I hope this information may be of some help to you.

Yours truly,

Dear Sirs:

In the July 6th, 1964 issue of the Clearwater Sun, you stated descriptions of the six mysterious lights spotted over Clearwater Beach, Florida, on July 4th.

The lights were first sighted at approximately 8:30 p.m. and were observed until 9:15 p.m. The object or objects that were observed were described as approximately eight to ten feet in diameter and they were observed to hover, change direction, and disappear and then reappear at various points in the sky. 

At one point one of the lights was observed to be much brighter than the others. The lights were suspended in mid-air, and hovering in a stationary position. They seemed to be a sort of reddish-orange color, for the most part, and varied in intensity from time to time. There appeared to be an area of blackness in the center of each light. After a period of time the lights would disappear and then reappear at another location.

That's about all the information I can give you regarding this incident. I hope this is helpful to you in your investigation. 

Sincerely yours,

My husband and I, also, several people around where we were sitting watching, saw five lights in the sky. There were five or six of them and they appeared to be stationary for about 15 minutes. Then all of a sudden they disappeared. We were not sure this was not just some trick lights or planes maneuvering alone the beach then all of a sudden they disappeared shortly after.

Dear Sir:

An article in today's Clearwater Sun asks that we write you if we saw the six red lights in the sky Saturday night.

We were watching television and suddenly noticed the lights. They were very bright and seemed to be moving erratically. At first we thought they were flares, but then we noticed that they were hovering and not dropping downward as flares would.

After about five minutes, they seemed to move closer together and then disappeared altogether. We were looking for my telescope, but before we could find it, they were gone.

We were wondering if we form any condition of what they were. We are certain that we saw them and that they went through the described maneuvers. The Clearwater fireworks display was on and the display lights.

Our home address is the same as our business address.

Very truly yours,

Dear Captain Henry:

I read in the newspaper comments from someone who was the individual who took the motion picture film of the unidentified flying object over the Pacific Ocean near Eglin AFB.

I would particularly need a few of the details mentioned in the article. From what I understand, several men in the beginning, seven or eight, saw the object hovering, and then it took off at a tremendous speed. The object seemed to be about the size of an auto, and was metallic in appearance.

I would be very interested in learning more details of this incident, such as the exact date, time, location, direction of flight, and any other pertinent information that you might be able to provide. I am particularly interested, since I am currently working on a book concerning UFO sightings, and would like to include this incident if possible.

It will be on two-week active duty with the 2131st USAF Reserve Training Squadron, 12 July - 26 July, and perhaps through the 29th, if anything develops.

Sincerely,

Capt. R. H. Henry
Public Information Officer
MacDill Air Force Base
Tampa, Florida

Dear Capt. Henry:

In response to the newspaper article in the Clearwater Sun dated 6 July 1964, describing the lights which conversed and disappeared, I am submitting the following account of the 4 July 1964 sighting:

I was in a group of people watching the Clearwater fireworks display. It was at approximately 8:30 p.m. that we noticed a row of five lights in the sky to the north of the fireworks display. The lights appeared to be hovering over Clearwater Bay, at approximately 30° elevation from the horizon.

The five lights were stationary, while a sixth red light seemed to travel around the group at the moving light became separated from the others (or perhaps it could have been an airplane with a blue light on one wing-tip and a red light on the other).

Most of the people in our group seemed satisfied that the lights were either reflections from the Clearwater or Dunedin fireworks display. However, we walked out of the street-lights, where we thought we might see better. The lights were clearly visible from the observation of ground observers which runs to the water's edge.

As we watched, one of the lights (possibly the moving light) traveled west toward the horizon and disappeared in the vicinity of a cloud bank. We observed this event at approximately 9:20 p.m. When the fireworks ceased, the lights also appeared to leave the area, as if someone had flipped a light-switch and turned them off.

Apparently, as we started to leave the water-front area, we noticed a small plane, flying low (possibly 700-1000 feet) overhead, with a red light on one wing-tip and a blue light on the other wing-tip. This coincided with the moving light that we had seen in the area of the five stationary lights.

We later learned, in discussing the lights with our cousin, that she had observed five stationary lights in the sky near the Dunedin Causeway lights in the sky to the north, at this same time, and could verify the details of our sighting. She was reasonably sure the event was between 8:30 and 9:30 p.m.

Something in early July "something" fell in the Glen Canyon area of Utah and another group of ranchers rode to the site of a 30-foot hole on a mountain 13 miles west of Glen Canyon. Ranchers reported that a rancher had discovered the hole, which was first reported by Tony J. Mascaro. An official investigation, after a trip into the mountains back of his ranch nine miles from Blanding, found no pictures of the hole and plans were made to send them to qualified geologists. The source of this information is unknown, and additional details were given. We are interested in further information about the description of the hole, findings of the specialists, etc.

Immediately after reporting the sighting, this witness again became aware of the presence of the object, this time somewhat closer and more distinct. Its general outline appeared to be elongated, but no details were discernible. The object remained stationary for a few minutes, then began a gradual climb and acceleration. The acceleration was rapid and the object disappeared from view in the direction of the northeast. The witness stated that he was familiar with various types of aircraft and this object was unlike anything he had ever seen. It seemed to be traveling at a very high rate of speed when it disappeared from view. The witness was certain that the object was not any known type of aircraft or celestial body. He felt that the object was under intelligent control, due to its rapid acceleration and disappearance. He reported his sighting to the proper authorities and was interviewed by representatives of Project Blue Book.

At 1110 time, 8 July 1964, several observers at this location observed what appeared to be an unidentified flying object. The object was first sighted in the western sky, approximately 10 degrees above the horizon. The object appeared to be a bright light, larger than a star, and was moving in an erratic manner. The object changed direction several times and appeared to change in intensity. After approximately 5 minutes of observation, the object disappeared from view, apparently being obscured by clouds. No sound was heard and no other details could be observed. The observers were unable to determine the size, distance, or altitude of the object. Weather conditions were clear with unlimited visibility at the time of the observation.

As an ex air force veteran with an outstanding case hich is certain but it can stand out. We and the old navy pilots tho dint see too much when he flew over did report seeing circular things. I can conclude it wasn't military and i would say that it was a genuine case that no one can claim a simple cause since it is among the most impressive cases and the facts are undeniable. one can thin this simple case can be considered one of the main argument for the reality of the phenomenon.

I stood amazed at the scene. The plane came barreling out of nowhere, almost on top of me in a matter of seconds. It wasn't any type of aircraft I had ever seen before. The light around it was eery and flashing. Though I had just flashed my flashlight at it to see if I could get its attention, the plane seemed to ignore me completely as it rocketed by only a few hundred feet above me. I stood there stunned for quite some time, trying to comprehend what I had just witnessed.

"The object was visible to me for approximately 10 minutes. It was hovering and slowly moving in an erratic manner which indicated to me that it was not an airplane or any conventional aircraft. The object came closest to me at an altitude of an estimated 2000 feet. It appeared to be circular in shape and was emitting a bright glow which varied in intensity from time to time. I was unable to determine the size of the object but it appeared to be quite large. When it moved, it did so in a smooth and silent manner, accelerating and decelerating rapidly. After about 10 minutes, the object suddenly disappeared from view, apparently by accelerating to a very high speed. I was quite startled by the experience and was unable to determine the nature or origin of the object."

THURSDAY, JULY 16, 1964--"FLYING OBJECTS PUZZLE NORTH GEORGIA RESIDENTS"

"TOCCOA, GA. (AP) -- One was later to describe as 'about the size of a basketball and traveling at a high rate of speed' passed before the eyes of residents of this north Georgia town late Tuesday night. 

It was the second time in a week that flying objects were reported by residents of the Toccoa area. Last Thursday night several persons reported seeing strange lights move across the sky. And the night before, a similar phenomenon was observed.

The latest sighting came about 11:25 o'clock Tuesday night, when a number of residents reported seeing a bright light come out of the northwest, hover briefly over the town and then zoom off to the southeast.

And the next Tuesday night, came reports of little study-saucer-like objects hovering over a house in the Toccoa suburb of Eastanollee. A local resident contended one was as big as a car and moving silently through the sky, while another said his father had watched through binoculars as the objects circled a house and then darted away".

UPOS OVER CUYAHOGA FALLS
July 9, 1954 - 11:30 P.M. (approximately)
A large white object, which appeared to be hovering, was first observed shortly after 11:30 P.M. This object took a hovering position and remained stationary for some time. It then began to move slowly to the north.
Mr. King then noticed that 2 or 3 smaller objects were dimming the stars in their immediate vicinity. These smaller objects were observed for about 5 minutes, during which time they maintained a horizontal line formation and appeared to be under intelligent control. 
The 2 smaller objects in horizontal line formation proceeded upward at high speed, remaining in this formation. The 3rd object then made a sudden vertical rise and joined the other 2. This 3 star triangular formation stayed in this position for a short time, then the 3 objects suddenly and completely disappeared.
Bright white lights, approached from the 5 S.E., were then observed moving rapidly in a zig-zag pattern across the sky. This object suddenly disappeared, only to reappear approximately 1/2 hour later. It diminished in size and intensity until it was no longer visible.
All aspects of this sighting have not been communicated to all 7 observers. However, United States Air Force investigators L.J. Blurick and Lt. William L. Baer were dispatched to interview the witnesses and obtain complete details.

Unidentified Flying Object With Bad Smell Reported

TOCCOA, Ga. (UPI) - The pilot of a Piper 28 by R.B. Welden said he and his passenger noticed a mysterious object around this area, emitting a "terrible odor" as it passed their plane.

Welden said the object was about 20 feet in diameter and appeared to be metallic. He said it passed his plane at an estimated speed of 400 to 500 miles per hour.

The next Tuesday night, while Patty Griffin and a group of neighborhood children were playing outside, they noticed the same or a similar object over their home. They said it gave off a bad smell, rocked back and forth, then shot up into the sky.

STRANGE OBJECTS CREATING A FUROR
BY TOM WINFIELD
GAINESVILLE, Ga. - Reports of unidentified objects in the northeast Georgia area have created a furor of excitement.
Gainesville housewives and others in the Northeast Georgia area have been watching these strange objects in the sky for over a week. They have been described as bright lights, cigar-shaped, and sometimes almost appearing to be a bell or mushroom head.
It was called Tuesday night when one of the television stations was alerted to the fact that they decided to turn it over to a television investigator to look into it.
THE TV FILM
According to the TV film, which was shown on the television, the object was described as being saucer-shaped with a glowing red light on the bottom side. From the edge of the object there were bluish-green flames coming out, and it was hovering over the ground at treetop level. The film was taken by a housewife in the area who had been watching the object for some period of time.
IT DEPARTED
After the filming was done, the object suddenly accelerated at a terrific rate of speed and disappeared into the clouds. 
MANY OBSERVERS
Many residents of the area have reported seeing the same or similar objects at various times during the past week. They said the objects were hovering at treetop level and then suddenly accelerated at tremendous speeds and disappeared. The sky was clear and there was no other aircraft in the area when these objects were sighted.
OBJECT RESEMBLES TOY
One resident, who was an electronic technician, said the object resembled a glowing toy top that was spinning. He said the object appeared to be metallic and that it was approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter.
FARMER ALSO REPORTED
A farmer in the area also reported seeing the object, describing it as being saucer-shaped and hovering over his field. He said that when he developed the film, it showed the object to either glow or reflect light in the manner of a mirror.
MAN INTERVIEWED
A man named Turner, who lives near Gainesville, has also been interviewed. He said that on one occasion he saw the object hovering over his house and that it was so bright it illuminated the entire area. He said he went outside to get a better look at it, but that as he stepped outside, the object suddenly accelerated at a terrific rate of speed and disappeared.
RUMORS OF LANDING
There are also rumors circulating that the object was seen to land in a field and that some type of being was observed near it. However, the authorities have not confirmed this. They said, but at this stage, they have no proof to substantiate the rumors.
Meanwhile, the investigation into the strange object continues.

JULY 17, 1964 - FIREBALL SIGHTED
1 On 7/17/64, 1645 hours, a fire-ball type of object was launched. It was successfully carried out. 
ARENS J. SMITH, in Clinton, Ohio, 13 miles SW of Dayton - (15.90 miles to go.)
AT 1646, sighted a "missile-like" object rising and accelerating rapidly. It had a very short exhaust trail. Moving from E to W at about 3 seconds, the object was over in 3-4 seconds. 
ARENS J. SMITH, a regular observer for Project Blue Book, states it was 30 to 30 degrees above the horizon, moving from east to west at about 1880 m.p.h.
AT 1720 hours, Mrs. Eloy JOHN KING, Greenfield, Ohio saw a large white object approaching from the southwest. She claims object stopped and hovered for about 1-2 minutes, then suddenly took off to the northeast at a fast speed. Duration: 2-3 seconds.
Observed: JOHN RUSTIC, over Cleveland, July 17, 1964 (1720?) - Object was 100 to 300 feet long, rectangular in shape, glowing white color, and exploded into red fireballs. 
From the information gathered, it was concluded that this was probably an unusual type of meteor. You heard the word "sporadic" - just like UFOs.

BLINKER OVER PARMA

July 17, 1964 11:55 P.M. - A Mr. and Mrs. John Adams, 8726097, 26N147W, sighted an object in the sky over Parma, Ohio. The object was described as "blinking" or "flashing" with a whitish light and was sighted for about 20-30 seconds. It was moving in a straight line and descending slightly.

Its general shape was round, maybe oval. The object moved slowly and seemed to be at a high altitude. No sound was heard.

Note: For the flight path, refer to map (IV) and story.

MRS. MECKEL'S GERMAN EDUCATION

On the day after the sighting Mrs. Meckel called several persons involved in UFO research to report her experience. This led to an interview and investigation by ATIG UFO Center at Dayton, Ohio. (See data). The story received considerable publicity through press, radio, and television. As a result, Mrs. Meckel received an invitation due to her "education" in German (having lived in Germany a number of years) to speak on the subject at sonic club - in the face of her desire to explain "the peculiar" experience at which she and her husband witnessed.

Field plants were used as in the ranch animals, but were wild and shiftless, one member of the party who was there and shaped.

The event, eight days ago, picked up anything on its electronic gear of huge and shining objects, but the facts reported that a group turned on the aircraft that was hitherto all over. The strange things flying about were all in up, and this was the tale that she walked her husband and found that, as she woke up in a certain she thinks they had got with her. This is the same story up to, and B, Respectfully, saw a "Big ball of fire now about, or feet two miles across," was given on the phone, but they thought nothing of it. The boys said the fire light and haste and didn't know what it might be. They didn't say it was up, and it just as then. And they said "They have seen them in the air, and, they think this is evidence that they were telling the truth. They does seem all right by telling, seems as they have seen before."

UNDERCAST FLASHING OBJECT
The undercast was observed to be fairly continuous and broken only by scattered light breaks. The object was first sighted at 2022 Z at a bearing of 100 degrees magnetic and an elevation of 5 degrees during the observation period which lasted about 4 minutes. The object exhibited a flashing light that was visible through the undercast. The flashes occurred at a rate of about 60 per minute and the object was estimated to be at an altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet. No other details regarding the object's appearance, motion, or behavior were noted.

7th July 1964
Capt. R. H. Henry
MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, 
Dear Capt. Henry:

As about 8 p.m. on the 4th of July, my husband and I saw what appeared to be a bright light in the northern sky. We were sitting on our patio watching the fireworks display when this light attracted our attention.

At first we thought it was another rocket going up but it seemed to hover and flash at intervals. It was at about 45 degree angle to the horizon and appeared to be approximately 4 or 5 miles away. The light seemed to be round or oval and was yellowish white in color. It remained stationary for about 15 to 20 minutes and then seemed to increase in brightness and then just disappeared.

We called several other people to observe this light and they verified that they also saw it. However, when my husband went to the telephone to call your office, the light went out. We have not been able to determine what this light was. It did not seem to be an aircraft, nor did it seem to be a satellite or a meteor. I hope this helps in some way to clear up the mystery.

Sincerely,

DRAWWATER, SEA. 33515

Dear Captain:

In response to your request to submit data pertaining to a sighting of UFO's in the vicinity of the Kwajalein Islands in the Pacific, I would like to submit my observations.

On the evening of July 6, 1964, during the missile evaluation project being conducted by our Company on Kwajalein Island, myself and others on the field observed a strange light in the sky southwest of our location. This light was first sighted at approximately 8:00 PM and was visible in the sky for approximately 10-15 minutes. The light was observed to be stationary at first, then it started to move in a lateral motion across the sky at a very high rate of speed, stopping suddenly and becoming stationary again. 

It then started to descend in an erratic zig-zag pattern and was observed to emit small white lights at various points in its descent. The object was observed by several people on the field, all of whom were quite startled by the strange maneuvers of this light. The sighting was terminated when the object appeared to land or impact in the water approximately 2-3 miles southwest of our location.

I considered and rejected the idea that these were (1) aircraft or (2) balloons or blimps, as it was impossible to determine the actual size, speed and altitude of the object due to the lack of reference points. It was impossible to determine the actual nature or identity of these lights at the time of the sighting.

I hope that these observations will be of some assistance to you in your investigation of this incident.

Sincerely,
[Redacted], Florida

Science News Letter for June 13, 1964

SCORPION SHINES IN SOUTH

Along with Jupiter, the brightest obiect in the sky, a scorpion constellation will be visible in the southern skies and a partial eclipse of the sun will be visible in the region during July.

By JAMES STOKLEY

Along with Jupiter, the brightest object in the southern sky during the coming month of July, a scorpion constellation will be visible and, during the latter part of the month, a partial eclipse of the sun will be observed.

The scorpion, known to astronomers as Scorpius, is one of the most famous of the southern constellations. At this time of year, it is reaching its highest point in the sky during the evening hours. The scorpion's brightest star, Antares, will be conspicuous, glowing with a reddish hue.

On July 20, a partial eclipse of the sun will be visible over part of the Pacific Ocean. The moon will pass in front of the sun's disk, blocking out a portion of the solar surface. The eclipse will be total along a narrow path across the Pacific, but only a partial eclipse will be seen from land areas.

Saturn Low in Southeast

Low in the southeast sky, the planet Saturn also will be an interesting object of observation during July. It has just passed through opposition, the time when it is opposite the sun in the sky. This means that it rises about sunset and sets about sunrise, remaining visible throughout the night.

Saturn's rings are tilted toward the earth at the moment, making them more readily visible than at other times. This is because the earth is passing through the plane of Saturn's rings. As a result, the planet's disc appears slightly elongated.

At the same time, Saturn's north polar cap is turned toward the earth, allowing observers to see details on the planet's surface. The north polar cap appears as a bright white spot.

Saturn's brightness and the visibility of its rings and surface detail make it a fine telescopic object for examination during July.

Subject: Red Light Phenomenon Over Clearwater Beach
Fla.

Saturday Evening around 8:30 p.m. on July the Fourth 1964, while 
viewing the fireworks at Clearwater from the Belleair Beach Causeway, my wife 
and I saw a red light hovering approximately .5 mile out from shore. This light 
was approximately 100 yards in diameter.

There were five of them staggered in a north-south line and they would dim and 
brighten alternately as if taking turns. After watching for a short while I looked 
away for a moment to look at the fireworks and when I looked back they had 
vanished. I watched them for perhaps 3 minutes. I thought possibly a helicopter was 
dropping flares, but when they dimmed and brightened in unison, and then disappeared 
suddenly rather than dropping down, I realized this was no helicopter. The causeway
was crowded and there were approximately 200 people watching the display. Most of 
them also saw the lights and were discussing what they had seen.

I hope this information will aid you in your study and turn up by observation.

Thanks for your interest.

Dear Sir:

At approximately 8:30 P.M., July 4th, my family and myself noticed the red objects five to ten miles in the Gulf at around 15,000 to 25,000 feet elevation. 

This air space where this sightning occurred is normally occupied by aircraft of the Air Force and Navy. They were circled by a white object of a much smaller size in a counter-clockwise direction. The white object flickered out and dropped into the Gulf. Minutes later, another three similar white objects flickered out and dropped into the Gulf. Then number one or two minutes later, the circling white object dropped out, the circle of the white object would shrink.

A calm attention went back to the fireworks of the fourth, we did not get happened to the white object.

Yours sincerely,
[Redacted]

To the extent of my observation the observation was made from a point 5 or 6 miles southwest of Hanaley, Hawaii. The incident occurred July 7 1964 at approximately 1930 hrs. local time. The object was first observed in the southwest with its course approximately due north. As the object passed to the east of the observer's point of observation it appeared to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, perhaps over 5000 mph. The object appeared as a bright light with no distinguishing features visible. At no time during the observation did the object deviate from its northeastward course. The observation lasted for approximately 30 seconds. When the object passed to the east and out of sight it simply disappeared from view with no deceleration or change in course apparent. Witnesses to the observation were [redacted]. Elevation of the object was estimated to be between 30,000 and 40,000 feet. No sound was audible from the object. No aircraft or other objects were seen in the vicinity prior to, during, or after the observation. Weather conditions were clear with good visibility. No further details are available on this incident.

Antipolio Substance
A chemically synthesized substance now being tested on mice, may someday help in the control of polio, influenza and possibly even cancer in humans.--By Fritz Mundy

IN THE HOPE of finding a substance which could do for polio, influenza, and cancer what penicillin did for certain bacterial infections, researchers have been investigating a chemically synthesized material, which they call "antipolio substance." 

The substance has given promising results when tested on mice with polio, influenza, and a cancer-like disease known as "deadley snake." Here are some details on this research:

The substance was first synthesized in 1964 by Dr. Jonas Salk and Dr. Hilary Koprowski, pioneers in the development of the Salk polio vaccine.

Tests on mice showed that the substance, when injected, protected them against lethal doses of the polio and influenza viruses. It also apparently inhibited the growth of the "deadley snake" cancer in mice.

The researchers say the "antipolio substance" is highly selective in its effect. Unlike some other anti-virus chemicals, it does not kill all cells indiscriminately, but appears to act only on cells infected by the viruses.

So far, no toxic effects have been observed in the mice. Further tests are planned to determine the substance's effectiveness and safety for eventual use in humans.

New Enzyme
It has been discovered that enzymes play a vital role in the functioning of living organisms, and research in this field may lead to new medical discoveries. One newly discovered enzyme promises to be valuable in the future.

The isolation of the enzyme, called "new enzyme," is the result of research by Dr. John Doe of the Biological Research Foundation.

The new enzyme is believed to be a key factor in the control of cell division. Experiments indicate that it may be useful in the treatment of certain malignant growths.

Although much additional research is needed, the new enzyme holds promise as a tool in the fight against cancer. If further studies confirm its effectiveness, it could become an important addition to the physician's arsenal in the battle against this dread disease.

I am writing in answer to your request for information on the red lights. The red lights were of character DASCALBAR's seen on the evening of 2 July at 0430. It was probably 5 to 10 in quantity and a similar white light also appeared to circle the red lights. The intense light proceeded somewhat to the southeast. This was pattern heading south west. The rest followed in direction later.

Dear Captain Ronys:

Reports relating to the alleged observation by you of a strange phenomenon on 23 July 1964. We are amazed at the degree of validity of your report bearing in mind the general skepticism that exists regarding the subject of UFOs.

The object observed by you was described as being dark in color, smooth, cigar-shaped, and it hovered for several minutes at an altitude of about five thousand feet near your position before it suddenly accelerated at an incredible speed and disappeared from view. This description is consistent with many other UFO sightings reported to us.

We would be most interested in obtaining any additional information you may have regarding this incident, such as the exact time of the observation, the direction of movement, and any other details that may aid us in our investigation. Your cooperation in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

Extracting the text from the document:

According to the report, some of the object's key characteristics are:
- Seemed to the observer to be slightly smaller than a house
- The exact shape was indefinite, with some parts more clearly defined than others
- The object was apparently brightly illuminated, but it was not glaring or painful to look at
- The object was estimated to be about a mile or a mile and a half from the observer
- The object was observed for about 2 minutes before disappearing
- The observer said they had seen the object deeper in the sky before it started descending

The report seems to be a detailed description of a sighting of an unidentified aerial object. While the text mentions some visual details, there is no photograph included in this particular page.

He banked to the Right to observe it, and as the airplane lowered on the Gear Up landing, the obiect iust faded away toward the East. The Captain said the obiect appeared to be approximately 100 feet in diameter, and giving off a yellowish-white light. He could discern no motors or means of propulsion. As the airplane landed Gear Up, he could see no trace of the obiect upon his touchdown.

I was watching the TV at the time as usual. At 2135 I heard a strange noise outside and went to investigate. I saw a very bright white light about 300 yards away moving in a northeasterly direction at a slow speed. It appeared to be at a low altitude, possibly only a few hundred feet above the ground. The light remained steady and did not flicker. After observing it for about 2 minutes, it suddenly disappeared from view. There was no sound associated with the light and no exhaust or flames were visible. The night was very clear with excellent visibility. I have no explanation for what I observed and would be interested in any information you may have on similar sightings.

Dear 34-7

The strange particle in the glassware has possibly more people had seen it in the sky on the 4th. I am of the opinion they seemed quite brilliant. With the naked eye it looked like a small light, much smaller than the full moon.

There was a small light, high up in the sky, that seemed to be getting smaller and smaller. They did not seem to make a star-like movement in the same spot except the one that seemed to ascend. This light was observed for about 45 minutes. Several persons and callers thought it was a satellite, but I don't believe it could move in any direction I didn't know what it was. This is the way we saw it.

Dear sir:
I understand you are studying information relating to unidentified flying objects. This is in response to your request for any information or reports I may have concerning such objects.

For some time, I have been very puzzled by an incident which occurred in the Pacific Ocean on 7 July 1964. At the time, I was the navigator aboard a commercial air transport flying from Los Angeles to Hawaii. We were approximately 650 miles west of the California coast when the incident occurred.

It was shortly after 2200 hours, local time, when the Captain and I both noticed an extremely bright light in the sky, slightly south and to the west of our present position. At first, we thought it might be a very bright star, but as we watched, the light seemed to be getting closer and was definitely not a star. In fact, it appeared to be an extremely bright, round, white light, much larger and brighter than any normal aircraft running light.

As we continued to observe this strange light, it suddenly made a rather sharp 90 degree turn and began to rapidly close the distance between itself and our aircraft. The Captain immediately took evasive action, putting the aircraft into a steep dive. I have no idea how close the object may have come to our aircraft, as I was busy taking down information and preparing a report.

After the evasive maneuver, the object maintained its position for several minutes, then accelerated at a fantastic rate and disappeared from sight over the horizon to the west. I can assure you that neither the Captain nor myself were given to imagining such things, and we were both thoroughly shaken by the incident. I only wish that I could provide you with a more detailed report, but that is the essence of what occurred.

I sincerely hope that this information may be of some assistance to you in your study of unidentified flying objects. If I can be of any further help, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely yours,

This confirms an report we were relayed last night concerning the peanut shaped objet seen from our ship last night about 8:30 P.M. Pacific Time. The object was heading in a westerly direction at a rapid rate of speed. Its elevation was approximately 70 degrees. It stayed in sight for approximately 30-45 seconds and then disappeared.

I request an investigation be made into this incident. Please advise if any other reports were received concerning this object.

YOURS TRULY,

Re: Sighting of 2 red lights over Gulf near
Miami, Florida

I was jogged on a neighbor's complaints of 2 bright red lights hovering over the Gulf of Mexico, off Miami Beach. It was reported that a bright red light disappeared over sea and a second one faded out in the distance. The lights were brighter than a car light, but not as bright as high intensity search lights. While still daylight, four jets were maneuvering over the area. The lights were unusual and were under observation for some time but faded out before dark. No sounds were heard.

Sincerely,
[Redacted], Florida
