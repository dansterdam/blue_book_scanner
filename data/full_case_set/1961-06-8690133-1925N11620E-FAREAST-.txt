From: Commander U. S. Naval Defense Forces Eastern Pacific
To: Commander, U. S. Naval Forces, Washington, D.C.

Subj: Unidentified flying object

1. The object was sighted by the Master of SS KOREAN BEAR of the Pacific Far East Line and is forwarded for information.

The object was observed while the ship was enroute on a voyage from Japan to San Francisco, a bright object at latitude 39.25* N, longitude 139.25* E, bearing 22' degrees.

The object appeared to be hovering, was elongated in shape, emitting a brilliant light, and traveling at a speed estimated at approximately 1300 knots.

The object was being observed with binoculars and was continuing on a course bearing 140 degrees, altitude 20 degrees. After about 2 minutes it disappeared in a heavy cloud formation.

2. The above sighting was confirmed by two other officers and appeared similar to other satellite and missile tests observed in the past but did not correspond to any known aircraft.

3. Comment: Master (...) is a sincere, intelligent individual who has furnished reliable information in the past.
