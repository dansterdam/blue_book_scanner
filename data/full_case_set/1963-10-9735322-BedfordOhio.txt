[Handwritten response:]
The object was large, and very bright, and seemed to just hover in the sky. It was very still and silent. There appeared to be no visible source of propulsion or structure. It just seemed to be a large bright light that hung in the sky for some time. I have seen many strange things in the sky, but this was one of the brightest and most unusual.
