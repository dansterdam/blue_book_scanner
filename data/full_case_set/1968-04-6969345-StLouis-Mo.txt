Dear [redacted],

Your letter dated April 10, 1968, addressed to U.S. Air Force Special Investigations, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, concerning a possible sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) has been forwarded to this office for reply.

Without additional information, you cannot offer an explanation of the object you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it to this office, we will enclose an envelope, with technical instructions, that will be able to investigate this matter further.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may help you identify the sighting. Thank you for reporting it to the Air Force.

The image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The larger sketch on the left appears to be a compass rose, with the cardinal and intercardinal directions labeled. The smaller sketch on the right appears to be a landscape scene depicting a person standing on a road or path with hills or mountains in the background.

8A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "T" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "T" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE TWO POINTS WITH A LINE TO SHOW DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT. IF THE PHENOMENON APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

The object was cigar shaped rather than round and appeared to be some type of aircraft. It was dark in color but there did not appear to be any lights on it. It was moving slowly and silently, sometimes hovering and sometimes moving forward. At one point it tilted so that the bottom could be seen and it appeared to be completely dark. The motion was unusual and erratic. It seemed to be under some kind of intelligent control. It was observed for several minutes and was not thought to be an ordinary aircraft.
