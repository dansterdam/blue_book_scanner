The text written in the description field describes an observation of an unidentified aerial object that the observer found to be moving and making sharp course changes. The observer reports that the object was bright, roughly circular, and several times the size of a star. The observer also mentions that the object disappeared from view after a few minutes of observation.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

The text in the document reads as follows:

The object changed color from yellow-white to a brilliant red, and then changed to a brilliant blue. It seemed to come over the observer to a distance of about 900 yards. It made a very gradual climb and seemed to go up in sort of steps, accompanied by a whining noise which seemed to increase in intensity as it climbed. As it moved away, it seemed to be tilted off balance and go into a slight wobble. When over the location, the object appeared to be about the size of a medium sized automobile from the observers point of view. The object was observed by the witness for about 90 seconds. The observation took place at approximately 10:20 p.m. on June 4, 1953. The witness, who was driving a car at the time, is considered to be of sound mind and reliable. This information is submitted for your consideration.

In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could suddenly enlarge the object which you saw. Of what type material would you say the object is made and what structures, if any, would you say are present in it? WOULD BE LUCITE & DE LIT IN SUCH A WAY THAT NO LIGHT, BEAM ETC. WOULD PROTRUDE (THE LIGHT OF THE OBJECT WAS DISTINCT WITH NO SOURCE OR DISTORTIONS). IT WOULD BE A SPHERE OF SOME DIAMETEREE. IT WOULD BE OPAQUE OBJECTS THAT MAY APPEAR THE SAME ARE: THE MOON (BUT SMALLER) IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE, A DISTANT LIGHT, A LEMON, AN ORANGE, A RED PLATE.

The image appears to contain two sketches or diagrams. The first sketch shows a curved line indicating the horizon (skyline) and an object labeled "A" placed above the horizon. The second sketch shows a larger scene with a person standing on a road in the foreground and a curved horizon or skyline in the background. The text below the second sketch provides an explanation of how the length of the object would appear in relation to the skyline.

OCR Output:
32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how 
high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to 
show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you fast saw it.

A & B ON A HORIZONTAL COURSE.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its 
position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
