34. Date you completed this questionnaire: _July__5, 1967_____________
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I was driving home from work about 10:00 p.m. on July 5, 1957 traveling north on Route 13 near Morrisville, Pa. I noticed a strange object in the sky. It appeared to be oval shaped and giving off a strange glow. I called to my companion to look at it. She agreed that it was very strange. We rode for a few miles trying to get closer to it. It remained over the same area but seemed to be moving higher. It was giving off a bright light. It looked almost like it was floating. We continued to watch it for 15 to 20 minutes. Finally it just seemed to disappear into the sky. I wish I could give you more details but that is about all I can remember. The whole experience was very strange and something I had never seen before. My companion and I were both amazed at what we saw.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and instructions related to a UFO sighting report. The diagram appears to show the path and angle of an object observed in the sky, as well as instructions for the observer to draw a picture showing the motion and direction of the object(s).

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the sky horizon line where the object was first seen. Show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.
