AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

COUNTRY: United States (Virginia)
REPORT NO.: AIIG-60-001 
DATE: 15 August 1960 
AREA: Vicinity of Eberon, Virginia
DATE-TIME GROUP: 13 August 1960, 1930L
SUBJECT: Unidentified object found near Langley AFB, Virginia
PREPARED BY (NAME): Albert F. Houghton, AC-69878
SOURCE: Various

SUMMARY: (GIVE SIGNIFICANT FACTS, OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS CONSIDERED OF VALUE IN FINAL ANALYSIS. LIMIT INDICATES OF UNCLW, ETC.)

1. On 13 August 1960, at approximately 1930 hours the preparing officer of this report, Major Robert B. Morrow, USAF, received a call from Lt. Col. L.C. Wilson of the 437th Troop Carrier Wing, Langley AFB, that an unidentified object had been recovered in the vicinity of Eberon, Virginia.

2. Lt. Johnson from Naval Intelligence in regard to an unidentified object recovered by the Langley AFB Security Police on 13 August 1960, approximately 1900 hours. Police had called the Duty Officer of Oceana Naval Air Station Saturday night (13 Aug) and reported an unidentified object had been sighted and recovered. The object was then transported from the Langley AFB area to the Security Police Maintenance Area.

3. On 14 August 1960 a party departed Norfolk Naval Air Station Sunday morning (14 Aug) to investigate this object. This party departed Norfolk Naval Air Station the Sunday morning (14 Aug) consisting of Sgt. Stein, A02/C Bennett, and AM2 Semanski. They proceeded by car and jeep to Langley AFB, Va. where they were met by State Police officers. The party was then escorted to the Security Police Maintenance Area at Langley AFB, Va. and traveled another 5 miles to the right on Ft. Eustis. (Lt. Johnston states these directions lead directly to this object). The object was found on the ground with a parachute caught on a tree about 40 feet high. A section of the rubber like material was torn off and carried back to the Security Police Office. Photos were taken of the object and it was examined by the investigating party. Lt. Johnson further stated that detectors were attached to the object and that pictures had been taken of the object. However, the investigating party was unable to obtain the photos or the detectors used on this object.

4. The Air Force was unable to locate this object or confirm its recovery. Negative results attended their investigation.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

THE MYSTERIOUS FLYING OBJECT WHICH RACED OVER MELBOURNE, FLA., JUNE 7, 1960

At approximately 8:00 P. M., June 7, 1960, a mysterious object raced over Melbourne, Florida, and was witnessed by several persons. The object was described as a silvery, saucer-shaped craft approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, traveling at an estimated speed of 600-800 miles per hour. 

The object was first spotted over Melbourne by Mr. and Mrs. William Coker, who were at their home on the outskirts of the city. They watched the object flash across the sky from east to west at a tremendous rate of speed, and it disappeared from sight within a few seconds.

Mr. and Mrs. Coker immediately called the Melbourne police department to report the sighting. Within a few minutes, the object was spotted by several other persons, including employees of the Melbourne police department and a group of teenagers.

The object was described as glowing brightly and seemed to be metallic in appearance. It was visible for only a very short time, but all the witnesses agreed that it was definitely not an ordinary aircraft.

The Air Force was notified of the incident, and an investigation was launched by the Air Force's Project Blue Book. However, no satisfactory explanation for the mysterious object has ever been found.

SIGHTING REPORT

WITNESS: JAMES DERRY
AGE: 37
OCCUPATION: MECHANIC

ON AUGUST 7, 1960, AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30 PM, MR. JAMES DERRY REPORTED 
OBSERVING AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN THE SKIES OVER MELBOURNE, 
FLORIDA. MR. DERRY WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK WHEN HE OBSERVED A 
BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY MOVING ERRATICALLY. THE OBJECT SUDDENLY STOPPED, 
HOVERED FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND THEN SHOT OFF AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. 
MR. DERRY PULLED OVER AND WATCHED THE OBJECT UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM
VIEW. HE THEN PROCEEDED TO HIS HOME AND IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES TO REPORT THE SIGHTING.

INVESTIGATING OFFICERS WERE DISPATCHED TO THE AREA BUT WERE UNABLE TO 
LOCATE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OR TRACE OF THE REPORTED OBJECT. HOWEVER, 
LATER THAT NIGHT, A RESIDENT IN A NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD CONTACTED POLICE 
TO REPORT DISCOVERING WHAT APPEARED TO BE DEBRIS FROM A POSSIBLE CRASH
SITE IN A WOODED AREA NEAR HIS HOME. 

UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, OFFICERS FOUND SCATTERED PIECES OF WHAT 
SEEMED TO BE SOME KIND OF METALLIC MATERIAL IN THE WOODS. PHOTOGRAPHS 
WERE TAKEN AND THE DEBRIS WAS COLLECTED FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS.

THE CASE WAS FORWARDED TO PROJECT BLUE BOOK FOR INVESTIGATION.

ATTN: CIA - Blue Book  

Subject: Unidentified aerial phenomena observed in the Melbourne, Florida area on 8 July 1960.  

1. On the above date, at approximately 11:30 AM, EST, the undersigned was outside his home in Melbourne, Florida, located approximately 4 miles south of the Melbourne Municipal Airport, when he observed a strange aerial object.  

2. The object was first noticed at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 6,000 feet, traveling in a northeasterly direction at a speed estimated to be between 500 and 600 mph. The object appeared to be circular in shape, and was reflecting sunlight to an unusual degree, indicating a highly reflective surface.  

3. The object was under observation for approximately 30 seconds before passing out of sight over the horizon. No sound was heard during the sighting. The weather at the time was clear, with high scattered clouds.

4. Based on the description of the object and its observed characteristics, it is the opinion of the undersigned that the object sighted was an unidentified aerial phenomenon, and does not appear to conform to any known aircraft or other aerial vehicle.

RE: UFO

Dear Sirs:

Upon making inquiry to the P. I. C. at Patrick Air Force Base, it was indicated your office.

On the night of August 18th, 1960, at 9:15 PM, a TS/T was observing the sky over the beach at Cape Canaveral. Suddenly, over the horizon, he observed a very bright light which was traveling in a northerly direction. This light was of an extremely clear brilliant white color, much brighter than any star or planet. It appeared to be approximately the size of the average star. 

The object maintained this brightness and appearance for approximately two minutes, then it began to slowly fade until it was no longer visible. There was no noise or smoke trail associated with this object. 

As the observer stated, this was an extremely clear night, and the object was easily observed against the dark sky. He is a fully qualified TS/T who has had many years of experience in observing and identifying aircraft in night sky operations. 

I trust that I have furnished the pertinent information on this incident. If you require any additional information, please let me know.

Your cooperation in making any information you may have available will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

UFO Report (nr

SAFOI-3d (L/Col Tacker)
1. Reference attached letter to USAF from Mr. dated 2 September 1960, and DD Form 2$$ from SAFOI-3d to ATIC requesting information on the UFO case described in above letter.
2. The following answers correspond to the specific questions contained in the referenced letters:
a. VG reports have reached ATIC for 19 August 1960, which parallel this case. 
b. Due to the limited data in this case it is impossible to reach a positive conclusion. There are several possible explanations to account for the observations. This is not unusual when dealing with physical experiences; the UFO being, in lay terms, the results of some phenomenon that is not fully understood when some has is experiencing some degree of excitement.
c. The shadow of the moon is along cone approximately 22,100 miles in length. The area under the shadow length is due to the difference in size of the moon and the sun. Since the moon is always present, it is not always directly evident to us here on earth because of the normal lighting conditions under which it is portrayed (we are able to see evidence of it during phases other than full moon because portions of the moon not lighted by the sun are faintly illuminated by the earth).
d. While full moon the surface of the moon will at least in part be illuminated, when the sun, the earth, and the moon are in a line this illumination is at a minimum (known as a new moon). The average length of the moon's shadow is 232,100 miles. The average distance between the earth and moon is approximately 238,000 miles.

- page 12 -

The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report. There is no human face visible in the image.

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

reach the earth; however, due to the eccentricities of the orbits, the distance between the moon and earth may vary up to 250,000 miles and at times we are close enough for the shadow to be cast upon the earth. The ratio between the diameter of the moon and its distance from the earth is very small, approximately 1/400. The ratio of the diameter of Rcho to its distance is approximately 1/500,000. The ratio of the diameter of Aeho to its distance is ast by 1/500,000. An angular mieasurement of 1.52 seconds of arc, the diameter of Aeho as seen from the earth, is far short of reaching the critical limit of 5 seconds of arc required for viewing with the naked eye.

Echo: The subtending an angle of 3.91 seconds is below the level of visibility to the human eye. Consequently, the angular image of the echo is not visible to seeing sunlight reflected from a mirror which, in itself, is too small to be seen at the same distance. This is why the Air Force puts a reflector on the satellite for signaling.

3. The information was correct concerning his thoughts about the relationship of the echo to the earth's surface as given when an observer can see any of the surface from which light is reflected, as in the case of the moon, then there exists an angle between the observer, the object, and the light source such that any prime shadow cast by the object can be observed. The Air Force have, on other occasions, seen objects reported to the Air Force which have, on other occasions, been confirmed to be real, but a prime cause of these sightings is misidentification of high flying aircraft. The sightings, in the past, have resulted in misidentification when the metallized surface of the satellite becomes visible as to dazzling or reflecting sunlight.

23 September 1960

Dear _____,

This is to acknowledge your letter of 2 September 1960 concerning the satellite and the unidentified flying object you saw on 15 August 1960.

We reported have reached the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center for 15 August 1960 which parallel the circumstances as spelled out by you.

Yes, there did cast a shadow on the night of 13 August 1960; however, our analysis indicates this shadow was that of the moon itself, not that of a satellite or unidentified flying object. Therefore, this correspondence:

Due to the related data submitted with your writing, it is impossible to reach a positive conclusion. Therefore, I am including an Air Force questionnaire for your completion, as it will help the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for their analysis and evaluation.

The object in our skies with which we are familiar is the moon. This fact is supported by the evidence that the average distance between the earth and the moon is 239,000 miles on 15 August 1960. The angular size of the moon is about 0.5 degrees, and therefore the diameter of the moon's shadow upon the earth is approximately 7 miles. This size of the moon's shadow is in full accord with the observations you have described. There are no evidence of it during phases other than full moon because portions of the moon's disk are illuminated but some obscured. The fact that more of the moon's disk was illuminated at the time of your observation is significant, as it precluded the moon's shadow from being dense enough to the plane of the ecliptic to be at least part of the shadow you observed. Calculations show the distance between the earth and the moon on 15 August 1960 was 239,000 miles. The average distance between the earth and the satellite is approximately 22,300 miles. Considering the size of the moon's shadow as compared to the size of a satellite's shadow, it is obvious that the object you observed was the shadow of the moon and not that of a satellite. The ratio between the diameter of the moon's shadow and that of a satellite's shadow is in the order of 35 to 1. The distance between the moon and the earth is 239,000 miles. The distance between a satellite and the earth is in the order of 22,300 miles. A representation of 3.01 seconds arc which has a physical size of approximately 3.5 miles on the earth's surface. This is larger than the size of meteorological satellites.

The image does not contain any photographs, only a typed letter from Lawrence J. Tacker of the Public Information Division, Office of Information of the U.S. Air Force.

Letter to Mr. ____
Echo submitting an angle of 3.91 seconds is below the level of resolution capabilities (Echoes greater than 4.4 seconds are actually seeing the light reflected from the surface of the satellite). This is comparable to the faintest reflections obtained from a mirror which, under ideal conditions, can be used as mirrors for signaling in survival kits.

You were obviously correct in your thoughts about the relationship of your person to any shadow cast by Echo on the night of 17 August 1960. As you have already recognized, any of the surface from which its signal originate would not fall upon the observer.

There have, on other occasions, been objects attributed to the Air Force which were in conjunction with Echo, but as yet no data has been obtained to permit identification. The most probable cause of these sightings is misidentification of high flying jet aircraft at night illuminated by the satellite as to distance and velocity.

STATEMENT

Transcript of the sighting of the Nava Air Station, Virginia on 17 August 1960 by 1/Lt Francis G Proctor and S/Sgt John L Bowen. 

The base 2260 section, under the supervision of 1/Lt Francis G Proctor and S/Sgt John L Bowen, observed an object that appeared to be an aircraft with equipment which was designed as an attempt to identify the object. No missiles, rockets or other equipment were fired at the object.
Other marking appeared but no way of associating their meaning with the object.
The tube like containes aluminum strips which resumed was used. The tubing or the other attached equipment. The center section was protected from possible shock by very light material taped and bralled to the tube. Other than positive analysis of the object seemed to have been one of no consequence. The main objects is believed to still be handled very carefully until contents of the center section is known.
