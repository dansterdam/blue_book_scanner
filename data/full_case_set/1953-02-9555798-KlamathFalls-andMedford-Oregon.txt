The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

I. Description of Incident
A round red stationary object was sighted by a CAA operator for 10 minutes. The object tended to fade in and out intermittently and eventually faded out completely. The observer estimated the unknown to be at a 5700-6000' altitude and at a distance of 10,000 ft. The time of sighting consisted of scattered clouds at 2500' with 10 miles visibility.

II. Evaluation of Incident
The Project Blue Book and its contract astronomer evaluate this report as definitely caused by the astronomical body Venus. Many similar reports have been received by CAA/ATIC-filtering personnel. These appear to be Venus, causing an object to appear intermittently, and almost all such reports have been found to be Venus.

It is interesting to note in this and other similar observations that experienced CAA and Air Force personnel have been understandably confused by this true planet, comparatively isolated, low on the horizon and sometimes through a high haze limiting a rapid change in color. And is the color often seen through a rapid change in color.

III. Conclusion
Was Venus.
