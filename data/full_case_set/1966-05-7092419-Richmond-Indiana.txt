34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 5 June 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
THE OBJECTS (SIGHTINGS) WERE NOT OF AN AIRPLANE OR HELICOPTER AND WERE NOT CONNECTED TO THE GROUND. I TRIED TO COMPARE THEM TO OBJECT IN THE AREA. AT SOME DISTANCE OR ALTITUDE, COULD BE CONSIDERED "LIGHTS". THESE "LIGHTS" WERE TOO BRIGHT TO BE AN AIRPLANE, THE CORRECT RUNNING LIGHTS DID NOT EXIST. THE "LIGHTS" WERE NOT OF A CUSTOMARY AVIATION NATURE AS THEY HAD NO RELATION TO THE GROUND TO THE WARNING LIGHTS ATTACHED TO THEM AS I TRAVELED OVER 80 MPH ALONG A ROAD. ONCE WE STOPPED, THE "LIGHTS" OR ONE LIGHT FOR OVER 30 MINUTES, WHILE I SAW ONLY THE LAST 5 MINUTES OF ITS MOVEMENT AND WHILE I WAS STOPPED AND MY WINDOW ROLLED DOWN. IF YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION, FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME SINCERELY YOURS, [redacted]

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten letter or document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document reads:

Dear Jim,

While travel on U.S. Route 70 on Friday, May 20, 1966 at about 10:30 P.M. I saw two unusual bright lights over Richmond.

Indicating, I showed one of the lights to my wife, and they were not there long -- the lights seemed to disappear quite rapidly. The lights appeared to be very high and distant, and on a direct course toward the east.

'52 was close and light which may have been aircraft, could be explained away as to the origin of the lights I saw.

There are a few of the facts about the flight which I have witnessed, and I understand and verify the action.
