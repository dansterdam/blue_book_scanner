Text transcribed from the image:

IT IS REQUESTED THAT EXTREME CARE BE EXERCISED IN HANDLING OF THIS REPORT, AND THAT IT BE RETAINED WITHIN THE AGENCY TO WHICH IT IS ADDRESSED.

THE INCIDENT DESCRIBED HEREIN IS REPORTED AS HAVING OCCURRED ON 25 JUNE 1957, IN THE VICINITY OF TEHRAN, IRAN, APPROXIMATELY 25 NAUTICAL MILES NORTH OF TEHRAN, AT GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES 40N 53E. THE REPORT WAS PREPARED BY CAPTAIN MAHMOUD REZA TOLOUI, IIAF (IRANIAN IMPERIAL AIR FORCE), AFTER A DEBRIEFING OF SEVERAL IRANIAN AIR FORCE PERSONNEL WHO WITNESSED THE INCIDENT.

CAPTAIN TOLOUI'S REPORT STATES THAT AT APPROXIMATELY 0130 HOURS, 25 JUNE 1957, TWO IRANIAN AIR FORCE F-86 SABRE JET INTERCEPTORS WERE SCRAMBLED FROM THE TEHRAN MILITARY AIRFIELD TO INVESTIGATE AN UNIDENTIFIED LUMINOUS OBJECT IN THE SKY. THE PILOTS REPORTED THAT UPON REACHING AN ALTITUDE OF 25,000 FEET, THEY SIGHTED THE OBJECT WHICH THEY DESCRIBED AS A ROUND, BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT, MUCH LARGER THAN A STAR AND BRIGHTER THAN THE PLANET VENUS. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY.

WHEN THE LEAD PILOT ATTEMPTED TO INTERCEPT THE OBJECT, HIS AIRCRAFT ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND ENGINE MALFUNCTIONED AND HE WAS FORCED TO ABANDON HIS INTERCEPT. THE OBJECT THEN BEGAN EMITTING RAYS OF COLORED LIGHTS AND RAPIDLY CHANGING COLORS. IT THEN SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW AT A TREMENDOUS SPEED. THIS INCIDENT WAS WITNESSED BY SEVERAL IRANIAN AIR FORCE PERSONNEL AND MILITARY OFFICERS ON THE GROUND.

THE REPORT FURTHER STATES THAT LATER, WHEN THE MALFUNCTIONING F-86 RETURNED TO BASE, A MAINTENANCE CHECK REVEALED NO APPARENT MECHANICAL DEFECT IN THE AIRCRAFT, AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO SERVICE. THEY ADDED THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE OBJECT WAS A WEATHER BALLOON, AIRCRAFT, OR ANY OTHER KNOWN OBJECT.

IT SEEMS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT CONTACT COULD BE MADE WITH THE OBJECT AS NO EQUIPMENT WAS APPARENTLY DAMAGED AND NO PERSONNEL WERE INJURED. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS REPORT IS RESTRICTED AND PASSAGED [sic] BY INFORMATION TO RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES ONLY.
