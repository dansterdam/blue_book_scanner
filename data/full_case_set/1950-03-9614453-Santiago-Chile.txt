The bottom portion of the document contains an image that appears to be a grainy, monochromatic picture. Due to its quality and the lack of distinct features, it's difficult to ascertain exactly what is depicted in the image. It seems like a blurred or noisy photograph that might represent the sky or a similarly uniform background, but without clear details, no specific subject is recognizable.

Country: Chile
Report No. IR-42-50
AF-156200-1
Subject: Flying Discs
From: Air Attache, Chile
Date of Report: 30 Mar 50
Date of information: current
Evaluator: 
Prepared by: Harry L. Mitchell, Major, USAF
Source: Newspaper reports and personal observations of Air Attache Office personnel.

1. Flying discs are being "seen" in various parts of Chile. First sighting was at Punta Arenas, lat 53°06' S, long 70°53'W on 11 Mar at noon. Many inhabitants of the city witnessed this phenomena which appeared northeast of the city and traveled toward the southwest. Usual description was given—extreme altitude, silver in color, shaped like a ping-pong ball. The Director of the Observatorio Astronomio de the University of Chile, Prof. Frederico Rutland, made a statement to the local press that what the people were seeing was the planet Venus which is clearly visible this time of year at that latitude.

2. Second sighting of a disc took place in the Santiago area, San Bernardo and Valparaiso on the 24th and 25th of March with the usual description given by the populace being quoted in the local press.

3. Third sighting of a disc occurred 28 March between 1330 and 1410 over Santiago, Chile. Downtown area was crowded with people looking into the sky observing this phenomenon. M/Sgt. *atterson, 6249735, assigned to this office as a 502, personally observed an object travelling at an extreme rate of speed and altitude. (See
attached statement and diagram.)

COMMENT: On 29 March this observer saw a silver colored, stationary object in the same relative position as was witnessed by the local populace the preceding day; and after careful observation Concluded it to be the planet Venus and not a flying disc.

Professor Rutland (par 1) repeated his statement to the press today that the object had to be Venus.

Local press has headlined "flying disc" dispatches from all countries reporting sightings.

STATEMENT

On the 28 Mar 50 at approximately 1430 hours I was returning from my home
at 1057 Vitacura to the U.S. Embassy for the afternoon's work period. I noticed
numerous persons outside looking at the sky enroute to the U.S. Embassy, I did not
stop or talk to anyone until I arrived at the U.S. Embassy. I immediately came to the
9th floor and started looking out of the window. Northing was sighted.  I then decided
to go to the roof of the Embassy building, I borrowed from the U.S. Navy Attache a
pair of field glasses and proceeded to the top of the Embassy building with the sole 
thought in mind that I would discover some illusion, perhaps a cloud wisp or a
reflection from an object and thereby convince myself that there was nothing present
in the sky. I was on the roof of the U.S. Embassy for approximately one hour and was
constantly scanning the sky with both my normal eyes and with the field glasses. At
approxmiately 1515 hours I detected an object travelling from south to north at an
extraordinary altitude and at an extreme rate of speed. I detected this object with my
naked eye and was then able to look at it through the field glasses. The height of
the object made it impossible to determine any details about it other than what it
appeared to be moving in a straight line. It appeared to be more white than any other
color. I watched the object move approximately 30 degrees of sky within 5-10 seconds
then decided that I would return to the office and procure a camera with a telephoto
lense and attempt to get a spot on a piece of film to support my story. I returned
to the roof of the U.S. Embassy with a camera equipped with a telephoto lense and
was unable to spot the object again. The small graph is furnished in relation to point
of sight and the object seen in relation to the sun.

The image provided appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch rather than a photograph. The sketch includes a top-down view of a building labeled "Roof of Embassy" and an adjacent smoke stack with an arrow pointing to its shadow. There are annotations indicating the observer's positions at two different times, marked "1" and "2," respectively, alongside two "X" marks purportedly representing the positions of the object sighted. There's also some mathematical annotations apparently relating to angles of sight.
