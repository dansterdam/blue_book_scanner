PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 11-6-57
2. LOCATION: Balmorhea, Texas
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 0605
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: G-Ground-Radar
5. DURATION: 30/45 min.
6. SOURCE: Civilian
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30/45 min.
8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: One to two large, bright, steady objects observed on radar, traveling 1,000 mph about 20 miles distant, elevation about 70 degrees, descending to about 45 degrees, then accelerating out of range. Observations confirmed by three operators.
9. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1-2
10. COURSE: Descending
11. COMMENTS: The observations were made on an air traffic control radar set. The objects were seen at an altitude of 30,000 feet, descending to 20,000 feet, and then accelerating out of range. The blips on the radar scope were unusually bright and steady, not like the usual flickering of aircraft returns. The operators were highly experienced and familiar with the capabilities of the equipment. They reported that the movements and other characteristics of the objects were unlike anything they had previously encountered on the radar. The data obtained appears to be of investigative value.
