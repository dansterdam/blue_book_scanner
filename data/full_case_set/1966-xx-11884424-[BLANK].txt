MEMO FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: Implementing SAB Ad Hoc Committee on Project Blue Book Recommendations

1. The following personnel met at 1400 on 19 April in Room 2C1052 to discuss how to implement the recommendations made by the Ad Hoc Committee to review Project Blue Book.
Dr. Jesse Orlansky, AFRSA
COL ROBERT HIPPLER, AFRSA

2. On 5 April 1966, Secretary of the Air Force Harold Brown, in a memorandum to the Chief of Staff, stated that the Committee's recommendations should be accepted and arrangements made for the scientific team to investigate in depth certain selected sightings of UFOs. (General Depugeau was given responsibility for implementing the Committee's recommendations and Lt Colonel Hippler is project officer.

3. Although the Committee's recommendation was clear and succinct, initially there was no unanimous agreement on how to put this recommendation into effect. A basic question is:
(1) Should the contract or university or individuals connected with a university? A great deal of the existing was discussions with these facets of the problem and a clear answer did not evolve. Therefore, it is probable that the Committee may be asked to meet with Colonel Hippler again.

Generally, the contract or university (or individuals from universities) is good. Specifically, however, there needs to be a list of university to coordinate and evaluate investigations. After some discussion, it was suggested that the University of Dayton is probably most appropriate because it is located close to HQ USAF who will retain management of Project Blue Book. Other universities were considered that could provide program or technical assistance.

Colonel Hippler pointed out that it will probably be September before the Air Force replies to the request by Dr. O'Connelly regarding the use of his case. Colonel Hippler should make a copy of this case.

Since we are dealing with an emotional phenomenon, there was a discussion about whether universities are willing to get involved with UFOs. Dr. O'Brien suggested that Dr. Condon of the Aerospace Technology Division at Boulder consult with several university presidents with whom he is acquainted to get some ideas on how we can avoid when contacting other universities.

There are still several unanswered questions or problem areas:
(a) Since the problem is 99% public relations, it is essential that the advertising concerning UFOs must be properly handled. It is proposed that information regarding unsolved cases shall be included on the first few investigation teams. This caused quite a bit of discussion and the answer does not evolve.
(b) The objective is to have impartial scientists from schools with good reputations that have never been involved with UFOs.
(c) Considerable thought must be given to how the contract or contracts are to be written.
(a) In order to utilize their talents to the best advantage, professor and assistant Defense-Advisor teams to work with HQ USAF must be selected. These include Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Dr. McDonald Wexler.
(e) When teams are selected, it is strongly recommended that they be thoroughly briefed on what is expected of them. This briefing covers all of the investigations and publicity that must be evolved in order to give good Air Force public relations.

The discussion question that was not fully resolved is how AFSG should get into the act. The Committee's original thought was that we would AFSG work with the investigators. The Committee also recommended that a member of the OSI might work with the university teams and others during the benefit of their experience. It was questioned whether this would be advisable or not as the Air Force effort should not be involved.

6. Results:

It is expected that the university findings, resulting from investigations of certain unidentified flying objects, may indicate that the USAF UFO program as at present is to increase the efforts, or to decrease the efforts, and also to determine the credibility of the findings.

It is hoped that better public understanding will result in investigations of the several problems that a scientific investigation may make a spectacular, but difficult to estimate, out of this investigation which can produce a great wave of public interest and confidence in the program.

c. It is possible that there exist some phenomena that may be of interest for investigation by current university or government research organizations and that a better understanding of these phenomena should not be neglected in the investigation of the UFO problem.

IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 9, 1966

AIR FORCE TO CONTRACT WITH SCIENTISTS
FOR UFO INVESTIGATIONS

The Air Force is taking steps to strengthen scientific investigations of reports of sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFO).

The help of more individuals within the scientific community is being sought through contracts calling for prompt, in-depth investigations of selected UFO reports. Air Force officials are now discussing the interest with university and other scientific leaders to determine the most effective approach.

The decision to award the contracts was based on a recommendation by the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board which reviewed the methods and findings of Project Blue Book - the Air Force program to investigate and evaluate UFO reports.

In its report, which was submitted to the Air Force in March, the investigating committee recommended expanding the program to include investigations of selected sightings by independent scientists. The report also concluded that there has been no evidence that unidentified flying objects are a threat to national security, and commended the Air Force for its organization of Project Blue Book.

The Air Force is preparing work statements for the new contracts. Funds for them will be requested from FY 67 and FY 68 budgets.

COMMENTARY ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
(CASE HISTORY)

HUNTLEY-BRINKLEY (Cont'd)
Circa 6:40 PM CMST 1 March 1966 on the CBS TV News -
"CHIEF HUNTLEY: This appears to be from Hicn. to Mich. from
Harding to Red Wing, Minnesota. Flashes of light were seen going
upwards and then downwards near a small town named 1LCA. The
sightings would simply perplex the local PEOPLE in the MINNESOTA
town. This type of incident is being investigated in
the AF in the MINNESOTA area. The Air. Force says this
light seen by a number of . people in the area
apparently is not related to anything known at this time.
Whatever it was, it remained a mystery.
BRINKLEY: And we don't know. Apparently, we don't know how many
PAVNS are there. We just don't know.
HUNTLEY: And the, fight, And the, lit, And the PILOTS who reported
seeing them last night to the FAA in those areas, they just don't know
how many FAVNS are there. We just don't know. We'll have to wait
for the Air Force to support them with further explanation to see
what the PAVNS are."

BURLINGTON: What all have you got there?

HUNTLEY: BURLINGTON: We had a report of some kind of flash in the
sky in the BURLINGTON area. Are you, a, little .car baffled on
that?

BURLINGTON: Now, this is your first reaction, HUNTLEY. We
have nothing to report here in BURLINGTON on UFO sightings.
We had no reports whatsoever. There were approximately
two and a half seconds of a bright flash here, but that's
all we know.

HUNTLEY: BURLINGTON: And what was your reaction to that?

BURLINGTON: Well, I'm scared, damned scared. I'm, I'm
really concerned, we're all, in this position, frankly,
damned scared right now. But we know we can't panic.

HUNTLEY: This BURLINGTON: And there, . and the helicopter pockets
pounded the air... We know that somehow we are all living
with a situation that has great mystery to it. And
if there are any unidentified flying objects in the
sky, that are not just part of the planet we living from,
then find feeling from three sides, scared, you bet your
life we are. Were found in the VC position along
with half a dozen others. Were found there. The entire
platoon was hit hard. There was an intense barrage._
The snipers had obviously zeroed in on the platoon there.
There had been evacuated during the last operation. Those
who were left survived. But we know, we just plain and
simple don't know how to evaluate all this.

HUNTLEY: Villages this time. One hamlet was evacuated
and supposedly surrounded. We just plain simply don't
know how to evaluate all of this. BURLINGTON: And
right, and supposedly surrounded.

AFR 80-17
10 aircraft. Except as aircraft are determined to be natural or known, the Air Force will conduct investigations, within the limits of the "Air Force Technical Order Regulation", to determine the nature and identity of UFO's. The Air Force will make use of all available information in connection with these facts are forwarding through channels for Scientific analysis and that the results of this scientific analysis are forwarded for eventual action, where the regulations dictate that information should be forwarded further, or require special handling by the Air Force.
EXCEPTIONS: STD at Wright-Patterson AFB. The Air Force Capt in charge of UFO program may conduct any other investigations for special or technical reasons or when additional technical data seem essential, and (2) for analysis of any UFO sightings when results of investigations or other information indicates a TECHNICAL REASON for special investigation by STD. The main purpose of AFR 80-17 is to establish uniform procedures and insure adequate investigation of each sighting, so that proper scientific analysis can be made. STD will NOT disseminate information concerning UFO sightings to Government agencies, companies, or individuals, except as required by this regulation.
Section B - Public Relations SECTION: RELATED INFORMATION AND CONTACT:
The Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, the Project Bluebook Monitor, The Deputy Chief of Staff for Research and Development, the Commanding General of the Air Materiel Command, and others will support the program with current technological experience and continued cooperation. The Air Force desires maximum cooperation with scientists outside the Project Blue Book effort. Other Government agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency, may assist in this program. Interested Government agencies will be given the results of the Air Force investigations to aid in analyzing and determining the nature of the reported phenomena. All Air Force personnel will cooperate fully in furnishing information, evidence, and assistance relating to the UFO program. The regulations will forbid Air Force personnel from discussing UFO cases except with properly cleared personnel who have a definite need-to-know. Release of information to the public and to the news media will be handled solely by the Office of Information Services.

MEMORANDUM FOR MILITARY DIRECTOR, SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)

Reference is made to our previous correspondence on this subject dated September 24, 1954.

The attached Wall Street Journal story of December 13, 1966, is an account of the relative decline in UFO sightings. We expect that a further decrease in such sightings will occur.

TEXT EXTRACTION:

The Old Question: Do Flying Saucers Exist?
From the Stars, Says "Yes"
According to a statement made recently by Mr. Julian Whipple, the Science Director of the Harvard Observatory, the old question of whether or not flying saucers exist still remains unanswered. He said, "We have seen so many objects in the sky that could not be easily identified that there is evidence that some such things as flying saucers exist."

Mr. Whipple was among a group of scientists who have expressed definite opinions that such unidentified flying objects do exist and he indicated that many eminent astronomers and other scientists are convinced that they have seen strange objects in the sky.

The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) has collected many reports from reliable witnesses, including pilots, military personnel and others, indicating the existence of strange flying objects. The sightings have come from every part of the world and have been reported by responsible individuals who have no reason to fabricate stories. The Air Force Project Blue Book is continuously analyzing all reports of unidentified flying objects.

Some of these reports are quite definite and descriptive. For example, the crew of a Northwest Airlines plane reported seeing an object the size of a B-47 bomber which maneuvered above them at an estimated speed of 4,500 mph. The object was observed for several minutes. Other pilots have reported seeing objects that performed aerial maneuvers impossible for any known aircraft. The pilots are convinced they saw something completely foreign to any aircraft with which they are familiar.

The only point that seems to be debated is the nature of these flying objects. There are many theories - some say they are interplanetary vehicles, while others suggest they are some form of natural phenomenon as yet unknown to science. The Air Force apparently has no definite explanation for many of the UFO sightings, but continues to investigate all reliable reports.

Whether these objects represent visitors from another planet or are some form of unusual natural phenomena, the fact remains that experienced and reliable observers have seen these strange objects under conditions which make their reports highly impressive. The mystery continues.

Dear Major Steiner:

With reference to the meeting at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, there are several reports of ATIC, Project Blue Book, or related groups which would be available for inspection and discussion at that time:

(1) The report of the 21 April 1955 events at Kelly-Oakville, Kentucky, (2) the report of the alleged Brazilian naval incident of March 1958, and (3) the February 1949 report of Project Sign's unidentified flying objects. I would be glad to discuss these and other matters with you at your convenience.

With best wishes,

Cordially,

Dear Dr. Cacioppo,

I am enclosing communication from Dr. Carl Sagan who is a member of the SAB Ad Hoc Committee on UFOs. Dr. Sagan has looked into the UFO matter and several items he thinks would be fruitful for the Committee to discuss at the 3 February meeting. I have cleared with Dr. O'Brien and we will appreciate your assembling these case histories and reports and making them available to Dr. Sagan and the Committee.

If the reports are not classified it might be advantageous to loan them to Dr. Sagan so he can review them prior to the meeting.

Sincerely,
