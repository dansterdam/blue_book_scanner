The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows an object in the sky above the horizon. The second sketch shows a larger view of the area where the object was observed, with the object's position marked as "A". The third sketch shows a smaller, more distant view of the landscape.

The text in the document reads as follows:

32. The following sketch suggests that whatever the object was it was above the horizon (sky) when you first saw it, and a "B" on the same curved line suggests how high the object was above the horizon (sky) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
