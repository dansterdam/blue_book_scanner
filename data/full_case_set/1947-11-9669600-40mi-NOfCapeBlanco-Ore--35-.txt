With the incidents thus eliminated, there remain fifty-three which contain some evidence but have no apparent ready explanation. This statement is true only under the assumption that the evidence is accepted as reliable and accurate. When physiological and psychological factors are taken into consideration, all of those still unexplained can tentatively be ascribed to one of these factors or a combination thereof.

Air Material Command Appraisal of Incidents (See 
212 incidents considered)

There are sufficient physiological explanations for the 
unexplained flying exlanations to provide a plausible explanation 
for most of them, the job is big, the problems inherently are diffi- 
cult to solve mainly from inability to estimate speed, distance, 
size.

All of the remaining 53 incidents are treated in detail in 
report, 212 incidents were no problem. In regard to size, at 
75' or 75,000' or diameter of craft in question. Time lapse is important 
view time is important time was confused by error loop together 
probably 2 or more by, been one isolated unusual or regarded
anom is relatively.

Analysis of ATIC Evalutation of Remaining Reports

IX

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix III) exhibit 
a common characteristic. Two of them, by sightableness of their 
pilot, might have been an ho2. One witness saw most of that in. 

(Additional, 171), not were distributed without pattern 
throughout the United States. A few were outside the U.S. No two 
descriptions or appearances or performances were exactly alike. The now 
and sighting occurred at various times of day and years.

APPENDIX II

Incidents in Air Force files, each incident considered sepa- 
rately, it is not the intent to quantify the number of observers, but each case was unidentifiable according 
to this criteria of judgement. The numerical designation is merely the seque- 
tial no. of the incident in the project files.

UNCLASSIFIED

incident #35 -- off coast of Oregon -- 12 November 1947

The information given here is too meager for a definite
conclusion to be drawn concerning the identity of the object ob-
served. It is probable, however, that they were two parts of a
meteor that had broken upon entrance into the earth's atmosphere.
The length of time in sight is unusual, perhaps, but one wonders whether
this might not have been grossly overestimated for psychological
reasons. Otherwise, the scanty description favors the meteoric hy-
pothesis.

The image is a scanned page, and it appears to be mostly text-based with no clear photographs visible. However, due to the low resolution and the quality of the scan, it is difficult to discern detailed content. The text itself is heavily obscured by markings, possibly redactions, making it mostly illegible. Due to these obstructions and the overall poor quality of the image, performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to accurately reproduce the text is not feasible. The visible portions of the text include fragmented sentences and words, with most of the context and content being unreadable. If you have a clearer image or require a specific section to be deciphered, please provide it, and I will do my best to assist.
