Gobshite and I were on our monthly fly home hunting trip. Some snoozing around this morning. Some red glowing around 10 got up took a walk out in a field in front of house, saw unidentified object hovering about 25 ft above ground about 300 yds south it made no sound seemed to hover for 2 to 3 minutes then just took off and disappeared. It seemed to have lights around edge and a light underneath in the center and seemed to be moving very fast when it took off. It seemed to take off up and back toward the east at a high rate of speed. When it took off it seemed to wobble or rock as it moved and noticed no exhaust. It was dark out and hard to make out exact shape but seemed to be round or oblong in shape. No other witnesses as far as I know.

Transcribing the text:

to ascertain if we could identify and possibly obtain a specimen of the object seen by the witness. I was advised by the witness that he had no such specimen to offer and that he did not have any photographs. I personally examined the site where the object was reported to have landed, but found no physical evidence to substantiate the report. The witness was unable to furnish any additional details regarding the object or its movements other than that reported earlier. I have therefore concluded that this report lacks sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation and recommend that it be classified as an INSUFFICIENT DATA case.

AF DISCOVERER VII IN ORBIT; RECAPTURE OF CONE SET TODAY

GEAR WEATHERPROOFED TO FACILITATE RETURN

VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, CALIF., NOV. 7-(UPI)- The "weatherproof" Discoverer VII satellite, successfully launched for a significant U.S. satellite breakthrough, roared into orbit today.

Unlike previous satellites in the Discoverer series, this vehicle carried special equipment, including heaters, insulation, and sheaves, that should permit the recovery of its "cone" after re-entry.

The cone, a small re-entry capsule attached to the 1,370-pound satellite, is expected to be recovered this afternoon by planes and ships in a massive "fishing" mission in the Pacific ocean, southeast of Hawaii, 2,800 miles from the launch site.

The vehicle, weighing nearly a. 700-pound total, was boosted into a 133-by-322-mile orbit late yesterday by a Thor-Agena rocket.

THE AIR FORCE announced that their "advanced" satellite had been placed successfully in orbit. 

The recovery attempt was scheduled in U.S. government projection to be completed within 24 hours of the launch.

"This achievement is the next step in setting man into space," an Air Force spokesman said, "and it puts the U.S. satellite program in a long lead before we can send a man into space."

The Air Force said the 'Discoverer VII" satellite was launched Aug. 19 and since that time 21 engineers have worked continually to insure its chance of success.

"When we do catch this thing, and it very well could be insane," the spokesman said, "What we'll have addition to the 'world's first' will be very limited scientific information from the interior of the satellite."

The text describes the details of the rocket launch, including the mission objectives, the agencies involved, and the potential applications of the data collected from the experiment.

U.S. Fires Research Rocket
3-Stage Missile Goes 150 Miles Into Atmosphere
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10--(UP)--A five-stage Army research rocket successfully fired 150 miles into the upper atmosphere today.
The rocket, launched by the Army Ordnance Missile Laboratories, reached an altitude of over 150 miles, it was announced. This is believed to be the highest altitude ever attained by a U.S. missile.
The vehicle was launched by the Army in cooperation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to measure atmospheric densities. The data would be valuable in the intercontinental ballistic missile and satellite programs.
The five-stage missile, smaller than a five-story building, was developed at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, Redstone Arsenal, Ala. It was used for satellite launching and military shots of intercontinental ballistic missiles.
The rocket was fired at 7 a.m. and finally plunged into the Atlantic Ocean about 300 miles away from the launching site. The rocket was designed to reach an altitude of 150 miles.
IN ANNOUNCING the shoot, the Defense Department said the experiment was planned by various agencies in connection with the U.S. program for the International Geophysical Year cooperation in 1959. Information on the experiment will be made available to all nations participating in the international geophysical year program.

To William J. Mayny
A friend of mine had a strange experience with me the night of the flying saucer or whatever crashed on highway 2i just south of West Branch. We was on highway 2i and 15 at 9:15 pm. There was about eight of us in the car. We seen the thing coming down the highway at a great rate of speed and when it got just this side of us it seemed to settle slowly and settle right on the highway. There was a great glow to it and small bright objects started coming out of it. They seemed to be larger than any you've ever seen flying around with no noise and up and down through the whole works. It looked as though it was 25 to 30 feet across or more. They glowed red. We stood there with our mouths open and watched the whole performance. I have never seen anything like it before. They glowed red. We thought of the possibility of it being a machine or some kind of an aircraft or something and the way the smaller objects came out of it and did things made us wonder. There were only three in itas near as we could tell. When it straightened out and started up the highway slowly we all jumped in the car and took off like a rocket. We was scared stiff. 
This must have been about a quarter of a mile from where it crashed and about the same distance from us. It seemed to light up the whole countryside. It settled right on the highway, then straightened out and started up the highway real slow.
There was some of the people in the car that seemed to have been affected in some way by it. They had a funny feeling and a strange sensation in their heads and it didn't seem to wear off for quite a while. Some of them thought they would never get over it. The others was just plain scared to death. I was more interested in it than scared although I don't know why.
This was Saturday night November 29, 1958. I thought I would give you the details of what we saw as I am sure it will be of interest to you.

Sodium Cloud Shot Lights
Dust's Sky
Space Agency Rocket
Ejects Vapors Seen
Hundreds Of Miles
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 - (UP) -
A rocket-fired sodium cloud visible for hundreds of miles was spotted into the sky today from a rocket fired yesterday at the White Sands, N.M., proving ground of the air force and NACA, the National Advisory committee for Aeronautics.
Residents of Richmond, Va., more than 1900 miles away, reported seeing the cloud, which was not nearly as bright or large as the one sighted off for a similar experiment in August.
The US. Weather bureau at Richmond said that scores and dozens of telephone calls were received from excited persons who had seen the cloud and made one inquiry about it.
Lou Caekman, a newsman for station WRNL, who watched the shot, said the cloud appeared "perhaps a little smaller than a first quarter moon." It faded into the darkness within about 15 minutes, he said.
The experiment was designed to obtain information about the action of the upper atmosphere at high altitudes to the action of the gasses and vapors planned for this week's series of international rocket flights.
Within minutes after its firing at 5:57 a.m. the rocket shot the sodium cloud high into the sky, spreading it over a wide area.
The cloud is spotted at several points in Connecticut, Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina. Observers in some states said it appeared to have a little tail on it.
A similar shot was fired in New Mexico last Sept. 13. That was seen in Pennsylvania as far away as Massachusetts. 
The NACA conducted its first sodium cloud experiment Aug. 19. The sodium vapor was seen over a wide area.
NACA said the experiment was designed to obtain information on upper wind currents and atmospheric composition at high altitudes to aid in the design and to tear the rate of propellant vapors at high altitudes.
The cloud was ejected into the upper atmosphere by a Nike-ASP launching rocket equipped with a timing device. The rocket propelled the sodium vapor out to an altitude of 50 miles, continuing until it reached its mark of 130 miles.

Flotilla 
At Ready 
For Catch?

Hope to Snag
Discoverer VIII 
Capsule From Sky

VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif.-Nov. 17-a(AP)-a A flotilla of 6 naval ships and Air Force planes is ready to try to snare the Discoverer VIII satellite capsule from the sky after it comes down from orbit.

The capsule is expected to be over the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii in an area called "the splash zone"  The flotilla will be there waiting to try to catch it before it strikes the water.

If successful, this would be the first time a satellite has been recovered from space.

WITH THE LAUNCHING NEXT
America's hopes to become the first nation to capture a man-made object returning from space. It trails the Soviet Union, as far as launching satellites is concerned, 
The Air Force said that this effort is necessary step on the road toward orbiting a human being.

Discoverer VIII was scheduled to launch the regular some Tests earlier today. Five previous Discoverer shots have all failed.

The satellite is planned to snap the camera pictures of the U.S. and South Poles. Aircraft are planned to assist the flotilla in the Pacific in guiding the capsule back to earth while ships positioned to pick it up out of the water. 

The capsule, after it strikes the water, is expected to float. The satellite must be in position and stabilized prior to recovery.

"It was about this time that word got started that I had seen something strange in the sky. I was back and forth all day waiting for some evidence that anyone else had seen or noticed anything, but I never could find a single person who had. 

Seemed my sense of observance had become quite sharpened up and I had maybe seen things that weren't really there. Or could it be that I was the only one who had seen this thing?
