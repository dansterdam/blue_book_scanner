AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Flight 3-2, 4602D AISS 33-0708-1-56 Part 1 of 1 page
SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
1. A telephone call to the Burlington Airport control tower was made to determine if there were any aircraft in the area on the dates and times of sightings.
2. Phone call was made to the Burlington weather station. No balloons released were sighted on the dates and times in question. It is possible that balloons could have been released at some altitudes, but sightings on both dates were from the NW on both dates, and it was possible for balloons to travel from the north central part of the state into the area.
3. A check was made with the 764th ACAW Squadron, St. Albans, Vermont, intelligence personnel informed that no aircraft were scrambled or airborne from their station on the dates of the sightings, but no entries were made which would identify the objects sighted.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
It is felt the opinion of the Investigators, from facts obtained, that sightings were caused by a cluster of weather balloons, with intermittent flickering caused by reflection of sunlight.
The over report indicates the area where they were sighted. The weather station at Iunction, Vermont has no additional information beyond the items given in this report. (5 Copies) (2) Morris are the
COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sightings described in this report were caused by clusters of weather balloons. Could account for reports of "gondolas" beneath the objects.

II. RELIABILITY: Mr. Wilcox has no previous experience as a trained observer. He is apparently a reliable and intelligent source. He seemed quite positive in his testimony.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Mr. ------was on duty with the Morrisville Volunteer Fire Department at 2236 hours on 6 May 1956. The object was first noticed at approximately 2200 hours. It was described as a brilliant star-like object which appeared to be moving west to east. The light appeared yellowish-white and seemed to fluctuate in intensity. It was observed for about 10 minutes and then disappeared from view. The object was located approximately 35° above the horizon and 40° to the left of the centerline of the observer's position. The object seemed to move at a high rate of speed and covered approximately half the sky during the time of observation. The object appeared to move in a straight line. No sound was heard. The size of the object appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length (See Incl 1). One object moved behind a cloud and re-appeared. All objects were a brilliant white in color. 

Mr. Wilcox left his post at 2300 hours. EST, 6 May 1956. He was on his way home when he observed a second object in the same area of the sky. The object was moving north at the time of the sighting and observed only for a few seconds. It appeared slightly larger than the previous object and was a brilliant white in color. The second object moved very fast in a straight line from east to west.
