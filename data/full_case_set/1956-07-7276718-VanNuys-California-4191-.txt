The object was described as a large, round, bright light, moving in a horizontal direction and at a high rate of speed.

The object first appeared to be the size of a basketball at arm's length and gradually increased in size as it approached the witness.

The object was observed for approximately 2 minutes before it disappeared from view behind some trees.

The object was seen on a clear night with a few scattered clouds.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969. This appears to be a page from a report or document related to that program.

Here is the text from the document, as if it were produced by an OCR system:

THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS DESCRIBED AS A LARGE WHITE OBJECT LYING ON THE GROUND IN AN OPEN FIELD. THE OBJECT WAS APPROXIMATELY 15 FEET IN DIAMETER AND 6 FEET IN HEIGHT. IT HAD AN IRREGULAR SHAPE WITH A SMOOTH, SHINY SURFACE. 

THE WITNESS STATED THAT THE OBJECT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE OF HUMAN MANUFACTURE AND WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING HE HAD SEEN BEFORE. HE REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION OR LANDING GEAR ON THE OBJECT.

THE WITNESS FURTHER STATED THAT HE OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES BEFORE IT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED. HE COULD NOT DETERMINE HOW OR WHERE THE OBJECT WENT.

THE CASE IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE.
