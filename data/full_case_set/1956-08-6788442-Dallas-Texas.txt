Four round, white objects about size of a pea at arm's length, were flying in formation, one in lead and three behind. Objects came from Northeast flying south and orbited over area where observers were standing; the continued flight to Northwest where they faded, length of sighting was 6 minutes. Location of sighting was on the final approach for Love Field, Dallas.

COMMENTS
Duration of sighting, course and maneuvering of object, manner of disappearance, formation, and location of sighting (airfield) strongly indicate that aircraft were responsible for this sighting. Evaluation of the sighting is "probable aircraft".

FROM: DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE, HEADQUARTERS CONTINENTAL AIR DEFENSE COMMAND ENT AFB, COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT OVER THE WHITE ROCK LAKE, DALLAS, TEXAS

1. First report of UFOR was received by 1st Lt. William Applinghaum, Director on duty at the Duncanville, Texas Filter Center. The report stated that about 2200 hrs, 11 August 1956, a bright circular object was observed over the White Rock Lake area. The object was first sighted at about 45 degrees elevation going from East to West. It was described as a bright white circular object, approximately the size of a small automobile. It left no trail and emitted no sound. The object was under observation for about 20 to 30 seconds. The incident was passed to the Control Center at Duncanville. No further information was obtained and the object was not brought under control.

2. This report comes from civilian personnel. No other reports have been received to date.

2. LOCATION: Dallas, Texas
3. DASS-TIME GROUP: 2350
5. PHOTOS: D, yes, several
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3-5 min
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Two apparent-ly real sky objects appeared to be moving slowly at a considerable distance, with some changes in brightness and position. The objects appeared to be round in shape and did not blink or flash. They moved in straight lines, slowly and apparently level. No sound was heard.
11. COMMENTS: The astro charts b and 1 indicate the 'objects' were probably star(s). However, the observed movements and variation(s) in brightness do not correspond to normal stellar activity. The objects were at a considerable distance and moved slowly but erratically and with no blinking or flashing. It may be that an aircraft caused reflections or silhouette-like effects that gave the appearance of 'two objects' moving slowly across the sky.

The shared image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, titled "RADAR OBSERVATION DATA SHEET". The document contains a series of questions and answers related to detecting radar equipment.

I. QUESTIONS REGARDING DETECTING RADAR EQUIPMENT
1. What type radar equipment is involved? 275-429
2. Has there been any recent maintenance difficulties? If so, describe. None
3. What type modulator (i.e., spark gap, hard tube, etc.) is used in the radar equipment? Hydrostatic
4. Was the AFC (automatic frequency control) circuit of the receiver operating properly? Yes
5. Has interference from another radar set been observed recently, and are personnel familiar with the effects caused by an interfering signal? No
6. What type indicators, "A scope", "B scope", etc., were used to follow the target? PPI
7. What was the radar scan rate? 27/
8. What was the approximate frequency of the transmitter? 3,900 MC

II. GENERAL QUESTIONS
1. What were the general weather conditions at the time unidentified target was observed? Yes - 5, Clear
2. Other weather data from nearby weather stations is available on temperature vs altitude, humidity vs altitude, and wind velocity vs altitude? Humidity 50%, Visibility 30/40, 2 miles 30'
3. Was the target observed by any other nearby radar equipments? If so, give details. No
4. Are the operator and the supervisor familiar with the effects of anomalous (duct-effect) propagation as they pertain to this type radar? Yes

Page 2 of 3

(USE REVERSE SIDE OF SHEET IF MORE SPACE IS REQUIRED)
5. Has anomalous propagation been observed to extend the range of ground clutter by this radar at this site, and did this condition persist during or near the time of unknown target observation?
No

6. What effects of rain storms and lightning have been observed on this radar?
Unknown

7. Were any checks made to determine if unknown target could have been one of our own aircraft?
No

8. Was any interception attempted? If so, give details.
No, but Hobart 38, Baker-35 was asked to investigate, but the target disappeared before interception could be made.

9. Was a visual and/or Auditory observation made simultaneously with scope observation?
Negative. If so, give details described in paragraph 4 your observation.

III. SPECIFIC TARGET QUESTIONS
1. Did any technical personnel observe the unknown target on the Radar Scope?
No

2. Was a permanent record ("track") made of the target positions as they appeared on the indicators? If so, attach to this report. (Pilot on back of page 1.)
No

3. At what range, azimuth, altitude, and time was the target observed?
Unknown

4. How did the target appear in size and shape as compared with conventional aircraft targets?
The size of the radar scope paint was a least three times larger than normal aircraft.

5. Was the target of consistent size, or did it change rapidly?
Unknown

6. Was the speed of the target constant or variable? Explain.
Speed of target was constant at about 400 knots and seemed to have an erratic flight path.

7. Did the target appear "fuzzy" or clear and sharp as compared with a known aircraft target?
The target appeared clear and sharp.

8. What other (aircraft) targets were observed in the same general area, altitude, and time as the unknown target?
Only aircraft in area at about this time was Hobart 38, Baker 35 about 25 miles away from unknown target.
