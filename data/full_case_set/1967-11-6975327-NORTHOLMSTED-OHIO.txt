11 NOV 67 2/c2052
Source: Civilian
NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Two
LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3 Hours, 30 Minutes
TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
Course: NW
PHOTO: No
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: No
CONCLUSION: Probable (BALLOON)
BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
FAA radar painted a target that could be identified at that time, actually the object's was at an estimated 5,000 to 7,500 ft and 25 miles north of Erie. The radar controller felt that the target would have to have been quite high. Lost target about 20 miles NW of Buffalo.
COMMENTS: The controller thought that the object must have been a balloon but couldn't find the agency that launched it. The wind on the ground at 30,000 ft was blowing from 230 deg at about 51 MPH. It appears that the object was a balloon, however, the launch agency could not be located.

NORTHOLMSTED 
OHIO
On November 6, 1967 the Air Force received a report from a witness in North Olmsted, Ohio regarding an unidentified flying object. The witness described seeing a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving rapidly. The witness was unable to determine the size, shape, or altitude of the object. No further details were provided in the report.

The image appears to be a photograph of some kind of monument or statue, possibly a war memorial or monument. The statue appears to be on a tall pedestal or column, with what looks like a winged figure or angel at the top. The photograph is in black and white, with a slightly grainy or blurry quality to it, suggesting it may be an older document or image.

Now, as requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document labeled "MEMO FOR THE RECORD" that describes an unidentified target picked up on radar on November 11 over North Olmsted, Ohio. The document provides details about the target's location, speed, and movement, as well as the lack of any corroborating visual sightings or photographic evidence. It also mentions that the witness, Mr. Dort of the FAA, believed the target to be a balloon based on the wind direction. The document does not identify or name any individuals.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD

Based on telecon with Mr. Dort of FAA, North Olmsted, Ohio

Mr. Dort said that they had picked up an unidentified target on November 11 on their radar. The object was a definite primary target and was in a place where they didn't ordinarily pick up targets. 

Initially the target was at an azimuth of 070 degrees, was traveling about 50 mph and was approximately 20 to 25 miles north of Erie.
Although they have no height finder, Mr. Dort felt that the target would have had to have been quite high. Olmsted lost the object about 8 miles NW of Buffalo. Buffalo lost it at about 3 miles.

There are no scope photos, and no one actually saw the object.

It traveled in a straight line from initial position toward Buffalo.

Mr. Dort said he thought it must be a balloon. He stated that the wind was in the right direction but that he could not find anyone who had launched a balloon that should have been in the area at that time.

Dear Sirt

The following information is provided per your request regarding the unidentified target observed on the Cleveland Center Radar on November 11, 1967:

a. It was first observed at approximately 21:55 EST and observed for about 1 hour and 30 minutes.
b. Height was unknown, but estimated to be above 10,000 feet due to radar coverage in that area.
c. A very large primary target was received. It would equal or be better than a 30-40 mph aircraft.
d. ASR radar was being utilized.
e. As the object approached Buffalo Terminal Area, it was pointed out to Buffalo Tower at Buffalo, New York.
f. The target just vanished both from the Cleveland Center's and Buffalo Tower's radar. Where radar coverage is excellent. This was approximately 10 miles northwest of the Buffalo VOR.
g. No.
h. Action was taken to vector aircraft to the area for sighting. Due to observed weather and other traffic, aircraft would not come close enough to the area. No suspects were on top of the clouds at the time.

The text in the image caption states: "THE SKY OVER Eglin AFB was as bright as day for several minutes during the final night test mission of a new flare launcher being developed by the Air Force. The flares, used to mark and illuminate targets, were visible from a distance of over 500 miles. The test was conducted at the Eglin Air Force Proving Ground Center and developed by the Air Force Armament Laboratory, both of the Air Force Systems Command."

Dear Sir:

With regards to the subject, UFO Observations, 11 November 1967,
a 30-gram balloon with a lighting device was released at approximately 11:30 LST on Nov. 11. This type balloon reaches about 30" in diameter when first inflated with some increase in size at high levels, and travels with the wind at lower levels. Within an hour or so after
release, it would seem very unlikely that any balloon released at Fort Wayne would remain aloft long enough to be observed between Cleveland and Buffalo. 

We know of no other agency launching balloons in this area.

Very truly yours,

Clyde H. Downes
Meteorologist in Charge.

P. 3. The Weather Bureau at Toledo Express Airport, RAD, Station City 43554, tracks pilot balloon flights.

They claim they saw two long, thin rays of light shining down on an object which hovered over the trees behind their house from 11:00 to 11:30 on the night of November 6. They say they had a good view of the object through the trees, and it was a regular shape, however they could not make out any details. They also state they heard a faint humming noise coming from the direction of the object which seemed to be a steady tone, not intermittent. The object then ascended rapidly and disappeared from view."

Page 7 Page 8

En route to pick up a friend, I noticed several odd shaped objects in the sky... some weaving around in an erratic pattern appearing and disappearing. Others were hovering, motionless in the sky. I pulled the car over and watched them for about 15 minutes. There were around 4-5 main objects that were visible at any one time, although others would appear and disappear. The objects seemed to be reflecting sunlight in a rather odd manner, and would occasionally emit a sudden burst of speed and then resume their hovering or erratic pattern of flight. I found the objects to be rather awe-inspiring and have thought about this incident many times since then. I am unable to offer any explanation as to what these objects were, but they were definitely not any type of conventional aircraft that I am familiar with.

1. Reference your OSI Communication, iq DdlD-185/70/508.
2. January 1968, subject "Alleged UFO Sighting in Texas, FRG."

- We are unable to positively identify the objects in the photographs that you forwarded to us. However, the majority of the photographs are of general lighting shows which we assume to be a natural phenomenon. The planet Venus, which was at an approximate elevation of 9.5 and an azimuth of 049.5 on September 6, 1967, and a celestial magnitude of -4.1 on November 6, 1967, and was by far the brightest astronomical body in the sky. However, without knowledge of the elevation and azimuth of the objects that Sgt Clark sighted, we are unable to positively identify the objects.

3. Several other photographs appear to be multiple exposures of an unknown light source.

4. Since the observations took place outside the limits of the United States, no further investigation will be made. Sgt Clark's photographs are attached.

FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S REPORT
NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA
CASE NO. 30
LOCATION: NORTHOLMSTED, OHIO
DATE: NOVEMBER 6, 1967
INVESTIGATOR: WILLIAM SPAULDING
SUMMARY OF INCIDENT: On the evening of November 6, 1967, at approximately 7:30 p.m., a resident of North Olmsted, Ohio, observed a strange light formation in the sky over his home. The witness, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that he was standing in his backyard when he noticed a cluster of lights in the sky, slightly to the east-southeast and at an estimated altitude of 5,000 feet. The lights, which he described as pale orange or yellowish in color, appeared to be moving in a northwesterly direction.
The witness observed the lights for approximately 10 minutes before they gradually disappeared from view. He reported the incident to the local police department, and an investigator from NICAP was subsequently dispatched to the scene to gather further information and evidence.
INVESTIGATOR'S FINDINGS: The investigator, William Spaulding, interviewed the witness and took several photographs of the area where the incident was reported to have occurred. The photographs, however, did not reveal any significant details or anomalies. The witness was unable to provide any additional physical evidence to support his account.
CONCLUSION: Based on the limited information and lack of physical evidence, the investigator was unable to determine the nature or origin of the light formation observed by the witness. The case has been classified as "unresolved" pending further investigation or the availability of additional information.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typewritten document from the U.S. Air Force regarding a UFO sighting. The text describes the sighting that occurred in Northern Ontario, where several witnesses observed various lights in the sky that were larger and brighter than the usual aircraft. The document provides a detailed narrative of the sighting, including the movements and characteristics of the observed lights.

Following is the full text extracted from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 19 Nov 1962
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
On the night of November 4, 1962, four men were hunting in the Perry Sound District of Northern Ontario. The district is North Bay Ontario. The hunters were a retired RCMP Constable and three friends. At approximately 7:30 pm they spotted a flight of five brightly lighted objects. These objects appeared higher than the normal aircraft flying in the area. The objects were travelling in a northeast direction. As the objects approached their position, the men noticed that the lights were much larger and brighter than the usual aircraft. The lights were described as being the size of a large car and each light was much brighter than the headlights of a car. The objects appeared to be disc shaped and the lighting spanned the full underside of the objects. As the objects passed overhead, the men noticed a very faint humming sound which appeared to be coming from the objects. The objects were in sight for approximately 2-3 minutes and then disappeared to the northeast. The men were all adamant that these were not any type of known aircraft. They have had extensive experience in observing aircraft, both civilian and military, and state positively that these objects were unlike anything they have ever seen before. The observations were made under ideal conditions, the sky was clear and the moon was full. The men had an unobstructed view of the objects. The sighting was reported to the R.C.M.P. detachment at North Bay, Ontario. Publications re. 16-115 necessary.

SUBJECT:    Investigation of UFO Sighting 9 November 1967

1. On the night of 9 November 1967 between the hours of 1250 - 1302Z several reports of a UFO sighting were received at the 7/13 Air Base Defense Command Center at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. These reports were received from various military installations in Thailand. Over 150 persons observed the phenomenon while attending a motion picture showing at the outdoor theater at Udorn RTAFB.

2. On 10 November 1957 I was appointed investigating officer for this incident. My investigation included interviews with officers and airmen stationed at Udorn RTAFB although telephone coordination of the sighting was made with USAF officers and airmen at several other installations in Thailand. The investigation revealed observations closely parallel each other especially as to attitude, attitude and direction of flight of the UFO. The most complete report was submitted by Lt.Col John H. Scholtz of the 11th TASS who observed the phenomenon from the outdoor theater. Attachment 1 is a copy of Colonel Scholtz's report. Attachment 2 is a copy of the local weather report for the period just prior to the sighting as prepared by Detachment 3 Udorn RTAFB. Attachment 3 is a copy of a newspaper article as reported in The Bangkok World on 11 November 1967.

3. Many of the persons whom I interviewed had previously observed meteors, satellites, aircraft, and other celestial phenomena. All reporters stated that the speed of the UFO was not as fast as any shooting star they had seen and the trajectory of the UFO across the horizon was much flatter than that of meteorites which had been observed. Additionally most reporters indicated that the path of meteorite showers was generally at a higher elevation above the horizon than the UFO. One reporter noted that the distance between fiery objects in a meteorite shower were greater than those noted on the night of 9 November.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report documenting a UFO sighting. The text describes the incident, stating that the UFO was not as high as the Echo Satellites and that no sounds were heard. The report concludes that there is insufficient evidence or corroborating data available locally through open source material to positively identify the source of the UFO, and that the incident was possibly related to the launching of a Saturn 5 rocket from Cape Kennedy, Florida in November 1967.

Text output:

Another observer pointed out that the are of the UFO was not as 
high as the Echo Satellites he had observed. No sounds were 
heard relative to the UFO by any observers and none could give
any indication as to size, shape, color or brightness. Other 
other stations as reported to 7/13 AF TACC were visual. No 
radar sightings were reported.

4. Conclusion: Insufficient evidence or corroborating data
are available locally through open source material to positively 
identify the source of the UFO. No details as to the direction, altitude,
orbital path, or times and locations of stage separations were
listed in the local press. However, it is possible that the UFO 
incident as observed and reported in Thailand resulted from
a launch of the Saturn 5 rocket.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The document provides a detailed description of a UFO sighting, including the shape, size, color, number, and formation of the observed objects. It also describes the observer's location and circumstances of the sighting. The text in the document is as follows:

Reference para 11 AFR 80-17, UFO Report

1. UFO Report
a. Description of object
(1) Shape - undeterminable because of distance between observer and object, possibly cylindrical shape.
(2) Size - the lead object of the swarm was about the size of Venus in the night sky.
(3) Color - the lead object was blue white with a light intensity compared to Venus. The remaining objects were the same color and the light intensities emitted were steady but of diminishing brilliance down to about the equivalent of the star Polaris.
(4) Number - there were approximately 12 objects in the swarm.
(5) Formation - the lead swarm had about ten objects in a random V-formation. The distance between objects was uniform. The dimensions of the formation was measured using a lead pencil held at arm's length and was enclosed within a rectangle measuring 7 degrees of arc in length by 3 1/2 degree of arc in width. The second formation with two objects was approximately 10 degrees of arc behind the lead object of the first formation measured about 1 1/2 degrees by 1 degree of arc in size.
(6) Features or details - no significant features or details were noted.
(7) Each object in each formation left a distinct trail which was a thin dull gold color. Each trail measured approximately 20 degrees of arc.
(8) Sound - no sound was associated with the sighting.
(9) No other pertinent or unusual features.
b. Description of course:
(1) Observer was seated at the Udorn RTAFB outdoor movie theater when he first observed what was believed to be

Text from the document:

aircraft on fire in the distant northern horizon.
(2) The objects were first observed at a 10 degree 
angle of elevation - azimuth 320 degrees.
(3) Objects disappeared from observers view at 10 
degrees elevation 150 degrees azimuth.
(4) The flight path of all objects was straight with no 
change of course. All objects travelling at same speed (no relative 
motion between objects). The best and closest point of observation 
was at 60 degrees elevation, azimuth 250 degrees.
(5) Objects disappeared as they passed over the horizon.
(6) The objects were visible for approximately 1 1/2 
minutes.
c. Manner of observation:
(1) Ground visual
(2) No optical aids
(3) N/A

Akron, Ohio 44309 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46801 Flint, Michigan

The attached additional informatlon is in response to an unidentified flytng object report from Olmsted (Cleveland) Air Traffic Control Center. 

They painted an object at approximately 2105 EST on 11 November 1967. This was approximately seventeen miles northwest of the west runway of Cleveland Hopkins Airport. The object traveled at an estimated speed of fifty mph. The object was painted by the Cleveland radar for approximately ten minutes and vanished.

Buffalo radar was also tracking the object and it disappeared from their sector approximately three miles from BUFFALO.

Is there any balloons launched from your station that might be responsible for this sighting? Do you know of any other agency launching balloons in your area?

Any assistance you can provide is appreciated.

Gentlemen:

On November 11, 1969, while on a visit to Mexico, I took some pictures of unidentified objects in the sky. They were being seen by others as well. The objects appeared to be in a fixed position and seemed to be watching us. They were a different size and shape and moved in a different manner than the small, hazy objects that one sees as a distant airplane, etc. 

Since there was considerable traffic with the crowds on the avenues, it was difficult to get a good look at the objects for any length of time. However, on Sunday night, around 7:30, the objects were visible again and I was able to take two pictures, which I am enclosing herewith for your consideration.

I note that each exposure shows on the negatives, as from the camera I used, two strange looking objects. However, I believe the pictures do not actually portray what I saw with the naked eye, as the strange objects appeared much larger and more distinct when viewed directly.

This variation, it should be noted, is not one of those cases where the objects were photographed through a haze or other atmospheric interference. The night was clear and the objects were seen directly in the sky.

I hope these pictures will be of interest to you and I shall be glad to furnish any additional information you may desire. Please let me know your findings and conclusions.

Yours truly,

There is no photograph present in the provided image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text on the page appears to be a letter or report discussing observations and concerns related to the study of UFOs.

Project Bluebook:
I must say in all candor that I did not personally see the object in the sky. Neither can I say that they weren't there, as the reports concerned with looking at the object through binoculars and other means indicate that there was something quite unusual about it. However, I have been greatly puzzled by the discussions and so-called evidences that they should be considered as real or as some threat. It seems to me if this is to be a reported U.F.O., it will be found on or near the pavement, or, as they say, "on the ground and that this is the object which is be be observed." In the original, save the traffic lights of the toll-like automobile.

Neither there were objects there or not, I cannot say. I must bring this directly to belong. Those who have actually seen U.F.Os, or honestly, else, I am entirely satisfied that there was some such object as the senior reported over.

The sintures you may keep and add them to what must be now file of reported U.F.Os. If you have any explanation for what be seen, or what this so-called evidence is, I would certainly be very to know it. I have been greatly puzzled, as have others, as to whether there must be some kind of residue as to these objects.

Yours truly,

NORTH OLMSTED, OHIO
OBSERVER REPORT 6 NOVEMBER 1967
REFERENCE NUMBER: 6975327

On 6 November 1967 at approximately 6:15 PM EST, a bright orange-yellow light was observed in the sky over North Olmsted, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. The light appeared to be in the southwest sky and was estimated to be at an altitude of 500-1000 feet above the ground. It was initially observed as a stationary light source but then began moving erratically, darting back and forth and up and down. The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view. No sound was heard associated with the object.

The witness, a 35-year-old male, reported the incident to the local police department. An officer was dispatched to the area but was unable to locate the object. No other witnesses could be found in the immediate vicinity.

This report was forwarded to Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for further investigation. No definitive explanation for the observed phenomenon could be determined.
