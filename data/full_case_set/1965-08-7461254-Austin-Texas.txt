The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or drawing. The sketch appears to depict a compass with angular measurements and instructions related to sighting and describing an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the horizon (sky line) where the object was above the horizon. (Try to estimate where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.

I SIGHTED THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES BEGINNING ABOUT 8 P.M. OVER SOUTHEAST AUSTIN. IT WAS A RECTANGULAR OR SQUARE-SHAPED OBJECT WITH A BRIGHT GLOW EMANATING FROM IT. IT HOVERED IN ONE POSITION FOR SEVERAL MINUTES THEN SLOWLY MOVED OFF IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. I HAVE OBSERVED OTHER OBJECTS IN THE SKY WHICH I CONSIDERED TO BE UNUSUAL, BUT THIS WAS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND CLOSE-UP SIGHTING I HAVE HAD.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? AUGUST 15, ARMED FORCES

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 27 June 64

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific parts of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting: First, I want to assure you that I am as anxious as you to solve this case, and I want to cooperate to the fullest extent possible. Let me summarize the information I have: 
On the night of 11 April 1964 my wife and I observed a bright light in the sky over the Springdale area. It was approximately 8:45 pm. The light seemed to be hovering, and at times would hover and then dart off at a very high rate of speed. It would then stop hover again, and then repeat the darting motion. The light was very bright, and at times seemed to be pulsating. It would seem to diminish in size and intensity and then flare up again. The light seemed to be at a high altitude, possibly several thousand feet up. We observed it for approximately 20-25 minutes before it simply disappeared from sight. I am a commercial pilot by profession, so I am quite familiar with aircraft lights, and this was definitely not an aircraft. I had never seen anything like it before, and I have not seen anything like it since. I can assure you that I am quite sane and rational, and this was a genuine unidentified flying object. I am very interested in your findings, and I would be happy to provide any additional information that might be helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

14-15 August 65 15/05/002
Austin, Texas
Astro (STAR/PLANET) ?
Sighting characteristic of a star or planet observation

BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Object drifted slowly in the sky for about 5 to 7 minutes, at approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. It was green in color, about the apparent size of a quarter held at arm's length. During sighting, some twinkling or flickering of the object is noted. There were no erratic motions or maneuvering characteristic of astronomical objects. The conclusion is that a satisfactory explanation has probably been obtained, and this sighting is identified as a star or planet observation.
