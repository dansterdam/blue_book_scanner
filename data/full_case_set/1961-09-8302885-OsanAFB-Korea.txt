The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a project record card from Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects. The card contains various fields describing an incident, including the date, location, type of observed object, length of observation, and conclusions.

PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 14 Sep 61
2. LOCATION: Osan AFB, Korea
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 141630Z Sep 61
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Viewed
5. DURATION OF OBSERVATION: 12 min
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 1
7. COURSE: Varied
8. ALTITUDE: Unknown
9. COMMENTS: Changes in color of light could be due to witnesses. (Color changes may indicate malfunction or malfunctions.) Winds direction, altitude of aircraft, etc. Ground noise, and passage of a sound source could be observed. Radars could not track the object.
10. BRIEF DETAILS OF SIGHTING: Object or fighting was local area. Changes in color of light could be due to witnesses observing different characteristics. Witness did not detect any sound which would indicate the object. There was no report which would indicate that the object was necessarily artificial or not.
11. CONCLUSIONS: Probably a balloon. Ground-Radar could not track the object suggesting it was not a real target. Probably Astro. No evidence of any conventional aircraft, meteor, or other known natural phenomena which would account for the sighting. Insufficient information to arrive at a positive conclusion as to the nature of the phenomenon observed.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a filled-out UFO analysis sheet from Project Blue Book, with various fields such as location, date, satellite, astronomical phenomena, radar analysis, natural phenomena, aircraft/balloons/airships, and an evaluation of source reliability.

OBJECTIVE OF THIS EXTRACT OF THIS SIGHTING IS TO ASCERTAIN IF THE OBJECT OBSERVED COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE KNOWN CONVENTIONAL AIR CRAFT/SATELLITES OR NATURAL PHENOMENA WHICH COULD HAVE PRODUCED THE REPORT AND RELATED PHENOMENA REPORTED BY THE OBSERVER.
ACCORDING TO THE SIGHTING REPORT, THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT HOURS. FURTHER INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THE OBJECT WAS INITIALLY OBSERVED AS A BRIGHT CIRCULAR OBJECT WHICH LATER BECAME SMALLER AND CHANGED SHAPE. THE OBJECT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE MADE RAPID CHANGES IN ALTITUDE AND SPEED.
OBJECT IN THE NIGHT WAS OBSERVED TO EMIT BEAMS OF LIGHT. OTHER REPORTED PHENOMENA INCLUDED RADIO INTERFERENCE AND MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES.
BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THIS SIGHTING CAN BE READILY EXPLAINED AS A CONVENTIONAL AIR CRAFT, SATELLITE OR NATURAL PHENOMENA. THE REPORTED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT AND THE ASSOCIATED PHENOMENA DO NOT MATCH ANY KNOWN CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATIONS. FURTHER INVESTIGATION MAY BE WARRANTED TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THIS SIGHTING.

THE HORIZON AND APPROXIMATELY 
15 DEGREES WEST OF NORTH. IT WAS 
OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5
MINUTES. THE OBJECT APPEARED 
TO BE SPHERICAL IN SHAPE AND 
EMITTED A BRIGHT LIGHT.

IT MOVED IN AN ERRATIC MANNER,
FIRST MOVING SLOWLY TO THE EAST-
NORTHEAST, THEN RAPIDLY TO THE
WEST, THEN BACK TO THE EAST-
NORTHEAST. IT THEN CLIMBED AT A
VERY STEEP ANGLE AND DISAPPEARED.

CAPTAIN STATED THAT HIS FIRST
IMPRESSION WAS THAT OBJECT WAS
A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT,  BUT
THAT ITS BEHAVIOR WAS VERY 
UNUSUAL.
