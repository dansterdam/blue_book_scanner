The image contains two photographs. Both depict a dark sky with a mysterious object that has a trail. The object appears to be moving, leaving a peculiar white, fluffy trail that resembles smoke or cloud. The streak of the trail is discontinuous and fragmented, indicating motion, and varying in brightness and density. There might be a small, more solid looking object at the front of the trail in both images. The photos are likely meant to capture what was believed to be an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Below each photograph, there is a caption which reads:
