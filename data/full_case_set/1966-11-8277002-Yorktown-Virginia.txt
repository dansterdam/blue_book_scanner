OCR Text Output:
c. Manner of Observation:
(1) Ground Visual
(2) No optical aids were used
d. Time and Date of Sightings:
(1) 0030 to 0105 hours, 23 November 1966; 1530 to 2200 hours,
22 November 1966
e. Location: Approximately 1 mile east of bridge across King Creek, on Colonial Parkway from Williamsburg, Virginia, to Yorktown, Virginia; 375 1/2 mile marker southbound lane.
f. Identifying Information on Observers:
(1) Observer 1: Mr. Virginia 23958, Associate Director, Virginia Institute of Marine Science, Gloucester Point, Virginia 23062; reliability questionable.
(2) Observer 2: Mr. Virginia 23962, Associate Information Officer, Virginia Institute of Marine Science, Gloucester Point, Virginia 23062; reliability questionable.
g. Weather and Winds:
(1) Observers stated weather conditions were clear, calm, cold and visibility unlimited.
(2) Weather conditions reported by Langley Air Force base flight weather facility:
(a) Clouds: Clear
(b) Visibility: 9 miles
(c) Temperature: 45째 F.

(c) Winds:
(C) 079/13 19.4 345/23
(D) 045/17 20.4 345/23
(E) 033/14 30.1 345/23
(F) 034/14 45.1 345/23

II. Meteorological Activity:
Radar activity in the area of the sighting was probably increased due to the changing weather conditions. The wind speed and direction as recorded by the Yorktown Naval Weapons Station was 17 knots from 050 (approx. 330 degrees) at the time of the sighting. A colliding front was moving in, causing considerable haze and poor visibility. Travel was difficult and more hazardous than normal.

III. Air Traffic:
High performance, single-engine jet traffic is very dense in the Langley Air Force Base/Oceana Naval Air Station areas. On a clear night the jet aircraft noises can often be mistaken for unexplained light phenomena.

This report was prepared by Captain Robert K. Germann, 4509 Air Base Wing (ADC) on 8 November 1966. Further details were gathered in a personal interview with airmen who apparently observed the object. The interview confirmed the report, particularly the statements regarding the jet aircraft noises which easily explain the sightings. It was also learned that what the witness may have seen a "shooting star" is also stated that he was surprised that the light (sic) were only visible for a short time, probably a meteor. It could also have been the tail-pipe exhaust or afterburner fire of a jet aircraft.

To Whom It May Concern:

As I saw an UFO last night and thought it should be reported, I have decided to send my observational notes to you. I am also sending copies of these notes to Dr. Edward U. Condon of the University of Colorado and to Dr. J. Allen Hynek of Northwestern University. The notes are as follows:

1. Observers #: a. Graduate Assistant, Parasitology Section, Virginia Institute of Marine Science, Gloucester Point, Virginia 23062.
b. Associate Information Officer, Virginia Institute of Marine Science

2. Time: Approximate time 7:50-8:00 PM EST, 22 November 1966.
3. Observation from: Approximately 3 miles NW of Yorktown on Colonial Parkway from Williamsburg, Va. towards Yorktown, Va.
4. Place of observation: Approximately 3 miles NW of Yorktown on Colonial Parkway (about 37째15'13"N Lat, 76째30'50"W Long.)
5. Direction of path of object: Appeared to be traveling directly south towards Yorktown, Va. (Could have continued eastward but was lost from view).
6. Object's position angle: 25-30째.
7. Duration of observation: 2-3 seconds, until trees along the parkway hid it from view.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch depicting two objects in the sky. The objects are described as oval in shape, circulating and extremely bright, with intense light trailing after them, and a visible "vapor" or apparent trail. The witness has provided a rough sketch of the observed objects and has asked if there is a natural explanation for this observation, stating they have not reported it to any newspaper and would prefer to have their name unpublicized.

Transcription of the text:

"a. Notes on Objects: Oval in shape, circulating. Object extremely bright, less intense light area trailing after object. Color blue-green to yellow-green. Object appeared to change color slightly as it circled. Apparent trail (vapor?) or otherwise after it had passed.
b. Rough sketch of objects: OBJECT # 777???77?

I would like to know if there is a natural explanation for this observation. I have not reported this to any newspaper and would prefer to have my name unpublicized.
Thank you.
Yours truly, [signature redacted]"
