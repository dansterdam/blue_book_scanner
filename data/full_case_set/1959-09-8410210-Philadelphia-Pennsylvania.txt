BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Ten observers while driving northward on the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, near Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, observed a bright white light approaching the automobile, which appeared to be hovering or stationary at first, but then moved rapidly across the sky in a horizontal direction. The light was estimated to be about the size of a basketball at arm's length, and was estimated to be about 1000 feet above the ground. The observation was made by the driver and nine other passengers in the automobile.
11. COMMENTS: This report (Case 0-92) was in the possession of the Blue Book files due to a prior telephone report. No further investigation was considered necessary.
