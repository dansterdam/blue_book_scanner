SUMMARY
State your own personal evaluation of the report. What do you think the object was? Do you think something other than the sighting motivated the caller? Include your evaluation of the caller's reliability.

ACCORDING TO THE CALLER'S DESCRIPTION:
HE DID PHOTOGRAPH SOME TYPE OF OBJECT, RATHER THAN AN OPTICAL ILLUSION. I WOULD NOT HOWEVER, CONCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF UNCONVENTIONAL SHAPES OR MIDDLE COLORS. I DID NOT FORM ANY OPINION *OF SOME OTHER MOTIVATION FOR CALLING.
I DID NOT ONE APPARENT CONTRADICTION; HE SAID HE WAS JUST PHOTOGRAPHING A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET, YET HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOS SOUNDS TO ME LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE, IN FACT, BEEN SHOOTING AT THE OBJECTS.
I WOULD APPRECIATE HEARING WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS REPORT IS AND WHAT ACTION (IF ANY) IS TAKEN.

This page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document does not contain any photographs. The text describes a situation where a man inadvertently took a photograph of a UFO while taking pictures of a sunset. The report discusses the man's claim that the photographs are valuable and he does not want to send them to the Air Force, as he has received numerous money offers for them. The report also mentions that the Air Force cannot perform an analysis without the original negatives, and that the man is being told to provide the negatives for verification.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
27 Aug 63
Subj: Photographs, [redacted]
Lt Conaway from the Information Office at Suffolk County AFB called Col Quintanilla on 27 August 1963 at 1445 hours. Lt Conaway said he had a UFO report that seemed rather important. He said the problem was that a man inadvertently took a photograph of a UFO while taking pictures of the sunset. The man claims they are valuable photographs and will not send them into the Air Force because they are so valuable and he has had numerous money offers from magazines. He does not want somebody from the Air Force to come out and look at them though. Lt Conaway said they did not have anyone there who could go out and look at the photographs. Col Quintanilla informed Lt Conaway that the original negatives would have to be looked at by photogrammetry personnel. Therefore, if the gentlemen wishes to have the Air Force look at the photographs he will have to send the original negatives in and also provide the data required in AFR 80-17. Col Quintanilla told Conaway that this man is probably trying to get the Air Force to say that his photographs are authentic. Well all photographs are authentic, but the UFOs aren't. The man who took the photographs is Mr. [redacted] of a New York Advertising Agency and is a professional photographer. Col Quintanilla told Lt Conaway that if he speaks with Mr. [redacted] on the telephone to insure that his secretary is on the telephone to verify the conversation. Lt Conaway will inform the man that the Air Force cannot perform an analysis without the original negatives and that he will be happy to forward the original negatives to the proper personnel for analysis.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed memo for the record dated 23 August 1963 regarding some photographs taken by a Mr. ******, who was the President of the Metro-Market Advertising Agency. The memo discusses details about the photographs of unidentified flying objects that Lt. Colonel Quintanilla accidentally took, and the analysis and handling of the photographs by various individuals.

Here is the full text output from the document:

MEMO FOR THE RECORD 23 August 1963

Sub: Photographs taken by Mr. ********, President of the Metro-Market Advertising Agency called
Lt Colonel Quintanilla on 23 August 1963 regarding some photographs of
unidentified flying objects that he accidentally took. Mr. ******* informed
Col Quintanilla that he had spoken with Lt Conway at Suffolk County AFB
with regards to the photographs. Mr. ******* said that he and his other
professional members had never seen anything quite like this, they are
quite extraordinary. Mr. ******* said he had never been interested in UFOs.
He said he had some of his top people study the photographs and knew it
wasn't reflections, lens flares, inversions or birds. He said the objects
are reflecting off of the sun, they have structural shapes. He blew them up
to it in diameter with a projection screen. There is a good deal of details,
with indentations, they have domes. Mr. ******* said that since he thought
there was no one more familiar with photographs than the Air Force than the
Blue Book Office, he wanted to forward them to Wright-Patterson for analysis.
Col Quintanilla informed Mr. ******* that he would turn them over to his photo
analysis personnel. Mr. ******* said he was sending them to Suffolk, Lt Conway
and Lt Conway was going to send them to Wright-Patterson. Lt Conway had
asked him some questions over the telephone but they weren't very detailed.
At the time the photographs were taken they were crossing the Delaware River
Bridge to New York, with a night camera he was taking pictures at 1/500 a
second. Mr. ******* stated to be assured that he would not the the full results
of the analysis if he turned them over to the Air Force. Col Quintanilla
informed him that he would receive the full report. He said that the company
attorney thought he shouldn't send the original negatives into the Air Force
but with Col Quintanilla's assurance that the original transparencies would
be returned in the same condition that he forwarded them to the Air
Force.

There is no photograph present in this image. The text provided appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book containing a detailed account of an incident involving the observation of unidentified lights over a bridge. The text describes the witness's experience of taking photographs and observing the objects as they moved over the bridge.

The text of the document is as follows:

he said he would go ahead and forward them to Lt Conaway. Col Quintanilla told Mr.  he could mark the originals in any manner he wished so that he could readily identify them as being the originals, especially since the Air Force has been accused, in the past, of not having returned the originals to observers. Mr.  said he would not mark them since he had viewed them many times and was very familiar with the photographs. Mr.  tried to stress the fact that they were not cranks but were professional personnel, and are not looking for publicity. Col Quintanilla informed Mr.  that the analysis would take 6 to 8 weeks, may be longer, may be shorter. It all depended upon the fact that the photo analysis personnel must work on the Southeast Asia work first. Mr.  said this would be okay as long as they had complete access to the analysis that would be accomplished. Mr.  then said he wanted to briefly explain the photographs. We were traveling to Washington to take photographs of Resurrection City. In advertising we are always taking photographs and we have a whole roomful of pictures, thus the reason for the camera. Leaving New Jersey around 6 pm, the sun was getting into a beautiful sky and the sun was getting into it. I had the camera outside the car window and we were traveling approximately 65 mph. I was simply snapping away. My vision was quite limited since we were in a small sports car. I continued to take pictures while we crossed the bridge. It was not until after the photographs had been developed and we were sitting in the projection room that we say a series of very bright lights that were over the bridges. We just stopped and looked at them. There were two here and two there. I have a pilots license and have never seen anything like this before. Then then put the next photo on the screen. This shows the UFO objects passing over the bridge, and perhaps it is 25-300 ft above this bridge. These objects were disc shaped, with son distinctive markings. The next photo shows them leaving the bridge, going south, following the path of the river. I had decreased the lens.

- page 18 -

The image contains three photographs that appear to show the outside of a car and a bridge in the distance. The text describes these photographs, indicating that the first one shows the outside of the car/car's bridge, the second one shows the bridge, and the third photograph shows the area just left of the bridge. The text also provides a phone number and area code for the person who submitted this report.

opening, the objects are reflecting the light of the sun. There are three photographs. This is it more or less. There are three photographs, the first shows the outside of my car/the the bridge is about 1-1/3 miles in the distance; the next photograph we were on the bridge and the next photograph we have just about left the bridge.

Mr phone number is area code 212 and office phone is area code 212.
