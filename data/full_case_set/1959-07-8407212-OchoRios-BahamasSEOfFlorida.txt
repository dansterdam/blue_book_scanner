CODE:

The handwritten text on the form states:
"The formation of the object was reasonably measured in that at the first time it was seen near the horizon and then slowly moved toward the observer as it did turn east and then northwest. It moved very fast and disappeared after about 15 minutes. It was a very high speed object and made no sound that could be heard."

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of what appears to be a bird of prey, likely an eagle or falcon, with wings spread. The text below the image indicates that this is part of a Project Blue Book report, specifically a report from Ochi Rios, Bahamas, dated July 9, 1959.

The text in the document reads as follows:

Senior Officer,
U.P.O. Division,
EIDUCTION,
Washington D.C.
U.S.A.

Dear Sir,

I cannot readily explain by sensor refutting or controlled dim activities, which you will be interested in this report. At 01.27 on the evening of July 9th, my attention was drawn to the North Coast of Jamaica. I was amazed when I saw a strange craft, the nature of which I have considerable difficulty to describe. It was high flying object, bright in all quadrants as far as the eye could reach, and could not be located altitude precisely east of the North Star on a course slightly east of South at an elevation of approximately 5000 ft. At 1 wished the object is found to be a glider or shape of aurora when the bright light at the northern end implying that it appears indistinguishable through a light hazing phenomenon, no motion or trail attached and is in an accustomed manner and listened for the motors. Witness is mindful to be interrogated as to be the impression obtained, however as soon as recovered to obtain as accurate an impression as possible.
...maintained until 02.12 at which time inspection changes so to North East in which direction the object became too dim to discern by 01.15 % Daylight observation the object changed position approximately 45 degrees of horizontal angle while maintaining at almost the same elevation until 01.27 eventually was lohist in the south western horizon and disappeared in the above manner.

- page 14 -

The image shows a sketch or illustration of what appears to be a bird of prey, possibly an eagle, with its wings outstretched. There is also some text below the image, which appears to be a report or description of a "strange object seen moving in the sky" on July 10, 1959. The report mentions that the object was observed moving from West to South-Southeast and that the witness was unable to calculate its speed.

Transcribed text from the document:

July 10, 1959 -

I have not yet attempted to calculate the speeds required to explain this sighting but will be pleased to assist in any way if you are unable to explain singly through your office.

Trusting this information is of some interest,

Strange object seen moving
in the sky

A bright object was seen by Captain E. J. Collins moving from West to South-Southwest last night about 10:00 p.m. The object was 40 to 50 feet long, as near as could be judged, and was bright, looking like a searchlight. It appeared to be some distance away and was moving very fast. The object was observed for approximately 1 minute.

First Officer

The image contains a detailed written report about an observation of what appears to be a UFO or unidentified aerial phenomenon. There is no photograph included in this particular page. 

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

On July 9th, at approximately six minutes after eight in the evening, what appeared to be a falling star was observed. On looking directly at the lighted object, it continued to be a star, the tail by this time had disappeared. After watching for approximately one minute, the object began to descend at an estimated approximate speed of 110 to 120 miles per hour. The object was described as shaped like a cigar, about the same size as a star, with no apparent wings or other distinguishing features. The object came to a stop and hovered for a few seconds, as if strong lights had been turned on and appeared to be the outline and near center of the characteristic contained points. The object then moved almost due south, in a steady course approximately a full 180 degrees, at various times through this pattern, it appeared as larger and again as a smaller continuation of these stars. One central, brighter than the two smaller ones appeared only briefly and occasionally - as it came toward me it seemed to be reddish and flew away from me, it disappeared about north and away from us. As it descended it was silhouetted and was a triangular shape. During the whole time, there was no sound of any sort. This was seen by four others in our party and observed from the
