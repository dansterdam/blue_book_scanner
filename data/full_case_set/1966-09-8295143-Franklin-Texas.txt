TWO WITNESSES:
BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observers noted initially outlined objects that appeared very distant and that the objects appeared to be travelling at a very high rate of speed. The observers watched the objects for some time and noticed that the objects would fade in and out and appear in 3 different locations, sometimes simultaneously. The observers described the objects as shimmering and appearing to fluctuate in brightness. The description is consistent with the behavior of astronomical objects, likely stars or planets.

The report states that the observers, who were calling from San Antonio, Texas, saw the object while enroute from Ft. Knox, Kentucky.

The report concludes by stating that these people did not seem concerned with the sighting.

The report also mentions that there were large weather balloons located in this area, one of which was trailing a long cable, but that no reports have been received of this phenomena.
