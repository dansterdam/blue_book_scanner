Text from the document:

Second UFO
Sighted Here
in Two Weeks

According to Devers, the object
was circular in shape and was bright
orange in color.

When asked what he thought
of the sighting, Devers said he did
not know what it was. He said that 
he had never seen anything like it
before.

Mrs Devers, 31, had also spotted 
the object. According to her, the
object had glowed brightly for several
minutes, then faded from view.

"My husband is ill, and I had turned
in soon after midnight Saturday", she
said. "Shortly after midnight I was awakened
by a bright light in the room. I looked out
the window and saw the object hovering
over the house. After seeing that he was
awake, I awakened my husband."

Devers said that since the object
had been sighted he had telephoned 
the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to
see if they have any explanations.

According to Devers, the object
was hovering over the house just 
above the treetops for several minutes,
then seemed to descend slowly and 
finally disappear in the distance.

There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. This seems to be a textual document from Project Blue Book, specifically a memo for the record regarding a UFO sighting on August 7, 1963 in Canada, as reported by Dr. Hynek.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subj: UFO Sighting, 7 Aug 63, Canada, by Dr Hynek

Dr J Allen Hynek called the Aerial Phenomena Office on 7 Aug 63 at 1300 hrs, EDT, to inform them that he saw a funny thing. Saw a jet chasing something at 11pm due North, a very bright ball of light, brighter than Venus. 10 deg behind the unknown object was a jet. "We don't think we could hear any sound from the bright object but we did hear noise from the jet." Could see the wing tip lights from the jet but only one big light from the object. Plane probably from Kincheloe, so Dr Hynek thought. Dr Hynek said he saw the object for presumably two minutes, but it may have been three. Dr Hynek said he was going to call Kincheloe and ask for information and would appreciate our office doing so. Dr Hynek will call/tomorrow morning.

At 1400 hours got through to Lt Col Quintanilla who was TDY in Wash, D.C. We will not contact Kincheloe to obtain the data. Additional information to obtain from Dr Hynek is: Are or sky covered, Did it pass directly overhead? Did Dr Hynek get any photographs? He always carries a camera. What was Dr Hynek's estimation of the weather? Was it clear?

Dear Sir,

As approximately 2025 Q on 10 Aug 1968 I saw a phenomenon in the sky which I feel I should report to you. When I went out of my house at around 6 a.m. a bright-green band of light in the sky that I at first thought was the aurora borealis - I realize it is a northern horizon specially. It was from the horizon over Rio old Esterville to a great 60' above and over my house it question the US hoard Station Roosevelt Field PD. I then notice a bright yellow-white light, with an elliptical halo round it, slightly above the mountain and in the land of livesgreen light.

I called to my wife, as I thought maybe I was seeing my first flying saucer, and when I did so it disappeared. So it would not be of the subject, and last it.

- page 8 -

There is no photograph present in this page of the UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text found in the document is as follows:

"It may be the case of a spins originating stars moving in the band of light.
It was then I realized that it was probably a satellite and that the band of light was more than daily 'rightly' of the man which had set an house or so earlier.
When the white light reached directly overhead, it disappeared. There were no clouds. The band of light was from 20 - 30 degrees arc in joint to the moon distance behind and moved through the sky with the white light. The 'gel' disappearing also at the overhead point.
The color at about the same time that I observed as echo satellite pass years ago in the Pacific.
I have had the years flying experience, both in jet and props."

THE SAN JUAN STAR — Tuesday, August 13, 1968.
V.I. Gets $350,000 For Teacher's Housing
VIRGIN ISLANDS (AP)--Governor Ralph Paiewonsky has received a check for more than $350,000 as a loan from the Chase Manhattan Bank to provide teacher housing in the Virgin Islands.
The housing units are to be constructed on recently acquired land to work in the Virgin Islands public school system.
There is a shortage of moderate-priced apartments has often been cited by teachers as the reason why they hesitate to come to the Virgin Islands to teach.

NEW PARTY
(Continued From Page 13)
The Republican Party for a fourth party is received.
Other matters mentioned are Senator McGovern and Governor Rockefeller, but both are reluctant to lead the party.
If no recognized political figure agrees to lead the party, Raskin said, it would mobilize young people and minorities to step into the party leadership. The possibilities of forming a new political party are now being studied.
Raskin, a 34-year-old author who served on the staff of President Kennedy's Administration, said he had been surprised at the "widespread dissatisfaction" with the two major parties.

Gentlemen: 

On Aug 13, 1968 at 7:25 pm my brother (Tom) and I were driving east on Rt. 127 on our way home. We both observed an object that seemed to be hovering over a field. The object was glowing bright orange and was about 20 ft. in diameter. Our car flickered momentarily as we passed under the object. After a few minutes, we observed the object ascend at a high rate of speed and disappear. 

I would appreciate any information you can provide on this incident. Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,
Allen

1. Reference your undated letter reporting a sighting of a metallic shining object on 15 Aug 69. From the time and place you have described, this could have been one of the visible satellite tracks passing in the night sky. Many of the reports we receive are of illuminated satellite tracks rather than it must have been one of the visible retro-grade satellites. However, continue to report such manifestations to us at once, especially if you should see an exact identification would be extremely difficult.

2. The disturbing implication in your letter leads me to suspect you think this or other aerial phenomena you may have observed are possibly products of an unknown advanced technology. While this CANNOT be ruled out on the basis of the UPO observation alone, we are unable to further investigate your sightings. However, we will include your report for information purposes with our concerns.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES AUG. 12-18, 1968

The charts in this publication are a continuation of the charts previously issued as part of the Weather Bureau publication, Daily Weather Maps. They include the Surface Weather Map, the 500-Millibar Chart, the Tropopause Chart, and the Daily Precipitation Chart.

The Surface Weather Map presents station data and the isobars for 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The tracks of well-defined pressure systems are indicated by chains of arrows. The locations of these pressure systems are indicated for 6, 12, and 18 hours preceding map time by small black squares enclosing the hour figures.

Areas of precipitation are indicated by shading. The weather reports that are printed here are only a fraction of those that are included in the operational weather maps, and on which the analyses are based. Occasionally apparent inconsistencies between the density of shading and the reports received may result from those station reports that cannot be included in this publication because of lack of space.

The 500-Millibar Chart presents the height contours and isotherms of the 500-millibar surface at 7:00 a.m. e.s.t. The height contours are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled in degrees Celsius. The arrows show the wind direction and speed at the 500-millibar level.

The Highest and Lowest Temperatures Chart presents the maximum and minimum values for the 24-hour period ending at 1:00 a.m. e.s.t. The names of the reporting points can be obtained from the Surface Weather Map. The maximum temperature is plotted above the station location, and the minimum temperature is plotted below this point.

The Precipitation Areas and Amounts Chart indicates by means of shading the areas that had precipitation during the 24 hours ending at 1:00 a.m. Amounts in inches are given at the stations for the same period. Isopleths begin at a trace, and indicate a trace of precipitation. Dashed lines show the depth of snow on the ground at 7:00 a.m. of the previous day.

A. Capt. Walter 0. Kaupa
B. SID

1. On 9 Aug 68, this office received a telephone call from Mr. Albert Radel, Box 1053, Middletown, Ohio, who reported sighting an unidentified flying object.

2. Mr. Radel stated that on 9 Aug 68, at approximately 1900 hours, he and his wife were driving on State Route 63, approximately 5 miles west of Middletown, Ohio, when they observed what appeared to be a small light in the sky. As they continued driving, the light appeared to grow larger and brighter. Mr. Radel stopped his car, got out and observed the object more closely. He described the object as round in shape, approximately 20-30 feet in diameter, and surrounded by a very bright light. The object appeared to hover approximately 100-200 feet above the ground and was silent. Mr. Radel stated the object remained in the area for approximately 10 minutes, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. 

3. No other witnesses were located.

4. No physical evidence was obtained.

5. This report is being forwarded to your office for your information and appropriate action.

SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:

At approximately 2005 EDT on 9 August 1968, the observer, a police officer, observed a bright light in the southwestern sky. The object appeared to be stationary at first, then began to move in an arc-like pattern, changing directions abruptly. The object was observed for approximately 15-20 minutes before disappearing from view.

No physical evidence was recovered, and no other witnesses were reported. The officer's description of the object's movement and maneuverability is consistent with other reported UFO sightings. No explanation for the sighting was determined.
