FROM Jigmrn.fl): FllOht 1-A. 46024 AISS REPORT NO: 1A-UFCB-3-55 PAGE 3 OF 4 PAGES

SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATIVE EFFECTS:

1. The 635th AC&W Sq at McChord AFB was unable to furnish any information on the sighting.

2. There are no facilities available to Flight 1-A for checking on astronomical data.

A check with Sandpoint RAS at Seattle, Washington, the only agency in this area that launehes balloons, revealed that no such object from the sighting could have been a balloon released at 04/0231L Sept 1955 could not have been in the Bellingham area because prevailing winds were from the north and would have put the balloon far to the south of the sighting.
