north. All observers stated that objects appeared to be the southward pair or another of similar size and speed. The aircraft was observed traveling at a high rate of speed, in excess of 600 miles per hour. The size was estimated as 25 to 50 feet in diameter. This is the largest object observed thus far except that light was larger than usual for a star. Observers just said very fast.

STATEMENT

Upon completion of a tour of duty from 1950 to 2300, 27 February 1953, I was in the USAF control tower at Kelly AFB, San Antonio, Texas. Preparing to land an aircraft, I noticed to my attention what they considered to be a flying saucer. I looked up at it as it was moving over the field on a heading of approximately 290 degrees true, and it was rocking back and forth. This man that I was probably incorrect in my interpretation, as it was probably an astronomical object. 

The object made a slight dive and then pulled back up. Its speed appeared to be silght. Later as I watched it, it was rocking and making what appeared to be oscillating moves. Its motion seemed to slow down and then speed up. I wathced this object for about thirty minutes until it disappeared.

At this time the weather was clear, wind at 320 degrees, 9 knots, visibility unlimited. I notified the Base Operations and reported what I had observed. They asked me several questions and I decided to go to Base Operations and report what I had seen.

There was no one at Base Operations at that time. I then called flight service in Austin and made a report of the sighting and requested that they have a officer from the District Intelligence Office contact me. They said they would do so. No one from the District Intelligence Office ever contacted me. However, I was contacted later that day by a civilian from the Security Division. After interviewing me, he stated that they had received similar reports from other observers and that he was satisfied with my account. He stated that they did not wish to take any further action and that I need take no further action on this matter.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed statement describing an observation of an unidentified object in the sky on the night of February 27, 1953. The text describes the object as moving rapidly and then stopping, and then slowly moving back the way it came, with the most amazing thing being the steady, large light and its rapid movement.

STATEMENT

On the night of 27 February 1953 I saw an unidentified object in the sky. It seemed to be extremely high with a steady glow. At first it was about the size of a dime and I saw it for about two or three seconds. Then it seemed to shoot off to the left at a terrific speed and was out of sight in an instant. Then it seemed to shoot back and hang motionless for a couple of seconds and then seemed to shoot off again and was gone. This thing gave me the impression of being controlled, but the most amazing thing was the steady large light and the rapid movements.

STATEMENT

It was about 22:40 on the 27th of February 1953 when my way to work I noticed a circular bright light moving at a high rate of speed. At first I thought it was a star, but it did not move as stars are supposed to do, instead it moved and then stopped motionless for a few seconds. The light was very bright and circular in shape. As it circled the scene it would disappear for a few seconds. At short intervals it made a dive towards the ground but my car continued to move and I did not observe anything further. The night was too clear and I am not capable of estimating the distance. The light was very far away. The night was too clear and I am not capable of estimating the distance.

STATEMENT

The following took place on the night of 26 February 1953. As I came to work at about 20 minutes to mid-night 1, along with about twenty-four others, I was traveling light in the sky. In appearance it looked about like a star moving at excessive speed. The object was very clear against the night sky. As I watched it progress, it disappeared from sight. It must have covered the distance between here and San Antonio, which is about 80 miles, in a very short time. It was traveling so fast that the object appeared to be at an extreme height. It must have taken about eight minutes to travel the distance from here to the southwest of us. There is not much I know about it. It was not a saucer-like flight, but it seemed to be propelled by some mechanical power I would have taken for another star.

STATEMENT

On the 27 February 1953 I saw an unidentified object in the sky. The object seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed. It came from the southeast and was traveling in a general northeasterly direction. The object was very bright and seemed to be spinning as it traveled across the sky. That was the last that I saw of the object. There was no sound.

STATEMENT

On the night of 26 February 1953, upon leaving the communications center in San Antonio, Texas, I observed a light in the sky and traveling at a high rate of speed. This speed was maintained for a distance and then it appeared to slow down for a while, then it again picked up speed and disappeared. I could not even guess at the altitude. One factor that makes me believe that it was very high is the fact that I first saw the light at approximately 8:20 p.m. at an altitude of 80 degrees north, and watched it steadily west for over a minute. When I first saw the light it was moving very fast, and then it slowed down for a while, and was again in the west. I again observed it at 8:35 p.m. in the west and it was again moving very fast and then it disappeared. The light was bright and steady and compared to the stars, it was much brighter. It was not blinking or changing color.
