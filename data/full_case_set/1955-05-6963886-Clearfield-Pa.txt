The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be an index card from the Project Blue Book records, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The card provides details about a UFO sighting, including the date, location, type of observation, number of objects, course, and observations made.
