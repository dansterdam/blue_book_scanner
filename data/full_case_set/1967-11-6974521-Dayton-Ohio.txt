Transcription of the text:

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

The object was sighted at 9:58 P.M. on May 27. It was observed by 4 witnesses who stated that the object was moving steadily from east to west and moved in a zig-zag pattern about 30 to 35 degrees in the sky. The object disappeared after about 5 minutes.

The witnesses told that the object was much brighter than the stars and was about the size of a dime held at arm's length. They could not estimate the speed of the object but stated that it was fairly bright.

The reason why I changed my statement is because the object disappeared rather abruptly if the normal traveling pattern and this would suggest that the object may have taken flight at a high rate of speed which I feel I could not positively make an estimate on.

The image contains a compass-like illustration on the top half and two sketches on the bottom half. The compass illustration appears to show different directions labeled with compass points. The two sketches depict a person standing on a road or path, with variations in the surrounding landscape.

6A. HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN X' AT THE POSITION ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH YOU ARE FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "S"ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON FIRST APPEARED.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "S" AT THE POSITION FROM WHICH THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST OBSERVED. CONNECT THE "X" AND "S" WITH A LINE, SUCH A LINE WILL INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "X" AND "S".

When it was seen first it appeared oval shaped and white, bright light coming from the underneath. As it came closer, it appeared more like a saucer shape, with a dark center and the bright light around the edge of the underside. It was moving silently across the sky at an estimated speed of 600 to 800 mph, straight and level. It was observed for approximately 30 seconds. The night was clear with stars visible.

THERE WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY THAT WAS LIKE A FLAME. IT SEEMED TO BE HOVERING AND THEN IT MOVED TOWARD THE NORTHWEST VERY RAPIDLY. IT WAS LARGER THAN A STAR AND BRIGHTER THAN A PLANE. IT MOVED WITHOUT ANY SOUND AND LEFT NO TRAIL. THE LIGHT WAS A BRIGHT WHITE WITH A PINKISH TINT. IT WAS ABOVE THE TREES AND APPEARED TO BE SEVERAL MILES AWAY. ITS MOVEMENT WAS VERY RAPID AND IT DISAPPEARED INTO THE DISTANCE.

The page contains a questionnaire-style form with various questions about the observed UFO phenomenon, including whether the object moved in a straight line, changed color, made a noise, etc. The witness has provided handwritten responses to these questions. There is also an open-ended question at the bottom asking the witness to describe what drew their attention to the phenomenon.

The image contains two illustrations. The larger illustration depicts a compass rose with directions labeled around the circumference. The instructions above the compass rose indicate that the observer should place an "X" on the compass to indicate the direction of the phenomenon when first seen.

The smaller illustrations on the bottom show two different landscape views, with a figure standing in the foreground of each view.

OCR Output:
HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "+" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

In the sketch below, place an "A" at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a "+" at the position of the phenomenon when last seen. That is, schematically show whether the movement of the phenomenon appeared to be straight, curved or zig-zag. Refer to smaller sketches as an example of how to complete the indicating sketch.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observed sighted a star-like object that was moving from east to west. Capt. Forn 117 from the observer indicated that he saw the object at 1610 hrs. On 26 Nov 67, however, on a previous occasion at the same time, the observer had noticed a distant light which appeared to be nearly stationary. The observer indicates that both forms are on the same sightings. The time difference is stated as 15 min. The observer describes the object as being star-like, and that it is believed to be an aircraft in the Dayton area.
