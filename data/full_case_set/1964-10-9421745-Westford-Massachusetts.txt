REEORT 2-3
UFO REPORT 23 OCT 64
WITNESSES:
Mrs. Carney and her daughter Barbara, age 23.

SIGHTING:
Mrs. Carney and her daughter Barbara were in the family car on Old Lowell Road in Westford, Massachusetts on Tuesday, October 13, 1964, when they saw an object approximately 2-3000 feet high. They got out of the car and observed the object for about 45 minutes. They saw four lights, white, orange, and blue-green in color, which appeared to be on the side of the object. The object moved slowly at a constant speed and then accelerated rapidly up and out of sight.

EVALUATION:
Mrs. Carney and her neighbors have had a little share of UFO sightings before. They have reported 1-2 sightings within the past year.

CONCLUSIONS:
The observer's credibility in this case appears to be good. The object described does not conform to any known aircraft and cannot be explained as a result of natural phenomena. This case remains unexplained.

Text transcription:

On September 6, 1964, the observer, a private citizen, reported a novel aerial object, apparently luminous in nature, which was observed at about 11:15 PM, EDT, about 2 miles SW of Westford, Massachusetts.

The observer stated that the object was the size of a small automobile, and appeared to be luminous or illuminated. It made no sound, and moved at a speed estimated to be about 300-400 mph, traveling from west to east. The observer watched the object for about 10-15 seconds before it disappeared.

In view of the presence of radiation and because of the consistency of the description given, this case is considered to be a probable Unidentified Flying Object. No further investigation appears warranted.
