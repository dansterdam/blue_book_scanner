AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

       2. DETAILS: The control tower operator stated that he observed a bright light moving rapidly across the sky from north to south. The object appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet and travelling at a speed estimated to be 800 to 1,000 miles per hour. The object was observed for a period of approximately 2 minutes before it disappeared from view. No sound was heard and no trail was visible.

The speed and altitude of the object are consistent with other reported sightings of unidentified flying objects.
