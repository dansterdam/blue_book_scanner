10. CONCLUSION
A/P checks into the case indicate that the object here reported is a reflection of the moon or stars in the clouds, the clouds appearing to move such as to cause the apparent motion of the object. No evidence of anything out of the ordinary.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Lighted object in sky appeared to be moving, according to observers. Careful investigation determined that the object was simply a reflection of stars or moon in moving clouds, giving an impression of motion.

3. On 8 May 1953 the writer, in the opinion of S/A PAUL and Constable CORNIAN, interviewed STEWART, who stated that on 17 April 1953 at approximately 9:30 hours he observed a light in the sky.

4. On 8 May 1953 the writer, in the opinion of S/A PAUL and Constable CORNIAN, interviewed STEWART, who stated that on 17 April 1953 at approximately 9:30 hours he observed a light in the sky which he first thought was a helicopter, but it was 75 yards away from him and appeared to be a dome-shaped object and was hovering motionless. The object gave off a glow and was spinning rapidly. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes and then shot away at a terrific speed. STEWART stated that the object was approximately 20 feet in diameter and oval in shape. After the object disappeared, STEWART observed a small white light in the sky which appeared to be an aircraft, but was moving in a different direction and speed than the previously observed object.

5. On 6 July 1953 the writer, in the opinion of S/A PAUL and Constable CORNIAN, interviewed STEWART, who furnished the following additional information: In the meantime, STEWART had contacted others who had observed the object on 17 April 1953 and on looking into the air at the time he had observed the object, he now observed a large silver disc-shaped object hovering over the trees, which moved off at a terrific speed. This object was estimated to be around 60 to 70 feet in diameter and just as it passed over the trees, it gave off a glow and then shot up and away at such a terrific speed that it was lost from sight in approximately 2 to 3 seconds. STEWART stated that the small white light which he had observed after the first object had disappeared was possibly an aircraft, but the large silver disc-shaped object which he now observed was definitely not an aircraft, nor was it any type of known aircraft.

6. On 6 May 1953 an ordinary Mrs. [REDACTED] of Sheaves Cove Newfoundland wrote to the Commanding General, Air Defense Command, at USCJC, Queens, N.Y., stating:
"On 6 May 1953, at approximately 8:30 P.M., my daughter and I observed what appeared to be an object in the sky. It was hovering at a height of approximately 1000 to 1500 feet and appeared to be oscillating, or swaying, from side to side. The object was yellowish in color and appeared to give off a halo of light. It remained in the same position for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before accelerating and disappearing [REDACTED].
On 11 May 1953 the writer was interviewed in the presence of Major Richard L. Johnson, Intelligence Officer, who obtained the following additional information:
The writer stated that the object was observed on 6 May 1953 in the presence of her daughter, [REDACTED], and that the sighting lasted for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The object appeared to be about the size of a basketball and was yellowish-white in color, giving off a halo of light. It was hovering approximately 1000 to 1500 feet above the writer and her daughter and was oscillating or swaying from side to side. The object accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight.
This matter was referred to the US Air Force Headquarters, who determined that the object observed was not a satellite, rocket, or aircraft.

2. On 8 May 1953 the writer and *** observed a shining metallic object moving through the sky at a high rate of speed at Sheaves Cove, Newfoundland at about 1630 hours. The object was traveling in a straight line and at a constant altitude for approximately 10 to 15 seconds before disappearing over the horizon. It was silvery or metallic in appearance and gave the impression of being saucer-shaped.

1. On 6 May 1953 the writer, in the oouxea of an interview with a Constable Coulombe of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, was informed of the following details:

On the night of 17 March 1950 at approxtmately 2130 hours, Constable Coulombe was patrolling in the vicinity of Sheaves Cove, Newfoundland when he observed a bright light in the sky. This light appeared to be about the size of a man's head at arm's length and seemed to be descending slowly towards the ground. As Constable Coulombe continued to observe the object, he saw it stop abruptly at a point about 75 yards away from him and it then appeared to rise straight up again and disappear from sight at a very high rate of speed.

2. Constable Coulombe stated that the object which he observed emitted a bright reddish glow and was approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. He felt certain that it was not an aircraft or any known type of aerial vehicle. He stated that it made no noise whatsoever and that the ascent and descent were absolutely vertical. He felt it was definitely not a star, satellite, or any other known celestial body.

3. On 6 May 1953 the writer was only able to interview Constable Coulombe briefly, as the latter was about to go off duty. However, the writer did obtain the foregoing details and felt that the observation was of sufficient interest to warrant a further and more detailed interview at a later date. This was not accomplished, however, as Constable Coulombe was subsequently transferred to another district and the writer was unable to locate him.

Memo for the File
6. On 5 July 1953 the *****... in*****... Constable... an interview with an indiv****. The indiv***** stated that he had observed approx****** 20 bright o****. which ***** floats and hovered over the area of Sheaves Cove, Newfoundland, Can****, for about 1.5 hours on the evening of 5 July 1953. The objects were described as round in shape, varying in size from 10 to 20 feet in diameter, and emitting a bright, whitish light. The objects would suddenly disappear and then reappear at another spot. Considerable credence is given to this report in view of the good character and reliability of the witness, who stated that he had never before reported anything unusual.
7. On 11 Mar 1953 the ********* in the ****** of St. Ann's, Ne****** to the east of Sheaves Cove, reported seeing three luminous objects, similar to those described in paragraph 6 above, hovering in the night sky for about 10 minutes shortly after 8 pm on 20 April 1953 and that he had notified the Royal Canadian Air Force of the incident.
8. Capt. ******, Dept. ****, and several other indiv***** in the area confirm the fact that many unusual and inexplainable aerial phenomena have been observed in the vicinity of Sheaves Cove on numerous occasions over a period of several years.
9. Sheaves Cove, Nfld., is a small, isolated cove on the north coast of Nfld. approximately 50 air miles northeast of St. John's. It is an extremely remote and isolated area with little or no population, and is about 5 miles from the nearest village.
10. Sheaves Cove, Nfld., is in an inaccessible area and little is known concerning the geology, vegetation, flora and fauna of the region. However, it is suspected that the area may contain one or more small meteorite craters, deposits or iron rich rocks and minerals, and/or a strong magnetic field which may account for the unusual aerial phenomena observed in the area.
