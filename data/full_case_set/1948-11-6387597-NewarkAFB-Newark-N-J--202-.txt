Incident #202 -- Newark AAF Base, New Jersey -- 3 November 1948

In everything but the luminosity, the object reported 
bore answers to the description of a slow-moving fireball. Since
it was in sight "one second or less," the first quarter moon was
probably, the lights of the city and the airport, providing back-
ground and foreground illumination, may have tended to diminish the
brilliance of the object. This time of day was most propitious for a 
slow-moving meteor. Unless a more likely explanation is forthcoming,
this incident may be tentatively ascribed to the flight of a fire-
ball.

STATEMENT 

At 1850 hours, 3 November, 1948, I was standing just outside hangar 
#7 at Newark Air Force Base, on the south side of the hangar. 'T was a per-
fectly clear night. I looked up toward the moon and noticed a pale luminous 
object race across the sky. It was about 1/3 the brightness of the moon, 
round like a disk, with little or no depth(thickness) to it. It appeared to 
be about the same relative dime to us the moon. I viewed the object north-
northwest, in an arc, towards the south-southeast in about two and one halts 
passing out of sight over another hangar. I heard no sound from the object. 
I estimate the speed of the object at 600 miles per hour, and its altitude at 
five to six thousand feet. I have seen jet aircraft make tactical approaches 
at this field at approximately 600 miles per hour, and judging from them, the 
speed of the object I sighted was at least 200 miles an hour faster. From 
where I stood, I would approximate my angle of the path of the object, The 
peak of its are was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon to the west-
southwest of my position.

UNCLASSIFIED
At 1850 hours, 8 Nov 48, █████ was standing just outside Hanger
#7, Newark AF Base, when glancing up toward the moon he perceived a pale
luminous object race across the sky. It was about 1/3 the brigh[t]ness of
the moon, round like a disc with little or no depth (thickness). It
appeared to be about the same relative diameter as the moon and was traveling
from the north northwest in an arc toward the south southeast. Ob[i]ject was
seen about one second or less. It passed out of sight over another hanger.
No sound was heard. Speed was estimated at 600 MPH. Observer states that he
had observed jet aircraft make tactical approaches at approximately 600
mph and judged the speed of the object was at least 2000 mph faster. From
where he stood █████ could see approximately 75% of the path of the object.
The peak of its arc was approximately 45° above the horizon to the west
southwest of his position. Altitude was judged to be 5,000 to 6,000 feet.

Mr. █████ is a very reliable employee, highly intelligent and of excellent
character.

There were no reports of commercial, private and military craft flying in the
vicinity at the time.

No reports were received relative to possible release of testing devices in
the vicinity.

9 November 1948

At 1850 hours, 8 November 1948, I was standing just outside hangar 
#7 at Newark Air Force Base, on the south side of the hangar. It was a
perfectly clear night. I looked up toward the moon and noticed a pale
luminous object race across the sky. It was about 1/3 the brightness of
the moon, round like a disc, with little or no depth (thickness) to it.
It appeared to be about the same relative diameter as the moon. It
traveled from the north northwest in an arc toward the south southeast.
In about one second or less, passing out of sight over another hangar.
I heard no sound from the object. I estimate the speed of the object at
800 miles per hour, and its altitude at five to six thousand feet. I
have seen jet aircraft make tactical approaches at this field at approx-
imately 600 miles per hour, and judging from them, the speed of the
object I sighted was at least 200 miles an hour faster. From where I
stood, I could see approximately 75% of the path of the object. The
peak of its arc was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon to the
west southwest of my position.

                                                       Civilian Dispatcher
