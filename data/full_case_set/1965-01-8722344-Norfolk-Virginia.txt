This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text in the document describes details related to a reported UFO sighting, including information about the sighting, such as visibility, temperature readings, and other observed phenomena. The text also mentions the location as Norfolk, Virginia and the date as 1965-01-08.

Ceiling: Clear.
Visibility: Unlimited.
Cloud Cover: None.
Thunderstorms: None.
Vertical Temperature Gradient: An inversion was reported between 1000 feet and 1850 feet. The following temperatures were recorded:
900 feet: +2.1°C
1650 feet: +0.5°C 
3330 feet: +4.6°C
5000 feet: +0.3°C
7500 feet: -3.4°C
10000 feet: -5.0°C
These temperatures were taken by the Norfolk Weather Bureau at 1200 GMT.
A check was made by the Oceana Naval Air Station Public Information Office and the Oceana Naval Air Station, but no unusual activity was reported. This was likely only a meteorological condition which might account for the sighting. No interception action was taken due to a one-day flying condition.
The FAA Norfolk Approach Control reported that there was no air traffic in the area between 0600 and 1000 GMT on 8 January 1965.
This report was prepared by First Lieutenant Robert R. Dawkins, USAF, Intelligence Officer, Oceana Naval Air Station.
