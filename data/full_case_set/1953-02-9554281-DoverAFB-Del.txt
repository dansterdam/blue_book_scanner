11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
"This object changing colors hovered at 30-40 thousand ft. over the AFB. Object appeared to be metallic in color and maneuverable. Two attempts made unsuccessful attempts to close for closer observation. Object could not be identified as any known aircraft or astronomical phenomenon. The plant "Jupiter" in the NW horizon position at the time could not account for the observed phenomenon. No records of the USAF or of the US Navy Jets being in the area at the time. The identity of this object remains unknown. Further analysis and investigation appears indicated to determine the nature of this unidentified aerial phenomenon."

1 - Intelligence report on an observed object near Dover, Del. 22 February 1953. 

As reported, approximately 2200 hours 22 February 1953, 2nd Lt Leland E. Hines Jr., a radar observer, civilian, of New Castle, Delaware, who was training at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, saw a strange object in the sky. He was looking at his radar scope when the object appeared, making motions which indicated that it was controllable, and seemed to be under the pilot's guidance. The object was rounded, aluminum-colored, and from his position he estimated it as 30 feet in diameter. It had a white light burning not too fast, but steady, under the "hallow glow" from the object's position. The object was moving at a tremendous speed on a southerly course for a distance of approximately 400 to 500 yards, when it made a slight turn westerly, proceeding in a southwesterly course, until it disappeared from view. He immediately thereafter observed the object in the same area, proceeding in a northeasterly course, and he estimated it as being about 5 miles distant from his position. After several such maneuvers, during which the object seemed to be under control and to change directions, it accelerated and disappeared from view. The entire period of observation was over a half-hour, beginning at 2:30 hours.

2 - No additional details or information pertaining to the location of the object or the technician's identity could be obtained. The only information available is that the technician, Airman Basic Leonard J. Whitney, Jr., was the only person to view the object and report its observation, and that the object was not visible to any other personnel in the area at the time, except for a brief period when it was sighted by a civilian residing on a nearby farm. It was presumably the "evening star" which appeared to revolve, due to whichever meteorological conditions may have been present a the time. The period of observation was over a half-hour.

3 - No other reported sightings of the object could be located after an extensive search through available records. The technician's story remains the only record of the incident.

5 - Existing weather at time of observation was clear sky, no moon, no clouds. Visibility was good. Wind from WSW at 30 mph, Temp 20° F at 0100 hours, forecast 22°F at 2100 hours, 20,000 feet NE at 210 knots.

6 - All witnesses appeared as sincere and creditable persons and it is believed that their statements which have been included are substantially correct. The object was reported as similar in appearance to others which have been observed on other occasions rather than an intended hoax or deception for purposes of publicity or otherwise.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The document appears to be part of a UFO report from Project Blue Book, dated February 9, 1953. The text describes an incident where a pilot spotted a mysterious object near Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, but was unable to close in on it. The document is signed by Lt. Col. Edward E. Winesett, Jr.

Text from the document:

Regarding call, "Red Mesa Castle", apparent no instrument contact only what he had been able to see visually. He stated that the pilot had seen the object, but had been unable to close with it, and was eventually lost it.

The further information was forthcoming until the next morning, when a full report was obtained from the Intelligence Officer of the 75th at the Castle. The information in his report is contained in other sections of this report.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document, which I will now transcribe:

"Sitting with 2d the Tower and elanning my directing the T-33 personnel were also told to observe the object. However, they informed me that the object had been there "all evening".

My next efforts were directed to obtaining an aircraft for a close look. The 487th Tac Ops Sq at Dover was the nearest unit was being used by the 487th at Niks Castle AFB. I contacted the "astronomer" at Niks Castle and supplied the necessary information. I was informed that two (2) aircraft were in the area and that they would be contacted immediately.

I then went to the tower and just the glass on the object. The object now was approximately 1/2 to 1 degree in size. The object appears to be red in color when observed through the glasses. It was diminishing in size, giving the impression of ...ent away from my viewpoint. 

While in the tower a Niks Castle jet called us and asked for our location of this object. The tower estimated the object to be due west of the field and seven miles. The pilot of the aircraft stated that it was further away than seven miles in about so he could not effectively investigate it from the air. It was heard at Dover too.

I continued to observe the object of night. It appeared to experience a slight change in brightness approximately every 15 minutes. I then left the tower.

To Dover AFB from Blue Book
The report for statement from the main witness for my investigation on the night of Feb 
28, 1953:
My wife and I first noticed what appeared to be a circular light in the western sky at about 9:10 p.m. as we were driving south on Route 9. At first it appeared to be a star, but as we watched, this object began to zigzag back and forth, moving up and down, and at times appearing to stand still. In a matter of a few minutes, this object seemed to become bigger and brighter, and I would estimate it was at about 2,000 feet altitude and about 2 miles from our position.
The object seemed to be following a course roughly parallel to the ground, going from west to east. At one point it appeared to come to a complete stop and then seem to split into two or three separate objects, which then immediately came back together as one. This type of maneuver was repeated several times while we were watching it.
To the best of our estimate, this object was in sight for around 15 to 20 minutes before it seemed to fade away into the distance. At no time did we hear any sound coming from the object. The sky was clear and there was no visible moon or stars.
We are positive that this was not a star, plane, or any other type of conventional aircraft. It was something which defied explanation. I felt it was my duty to report this sighting to the proper authorities.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image consists entirely of handwritten text on what appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text reads as follows:

"The object started descending rapidly to the right of the horizon. The witnesses stated they could tell the O.D. was real and that it steered in one direction on its own accord as if under control. At 13:30 hrs e the object did a sharp turn and headed due S. The witnesses continued to watch the object as it did maneuvers. It was first observed as a dot in the sky, then as it came closer it took on the shape of a large dirigible balloon, as I looked closer it was irregular in shape and seemed to change shape slightly. This object was sighted for over 15 minutes before it disappeared completely out of sight. I would not say it was a balloon, nor do I believe it was a normal aircraft, I cannot identify this object."

22 February, 1953

On 22 February 1953 at about 1940 hours in the Central Dover area of Dover, Del., a resident of Dover observed an unusual aerial phenomenon, which was described as follows:

The witness stated that on the evening of 22 February 1953, at about 1940 hours, he observed a bright reddish-orange light in the sky which appeared to be stationary. This light was observed for several minutes and then began to move rapidly to the east, making a 90 degree turn, and then disappeared from view.

The witness described the object as reddish-orange in color, approximately the size of the moon, and was clearly visible to the naked eye. At times, the object appeared to pulsate or change in intensity. The witness estimated the speed of the object as approximately 400-500 mph. Attempts were made to locate the object again, but it was not observed.

This incident was reported to the Dover Air Force Base on 23 February 1953. The object was not detected on radar and no aircraft were reported in the area at the time of the sighting.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
AF FORM 112 - PART II
UNCLASSIFIED

In accordance with AFR 200-2, 29 April 1952, the following report is submitted:

29 February 1953 - This unit was alerted by the CD at Dover AFB at approximately 0200Z, 29 February 1953. A reported "flying object" was sighted over New Castle, Delaware. The CD control advised they had visual contact with the target for several minutes. The object was described as being approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, metallic in appearance, and estimated to be at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. The object apparently hovered and maneuvered for some time in the area of the New Castle Airport. The pilot of an F-94 aircraft, which was scrambled to investigate, reported that he sighted the object but was unable to close to within firing range due to the tremendous speed of the object. After approximately 30 minutes the object disappeared from view.

The weather during sighting was clear, unlimited visibility with a very bright haze layer at 20,000 feet.

The pilot's description indicates the object may have been a space vehicle for a very long time, but no definite conclusions can be drawn. The object was not identified and its purpose and origin remain unknown.

Pilot left 209 miles per hour has been a reviaw for 5 years in Pilot for 9 years with a total of 3,050 hours of which 255 hours in F-94 aircraft.

The wether during sighting was clear, unlimited visibility with a very high haze layer at 20000 feet. The light has a very brilliant intensity and was estimated to be visible for a radius of 60 miles.

Dear Sir Force Base, Delaware
22 February 1952

At approximately 2:00 hours, 22 February, acting in my capacity as O.D., I received a call from a [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] who reported that a strange object was observed and was moving in a strange fashion in the area. He estimated the object to be 4-5° above the horizon from his view-point, moving further to North and approximately over the town of Frederic, Delaware.

He further stated that the object appeared to be approaching and that it was predominately yellow in color. However, it also appeared to be slowly changing color, turning white, green, and red at various times. 

I immediately contacted the Dover AFB Tower to see if the tower personnel were able to observe this object. I was informed that they could not see any object to the above description in the direction I gave them.

I then stepped outside of the Base Theatre and was able to see this object due West of the base.

I estimated the object to be moving at approximately 500 to 600 mph and over the town of [redacted] which is West of the base.

I advised the ATIC of this phenomenon. Mr. [redacted] had further information on this incident that I do not have.

I feel that the object was manned and of a superior performance. The gradual change of color was quite odd and may have been some form of propulsion or control operation.
