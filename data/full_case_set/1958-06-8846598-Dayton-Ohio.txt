The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" marking how high the object was above the horizon, and a "B" marking how high the object was above the horizon when the observer last saw it. The second and third sketches show larger scenes with a person standing in the foreground and the curved horizon line in the background, with additional "A" and "B" markings to indicate the position of the object.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the instructions to "Place on 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it."

The second sketch contains three elements:
1. A sketch of a landscape with a person standing on a road.
2. A smaller sketch of a landscape with a curved horizon line.
3. A larger sketch of a landscape with a curved horizon line.

The text states that the second sketch is an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. 

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
