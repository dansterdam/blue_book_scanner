AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNIDENTIFIED CELESTIAL PHENOMENON - FLYOVER
PLACE (LOCALITY): HOUSTON, TEXAS 
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 20 MARCH 1952
DATE OF REPORT: 27 MARCH 1952
OBSERVER: Capt. D.S. STEPHAN, USAF, 4602ND AC&W SQ, ELLINGTON AFB, TEXAS
DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVATION:
1. On 20 March 1952, at approximately 1950 hours, Capt. D.S. Stephan observed an unusually bright light travel in a northwesterly direction at an extremely high rate of speed.  The light appeared to be much larger and brighter than an ordinary star and was a steady, not blinking, light.  The light was observed for approximately 10 seconds before it disappeared.
2. Capt. Stephan immediately alerted the control tower at Ellington AFB and the Houston City Police Department.  Capt. Stephan stated that he had been a pilot for 10 years and had never seen anything like this before.
3. There are no meteorological conditions which would account for this phenomenon.  The light was not the result of any aircraft, balloon, or astronomical activity and could not be identified.  The observation was made under ideal conditions for sighting and the reliability of the observer is unquestioned.
4. It is requested that this report be forwarded to the Commanding General, Air Force Intelligence, for further study and evaluation.
