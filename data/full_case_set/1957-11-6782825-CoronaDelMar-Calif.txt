Dear Sir:

Please refer this letter to the proper department, concerning inquiry into reports of UFO.

All pertinent information is in the story enclosed. In this week's issue of Newsweek, a photographic reproduction by certain newspadiermen, not given to hysteria or illusion, is not called to your attention, good sirs.

You have a perfectly normal and logical explanation of what I saw at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 12. If so, would you please inform The sketch below will give you an idea of the relative size of the object and direction of motion. There were no clouds nearby. The object was very clearly defined, not fuzzy and almist perfectly straight.

It's about a half moon.

WHATZI? THIS TIME?
"ME BBE THOSE RUSSIANS 
JUST MISSED THE MOON"

No Sputnik this time, I hope.  But it's sure a whatzit!
While I was driving home from the Newport City Council meeting. I spotted a light moving across the sky, It was coming from the south toward the east. I stopped and looked at it, and I gazed at the moon, which was low in the sky and just a little to the left of my direction of travel.

The light, maroon-black object, resembling a huge cone, or a fin, flew by, fast, at an angle across the face of the moon, from left to right. It appeared to turn slightly, then disappeared in the darkness beyond the immediate light of the moon.

The light had stopped the car. Just on the easterly end of the light, there seemed to be some sort of a dark, indistinct object, which was moving through the open sky. The first impulse had been to brush at any eyes, then to look again. It was not contina. It was moving in a straight line across the face of the moon in a southerly direction.

The time to check the time, made note of by car clock, made note of the date, and cold sober. Only possible observation could come from an affliction known as "uucilitis", which two-results from some 9-hours of listening to City Council's meanderings.

That's the story. You name it.

These 3 were up setting many as the underdog Gatas has removed the doorman who carefully but firmly sustained co llections. The Michigan State to man's school.
