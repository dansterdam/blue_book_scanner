AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM (AGENCY) Flight 3-H, 46024 ATIS
REPORT NO. SH-UFOB-1-56
SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
1. A check was made with the U.S. Weather Bureau at Byrd Field, Richmond, Va. to determine whether there was any weather balloon launched at the time of the sighting. Records indicate no balloon was launched at Byrd Field (3 seconds duration) of brightening into the vicinity of Hampton-Sydney, Va. on the date and time of the UFO sighting.
ALTITUDE: DIRECTION: WIND VELOCITY:
6,000 NNW 34 K
10,000 NNW 35 K
14,000 NNW 38 K
20,000 NNW 45 K
30,000 NNW 53 K
40,000 NNW 58 K
50,000 NNW 63 K
60,000 N 66 K
2. A check with the GGC Filter Center, Richmond, Virginia revealed that this agency had recognized no significant disturbances to the 7975th ACAW Radar at Camp Peary, Va. No other reports on the object other than the original report from observers were obtained.
3. The 6478th ACAW, Manassas, Virginia, was called by telephone for any information which might be available on the sighting. This installation was unable to offer any evidence to support the sighting.
4. Stated for comparison are the drops, however, additional information as to exact location or altitude of dropped objects was not readily available from the original sighting data. However, the object in Richmond, Va. (CODES UNSEEN) appeared to be at a much higher altitude than the reported UFO sighting.
5. As a result, no further information could be obtained to substantiate the radar data recorded at the approximate time of the sighting.
RADAR PLOT:
Track # 0625...(1) One aircraft or object, estimated speed 120 knots, altitude- 7,000 feet.
INITIAL PLOT:
S: 66112/JWMI4028 F: 0882/JWMG0091
E: 66193/JWMI1509 D: 0634Z/JVLB 2098
I: 66193/JWMI1509 J: 0637Z LOST CONTACT
6. The CAA tower at Byrd Field, Richmond, Va. was queried for possible information pertaining to objects which may have been observing the sighting. However, no information indicating the appearance and characteristics of an unidentified flying object was obtained.

Flight 3-R, 46054 A 123

7. Charge with air Traffic Control Center at Washington National Airport (GHJ 8656) for information which might serve to confirm the sighting yielded negative results.
8. - Call was placed to the US Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. (GHJ 8656) for some information as to whether a meteorological balloon had been released in this area at the reported time, but the Observatory was closed and Professor Pickering, who lives in the neighborhood, was frequently seen to sparkle almost as a diamond in the sky. This phenomenon was of unusual brilliance and duration, and its appearance and disappearance was gradual. The lights then became fuzzy, turned red, and then dim, appearing to fade away. There were no sounds or explosions. This information is considered to be the first sighting of this nature. The color of the light varied from brilliant white with a tinge of blue and green to a dull reddish-orange. The change in color seemed to be related to the distance, brightness and length of time the object was observed.
9.  - As a result of these inquiries, no corroborating evidence could be obtained to confirm the sighting. The object was described as a very bright light which seemed to be reflecting a variety of colors - from bright blue and brilliant white to dull reddish-orange. Its brightness varied from very brilliant to fairly dim. Some of the most significant points in the observation are:
a. It was observed between the hours of 1800 and 1900 by several persons.
b. The object appeared and disappeared gradually.
c. The color changed from white, to blue and green, to reddish-orange.
d. There were no sounds or explosions associated with the sighting.
e. The reported phenomenon had the appearance of a metallic, or reflecting object in the sky.
f. The observers were apparently intelligent and reliable persons.

SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: The professor's opinion is that the telescope has undoubtedly had been out of focus, which could account for the brilliant, variously colored light reported.

FLIGHT 3-8-T, 4602d AISS
TO: A sergeant with Hampton-Sydney College, Hampton, Virginia, reports that two lights were observed on 25 April 1956 at approximately 7:10 pm. He states that these lights were observed from the campus of the college and were approximately 38 feet off the ground, circular in shape, and approximately 15 to 20 feet in diameter. He states that the lights remained stationary for approximately 10 to 15 minutes and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared. He further states that the lights were a bright reddish-orange color and that there was no noise associated with the objects. He also states that he observed the lights through binoculars and that they remained stationary throughout the observation. It might be noted that Sirius would have been seen in approximately the same area of the sky at that time and that the objects observed might have been the planet Venus, which was visible in the western sky at that time. No photographs were taken of the objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Flight 7-h, 46002d AISS
Commanders of the Preparing Officer:
1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, the phenomenon observed on 22/06/51 at Sirius and Procyon when viewed below an angle of 10-15 degrees may have been an optical illusion or a refraction from the celestial bodies, Sirius and Procyon.

2. The fact is generally known among astronomers that the two stars mentioned are bright and high in the heavens, the diffraction-colored fringes appearing clear when viewed on a clear night.

a. The persisting nature of the UFO sightings augments the chance of its having been a balloon or balloons. The celestial bodies of sirius and Procyon having been in the approximate location of the UFOs for the duration of the latter's sighting suggests misinterpretation on the part of the observer.

(1) At this point it might be mentioned that if the observer had previously been acquainted with the appearance of diffraction-colored fringes around bright stars, this interpretation may have prevented any error.

Views with: For and in the absence of a definite observer or possibly definite evidence, the phenomenon is viewed as a probable optical illusion or refraction from the celestial bodies, sirius and Procyon.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was caused by the stellar sirius and Procyon.

he observed an unusual object in the sky, flickering and seemed to be moving in the direction of SW. 
SOURCE stated the object was a sphere, flickering, and appeared to be hovering under power. The object appeared to be about the size of a basketball, and gradually this angle appeared to decrease. After approximately 30 with the horizon and gradually this angle appeared to decrease. After approximately 30 
minutes the object appeared to disappear.

SOURCE would not estimate the distance to the object, however the size was not a "shooting star" but much larger. SOURCE stated that the object appeared bright and had a steady glow.

SOURCE further stated that there appeared to be a bright cone-shaped 
object behind the original UFOB, but that it had not been visible all the time. The condition of the sky at the time was clear and there were no clouds, and the lighting was good with unlimited visibility.

No photographs were taken of the UFOB.

After viewing the object for approximately 45 minutes, SOURCE finally lost sight of it.
