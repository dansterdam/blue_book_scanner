REGARDING YOUR REQUEST 0N JUNE 28, 1952 TO LOOK INTO SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WHICH WAS STILL VISIBLE, INFORMATION IS STILL RESTRICTED. THE ORIGINAL REPORT DOES NOT CONTAIN ENOUGH DATA FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY POSITIVELY THE OBJECT SEEN AS IT WAS APPARENTLY DARKS SILHOUETTE AGAINST AN EVENING SKY. MAKING DETAILED IDENTIFICATION IS NOT EASY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE DURATION OF SIGHTING WAS ONLY ABOUT 1.5 MINUTES OR LESS, AND WITNESS COULD NOT IDENTIFY IT WITH CERTAINTY. IT WAS SIMPLY 'THING' TO HIM AT THE TIME. THAT CONCLUDES MY REPORT ON THIS MATTER. LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this document. This appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report from the Project Blue Book case files.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUMMARY: Pilot sighted object at 15,000 feet altitude which was traveling at approximately 600 mph. The object was described as elliptical in shape, silver in color, and approximately 30 feet in diameter. It was observed for approximately 30 seconds. Other witnesses to the sighting were two B-17 crews. No other details are available.
ANALYSIS: The reported sighting is considered a possible genuine report. The apparent high speed and altitude of the object are beyond the normal capabilities of known aircraft. If the object observed was of the size and speed reported, it could not have been a conventional aircraft.
CONCLUSION: The object sighted is unidentified. Further investigation is warranted to obtain additional details.

The object was called to my attention by Mr. [redacted] as I was putting my car in the garage. It was located in the SW near Mt. [redacted] and remained in that position for about 15 minutes. It appeared to be circular in shape, silvery in color, and positively motionless. In relation to stationary objects, I viewed it with the naked eye and with binoculars.
I pointed it out to my father and sister on reaching home about 150 feet from where I first saw it. About 15 minutes after leaving him the object moved some distance east of a bright red to a bright green, blinking constantly. I decided to go where my father was and to wait until he arrived home in checking our observations agreed that it was changing in size like a pulsing neon light, that it was impossible to estimate its size. We tried repeatedly to estimate the distance but again and again concluded it was impossibly far away, perhaps 5 to 10 miles. The object continued growing smaller until last from view.
The object was very easy to find in the sky even after moving to other positions to study it.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PAGE 2 OF 3 PAGES

We didn't observe anything that might be described as a "flying saucer". On investigating the object seen in the sky, it was found to be a conventional aircraft, as heard and sighted minutes. We could not account for this object being noticed at all, as it was probably too far away to be seen very well, especially at night. The weather at the time was clear, visibility good, no moon or stars obstructed.

It should be noted that there has been no incident justifying suspicion of a secret weapons research project or the sighting. The object was almost certainly a conventional aircraft.

The incidents occurred on the night of 17 July at the time of the Mauch Chunk incident, which was claimed to have been twelve miles. The weather therefore was the same as observed locally: clear, visibility good, no moon or stars obstructed.

And the existing circumstances do indicate that both reports should be noted and compared, but there is little or no further investigation warranted or considered necessary under the present circumstances.

This opinion is unable to give any explanation for the sighting and remains inconclusive.

UNCLASSIFIED
It might be some concern among saucer scientists that if anything regarding the unexplained flying saucers or unidentified flying objects were admitted, it would lead to a vast public confusion and hyster ia. The Air Force for years has denied any weight to the saucer reports, and there are the difficulties of dealing with actual facts and proof of the sightings. There are some 16 recent sight ings and reports for which no explanation can yet be given. These seem to have exceeded those of the past, in the details and corroborative witne sses. While most sightings can be explained as planes, balloons, meteors, etc., there is an impression that some of the recent flights at high speeds and maneuvers are beyond our present scientific knowledge and technology. There is a feeling that many of the reports cannot be explained as conventional craft or natural phenomena. There is an apparent interest by the Air Force, and some collaboration by the FBI in investigating all significant reports. There is obviously a good reason for this, both as to public reaction and any technical intelligence factors. But there is an apparent reluctance to admit or confirm any substance to the sightings. Presumably, this is to avoid any undue alarm or speculation that might result. I wonder if this attitude is really advisable, in view of the apparent increase in good sightings, and the apparent exceeding of our present technology in some cases. There may be a need for more public enlightenment and explanation, if only to dispel the mystery and speculation that arises from official silence on the matter. The existence of some unidentified flying objects seems now fairly well established. The problem is how to treat it - with public reassurance, or continued secret investigation. These are difficult decisions, obviously, but they should be faced realistically.
