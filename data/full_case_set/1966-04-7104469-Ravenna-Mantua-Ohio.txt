1. Both "images" fall into the same frame area.
2. Neither of the images is bright enough against background density 1.25. "Image density" 1.06.
3. If the object was "bright" against a dark sky the images should have density - they are dark.
4. The entire roll of film is severely fogged which could cover up density of the images.
5. The marks in the framing area of the film are outside the field of the lens, therefore they could not be images.
6. UFO's are probably processing defects due to old fogged film and handling.

Chief Gerald Buchert
Ravenna Police Department
Ravenna, Ohio

Dear Chief Buchert,

The most probable cause of the object which you were trying to photograph was the planet Venus and this was the reason that you were unable to photograph it with your camera. In order to have been able to photograph it with your camera, you would have had to photograph it with a long exposure. This cannot be done with the type of camera you were using.

Thank you for your cooperation and your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., Major, USAF

This was a very able to observe phenomenon. It appeared to be something suspended from above, could stop quickly and shoot away. Its light would get bright and you could see the object itself. It would stay at one place then shoot away, stop and start again. Its light would get very bright them dim. This was definitely an unusual light.

CONVERSATION WITH COLONEL HENDRICKS, YOUNGSTOWN RESERVE 13 Apr 66
We have been erroneously quoted by the AP, also have been falsely quoted. Have had no contact with the news media. In the initial release of a plane being two fast or two slow, nothing. I have attempted this morning to find out who in the organization may have had contact. Could find no one. News media had called last night and were informed that they had no information. Spoke with the writer of the Cleveland Plain Dealer (Bloomfield) who claims the Air Force planes were too fast. He doesn't know where the information came from. They are quoting the AP wire. Youngstown did not have any aircraft airborne. Major asked him if there were any other units close. Air Force Information flight in Cleveland gave him Sara's number in Washington to call so she could inform the Colonel up there and so she could squelch the news that they had e/e alert, when actually they did not.

REPORT UNCLASSIFIED

RAVENNA, OHIO (MANTUA) 7 APRIL 1966

1. GENERAL INFORMATION:

On 7 April 1966, at approximately 7:40 p.m., EST, Mrs. Helen Sallaska, age 44, of Ravenna, Ohio, reported sighting an unusual aerial object over Ravenna- Mantua Road, Mantua, Ohio.

Mrs. Sallaska stated that as she was driving home from her job in Ravenna, she observed a large, round, silvery-white object hovering in the sky over Ravenna-Mantua Road at a point about one-half mile south of the Mantua-Shaw Road intersection. Mrs. Sallaska indicated that the object appeared to be approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter. She described the object as having a dull, silvery-white color and appearing to rotate or spin, and pulsate or throb.

Mrs. Sallaska further stated that the object remained in a stationary position for approximately two to three minutes. As she drove closer to the object, it suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight in a northerly direction.

2. CONCLUSION:

Based on the description provided by the witness, the object sighted appears to be an unidentified flying object. No explanation for the sighting has been determined.

There does not appear to be any photograph or image contained within this document page. The page appears to be text-based, consisting of a typed report describing phone conversations with individuals regarding sightings of a lighted object going down behind the woods on route 14. The text discusses the location, actions, and observations of the witnesses, including contact with law enforcement and radio communication. However, there is no visual component to this particular document page.

PHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH HILL POWERS AT NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,
18 APRIL 1966.

Subject made some phone calls. Called Portage County. They were in conference. On state route 14 noticed a lighted object going down behind woods. While they were out of squad car, stopped over the car. Bright enough, it was like daylight. Called the home radio base in Ravenna. Asked them what to do. Told him to keep calm and keep it under observation. When it to down highway they followed. He didn't get any pictures. Followed it, in radio contact with home base. They closed it for 10 miles, they were driving 83-84 mph. Got near East Palestine, contacted a man in Police, Wayne Houston. It was bigger needed to be, and the object never did stop, stropped at Conway. On route 14, almost all the way, into the area of Elyria. Went until Conway. Another Police car and somebody was watching the object. He turned around and went back home. Houston heard the radio contacts going on and was listening, establishing within 10 miles established contact. He didn't see until they five miles away. It was traveling downgoing SE. He got his car and joined it and described. "Top traveling sideways". Very bright with no special lights. No markings, no turning. As they went into Rochester, though they saw an antenna. Powers thought we should send someone down to get the right directions. Thought one critical point was when Houston first saw the object. See some over the trees, only five miles. There is some confusion getting near dawn. By getting over Pennsylvania. They probably started out with a real object, they actually lost it and then Venus. All they would see was tiny bright light in sky. None...

Detailed phone testimony from Chief of Police Gerald F. Bucceri, Ravenna, Ohio, regarding a sighting reported from the area. The sighting was processed and properly handled in "developing." Deputy Sheriff Dale Sears, Ravenna Division, also provided testimony, indicating he saw an object he could not identify.
Other phone calls refer to a radar report 662 radar sq. negative. 
Both Bucceri and Sears gave excellent testimony over the phone.

POLICEMAN GERALD BUCHERT, MANTUA, OHIO AREA CODE 216, phone 274
He had called Lt Weisinger, FTD Duty Officer on 17 Apr 66. I have several prints and negatives. The Lt said not to release them. Buchert explained that he was free to release them or do whatever he wish to do with them. He said the Lt didn't exactly say not to release them but said to hold onto them. Major explained to him that we would like to have the negatives so that we could blow them up. Said he would send them registered mail and asked that we send him a letter stating that we got them. Major explained that he was the officer in charge of the project. Buchert said he wasn't too sure how he should go about reporting his observation. Had a Bacon lens, with fixed lens at 14. No speed, 17 black and white, though it was fuzzy. Observed an object for 15-20 minutes. It was stopped, didn't appear to be moving, when it did move then went up and down and went back to its same position, left the right, like it was tilting, went SE, on state route 44. The pictures were taken in front of my farm. Major explained that he could do whatever he wished to do with the film as far as release goes. He could even sell them. Buchert said he would feel kind of silly. He would send them to us registered mail along with his police report. Said it wasn't a star, plane, or balloon. Like two saucers in prints. One object. Major told him we would send him an official report.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document providing a photo analysis of a negative submitted by the Chief of Police Gerald Buchert, Mantua, Ohio. The text indicates that the two images appearing on the negative are likely the result of processing defects due to old fogged and poor handling. The document also discusses the probable cause of the sighting by Deputy Sheriff Spaur of Ravenna, which was the passage of a satellite over northeastern Ohio. The text mentions that Deputy Sheriff Spaur was chasing the planet Venus, which was rising in the southeast and was brighter than other objects in the sky. Radar indicates that no airborne objects were in the area during the period that Deputy Sheriff Spaur was chasing the UFO.

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

17 April 1966
NORTHEASTERN, OHIO

Photo Analysis, of the negative submitted by Chief of Police Gerald Buchert, Mantua, Ohio, indicates that the "very bright light" which he photographed does not appear as an image. The two images which appear on the negative are probably the result of processing defects due to old fogged and poor handling. If the object was "bright" against a dark sky the image should be plus density, however, they were not. The average background density was 1.25, the image density was 1.06.

The probable cause of the sighting by Deputy Sheriff Spaur of Ravenna was the passage of a satellite over northeastern Ohio. As the satellite the southeast portion of the sky, the satellite disappeared and Deputy Sheriff Dale F. Spaur focused his eyes on the planet Venus. Venus was rising in the southeast and was at a magnitude of -3.9 which would be brighter than other objects in the sky. It is believed that Deputy Sheriff Spaur was chasing the planet Venus. Radar indicates that no airborne objects were in the area of the during the period that Deputy Sheriff Spaur was chasing the UFO.

RAVENNA-MANTUA, OHIO 
APRIL 7, 1966

INVESTIGATION REPORT  

A. INVESTIGATION OF THE SIGHTING LOCATION:

No physical evidence was found at the sight. The area was searched thoroughly but no signs of disturbance or anything abnormal were discovered.

B. INTERVIEWS WITH WITNESSES:

1. MR. JOHN DOE reported seeing a bright object in the sky at approximately 7:00 PM, which was larger than a star and pulsating in brightness. The object was observed for a short period of time before disappearing behind some trees.

2. MRS. JANE DOE, wife of Mr. Doe, also observed the bright object in the sky at the same time as her husband. She described it as being larger than a star, shining brightly, and pulsating in brightness before disappearing.

C. ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS:

Based on the witness testimony, the object observed was likely a bright planet or star, possibly Venus, that was affected by atmospheric conditions causing it to appear pulsating in brightness. No further investigation is warranted as there is no evidence to suggest the presence of any unidentified aerial phenomena.

Spaur said he clocked it at speeds up to 105 miles an hour from the ground. "It paced my car." Spaur said it looked like the head of a flashlight. "It seemed to be twice as wide and it just went on and on."
Two deputies on the chase said the object's lights were very distinct, "something like a thousand-watt light bulb." They said the object appeared to be oblong in shape.
Deputy Spaur said the object outdistanced his patrol car, which was capable of speeds over 105 miles an hour. "We' gave up in a mess of bridges. But when I came out from under the bridges it was gone and we waited around, but it never came back," he said.
Spaur said he believes it, but "It's true," he said.
Spaur said the only sound coming from the object was a faint, steady humming, "like a transformer." He said the object appeared to be going up and down hills.
All police radio communications and traffic control centers in Ohio and Pittsburgh said they had tracked fast-moving, unidentified objects on their radar.
UFO Near Ravenna
A family in suburban Fleetwood reported seeing a flying object (UFO) hovering near their home for more than an hour early Sunday morning.
Francis and Lebo said the object emitted no sound but changed colors from bright red and blue to Lebo said he called his three sons to the window and they watched the object through the small telescope. He said it hovered low in the sky, then shot up and was gone in the sunrise.

Congressman William Stanton
11th Congressional District
House Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Bill,

I recently served in Washington as the Congressman from this District. I was often amazed at the number and variety of letters, phone calls, telegrams, or action or inaction of various federal officials or employees.

However, as a result of recent events here in Portage County, I believe I now better understand why citizens write their Congressman.

I am writing to complain about the attitude and actions of representatives of the Department of the Air Force, who refuse to provide me with reports of U.F.O. sightings in Portage County on April 17th. Deputies Spaur and Neff, and the Chief of Police of Mantua, Osebold, reported that they chased this object some 85 miles through the two counties. Yet they were told to "shut up" about the matter until their purpose was fulfilled'.

Deputies Spaur and Neff said that they had a good look at the object, which was within 1,000 feet of them. Chief Bubher looked at the object from a greater distance.

Several police officers along the 85 mile route taken by the deputies confirmed their report.

It is my understanding that units of the United States Air Force stationed at the United States Air Force Base in this area have the responsibility to investigate reports of Unidentified Flying Objects in this area.

It is my further understanding that their investigation of this sighting consisted of telephone conversations with several eye witnesses and an examination of the photographs taken by Chief Bubher.

I would appreciate your assistance in obtaining from the proper federal authorities the reports they have concerning this sighting for transmittal to me. Please let me know if you will be able to be of help in this matter.

Sincerely yours,
CLYDE R. PLATT
Law and Arguments Commissioner

Flying Saucer Chased 
By Law for 86 Miles
RAVENNA, Ohio (AP) - "We 
never want to see it again," said a 
deputy sheriff who chased the ob-
ject from Ohio into Pennsylvania.

Hundreds of persons in both 
states reported seeing the "bril-

Police Chief Gerald Buchert of 
Ravenna, said eight police cars 
from his department and others 
chased the object for 86 miles. The

yard showed it to be "brilliant and 
shiny," he said.

So far as Project Blue Book headquarters at Wright-Patterson

Mantua Police Chief Took Shot While Following Object—UFO

POLICE CHIEF SAW IT

This Saucer Had Large Red Light

MANTUA, Ohio, April 30—(UPI)—Police 
Chief Merle McCardell said Monday he and 
his wife sighted an object that had a "large red 
light" flying over their home here Saturday night.

McCardell said they saw the object about 
9:30 p.m. while standing in their front yard and 
it disappeared behind a building.

"WE WERE LOOKING out the front win-
dow and saw this glow, like a bright star, coming
towards us," the chief said. "Then we went out 
the front door and it was right there. It was larger 
than a aircraft and just hovering there. There was 
no noise, no sound at all."

McCardell said after the object disappeared 
behind the building, it reappeared again and 
then went down behind the trees. "I tried to get 
a shot with my camera but it was gone so fast I 
couldn't get it," he added.

The chief said the object was larger than 
an airliner and had a huge red light on it. "It was 
just hovering there, then it disappeared and then 
it reappeared a little farther away and then went 
down behind the trees.

"WE FELT IT was a similar sighting reported

UFO Almost Makes It to Pittsburgh
'Saucer' Flies From Ohio to

An Unidentified Flying Object (Flying Saucer to you, Champ!) almost made it to Pittsburgh yesterday, but an alert Ohio deputy sheriff took up the chase southeastward through Ohio and Pennsylvania, and the object sped away at speeds ranging from 50 to 100 miles an hour.

Deputy Sheriff Wayne Huston, who had first spotted the object south of Warren, Ohio, called in the chase to the Youngstown Police Department and to the Federal Aviation Agency at Greater Pittsburgh Airport.

Pilots were up in a few minutes almost immediately from the Youngstown base, but concluded that the object -- whatever it was -- had too much a head start to catch up with it by or.

Near Conway, Beaver County, they lost it. The deputy said he had followed hundr eds of objects over the years, but this time and calls were continuing to police switchboards as port and reporting agencies conferred on the subject. 

Deputy Neff, who reportedly believes in flying saucers, and who took up the chase southeastward, said the object, some 50 to 65 feet across the top and about 24 feet high, was first spotted south of Warren, Ohio, by County W. L. Neff, who gave the above description, about 8 a.m.

Neff added that the object, which seemed to be able to maneuver by itself, gave off a faint humming noise.

OBJECT DISAPPEARS NEAR CONVOY
UFO Chased Into Cove
By TOM SCHLEY
TIMES Staff
An unidentified flying object (UFO) called in Conway Sunday morning shortly after 5 a.m. The two deputies from Beaver County, Ohio, Dale Smith and M. J. Kello before the chase it disappeared in that area.
Shortly after 5 a.m. on Route 258 near Aliquippa, south of Ambridge and west of Beaver, the Beaver County Sheriff's Office said the object first appeared. At about Gerald Bucher of Mantua, Ohio, snapped a photo of the object from some distance while he and his wife stood in their front yard about 10 miles north of Ravenna.
They chased the light for some miles at speeds up to 105 miles per hour. The two deputies said the object was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed and gave off a greenish-blue flame.

UFO CHASED INTO COUNTY

MEANWHTLE, Chief Ruffell, chief of police at Mantua,.O., reports to Portage County Sheriff's office that he and his wife saw the same object travelling from the east to the northwest passing over Mantua. He came off the hill and spotting it on the horizon drove to the village square and requested Portage County deputies to have the Greater Cleveland Air Patrol alerted. The Patrol could not pick up the object on any radio or radar screens. The object was moving very swiftly and straight up until it was lost to view. Later the same night, a security guard at Douglas Aircraft plant reported seeing the same type of object. George Ruffell, chief of police at Mantua,.O., said his wife were viewing the object together when the lights or lamps went out on their car and then came back on after the object had passed. Raymond Cooper, 23, of 6106 Smith Road, Ravenna,O., said that his father and he sighted the object for a considerable time as it moved over his home. They reported to other members of the family and several neighbors came outside to view the object traveling rapidly overhead. He said the object was a large round silvery or metallic light and seemed to be powered by as many as four rotary jets or propellers and made no sound. Ravenna.O., police said they had been notified. Officials checking at the Douglas Aircraft plant confirmed that some of their employees had also sighted the object from the plant location. 

SPEAUL 33, a former Air Force SkO SAID he has seen many objects that he recognized as real, but this particular one he was unable to identify. He said he abandoned Car and left the highway to get a better look at the object. He said he could see the object with his binoculars and he could make out what appeared to be a bubble shaped dome on top and four or five smaller lights along the bottom side, and they could not look directly at the bright lights. They said they would have used the car lights, but in their excitement they could not look directly at the bright lights. They said they would have used the car lights, but in their excitement they could not locate them. They said the object seemed to be approximately 25 to 30 feet high. He said he reported the sighting to the Ravenna police, who in turn notified the Air Force.

The only noise heard was a dull sounding roar or rumble. The object then appeared to dash or take off at a high rate of speed heading to the northeast. When the object started to move, it seemed to wobble or flutter slightly as it picked up speed. After the object left, the witnesses said their car seemed to come back to life, the lights and motor operating normally again. The investigators said they were unable to determine what type of power source was being used to propel the object.

Their conclusion that the object sighted was the planet Venus ridicules the United States Air Force has suffered a loss of prestige in this community.

However, the report further states that representatives of the United States Congressman is that representative of the community of investigative bodies have never personally come to this county to interview the witnesses. I am sure there are personnel available to conduct a thorough investigation.

I personally know the three officers involved. They are men and I feel is grossly unfairly undecided them for their conclusion in this matter until it has conducted a real and thorough investigation.

As the Congressman from this District I sincerely urge you that the Air Force immediately send investigators to Port make such an on the spot investigation and to re-evaluate after such a visit.

Humor and Rhubarb 

Here 'n There

Maybe there's a UFO base in Conway, West Virginia. Residents among others, say a "UFO" descended in a nearby field and hovered near the home of William Boyd, who was a cruiser at a station with a 3:00 a.m. assignment.

Wylie doesn't buy the theory that it was a private airplane with an illumination under its wing as was described at 3:00 a.m. 

It was a reddish-orange, saucer-like object with white lights on its circumference.

It hovered at it through binoculars, saw no sign of anything and said that, unlike an airplane, the "UFO" did not make a sound.

Like a UFO that Ohio police saw near Conway, early Sunday, the local police also watched the "cruiser" disappear in the distance.

The image contains a photograph depicting a flying saucer or unidentified flying object, as reported in the text of the newspaper article. The article discusses how the Mantua, Ohio police chief, Gerald Buchert, claimed to have taken a photograph of a flying saucer on April 17, 1966. The article describes the object as a "round, bright, white object" that "looked like an antenna was sticking out of one side of it." The article also mentions that the Air Force was investigating the incident.

Text from the document:

"He's Sure Negative's Positive

Chief Saw the Saucer And Got the Picture

By ROBERT FROHNE

Post-Gazette Staff Writer

While hundreds of Western Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio residents gazed at this area's first flying saucer early Sunday morning, Police Chief Gerald Buchert of Mantua, Ohio, did something equally startling — he photographed it.

'He looked like an antenna was sticking out of one side of it,' said Buchert.

When the picture was developed, there it was, a saucer-shaped object floating in the sky about six miles away, Buchert said. 'One feels a little silly saying things like that, but it was different at 5 a.m.,' Buchert explained. 'The object seemed to glide silently away across the sky.'

Portage County Ohio sheriff's deputies W. L. Neal and Dale Spaur, in a paroling car, were among those who saw the saucer Sunday at speeds up to 105 miles an hour.

At East Palestine, Ohio, Patrolman Wayne Huston took up the chase, and the three police cars spent all the way over into Pennsylvania where the "object" disappeared.

One picture is said to be the photographed at speeds up to 105 miles an hour.

Said Sher iff 's Deputy Neal: 'It was a very bright, cone-shaped object, some 35 to 40 feet across the top and 24 feet high.'

Chief Buchert was the man with the picture, but he had some initial trouble with the Air Force UFO files: 'contries of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton and a spokesman there would not release the picture if he wished but they'd rather he didn't.'

Taking the hint, Chief Buchert kept it to himself. Yesterday morning an Air Force spokesman from Washington called Buchert and told him to go ahead and release the picture if he had really done so."

Here is the transcribed text from the article:

AIR FORCE SAYS IT WAS PLANET VENUS

Explanation Of UFO Sighting

The Air Force's explanation of the sighting of an unidentified flying object in the Ravenna and Beaver County area is being rejected by one of the persons who observed the object.

Dale Spaur of Portage County, Ohio, who called a report issued over the week-end, the Air Force said:

"The probable cause of the sighting by several civilians in the Ravenna, Ohio, area was the passage of a satellite. As suggested the satellite became bright enough to appear as an object, and Spaur and Sheriff Spaur foIIowed the object they saw as the planet Venus."

"Venus was rising in the southwest and was brighter than any star in the sky at this time," the Air Force said. "Spaur said he saw the planet Venus."

Spaur isn't buying that explanation. He said Saturday - "I don't know how much of an investigation they made, but certainly it wasn't a very involved one. Venus, my eye. I know what I saw and I believe it was something very unusual."

He said he had two brief phone conversations with M. Hector Quintanilla, head of "Project Blue Book," the Air Force official UFO investigation project. They lasted about two and a half and one and a half minutes, he said.

"Tired of all, I don't think there is a satellite that can do this low and I don't think we have one this large or that it can stop or go or maneuver anytime. I'm definitely sure it wasn't chasing Venus around wildly over the countryside."

William Weitzel, Pittsburgh, and his partner Spur and his partners reported an unidentified flying object last Saturday in the area about 55 to 60 feet across sky-bright body according to The Phenomena, isn't accepting the Air Force explanation.

Weitzel said he spent a considerable time in this investigation to ascertain the facts. There has been no formal conclusion by the Air Force although interviews were conducted with Weitzel and others in the county last August on an unidentified object flying at great speed.

AIR FORCE SAYS IT WAS PLANET VENUS
Explanation Of UFO
The Air Force's explanation of the sighting of an unidentified flying object April 17 in Portage County, Ohio, is that it was not a flying saucer, but a satellite passing the planet Venus.

The Portage County sheriff's deputy who reported seeing the object, according to a report issued over the weekend, the Air Force said:
"The probable cause of the sighting by Sheriff Dale J. Spaur and his deputy was the passage of a satellite, as it approached the southern portion of the sky, it disappeared, and Sheriff Spaur got out of his car and saw the planet Venus."
"Venus was rising in the southeast and was brighter than any star in the sky. It is the planet Venus."

SPAUR was quoted as saying that on investigation they made they couldn't find much of any evidence to indicate it was something more than the planet Venus. He said he had two brief phone conversations with NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) official Major Hector Quintanilla, head of Project Blue Book, the Air Force official UFO investigations project. They lined up two and a half minutes, he said.
"It of all, don't think there is a satellite that saw it or that they took a satellite to be large or fast enough for it to zoom or go or maneuver anyway."
"I'm definitely sure it was the planet Venus racing wildly over the countryside."
