This image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page provides a report from the Bergstrom AFB Weather Facility, including details about cloud cover, weather conditions, and a possible sighting or report. The report mentions "a thousand scattered, unmeasured overcast" and "thunder storm activity in the local area and to the north." It also mentions a "slight inversion 7,000 - 7,500 feet, top at 45 thousand feet."

The text also includes a section labeled "PAGE 4 COMMENTS," which discusses the inability to match the reported sighting with anything, and states that the "object visible in the western sky at approximately this time of the evening" had a cloud cover that "possibly account for the apparent movement and varying in brightness that was reported."

Overall, this document appears to be a detailed report related to a UFO sighting or observation, likely from the 1960s based on the date provided in the file name.

X- RICHARD E. MCLAINE, MAJOR, USAF, 75 PRW, TAG: PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION REVEALS NOTHING THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THIS REPORT.
HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE OBJECT SIGHTED WAS A BRIGHT PLANET THAT IS VISIBLE IN THE WESTERN SKY AT APPROXIMATELY THIS TIME OF THE EVENING. THE CLOUD COVER THAT WAS PRESENT AT THE TIME COULD POSSIBLY ACCOUNT FOR THE APPARENT MOVEMENT AND VARYING IN BRIGHTNESS THAT WAS REPORTED.
