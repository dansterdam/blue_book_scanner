Transcription of the text from the document:

The Unidentified Object

We were flying at 7500 ft. at an airspeed of 165 M/P/H and heading of 075 degrees in T-33 at 1530 hrs CST on 29 Oct. 1952. The subject object appeared into my cone of vision from the left slightly above the horizon. It was rising and passed out of sight to the right. The object appeared somewhat perpendicular to the course line of the aircraft. It was larger than a T-33 aircraft and a degree of illumination which caused a definite sense of illusion caused by terrific speed. A definite shape could not be determined. The line of flight was very straight with a constant state of acceleration and an approximate angle of attack of 5 Degrees.
