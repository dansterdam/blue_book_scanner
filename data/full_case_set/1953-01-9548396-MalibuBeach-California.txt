to Calif.
SANTA ANA, Calif., Jan. 29 — Reports by several persons, including a commercial pilot, of disk-shaped objects streaking over Southern California skies were under investigation today by Air Force, Marine Corps and CAA officials.
Four such objects were reported flying in a tight formation over the city at various times today. A pilot of a Northrop Aircraft Co. plane said he chased a fiery object for several minutes, but was unable to overtake it. At the same time, control tower operators at Long Beach Municipal Airport reported seeing what they said was a "large, brilliant flame" in the sky.
The two airmen and a photographer at Long Beach said they watched the objects for about five minutes until they disappeared. Photographer Jim Wilkinson did try to photograph them, but was unable to do so.
The Marine pilot failed to identify the object, but he said it had been clear for some 25 miles when he chased it. Lake Elsinore, 120 miles southeast of Los Angeles, discussed the possibility that it was a star re-entry, but astronomers said that was unlikely.
The tower controller at Long Beach reported hearing a rumbling, like coming from a jet, some distance away.

The image contains a newspaper article with a headline that reads "Jet Pilot Chases "Fiery Disc" Over California Marine Base". The article describes a pilot who chased a "fiery object" over the Marine Corps Base near Santa Ana, California. The object was described as a "fiery disc" and was tracked at high speed. The article provides details about the incident, including that the object was seen by several witnesses and was estimated to be thousands of feet near the airport. The article also mentions that the object disappeared several minutes later, flying over the ocean at high speed.

The text of the document is as follows:

Jet Pilot Chases "Fiery Disc" 
Over California Marine Base
SANTA ANA, Calif., Jan. 29 (AP)—The Marine Corps base here today reported that a jet pilot "chased a fiery object" last night which was traveling at "tremendous speed."
The spokesman said the pilot failed to identify the object which was coming in for a landing in the Laguna Beach, California, Laguna City, Utah, sighting of the object appearing for several minutes later.
The pilot was said to have been chasing the object at a speed of 500 miles per hour and had been able to get within 1,000 yards of it. The object was described as being "fiery" in appearance.
Major Patton said the object appeared to be about 25 miles from the base and was moving at tremendous speed. He added that the pilot had expended all of his fuel in the chase and had to land because of the fuel shortage.

CASE #23
29 JAN 53
Malibu Beach, California
A newspaper reporter called March 1953 intelligence officer and reported that a U.S. Coast Guard plane with approximately 5,000 hours flying time was flying in a twin-engine beach craft near Malibu Beach at 9,000+ altitude on a 3 course when he observed it by radar. The plane was estimated to be 35 size flying in a vertical plane at approximately 20,000*. Speed estimate was 12,000 mph on a 3 minute course. The object disappeared in the direction of Riverside, California.

ATIC Comments and Conclusion
Although the pilot was considered to be reliable, there was enough information available to this headquarters for proper analysis. Therefore, our conclusion is insufficient data for evaluation.

Memorandum for Record

On 21 Jan 53, Capt. E. J. Ruppelt conducted the 4/T of the 27th Air Division, 4707th Air Defense Wing. On this flight, the ground was noted as being free of the glints from the sun that had marked many of the sightings during the past week or so. He stated that the 27th Air had only one sighting during this period. Fighters were scrambled but no contact was made. A cross-check with the GCI showed a weather balloon.

He stated that all during the period of these reports, 28, 29, and 30 January, no unidentified radar tracks correlated with the UFO reports. He knew nothing of the Northern report except that a newspaper said that the GCI tower's Santa Monica had seen four or five UFOs on 1/17/53. He had no knowledge of the Marine indication.
