AFR 200-2
d. Processing, answering, and taking action on correspondence received from the general public pertaining to the public relations, interest, and informational aspects of the unidentified flying objects program will be forwarded to AFSC (AFSC-PRIC) for action and reply.

7. Releasing Information:
a. The Office of Information, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, will handle all public or unofficial releases concerning UFO's, regardless of origin or nature. This includes letters to correspondents (except congressional inquiries), authorities, and other Air Force activities by reason of status, investigation, or analysis of sightings.

8. Exceptions:
In response to local inquiries regarding any UFO reported in the vicinity of an Air Force base, the commander of the base concerned may release information to the general public within only a limited geographic area for local public interest. The commander must exercise care not to make any classified aspects of the sighting or event a matter of public discussion. (paragraph 17) If the sighting is inexplicable or difficult to identify, because of insufficient information or inconsistencies, the only statement to be released is the fact that the sighting is under investigation. No additional details will be available at a later date. After completion of investigation, the commander, unless directed otherwise, will provide the results of the investigation. He will not give any further informationto the local public or news media.

9. Releases by Non-Air Force Sources: If newsmen, writers, publishers, or private individuals desire to release unilaterally information concerning any UFO sighting, every effort to assure that the statements, descriptions, and allegations of these individuals or groups are not associated with or represented as official information.

10. Contacts: Private individuals or organizations desiring Air Force information concerning UFO's will be referred to the Office of Information, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. Personnel other than those of the Office of Information, will not contact private individuals or groups, nor will they give out any information concerning UFO's unless so directed.

12. Methods for Transmitting Reports:
a. Together with any necessary supporting data and investigations preparatory to reporting, report all information on UFO's promptly. Electrical transcription of the reports will be made only if the situation is such that time is of the essence.
b. Submit written reports of sightings over 3 days old on AF Form 112, "Intelligence Report."

and AF Form 112A, "Supplement to AF Form 112" (see paragraphs 14 and 15); however, keep the use of these forms to a minimum in initial sightings. The delays often involved in getting reports through channels may make follow up investigation, producing only limited usable information. This factor is a necessary consideration. Reports received will determine action. AF Form 112 will provide a followup and/or completion report of all sightings initially reported electronically.

13. Where To Submit Reports:

a. Electrical Reports. Submit multiple addressed electrical reports to:
(1) Air Defense Command, Ent AFB, Colorado
(2) Nearest Air Division (Defense) (For United States only)

12 October 1962
SUBJECT: Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14
1. Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects, has been in continuous operation since 1947. Its purpose is to collect, analyze, and evaluate data on unidentified flying objects; and to determine if they represent something new of scientific interest, a threat to national security, or simply misidentified conventional objects.
2. Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 summarizes the results of the Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects for the period 1 January 1955 through 30 April 1963. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of all cases investigated during this period and presents the Air Force's conclusions regarding the nature of unidentified flying objects.
3. The report concludes that no unidentified flying object reported, investigated, and evaluated by Project Blue Book has ever given any indication of a threat to our national security. Further, there is no evidence that unidentified flying objects represent technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientific knowledge. In short, the report states that the continued study of unidentified flying objects does not offer a fruitful field in which to gather scientific data.

HISTORY OF PROJECT

Following the Kenneth Arnold sighting on 24 June 1947, wide news coverage of public reports of "flying discs or unidentified flying objects" created sufficient concern among military echelons to authorize AMC to conduct a preliminary investigation into the reports. Earlier data were examined and indicated that U.S. Missile Monitors were concerned about configurations more advanced than those possessed by the United States Armed Forces. A letter, 23 September 1947, from the Commanding General of the Army Air Forces, expressed the opinion that the public accounts submitted in the reports to warrant a detailed study.

On 30 December 1947, a letter from the Chief of Staff directed AMC to..."get up a project whose purpose was to collect, collate, evaluate and distribute to interested Government Agencies and contractors all information concerning UFO sightings and phenomena in the atmosphere which can be considered to be of concern to the National Security..."

The Technical Intelligence Division of AMC issued TID AMC Technical Instruction No. 2152: 11 February 1949, and the project was inaugurated with a code name of "SIGN." The code name "SIGN" was changed to the code name "GRUDGE" on 16 December 1949. A report released in December 1949 covering analysis of the first 273 incidents concluded that, while no definite and conclusive evidence indicated that these objects were of interplanetary origin, the reports revealed the possibility of a psychological mechanism at work.

After the Project "SIGN" Report, work continued along the same lines and a Project "GRUDGE" Report was published and released in August 1949 by AMC. This report contained an analysis of 2,336 reports and concluded that Unidentified Flying Objects reports resulted from: a) misidentification of conventional Flying Objects, b) hoax and c) psychopathological illness. The report recommended that further investigation and study of this type of report be reduced in scope. Major portions of this work were performed under contract by Ohio State University.

Professor Hynek (Present Consultant to AF on Project Blue Book), The RAND Corporation, Dr. G. Valley, Dr. Paul Fitts, Air Weather Service, 3610th Electronic Section and the U.S. Weather Bureau.

Following investigation of the "GRUDGE" Report, the Air Force continued to investigate sightings, inasmuch as it is an Air Force responsibility to identify and analyze any phenomena that could possibly be a menace to the United States. Much of the Scientific and Technical work during 1950 and 1951 centered around Project "Twinkle" and the Green Fireball studies of Dr. LaPaz in the Southwestern United States. Project "Twinkle" Final Report was completed on 27 December 1951. During December 1951 Colonel Frank Dunn became director of Project Blue Book. This project continues the feasibility of a scientific study from the data collected since the program's inception. Thus, Project Blue Book's Special Report #14 came into being.

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There does not appear to be any photograph or image included on this specific page. The text on the page appears to be a summary of an incident that occurred on June 20, 1957, when a private pilot reported sighting a glowing object in the sky. The report discusses the details of the incident and the objectives of the Project Blue Book investigation.

UFO SIGHTING

I. SUMMARY OF INCIDENT

On June 20, 1957, a private pilot named Harold opposed that while flying at an altitude of approximately 7,500 feet, he sighted an unusual object that appeared to be glowing. The object was described as round in shape and larger than a usual aircraft. It was traveling at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view within seconds.

II. OBJECTIVES OF PROJECT

The project has three objectives:
1. To determine if UFOs constitute a threat to our national security.
2. To determine if UFOs are interplanetary in origin or of a scientific nature.
3. To provide news media with information regarding the project and its results.

III. REPORT REQUESTED FROM INVESTIGATIVE OFFICER

The 1950-52 phase of the project has been completed. The report requested will provide a summary of the project's activities and findings to date, including any new developments or information that may have a bearing on the project's objectives.

APR 20 - A SPECIAL for the attention of the Commanding General is requested, as it is felt that when the final report is made, it will indicate the necessity for the continuance of this project.

As the final investigation will establish the true nature of the sightings, which will either confirm or deny the existence of UFOs, it is felt that the project should be continued until a definite conclusion can be reached.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) sightings.

The text on the page appears to be an analysis and discussion of UFO reports and investigations during the 1952-1955 time period. It discusses the formation of a Scientific Advisory Panel to examine UFO data, Air Force responsibility for the UFO program, and various briefings and meetings related to UFO topics.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) output:

During the phase in which Special Report #14 was in preparation (1952 - 1955) the project attracted a public felation fconact remains with it today. Fiction publications of alleged contacts with visitors from outer space, formation of pseudo-scientific organizations, hoaxes, and self-appointed individuals who investigated UFO sightings. The radar sightings in Washington- D. C. during July 1952 tended to give a new impetus to UFO reports. News coverage during this period was extremely high and General Samford conducted a press conference on 29 July 1952 to explain the situation. 

With the increased volume of reports pouring in, a Scientific Advisory Panel on UFO was established in late 1952. At a meeting held during 14 - 18 January 1953 all available data was examined. Conclusions and recommendations on this panel were published in an unclassified report, and made public. The panel concluded that UFO's did not threaten the National Security of the U.S. and recommended that the Air Force attitude on the project be removed.

By 1953 Air Force responsibility for the UFO program had become firmly established. It was now apparent that some directives were necessary in order to standardize investigative procedures and formulate policy. AFR 200-2 was issued, and the final publication was distributed in August 1954. This regulation states the purpose, investigative procedures and policies relating to the release of information. Special Report #14 was completed on 17 March 1954.

After 1955 the project concerned itself with investigation of sightings, evaluation of the data and information to provide a basis for a public appraisal. This often led to the "FACT SHEET" These, or similar releases have been made periodically since 1955. All data collected has been in accordance with the recommendations of the Scientific Panel in January 1953. Still, the "Flying Saucer Myth" had remained with the public eye, and has necessitated many conferences and briefings among Military, Civilian, Scientific, and Congressional members. Among the most significant of these are: a) 4 October 1956, The General Science Briefing, b) 31 January 1953, McClellan Sub-Committee Briefing, c) 8 August 1953, McCormack Sub-Committee Briefing, e) February 1959, Washington D. C. Policy Meetings and f) 11 - 15 July 1961, Congressional Briefing (Mr. Robert Smart).

As far back as 1952 recommendations have been made to discontinue the project or transfer it to civilian agencies or contractors. However, continuation of the project under Air Force auspices is likely. Letter Church (General Samford) expressed factors that are still pertinent on a continual need for project and indicated that reductions in staff carried.
CURRENT SITUATION: Personnel associated with the project are engaged in receipt of UFO reports, investigation and analysis of these reports and maintenance of scientific correspondence files. In addition, information programs of 2,000 letters a year from individuals requesting information on the UFO program from 1952 - 1965 the files were reviewed and placed in a standard format. Statistics were recomputed on the basis of the actual case files.
The fact sheet was revised to provide information most often requested by individuals and to disseminate the yearly statistics. Periodic case summaries on cases or public interest are released. The current AFR 200-2 is under revision. Present Project Officer is Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.

Here is the text from the document, as produced by an OCR system:

Includes a good evaluation of the data in his report. Experiences gathered from the investigation are new and significant, and should receive careful study by anyone who an investigator should consider.

1. Witness indicates that the object was in view only a second or so, but the observer, as the investigator points out, had the capacity of estimating time accurately.

2. The witness reports spend many times that of sound, but reports that the object was in view only momentarily, as the distance was far too remote for any accurate listening.

3. Many witnesses report that the object was viewed in a specific direction. The investigator should familiarize himself with the area, have measurements made, and determine the direction for himself.

4. The difficulty of the angles to be determined should be a warning. More people tend to overestimate angles, measured from the horizon, as to what he thinks is 45 degrees elevation.

5. Some witnesses may be either blind and others may have some mechanical or visual defect.

6. Many witnesses are under some type of mental stress prior to experiencing sightings of UFO's. Careful interrogation will be required to determine the effect, if any, that the stress had on the witnessing.

7. Many witnesses have special qualifications, which should be checked. If the witness is scientifically trained, it is probably better to let him recount his observations, not cross-examine him against his recollections.

There are many more things which can be brought out regarding investigation techniques, but these mentioned above should receive careful study by anyone conducting investigations. Those incidents which do contain evidence need the most attention because of their importance. Lack of confidence in the witness should not be allowed to limit investigation because of the flourishes put on it by an over-imaginative witness.

Many of the incidents which occur each year and are reported as UFO's are observed by scientists in the areas in which the incidents occur.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads as follows:

Location of occurrence: Iayovtsingersts Should Check With local observers, Where exact location of sighting is not definitely known. Any known occurrence could account for the sighting.
Secrecy and necessity of information on the project in the local weather station at the time of observation. Careful study of the local weather station will reveal the reasons of observation for the sighting.
UFO reports should contain the best possible weather data. This data should not be obtained from the witness, but rather from the weather station closest to the site of the sighting which could have recorded significant data.

IV. Major Causes of UFO's and How to Identify Them

The attached chart is a breakdown of the sightings for the year 1960. This chart is typical of the last few years.

1. Meteors
The first type is METEORS reported most frequently as a UFO in the meteor. You are all familiar with the classical shooting stars and some of you may have been fortunate enough to witness a fireball which is a much larger meteor. Some of you may have seen rare trails left in the atmosphere a "Fibreball".

Here are the characteristics of this type of sighting:
a. The duration is USUALLY extremely short. Varying from a fraction of a second to several seconds.
b. The color may be red, white, green, blue-almost any color depending upon the chemical composition of the meteor.
c. The flight path will almost always be straight. Reports where the position of initial observation and the final position are noted indicate a straight line trajectory.
d. The speed, of course, will be associated with the size of the meteor. AS a rule of thumb, the speed may vary from 43.8 miles per second, depending upon whether the meteor is overcoming the Earth's gravity or merely passing it by.

- page 39 -

There is no photograph present in the image provided. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text found in the document is as follows:

As we night, Meteors have been observed during the day as well as at night. Trails of smoke have often been left during the day. But this is not always the case, the observers state.  

Bolides are a class of meteor that are either heard or seen to explode. If accompanied by sound, the sound may be likened to a "whoosh" or rumbling, humming or descriptive word that indicates the sound is distinctive, but does not resemble thunder.  

The sound may not always be associated with the bolide, and the observers decide to disregard the sound for the sighting. The sight alone may be used to classify the sighting.There are occasions when a change of direction may be noted for several of the bolides.

3. Stars and Planets

Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and even the moon and stars (under a variety of circumstances) have been reported as UFO's. Again it should be emphasized that the most frequent reports are of unidentified objects that have an extremely long duration with little motion. It is likely that the observers look for the object at the same time on succeeding nights. Reports of short duration do not seem to establish themselves as identifiable stars or planets.

4. Other Causes  

Ball lightning, mirages, parhelia and parasiolenes, and comets and aurora are some other phenomena which may be mistaken and reported as UFOs. These and certain other rare or unknown natural phenomena are often viewed under unusual circumstances and reported as an UFO.

With appreciation of the diligence and sincerity of the report, it is felt thaE these lights were probably related to known aircraft or astronomical phenomena, though the precise identification is not clear in this case. Particular factors probably contribute to the sightinEs that may not be readily apparent to the casual observer.

The document provides information and regulations regarding the Air Force's responsibilities for investigating and analyzing UFOs over the United States.

The text in the document reads as follows:

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO)

This regulation establishes the UFO Program to investigate and analyze UFO's over the United States. Such investigation and analysis is directly related to Air Force responsibilities for the detection of air defense enmities, the protection of national interests, and the discharge of other functions, including air rescue and air defense—detection, identification, interception, and destruction. All commanders will comply strictly with this regulation.

1. Explanation of Terms
2. Objectives: Air Force interest in UFO's is three-fold: First, as a possible threat to the security of the United States and its forces; second, scientific; and third, to fulfill the Air Defense Command's responsibility for the detection, identification, and destruction of airborne objects which could be hostile.

AFR 200-2
and, to determine the technical or scientific characteristics of any such (UFO) sightings, and to identify all UFO sightings as described in paragraph 3.
a. Air Defense. The great majority of flying objects reported have been caused by a variety of natural phenomena, including the sighting of astronomical objects, lights, and conventional aircraft of the United States and its possessions. However, determine the possibility exists that foreign powers may be hostile to the security interest of the United States and its possessions. It is consequently necessary to report all sightings of UFOs in order to determine their identity and take corrective action as possible.
b. Technical and Scientific. The Air Force will continue to collect and analyze reports of UFO sightings until all are scientifically explained or identified as something else. This task is of great importance as reports of UFO sightings have been exploited. In performing this task, the following factors are of great importance:
(1) To measure scientific advances, the Air Force must have the latest observations on new or unusual vehicles or weapons.
(2) The possibility exists that foreign countries may develop air vehicles or revolutionary military configurations or propulsion.
(3) There is need for further scientific knowledge of such fields as astronomy, aerodynamics, upper atmosphere, the study and analysis of UFOs and similar aerial phenomena.
(4) The reporting of all pertinent factors will have a direct bearing on scientific analyses and determination.
6. Reduction of Percentage of UFO's "Unknowns". Air Force activities reduce the percentage of unidentifieds to the minimum. Analysis has thus far "explained" all but a few of the sightings reported. These unexplained sightings are considered scientifically as "unknowns" and will be further analyzed and evaluated. However, the fact that these "unknowns" are limited in number compared with knowns had been available, probably these, too, could have been explained. However, because of limitations in our knowledge, observational data, and the fact that analyses of UFO sightings depend primarily on the personal impressions and interpretations of data or facts obtained under uncontrolled conditions, the elimination of all "unknowns" is probably not probable.
3. Responsibilities:
a. Reporting. Base commanders will report all information and evidence of UFO sightings, including information and evidence received from other services, Government agencies, and civilian observers. Governmental agencies and civil authorities will be advised of the fact that an investigation is being conducted. 
b. Investigation. Investigators are authorized to direct persons, including the investigators of the investigation area, to the Foreign Technology Division ( FTD) for the Air Force Systems Command, at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, telephone 3-7111, ext 69216/69375. The purpose of the calls is to report high priority findings. (See section c.)
c. Investigation. The commander of the Air Force area or agency in which the UFO sighting will conduct all investigation to submit a complete initial report of a UFO sighting. The initial investigation will determine the location, time, and other pertinent factors other than those closest to the scene of a reported UFO sighting will refer the sighting immediately to the commander of the area or agency. (See paragraph 5.)
d. Analysis. The Air Force Systems Command, Foreign Technology Division will analyze and evaluate:
(1) Information and evidence reported with the United States after the investigators have exhausted their efforts to identify the UFO.
(2) Information and evidence collected in EXCEPTION: The AFSFC (FTD), independent Air Force activities, may conduct any additional investigation or analyses to further or complete the findings.
e. Findings. AFSFC (FTD) will prepare a final report on each sighting after collection and analysis of data, and will forward a copy of the report to HQ USAF (AFCIN).
f. Public Relations and Information Services. The Office of Information Services will be responsible for releasing information on sightings, and, in coordination with the AFSFC (FTD), answering questions and releasing information to the public regarding UFOs. (See paragraphs 7 and 8.)
g. Congressional Inquiries. The Office of Legislative Liaison will:
(1) In coordination with the AFSFC (FTD) and/or the Office of Information, when necessary answer all congressional mail regarding UFO sightings.
(2) Forward these inquiries to the Secretary of the Air Force and Headquarters USAF.
(g) Forward those inquiries which are scientific and technical to the FTD for information on which to base a reply. The FTD will respond.
