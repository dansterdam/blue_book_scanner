The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text from the document:

At first it was a bright light. It was far away so it looked like a star. But then you got my binoculars and saw it clearly. It flew over the rooftops of right away. It moved the same way light moves, but it was bigger than a star. It would disappear for a little while and then come back. You couldn't really see it clearly. You could see a shape, but you couldn't make it out. It flew over the neighborhood and seemed to move all directions. This went on for quite a while. It flew over high and low and then finally disappeared.

Did the phenomenon move behind or in front of something, like a cloud, tree, or building at any time?

The image appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch of an object, possibly a UFO or some other aerial phenomenon. The sketch shows a curved, elongated shape with some additional markings or annotations around it. There is also some handwritten text describing the object and the observed characteristics.

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

"Started as a fight.

What was the angular size, hold a match at arm's length in front of a known object, such as a street lamp. Read the match, express in degrees, and perform this experiment at the time of the sighting. Estimate what fraction of the angular size of that known object was covered by the phenomenon.

DC was the size of a pin head without definitely bigger or smaller, then with the binoculars half half hollowed half at arms length."

- page 8 -

The image appears to contain a filled-out form from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The form includes several multiple-choice questions related to the observation of a UFO phenomenon. 

The handwritten responses on the form indicate that the observer described the UFO as resembling a "miniature ship with a glowing edge", and that they did not notice any sound, odor, or heat emanating from the phenomenon. Additionally, the observer did not notice any physical evidence or disturbance to the ground from the UFO.

Rego Park, N.Y.
June 23, 1968

Dear Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.,

I am writing you about a U.F.O. incident that happened to me about 8 months ago. It was a clear day, bright and sunny. I was walking along my alley, when my attention was drawn to a bright shiny object in the sky. It was about 250 ft. in the air, and about 100 ft. away from me. It seemed to just hover there. I could not believe what I was seeing. There was one thing very strange, before it disappeared, it let out a large column of smoke. Would you please write me and tell me what this thing is. Thank You. 

Sincerely yours,

The text in the document is as follows:

JUN 27 1968

Dear Mr. -----,

This will reply to your letter of June 23, 1968, in which you described your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation to what you saw. However, if you will complete the attached questionnaire and mail it in the enclosed envelope, our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate further and make an evaluation.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base has a UFO investigator who is better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify the sighting yourself by looking at the categories of objects often reported as UFO's in the Project Blue Book report we sent you on June 20, 1968.

Dear Project Blue Book:
I have sighted a U.F.O.! Don't tell anybody about this. I just wanted to run it through my file. Here are the details:
Time: 7:20 to 9:00 - 1:40. 
These were things were seen circling Rego Park, and seemed to be under intelligent control. They changed direction several times. It was a strange sight! There was a halo around each of the objects.
There were at least 10, possibly more.
The night was clear and the moon was bright.
Please let me know if there is any information you can add to this report.
Thanking you in advance.

"SAF-OIGG/Miss Turnure/76526/June 25, 1968

JUN 251960

Dear Mr. (name redacted),

This is in reply to your letter dated January 22, 1968, in which you recommended that orders be issued to shoot down any unidentified flying objects (UFO) that would not communicate.

We must decline to follow your recommendation for a number of reasons. First, the sighting of unidentified flying objects have been determined to be natural objects such as stars, meteors, satellites, and balloons; it would be unwise to shoot down these natural aerial phenomena. Secondly, there are several categories and no useful purpose would be served by shooting at the fourth category. In addition, civilian aircraft sometimes report sightings as "UFO's". Often these planes carry no radios, and if one were shot down, it would be a serious and unfortunate incident. Furthermore, as you know, the Air Force continues to extend an open invitation to anyone who claims to have evidence or information concerning UFO's to submit his evidence for analysis; so far, no one has done so.

Dear Project Blue Book,
I want to thank you for sending me the information on U.F.O.'s. I think we are wasting our time to send the Air Force letters. The reason is because of the U.F.O. sightings near the Air Force bases. These creatures may be planning to attack us right now.
I think the reason for all these sightings is because the creatures want to find out about our Defense System. Also if their ships can fly like we are told, then they could demolish us. So I think we should act now and put out an order to shoot any U.F.O. which will not communicate. I hope you will take this theory seriously.
I will expect an answer. Thank you.

It appears to be a letter from the Department of the Air Force dated June 20, 1968, addressed to a Mr. from the Chief of the Civil Branch, Community Relations Division, Office of Information. The letter responds to the recipient's recent letter concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The Air Force states that without essential information such as detailed flight characteristics, angular velocities, or weather information, they are unable to identify the UFO observation. However, they have included a Project Blue Book report which may be helpful in identifying the observation. The letter concludes by thanking the recipient for reporting the observation to the Air Force.

Dear Mr. _____,

This replies to your recent letter concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without essential information, such as detailed flight characteristics, angular velocities, or weather information, we are unable to undertake a scientific investigation. And you contacted the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately, an on-the-spot investigation would have been possible.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help to you in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Rego Park, N.Y.
June 16, 1968

Dear Project Blue Book,
I am writing you this letter because of my many sightings of U.F.O. Here is a brief description of my encounter with a U.F.O.: I was walking along my alley on a Sunday, when all of a sudden I saw what appeared to be a saucer. I stared at it for about 5 minutes. I estimate its height at about 250 feet in the air. It was about 150 to 200 feet away. I knew it couldn't be a jet or a plane, because of the way it flew. It was traveling at about 75 m.p.h. Also there was another strange thing about the saucer. It let out a thick cloud of smoke at just before it disappeared. It disappeared from sight in a instant. It also made no noise whatsoever. I hope you will give this incident a clear thinking over. Also if you find the time, to write me a letter giving me some possibilities on my incident. Also there were no witnesses except myself. Thank You.

Sincerely yours,
