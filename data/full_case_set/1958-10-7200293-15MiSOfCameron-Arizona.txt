The image contains a photograph of a man, which appears to be a portrait of an individual associated with the "UFO Buzzes Train" incident described in the text. The text provides details about the incident, including that the crew of Monon No. 91 had a "strange company" on their way to Indianapolis, which the text describes as four "companionable, curious UFO's."

Transcription of the text in the document:

WITNESSES IN Danville, Ill., saw the three to five objects in the sky at Monon, Ind. as they were moving in the same direction, occasionally to dart away in a different direction.

As Monon No. 91, a northbound freight, was passing Dillon's Crossing, the engineer and fireman saw four strange lighted objects in the sky just ahead of the locomotive. At first they thought they were airplanes, but soon realized they were not. As the train approached the lights they seemed to gather together, and then darted away, singly, and at high speed. This happened several times as the train went on to Indianapolis. The crew believes these were unconventional flying objects. However, the Air Force said they were not surprised and that these were probably reflections from the locomotive headlight. Other people in the area also witnessed the strange phenomenon.

UFO BUZZES TRAIN
about have touched close to so they on them they didn't come in close any more. While we were switching at Frankfort they stayed away back up the tracks, just hovered there, until we moved on. Then they followed us again. When they finally went away at Kirklin they just zipped off to the northeast and kept on going and we didn't see them anymore.

It was an astounding experience the train crew of Union Number 80 had undergone during that harrowing hour and to minutes as the freight lumbered across the Hoosier prairie, and it was all the more astonishing for the annals of such things, far its duration and because the objects gave evidence of intelligent control by dodging away from the trains.

The television interview with Cecil Leeland and Edward Robinson got on the newswires that same day, of Lafayette, the Bunker Hill AF base had installation a special line to contact the base at once should such objects again appear. According to officials of the Monon at Lafayette, the Bunker Hill AF base has installed a special line to be contacted if similar objects in the future.

UFOS SERIOUS BUSINESS  
(Excerpt from statement issued by the License Department, December 24, 1959)

Unidentified flying objects - sometimes treated lightly by the press and referred to as "flying saucers" - must be rapidly and accurately identified as serious USAF business in the "zone of interior." As AFR 200-2 points out, the Air Force concern with these sightings is threefold: First of all, is the object a threat to the defense of the U.S.? Secondly, does it contribute to technical or scientific knowledge? And then there's the inherent USAF responsibility to explain to the American people through public information media what is going on in their skies.  The phenomena or actual objects comprising UFO's will tend to increase, with the public more aware of goings on in space but still inclined to some apprehension. Technical and defense considerations will continue to exist in this area. What is required is that every UFO sighting be investigated and reported to the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson AFB and that this explanation to the public be realistic and knowledgeable.

"They lit up twice like I told you. They did that twice as they went and the color changed. When the first lit up they were bright white, then they changed to a kind of yellow, then to orange when they went real slow."

"Robinson agreed with this description. He added that he had seen them from the back end of the train for several minutes after they went away to the east and then they went away."

Three men surgeons from nearby River Edge went out on the night of UFO observation according to their testimony, they were watching a strange light in the sky and they decided to follow it in car. After that, the UFO left no vapor trails. Also, they were going to the speed of the Jet which was formerly on the screen of the jet and were in formation. They remained in sight for two minutes...

LANDING IN KENTUCKY 
A saucer shaped object landed in a rural area near Stephensburg, Kentucky. The object was reported by a Mrs. James E. Goad, who, with her husband, was passing the area. She saw a bright, metallic object sitting in a nearby field. She thought it had crashed, so she stopped and called her husband to investigate. He approached the object and after examining it for about 10-15 minutes, he called a neighbor to come and see it. The neighbor arrived and together they walked around the object. The object suddenly took off at a high rate of speed, straight up, with a "whirring" sound. After leaving the ground, the object hovered for a few seconds, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight. The witness stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape, looking much like an ice cream cone. According to the witness, it was about 30 feet in diameter and 12-15 feet in height. It was smooth and highly polished in appearance. After leaving the ground, the object hovered over the field for another 45 minutes. It then moved away at a high rate of speed, disappearing from sight. No unusual odor or radiation was detected at the landing site. The ground where the object had rested showed slight grass indentations and traces of an oily substance that had dried up. An investigator was unable to find any other evidence at the site.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY) 
Source: Space Craft Diegs, Fall 1958

TWO HUNTERS SEE ERIE SKY LIGHTS
The two hunters were hunting for elk in the mountains near Mount Cameron, Oregon, on the night of October 7, 1958 around 3 a.m. Tuesday morning. For about 20 minutes, as they were hunting for a campsite, a white and red light seemed to keep pace with them, hovering over a mountain or a camp fire.

Then the light, alternately bright and dim, sped toward the car, suddenly halting and nearing the ground to the right and slightly ahead of them. As the ground became illuminated, the lights went out.

Both men said the white light was the most brilliant with the red light beneath it.

They refused to remain in the area and returned to Sisters. There, they said, a wildlife inspector reported other groups had also seen the lights in the same general area. Bob Brant is employed by Southern Pacific R.R. and his brother is home on leave from the AIR FORCE.

Both said that they considered reporting the event to the state police, but did not because they thought the police would not believe them.

Gentlemen:

Please refer to my letter of January 25, 1950.

On January 25, 1950, I requested News Release No. 62-59 of January 22, this year, concerning the Air Force UFO Study. This is not, of course, an enquiry to which I requested specific information, repeated as follows for your conveniences:

"I would greatly appreciate the completion of the basic details concerning these two cases that were considered 'unknown.'"
Various papers in Indiana carried an extremely interesting UFO observation made in the early morning hours of October 3, 1959, by the crew man of freight train No. 1 - the Moon Railroad. They reported the sighting of a strange object as having crossed the tracks just ahead of the train. What was the conclusion for this case??"

I would appreciate having a definite answer to my questions.

Congress, including Senator Lyndon Johnson, whose attention has already been called to this matter.

Very truly yours,
