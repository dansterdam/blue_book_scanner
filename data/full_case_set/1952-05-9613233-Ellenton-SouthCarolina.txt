Unidentified Objects Sighted by Four Employees of the DuPont Company, Savannah River Plant, Ellenton, S.C., at 2315 Hours on 4 May 1952.
Documents and Dissemination Branch Collection, DID, Dir. of Intelligence, DCS/O, Gen., Code 192, R-110.
1. On 14 May 1952, the Federal Bureau of Investigation telephonically furnished the following information in regard to the above subject:
RAB, approximately 2305 hours, 4 May 1952, four (4) employees of the DuPont Company, employed at the Savannah River Plant, Ellenton, South Carolina, saw four similar objects approach from the south and disappear in a northerly direction.
At approximately 2310 hours, the same employees saw similar objects approach from the northeast and disappear in a southwesterly direction. On one of the objects a slight trail was observed about 200 yards in length.
"The eighth object approached the 4.40 area from northeast, was traveling at an altitude so low it had to rise to pass over some tall tanks in 4.40 area." This object was also visible climbing at a high rate of speed.
Witnesses stated that they observed objects wearing from left to right, and seemed to hold general courses, due to speed and altitude, they were only visible for a few seconds.
2. The Atomic Energy Commission has furnished the foregoing information by the FBI. The information was released that the matter was definitely determined not to be aircraft from the Savannah River Plant.
3. The foregoing information was telephonically furnished to Major Roerum of your Directorate on 15 May 1952.

SPECIAL INQUIRY

TO: Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters, USAF
Washington 25, D. C.

1. SYNOPSIS: Information received from Augusta Office that 
four individuals had sighted four disc-shaped objects at 2340 
hours, 10 May 1952, while working at the DuPont Savannah River Project 
across the Savannah River, Augusta, Georgia.

2. DETAILS: FBI advised that four individuals observed 
four disc-shaped objects at 2340 hours, 10 May 1952, approaching from 
the south and moving in a northerly direction while working at the DuPont 
Savannah River Project across the Savannah River, Augusta, Georgia. 
Approximately 10 minutes the objects were observed coming from the north 
moving in a southerly direction. Approximately 10 minutes later the objects 
were observed going from south to north. These individuals described the 
discs as being about 15 inches in diameter to the naked eye, with a yellow 
or white color, and flying at a very high altitude (no exact estimate
given). According to the individuals, the discs appeared to be traveling
at a high rate of speed and could only be observed for a few seconds.

as the individuals observed the discs can't be identified from the minute 
description on the report.

In re: blue-green light over Portland, Oregon
10:15 to 10:30 p.m., May 10, 1952
Dear Sirs:
Last night I observed a peculiar celestial phenomenon, to which I attached little significance when I heard radio reports of a "meteorite" explosion over Seattle, feeling that it might be of some value, however minute, to you if an reporting it as briefly as possible.
On the night of April 10, 1952 at 10:15 P.M. I observed a light with a bluish tinge shining through the thin strata of clouds in the northeast section of the sky up to 30 degrees above the horizon; it appeared as a short streak, rather than a single spot, possibly due to diffraction of the cloud layers. It intermittently was about that of a search-light shining on the clouds but different in three ways from the reflection of a searchlight: (1) It was more diffused. (2) It had a pulsating quality, appearing and disappearing at intervals. (3) It appeared as a short straight bar rather than as a circular spot as some search-lights previously observed in this area by me.
After watching it for some five minutes from our yard I called my wife to observe it and she joined me in trying to trace its course. She told me it was somewhat fainter.
We watched it until 10:30 and then went in doors. At about 10:40 or 10:45 P.M. we looked for it again but the light had vanished from the sky and we had the clouds in the same position as originally observed there was no moon in that section of the sky either. When I first noticed this peculiar light through the clouds I had thought briefly that it might be a searchlight from one of the many war plants in this area, but there when the clouds had moved away ten minutes later, I concluded that
it was not the moon.
This observation may be meaningless but I send it to you for whatever value it may have.
Yours truly,
L.G.C./WW

DATE: 13 JUNE 1952
12. Extracted from FEAF "Interim" #717, dtd 0620/t, 13 June 1952:
Enemy balloons: Recently several reports have been received concerning the sighting of an unidentified object having a primary color of white changing to red, then one [one] is silver, and they are located at an altitude between 10,000 and 20,000 feet. On 15 May between the hours of 2102/I and 2206/I several were sighted and observed as being off-shaped or round, at an altitude estimated between 10,000 ft. and 16,000 feet, and in one case it was reported to have parked vertically for a distance. This movement was observed through a battery commander's scope and measured for 10 miles of travel. On the occasion when the objects were seen and observed, ground control was informed but the Air Technical Intelligence specialist and an ordnance Technical Intelligence specialist at OGII 55/1 June and saw a balloon being raised and lowered on a cable. Some of the previous sightings of unidentified objects have occurred in the same general area and the suspected for [for] a free balloon. The purpose of raising and lowering a balloon so near the front lines is not apparent, but could possibly be a method of communication.

REPORT TO CIVILIAN DEFENSE INVESTIGATORS

Subject: Object seen and photographed by [redacted] (12 years old) in the early afternoon of Sunday, May 4, 1952.

While playing in his backyard at [redacted] in San Francisco, California on the afternoon of Sunday, May 4, 1952, the witness reported he saw a whitish-orange object, which could have been round but from the distance appeared to be oblong, descending rapidly from the sky and stop stationary over the house. He saw the sky and a few stationary trees for comparison and is certain this object is not found among them. He was very excited about this and how this object did not move further except to flicker briefly. 

With great presence of mind he ran into the house and grabbed his Brownie camera. As he came out the object was still there and he snapped a picture of it. The object then changed its attitude and started to rise, eventually disappearing from sight.

He told the kids in his classroom about it, and took a lot of kidding, and everyone told him nothing would show up on the film when developed. However, he was sure of what he had seen and was delighted when the film was developed, as the object showed up on the photograph, which is a faint but definite object of unusual appearance.

We are indebted to Mrs. [redacted], the witness's teacher, for the information leading to this report.

Submitted,

[Redacted]
