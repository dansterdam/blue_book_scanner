The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of the observed object, which appears to be two distinct light sources moving together. The sketch shows the object's movement as a "brighter light went up & down" and "a darker light went up & down" together.

Project Blue Book 1966-06-8277432-Medway-Ohio.pdf4.txt:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Bright light went straight up.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what:
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what:
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound None, b. Color The color was the same as the tight light, the red light.
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? Approx. 1/4 or less.
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing a series of questions and answers.

20. Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object? (Circle One) Yes No
IF you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate? The object was travelling at a high rate of speed, apparently a little more than normal aircraft in the area.

24.1 What direction were you moving? (Circle One) 
a. North b. Northeast c. East d. Southeast e. South f. Southwest g. West h. Northwest

g. Other: By looking out the open window of my car

26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects, which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
The object appeared as a bright light with a shimmering tail, traveling at a high rate of speed compared to normal aircraft in the area. It was difficult to determine the exact size or shape of the object due to the distance and speed. However, it did not appear to be a typical aircraft or known celestial object.

The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The text reads:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction the object was traveling, and a "B" on the compass to show the direction the object was traveling when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show that they were traveling.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing handwritten text.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: July 12, 1966
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire: When the object appeared over the field and headed down our direction, I thought it was coming our direction & would land in the field. The pulled up sharply as if flipping over & went out, was permanently fixed light on a field pole - we decided to drive closer
We were impressed with the intensity of the light and more the way it flipped over sharply and went out, suddenly veering off, than the fact that it was present. Its sudden veering to the right and quick disappearance, the fact that the bright light that came up and down seemed to be a permanent field light on a pole that the object had passed, and that it had flipped over sharply rather than just flying off, all impressed us greatly.
