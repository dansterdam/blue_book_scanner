- page 11 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a report or document, containing handwritten text describing an observation.

31 August 1966
Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

In galation number 19, the "triangle" is either a light on the object or the object lit itself. The "triangle" effect was probably caused by an atmospheric distortion, indicating it was rather high up. It often happens through a telescope when you look through a telescope.

- page 12 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten note or observation about a sighting of an unidentified object that went "133Â° of sky" in 4 1/2 minutes, and the observer notes that it was "possibly slower or faster than 200 MPH".

The text in the image is:

The object went 133Â° of sky 
in 4 1/2 minutes
#2c) Possibly slower or faster than 200 MPH
