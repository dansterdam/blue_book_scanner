10. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING
A series of lights in V formation. The lights were blinking 2 blocks of 3 at a time, giving the appearance of 6 lights blinking alternately. The lights then remained steady for about 2 hrs. and then went out. The lights were low on the horizon and appeared to remain at about the same position during the sighting.
11. COMMENTS
The lights had the appearance of being very high up and appeared to be a solid formation. His first impression was that the lights were a formation of aircraft which had their landing lights on. However, the duration of the sighting and the fact that the lights remained in the same relative position seemed to indicate that this was unlikely. His impression was that the formation was a rather high altitude and that the lights were probably not aircraft.

TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

On the 22 February 1958, around 8:30 p.m. eastern standard time, I was walking by my house after having had a few drinks, and I observed in the sky three lights which appeared to be moving quite fast. These lights appeared to be very high up, maybe 20,000 feet or more. They were moving in a southerly direction from my location. I watched them for five to ten minutes, and then they disappeared over the horizon.

Later on, at approximately 9:00 o'clock that night, I was in my house and noticed the moon in the sky. It was about a two-thirds phase. I went to the door to take a look and noticed that there was a group of lights flying about. They would stop, hover for a while, and then move off again. All this is very strange to me, because I have no way of really knowing how high they were or the speed at which they were traveling. Rather than being a source of light, they appeared to be emitting light. At first, I paid little attention to them, thinking that they might be a group of planes flying along a common course, but after watching them for some time, I decided that they were not like any planes I have ever seen before. They would normally follow a straight line, and then all of a sudden, they would move down sideways. This action was very strange to me. I then passed it off from my mind.

I did not see them again.

Text extracted from the document:

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
ORIGINATING AGENCY: DEPT AS 39, Virginia
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, Hampton, Virginia, 25 February 1958
The following report is submitted in accordance with the requirements of AFR 200-2. This incident was investigated by the Langley Air Force Base Operations.
A. Description of the Object:
(1) Shape: Circular sources of light.
(2) The size was estimated to be slightly smaller than a dime held at arm's length.
(3) Color was white tinged with yellow.
(4) Approximately seven light sources were observed.
(5) The lights were observed to be in a rough "V" formation or about a 120° angle.
(6) No features or details were discernable.
(7) No tail, trail, or exhaust was observed.
B. Observer's reported no found. He had specifically indicated that anything moving that fast would undoubtedly be as an apparent speed. This was only unusual features of the sightings seemed to be the apparent speed which was estimated to be approximately 600 to 800 knots. In both of these sightings the apparent speed was approximately the same. No other details could be ascertained during this observation. As the information of the source seemed to move or oscillate within the time of observation, it was judged that this movement was more rapid than the observer could accurately determine. He further stated that the sources seemed to move or oscillate with a comparatively steady course.
C. Description of Course or Objects:
(1) Attention of the observer was called to the objects by the violent motion.
(2) When first observed on the first sighting, the lights appeared to be directly overhead when first observed. During the second sighting the lights appeared to move from overhead slightly to the side.
(3) The lights seemed to enter the area and then disappeared or simply vanished from sight in a rather rapid manner.
