Indicated Sighting of Unidentified Flying Object
Time: Wednesday - 5/23/62 - 10:30 PM 
Place: SW of Cleveland, Ohio
Course of Object: Approx 8 miles, took about 5-10 minutes in crossing sky. 
Estimated speed: 5,000 - 8,000 feet per second.
Maneuver: Slight clouds, generally sunny, clear, little wind.

Details of Sighting:
I was driving north on Route 20, 50 - 53 MPH - windows open - looked across my dash and away from the direction I was traveling. I saw a bright light, approximately 10 o'clock, moving in a straight line across my path. The time I observed the object was from 2-3 minutes. The object was visible in the distance for an additional 2-3 minutes. The shape of the object could not be determined, but was surrounded by a bright white light. Upon looking back, the object had disappeared into the distance, estimating its overall distance to be 5-8 miles. The object showed no signs of sound or exhaust smoke, or contrails. The altitude and distance of the object could not be determined accurately, but was estimated to be a considerable distance.

Shape of Object: Ellipsoid - no visible openings or wings. Appeared smooth, but unable to confirm.

Field engineer for an aircraft manufacturer - qualified in all aircraft, military and civilian - several hours observed. Seems to be a case worthy of further consideration.
