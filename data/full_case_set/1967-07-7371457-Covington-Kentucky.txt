Transcribing the text from the document:

HAD JUST LEFT MY GRANDPARENTS WHO LIVE ON A FARM AND I MUST LOOK AT THE STARS FOR A FEW MOMENTS, AND A THING APPEARED IN THE SKY FOR A FEW MINUTES AND HAVE YELLOWISH OR REDDISH COLORS, AND WE NOTICED IT TO BE A PLANE IN THE WESTERN SKY NEAR HORIZON. IT WAS ABOUT 15 MINUTES BUT AS I WANT TO SEE THE PLANET WE HAD JUST BEEN WATCHING COME OUT I DID NOT PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO IT. AS I WAS LOOKING HIGH IN THE SKY SOMETHING MOVING THROUGH THE SKY AND I WILL REMEMBER IT AS LONG AS I LIVE. SUDDENLY THIS MAY BE AN ILLUSION SOMETHING ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE FEET LONG AND MAY BE ABOUT TWO FEET WIDE AND AS NEAR AS I CAN REMEMBER IT WAS WHITE AS NEAR AS I CAN REMEMBER AND MAY HAVE BEEN ASTRAY FROM ANOTHER PLANET AND AVERAGE SIZE THAT IS SO SMALL IT WOULD NOT HAVE NOTICED IF IT HAD NOT MOVED. HOWEVER, IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT A REFLECTION IN ANY WAY. LET ANYONE WAGERING MY HEAT GENTLY TO CATCH THE STAR, OF COURSE WAS UNABLE TO DO SO, BUT I WAS OBSERVING IT CLOSELY AND THOUGHT IT APPEARED TO GO OUT LIKE BLOWING OUT A CANDLE AND DISAPPEARED BEFORE MY EYES.

Air Force UFO form continued
MUCH LOWER IN ALTITUDE THAN A VERY FAST OBJECT WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED BEFORE. I SEEMED TO BE UP AND DOWN LIKE A DIVING OBJECT. IT WAS A VERY FAST OBJECT AND I COULD NOT ACTUALLY DETERMINE HOW BIG IT WAS - ONLY THAT IT SEEMED VERY SMALL, LIKE AN AIRPLANE IN THE DISTANCE. THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW CLOSE IT ACTUALLY WAS. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 20 MILES AWAY OR JUST A FEW HUNDRED YARDS. I THINK A RADAR MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE ITS DISTANCE AND SPEED BUT OUR EQUIPMENT IS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE.
SOME TIME ago I DID SEE AN OBJECT THAT SEEMED TO BE MUCH SLOWER AND WAS A VERY BRIGHT GREEN. IT CAME DOWN VERY CLOSE AND THEN ZOOMED UP STRAIGHT INTO THE CLOUDS. IT SEEMED TO BE A SOLID OBJECT AND I COULD ALMOST MAKE OUT A DEFINITE SHAPE, BUT I COULDN'T DESCRIBE IT IN DETAIL.
JUST A SHORT REPORT ON THIS LATEST SIGHTING. I REALLY COULDN'T SAY WHAT IT WAS, BUT IT SURE MOVED WITH TERRIFIC SPEED.

Transcription of the handwritten text:

9:15 p.m. - Witness, 30 year old male, was traveling west on I-75 in his automobile when he noticed an object about 300 yards away in the sky. The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and shaped like a disc. The object had a red light on top and a green light on the bottom. The witness stated that the object made no noise and was hovering about 500 feet above the ground. The object remained stationary for about 30 seconds, then accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The witness did not hear any noise or see any flames or exhaust from the object. He estimated the speed of the object to be approximately 1000 mph. The witness immediately pulled his car off the road to investigate the sighting further, but the object had already disappeared. He did not observe any other vehicles or persons in the area at the time of the sighting. The witness stated that he could not offer any rational explanation for what he had observed.

TDA

On 13 July the Detroit News carried an article on an object which the dimensions are as follows: 2' wide x 1 1/2' high x 2" thick. The object was a black band. One half of the item was window made of plexiglass surrounded by aluminum. 
The calling signal indicates APA, TC, Cinnamon, Michigan, and others.
Major Ward, who is the OD relative to UFOB, (AD-33-11570-3115)
I relayed to him our interest in the object, and requested that he contact Mr. Ralph Riley (313-222-2142) of the Detroit News, who now has physical possession of the item, and do the following:
a. Secure or take photos of the item for shipment to us.
b. Ascertain the nature of the item.
c. Assure the item if it appeared to be foreign in nature.

On 24 July, I called Major Ward, and he said that an investigation was made on our behalf, and that the object was an escape hatch from a private airplane, probably of North American manufacture. Major Ward is sending us a copy of the photographs as info, and will contact the FAA in that area to lend his assistance in the case. These photos will be examined upon arrival and then sent to FDTI/TF for their information.

COVINGTON, KENTUCKY
July 7, 1967
SUBJECT: UNEXPLAINED AERIAL SIGHTING
1. At approximately 2230 hours on 7 July 1967, Mrs. XXXXX (address deleted), Covington, Kentucky, telephoned the Kentucky National Guard Armory, Covington, and reported an unexplained aerial sighting.
2. Mrs. XXXXX stated that she had observed an object in the sky over Covington which she could not identify. She described the object as being elliptical in shape and of a bluish-green color. Mrs. XXXXX said the object appeared to be hovering or stationary in the sky and estimated that it was at an altitude of about 300 to 500 feet. She stated that the object was visible for approximately two to three minutes before it suddenly disappeared.
3. The Kentucky National Guard was notified of Mrs. XXXXX's report. No other sightings of the object were reported by other individuals in the Covington area.

The image appears to show a black and white photograph of a rear-view mirror or side mirror of a vehicle. The mirror has a distinctive curved shape and appears to have some distortion or blemishes on the surface. There is no human face or other identifying features visible in this image.

SUBJECT: UNKNOWN OBJECT 
DATE: 7-7-67
LOCATION: COVINGTON, KENTUCKY
INVESTIGATOR: JGS 
DESCRIPTION: The witness, Mr. Covington, stated that while driving his car on the highway, he noticed a bright object in the sky which he thought at first was a plane. As the object came closer, however, he realized it was not a plane and pulled over to watch it.

The object appeared to be circular in shape and was colored reddish-orange. It moved slowly across the sky for several minutes before disappearing in the distance. Mr. Covington stated that he did not feel frightened during the observation, but was very puzzled by what he had seen.

The witness could not provide any photographs or physical evidence of the sighting.

Dear Sirs:
On Aug. 19, 1967, my cousin and I saw a bright red light moving in the sky about 10:40 p.m. CST. It seemed to be coming from the direction of the Covington area across the Ohio River and was traveling in a northeasterly direction. The light became bright and then dimmed several times during the approximately 2 to 3 minutes that we observed it. When the light finally dimmed out of sight, there was no sound and no trail. We believe it may have been an aircraft or a satellite, but it moved much more rapidly than any aircraft we have ever seen. If any additional information is required, please let me know.
Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]

Dear Sir

About two weeks ago my neighbor and I saw a phenomenon. We both had a difficult time but there were no more than three or three and a half minutes. we called the other neighbors and two or three came back toward us. Soon after that it turned back and went up in the sky. It was a brilliant light and three or four times the size of the moon. It passed through that area and when it got up to the tree, it go out of sight.

I hope this will cast some light on it for you.

Sincerely
Arnold

AUG 14 1967
Proposed reply to letter from Barbara Goode, July 29, 1967 (Sighting Jul 1967)

Dear Mrs.
Reference your recent letter in which you reported your unidentified
observation.

It would be extremely difficult to perform a comprehensive investigation based on your observation; you neglected to mention the time, date and location of your sighting. If you would report your sighting to your nearest military installation (if your sighting occurred in the United States) at the time, our analysts and evaluators would have attempted to determine what you had observed. If we had been unable to find a logical answer, then your case would have been categorized as UNIDENTIFIED.

You did not mention whether your observation occurred in the United States or Canada. The United States Air Force lacks jurisdiction to investigate these sightings outside its continental limits. In the future, if you should observe another UFO, please contact your nearest military installation; for the local investigator is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

The enclosed information on Project Blue Book may be of interest to you and your husband. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Report of strange object seen by myself and others. Object seen over northern Kentucky on night of 6-25-67 approx. 8:45 p.m. Object was hovering, moved erraticly, and made no noise. Object appeared much larger than airliner. I reported this immediately to AF duty officer at Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? Day Month Year
July 7, 1967

- page 63 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten report or document from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

The information which you have submitted deals with an unidentified aerial object which was observed on 9 June, 1967 near Covington, Kentucky.

The object was described as a round, lighted object which was brighter than the stars. It was very bright, and was observed for several minutes. The object changed direction and speed a number of times. It was not an airplane.

Most interesting (sic) and important point in this case is the fact that the object was observed at close range (25 yards) and was described as having a definite shape and color. Despite the close observation, no details of the object's construction were reported. Nor were there any landing traces or other physical evidence.

In view of the limited information available, I am unable to arrive at any definite conclusion regarding the nature of the observed object. The case is classified as unidentified.

Dear Mr. Wright:

Reference your letter of July 11 in which you described the various unidentified flying objects (UFOs) which you have been observing since December, 1966.

At this late date, we would be unable to undertake a meaningful scientific investigation of your earlier observations. However, if you would like us to investigate your letter and your earlier observations, please indicate this, and we shall be glad to take a detailed investigation into your observations.

In the interim, if you should sight any further unidentified flying objects, please contact the nearest military installation at the time of your observation. The UFO investigating agency at your nearest military installation will be happy to assist you in their continuing investigation.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.
Sincerely,

Proposed reply to letter from XXXXX, July 11, 1967 (Sighting#xx,xx7)

Dear Mr. XXXXX,

Reference your recent letter of July 11 in which you described the various unidentified flying objects which you have been observing since December 1966.  

At this late date, we would be unable to undertake a meaningful scientific investigation into your earlier observations.

If you would like us to investigate your latter sightings of July 4 and 7, 1967 we will need additional information. Upon completion of the enclosed PID Form 164, our analysis will undertake a detailed investigation into your observations.

In the future, if you should observe another unidentified flying object, please contact the nearest military installation at the time of your observation. The UFO investigator at your nearest military installation is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

Thank you for reporting your observations to the Air Force.

Project Blue Book
U.S.A.F.
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sirs,

Since December, 1966, I have witnessed four objects which I feel warrant attention as possible U.F.O.'s.

My first sighting occurred on Friday, December 9, 1966. At around 11:00 P.M. I glanced out the kitchen window and noticed a bright red and blinking light moving slowly from west to northwest. It was at a fairly low altitude and I don't feel qualified to estimate its speed, but it was smaller in appearance than a search light and brighter when the red light blinked on.

The second incident occurred a week later on December 16, 1966. At this time my wife and I observed the same type of object, only this time it was moving in the opposite direction, from northwest to southeast. The light was not as bright this time but still very noticeable. On this occasion we estimated the object's distance to be approximately 2 to 3 miles from our house. However, the thing's actual size is not easily determined.

The third time I saw the object was on June 16, 1967. This time it came from the northwest, climbed high in the sky, then descended behind the house. It apparently landed in a field between our house and the woods down.

It was silent and did not resemble any conventional aircraft that I have ever seen.
(Much aircraft passed over our houses) It was an elongated missile and no other were visible.  The object appeared intelligently controlled.
No one was home but myself at the time and when I called my mother she only listened. 
A rash of U. F. 0. sightings occurred in our area shortly afterward.
Sometime last spring and again on July 1957 at around 10:30 P. M. I witnessed a similar or the same objectappear apparently landing in the same area as this first sighting.
The last sighting occurred last Friday, July 7, 1957 at around 10:30 P. M. It was observed for another twenty minutes then it was either smaller or farther away. It was following the probable course of my first sighting.
My mother saw it also and we watched it for about five minutes. It was moving steadily. It both moved that it moved around slowly.
At first it moved at a moderate speed but

Text from the document:

"Then, spaced up suddenly and disappeared in the distance. It was a clear night and stars were visible. This was not a star, meteor, or aircraft.

All these sightings have much in common:

All four were similar on the same object.

All four were silent and did not resemble conventional aircraft or helicopters, but did seem to be intelligently controlled.

With the exception of the last sighting, the objects all followed approximately the same course and disappeared at approximately the same speed and all landed in approximately the same spot.

The last sighting was following the opposite course of the others (east instead of west) and appeared to be either smaller or farther away.

All were sighted between 10:15 P.M. and 11:15 P.M."

THIS IS IN REPLY TO YOUR CORRESPONDENCE ON AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFO) SIGHTING OF JULY 7, 1967.

WITH THE INFORMATION SUBMITTED, IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO OFFER MUCH IN THE WAY OF EXPLANATION. SUCH CASES MUST BE FILED AS UNIDENTIFIED, AS IN A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION. IF YOU HAD ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO FURNISH, YOUR CASE COULD BE FURTHER EVALUATED. AN INVESTIGATOR AT YOUR NEAREST MILITARY INSTALLATION IS IN A FAR BETTER POSITION TO CONDUCT SUCH AN INVESTIGATION. YOUR INTEREST IN OUR PROGRAM IS APPRECIATED.

Proposed reply to correspondence from[REDACTED] age 15 (sighting 7 Jul 67)

Dear [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your correspondence on an unidentified flying object sighting of July 7, 1967.

With the information submitted, it would be extremely difficult to offer much of an explanation. Essential data such as flight characteristics, maneuvers, and duration of sighting are quite important in the evaluation and possible explanation. If you had reported your observation to the nearest military installation at the time, an evaluation would have been possible. The UFO investigator at your nearest military installation is in a far better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Your information will be added to our present data base.

[REDACTED], Henderson, New York
