Sirs:

Enclosed is questionnaire, relative to my sighting of July 25, filled out to the best of my knowledge.

Attached are two additional reports of objects sighted by this writer since that date, both of which, I believe, merit further examination. Both are analogous to the meteor, but evidenced several anomalies strikingly peculiar to meteor phenomena. I have not made public the latter two summaries for personal reasons.

For many years I have studied the skies, and, have in the last eight months taken an avid interest in "Saucer" phenomena. It has become a part of my daily regimen to watch for these "freaks" --- a vigilance that has accounted for my three unusual sightings.

Although I have attempted to evaluate these sightings, I can only surmise as to their true identity. From the history of sightings made known to us I have personally concluded, the objects are controlled, artificial devices. If not a part of U.S. research, then surely they must be of extra-terrestrial origin.

Sincerely,

Cincinnati 27, Ohio

Unidentified aerial object sighted in western sky, from eastern portion of Cincinnati,
at 9:48 PM, Wednesday, August 13, 1952.

SITUATION:
Sitting on porch, alone, adjusting lounge chair. Looking up suddenly, sighted object soaring from huge treetop in the Northwest.

WEATHER:
Generally clear directly above point of vision. A slight vaporous haze in the South and extreme western portions. Humid.

DESCRIPTION:
size...
Strikingly large! An estimate: quarter size of a full moon.
shape...
Globular. Of clearly defined outline: posterior, the same, completely lacking in tapering effect, without luminescent, gaseous or scintillating trail. These were positive, clearly observed characteristics!
color...
Brilliant luminous white like “burning magnesium”, but not emitting a haze or scintilla. Near center of object was an inconstant dark or shaded portion with an observed tendency to flicker.
altitude...
Object approximately less than 5000 feet.
course...
Flying South in positive, direct course without traceable arc or trajectory.
speed...
Faster than jet plane, but appreciably slower than any previously observed meteor. Estimated, 1000 mph. Time lapse from point of vision to disappearance behind neighboring rooftop - 3 seconds.

OTHER CHARACTERISTICS:
No sound whatever. Object had an apparent spinning or whirling motion, but its course remained constant and stabilized, free of drag or wobble.

EVALUATION:
I am aware of, and, familiar with the popular Perseid meteor shower. I have observed countless meteors of this shower in years past (especially 1946), and, have observed numerous meteors this summer. None of these compares to the object cited in this report. During the same evening (Aug. 13) I sighted no other meteors from my point of vision. The clearly observed abnormal features of the object would not indicate a Perseid meteor.

Unidentified aerial object sighted in Eastern sky, from eastern portion of Cincinnati 
(Madison Place) at approximately 10:30 Saturday, August 16, 1952.

SITUATION: Sitting on porch, scanning skies. Sighted object cannonballing 
from apex of neighbor's roof.

WEATHER: Mostly clear with intermittent cloud masses. Humid.

DESCRIPTION:
   size: Large. An estimate: quarter size of a full moon.
   shape: Globular. Of clearly defined outline; posterior, the same, without luminescent, gaseous or scintillating trail.
   color: Brilliant luminous white; without aura, haze or scintilla. No shaded portion in center noted, as in August 13th sighting.
   altitude: Object approximately less than 5000 feet.
   course: Flying due North in positive direct course with a lifting tendency of 
approximately 20 degrees. At no time did the object fall in arc or 
trajectory.
   speed: Faster than any known jet plane, slower perceptably than the usual meteor. Time lapse from initial point of vision to sudden extinction: 
3 seconds.

OTHER CHARACTERISTICS: No sound whatever. No spinning motion perceptable. Object 
maintained steady course without diminishing in size or brilliance; 
then as controlled by switch, the light cut out instantaneously.

EVALUATION: First impression: a large meteor. Still not discounting the meteor 
theory in later evaluation, however there remain certain anomalous 
features, viz: 
(1) Its steady uplift in flight without trajectory 
(2) No luminescent trail
(3) Low altitude
(4) Its phenomenally sudden extinction!
