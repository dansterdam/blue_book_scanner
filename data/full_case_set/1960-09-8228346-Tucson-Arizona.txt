Extracting text from the document:

TUCSON, ARIZONA 9 SEPTEMBER 1960

Subject: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. At approximately 2015 hours on 8 September 1960, I observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over Tucson, Arizona. The object was moving rapidly in a northeasterly direction at an estimated altitude of approximately 20,000 feet. The object emitted a bright white light which appeared to be pulsing or blinking at irregular intervals. No other lights were visible on the object. The object was under observation for approximately 2 minutes before it disappeared from sight.

2. The weather at the time was clear with unlimited visibility. No aircraft or other objects were observed in the area at the same time as the unidentified flying object.

3. I am a private citizen and have no special training or background in the identification of aircraft or other objects in the sky. This is the first time I have observed an unidentified flying object.

4. Disposition: This report is being submitted for your information and any investigation you may deem appropriate.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document page from the Project Blue Book archives, specifically a report dated September 14, 1950 regarding a cylindrical UFO sighting in the Caribbean Sea. The text states that the UFO was observed by the crew and two officers on an American U.S. Orion Clipper.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old report document, possibly from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

Based on the OCR analysis, the text in the document is as follows:

PARKED SOME 50 FEET SOUTH SOUTHEAST, AT WHICH LOCATION WAS OBSERVED VISUALLY.
THE OBJECT APPEARED AS APPROX 20 FT IN LENGTH, SLIGHTLY CONICAL IN SHAPE, WITH DARK COLOR LIKE THAT OF ALUMINUM. IT APPEARED TO BE SURROUNDED BY A HALO OF IRIDESCENT LIGHT WHICH DID NOT ILLUMINATE THE AREA AROUND IT. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED IN ALTITUDE OF APPROX 1500 FT AND WAS HEADING IN A NORTH NORTHWESTERLY DIRECTION AT AN AVERAGE SPEED OF 70 MPH. IT WAS IN VIEW FOR APPROX 2-3 MINUTES. AT NO TIME WAS ANY SOUND HEARD.
A COMPUTED BACK BEARING PLACES THE LOCATION APPROX 1.2 AIR MILES SE OF OBSERVER'S POSITION. THE OBJECT, WHICH HAD NO DISCERNIBLE SHAPE OR OUTLINES, APPEARED SUDDENLY AND QUIETLY, APPEARING TO HAVE NO PRACTICAL PROPULSION. IT LEFT NO TRAIL OR VAPOR.
IT IS FELT HERE THAT NO ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN IN THIS CASE AND THAT NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED SINCE THERE IS NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF ANY KIND NOR APPARENTLY ANY LOGICAL REASON FOR CONCERN.
