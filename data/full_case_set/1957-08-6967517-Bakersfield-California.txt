Mr. [Redacted]
Bakersfield, California

Dear Mr. [Redacted]

Your letter of 12 September, addressed to the Department of the Army concerning a report of an unidentified aerial object, has been referred to the Air Force for review and comment.

A careful study of your report indicates that you observed a meteoric form of a meteorite, generally referred to as “bolides” or “fireballs”. Between the 9th and 13th of August the earth intersected a meteoric swarm called the Perseids. Past experience with meteoric swarms of this nature shows that a larger number of meteoroids, “shooting stars”, and fireballs are observed during this period.

Your description of the object is so similar to a description of these bodies given by a well known astronomer that a portion is given here:

"......majority of people never see one in their lifetime. Fireballs differ from ordinary meteors in that they appear like a magnesium flare hurtling through the lower atmosphere. They are extremely fiery greenish in color, but often have blue, yellow or orange tints intermixed. Unlike meteors which become visible and burn out at high altitudes, fireballs do not burn out in the air but generally persist until they crash to earth, sometimes breaking into smaller sections and an array of sparks before doing so..."

Your reporting of this incident to the authorities and the interest shown in the matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

[Signature block redacted]
