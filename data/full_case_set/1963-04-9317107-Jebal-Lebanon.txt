Text from the document:
JEBEL LEBANON
On the morning of 9 April 1963, at approximately 0630 hours, a round, metallic disc-shaped object was observed for about 1 minute near Jebel, Lebanon.
The object was described as being about 10 to 15 meters in diameter, silver in color, and making a humming sound. It was observed at an altitude of approximately 100 meters, and was moving in a northwesterly direction at a speed estimated to be about 300 to 400 km/h.
The object was observed by several local inhabitants who notified the Lebanese military authorities. No further details are available at this time.

The distance to the bottom of the craft was estimated to be a great distance.
The craft was about the size of a medium bomber and remained stationary for at least 3 minutes.
I was sorry to say that a good deal of the craft went behind some trees and I was unable to gain a better view of it."
