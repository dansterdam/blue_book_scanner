10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
This object was first sighted at approximately 2220 hrs and was observed for a period of approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The object appeared as a large, round, bright light, clearly different from the stars and planets in the sky at that time. The light remained stationary for the entire period of observation and appeared to make no movement. At one point, it appeared to dim slightly but then regained its original brilliance. The object was observed by several persons at the scene.
11. COMMENTS
This appears to be a report of an unusual aerial phenomenon. The witness account indicates that the observed object was not an ordinary celestial object such as a star or planet, and the fact that it remained stationary for an extended period of time suggests that it was not an aircraft. Further investigation would be required to determine the exact nature of the observed object.
