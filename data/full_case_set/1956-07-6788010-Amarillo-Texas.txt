AIR FORCE PLANE DOWNED BY UNIDENTIFIED
OBJECT
Case 170. In air over Piainview, Tex., July 23, 1956--The above
headline quoted from the Rocky Mountain Newso Denver, Golo.,
refers to an incident occurring in the nation's interior. The
report is as follows:
"A Hamilton AFB transport plane survived a good $1
contact due to landing safely with shreds of the elevator
section of the aircraft's tail assembly torn away. The plane
backed out following a mysterious mid-air incident that no
one else could substantiate. Shortly after the pilot had
taken off at 10:20 P.M., July 23rd, he noticed a light, and
then a loud bang, a severe vibration and we went into a very
st ep dive.
In Capt. Richard Miller's words: "As we pulled out of the
dive, the two crew members were scrambling to their parachutes,
believing it was certain death. We did manage to land, however,
although the entire port engine had ceased functioning because
the nose gear door was torn away forcing the propeller to hit
the ground. There was a loud explosion and we lost our entire
elevator control. We were just barely able to make it to the
landing field."
The Air Force reported that the object the pilot saw, just
before the incident, was about the size and shape of a medium
jet and the speed estimated was "in excess of 600 knots." The
pilot said it was like a flash as it passed him. The errant
plane, thanks to the skill of the pilot, landed at the Amarillo
Air Force Base without further damage or injury."

Continued on the reverse side, the document states:
"Col. Griffis will say that this incident is "down the CROP line,"
i.e. freak wind and Jet stream conditions were responsible. We will
await further evidence and assure the public that we are doing
everything possible to get complete data on this case,
"This case concerns the incident of the Air Force plane apparently
struck while in flight near Amarillo, Texas on July 23, 1956. It is the
opinion of Capt. Richard Marler that the incident was caused by some
object striking the aircraft, producing extensive damage to the tail
section which rendered the plane momentarily out of control. The pilot
noticed a bright light or object just prior to the incident, which
suggested the possibility of contact with some unidentified flying
object. However, the Air Force explanation is that the unusual
atmospheric conditions prevailing at the time, such as high winds and
turbulance aloft, may have been a contributing factor in the damage
to the aircraft. Capt. Marler's opinion is that the incident was
caused by contact with some unidentified aerial object."

San Joaquin Valley, California

Case 173, San Joaquin Valley, Cal., July 22, '56 - Said the Los Angeles appeared Aerial Survey Department (Authority: US Case 173). Two mysterious flying objects were reportedly seen in the San Joaquin Valley, California, about 6:45 p.m. on July 22, 1956. The objects were described as circular in shape, about the size of a quarter held at arm's length, and had a slight bluish-green coloration. They were observed for approximately two minutes by two men, both of whom are described as being reliable persons. The objects were first seen at about 6,000 feet altitude, then descended to about 4,000 feet, at which point they accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view in a westerly direction. The objects were watched for approximately five hours before they "vanished". (Data 1956)

Sierra, California

Case 17-A. Sierra Peaks, Cal. July 23, 1956 - Air Part and I were on a trip in the Sierra Nevada Mountains fishing for trout. On the morning of July 23, Miss Cook and I were camping out at Lake Majave in the same area that we had been fishing in the. Around 2:45 a.m. Miss Cook awakened me and pointed out a peculiar light in the sky to the east. It appeared to be 3-4 miles away and was approximately 3-4 miles in size. It remained stationary for the first 5-10 minutes then started to move to the northeast at a very rapid speed, accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight in a few seconds. Miss Cook and I were amazed at the performance of this object and after discussing it decided to report it to the nearest Air Force Base which was March AFB. We were assigned in the following manner: First the blue ball was noticed which faded into a red glow, then into a green light, then went out completely. The object appeared to be lighted from the inside giving the effect of transparency. When it accelerated the whole object glowed a brilliant white. It made no sound at all during the time we observed it.

CASE 190. Cleveland, Ohio, July 24, 1956 - 2:15 p.m. Two witnesses, Paul Turner and James Pryor, were in a car on Route 20, just west of Wakeman, Ohio, when they observed a silvery object in the sky to the north. It was flat, circular or elliptical in shape, approximately the size of a quarter held at arm's length. It did not appear again. Speed was stated as being approximately 700 - 800 mph. To the naked eye the object appeared to be blue-white in color and was very bright and shiny, reflecting the sun's rays. It was observed for approximately 7 seconds and disappeared through the clouds in a horizontal flight. The object was comparablt to the moon for size when first sighted. Minute later, a jet plane could be seen in the vicinity but was unrelated to the object observed. This case is evaluated as a good sighting, the witnesses being quite reliable and the observation being reasonably detailed.

Case 193, Provo, Utah, July 28, 1956 - We quote from the Reports of Director of Intelligence: "Reports of a fiery light and a blastoff at the crest of Mt. Timpanogos. Fireworks caused the light and blast. Search craft followed flight to mountain's crest, but found no traces of any objects." They said the fire lit the sky at the top of the mountain. One said it appeared to be a missile which crashed into the mountain. The search found no traces of the flaming object.

July 30, 1956 - We quote from The Saginaw News, in referring to this case: "Deputy Sheriff Earl N. Bird and Deputy Sheriff Louis Fadie reported seeing a luminous object about 500 ft. in the air traveling very fast. They said their car's lights dimmed momentarily when the object passed over them. The sheriff later said the object was a "brilliant light" between 8:25 and 9:35 p.m., moving in a zig-zag pattern. A deputy from Bay County, who was driving near the location, saw the object and said its "light was too large and seemed too fast to be an ordinary aircraft." The object was reported in Saginaw, Gratiot, Midland and Clare Counties. The Buick 4-90 cc reported the light shone "just like a Brock lamp flashlight." The object finally disappeared behind some trees.

REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF ATTACHED PHOTOGRAPH AND COPY OF REPORT:
A. Photographic examination discloses that the photo is not "doctored", and is not an emulsion flaw.
B. Purpose makes analysis somewhat difficult. In the opinion of this office, the photo is not a "hoax." The analysis is generally conductive to a conclusion that the object shown here appears to be similar to those left in the wake of disintegration.
C. Encountered by citizens, these lights are not characteristics of any fledgling characteristics. The reflection encountered was bright and flashing out.
Information available to this office indicates that the closest missile launching site is in Holloman, a distance of approximately 300 miles from Amarillo.
A. Bright object was observed by the observer was moving in an almost opposite direction from this and that the appearance of the craft should one to observe the observation.
B. Based on the data or the above, the following are submitted for consideration:
a. (1) Whether the missile assumption is valid.
(2) Any knowledge of missile firings, which could illuminate this unusual finding.
(3) Any knowledge of missile firings, which could illuminate this unusual finding.
b. "D-Data (1) Negative - it is insufficient to cause or identify as object.
(2) Definition data of the small (sampling missile) photographs, using characteristics of the camera equipment used).

PIXLEY, CALIFORNIA

COMMENTS REGARDING PIXLEY CASE

1. This Center has no report under that identification. 

2. Numerous alleged UFO sightings are reported directly to, or are collected exclusively by, unofficial UFO groups. The majority have periodic publications, usually a monthly paper, which describe the incidents.

Many UFO sightings are reported only to newspapers. Where such "sightings" are reported to the Air Force, an investigation is difficult or impossible to conduct directly. As a matter of policy, the Air Force cannot consider cases not officially reported to it, as we must confine our investigations to bona fide incidents.

6-8 weeks or months later, when conclusions are reached, information is no longer possible, the Air Force is often queried regarding the status or explanation of the incident.
