Following report is quoted in entirety from REAF Bonjour Courerena Dilly
Summary for 20 January 1952 and covering operations during the night of 29 -
30 January. At HOO0 7 one unidentified object was observed by the GFQ, loft
Rcamor end tail gunner of aircraft No. 7332 atG11-40; 0 The disc shaped
object, size estimated by observers as 3 ft. across, wen first observed
parallel on course, at 8 o'clock level, 8 distance from 829 unknown. This
object remained with the B-29 for approximately five minutes. The object
aporared at 8 o'clock lovejfejggjng away from 29- B-29 was at 22,500 ft.,
heading 274°, 148 knot ground speed.

At 8 2227/A one disc shaped was observed, by the left end tail gunners
objact
of aircraft #2242, at &10-®1®9 The unidentified object was observed shortly
before receiving flak. The object approached the 29 from between 8 and 9
o'clock level then withdrew and disanpeared at the same o'clock position.

The observers estimated the object to be approximately three feet across
when at its nearest point to the B-29. The object was observed for one minute
at which time the weather was CAVU. The object appeared to bs spinning and
a color resembling the sun.

    Comments by 98 Bomb 'Jing Inttlligence Officer:

 
Because of the unusual nature of this sighting as well ns the similar one reported above special effort Yns a1nde to elLLUnate all possible kno\lTl alternatives concerning the possibili t;l that this could have been a r1exiglass reflection. It is to be noted that two different crew members spotted the object from different positions at the same time. In regard to flek, flares, and rockets, crew members indicated then- fimO.iari ty with such objects. 
In all cases crew members were veterans of WW II combat cre1m1en, and had had several bonlbii missions in Korea. They stated very emphatically that the sightings noted above bore no resemblance vhatsoever to anything they had previously experienced; The possibility that such storios had been rorrlicated is believed to be obviated by the fact that the crews involved, from different squadronn, flew on different missions and were intorro6ated at widely separato tines (1 hour). In conclusion it is the opinion of thio officer that thooe sightings represent another example of new techniques flnd warfare under test by the enen,y.

Comlllent by D/I, FEAF Bomber Command:

It is assumed that there is still a real possibility t.'iat these phenomena m&y very well indicate the presence of new enemy flare devices, desp:i_te the unit intelligence officer's feelings that such possibilities are ruled out. Aside from that, it is worth rlentioning that the 98ttJing Co LI11Bnder v1as present during the i11terrogation, and warned the crov members as to their responsibilities in reporting such observations. Special report of unidentified flying objects vill be subnitted.
 
Vie, of utterlack of simil!'Jr observations in the past and no firm indications on which to base evaluation requests your comments in regard to above.

Subj is report on info on unidentified flying objects: (1) observed 1 globe shaped object with a slight tear drop effect noted on lower side. Estimated size to be 3 feet across then at its nearest point to B-29. The size was not definitely established as the distance from the observer was not known. The color of the object resembled the sun, a light source, and it occasionally changed to a bluish tint. The outer edge of the object appeared to be fuzzy and it seemed to have an internal churning movement like flame or fiery gases when it was at its nearest point to the B-29. The object was first observed parallel on course at a 8 o'clock lever, where it seemed to be about the size of a saucer, gradually becoming larger as it approached the B-29. It came in on the same level as the B-29 and remained in the same relative position to the B-29 for approximately 1 min and then receded on the same path, fading away in the distance.
(2) Sighted on Jan 29 13 21/2 for a period of approximately 1 min. (3) the left gunner and tail gunner observed the object without the use of any optical or electronic equipment. The B-29 was at 22257 feet and ground speed 125 knots. (4) the 2 observers were airborne on the B-29 in the crew positions of left gunner and tail gunner. Object was observed at 10 3/49 and level with the B-29. (5) the observers are veterans of world war 2 combat and have flown several combat missions over Korea and are thoroughly familiar with flak, tracers and rockets. The observers stated very emphatically that the object observed bore no resemblance whatsoever to anything they had previously seen. This sighting is almost the same as sighting reported in Nov 1951. This report came from a different squadron and interrogation was conducted at different times.

APPENDIX III

Korea - 29 January 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

On the night of 29 January 1952, 30 miles WSW of Wonsan, Korea, three members of a B-29 crew, the tail, left, and top gunner, observed a light orange colored sphere for a period of five minutes. The object was on a parallel course to the B-29 at 8 o'clock level. The color of the object was further described as being the color of the sun with an occasional bluish tint. The outer edge of the object appeared to be fuzzy and it seemed to have an internal churning movement like flames or fiery gases. The object closed in on the B-29 to an undetermined distance, and then faded away in the distance.

The aircraft was on a heading of 274°, was at 22,500 ft. altitude and was making a ground speed of 148 knots. The time of the sighting was 2300 local Korean time. The weather was CAVU.

At 2324, local Korean time, members of another B-29 crew observed an identical object near Sunchon. This object was observed for one minute. The observers were the left and tail gunners. In this instance, the B-29 was at 22,250 ft.

The sources of these reports are all World War II veterans and veterans of previous combat missions in Korea. The crews were from different squadrons and were interrogated separately.

II. DISCUSSION OF THE INCIDENT

The times that the object or objects followed the B-29's indicate that the objects were propelled by some means, which eliminates the possibility of an unguided ground-to-air missile, drop missiles, etc. The color and shape of the flame were studied by members of the ATIC Propulsion Group to determine whether or not the flame could have been the exhaust of a conventional jet engine with or without an afterburner, a pulse-jet, ram-jet, or rocket engine. None of these possibilities were considered to be applicable.

The report is somewhat similar to the reports of "fireball-fighters", a type of phenomena observed in Europe during World War II. The exact nature of this phenomena was never determined but bomber crews reported large fiery balls, similar to the sun, passing through or near their formations. There is no documented evidence or data available on this phenomena, and all the information that has been obtained is verbal from World War II bomber crewmen, consequently, few actual facts are available.

1. On two occasions on the night of 29 January 1953 • B-29 crews observed a spherical shaped object paralleling their course. The object was described as being "the color of the gun with occasional bluish tint". Details of the report may be obtained from the aircraft.

2. Since the objects followed the aircraft for uns of one minute and five minutes, it can be safely assumed that they were propelled (i.e., not soaring or free-drop missiles). Therefore, it is requested that the shape and color of the reported flame be analyzed for the possibility of the object being:

1. A review has been made of descriptive material regarding the observations made the night of 29 January 1951, by members of B-29 crews of tobe-lika fiery objects flying courses similar to friendly aircraft for short durations..

2. This group concurs that the objects appear to be propelled but from the descriptions and the time durations cited it is not considered that the objects are conventional jet engines, conventional jet engine with afterburner, pulsejet or rocket propelled. Slight credence, hovers, is given to the possibility of a ranjot powered helicopter or a modification thereof *, with provisions Incorporated for directing a along a section of the trailing edge of the rotor blade, creating the fuzzy edged, luminal changing of flimress and orges, globe shaped phenomena observed recently by members of the B-29 crews In Korea.

which because of combat fatigue, conditions of sightings, weather factors, etc., were assumed to be objects unattached to anything else. Such a report would appear reasonable in view of the fact that an object of this type would naturally become a center of interest, so to speak, and would tend to cause the observers to concentrate on its details rather than to look for anything else in conjunction with it.

7. A detailed investigation of such sightings is being conducted by ATIC. Thus far they have requested additional specific information from FEAF and pending the receipt of the reply to the request they cannot go on record with a firm evaluation. As soon as ATIC can furnish additional details this information will be made known through routine intelligence channels.

1. The following information is submitted upon which to base a reply to 
Senator Russell: 

a. The incident referred to in Senator Russell's letter occurred on the 
night 29-30 Jun 52. Two different B-29's of FEAF BOMCOM reported sighting an 
object which was described as follows: 

(1) Globe-shaped with slight tear drop effect on lower side. Color 
resembling sun (light orange) and occasionally changing to a 
bluish tint. Seemed to have internal churning movement like 
flames or fiery gases when at nearest point to B-29. (The orig- 
inal report stated that the object was disc-shaped and about 
three feet in diameter) One B-29 observed the object for five 
minutes while the second B-29 at a different location and 24 
minutes later observed a similar object for one minute. Although 
the size was estimated at three feet in both cases, the distance 
of the object (See next page)

From the B-29's could not be determined. The second aircraft received flak shortly after sighting this object. Crew numbers who reported the sightings were in both cases experienced combat crew men, having had experience over Germany in World War II as well as previous experience in the Korean theatre.

b. The press release referred to by Senator Russell actually contains a mixture of the information given in the preliminary FEAF report plus that contained in a later detaild report, which was submited subsequem to reinterrogation of the two crews. This release actually played up the "Flying saucer" aspects of the incidents based upon the initial description of "disc-shaped"

c. ATIC requested FEAF to furnish additional particulars, if available, following receipt of the preliminary reports. Additionally, they requested that FEAF alert their bomber crews to the possibility of such sightings in the future whereupon they would utilize fire control equipment in an effort to determine the distance of such objects from the observing aircraft. Thus far, there have been no additional reports from FEAF of similar sightings and neither ATIC nor APOIN-V/TC have arrived at a final evaluation of the incidents.

d. Based on the meager information thus far available, it is possible to arrive at only tentative evaluations of what the objects may have been. Two possible evaluations follow:

(1) Observation of the exhaust from an LA-9 or La-II Soviet fighter aircraft. The exhaust stacks on both these single-engine fighters are arranged in a cluster on each side of the fuselage, and it is believed that the exhaust emanating from this installation, when seen at night, would give an illusion such as described in the reports received.

(2) There have been several reports in the last few months of searchlights attached to jet and piston engined conventional aircraft which have intercepted FEAF bombers over Korea. These identifications have been stated to be positive in most instances. The use of such an airborne searchlights attached to a conventional aircraft on a very dark night would be a second possible explanation of the above incidents, since the attention of the crews would most probably be focused on the light source and this fact, coupled with the difficulty of discerning an aircraft silhouette, under extremely poor light conditions, could conceivably account for a report of this nature: DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.

OBSERVATION: Reference Marine pilot observation of balloons in Wonsan area
reported FEAF Intsum 651, 6 Apr 52, this Hqs has received no previous report of
the sighting or use of such balloons. An F-4 report recently received (Arl 5
AF, IR-17-52; 6 Mar 52) stated that "Globe-shaped orange-colored objects
recently reported sighted by UN aircraft were in reality a type of Wi II
Japanese balloon to be elevated "to frighten UN planes from areas", and were
being manufactured in Mancnuria. One possible explanation of the presently
reported sightings, if accurately described, could be that the enemy is experi-
menting with a new defense measure against low-level UN intrudiction efforts.
However, the size of the balloons (10-15 ft. in diameter) would seem to preclude
any great altitude capability.

III. CONCLUSIONS

No conclusions have been reached as to the identity or origin of these 
unidentified aerial objects. One possibility is that this may have been some 
type of flare towed by an aircraft to mark the B-29 for flak crews. No air-
craft exhaust flare was reported, however.

I. DISCUSSION OF INCIDENT
	
On the night of 29 January 1952 at 2300 and again at 2324, local Korea time, two B-29 crews at different locations observed similar objects near their aircraft. They described them as a disk, approximately three feet in diameter, and with a color similar to the sun. In one instance the object stayed beside the B-29 for five minutes and in the other for one minute.

II. STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION

More details on this incident have been requested.

SUMMARY (Enter concise summary omitting conclusions and evaluations. Give significance in first one or two paragraphs. List inclosures as last paragraph. Right and left margins as AF Form 112 – Part 11)
SUMMARY
1. Observed one globe shaped object with a slight tear drop effect noted on lower side, estimated size to be three feet across when at its nearest point to B-29. The size was not definitely established as the distance from the observer was not known. The color of the object resembled the sun, a light orange, and it occasionally changed to a bluish tint. The outer edge of the object appeared to be fuzzy and it seemed to have an internal churning movement like flames or fiery gases when it was at its nearest point to B-29. The object was first observed parallel on course at eight o'clock level, where it seemed to be about the size of a saucer, gradually becoming larger as it approached the B-29. It came in on the same level as the B-29 and remained in the same relative position to the B-29 for approximately one minute and then proceeded on the same path, fading away in the distance.

2. Sighted on January 29, 1952 for a period of approximately one minute. The left Gunner and Tail Gunner observed the object without the use of any optical or electronic equipment. The B-29 was at 22,250 feet, and ground speed 125 knots.

3. The two observers were airborne in the B-29 in the crew positions of Left Gunner and Tail Gunner. Object was observed at 3926N 12555E and level with the B-29.
