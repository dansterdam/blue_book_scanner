Dear Mr. [redacted],

With further reference to your letter of September 13, and the reply signed on October 2 by Colonel Bronitsky, we have received the following information from our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Without additional information, it is impossible, at this time, to offer an explanation as to what you saw. If you will complete the attached questionnaire and send it to us, the people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to perform an investigation and make an evaluation.

It is important for an individual to report his sighting as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force installation. Your case McDill AFB, Tampa, Florida. Each base has a UFO investigator, who is in a much better position to conduct an on-the-spot investigation.

No other unidentified flying object reports for September were received from the State of Florida.

Sincerely,

OCT 2 1967

Dear [redacted],

Vice President Humphrey has asked that I reply to your letter regarding the Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) you observed in the vicinity of Zephyrhills, Florida.

Unfortunately, your chances of obtaining an accurate analysis of your observation have been much less than had it immediately reported your observation to the UFO reporting officer at the nearest Air Force base. Responsible officials in Air Force headquarters have not been notified of your letter, and there is no official personnel assigned to the analysis of this case. However, if you will send them a completed, they will correspond with you further.

If your interest in this subject is appreciated. It is a group of officials who have been charged with the analysis of such phenomenon. They hope report will be of further assistance to you, and they will correspond with you as information develops.

Sincerely,
[Signed]
