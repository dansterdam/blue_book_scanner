11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Object was round, black or some dark color, about the size of a basket ball partially enclosed in a hazy or cloudy halo. The observer's opinion that at first it was thought the object was some type of a/c with a portion of it distinct, however, as it started to ascend, they decided it was possibly a balloon or some object just off the water, within a few minutes it began to ascend until it almost on the water again. This being observed until almost on the water again. This being observed until almost on the water again, when it slowly to descend until it was lost from view for approximately 20 seconds.

The text in the document is as follows:

The Intelligence Officer, 1236th Air Base Group, Ernest Harmon AF Base, Newfoundland, reported the sighting of an unidentified object near Sandy Point, Newfoundland, by three (3) Newfoundland native employees of the Motor Transport Division of Ernest Harmon AF Base. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes on 9 August 1950, at 2301Z (7:01 p.m.). The three witnesses, all employed for one and a half years (151/2), are 28, 34 and 35 years old, also employed by USAP for the last 2 1/2 years (21/2).

The sighting was made from approximately two miles off Indian Head (48° 29' N - 58° 30' W) and was approximately between Indian Head and Stephensville (48° 32' N - 58° 15' W) and approximately 1 to 1 1/2 miles off shore.

The object appeared to be about dark in color, round or barrel-shaped, and was described by all three witnesses as being round, black, or blue in color, about the size of a barrel and resembled a glider or an inflated balloon, according to their opinion. However, they decided it was possibly a balloon or some object released from the upper atmosphere. When it first appeared, it seemed to hover and then slowly descended until almost on the water again. This flying and descending occurred until it disappeared. Each cycle of ascending and descending lasted approximately 40-60 seconds. The object was observed to surface for approximately 5-10 minutes for approximately 3-5 times.

The water transportation officer, USAF, rated all three men as very reliable, stating that all were quiet and truthful.

All three men have a limited education with no military experience. The operation of the object with large target balloons was due to the fact that they had observed similar objects before and considered themselves qualified to handle the situation, thinking that there might be aerial gunnery conducted in the area.

The object was observed separately from high ground elsewhere, with no significance attached to the sightings other than the observers being qualified and recognizing the objects as something unusual - objects of unidentified nature were reported in this area.

A possibility exists that a weather balloon may have descended in this area, however, it is not possible to determine whether a weather balloon or something else caused the locally released balloons.

Local weather sequence was as follows: 1) 16302, 30 August 1950, ceiling 4,000 feet, visibility 15 miles, temperature 56°F, wind northwest at 15 knots. 2) 16352, 30 August 1950, ceiling broken at 5,000 feet, visibility 15 miles, wind northwest at 5 knots, temperature 55°F, dew point 48°F, wind north-northwest at 7 knots.

Control tower and GCA personnel were questioned with negative results.

Three aircraft (a B-29, a TCA DC-3, and a KLM DC-3) were observed field and tracked across the Coast prior to observation of the unidentified objects.
