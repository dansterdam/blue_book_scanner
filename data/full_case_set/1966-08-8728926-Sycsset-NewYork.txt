Dear _____

Reference is made to your recent letter regarding your unidentified flying object observations on August 29, 1966.

ECHO I was passing over central New York on August 17, at 3:54 p.m. ECHO I, the research and development satellite, passed overhead as a radio satellite. For the first four and one-half months of its life, before solar radiation and weathering began to deteriorate its performance, ECHO I was highly visible in the night sky.

According to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Star Catalog, there are other man-made Earth satellites you may have observed. If you wish to know which specific satellite you observed, I would suggest you contact the Director, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Cambridge, Massachusetts. They maintain the responsibility of tracking all satellites and satellite components.

I hope you will find the above information useful.  Thank you for your interest in our program.

Sincerely,

1. Reference the attached letter from requesting information on an observation which he made on 17 August 1966. ECHO I was received on 17 August at 2234Z. ECHO I first four and one-half months of its life, before solar radiation and meteorological inducted its reflecting power. This satellite is not classified.

2. According to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Star Catalogue, Brightne, it is sugeested that he contact the Space Tracking and Data Acquisition Network in Colorado; they have the responsibility of tracking all satellites and satellites components.

UFO SIGHTING, 17 August 1966 SEP 27 1966

1. Reference the attached letter from requesting information on an observation which he made on 17 August 1966.
ECHO ECHO ECHO: This individual claims that while driving to New York City on 17 August 1966, at approximately 8:30 PM, he observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be satellite following an erratic course. This occurred at or near Sycsset, Long Island, New York. He observed the object for approximately three and one-half months of its life, before solar radiation dimmed its brilliance. This satellite is not one of those 'cataloged by the tracking device'.

2. According to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Star Catalog, there are no known satellites visible which would correspond with the visual magnitude (brightness) as described. If this should prove to be a natural satellite, it is requested that the Space Tracking and Surveillance Center be advised for its responsibility of tracking all satellites and satellite components.

Dear Sir:

On the evening of August 17, 1966, I spotted an object 
over Syosset, Long Island. It was approximately
6 minutes past 9 p.m. and it was descending rapidly. It 
was a greenish-white light and it disappeared within about 
5 minutes to cross the sky. 

I would be possible to send me the name for the satellite 
I observed?

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]
