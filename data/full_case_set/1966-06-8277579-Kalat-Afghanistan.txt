Kingdom of Afghanistan
Province of Kabul
City of Kabul
American Embassy

Before me, Charles L. Darby, Vice Consul of the United States of America at the United States of America Embassy, personally appeared who, being duly sworn, deposed and says as follows:

1. My name is [redacted], who, being duly sworn, deposed and says as follows:
2. I am a Foreign Service Officer of the United States of America presently assigned as [redacted] at the American Embassy.
3. Because I was requested on the night of June 10, 1966, and the morning of June 11, 1966, to drive from Kabul to Kalat, Afghanistan, accompanied by Patrick Doyer, ROCCIO of the Marine Security Guard, American Embassy, Kabul, to investigate a reported sighting of an unidentified flying object.
4. We left Kabul at approximately 10:30 pm on June 10, 1966, and drove directly to Mukkur, Afghanistan. We reached Mukkur at about 2:15 AM.
5. At about 3:00 AM W/Sgt. Doyer had an intestinal attack and asked that we return to Kabul, which we did, arriving at the American Embassy at about 5:15 AM.
6. At the American Embassy W/Sgt. Doyer was checked by the medical officer and appeared to be an extremely bright star very low on the horizon. It appeared to be an extremely bright star with rapid gyrations and about the size of a car headlight. I asked it to look at the object, but it did not respond. Stating that it was probably just a star, I had to look at the object, stating that it was definitely not a star and that it appeared to be a mechanical device in the air, hovering and performing maneuvers. I watched the object for a few minutes and assured that it was moving, but not in any pattern. It seemed to move in a random fashion, sometimes hovering, sometimes moving about a central point, moving horizontally and vertically as described in the following figure.

OCR output:

Before changing direction of movement, the object always seemed to return to point A. It did not seem to travel directly between C and D.

6.After we had decided that the object was moving I instead that the time was 3:10 AM. We watched the object another ten minutes and it appeared to move in the same place.

7.The object then appeared to stand still for about 20 to 30 seconds. It then reappeared and moved rapidly in a straight line to the east for a distance of about a mile or more. It glowed and appeared that it was four or five times as bright as the North Star as bright and blue in color. The object then reversed its course and moved rapidly in a westerly direction disappearing from sight. The object was silent and definitely brighter than a low ridge between it and myself.

8.As we were continuing our activity 3:30 AM driving, I sat in the right front seat. Capt. Wyer seated on the rear seat. Almost continually we observed the object. Capt. Wyer remained in the rear seat. The object drew nearer and nearer. As it approached about fifteen or twenty degrees above the horizon, when we had been traveling about an additional fifteen degrees, it disappeared from sight. It alternated between its originally brightness and being quite dull. A steady course alternated with some slight irregularity for about a half two minutes.  

9.We arrived in Kalat at 4:15 A.M. The object was about thirty degrees above the horizon and shining brightly. Due to our business in Kalat we were not able to observe it continuously after that. I did check it at about five minutes intervals. I seemed to remain in the same place and position.

10.Light from the sun had begun to show about the time we arrived in Kalat. The sun rose up about 4:15 about fifteen degrees to the right of the object. The object began to appear dimmer to the right of the object.

Transcribed text from the document:

- 3 -
Though the object was in the past, it was among the last four objects to disappear from the night sky. The other three were the moon, one star in the west, and another star almost directly overhead, but strangely to the side of Kalat.

While it is entirely possible that the disappearance of the object while it was undoubtedly in motion may have been due to hilliness or mountains in the area, the manner in which the object disappeared was the same as when it first appeared and returned while we remained in the area.

I understand that M/ S- will be filling an affidavit similar to this. I also understand that M/ S- have been interviewed, and they were supposed to watch for the object at length but we have not file a report.

And further deponent saith not.

Subscribed and sworn before me this 16th day of June, 1966.
