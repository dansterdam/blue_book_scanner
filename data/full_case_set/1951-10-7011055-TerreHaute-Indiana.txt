12D 1-11-100, SUBJECT: UNKNOWN SUBJECT, Unidentified Aerial Object Sighted Over Indiana. Aerial Object Sighted, Terre Haute, 9 October 1951

Observed no vapor trails; heard no noise and observed no protruding fins or other projections on this aerial object. Described as about 250 feet in diameter, shaped like a disc, and that he observed the object pass from directly over his head to the horizon in approximately 2 seconds, which he considered to be a conservative estimate of time. The day was clear, a bright sun, no clouds or haze; sighting was not obstructed by buildings or other objects. Due to the speed of the object, no further details of object could still be observed at the time it disappeared over the horizon. It is stated that the object's size or altitude, according to Dr. Conner, if this object was 250 feet high, it would have been traveling approximately 2,500 miles per hour and that the speed in miles per hour would increase in proportion to the object's altitude. On Flying Saucer trend continued south of Terre Haute, Indiana, at approximately 1345 hours, Tuesday, 9 October 1951. The sighting was at an altitude of 5,000 feet over Greencastle, Indiana, no details on the speed or altitude of this object. It is stated that such sightings do not increase or diminish in frequency with the approach of such things as the objects themselves. The object was then observed to be traveling in a northeasterly direction south of the Atomic Energy plant at Newport, Indiana.

PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

1. An unconventional unidentified aerial object was observed by Chief Aviation Radio-maman Chides at Terre Haute, Indiana. Observation was made on 9 October 1951 at 13.12 CST for approximately 15 seconds.

2. The following descriptions were obtained in an interview with the observer:
Object appeared as a shiny disc-like object approximately 1-1/2 miles in diameter, silver colored with no vapor or exhaust trail and no sound. Propulsion was unknown, seemed to hover and then accelerate at a terrific speed.

3. Object was sighted visually from the ground and observed to travel a straight course southwesterly. Object maintained a steady altitude and was visible for approximately 15 seconds.

4. Weather: CAVU with bright sun, winds at Chanute AFB on 9 October at 13.00 CST average direction 230 degrees, average velocity 15 knots. No physical evidence available. No interceptions made.

5. Conclusion: Object appeared to be a solid, shiny object slightly smaller than a small house, no vapor or exhaust trail and made no sound. It hovered briefly and then accelerated at a very fast rate of speed. Two sightings were of the same object at 13.12 CST just east of Paris, 13 Illinois, at 5,000 feet altitude. No other corroborating data available. Recommendation: Sighting could not be identified. Description south of sound.

6. Although an accurate measurement of the distance between sighting and observer was not possible from the information furnished, the object could not have been more than 4-5 miles away from the observer. The information furnished gave no indication that the two sightings were of the same object.
