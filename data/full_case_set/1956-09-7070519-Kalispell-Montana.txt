II. RELIABILITY: Source is male, was at one time in an automobile accident, but did not sustain any major injuries. He was completely coherent and gave the information rationally. His description did not coincide with anything he believed to have been known at the time.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF PHENOMENON: Source was at his home, with his wife, looking out the window when he observed the object. This was approximately at 6:05 P.M. Sept. 26, 1956. The object was in sight for approximately 3 to 4 minutes. The object was round or oval in shape, hovering, and was a dull, metallic color. It appeared to be twice as large as a full moon above the horizon. There was no sound, but many beams of light were visible, seemingly "shooting in and out". These beams of light were approximately 25 to 30 feet in length, and changed color from white to green to amber. On several occasions, the object appeared to "spark up" very brightly. It then would gradually dim again. There was no trail or vapor associated with the object.

Though it had appeared to be hovering, the object finally ascended at a terrific speed, "like a bullet going straight up into the sky". There seemed to be no sound. The object was then lost to sight, the ascent appearing to be possibly 3 or 4 miles.

6. The object moved erratically and with great speed. Source compared the object to a jet aircraft, but it moved much faster than any jet aircraft he had ever observed. The object darted back and forth, as if under intelligent control.

7. Both source and his wife observed the object and the cloud through binoculars until the object finally disappeared from sight. The object moved so rapidly that it was difficult to observe clearly, indicating low power or lack of thrust.

8. The object seemed to stop, hover a moment, then move off rapidly in another direction, almost as if under intelligent control.

9. Source and his wife continued to observe the object from their back door in a ranch-type house and saw another moving object high in the sky, which they believed was the same object. This second object exhibited only a slight vertical move upward and then moved off rapidly in a south-southwest direction in a manner that seemed intelligently controlled.

10. No sounds were heard at any time.

13. When the object first appeared, it seemed to have a dull gray color, approximately the size of a baseball at arm's length. Its position was estimated to have been at an angle of approximately 45 to 50 degrees above the horizon, approximately in the east.

14. The object exhibited a rapid, jerky motion, appearing to dart or move in any direction, occasionally appearing to draw closer, then to disappear from sight, only to reappear a short distance away, seemingly as if it was approaching, and seemed to disappear in the southwest.

1. Terrain: Source's property is a ranch-type dwelling.

I. SOURCE: Mrs. ***** *****, 23 Sunset Street, Kalispell, Montana
Age: 49 
Occupation: Housewife
Education: 14 years
Qualifications: 60 post graduate work., Kalispell, Montana; has been with OCO for two years and is now a supervisory clerk in the USAF, where she has access to CCB and also the USAF. 

II. RELIABILITY: Source was a vigorous, alert woman, eager to volunteer all the data she could supply. She spoke with authority and was the most important witness in this investigation. She has access to the CCB and is fully acquainted with its procedures, because of her position in the USAF.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
On the night of 7 September 1956 at about 7:40 pm, the source was at her home when she was notified by the Kalispell GCC that an unidentified flying object had been detected on the radar screen, traveling in a northwesterly direction. She immediately went outside and observed the object with her naked eye. She described it as round, glowing intensely, and moving with a great speed in a straight line. The size was estimated to be one-third the apparent diameter of the moon. The color was gold and with very many small lights flickering on and off, giving the appearance of a "rippling effect". There was no noise or trail of any kind. 

The object was according to her, performing maneuvers of a most incredible nature. It would suddenly change directions at right angles, making extremely sharp turns, and at one point she observed it come to a complete stop in the sky, hovering motionless for a minute or two, then accelerate at a fantastic rate of speed. 

According to the source, she had frequently observed the planet Venus, and that this object was definitely different, being much larger, intensely brilliant, and displaying the characteristics of controlled flight. She stated that she had frequently observed the planet Venus, and that this object was definitely different, being much larger, intensely brilliant, and displaying the characteristics of controlled flight.

She estimated the duration of the sighting to be approximately 20 minutes. When she lost sight of the object, it was moving in a northerly direction. She immediately reported the incident to the CCB and a full investigation was initiated. According to the source, the CCB is taking this incident very seriously and considers it to be one of the most important UFO sightings on record.

6. The object moved erratically and made sharply angled turns; the duration of the object's movement during one of these turns was estimated to be ten times the duration of the other turns.

10,000 feet. The source estimated the height of the object to be between 9,000 and 10,000 feet.

8. Source stated that the object was observed through low-powered binoculars.

9. Source continued to observe the object during the rest of the time, which lasted approximately one hour. The object then disappeared and did not reappear until dawn at 0547Z Sep 26 (0547 hours MST, 4 Sep 26).

10. Source stated that the object appeared twice during the 4 1/2 hour period from dawn to 0547Z Sep 26 (0547 hours MST, 4 Sep 26). When the object first reappeared at dawn, it was estimated to be about one-third as bright as it had been the previous evening. The second time the object appeared, it was estimated to be about one-tenth as bright as it had been the previous evening.

11. Source stated that she had never before encountered anything like this incident.

II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE AND INFORMATION SOURCE IMPRESSED US: The investigators are being distinctly above average intelligence and ability. The details of their observations and reports indicate very careful thought and study of the available evidence. They are convinced that this report represents a valid sighting and are presenting their information as accurately as possible, although the know that sightings of such objects should be reported.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
1. Source was in his residence when the GOC Post supervisor telephoned him and informed him that some unusual objects were spotted in the south-southeastern sky and requested his opinion as to its identity.
2. Source immediately went outside and observed a brilliant glow descending towards the horizon, approximately 75 degrees above the horizon. He observed it for about 15 minutes. 
3. The object appeared red, but later appeared to turn to white. This object would disappear at varying intervals, and then reappear. During the disappearance, the object left a trail across the sky, leaving a cloud.
4. Source declined to estimate the size of the object, stating frankly that he could not do so. He stated that it was difficult and that it was impossible to judge the size of such an object in the sky.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was caused by the planet Mars. On 7 September 1956, the planet Mars will be closer to the earth than it has been since 1924; its brilliance may have caused the sighting. 
2. On 7 September 1956, the planet Mars will be visible in the eastern sky at approximately 0400 hours (see 28 May 1956 message from Captain Phillip Reber) at an angle of 31 degrees from the horizon. The sighting occurred at approximately 0230 hours (see 2 Sep 26 message from Captain Phillip Reber). These hours are consistent with the position of the planet Mars as described above.
3. The position of the planet Mars is consistent with that reported in the sighting.
4. Although all of the object's reported characteristics appeared appreciably larger and brighter than the planet Mars, this observed phenomenon may be reasonably explained and accounted for due to the close proximity of the planet Mars to the earth. This astronomical anomaly is not inconsistent with service to the IGY.
5. Observation of any star or planet through a rift of haze or moisture will give the impression of erratic movement. This in no way indicates the object's ownership is other than the planet Mars.
6. It is the significance and intensity of the power of observation of sources that have prepared this wind, not necessarily the validity of being from the planet. This consideration is as important as the other hypothesis or UFO's meta identification criteria.

September 3, 1956 - Montana - An unidentified flying object, described as a glowing, cone-shaped object, hovered and maneuvered over Kalispell, Montana for about 15 minutes and then disappeared in a westerly direction.

The report states that the object became brighter and dimmer alternately, and at times it faded out of sight entirely. It was sighted at 5:30 a.m. and disappeared at 5:45 a.m.

The report also mentions a "shining triangle" surrounded by a yellow glow, which hovered in the sky throughout the night. It disappeared westward early the next Tuesday morning.

The Air Force and civilian officials viewed the objects, but were unable to explain them as natural phenomena. The report indicates that the objects were picked up on radar.
