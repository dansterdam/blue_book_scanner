JUNE 1962 
EVALUATION BY OFFICE OF TECHNICAL STAFF UAL 11094 13 JULY 1962 CLASSIFIED INTERIM REPORT ON SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION OF REPORTS CONCERNING PHENOMENA WITNESSED AT HALLOTT STATION ANTARCTICA DURING THE PERIOD OF 26 JANUARY 1962 THROUGH 4 MARCH 1962
THE STATION WAS MANNED BY A 3-MAN CREW AS FOLLOWS:
CHIEF SCIENTIST - CHARLES P. SMITH 
CHIEF RADIO OPERATOR - RICHARD R. HARRIS
COOK/GENERAL ASSISTANT - JOHN 0. GREENE
AT APPROXIMATELY 00:30 HOURS ON 26 JANUARY 1962, ALL THREE MEN WERE AWAKENED BY A STRANGE NOISE. UPON INVESTIGATION, THEY OBSERVED A LUMINOUS OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OVER THE STATION. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 60 FEET IN DIAMETER AND SPHERICAL IN SHAPE. THE OBJECT EMITTED A PULSATING BLUE-WHITE LIGHT AND MADE A LOUD HUMMING NOISE. DURING THE NEXT FEW MINUTES, IT BEGAN TO RISE STEADILY UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. THE MEN WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. THEY WERE QUITE SHAKEN BY THE EXPERIENCE AND REPORTED IT TO THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION IMMEDIATELY. OTHER STAFF MEMBERS WERE INFORMED AND CORROBORATED THE ACCOUNT. SINCE THAT TIME, NO FURTHER INCIDENTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED. HOWEVER, THE MEN HAVE REMAINED VISIBLY NERVOUS AND APPREHENSIVE. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION IS PLANNED.

Intelligence Division (Objects Sighted in the
Antarctica
SUMMARY (Major Hart)
WAPD-3-50

1. On 7 June 1962 at 0152 witnesses at Hallett Station, 72-20 S and 170-00 E observed an object sighted and identified as "something like a first magnitude star". This object was sighted at an apparent hearing of 360 degrees and an elevation angle of 20 degrees. The time of observation was for more than five minutes. This sighting is probably resulted from the misidentification of the planet Jupiter, which was very near the station at this time and date. At the time of the sighting Jupiter was making a near south-easterly direction in the sky and less than fifteen degrees from the horizon.

2. On 22 June 1962 at 0303 Z an object leaving a smoke or vapor trail was observed from Hallett Antarctic Station. The object was reported to be brighter than a flare, white in color and to have an apparent size larger than a standard star. The object was observed for approximately 1-2 minutes. There was no noise associated with this object. The object was initially described as a very bright meteor or a fireball but further evaluation indicated that this was probably a man-made space vehicle. No other details concerning the object or the observation are known.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract the text from the document:

It is concluded that a fireball and the trail it generated was responsible for the report on 22 June 1962.

1. On 7 July 1962 at 1132 an intense light was observed from Hallett Station, Antarctica. The light was described as very bright, much brighter than a flare or a building, and the observer noted that it passed between two mountains, disappearing behind them. The observer estimated the duration of the light to be about 5 seconds.

2. Upon further inquiries, it was learned that the light was observed by a number of personnel at Hallett Station and when it passed, a discussion arose as to what it could be. The consensus was that it was some type of fireball or meteor, and there was no evidence or suggestion of it being anything else.

3. It is concluded that this object was a fireball and in addition are heard to pass this report as it stands as one of the few authenticated UFO incidents in the Antarctic, but that further investigation would be required to establish the actual facts concerning this sighting. This sighting appeared to be the U.S. satellite 1962-31A (Echo II). This satellite decayed on 7 July 1962 and there is a possibility that the re-entry of this satellite could have accounted for the fireball sighting at Hallett Station.

4. APD is not aware of any United States or foreign activities which could account for the unidentified flying object sighted in the Antarctica on 7 and 22 June 1962. Further there is no evidence available which indicates that those sightings were due to other than natural phenomena.

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document or report related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

"2 June at 07/010Z, the UFO at Hallett Station in the Antarctic made an appearance over the station area for some 90 minutes. The object was at a 30 degrees elevation and 330 degrees heading. It was golden in color and appeared to be self-luminous, hovering, and pulsating. This object was observed by several individuals with binoculars and the unaided eye. The light seemed to be associated with the object. The light remained stationary although it seemed to pulsate. Several individuals who observed it estimated the size of the object to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. It was observed for approximately 30 minutes, after which it suddenly accelerated and disappeared into the distance. There were no sound effects associated with the object. The light remained on until the object had disappeared from view. No additional objects have been noted.

Attached is the report received at HQ (Havel Message #A11) 2 3503 (11 Jun 62) regarding this incident. No photographs were taken but sketches were made to aid in the analysis."
