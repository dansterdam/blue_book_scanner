COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. The lack of performance points make the estimates of size and altitude unreliable. No information is available on any weather conditions other than the general statement that the weather was clear. There is no indication of any aircraft or other objects in the area at the time of the sighting, and no evidence of any interception or identification action taken.

STATEMENT OF M. COLONEL . . .
CUSTOMS SOURCE AND HARBOR POLICE, MANILA, PHILIPPINE ISLANDS

On the evening of 27 December, 1952 while the U.S.S. General A. W. Brewster was lying in Bataan Province waters near Olongapo, Philippine Islands, several persons observed four (4) unknown lights in the sky. These lights were sighted by the Commanding Officer, the Customs Guard, and the Harbor Police and appeared to be hovering and maneuvering over the vessel. After approximately 30 to 40 minutes the lights disappeared. This incident was reported to my headquarters and to the local authorities.

The night was clear with a full moon. There was no wind and the sea was calm. According to the Customs Guard and Harbor Police, the lights were about thirty thousand (30,000) to thirty-five thousand (35,000) feet in altitude.

I have not divulged this information to any unauthorized individuals and have instructed those concerned to avoid public discussions of the incident. However, I decided to relate what facts I have to your investigation upon the request of your representative.

I have read the foregoing statement consisting of one page and have initialed all corrections. This statement is the truth to the best of my knowledge and belief.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force investigation of UFO reports. The document is an "Air Intelligence Information Report" dated 29-53 and describes an incident that occurred on January 23, 1953 involving a small light observed near Bataan, Philippines. The report details the eyewitness account and the investigator's analysis of the incident.

STATEMENT OR INCIDENT 
On the evening of 23 January 1953, Lt. Colonel Clarence S. C. Chief of the Intelligence Section, 13th Air Force, Headquarters, O. D. Wheeler Field, Philippine Islands, reported the following:

On the evening of 23 January 1953, a small light was observed off BATAAN COVE, between ABUCAY and MARIVELES, for approximately 1 hour. Four Air Force Officers and one Philippine Island Civil Service employee, who were on a fishing trip, first sighted the light at about 1900 hours and continued to observe it until about 2000 hours. The light was located approximately 5 miles off shore and about 300 feet above the water. It was described as a small white light, approximately 10-12 feet in diameter, and emanating a very bright light. The light moved rapidly at first, then hovered in one position, suddenly increased in size, and then disappeared. It reappeared in another position and repeated the same maneuvers. All witnesses stated that the object did not resemble any known aircraft. They were unable to determine what the object was, but were definite in their opinions that it was not a conventional aircraft.

I have read the foregoing statement consisting of one page and have initialed it. This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Subscribed and sworn to before me this 10th day of February 1953.

3. Sighting only lasted approximately 14 seconds after which objects seemed to disappear. During this interval the objects appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed in relation to the size and distance from the observer.
4. When the objects disappeared, the time lapse between completion of sighting and disappearance of objects was approximately 3 to 5 seconds.
