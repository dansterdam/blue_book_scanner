Flying Saucer Adds More Spice to Gloria's Night

Actress Swanson Treks to Hills for Look at Disk After Exciting Half-Hour on TV

No televiewer watching This Is Your Life Wednesday night would have guessed that Actress Gloria Swanson was excited about a flying saucer as she graciously accepted plaudits on her colorful career during the pro-

Yet within the hour she was walking through dark- ness and mud in the Hollywood Hills inspecting a 12- foot disk that reportedly had crash landed off Lakeidge Road.

The saucer story started Wednesday morning after Miss Swanson learned inad- vertently that she was to be surprised guest on This Is Your Life and would appear, neverthe- less, despite the show’s pre- cident that demands secrecy.

“Romantic Swanson”

Robert Balzer, wealthy importer and close friend of the actress, told her a star- tling story he had heard from a pupil iner tent, a story of a flying saucer that had landed in the hills. A saucer- hunt had been seen, he was...

No Case (Information Only)
January 1957
Florida

January 1957-Florida- Donald Freestone, master mechanic, at C.O.S., reports that while testing weather radar equipment, he picked up a mysterious flying object that played a long "tag" with ships off Florida for several minutes before disappearing in space at 4,000 miles per hour. Freestone said the object has four or five times larger than any aircraft he had ever seen on radar at an altitude of 7,000 or 8,000 feet. Lt. Christ emphasized about 65 miles S E of Miami at an altitude of 7,000 or 8,000 feet. Because the object had a definite shape and moved on a definite course. Freestone doesn't think it was a freak return on the radarscope.

FIREBALL OF 1957 JANUARY 17
A.W.S. Inc. 2367
P. E. BROGAN and C. P. CLIVIER

On this date at about 6:25 p.m. P.S.T., a spectacular fireball appeared over Oregon, went roughly N.N.W., and ended over British Columbia. Immediately at its appearance, P. E. Brogan, A.M.S. regional director for the region, made efforts to secure reports, both through newspapers and by personal contacts. In all, 13 witnesses appeared to belong to this body were obtained, 11 by him, 2 by Miss Eleanor Schrader of Hailey, Idaho. Most of the reports are incomplete, partly due to some observers being in cars or indoors. The fireball's color, reported by 5, was blue; green for three, or a combination of these colors. There is no specific claim of brightness or angular size; pepper "large." However, one in it owns a diameter of two moon sizes noted that also apparent was half that of the moon. An aviator specified seeing it from Nevada but, as for U.S., we know coordinates only by aviators who must know what altitude and bearings are, practically never give them besides a mystery? Only 4 appears attempted to give the altitude of beginning point and 6 its azimuth. From these latter a roughly determined sub-path beginning point is found and an even less certain high H1 for beginning point.

RECENT SIGHTING REPORTS

DIAMOND-SHAPED FORMATION OVER BINGHAMTON, NEW YORK

January 25, 1957: CSI member Mrs. [redacted], of Binghamton, New York, sent us the details of a personal observation made at 6:35 a.m. on January 25. She saw four white lights in the southeast quadrant, traveling slowly east parallel to the horizon and 6 to 8 degrees above it, in a diamond-shaped formation. "The sky was overcast, so that the lights were diffused; at times the lights at the front and rear of the formation flashed brighter." They were in sight for about ten minutes, and were then lost in the thick overcast. As they moved away toward the east the lights became less bright, but did not diminish in size. Mrs. [redacted] was quite certain they could not be planes because of the intensity of the front and rear lights.

NORTH ANDOVER HAS NOCTURNAL INTRUDER

January 28, 1957: CST member _________ of North Andover, Massachusetts, describes in detail an observation by his father. At 10:15 p.m., Mr. _________ had put his car in the garage and was walking to the house when he saw "an object giving off a light blue luminescence...in a shallow climb and traveling at a speed approximately that of a fast jet plane." The object was circular and appeared to be "slightly larger than a basketball." Its distance was estimated to be slightly more than a half-mile away and its estimated altitude was 1,500 to 2,000 feet. No structural detail was seen. The object was silent and left no trail. Visibility was good, with scattered clouds at about 20,000 feet. There was no moon and only a very slight wind.

"The UFO was traveling west to east and seemed to be rapidly spinning, like a child's top in motion." Its speed seemed to increase as it traveled away from the viewer. Growing smaller, it finally went out of sight. Mr. ________ had watched it for about 30 seconds.

This is to acknowledge your letter of 11 November 1957, addressed to the United States Air Force, concerning material found in Glendora, New Jersey in 1957.

The information contained in your letter is much too old to estimate the conclusions and/or evaluations on the material considered and will through this fact not be considered at this time for analysis. I wish we had, in our files, facts to help you in this instance.

Morristown, N.J., U.S.A.
11 November 1958

Office of Naval Research
Washington 25, D.C.

Gentlemen,

Recently our organization has undertaken an investigation of some strange material which apparently fell from the sky into a residential New Jersey community.

I have enclosed a resume' of the case. Because the material looks somewhat like melted porcelain, ceramic, or glass, with drops of melted copper-like material included in it, my mind connected it with recent information I have come upon, about government experiments with high-temperature re-entry cones on missiles.

A ceramic nose-cone, as I understand it, coated with a thin sheet of copper or cuprous alloy would withstand high temperatures during re-entry, as the copper melted and evaporated, thus cooling the ceramic, which could then withstand the temperatures at lower altitudes by itself.

I should like to know if the material described briefly herein could, in your opinion, be attributed to any such experiments, if such activities have indeed been conducted by your agency or any other department.

Please accept my apologies...I realize this is a rather vague request. But I felt if such experiments have been conducted, your office would know, and would further know if the area or results are to be connected in any way with U. S. missile activity.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely,

[Signature Redaction]

Gentlemen:

About ten years ago I saw a U.F.O.
It happened like this.

My family & I were up near Mount 
Pleasant visiting my now late father
& his family. Everyone was asleep except
Dad & I. Dad had to give his wife, 
a nurse in Mt. Pleasant and asked me 
if I wanted to come keep him company.
I went.

Well we had just topped a
hill when I saw it. It was so close

I thought it was going to hit the car. I was about to ask Dad if he saw it, but before I could it had disappeared.

I never saw it nor any other UFO since.

When I saw it I thought it might have been Sputnik I. It had just been launched about one month before I saw the U.F.O.

If you have any questions,
I will try my best to answer them.

Sincerely yours,

Proposed reply to letter from ****************, 22 March 1957

Dear Miss ************,

This replies to your letter of March 22, 1957 in which you mentioned an unidentified observation you made in approximately 1957.

We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will file your letter for information purposes. At this late date, it would be impractical to undertake a detailed investigation. It is important that an individual report his or her observation as soon as possible. This enables Air Force analysts to perform a comprehensive investigation.

Your interest in the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects is appreciated.
