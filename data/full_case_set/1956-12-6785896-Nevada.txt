There is no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document and provide the output as follows:

12. CONCLUSIONS

X Possibly Astronomical
Insufficient Data for Evaluation
11. COMMENTS
Description and characteristics of object indicate that pilot apparently saw an extremely close [unreadable] of a meterial fireball. The impact with the denser portion of the earth's atmosphere Observing such a body at close range is generally considered by Air Force authorities to be the true explanation.
