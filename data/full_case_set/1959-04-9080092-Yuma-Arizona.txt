REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

Yuma, Arizona
April 9, 1959
8092

This report concerns a report made to the Yuma, Arizona Air Force Base on 9 April 1959 of a sighting of an unidentified flying object.

The report was made by Mr. E.R. Hamilton, a resident of Yuma, Arizona.

According to Mr. Hamilton, on the evening of 8 April 1959 at approximately 8:00 P.M. he observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving rapidly in a northeasterly direction. The object was observed for approximately 5 minutes before it disappeared from view.

Mr. Hamilton described the object as being bright and elliptical in shape. He stated the object was traveling at a high rate of speed, much faster than any conventional aircraft he had ever observed.

The Yuma Air Force Base was notified of the sighting and an investigation was initiated. No other reports of the sighting were received from the local area.

Based on the information provided by Mr. Hamilton, and the lack of any other corroborating reports, the Yuma Air Force Base was unable to conclusively identify the object observed. The case was therefore classified as unidentified.
