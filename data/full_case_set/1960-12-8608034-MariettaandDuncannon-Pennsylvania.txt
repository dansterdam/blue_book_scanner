The text on the document is as follows:

Headquarters USAF
Tndex
Washington 25, D.C.
Attention: SAFOI
Dear Sirs:
Captain Moore of the USAF New Haven Office has indicated that the matter involved here was an unusual sighting of a possible unidentified flying object.
At 2:30 to 3:45 a.m. on December the 14th, the writer was proceeding from the Connecticut-Pennsylvania-New Jersey State Troopers station in Stanford, Connecticut. At that time, he noticed a very rapidly moving red light on the left horizon, traveling from northwest to southeast. To his left, rear and directly upper part of the windshield of the car, and proceeded across the center line or our vision traveling in an approximate Westerly direction.
Initially, the object glowed bright red and left a trail, then extinguished and appeared periodically as a visible luminous change was noted. Similar to a flash bulb going off, then the trail changed to a flickering glow concluding above the horizon.
The object appeared to be much closer than a normally viewed meteor or satellite. The intensity was considerably brighter than the writer had ever observed for falling stars, and the speed was faster than the writer had ever witnessed for Satellites or airplanes.
The writer would be pleased to supply any additional information he might develop and believes he could accurately pinpoint the location of the automobile to within one mile if necessary.
Very truly yours,

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Headquarters USAF
Washington 25, D.C.

Attention: SAFOI

Dear Sirs:

Certain Hoover of the USAF New
Writer "should contact you regarding
a sighting. The circumstances are as follows:

At 5:30 to 5:45 a.m. on December the 12th, the writer was proceeding along the Susquehanna Turnpike, between Middleport and Stamford. I noticed a very rapidly moving red object crossing the sky, dead ahead. In a few seconds, it entered the Susquehanna River Valley, dropped down very near the surface of the car which I was driving in an approximate westerly direction.

Initially, the object glowed bright red and left a trail, then suddenly at about 10 seconds, a visible intensity change was noted; i.e. similar to a flash bulb going off; then the trail changed to a pulsating or oscillation-type motion.

The object appeared to be much closer than a normally viewed meteor or satellite, in fact, the intensity was considerably greater than the writer had ever observed for falling stars, and its color was much more the color of red phosphorous than the white of a meteor.

The writer would be pleased to supply any additional information he might could actually pinpoint the location of the automobile to within one mile if necessary.

Very truly yours,

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a Project 10073 record card from the Project Blue Book UFO investigation program.

PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 14 JUL 60
2. DATE-TIME GROUP: Local
3. GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES: Marietta & Dundannon, Pennsylvania
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: G. Ground-Radar
5. EQUIPMENT: G. Ground-Radar, Civilian
6. SOURCE: G. Civilian
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 15 minute
10. CHIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Through an alert radar this object was tracked, and radar tracing showed an object moved from left to right at an estimated speed of 10 miles per minute. When object reached a point 10 miles north of the observers it appeared to accelerate and disappeared from the radar scope.
11. COMMENTS: Considered unusual for the equipment involved. Brightness or these echoes seem to indicate that this object was comparable to aircraft metal in reflecting area. This has remained an unidentified flying object, especially as to the judgment of distance being critical as the echoes were so unusual in characteristics of a meteor or aircraft.
