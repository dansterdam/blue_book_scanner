The image does not contain a photograph, but rather two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon (skyline) and an object above it, with the instruction to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate where the object was first seen and how high it was above the horizon. 

The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene with a person in the foreground, and two smaller inset sketches - one showing a similar landscape with a curved horizon, and the other showing a more distant landscape with a curved horizon.

OCR text output:
32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
