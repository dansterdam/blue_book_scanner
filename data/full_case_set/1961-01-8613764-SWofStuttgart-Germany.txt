10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Two irregular objects were picked up on ground radar. A round-shaped object appeared, then disappeared. The radar then picked up another object which reached a Zenith and then dived out after passage. Witness state that the objects moved faster than anything the witness had ever seen before.
11. COMMENTS: This case appears to indicate a "Technical" sighting of an unnatural object in that the objects were detected on radar and observed visually. The sighting was of short duration, but the objects exhibited unusual capabilities in their movements, color and size. This sighting is considered a valid indication of the presence of Unidentified Flying Objects.
