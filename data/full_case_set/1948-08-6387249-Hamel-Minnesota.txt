Dear Captain Wotter

On August 11, 1948, this office received a
letter from Mr. E. W. Sheridan, Postmaster, Hamel, Minnesota,
which reads as follows:

"A farmer, who lives a short distance from this vil-
lage, reported to this office that his two sons, aged 8
& 10, had been playing near their dad's job, which
looked like two plates inverted piled to the ground
about eight feet from one of the boys. When it hit the
ground it pounded very rapidly and disappeared.

"This object came in from the northwest & disappeared to
the northeast. It was a silver colored object. Evident-
ly this farmer believes what his sons saw some object and
I have no reason to doubt his word. For your information."

This matter is being referred to you for what-
ever action you deem advisable. No investigation is being conducted
by this office.

Very truly yours,

ACTION TAKEN ON HAMEL, MINN, INCIDENT

Reference letter 17 Aug 1948 from Eq 5th Army, received MCIA(X)2-3 on
20 August 1948, pertaining to incident in Hamel, Minnesota, the following
action has been taken:

On 20 Aug 48 a call was placed to Hq, 5th Army, contacting Lt Col
William B. Allison, Executive Officer, G-2. Colonel Allison informed
this Headquarters that action would be taken to resurvey the incident
and to accomplish photographic and earth-sample investigations of
the area in which the incident occurred.

On 21 August (Saturday) a call was received by Capt Gordon from a
Major Morgan of Gq, 5th Army, informing Capt Gordon (MCIA(X)-3) that
the incident occasioned by the missile had been covered since the
indication. Unfortunately, however, since the occurrence there had been
two or three heavy rainfalls and the depression in the ground previously
ly noted was found to be 1/3 full of water. Photographic coverage was
made, however, and samples of rocks and earth in the depression were
extracted. This evidence was being forwarded to 5th Army HQ Area as
of Tuesday the 24th and will be forwarded this office (MCIA(X)-3)
immediately upon receipt, and should arrive t/is Hq by the end of the 
week.

SUBJECT: Project "SIGN"

Gentlemen:

Accompanying this letter is a small sample of soil. The soil was taken from a depression reported to have been caused by a "flying saucer" described as being approximately two feet in diameter and one foot thick which reportedly settled gently to the ground, resounded to a height of about twenty feet and then continued on its journey. Although the density was immediately covered by a large rainfall a heavy rain subsequently filled the depression about one/half full of water before any sample of dirt could be taken.

In an effort to approach this incident objectively to determine every possible clue, it has been deemed advisable to have this soil sample analyzed and tested. In inquiry, your Dayton representative stated that the FBI Laboratory would accomplish the required tests.

It is the desire of this headquarters to ascertain, in particular, if there are traces of unusual elements or alloys adhering to the surface of the particles, or if any abnormality in structure exists showing that the soil was subjected to intense heat, gases or radioactive substances, etc. Unfortunately, in this regard, no one thought to forward a sample of the soil surrounding the depression so no comparison of soils can be made at this time. Should the subsequent tests show anything unusual some arrangement along this to obtaining some of the surrounding soil so that a comparative analysis could be made. The accompanying sample has not been tested by any other agency, nor will it be.

Examination of Soil

Examination requested by: Addressee

Reference: Letter dated September 9, 1948

Examination requested: Microscopic (Petrographic‑geologic)

Specimens: 
Q1 Sample of soil.

Results of Examination:

The sample of soil designated as specimen Q1 consisted of various sized
pebbles, sand and dirt. This material was examined for the presence of unusual
elements or alloys adhering to the surface of the particles, evidence of intense
heat and radioactive substances.

Nothing unusual was noted on the pebbles or in the sand and dirt that
would indicate a metallic object had rubbed or scraped against this sample. No
abnormality was noted in the structure of the various pebbles and rocks, nor
was there any indication of extreme heat or the presence of radioactive sub‑
stances.

The specimen designated as Q1 will be returned to your office under
separate cover by registered mail.

---

Incident No. 162 -- 11 August 1945, 1200 Hours, Hamel, Minnesota,
Two children, ages ten and eight, described a dull gray object two
feet in diameter and one foot thick, shaped like two platters face to face
which settled gently to the ground. It emitted no sound when it hovered. 
On the ground it emitted a whistling noise when it "swiftly flew"
where it hesitated, whistled once more, "shot" up to thirty feet, then 
"shot" off in a northeast direction.

ATIC Opinion: This apparent bit of fantasy is hardly worth further
consideration.

Incident #152 -- Hamel, Minnesota -- 11 August 1948

No astronomical explanation is possible for this inci-
dent. A meteorite would not have descended so gently, nor would
it have risen again.

It seems illogical that this could have been an actual
physical occurrence, out if it was, it is doubly unfortunate that
no mature observers were at hand. If the object did land just a
few foot away, one would think that even children would have given
a mere detailed description. Is it known whether the children
have normal vision? To one with myopic vision, even a buzzard or
hawk alightng to a landing might appear as a strange object.

With 124 incidents thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four
which contain some evidence but have no apparent ready explanation.
This amounts to a bare one only with a support in the evidence as
reported as reliable and convincing. These typical cases and points
might be evaluated as follows, to wit: speed; color of object; 
shaped changing object; no sound emitted; no clear exhaust trail;
pursuit of Air Material Command Representative impossible (See
Add 43).

Air Material Command Intelligence Summary (Top

There can eliminate psychological explanations for the
a majority of flying objects to provide plausible explanation
of fact of flying capabilities. Possible errors in scientific
evaluation possibly from inability to establish opposite, discern,
shape.

Informants stated that on 11 Aug 48 between 1200 and 1215 hours, CST,
____ and _______ were playing in the back yard and noticed an object 
in descent approximately twelve feet from the ground which was ascending
from the spot of that.  It settled to the ground when ____ hit a
balloon. Upon hitting the ground the object spun crazily, made a sort of 
whistling noise, described by the two boys as resembling a steam whistle,
and then shot straight up into the air approximately 20 feet, halted 
and again made a whistling noise.  The object then shot upward to a height
of about 30 feet, and, in this ascent, maneuvered around two branches
and telephone wires. Upon reaching a height of approximately 30 feet
two objects shot off in a northeasterly direction.  The object approached
from the northwest.

The boys described the object as "approximately one foot thick, two feet
wide and round."  The object had no windows, wires, or any visible 
appurtenances.  It was a dull gray in color and when it hit the ground,
it made a slight clanking noise, much as metal hitting against metal.

____ and Mrs. ______ stated the boys were visibly frightened when they
ran into the house and were afraid to tell what they had seen.  Upon
close questioning, the boys related the above story to them.

Mr. _____ advised that he then had notified Mr. R. R. Sheridan, Postmaster
at Hamel, Minnesota (who subsequently notified the proper authorities)

AGENT'S NOTES:
Agent noted that the spot where the alleged 'Flying saucer* 
had landed was approximately 2 feet in diameter and appeared as though 
some heavy object had landed there or had been set down - as the ground 
was dented and protruding rocks had been leveled.  The spot was covered by
a wildtumb.

 _______ Mr. R. R. Sheridan, Postmaster, advised that he had no 
reason to doubt the story of the boys or of Mr. and Mrs. _______ and
for this reason had reported the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
St. Paul, Minn.
