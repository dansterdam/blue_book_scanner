There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with the text "File 4079 May 1956 Boston, Massachusetts 2 photos" written at the top.

File 4079
May 1956
Boston, Massachusetts
2 photos

- page 1 -

The image shows two black and white landscape photographs. The top photograph depicts a cityscape or skyline across a body of water, likely a harbor or river. The bottom photograph shows a similar view of the cityscape, but with more details visible in the buildings and structures.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

CONFIDENTIAL
1956 - 05 - 7276710
BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - 4079
