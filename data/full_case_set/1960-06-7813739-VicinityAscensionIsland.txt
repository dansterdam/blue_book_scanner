Object was observed in immediate vicinity of recovery operation during Test 1002. Witnesses at scene level at first thought this to be plane, but as plane did not appear on radar, it was concluded that this object could not have been plane/jet i.e. had dropped any object at any time during test.
11. COMMENTS
TO scientific conclusion identity of this object with the available data. Appears to be some type of atypical phenomenon, not readily identifiable.

In answer to your questions the following is submitted:
Sea state 04 - Defines a moderately rough sea, average maximum height of waves 4 to 5 feet. 
GS - rough sea, mean average height of waves 8 to 12 feet.
Comment: I question the estimate. The cloud cover and horizon do not exist with this sea state which is generally associated with a moderately rough sea. A small boat would have a rough time of it in other of these sea states.

It appears to be a scanned page from a document, specifically a report from Project Blue Book regarding an "UNIDENTIFIED SURFACE FLARE" that was sighted during a test on June 7, 1962. The text describes the observation of a "bright surface flare" that persisted for approximately 10 seconds in the vicinity of the recovery operation during the test.

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED SURFACE FLARE
SIGHTED DURING TEST 1802 REC

Dear Sir:

A bright surface flare was observed in the immediate vicinity of the recovery operation during Test 1802. This persisted for approximately 10 seconds.

Range Controller personnel reported this to be an air-borne light dropped to a controlled illumination by a shore-based launcher at the time the Ship Operations Manager had confirmed the flare, it was too late to photograph it.

Personnel engaged in the recovery operation were unable to identify the light or its source. Statements of crewmembers who eye witnessed the occurrence are herewith submitted for your information and further pursuance.

The text in the document describes an incident report related to a "flare light sighted during data cassette recovery, test 1802" that occurred on June 28, 1960.

The text in the document is as follows:

THRU: OSWD
PAPB

DATE: 28 June 1960

SUBJ: INCIDENT REPORT: FLARE LIGHT SIGHTED DURING DATA CASSETTE RECOVERY, TEST 1802  

REF: Test 1802

During actual recovery of the data cassette on Test 1802, a bright light was sighted aboard the small recovery boat. Statements by observers who sighted the light are attached.

The undersigned was aboard ORV WHISKEY as observer and advisor for the following statements is submitted concerning my observations from the small boat at the time of sighting.

"Missile impact occurred at approximately 25/0212. The data cassette light was sighted from ORV WHISKEY at approximately 25/0115. The ORV approached to within 1 NM of the blinking light. The aircraft reported sighting the strong blinking light shortly after and orbiting the data cassette awaiting the arrival of the ORV."

"At approximately 0152 the ORV approached to within 1 NM of the blinking light." The light was gone. The small boat was launched and recovery was commenced at 25/0212. A SODAR event was coordinated with Station 12 at point of recovery.

"The SGM aboard WHISKEY was below deck maintaining communications and data cassette pickup."

"It has been established by written statements received from the A/C and visual personnel, that the aircraft did not release a flare, as light's origin was from other than test participants."

Operations Planning
Dear Sir:
In answer to your letter of 28 June 1960 regarding an unidentified flare of light observed during 1962, I would like to state the following:
While I was setting up for pictures of the small boat I saw a flare of light which to me looked like a flare from an aircraft. This light was stronger than the blue-white termination of the brightness on the cassette. It was yellowish in color. It was back of the cassette and about 2 inches off the starboard bow as we approached. The cassette was clearly visible about 15 degrees off the starboard beam the shop.
I was with the first Mate of the Ship at the time and I mentioned him and said that the A/C flare was dying out, that was we still visible for the recovery.
I thought nothing more of this, as I expected this was routine coverage, and went ahead and shot pics of the recovery. Small diagram of position I sighted the flare-----------
Sincerely yours,

The image does not contain any photographic elements. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

I was copilot of Silver One flying at 3500' MSL. Silver One 2003 MSL had contact with an object traveling above him and in a 65'- 70' state of oscillation. The object was overcast with haze and sea state of 5. The pilot and Silver One's radio operator then proceeded to position course and ELINT the object and in orbit around the object. At this time (approximately 0720Z) when the overcast broke, full Alc it is practically impossible to estimate altitude but further than 100 yards from and either on the surface or very near the surface. The flight intensity was approximately 70 minutes and the light burned for approximately 10 seconds. A immediate negative reply was received. Indicating a positive read when an object had crossed or interfered with the test. I confirmed that neither AIC had dropped any object at any time during the test.

Text in the document:

May 9, 1960

This appears to be a UFO report rather than an actual photograph. It describes an observation and provides some evaluations and determinations regarding the sighting.

1. Evaluate that what is here.
2. Determine who should review.
3. Determine whether a thorough investigation should be conducted or if the matter can be closed.
The text discusses evaluating the observation, determining who should review the case, and deciding whether a thorough investigation is needed or if the matter can be closed.
