Dear sir
This would haye been on (? or 1)18/65 at (approximately) 8pm (?) 9:15 pm, central time. The object was first seen from a distance to th northwest, about 20 degrees above the horizon. It appeared at first to be a bright star, but soon began to increase in size and brightness. As it approached Bydnor, NC, it appeared to be a large, bright, white, elliptical object, glowing brightly. It moved very slowly and silently, taking about 10 minutes to cross the sky from northwest to southeast. There were no wings or other appendages visible. The object finally disappeared below the horizon to the southeast. It was observed by 4 people, and was seen for approximately 15 minutes.

Respectfully,
[name redacted]
