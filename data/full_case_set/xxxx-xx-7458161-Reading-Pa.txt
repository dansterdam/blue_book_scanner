They is a 10:30 light. It came on and lit up the whole area. Then as it went over a hill it want out and then it came on again. This light was a round light and was a bright light. It seemed to be as large as a full moon. It went out all at once. As it want out the light made a trail and that trail was 50 to 75 feet in length. This light could have been a UFO.

NARRATIVE: The observer report forwards a narrative written and signed by and concerns his sighting of UFOs on 23 April 1967. It should be noted that this report is submitted in sub-mission to BDRM 4A3b.

COMMENTS OF REPORTING OFFICERS: A. On inquiry, it was ascertained that the witness described seeing a bright light which approached very closely. It seemed to be round and of considerable size. When it was at its closest approach, there was a brief flash similar to an explosion or brilliant flash at each change of direction. He thought that this flash was caused by some sort of connection producing an impulse or brilliance. He compared its motion to some sort of intelligent control, rapidly changing direction. B. The source stated that the witness seemed to be a mature and intelligent person, with no indication of any mental disturbance. He appeared entirely sane and sincere in his statement. Therefore, while the object itself could not be identified, the witness appears to be a credible observer who has described an unusual phenomenon in a reasonable and logical manner.

TRANSLATION OF WRITTEN NARRATIVE BY [REDACTED]
Memorandum Concerning Phenomenon Observed Sunday, 23 April 1967 At Approximately 8:50 P.M.

As I looked out the window before going to bed, I saw a bright object in the sky. At first I thought it was a star, but as I continued to watch it, I noticed that it was moving. I called to my children and to my wife to come and look at it. We all watched as it moved across the sky, faster than Venus in its most visible periods. I called to my children and to my wife to come and look at it. We all watched as it moved across the sky, faster than Venus in its most visible periods. It appeared to be very large, and at times seemed to be making strange maneuvers. At one point it appeared to stop and hover, then it moved off at a very fast speed. 

As I leaned on a fence to control my nerves, I called out to my children which normally appear, but they did not come out. I then realized that I was observing something which normally does not happen. I thought it was an optical illusion, since the other star was also moving in the same direction. On realizing this, I became alarmed and therefore, must have been moving. I called out to my children again, but they did not come. I then went into the house to get my binoculars, hoping to get a better view. The object was still visible, and through the binoculars I could see that it was definitely not an ordinary object, but a large, glowing one. (Larger than the full moon.) I realized this change of direction later; I did not stop to think about what I was observing, as I was intent on continuing my observations. I did not lose brilliance, and while I was an observing, there was no change of color or speed.

The drawing attached shows the larger star at the moment I saw multiple red lines emanating from one side and seem to be multiple kind of strange and. The line of some of these sizes, what appeared to the small rays, completely undulating as if they were creatures of extraordinary brilliance. The three white lines at this moment the clouds lifted and my wife could see the multiple red lines which I have drawn.

Suddenly, this phenomenon seemed to come from one object which moved separately in different directions, and then disappeared. Also at this time there were a number of rocket flashes at the same time.

I believe that the two objects together may have been either, but, unfortunately, I let my children use the binoculars and I told to direct their vision toward the two stars I had shown them before, as there was no time.

This is the appearance when they start moving. It could be that there was some delay in seeing the phenomenon due to my children focusing their attention, but when I regained sight, the object had changed direction.

6. PERSONNEL, ORGANIZATION OR INSTALLATION INVOLVED: N/A

7. SUMMARY: At approximately 0220 hours, 17 April 1967, I observed five (5) large, illuminated, oval shaped objects, traveling in a close formation and at a very high rate of speed. They disappeared over the roof of the Saigon Field Office of the 524th MI Detachment, located at 205/8 Vo Tanh, Saigon. Based on the size and behaviors of the objects, I estimate their altitude was approximately 1000-2000 feet. During the period of time, the objects traveled from where I first saw them and disappeared over the roof, they seemed to be at a constant height, and when they passed behind the roof, there was no change in their speed or direction. I estimate the total observation time was approximately 15-20 seconds. The objects appeared to be very bright, almost white in color. During the period of time the objects were observed, the sky was very clear, and the objects were easily visible against the night sky. As they passed over the roof, I did not observe any trail or contrail. I also observed that, as they moved, the objects maintained a constant distance from each other, and their shape and size remained the same. This indicated to me that the objects were under some form of control. I could give no estimate as to the speed of the objects, but based on the short period of time over which they were observed traversing a considerable distance, I would estimate it to be in excess of 1000 mph. During the entire period of observation, I heard no sound emanating from the objects. I have no explanation for what I observed, and it is completely outside my experience. I can offer no conclusions as to the nature of the objects.

13. COMMENT OF REPORTING AGENCY: SUMMARY (Continued):
Made no noise audible to me. Prior to the sighting of these objects, I had observered various conventional aircraft, both propeller and jet powered, and their manner of flight and performance was definitely different from these unidentified objects. I can't account for what I saw as I've ever seen in the sky. They were all travelling at a terrific rate of speed which I would estimate to be around five times greater than that of any jet powered aircraft I have ever seen. They were too distant and travelling too fast for me to be able to even estimate their size, but judging from the apparent speed, they must have been tremendous. I was only able to see them for a few seconds. They seemed to disappear suddenly in the distance. I have no opinion whatsoever concerning their identity, origin or purpose. However, I have never seen anything even remotely similar in all my experience as a flyer and aircraft observer. The performance of these objects was incredible and unconventional. So far as I am concerned these objects remain completely unexplained, and I am at a loss to account for what they could have been. There were several of them. I had a very clear and distinct view of them. They were bright, sharply outlined, and did not appear to be reflecting the sun. As I stated, they were definitely not any kind of conventional aircraft. I also noticed they disappeared suddenly, rather than gradually fading from sight. As I said, the performance and characteristics of these objects were unlike anything I have ever seen before or since, and they remain completely mysterious and unexplained to me.

Attn: Major H. Quintanilla, Jr.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

As reported, this case is completely unidentified and much criticized. Immediate disclosure would not seem appropriate. It is conceivable that military intelligence or psychological warfare might have some interest if these objects picked up by radar coverage were these. Wireless indicates that jet interception may have been involved, although objects were visual in shape and were sighted by several aircraft. In one case they are described as "surrounded by a bluish green glow, and moving at a rapid rate of speed. Their maneuvers indicated they were controlled and intelligent in flight. Attachments: It appears that all persons concerned in this sighting should be furnished interrogation. I further suggest that a copy of this sighting be transmitted to the University of Colorado group.

Since the source of this information was himself a member of a military intelligence detachment, it is current all the more significance as confirming details that would otherwise be lacking.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek

Dear [redacted],

This replies to your letter reporting your unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

However, without essential data such as angular velocity, flight characteristics, duration of the sighting, etc., a comprehensive evaluation cannot be undertaken. Also, your location was undetermined, which prevented the exact determination of the area covered by your sighting. Therefore, it was obviously not familiar to you.

We define a UFO as any aerial phenomenon or object which is unknown or the origin of which is not established to the observer's observation will be aided for identification purposes.

We would be interested in evaluating your photographs, if you will obtain the original negatives from Bell for us.

Thank you for your letter; we appreciate your interest in our project. I am attaching some reading material that I think you will find interesting.

Sincerely,

Dear Sirs:

I would like to report a UFO sighting. We were driving to grand field-target shooting vicinity on April 17, 1954. At approximately 10:30 PM, on a clearnight sky, my wife and I saw this black, egg-shaped object fall from the sky, and hit the Ground near the river, and it then continued on along the bank for about 30 yards and then lift off again. I then followed it on my car for 3 or 4 miles until it went out of sight. The object appeared to be about 750 feet long, oval shaped, and passed less than 100 feet over our car traveling at a very high rate of speed. We saw no visible means of propulsion, just silence. I would like to get this on record to your department. Please advise.

Sincerely,

SHARON POLICE DEPT ADDENDUM IV
Date - April 20, 1966
Officer's Report:
At 10:32 P.M. I received a telephone call requesting assistance in the investigation of a UFO sighting. Officers Jones and I responded to Holly Lane. On arrival we found Officer Patton and Sgt. Donovan observing distant lights in the sky. Mrs. Mar and Mrs. Jones also were observing distant lights about 12:10 a.m. - 12:50 a.m. Donovan and Officer Jones left and Officer Jones and myself watched the distant lights with the mrs. One of these objects was in a south westerly direction, appeared to be rotating and changing colors from red to white to red. This was two other objects of the same description in a south westerly direction. While we were observing these distant lights, Mrs. Mar said here it comes, or there it is, and we all looked in the direction she indicated. We observed to be a falling star-like object, only three times the size of a star and traveling at a much faster rate. This object disappeared below the horizon. Only three times did the size of the object appear to change as it was crossing the sky from west to east. The object made no noise what-so-ever, and did not cast any glow, and moved over the tree line for approximately 500 yards where I lost sight of it. At one point when the object was hovering, it appeared to be a very bright, large mass of white light with a brilliant appearance. The object made no noise what-so-ever, and did not cast any glow, and hovered over the tree line for approximately two or three minutes. While the object was hovering a plane message over it in a northerly direction, when the plane moved off the object started to move across the field in a south westerly direction. As the object started to move, it appeared to be a red light and a wide section of white light extending from red light to red light and appeared to be inside the object. But I failed to detect any sign of movement but failed to detect any sign of movement but failed to detect any form of aerodynam-ics as I did see inside the object. The object did not appear to rotate as it went over the tree line in a south westerly direction.

THE TEXT CONTENT OF THE DOCUMENT IS:

- UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
- NOVEMBER 16, 1951
- READING, PENNSYLVANIA
- AIRCRAFT OBSERVER REPORT
- PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION 
- The weather conditions were generally clear and calm. Visibility was good. The observer reported that he saw a bright light moving slowly across the sky from the northwest to the southeast. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was observed for about 10-15 minutes before going out of sight.
- The observer stated that the object appeared to be about the size of a basketball at arm's length and was a bright white in color. It was moving at a slow and steady rate, approximately the speed of a slow moving airplane.
- The observer, who was an aircraft mechanic, felt that the object was not an airplane, helicopter, or any known type of aircraft. He stated that he had never seen anything like it before.
- INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS: The observer appears to be a reliable source. His description of the object does not match any known aircraft in our inventory. Further investigation is warranted.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

"Additional Information

A survey of the area around the key property was made on April 22nd, 1952, by Capt. Ralph S. Mayhill. The surrounding fields are very low, and the terrain is generally flat. It is between 3 and 4 miles from the nearest town, Reading, Pa. The only buildings in the immediate vicinity are a few farm houses.

The object was first sighted by Mr. Hubert L. Heckert, who lives on the Stettler property. He was feeding his cows about 6:30 p.m. on April 22nd, 1952, when he noticed the object in the sky. At first he thought it was an aircraft, but after watching it for a short time he realized it was not an aircraft, as it was hovering and making no sound. He called his wife and son to observe the object. They watched it for about 10 minutes, during which time it did not move from its position. It then suddenly shot straight up into the sky and disappeared. Witnesses described the object as being silver in color, round in shape, and about the size of a "basketball" at arm's length. They also stated that it gave off a dull glow.

The Witnesses:
Hubert L. Heckert
Age: 46
Occupation: Farmer
Address: Stettler property, Reading, Pa. 
Ethel Heckert (wife)
Age: 44
Occupation: Housewife
Address: Stettler property, Reading, Pa.

The Air Force report concluded that the object was a reflection of the sun on a weather balloon. The Chief has directed that no further investigation is necessary on this case."

Text in the document:

These sightings constituted and it is believed an important part of the official report made by the Army Air Force Intelligence regarding the so-called "flying discs" which had appeared first in the summer of 1947 and had caused considerable interest and speculation throughout the country. In the opinion of the investigators these objects were considered to be of a very high order of scientific development and exhibited characteristics which could not be duplicated by any known aircraft. The investigation of these sightings was conducted by the Intelligence Branch of the Army Air Force and the results were forwarded to Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, where they became part of the official files of Project "Blue Book" which was the code name for the Air Force's official investigation of "flying disc" sightings. The sightings herein reported were part of those official files.

About 8:15 - P.M. Dec 9th 1949
My husband and I were coming home and we saw something that looked like a large round object diving, and it came nearer and nearer us and lit up brighter and brighter and was a very bright red light on the object. It looked rather strange and about the size of a small airplane and it seemed to stand still for a few minutes like it was searching or something. It looked rather unusual and unlike anything I'd ever seen. It looked like a big red light and like it might be some kind of flying object. It looked rather strange and like it might be a flying saucer. We looked rather while and like it had stopped and just hung there in mid air, and then it suddenly started off again and went across the sky and disappeared. I was rather surprised and puzzled and rather frightened to see it, as I'd never seen anything like it before.

A bright red light on the sight on the object on the back, banking or swerving on and off and a sort of yellow light or left side. We watched it for about ten minutes or a little more. It was headed in the southward direction as far as I could tell.

Coming your Air Force career I had a strange experience. I was almost certain at the time that I had seen an unidentified flying object, or UFO, as we called them. This occurred at approximately 11:50 P.M. on September 19, 1957 while I was stationed at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. The weather was clear, very little wind, and visibility good. I observed a strange luminous object in the sky which appeared to be hovering for approximately 10-15 minutes. It was shaped like a crescent, casting a soft blue-green glow. After hovering for a while, it started moving swiftly horizontally and then suddenly shot straight up and disappeared from sight. I radioed the control tower on the base and was informed that they had received no other reports of any unusual sightings at that time. I have not had any other sightings since then. This is the only UFO experience I have ever had. I would be interested in any information your office can provide me on this incident. Thank you for your consideration.

DRAFT

SAF-OICO/MISS Turnure/76526/July 29, 1968

Dear 

Your recent letter to President Johnson concerning your sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) has been referred to this office.

Unfortunately, you did not report your sighting soon enough so that a detailed investigation can be made. We have found that after thirty (30) days, precise details tend to become vague, and an investigation would serve little scientific or technical purpose.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force base. Each base in the United States has a UFO investigator, who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation, which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

We are, however, including a copy of the latest Project Blue Book report. By reading it, you may be able to discover what it was that you observed.

Sincerely,

Attachment:

As I was driving southeast toward Reading, Pennsylvania on Route 54, 5:45 P.M. on April 23, 1957, an extremely fast moving light caught my eye. It hadn't been there a second before. It was moving two or three times the speed of a conventional jet), I grabbed the steering wheel to keep from veering off the road. It was nearly overhead and gone in a matter of seconds. It appeared to be a very bright light (four or five times as bright as a full moon) and the edges were indistinct, as if glowing. It was in sight for no more than one minute. I wanted to get a better look but it went by so fast I couldn't. The object was very bright (four or five times as bright as a full moon) and the edges were indistinct, as if glowing. It was in sight for no more than one minute. I wanted to get a better look but it went by so fast I couldn't. The object seemed to be self-luminous. It was in the air, not attached to anything. It was moving southeast toward Reading in the same direction I was traveling. I was alone in the car. I can't judge the size or altitude because of the speed and lack of reference points. It appeared higher than 10,000 feet but I have no way of knowing for sure. I recall that the time was just about 5:45 PM and I had just left Reading, Pennsylvania, traveling southeast on Route 54 when I sighted the object. I was on my way home to Shillington, Pennsylvania. My son then went out to observe the sky. Several sightings were made in that general area at about that time. I also used that Form as a report to the Project Blue Book (Aerial Sightings). I want to state that it had inquired to me that it had inquired to me that no report of any kind had been made sooner because of the time lapse; the object might not be identified. I was given this report and at the same time stated that because of the time lapse, the object might not be identifiable.

The text in the document is as follows:

SIGHTING ACCOUNT

The sighting started about 9:00 PM PST, Friday, 4/22/66. As the witness, Miss XXXXX XXXXX, was driving slowly northward on Boyertown Road, just north of Reading, Pa., she noticed a very large, bright object in the sky ahead of her car. The object was stationary and appeared to be resting on the ground at a slight distance ahead of her position. She continued driving toward the object, and as she approached it, the object lifted up slowly off the ground and started moving slowly in a northerly direction at a height of about 40-50 ft. above the road. As the object moved, she drove under it and was able to observe it closely. She described it as being about 40-50 ft. in diameter, round in shape, and having bright, flashing lights around its perimeter. The flashing lights were of a blue-green color. The object moved slowly northward for about 1/2 mile, then it suddenly increased its speed and accelerated rapidly out of sight to the north.

However, the witness was certain that what she saw was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other type of conventional aircraft. She believed that what she observed was some type of unidentified flying object.

The sighting lasted for a total of about 3-4 minutes. The witness was quite shaken and upset by the experience.

OBSERVED A LIGHTED OBJECT IN THE SKY. IT APPEARED TO BE OBLONG IN SHAPE AND LIGHTED UP ABOUT 10 FEET FROM THE GROUND. IT MADE NO SOUND AND HOVERED ABOUT 50 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND THEN JUST TOOK OFF AT A
HIGH RATE OF SPEED. I WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES. IT WAS GOING SO FAST THAT I COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH IT IN MY CAR.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

CASE BACKGROUND:

The witness, whose identity cannot be revealed due to privacy concerns, reported observing an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the sky over Reading, Pennsylvania on [REDACTED] at approximately [REDACTED] hours. The witness described the object as a disc-shaped craft, hovering and maneuvering in the air before suddenly accelerating and disappearing from view.

INVESTIGATION:

The report was filed with Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official program for investigating UFO sightings. Investigators were dispatched to the location to gather further information and evidence. The witness was interviewed, and their account of the event was documented.

No physical evidence, such as debris or landing marks, was found at the site. However, the witness provided a rough sketch of the object they had observed, which has been included in the case file.

CONCLUSION:

Based on the available information, this incident remains classified as an "unidentified" under Project Blue Book's guidelines. The case has been thoroughly investigated, but no definitive explanation for the observed phenomenon has been determined. The Air Force has concluded that further investigation is not warranted at this time.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from George P. Freeman, Jr., Lt. Colonel, USAF, Chief, Civil Branch, Community Relations Division, Office of Information, responding to a letter reporting an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting on April 22.

The text of the letter is as follows:

SAFOTCG/mrs Cassel/jad/72079/8 May 67

MAY 8 1967

Dear Mr. Cassel:

This replies to your letter reporting the April 22 unidentified flying object (UFO) sighted by you and your friends.

However, without essential data such as angular velocity, flight characteristics, duration of the sighting, etc., it is impossible for me to analyze and evaluate the data. Nor can I determine the time and location of your sighting. I don't know what it was you saw - it may or may not have been a UFO as any aerial phenomenon or object within the atmosphere can be classified as such according to the ordinary usage of the term.

Thank you for your letter; we appreciate your interest in our program. I have attached some reading material which I think you will find interesting.

Sincerely,

GEORGE P. FREEMAN, JR.
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
