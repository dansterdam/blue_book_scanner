The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with a handwritten questionnaire.

Try to remember the exact time you sighted the object?
How high was it the first time you sighted it?
The duration of time you saw the object?
The direction in which it came from?
The color, whether it made any sound, and the direction?
Try to estimate the size of the object.
Remember as much as you can about the weather conditions and the exact place where you made the sighting.
Try to get some accurate estimate of your own emotional state of the time.
Did you see any additional information that you would consider confirming this object on television or in the newspapers?

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document with a series of numbered points and some redacted text. 

Here is the transcription of the text in the document:

1. It is only about 250
2. About 30 or 38 feet long. Whitish. 
3. White light on front and back, constantly rotating. 
4. Not too loud. 
5. It hovered & then suddenly shot up & out of sight.
6. And they made no sound when they moved.
