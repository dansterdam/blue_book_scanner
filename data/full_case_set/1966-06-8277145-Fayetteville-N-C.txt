(Circle One): Yes No (Don't Know) IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of: Night was clear.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - NO
b. Color - Yellow, similar to a star.

18. We wish to know the angular size: Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? 
Covered completely by a match head at arm's length.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object they you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
1st sighting - Dome light 
2nd - 5th sightings - Star like

The image contains a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photographs, but instead contains several sketches and diagrams, as well as text describing various instructions and questions.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass to show the direction from which you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass to show the direction in which you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling. The first observation was one sight above the other moving parallel to ground. 2nd - 2nd single lights moving in straightflight straight parallel to the ground.
