1. We have received a letter from Mr. -- regarding an observation on the night of 6 Sep 1965. The following information is provided:  

2. The description of multiple lights is similar to an observation provided from the New England area to the "speedway" (refueling area) near Center, Indiana. This involved a flight of approximately 12 objects described as moving with a "jerking" motion. The observer reported that they were over western New York at the time of the report. The information provided in his letter was not included in the original letter. The weather included a mist or drizzle and high winds which could have been condition to attribute the sighting to the refueling operation on the limited data presented. However, the description is similar to a report with a Form 16* he sent to Mr. -- which he feels is not a plausible explanation.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Dear Sir:
During the recent investigation of your report of an unidentified aerial object observed on September 8, 1965, near Leon, New York, the following information was obtained.

The object was comparatively stationary and at an altitude of between 1000 and 2000 feet. It was a fairly-round whitish-yellow color, with a diameter of about 40-50 feet. The object remained in view for about 10-15 minutes before moving rapidly to the northeast and disappearing from sight.

Mr. Walter Brindle, a member of the board of directors of the Chautauqua County UFO Research Group, and a number of other persons also observed the object. We were giving this matter a detailed investigation as it had the appearance of an unidentified aerial phenomenon.

While beginning to form an estimate of the sighting, the subject became one of greater importance when Mr. Brindle advised that on the following day, September 9, 1965, between approximately 11:00 AM and 12:00 noon, he and approximately ten other persons again observed a similar object in the same general area. This sighting reportedly lasted for about 20-30 minutes.

Inasmuch as this case involves a rather lengthy investigation and analysis, I have taken the liberty of preparing the enclosed report to provide you with a summary of the details developed to date.

Please advise if you have any additional information or comments regarding this matter.

Sincerely,
Phillip J. Klass
Investigations Consultant

From the object a small dimension was seen, distinctly moving and described as brilliantly lighted. It appeared no more than a half a mile distant and lasted for 3-5 minutes. Called and also saw the object in question. The hangar commander (...)
