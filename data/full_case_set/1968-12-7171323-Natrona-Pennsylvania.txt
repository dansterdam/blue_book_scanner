TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS ABOUT AS MUCH AS WE CAN EXPECT TO GAIN FROM THE AVERAGE SIGHTING AND OBSERVATION OF A UFO EVENT. SUCH AS A VISUAL SIGHTING LASTING FROM 5 TO 30 SECONDS, FROM WHICH NO PHOTOGRAPH OR OTHER CONCRETE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE IS OBTAINED. WE MUST BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH FIRST-HAND ACCOUNTS AND DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE MOST PART, SINCE THE VAST MAJORITY OF UFO EVENTS GO UNRECORDED AND UNDOCUMENTED.
