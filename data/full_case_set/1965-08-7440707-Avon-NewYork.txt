CONCLUSION: Other (INTERPRETATION OF CONVENTIONAL OBJECTS)
BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Observers saw a bright light and several small lights around it. They saw the same lights at the same time and the same place on several following nights. Also saw a bright red light gliding silently across the sky. It disappeared behind a tree.

Although the data is insufficient, there is no need to follow up because it is quite obvious that the objects were stars and aircraft. Therefore this case is carried under Other (Misinterpretation of Conventional Objects).
