WASHINGTON, D.C.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

1 Jun 1969

Dear
This replies to your letter postmarked June 27, in which you requested evaluation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

In order for Project Blue Book to investigate a UFO sighting, the observer must report it directly to the Air Force. We do not accept secondhand reports for investigation. In addition, we cannot furnish a written copy of the over thirty days old, precise details which become blurred in the viewer's mind and an investigation is not then possible. However, there seems to be some confusion over the basic purpose and limitations of Project Blue Book. We thought that perhaps he might want to recheck his report since it does not meet the technical requirements as laid down in the regulations. If the sighting was reported as an UFO, you may be able to help him identify his sighting.

The 1969 Project Blue Book has not been published. However, we are unable to disclose in the 1969 statistics except in the statistical summary. You may bring your 1968 edition up-to-date by inserting the included sheets at pages 3 and 9.

The report of your sighting is being sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. As soon as it is evaluated, you will be notified.

Sincerely,

JAMES H. AIRMAN
Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Civil Branch

UFO Observation, 26 Jun 1969

Reference your UFO sighting of 26 Jun 69. On the basis of description, we feel that the stimulus for your sighting was probably a satellite. (These are over 1/100 objects in space.) Although we are unable to identify which object you sighted, we feel that your sighting was of one of these "man-made eye" satellites.

Transcription of the text in the document:

AFR 80-17(C1)
"IF AN OBJECT IS NOT STATIONARY, PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS ROSE, PLACE AN ARROW ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO WHICH THE OBJECT IS MOVING. IF A CHANGE IN POSITION SHOULD LATER BE SEEN, PLACE A Y AT THAT POINT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE CHANGE IN DIRECTION."

"IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE OBJECT WHEN FIRST SEEN AND A Y AT THE POSITION OF THE OBJECT WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE X AND Y WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE TAKEN. IF THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG, REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH."
