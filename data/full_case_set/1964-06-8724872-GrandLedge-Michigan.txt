CASE UNKNOWN
CASE HISTORY: On 8 June 1964, this office received a letter from a citizen of Grand Ledge, Michigan, reporting a sighting of an unidentified flying object. The witness stated that at approximately 2345 hours on 4 June 1964, he and his wife observed an object in the sky which appeared to be glowing and making a humming sound. The object was described as being circular in shape and about 30-40 feet in diameter. It was observed for approximately 10 minutes before it disappeared from view. The witness expressed the opinion that the object was possibly a UFO.

Nature of Complaint: UFO
DATE: 5-27-64 
OFFICER: Clemmons
ACTION: (See milo North of S. Rapids) TX 6552-6.1 miles away 6:52 PM. Subject reported that for the past 45 minutes she had observed a flashing light suspended in the sky which seemed to move from one area to another. It appeared to be either reddish or whitish in color and seemed to move up and down and from side to side but would not travel from one area to another for long periods of time. Then, it would suddenly move rapidly to another area and stop again.
6-8-64 Grimstead
A man by name Grimstead about 65 years old observed the object in the sky on the night of 5-27-64 from approximately 7:00 PM until 7:15 PM. He described the object as round or circular in shape, approximately 15-20 feet in diameter, glowing with a reddish-orange color. It appeared to be hovering in the sky and at times seemed to oscillate or wobble slightly from side to side. It then accelerated at a very rapid rate and disappeared from sight in a southerly direction.

GRAND LEDGE, MICHIGAN
8 June 1964
1. GENERAL:
On 8 June 1964, this office received a telephone call from Mr. Donald XXXXXXXX, Route 1, Box 24, Grand Ledge, Michigan, telephone number XXXXX, reporting a sighting of an unidentified flying object.
2. DETAILS OF SIGHTING:
Mr. XXXXXXXX stated that at approximately 0300 hours on 8 June 1964, he was awakened by a bright light outside his home. Upon looking out, he observed a bright, oval-shaped object about 50 feet in diameter hovering approximately 500 feet above the ground. The object was bright white in color and emitted a low humming sound. It remained in the same position for approximately 5 minutes, then suddenly accelerated in a northeasterly direction and disappeared from sight.
3. EVALUATION:
Based on the details provided by the witness, this sighting is considered to be of an unidentified flying object. No further investigation is planned.

Subsequent to their observation they had received numerous telephone calls from others who either confirmed or heard the same or a similar object. These included children who observed the object. A local sheriff who saw the object confirmed its description from a distance.

The report states that a local doctor, who was contacted, said that the object appeared to be white and had a reddish tinge. It is also noted that Mrs. --- had a child a few months old but this did not disturb the sleeping child. Also, no lights were seen and it is assumed to a be a fire.

The report then describes an interview with Estaing R. Dunckhorst, who with Mr. and Mrs. ----- proceeded to the Delta Township Fire Barn Station at Grand Ledge, Michigan for an interview. The object was described as hovering over the yard and then ascending vertically at a high rate of speed. The object was in sight for only a few seconds and could not be seen after that. 

The report mentions that there was no estimation on the altitude of the object, and that it appeared to be about 40 to 50 feet in diameter. The noise and brightness caused concern that the object might become a hazard or cause a disturbance, but it passed without incident.

Text output from the document:

to Baskiny Highway. As they turned onto the road from the driveway both girls observed a light which they thought to be a car coming towards them. However, as the car approached the light stopped. They then observed that a car following them had stopped. Of particular interest was the description of the light which was stated to be a glow on nearby trees. Total duration of the observation was about 5 minutes.

The light did not cast a glow on nearby trees. The initial portion of the light was seen to be brighter than the glow on nearby objects. The intense portion of the light lasted about 3-4 seconds, staying dimmed and one second getting brighter again. After this, the light diminished rather rapidly completely. The witness stated it frightened the girls and they went home and reported what they had observed to their parents. Interviews with the witnesses and others present were conducted by the investigator. It was determined that a small body of water, a water tower was about 1/4 mile from the location. Measurements of the distance were measured from the roadway to the water tower and it was determined to be 1200 feet. Height of the light was estimated to be 75 to 100 feet above the ground when first observed and when it stopped. Measurements of the distance that the car lights traveled from the first appearance of the light to where it stopped were about 500 feet.

INVESTIGATIVE INFORMATION

Regarding the Grand Ledge sighting of 6 May 1964 at Capital City Airport and Landing, Michigan. The Centec press release via Lansing Police Service was informed that no night missions were being flown locally during the period of observation.

The FAA was contacted regarding local flights on the night of 6 May 1964 and information from their records indicating operations in the area at that time were being coordinated. Twin engine aircraft were scheduled for night flights. These planes did not fly during the period in question. Their flights were scheduled for the remainder of the night.

I MUST APOLOGIZE FOR NOT WRITING SOONER. I HAVE BEEN SO BUSY THAT I HAVE JUST NOT HAD A CHANCE TO WRITE TO YOU ABOUT YOUR SIGHTING.

YOUR SIGHTING WAS SO INTRIGUING THAT I MUST SURELY OWE YOU SOME EXPLANATION. REGARDING SUCH SIGHTINGS I OBTAINED THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF THE SIGHTING WITH YOU I OBTAINED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:

ESSENTIALLY, THE REASON FOR THIS SIGHTING IS AS FOLLOWS: WHILE IT SEEMS TO REPRESENT A VERY UNUSUAL PHENOMENON, IT MUST BE EXPLAINED IN NATURAL TERMS. ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT IT WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY SWAMP GAS OR SOME SUCH NATURAL PHENOMENON.

YOUR CAR FROM THE DRIVEWAY INTO THE ROAD AND THE LIGHTS STOPPED UPON A BRANCH OR POWER LINE OR SOMETHING SIMILAR. WHEN YOUR CAR MOVED, THE LIGHTS DISAPPEARED. IT WOULD NATURALLY BE THAT OF A CAR COMING TOWARD YOU DOWN THE ROAD. HOWEVER, A CLOSER EXAMINATION WOULD SHOW IT WAS (SIMPLY) YOUR OWN CAR AND LIGHTS.

I HOPE THAT THIS EXPLANATION IS SATISFACTORY AND THAT THE WEATHER WOULD NOT CHANGE BUT WOULD REMAIN THE SAME. I WAS SO LONG AGO THE SAME.

SINCERELY YOURS,
[REDACTED]

It was learned that the FAA in Lansing turned over control of flight control station on 25 June between 0300 and 0300 for a classified military operation. Roger Snowberger was the tower operator and was interviewed the following afternoon at 1500 when he came on duty.

Discussion with the tower operators James A Mackey on UFO's and the messages in the area revealed that many calls are received by the tower operators, normally explaining the observation of strange objects in the sky, some of which are said to be saucers or planets. The tower at Capitol City Airport has an unobstructed view of the entire area.

On 13 June, 1964, at about 2215 hours, in Grand Ledge, Michigan, a group of people were having a party. During the party, Miss [redacted] was driving with Miss [redacted] beside her in the front seat. The car had just pulled out of the driveway and was about to head north towards Saginaw Highway, between Grand Ledge and Lansing. There was a very bright light coming from the front seat. The light came closer, and it was apparent that it was not a car, but a large glowing shape which filled the road from side to side. Miss [redacted] saw the object had a very white light for a few seconds, dimmed considerably, but almost immediately rose again to maximum brightness for several seconds. It then disappeared, without moving. While it was there, the girls could not see the road ahead, and could not determine if it was cars or cars passing by on Saginaw Road through the small opening. Investigators visited the scene with the girls and Miss [redacted] parents. The girls showed where several of the boys from the party had looked for the object, but they had not seen anything. The place where the car was stopped, the headlights on Joy Road (as seen on the road about 100 feet in front of the car) gave a clear indication of where the object had been seen.

Investigators found no traces of anything unusual on the road over a distance of about 0.2 miles. There were some faint impressions from however. The area where a car's tire had gone and some loose dirt (this area was not paved). This tire-mark may have been what the car's tires, or may have been made by their own car as they returned south on the road. The investigators did not notice anything unusual standing just beyond the dense brushed lining both sides of the road, on the south side. Nearby, the spot where the object was supposed to have across the road and might have been illuminated by reflection from the headlights. The shape of the object, from before the field trip to the location, corresponded to what can be seen under the bushes but anything beyond and larger than this space, such as a drifting cloud of fog, would, of course, take on the shape of the opening, flat on the bottom and a slightly flattened dome on top. It appears to experiment with headlights on any 702 that might appear, or at least determine if fog does arise shortly after dark.

Extracted text from the document:

"A description of coming toward you when in reality it was stationary. When the object first appeared, the light now had a constant variation in intensity that seemed to be coming from the object. The light would vary in intensity from a bright orange glow to a dull red and the decreased intensity was noticeable even from a distance of your eye to the object. There were no blinking or flashing lights on the object and there was no noise associated with the object. A.E.C. believes that the flashing was not produced by the object itself but rather by natural conditions. A.30. The illumination of the lights occurred within seconds and remained constant for the duration of the observation which was 15-20 minutes. During this time, the lights did not appear to be connected to any solid structure but rather gave the impression of a very luminous gas or vapor. A.31. The amount of light emitted was tremendous and came up by an increase in its thickness just about as observed (increase in brightness is the amount of for and an increase in its thickness just about as observed [increase in brightness is in the amount of for and an increase in its thickness lust for a brief time). Weather conditions were discussed at length with Major Hill, who verified that the observation was made under near ideal conditions for such an event to occur.

In addition to the weather conditions and location of the event, the following details are in accord with this theory:

1. Patch of light conforming with the opening in the road.
2. Brief duration of sighting.
3. Light colored (a light colored gravel which would produce a light color when illuminated.
4. Height and distance consistent with the terrain."

- page 23 -

The image contains a typed document that appears to be part of a UFO report from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present in this particular page.

The text of the document is as follows:

"The apparent approach of the light being attributed to a maneuver of some sort.
The approach of the light stopping when the car was discovered stationary and the lights continuing just prior to its disappearance.

We can find no evidence to think that this was not the case. During our brief visit to Lansing we interviewed more than twenty witnesses in connection with this sighting. They all confirmed the details of the incident as reported by the occupants of the car. In our opinion there is no reason to doubt the basic accuracy of the information given. 

When a sighting of this nature is reported, there are sometimes conditions surrounding the observation which might shed additional light on what has been seen. In this case, all of the witnesses confirmed the basic observation - that a bright light was seen approaching and then stopping, at which time the light went out. Beyond this, the witnesses could add little to explain the nature of the object which they had sighted. This is particularly true when, as often happens, the light is observed for only a brief period of time and then disappears.

When we find the only visible sign of a sighting is a light in the sky, we are usually left with the impression that this was a very puzzling and perplexing observation. I wish that I could confirm to you more conclusive evidence in the way of physical clues to the nature of this sighting, but the testimony which reached us during our investigation of your report supports only those details which you have provided.

Sincerely,

DAVID J. MOODY
