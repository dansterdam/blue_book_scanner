UNUSUAL PHENOMENON REPORT

1. INTENSE BRIGHT LIGHT OBSERVED AT 0711152 THOUGHT THAT FLARE HAD BEEN SITED BUILDING AND LIGHTED THE AREA TO THE EAST AS THE LIGHT WAS SO INTENSE. AS THE LIGHT FADED IT WAS OBSERVED TO BE RISING AND CLIMBING AT AN EXTREMELY RAPID RATE. IT WAS VERY SMALL IN SIZE AND APPEARED TO BE SEVERAL SMALLER LIGHTS TRAILING BEHIND IT. THE ENTIRE OCCURRENCE LASTED APPROXIMATELY 10 SECONDS. 

2. AT THIS TIME SEVERAL OTHER PERSONS OBSERVED THE OBJECTS TRAVELING FROM THE WEST - SOUTH - WEST TO EAST-NORTH-EAST. EACH TIME LIGHTS MAINTAINED THEIR RELATIVE POSITION UNTIL THEY DISAPPEARED INTO THE DISTANCE. 

3. AT APPROXIMATELY 7 TO 10 DEGREES ELEVATION THERE WAS BRILLIANT FLASHING LIGHTS THAT APPEARED THIS IS THE BEST AND MOST ACCURATE DESCRIPTION THAT COULD BE GIVEN. LIGHTS WERE VISIBLE AND DISAPPEARED AT THE HORIZON.

4. PHOTOS THAT THE LIGHTS ARE RECORDED ON THE SKY CAMERA WILL BE DEVELOPED ASAP.

Text from the document:

ON 7 July at 07/1156 an intense light was observed at Hallett Station. This light was first observed from the roof of a building and the Commanding Officer reported that the light was brighter than flares or illumination rockets being used for nightly observations. As the light moved over the station it was noted that there were two smaller lights trailing behind it and that the light appeared to have a reddish-orange glow. The relative position throughout the sighting was along with the upper air navigation lights. There was no apparent sound associated with the object and the direction of travel was from east to west. The sighting lasted 10-12 seconds.

Apparent brilliance rules out stars, planets, etc. The duration of the sighting precludes the possibility of a meteor or an aircraft flying across the sky. Since the object was observed by at least two independent observers, and the relative position and direction of travel was consistent, the probability of a positive identification as the object described is high. A tentative astronomical identification as a meteor is possible, but the duration, reddish-orange glow, and multiple lights are not typical of meteor sightings. The size, relative position, and time of observation could indicate a connection with aerial illumination activities, but the reddish-orange glow and multiple lights are not typical of such activities. This sighting, therefore, remains unidentified. No photograph was obtained. (Weather was reported as clear).

OCR output:
It is concluded that a fireball and the trail it generated produced the observed brilliant light at Hallett Station on 27 July 1962 at 11:52 as intense as day light was observed. The objects observed were compared to previous known events and it was confirmed that they gave the characteristics of a fireball as a meteorological phenomena. The report stated that the light was as intense as daytime and when investigated it was found that no source of radiation was detected. Subsequently they inspected the area and they indicated the same relative position through where the object was reported to have passed. They believe the trail was caused by the solid matter generating ion trail through the atmosphere and they indicated the trail persisted long enough to make observation possible by the naked eye. The fireball was of a brilliant flash and disappeared within a few seconds, usually a whistling, rumbling or series of explosions will accompany such an event. The observers noted any sound associated with the object which they distinctly did not hear. The witnesses were at a distance of 1/2 to 1 mile from the event and their description coincides with the known characteristics of a bolide which produces the observed phenomena with great intensity and brilliance within the general pattern of the visible spectrum. It generated a trail of illumination which was described as emitting a brilliant flash and disappeared within a few seconds.

The provided image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing a UFO sighting at Hallett Station in Antarctica on June 7, 1962.

The text in the document reads as follows:

"TD-2/Lt Col Friend
Unidentified Flying Objects Sighted in the Antarctic

TO-8: NAFE-28-62 (Major Hart)
Washington 25 D.C.

On 7 June 1962 at 0105Z witnesses at Hallett Station, TG-2, TO-50 I observed an object which they described as brighter than a star and which remained in view for about 20 minutes. The object was sighted on a true bearing of approximately 010 and the object was observed for more than 8 minutes. It appeared to be approximately 10Â° and the object was observed to be a steady white light in the atmosphere. The reported size of the object and the duration of its observation are very unusual for this area."
