CASE #3 (contd)

At 0031Z an F-94 was airborne on a scramble and was requested to search to the NE
of Haneda AFB over Tokyo Bay. They could make no visual observations, but could see the North Star and Venus. The F-94 was vectored to the object by GCI (both the F-94 and object were on the scope) and held it for 90 seconds. Shortly after this, both the object and the F-94 disappeared into the ground clutter on the GCI. At no time did the F-94 make visual contact. The radar contact indicated the target was at 5000 yards, 10° below and to the right of a 320° bearing from the station. Soon after loss of radar contact, the object was lost visually.

Comment

The F-94 crew reported excellent visibility, yet they could not visually observe the object during a thorough search of the area. They stated that the moon was bright and might possibly have caused reflections off the few scattered clouds. This, however, is not in agreement with the description of an exceptionally bright light given by the tower operators.

Since the weather was not given, it is not possible to determine whether the radar return was caused by some type of anomalous propagation.

Conclusion

5 August 1952                Haneda AFB, Japan
Description of Incident

The object was first noticed by two airmen walking across the ramp at Haneda AFB on the night of 5 Aug 52 at 23301 (local time). The airmen were on their way to the tower to relieve the operators. On reporting to the tower, the object was called to the attention of the tower operators who were going off duty.

The four operators agreed that the object, which they observed for from 50 minutes to an hour through 7x50 binoculars, was circular in shape and with constant brilliance. The light appeared to be a portion of a large, round, dark shape which was about 4 times the diameter of the light. When the object was close enough for details to be seen, a smaller, less brilliant light could be seen along the lower edge of the dark shape. The object faded to the east twice but reappeared; it could have faded or actually gone away and came back. The size of the light, when closest to the tower, was approximately the same as the ceiling balloons that are released near the tower. A comparison was made to those 24' diameter balloons at 2000'. This would make the object 50' in diameter at 10 miles. During the observation, a lighted balloon was released but this light was extremely dim and yellow compared to the object.

An airborne C-54 was requested to check the object, which the pilot did, but he reported seeing only a star.

An AC&W unit was notified soon after the original visual sighting and shortly after 2347 picked up an unidentified return. The object was tracked at varying speeds from hovering to 300 knots. At 0012Z the return "broke into three pieces" and they maintained intervals of 1/4 mile. No visual observation was made from the AC&W unit although it was attempted and, at one time, the object was within 10 miles of the station. The radar was directed onto the target by visual observations from the tower. So it can clearly be assumed that both visual and radar contacts involved the same object.

INCIDENT NO. 5—Shortly before midnight on August 5,
1952, two airmen were walking toward the tower at Haneda
AFB in Japan to begin their shift when they spotted a large,
round object bearing a light in the sky. Hurrying to the tower,
they pointed it out to the other tower occupants, and they took
turns observing the object through 7x50 binoculars. Under ob-
-servation, a less brilliant light could be seen around the edge of
the object. The tower people called radar and gave them a
bearing on the thing, and radar picked up a target in the im-
mediate area. By correlating movement of the radar target and
the visual UFO, they established that they were both observing
the same object. The radar tracked the object at speeds varying
from hovering to 300 knots. An F-94 was scrambled and vectored
into the target. It got into a radar lock-on and started to close on
the object. At 6,000 yards, the jet radar contact, and at the
same time the tower and ground radar lost it, too. At a second
sighting, the object as seen on the ground radar broke
up into three pieces which flew formation at quarter-mile in-
tervals. During the incident, a weather balloon was released
at the base, and the witnesses reported that its flight was much
different than that of the UFO. One of the puzzling aspects of
the incident was that neither the jet pilot nor the radar crew
was able to get a visual sighting of the object, although each
was closer to it than the air base tower.

Statement of 1st Lt G. S. Day ADCC Controller at Johnson A/R,

At 2355T on 5 Aug 52, I scrambled one (1) F-94 alert aircraft to attempt to intercept and identify an unidentified aircraft or aerial object, reported to this ADCC through Shiroi GCI from visual sighting reports by Haneda tower operators. At report of progress of intercept came into ADCC, I logged this time. when recording of all reports was made, but due to conditions of communications and recorder, this recording is unreadable. My contacts were all made with Lt Albert, duty controller at the Shiroi GCI section, who was controlling the F-94.

The F-94 was unable to close on the unidentified aircraft or object, after positive one radar contact on its reported location; After a patrol search the F-94 landed. My records show this sighting remains unidentified.

Statement of 1st Lt Henry E. Albert, Controller at Shirot.

The undesigned officer reported for work at Site #8, at 2345T, 5 Aug 52. Controller being relived informed me of an unusual sighting reported to him by Haneda tower operators. This was reported to me as being a lighted object hovering north-east of Haneda. After discussion with ADCC controller, it was decided that an F-94, should be scrambled to investigate.

At the time of scramble, I had what was believed to be the object in radar contact. The radar sighting indicated the object to be due south of this station over Tokyo Bay and approximately eight (8) miles northeast of Haneda. the target was in a right orbit moving at varying speeds. It was impossible to estimate speed due to the short distance and times involved.

At 0001 I was scrambled to invostiagate an unidentified object reported  by a contro1 tower operator at Haneda. The object was reported to be in the Tokyo bay area in an orbit to the starboard at an estimated altitude of 5,000 feet. I observed nothing of an unusual nature in this area, however at 0011H we vectored by Hi-linx on a heading of 320 degrees  and directed to look for a bogie at 11:00 o'clock --7 miles. Lt. Jones made radar contact at 10 degree port 6000 yards. The pielt turned rapidly from port to starboard and disappeared from the scope. I had no visual contact with the target. Soon after this contact the search was aband- oned. I continued to search the Tokyo bay area independantly until 0120L. The weather was 3 to 4 cloud covered at an estimated altitude of 14,000 feet, with excepitions visibility of 60-70 miles. The only known air trafic at this time was a C-54 in the pattern at Haneda and another C-54 over Johnson A.B., aproximately 30 minutes later.

STATEMENT
At 00001 it Holier and I  were scrambled to investigate an unidentified target toy, Tokyo by Upon becoming airbome we immediately took up a heading for Tokyo Bay At 00091, Hi-Inu reported a target at our 9 o'clock possttion. Visual contact made at 00010T with this target and identified as a C-54. We then started a starboard searching orbit under GCI control, southeast of Haneda A. Bb . At 00011r H- Arts gave us a vector of 320 degrees H- inax bad a definite radar echo and gave us a vector to intercept the unidentified target. Hi-Jinx estimated the target to be at 6 ' clook to us at a range of 2 miles. at 00181 1 picked up a radar contact at 10 degrees port, 10 degree below at 6,000 yards. The target was rapidly moving from port to starboard and a "lock on" could not be accomplished. A turn to the stardarboard was instigated to intercept target witch disappeared on scope in approx. ositively 90 seconds. No visual contact was made with the unidentified target. hi-inax was' then contacted and they were unable to give us another vector because they also had lost radar contact with the unidentified target. We continued our search over Tokyo bay under H-Jinx control. At 00331 H-Jinx released us from scrambled mission. The only other aircraft intercepted during this misison was at 0010T. This airoraft was identified as a C-54 on course  of 350 degrees altitude 5000 feet, speed 180 knots. We noticed nothing of unusual nature from this time until we' landed at 01201.

The first time I noticed the intense bright light over the Bay, was while crossing the ramp on our way to the tower. At first we thought it was an air-craft with landing lights on, but as we kept watching we noticed it wasn’t mov-ing. When we were about half way across the ramp it disappeared for the first time and returned to approximately the same spot about 15 seconds later.

After we got in the tower I started looking at it with binoculars, which made the object much clearer. Around the bright white light in the middle, there was a darker object which stood out against the sky, having little white lights along the outer edge, and a glare around the whole thing.

I watched it disappear twice through the glasses. It seemed to travel to the East and gaining altitude at a very fast speed, much faster than any jet. Every time it disappeared it returned again, except for the last time when the jets were around. It seemed to know they were there.

As for an estimate on the size of the object— I couldn’t even guess.

I know it wasn’t a star, weather balloons or Venus, because I compared it with all three.

When we first saw it, we estimated it to be at about 5,000 feet. We couldn’t estimate the distance because of the angle we were looking at it and the brightness.. It was to the NNE of the field.

I watched it from 11:30 to 12:30, it was very clear in the east until then. The bright light disappeared again at about 12:30 and we lost sight of it due to the broken clouds that moved in at that time. We kept looking for it whenever the clouds broke, but we never saw it again.

At __2320__ 5 August 1952, A/3C Llody West and A/3C Walter Outowskl, 1956-1 AACS Detachment, whle crossing the ramp on their way to work at the Haneda Air Force Base eontrol tower, (35°33'N-139°5S'E), sighted an exceptionally bright light in the sky to the NE of Haneda Air Force Base. Upon reporting for duty, they brought the object to the attention of N/2C Walter Jackson and A/3G George Latassy, who had not previously noticed it because the operating load had been keeping their attention elsewhere.

a. The four operators agreed on the appearance of the object and watched it through 7 X 50 binoculars for a total period of about 50 minutes to 1 hour. The light was described as circular in shape, with brilliance appearing to be constant across the face. The light appeared to be a portion of a large round dark shape which was about four times the diameter of the light. When the object was close enough for details to be seen, a small, less-brilliant light could be seen at the lower left edge, with ewe or three more dim lights running in a curved line along the rest of lower edge of the dark shape. Only the lower portion of the darker shape could be determined, due to the lighter sky which was believed to have blended with the upper side of the object. No rotation was noticed. No sound was heard.

b. The object faded twice to the East, then returned. Observers were unable to judge whether disappearance was due to a dimming of the lights, rotation of object, or to the object moving away at terrific speed, since at times of fading, the object was difficult to follow closely, except as a small light. Observers did agree that when close, the object did appear to move horizontally, varying apparent position and speed slightly.

c. Three of the operators indicated the size of the light, when closest to the tower, was approximately the same as the small ceiling balloons (30 grams, appearing 24 inches in diameter) when launched from the weather station, located at about 2000 feet from the tower. This would make the size of the central light about 50 feet in diameter, when at the 10 miles distance tracked by GCI. At the greatest distance, the size of the light appeared slightly larger than Venus, approximately due East of Haneda and slightly brighter. A lighted weather balloon was launched at 2400 hours. The balloon's light was described as extremely dim and yellow when compared to the brilliant blue-white light of the object. Observers stated that their eyes would fatigue rapidly when they attempted to concentrate their vision on the object.

d. Shiroi GCI was contacted, (35°49'N-140°02'E), and after visual vectors were given, were able to track the object. An F-94 was in turn scrambled for an attempted intercept.

e. The control tower at [Tachikawa Air Force Base] called Haneda tower at approximately 2350/I to bring their attention to a brilliant white light over Tokyo Bay. The tower replied that it had been in view for some time and that it was being checked.

f. A C-54 entering Haneda traffic was requested to check the object. The pilot replied that it looked like a brilliant star and dismissed the sighting as such.

g. The F-94 appeared over Haneda just before the C-54 landed. After the C-54 turned North, the tower called Shiroi to direct the F-94 to turn right. No visual contact was made by the F-94.

h. The F-94 was vectored to the radar contact maintained by the Shiroi GCI. A radar contact was made by the F-94, but was lost after 90 seconds. Soon after loss of radar contact by Shiroi and the F-94, the tower lost visual contact as the object either faded, moved away, or was obstructed by clouds.

**IR-35-52** \

**PAGE:** 2 **OF** 4 **PAGES** \

**1.** a. Site #4, 528th Aircraft Control and Warning Group, located at Shiroi Air Force Base, was notified of the location of the unidentified object soon after the first visual contact by the tower. The CPS-1 radar is normally operated at maximum range, and contact was attempted on both high and low beams by Lt. Rawlins, the controller on duty. Three or four blips were noted at a position 050° bearing from Haneda, as reported by the tower, but no definite movement could be ascertained, and no Height/Range contact could be made with the CPS-4 due to ground clutter. \
b. Lt. Albert reported for duty at 2345/I, and was soon able to make radar contact on the 5-1G high beam. An F-94 was scrambled to investigate. The object at that time had left the ground clutter and could be tracked at varying speeds in a right orbit. Though impossible to accurately estimate speed, Lt. Albert gave a rough estimate of from 100-150 knots, stopping and hovering occasionally, and a maximum speed during the second orbit (just before F-94 was vectored in) of possibly 250-300 knots. At approximately 0021/I the object reportedly broke into three smaller contacts maintaining an interval of about 1/4 mile, with one contact remaining somewhat tighter. The F-94 was vectored on this object, reporting weak contact at 0015/I and loss of contact at 0018/I. Within a few seconds, both the F-94 and the object entered the ground clutter and were not seen again. \
c. The blips on the CPS-1 were described as small and relatively weak, but sharply defined. The brightness varied somewhat, and at one time appeared very bright as the object appeared to be in a fairly sharp turn at higher speed than previously noted. Both recorded orbits were in approximately the same position with the object moving and occasionally hovering in one position for several minutes. PH, NYF surveillance of area was made for an extended period of time and no further contact was made. \
2. The ADC Controller at Johnson Air Force Base was kept informed of the incident as it took place. Personnel at Site #4 attempted unsuccessfully to make visual contact with the object, which at times was less than ten miles distance from Shiroi Air Force Base. Radar was functioning normally before and after the incident. \
3. The F-84 with Lt. Wesley R. Rider as pilot and lst Lt. Aaron Jones, radar operator, was scrambled at approximately 2555/I. There was a slight delay in becoming airborne due to fuel system trouble during run-up. Aircraft became airborne at 0005/I and was directed to make a search from Haneda Air Force Base northeast over Tokyo Bay. No visual contact was made at any time. \
a. The F-94 crew reported exceptional visibility in the air, with a very thin cloud layer at 11,000 to 16,000 feet and one or two isolated patches of thin clouds lower. The CPS-1 in the tower at Haneda Air Force Base was very clearly seen. The only stars seen at a low elevation were the North Star and Venus. As the F-94 headed North, the Control Tower asked GCI to vector the F-94 toward the east. Looking off their right forward quarter and turning in the direction requested, the F-94 was still unable to see anything unusual. \
b. As the F-94 orbited to the right at approximately 330 knots T.A.S., the GCI radar re-established contact with the object and vectored the F-94 on a course of 040°. GCI called the object at 11 o'clock to the F-94, 5 miles. At this time the F-94 managed to make a weak contact at 007 port, 10° low, at a range of 6,000 yards, \
approximately 300 KT. \
c. The radar contact at approximately 35°T*N-139°5E', was described as weak and small but distinct and definable from the ground clutter encountered. The radar operator, Lt. Jones, was very busy, maintaining the weak contact by manual control. As the object moved across the scope from the port to starboard, it appeared to increase speed and Lt. Jones called for a hard right turn. As the aircraft turned, the object appeared to suddenly accelerate and disappear rapidly from the scope on a course of 046°. \

approximately 059°. Contact was maintained for approximately 90 seconds. No further returns were found. In a search pattern, the pilot checked the area very thoroughly for any visual signs without success.

d. The APO-35 radar Is checked before and after every mission and appeared to be working normally. The blip was described as definitely an airborne target and behaved as a bona-fide target, except when it appeared to accelerate off the right edge of the scope. The overcast was extremely thin, and all objects in the area could be seen clearly. The F-94 crew stated that there was no possibility of any radar contact from any of the clouds in the area at that time.

e. Haneda weather at time of sighting was recorded as 2500 scattered, 16000 broken, 15 miles visibility, with wind SSE at 11 mph. Weather reported by the personnel involved with the incident was thin scattered to broken at 114,000-16,000 feet, generally thin enough to allow almost full brilliance of the moon to shine through. One or two thin scattered puff's were reported by the P-9u crew with none reported by Haneda tower. The weather moving in from the southwest was lower broken clouds sufficient to obscure the moon as the clouds moved over Tokyo Bay about 0045/I to 0100/I. Visibility was reported as exceptional with Mount Fuji (60 nautical miles to the west) clearly discernable. Scattered thunderstorms activity was reported in the mountains to the Northwest of the Tokyo area. Temperature recorded at Haneda was 78°, Dew Point 73;. with altimeter setting of 29.861 inches.

5._ the personnel involved were all serious, intelligent, and completely cooper- tive.

& Tower personnel cross-checked an known factors constantly and did not attempt to make any inferences in the sigh!ing. Object is believed to have been re- ported exactly as they saw it.

Ift. Albert] GCI Controller st: the Shiroi site, has had considerable ex- perience under all conditions and thoroughly understands the capabilities of the CZPS-1 radar. His statement was that the object was a bona-fide moving target, though some- what weaker than that normally obtained from a single let fighter.

c itk Jones, P-Q4’; radar operator, has had about seven years experience with airborné radar equipment. He states that the object was a bona-fide target, and that to his knowledge, there was nothing within a area of 15-20 miles tha could give a radar echo.

COMMENTS BY PREPARING OFFICER:

1. The ten minute difference in time between the statement by Lf. Albert, 528th AC 8 W Sq, and that reported by other personnel concerned, is believed to be a typo- graphical error, since the statement agrees on every other portion of the sighting.

2. The map grid coordinates listed on 35th Fighter Interceptor Wing Form 112, IR-1-52, are in error, since the area of contact was as shown in Inclosure #5. Error may have been due to a mis-reading by the original debriefing officer.

3. This is the first sighting in the Far East which combined positive visual and radar contact over an extended period of time. The following items may have some bearing on this sighting:

a: At the night of the incident, there was a full moon. The F-9&U crew reported exceptional visibility and stated that the upper cloud layer did not appreciably affect the briliiancy of the moonlight. Reflections off the water were considered, as

sufficient to form secondary reflections off the lower clouds. Isolated patches
of thin clouds were reported by the F-94 crew as being at approximately 4000 feet,
wtth fairly strong reflections making them visible. These clouds were not reported to be
visible by the control tower personnel. Al 3/c LaNasse reported that as he returned to
the barracks, he noticed that the object seemed somewhat' higher in the sky than pre­ violllly, arul that lie noticed at the same time that the moon seemed proportionately
higher in elevation.

B. There was some thunderstorm activity in the mountains to the northwest,
of Tokyo. Although lower broken clouds later moved over Tokyo Bay, there was no re­
ported electrical activity or vertical development in these clouds. Visibility was
approximately· the same as earlier.

C. The only objects reported in th• area at the time of sighting were the
C-54 landing at Haneda and the weather balloon launched by the Haneda weather station
at 2100/I. Both were continually in sight of control tower personnel. Venus was
located low on the horizon and was definitely identified by the Tower, the GCI Site,
and the F-94 crew.

D. According to the radar tracking, the object should have passed very close
to Site #4 at Shiroi. A constant search of the area by personnel at the site, and the
thorough search by the F-94 without visual contact indicates possible moonlight re­
flections, since the object was visible to the tower personnel" at· both Haneda and
Tachikawa, located 30.miles to the west. The azimuth of the moon at this·time was
l.5g0 , with an 'elevation of approximately 36°. A secondary reflection off a cloud could
conceivably be'bright to observers to the south or west, while the remainder of the
cloud could block!: the reflection from above and to the north.

E. ,'!.'he F.,..,94 ci;ew evidently made an -extremely thorough search over the area,
and appeared'. to · be perplexed that they had been unable to make visual contact, since
everything witliin 20 to 25 miles was easily visible. flying at 5,000 feet, they could
spot the iscilatiec! lower'. cloud patches. Failure to sight the object could only be due
to the light on the lower surface of the object, or reflected In a narrot beam
toward the . south· and w&t..

F. t'he Iitrange appearance could be attributed to a localized blinding effect
fi: using lhe lll·uolon of a darker form, particularly with the lower scattered lights to
give an il luato of an outline,

G. ~t'ht'lile many sigh tings might be attributed to visual and electrical re­
~flecilons off. Itinized areas in the atmosphere, the near-perfect visibility on the night
of the slgntlng together with the circular orbit of the object would tend to disprove
this theory.

```
5 August 1952, Haneda AFB, Japan

Report of radar targets does not allow a plausible explanation of
the nature of the targets. Absence of weather data, i.e. temperature 
vs height and moisture vs height does not allow an anomalous propaga-
tion estimate. However, the report states that targets did appear to 
be permanent echoes at various times.
