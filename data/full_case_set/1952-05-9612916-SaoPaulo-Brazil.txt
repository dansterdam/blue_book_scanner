Memorandum for Record

SUBJECT: Trip to George AFB on 20-23 May 1952.

On 17 May 1952, Lt E. J. Ruppelt called Major Vincent Wolrath, Wing Intelligence Officer of the 94C[Fighter Bomber Wing at George AFB, Calif. Major Wolrath stated that due to the recent flurry of sightings he deemed it very advisable to send someone from ATIC to George AFB. Lt Ruppelt had orders cut and departed by commercial air on 20 May 1952 arriving at George AFB late on the evening of the 20th.

On 21 May 1952, Lt Ruppelt contacted Major Wolrath who reviewed sightings on(Q-9-11-13-14, and 20 Mays. Several of these sightings from a T-6, seemed to be repetitive and plans were made to attempt to observe the object on the afternoon of 21 May.

Lt Melzer, who had piloted the T-6, during previous observations was contacted. He offered to fly that P.M. and take Lt Ruppelt along as observer and assistant in setting up an observation team. Both the Ground Control Intercept (Radar) and Fighter Interceptor squadron or ADC were contacted and briefed on the sightings and plans to observe from a T-6. They agreed to stand by all afternoon on "D" channel of VHF in case the object was sighted. If it was, F-86's would be scrambled and radar would attempt a pick-up. A ground station and a ground observer team headed by Major Wolrath was equipped with a ground VHF set and would have a telescope to make ground observations from the George AFB line. Weather was alerted in case a theodolite was needed. All VHF sets were set up for "D" channel on a special frequency to keep the interception of messages to a minimum.

At 1330 PIST, the T-6 was airborne. Lt Ruppelt had a Leica with a 135 mm telephoto lens in case photos could be taken. At 1420 PIST, the ground observation team called the T-6 and stated they were observing the object through a telescope and it appeared to be a balloon. Also it was identical to several of the previous reports as previous observers were on the ground watching. The aerial search was commenced with no success and at 1440 PDST the object disappeared. The aerial search was broken off and the T-6 landed.

Lt Ruppelt contacted Edwards AFB and was informed that at 1433 PDST a Rawin-sounde balloon from their station burst at 75,000'-80,000' SSE of their station (approximately over George AFB).

It was concluded that the object was this balloon.

On 22 May 1952, the entire day was spent interviewing sources of other sightings. It will be noted that although some of the reports were attributed to balloons, others could not be and are still being investigated.

Lt Ruppelt returned to W-P AFB on 23 May.

The cooperation received at George AFB was excellent.

APPENDIX VI

George AFB, Calif. - 1, 9, 13, 14, 20 May 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

The sighting on 1 May 1952 at George AFB, Calif., was the first of a series of nine sightings there in a three week period. These sightings were all by military personnel.

a. 1 May 1952 - Five round, disc-shaped objects, flat white in color which gave no glare or reflection were sighted. They were in formation with three in front and two in the rear. The latter two darted around in a circular or zig-zag manner.

b. 9 May 1952, 1030 PDST - An unidentified round, silver object was sighted visually from the ground and from two F-86 aircraft.

c. 9 May 1952, 1230 PDST - Two unidentified objects moving with the current or breeze at a slow speed. They appeared to be a silver metal color with a dark spot in the center and at certain angles to the sun gave off a bright glare.

d. 9 May 1952, 1720 PDST - Object was of dull color like a thundercloud. It was shaped like an arrowhead but had no known aerodynamic features.

e. 11 May 1952, 1220 PDST - Object looked like a white paper plate flipping end over end with an initial speed comparable to a jet although later it reduced its pace.

f. 13 May 1952, 1425 PDST - Single object, appeared round, shiny, metallic which glowed or reflected white or silver was observed for thirty minutes.

g. 14 May 1952, 1405 to 1430 PDST - Same description as object sighted on 13 May and by same sources.

h. 20 May 1952, 1425 PDST - A silver colored, bright, round object was observed for five minutes. Initially the object was stationary but eventually moved and faded away.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

Only balloons released from Edwards AFB can be tracked accurately over George AFB, consequently, for the most part they are the only balloons with which we are concerned. These balloons are released irregularly thus accounting for some of the unusual times of sightings reported in cases which are probably balloons.

```
The project monitor of Blue Book went to George AFB to investigate the various reports.

a. 1 May 1952 - Report well documented. No additional information obtained.

b. 9 May 1952, 1030 PDST - A balloon was released from Edwards AFB, 55 minutes prior to this sighting.

c. 9 May 1952, 1230 PDST - No known activity which could account for sighting.

d. 9 May 1952, 1720 PDST - No known activity which could account for sighting.

e. 11 May 1952 - Third report in three days from same individual. No activity in area.

f. 13 May 1952 - Balloon launched from Edwards AFB at 1340 PDST.

g. 14 May 1952 - No balloon release officially reported.

h. 20 May 1952 - Balloon released from Edwards AFB at 1332 PDST.

III. CONCLUSIONS

a. 1 May 1952 - No Conclusions.

b. 9 May 1952, 1030 PDST - Very probable that the balloon released from Edwards AFB was the object sighted.

c. 9 May 1952, 1230 PDST - Very possible that paper was caught in the thermals and swept along. A similar sighting turned out to be just that.

d. 9 May 1952, 1720 PDST - No conclusions.

e. 11 May 1952 - No conclusions.

f. 13 May 1952 - Probably was balloon released from Edwards AFB, 45 minutes previous.

g. 14 May 1952 - Description fits incident of 13 May so perfectly it is highly probable that the object was a balloon.

h. 20 May 1952 - Balloon released 53 minutes prior to sighting was probably object observed.
