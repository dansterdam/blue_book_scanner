The image contains a sketch or diagram related to a UFO sighting or report. The diagram shows a curved trajectory path with some annotations and a compass rose or directional marker. There does not appear to be any photographic image in this particular page.

Transcription of the text in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curve where the object was above the horizon at (azimuth) when you first saw it. Place an "0" on the curve where the object was above the horizon at (azimuth) when you last saw it. Draw a line connecting the "X" and "0" that will show the path that the object or objects made. Place an arrow at the beginning of the path, a "+" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Indicate that in the sketch by placing them in their relative positions to show the direction they were moving.

Transcribing the text from the image:

To whom it may concern:
The saucer at which my eyes first could distinguish was about 50 to 60 ft in diameter and had a color of a dull or grey. This flying object appeared on a clear night, just after sundown, about 6.30 p. m. It came into view about 10Â° above the horizon, traveling at a phenomenal speed of at least 800 miles per hour and did not make any sound. This object had a strange luminescent glow and was not transparent but translated a brilliant light. As this object came into view it suddenly stopped, then executed a downward curve toward the ground, approximately 75 yards distant. Then it turned and slowly climbed up to a considerable height where it just disappeared from view. This all happened in a matter of a few minutes and was witnessed by two other reliable persons who gave the same account as mine.

To produce the text from the document, as requested:

To compare the object seen on this date with the sightings near Ipswich, Mass. on 1-5-65, a detailed sketch of the object was prepared. The description of the object was approximately 40 feet long, cigar shaped with a pronounced fin on the rear. The speed of the object was estimated to be in excess of 600 mph. The object was seen at approximately 1:00 AM.
