10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Object observed visually and on radar. It was probably closer than first thought, this would tend to indicate that obj was almost overhead. At this time witness felt obj was too bright to be a star (apparent). There was no trail or exhaust and the obj appeared to be just hovering, then accelerated and passed out of sight. The available evidence indicates that obj viewed by witnesses was probably bright star.

Analysis and Conclusions: THE OBJECT VIEWED BY THESE WITNESSES WAS PROBABLY OF METEOROLOGICAL ORIGIN, I.C. THE WITNESSES REPORTED SIGHTING A BRIGHT OBJECT WHICH MOVED DIRECTLY UPWARDS TO AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 270Â°. THE WITNESSES PLACED THE OBJECT DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. THIS WOULD TEND TO INDICATE THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOST LIKELY A METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA SUCH AS A VERY BRIGHT METEOR OR BOLIDE, AS NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WAS FOUND TO INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF ANY TANGIBLE OBJECT. THE WITNESSES' FACES EAST AND THE CATHEDRAL WINDOW IS ON THE WEST SIDE, INDICATING THAT THE OBJECT IS WEST. THE SITE

THE SAME, THE WITNE8S REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT WAS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, APPROXIMATELY 50-60 FEET IN DIAMETER, AND SILVER IN COLOR. THE OBJECT HOVERED AND MANEWERED OVER THE AREA FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES. IT THEN PROCEEDED TO-CLIMB ALMOST VERTICALLY AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT.

AND OUR   TO THIS BEING JUST BEFORE PASSED BELOW THE HORIZON, THE OBJEOT MOVED JE FRONT OF THE WITNESSES AT A RAPID  RATE  OF SPEED, AND WEIS SOME DISTANCE AWAY WHEN IT DISAPPEARED.

ALL WITNESSES OBSERVED THE OBJECT AND THEIR STATEMENTS ARE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT AS TO ITS APPEARANCE, BEHAVIOR AND DISAPPEARANCE.

THIS IS A RATHER UNUSUAL SIGHTING, AND THE FILE IS THEREFORE BEING FORWARDED TO THE SPECIAL PROJECT BLUE BOOK SECTION FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS.

ASTRONOMY

Impressive Stellar Display

Brilliant winter constellations shining on December evenings include Orion, Canis Major, Jupiter and Saturn are visible early, James Stokley reports.

WITH THE ARRIVAL of December the brilliant constellations of the winter sky are now rising in the east in the early evening, and becoming visible to the neighbors, which occupy a region of the sky that once hours bright than any other part of the firma ment, as shown on the accompanying map.

The three bright stars known as Orion's Belt are the most prominent feature of the winter sky, and appear at the first of December, an hour after the middle of the night, and continue to be prominent throughout the winter months.

A good place to start is with the three stars of Orion's Belt, exactly vertical, placed in the sky so that the line formed by them points up ward to Aldebaran, the red star in Taurus, and downward to Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, situated in the constellation Canis Major, the great dog.

Directly below Orion is Sirius, it is the brightest star we can see in the nighttime sky. Even though it is higher on the horizon, it does not appear as bright as Sirius because of the general absorption in the atmosphere. Sirius still shines with great splendor.

Canis Minor Sends in the East

Over toward the east, a little higher than Sirius, is found the small constellation Canis Minor, with its bright star Procyon. And above this group is the constellation Gemini, the Twins, which are two fairly bright stars, about equally well-known stars per on the map of the northern sky.

Above Orion is Taurus, the Bull, and just to the left of the point of the Bull's horn is the Pleiades, or the Seven Sisters, of which six are visible to the naked eye of most people. To the left of Taurus (also to the southeast, a little) is Auriga, the Charioteer, with its brilliant star Capella.

In the northwest is Vega, about all that is now visible of the constellation of Lyra, the Lyre, which is much lower in the sky and less prominent now--the brightest--but in low altitude rises scarcely to a sufficient height in the evening to be seen with good effect. Similarly above is Altair, the brightest star of the Eagle, which is part of Aquila, the Eagle, but lower in altitude and less prominent now.

Jupiter and Saturn are visible early in the evening, the former being the bright "star" in the southeast, while Saturn may be seen farther west, and is a little dimmer. Both are in the southern part of the sky, and can be observed through much of the early part of the evening.

Southern Hemisphere is at the beginning of summer, while the northern hemisphere is at the beginning of winter. The sun is seen far to the south of the Eastern point of the horizon. It is then south about 30 degrees west. Consequently it has a long curve bow, which means that the hours of daylight are long, and the sun stays high in the sky.

The reason the northern sun is low in the sky is that the sun's path in the northern sky, at this season of the year, is as far south as it ever gets. So that when the sun is on the meridian, or due south, it would be, to an observer on the central meridian of your time zone, (That is, at 5 p. m. local time, which is 90 degrees for Central, 105 degrees for Mountain, and 120 degrees for Pacific.) To the east and west, the sun would be later, to the east earlier. On Dec. 21, the sun sets at 4:55 p.m. and rises at 7:32 a.m.

The latest rising, at 7:22 a.m., comes from PCS 10 on the 11th. This means from 0 to 55 minutes, while the earliest sunsets come several days before the 21st. While these sunrises come a day or two later.

The reason lies in the fact that the sun's path around the celestial poles is not a perfect circle. It is a little elliptical, which causes the variation in the time of the earliest sunrises and the latest sunsets. Noon came when the sun was highest in the sky, aiming due north, with the length of the day the shortest.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with detailed celestial time information and observations related to the movement of the sun, moon, and planets.

Satellites runs fast, sometimes slow, but cause of the way the earth revolves around gives their motion irregular. As clocks come into use, "mean" time was introduced, which is based on the average speed of the earth's rotation.

At the beginning of November, mean time is about 15 minutes slow in relation to apparent time. After that - during December - the clock gains rapidly on the sundial. In mid-December the sun will be almost 15 minutes late.

The difference between mean and apparent time is called the "equation of time," it is the number of minutes and seconds that you must add to or subtract from the mean time indicated by the clock to get the correct apparent or sundial time.

On Dec. 6, approximately midway in the rapid gain of the equation of time, is 6 minutes 11 seconds. On Dec. 21, approximately midway to the least equation of time, is 3 minutes 17 seconds.

Sunset
Dec. 6 4:44 p.m.  
Jan. 6 4:49 p.m.

Sunrise 
Dec. 6 7:16 a.m.
Jan. 6 7:20 a.m.

Now the latest sunrise and the earliest sunset do not occur on the shortest day - but with the least time between the rising and setting.

In other words, the sun performs according to its own kind of time, not the artificial kind of time that man has found most convenient to regulate his activities.

December 27, Springfiel, 0-45 a.m. Caro 6)uunley and here nbunched were sighted after the UFO appeared. Their object appeared ovoid in shape and gave off a pulsating light. They observed it through a 15-power telescope. Although the object was quite distant, it appeared quite large. As they watched it, the object suddenly split into three parts, and then went through the telescope, one side was dark and the other side was light. The object then disappeared, leaving a reddish glow behind.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
SOURCE: SAUCER NEWS, Mar 62
3 Dec 61
Sacramento, Calif.
Here's an unusual item from Sacramento, California, dated December 8, 1961: A weather-Air Force radar station a few miles outside Fairfield, California, had reportedly tracked a very large object moving rapidly across the Sacramento Valley from the southwest to the northeast. The object was tracked for a brief period by a sophisticated military radar system, but as it approached, the radar apparantly "lost" the object. The object was never seen visually, and apparently left no physical traces, but the radar operators were completely convinced of its reality. These reports led to the jet chase.

THE A. P. R. O. BULLETIN
MARCH, 1963
Missile, Contrail or UFO?
From Weatherville, and Eureka, Call- fornia, from Burns, Oregon and Reno, Nevada came reports on 6 December 1961, of the observation of a weserly moving object. The object was officially ex plained as (1) a Thor missile launched from Vandenburg and (2) a vapor trail from a high altitude, high performance craft known to be flying in the area.
Take your pick.
