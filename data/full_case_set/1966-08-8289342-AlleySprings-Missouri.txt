The text in the document is as follows:

RECORD OF VISIT [ ] CONFERENCE OR [ ] TELEPHONE CALL

SUBJECT: Balloon

MR. Little called concerning the balloon, and we discussed brifly. He stated that the balloon intended to have the contractor at the Center pick it up at Ft. Worth and Houston to supply a new one. He indicated that their contract with the Balloon instructs him to do this. The Center work order will recommend to the contractor to supply a new balloon due to the following conditions:

1. If the balloon descends at any time below 15,000 feet.
2. The instant it reaches the coastline.
3. When they lose contact or are unable to determine where the balloon is located.

He Little stated that FAA will assist in locating and painting of the balloon and that the Watch Supervisor should check the location of the balloon, including height. The Watch Supervisor should advise him (Little) of this information.

Mr. Little stated the FAA will maintain a watch for the location and painting of the balloon and that the supervisors are standing by concerning instructions relative to the disposition of the balloon. Any significant information should be forwarded to Mr. Wrate: Little for the Area office.

INCOMING MESSAGE

AF IN: 10707 (8 Sept 66)	Pg 5 of 6

THAT THE BALLOON HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE AREA APPROXIMATELY 10 DAYS, 
THAT THE ALTITUDE VARIES BETWEEN 40 AND 69 THOUSAND FT. THAT THE
DIAMETER IS APPROXIMATELY 500 FT AND THE KBOKA RADIO STATION IN
KENNETT, MO, HAD REPORTED A WEATHER BALLOON IN THE AREA.
PARA TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE DIVISION, 9TH BAMLEMENT WING
BLYTHEVILLE AFB, ARKANSAS.
PAGE 5 RUKGHU 1317 UNCLAS

THE MOST LOGICAL EXPLANATION OF THE CAUSE OF THIS SIGHTING IS THAT 
THE OBSERVER SAW THE LARGE WEATHER BALLOON WHICH REPORTEDLY HAS BEEN
DRIFTING IN THE AREA FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 DAYS. SEVERAL OFFICERS
HAVE REPORTED SEEING THE BALLOON, THE 8-52 WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDER
OBSERVATION FOR THE LENGTH OF TIME REPORTED BY THE OBSERVER AND
UNQUESTIONABLY WAS TOO FAR AWAY AND TOO HIGH TO BE OBSERVED. PARTICULARLY
IN VIEW OF THE LATE AFTERNOON TIME OF OBSERVATION. IT WILL BE NOTED
THAT THE OBSERVER REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED AT
APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES BEFORE SUNSET AND WAS IN VIEW FOR 
APPROXIMATELY ONE AND ONE-HALF HOURS BUT DISAPPEARED WHEN THE SUN
WENT DOWN. THIS APPARENT DISCREPANCY MIGHT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE
FACT THAT EMINENCE, MO, IS ON DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME OR BY POSSIBLE
ERRORS IN THE OBSERVER'S ESTIMATE OF THE TIME OF DAY, BUT THE 
OBSERVATION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF A WEATHER BALLOON.
