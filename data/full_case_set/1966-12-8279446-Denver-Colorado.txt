PROJECT 10673 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 7 Dec 66
2. LOCATION: Denver, Colorado
3. SOURCE: (civilian)
10. CONCLUSION: The object was observed by three witnesses. At the same degrees and at the same azimuth.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Witnesses watched a clear like object larger than perform erratic movements in the eastern part of the sky. The object sides shimmering and appeared to be a solid object. The entire sighting lasted about five to 10 seconds. The object could have been a satellite which did not appear to be a satellite.
The description is consistent with that of an astroobject which would have been fairly low on the horizon and would have been the brightest object in the sky.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains a scanned document that appears to be a response letter from Project Blue Book regarding an observation of an alleged flying object over the Denver area. The text of the document is as follows:

Proposed reply to letter from 30 December 1966

Dear _____,

Reference your letter of 30 December 1966 regarding your observation of an alleged flying object over the Denver area. A study of the information which you submitted for your 7 December 1966 observation was undertaken and revealed that you probably observed the star, Sirius. The description, size, brightness, movements, etc. are very consistent with the observation of that particular star. Sirius, with a stellar magnitude of approximately -1.5, is the brightest star visible in the heavens. 

When stars are viewed low on the horizon, the observer is looking through many more miles of the earth's atmosphere than when looking at stars overhead. The earth's atmosphere actually acts as a prism, causing the incoming light to be broken down into the various colors of the spectrum. In technical terms, this phenomena is called scintillation. The closer the stars are to the horizon, the more pronounced this scintillation will be, because we are looking through a thicker layer of atmosphere. This is why stars appear to be twinkling or scintillating most when low on the horizon. The most beautiful scintillation of all is that of the bright star, Sirius, which is visible in the winter months rather low in the sky.

From the information submitted, it does appear that Sirius was observed. The Air Force has received several reports during the months of November and December describing similar observations such as yours.

I hope this is helpful.

The image contains a hand-drawn diagram with annotations. The diagram appears to depict the movement and trajectory of an unidentified object, possibly a UFO. It includes annotations such as "27 inches - object", "object - star", "object travel as much as 6 inches in cone", and arrows showing the path of the object.

At the arrival of the object, it moved slowly and silently toward the observer, and a part of the moon was not seen.

The handwritten text in the document has been transcribed as follows:

At its arrival the object moved slowly and silently toward the observer 27' Inches - OBJECT

215' - 6' OBJECT - STAR

Object travel as much as 6 inches in cone

dark part of moon not seen

Text from the document:

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

Reference your letter regarding your December 7 observation allegedly of a bright object in the Denver, Colorado area. A light or lights were observed in the sky. The description, size, brightness, movements, and other characteristics are similar to many other reports of that type which are frequently received. This type of phenomenon is visible in the heavens.

When stars are viewed low on the horizon the observer is looking through many more miles of the earth's atmosphere than when looked at overhead. This distortion by the atmosphere can cause various colors or the illusion of pulsation. This phenomenon is called "scintillation". The closer the object, the more they scintillate because we are looking through more atmosphere. Planets twinkle far less than stars.

From the information submitted, it does appear that the sighting you observed was an astronomical phenomenon and not an unidentified flying object. The Air Force received several reports during November and early December of this type of sighting, as expected.

Thank you for reporting your sighting to the Air Force.

Sincerely,
GEORGE G. FREEMAN, JR.
