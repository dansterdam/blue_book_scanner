The text in the document reads as follows:

Commander Foreign Technology Division, 
Wright Patterson Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio

Attn: Aerial Phenomena Group

Dear Sir:

At 5:00 PM CST on December 29, 1961, Mr. and myself were travelling south on US 31W about 10 miles north of Goodlettsville, Tennessee, when we saw what appeared to be strange objects in the sky for several minutes. After observing these objects in the sky for a few minutes, I stopped at a roadside phone booth to WPAFB and was connected with a duty officer who made a report of my experience. During this conversation I was told an investigation would be made and if the experience could not be explained, more information might be required from me. As I have not been contacted, I assume the investigation resulted in a satisfactory explanation.

The February 19 issue of Newsweek has a small article describing the results of investigations performed last year and states that a very few reports were unexplained.  

I would like to know whether an investigation was conducted on my report, and if so what were the results.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

OFFICIAL FILE COPY

TD-2/Major Friend/W/69216

UFO Sighting, Goodlettsville, Tennessee
15 MAR 1962

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

The UFO sighted by you and Mr. [REDACTED] on 29 December 1961, near Goodlettsville, Tennessee, was determined to be non-persistent contrails illuminated by moonlight.

The objects appeared to be only five times their usual size because the condensation trails were non-persistent and were dispersing soon after they were formed.

There are two types of condensation trails, aerodynamic and engine exhaust trails. Since the engine exhaust type is usually of short duration, the engine exhaust trails were the ones observed in this case.

Though the sun had set at the time of your sighting, the condensation trails, due to their altitudes, were still in sunlight. The color of the contrails is attributed to dispersion.

We thank you for your interest in reporting an incident which might have been thought to be the sighting of the United States.

Sincerely,

[REDACTED]
DONALD E. KEYHOE
Colonel, USAF (Ret.)
Chief, Evaluations and Components

The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" point and a "B" point, which are meant to indicate how high an object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it, and how high it was when the observer lost sight of it. The second sketch shows a larger drawing with an "A" point and a person standing on a road.

Here is the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
