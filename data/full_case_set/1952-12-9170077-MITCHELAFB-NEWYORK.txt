SUBJECT: Letter of Commendation

TO: Commanding Officer
Mitchell Air Force Base
New York

The Air Technical Intelligence Center wishes to commend two officers over one organization, Ledge Grogan and Carubia Lytzen, both of Base Operations, for the excellent and thorough manner in which they investigated a report of an unidentified flying object which originated with your organization on 1 November 1952. This investigation disclosed new and additional information heretofore not known to this Headquarters, and made available significant data.

Airway, Newark Airport, and Investigator Airport, having obtained this information, have given active cooperation and have furnished additional charts in order to assist in arriving at a solution to the cause of this incident. Their thoroughness and their willingness to cooperate in this investigation, and their imaginative approach to a logical conclusion are highly commendable.

Mitchel Air Force Base, New York
1 December 1952

I. Description of Incident
Between 0430 and 0500 EST a number of observers from varying locations around the New York City area observed a strange, round object with colors ranging between white, white-orange and amber. All observations placed the unknown in the New York City area showing the highest elevation angle of about 35°. The object was observed with the naked eye and with binoculars. Although radar was tried, there was no electronic sighting.

Observers were experienced CAA rated Airways Operations Specialists and Control Tower Operators. Observations of the object were as follows:

Location      Azimuth    Elevation   Time
a. Teterboro Tower        275°           0°         0447
b. Westchester Tower      220°          15°        0455
c. Newark Tower           315°           0°         0454
d. La Guardia Tower       320°           4°         0450
e. Idlewild Tower         275°          15°        0455
f. Mitchell AFB Tower     305°           6°         0500

An Eastern Airlines Flight inbound to La Guardia was queried as to a strange light appearing in the west. The pilot notified the object and departed the area. The weather at the time of observation was CAVU and extremely clear for the New York City vicinity with the winds NNW at 16 knots average.

II. Discussion of Incident
Intelligence personnel at Mitchel AFB determined that the planet Jupiter, on 1 December, had an approximate azimuth of 305°, a 2° magnitude (extremely bright), and disappeared below the horizon as the object was last observed. Undoubtedly, the unknown object is thus explained. The outline of other color-range under the expended presence of light reflecting through atmospheric dust. This report is one of the most complete in the files and is comparatively uncommon. Positive identification has been made with astronomical observations and no further investigations are contemplated. If the object had not been identified, more detailed data would have been possible.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typewritten document discussing a travel report regarding a sighting of an unidentified object described as the "Plant Jupiter" on December 1, 1952 at Mitchell AFB in New York. The document describes the investigation of the incident, noting that the weather conditions and descriptions were similar to a previous sighting on October 10th, and that the conclusion was that Lt. Flues did not pursue the matter further.

Here is the text content of the document:

Travel Report - Lt A. C. Flues
Mitchell AFB - 12 Dec 52

Lt Flues contacted Maj Geyer in Base Operations at Mitchell AFB. Major Geyer referred Lt Flues to Capt Dyste also of Base Operations who handled the investigation of the flyobprpt of 1 Dec 52. Capt Dyste had completed and forwarded through channels an AF Form 112, concerning this incident. Through the use of a statement of each observer and a navigator's star chart, Capt Dyste had positively identified the object as the planet Jupiter. Weather conditions and descriptions were strikingly similar to those of the Presque Isle sighting of 10 Oct. The followup 112 which should reach ATIC shortly was so complete in its details and the conclusion was so obvious and logical that Lt Flues did not pursue the matter further.

DATE: 12 December 1952
SIGHTING 18: Occurred at approximately 9:00 PM  
GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES: 40°44' N, 73°06' W
SUMMARY: The single object was sighted at several wide spread locations by 1st Lt. Ruppelt, USAF, and identified as the planet Jupiter. The object was observed maneuvering above the ground and a hovering motion was observed which was described as the object at 8000' altitude and drifting north and down. The color descrip tion was white or yellowish-white. The object was observed for approximately 10-15 minutes. No noise or trail was observed. The report indicates that many observations that would fit the description of the Jupiter. "Jupiter's motion, size, brightness and color description are similar to the observations described herein."
SIGNIFICANCE: The extreme motion, maneuver and description of the object as described would fit the majority of the observations made possible by exceptionally clear weather. Could have been responsible for the reported objects.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. Description: The single object was described as round, oval and elliptical. It appeared to be between 30 to 50 feet in diameter and was brilliant white in color. All observers agreed that the object seemed to have a definite metallic appearance. As it passed near the observers, it changed colors from a brilliant white to yellowish-orange. All observers were convinced that the object was not an aircraft or any known type of celestial body. The object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and followed a straight-line course, making a slight turn near the end of the horizon. All observers agreed that the object was under intelligent control.

2. Time sighted: The sightings all occurred from 0430 to 0500 EST.

3. Number of observations: All observers were members of or with personnel
attempts to observe the object by radar had negative results.

5. Information of observers: All the observers are CAA rated Airways Operations

STATEMENT

Dec. 2, 1952

At approximately 04435 on December 1, 1952, LaGuardia Tower requested that the unidentified controller on duty at the Teterboro Tower scan the horizon west of the field for some object sighted in the area just to the southwest of Teterboro.

After scanning the horizon for a period of five minutes the object definitely was not sighted by the unidentified controller.

At one time, at approximately 04443, a very faint amber glow was visible over the ridge just west of the airport but could not be identified as any object flying in that area.
