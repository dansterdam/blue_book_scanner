As per your request, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

To answer the 10 - The sighted object was similar to the sun. It was about 1/3 the size of the sun, and was brighten than the sun. It seemed to be at a great altitude, traveling very rapidly. It appeared stationary for a few seconds, then suddenly burst into tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. I never seen anything like it before. The object was observed for about 10-15 seconds by myself and my wife. I estimated its altitude to be about 10,000-20,000 feet. The object seemed to be round or elliptical in shape, and was a brilliant white or silvery in color. And between the flash which momentary blinded me, I could not detect any fins, wings or other projections from the object. I have no idea what this object could have been. It certainly didn't seem to be any type of conventional aircraft that I am familiar with. I would be interested in your comments on this sighting, and if you care to have more details, I shall be glad to furnish them. I hope this report is of some value to your investigation.

OCR Output:

This is a good piece of footage. We had some very unusual sightings of objects one evening. The familiar saw in the sky below appeared to be about thirty-five yards or so away. As far as I could say, the objects seemed to be moving up and down in a zig-zag fashion, like a fish swimming in the water. Sometimes the objects did not move at all but appeared to merely float without any apparent means of propulsion. I could see very clearly the outline of this object. It was round in shape and bluish-white in color. At the same time, I could see no lights or evidence of any kind of mechanism that would be necessary to lift or propel such an object. I was amazed at what I saw and felt that it could not possibly be an aircraft of any kind. It was definitely not an airplane or a helicopter or anything like that. It definitely did not have the shape or configuration of any conventional type of aircraft. At the time I did not know what to think. Now, in retrospect, I am convinced that what I saw that evening was something out of the ordinary, to put it mildly. I will always remember that experience as I had never seen anything like that before or since. I realize that others who have reported similar sightings are often ridiculed or made to feel that they are strange in some way. I do not wish to be included in that category. All I want to do is describe what I actually saw. I am aware that the subject of UFOs is a controversial one and often a sensitive one. However, I am convinced that what I saw that evening was real and not a figment of my imagination. I would be glad to cooperate with any properly authorized investigative agency that might have an interest in this incident. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to assist in this matter.

Seemed the car too, it had slowed. I didn't have any fear, it didn't frighten me. It seemed like it paused or hovered, then started out very rapidly in a southerly direction. It seemed to take off at a terrific speed. I watched it until it disappeared from sight. It traveled through the dark sky very rapidly. I actually believe I saw a flying saucer. I can give you details about its appearance. It was a disc or ellipse shaped object and had a brightglow around the edges. It made no sound that I could hear. It didn't seem to be anything man-made that I know about. I estimate its size to be at least 50 to 60 feet in diameter. My brother didn't get a good look at it as his attention was on the highway. I turned to him and said "Did you see that?" But he didn't see it. I was slightly disappointed as I would have liked to discuss it with him. Other than that, I don't know what else to say. I wanted to report this to the proper authorities but my brother didn't seem very interested. I'm hoping that by reporting this you can evaluate it and perhaps learn something about what I saw that night. Let me know if you need any further information from me.

Well, as close as I could tell, the object which I observed was a metallic disc, brightly reflective, and somewhat larger than a half moon in the sky. I feel that I have seen this type of object on a number of occasions, and it is my belief that such craft are visitors from outer space. I would judge that the craft was at least several hundred feet in diameter, and it moved with incredible speed, disappearing rapidly into the sky.
