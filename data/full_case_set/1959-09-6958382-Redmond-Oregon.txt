Dear Mr. President: 

Please permit me a little of your busy time to ask on behalf of my organization several questions on matters of concern to us all. On the brink of bursting the erstwhile limits of our spatial horizons, we seek simply the truth about these matters. 
 
1. The official publication of NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, of which Donald E. Keyhoe, Major, USMC, Ret., is Director) refers to an Air Force statement which is contrary to Federal Aviation Agency reports. 

The AF-FAA conflict ion concerns the alleged sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) on September 24, 1959 near Redmond, Oregon. NICAP states that FAA proof of the tacts of the sightings, proof which is officially logged FAA evidence, includes: details of a chase by four AF F-102 Jets, a description of the UFO and an AF report of tracking the object by radar for over one hour. These FAA reports were signed by L. B. Davis, Chief, Redmond Air Traffic Communication Station, and William F. Zauché, Jr., Chief, Air Route Traffic Control Center, Seattle The reports, sent to NICAP, were accompanied by a confirming letter from Eugene S. Kropf, Assistant to the Regional Manager, FAA Region 4, Los Angeles. NICAP states that the FAA reports are at NICAP headquarters in Washington, D.C.. 

NICAP states that on January 19, 1960, it received the following statement, which was signed by Major Lawrence J. Tacker, Pentagon Public Information Officer handling UFO Information: "The ATIC account of the sighting fails to reveal any evidence of radar tracking or any success of the attempted intercept. It is the ATIC opinion that this object was probably a balloon..." 

Mr. President, do you think that the Air Force should be requested to make, immediately, a complete and public explanation of this case?

2.  NICAP has referred to the published statement of Rear Admiral
Delmer S. Fahrney, USN, Ret., famed as the "father of guided missiles,"
which reveals his realization of the necessity to know the facts about
objects which reportedly enter our atmosphere at high speeds.

    Do you respect this man's opinion on this subject?

3.  If our Air Force found that there are some objects -- now referred
to as UFOs -- which originate from planets other than earth, then do
you think the American public, if given such information, would take
that news sensibly and in stride?

4.  Do you think the American public should be told all facts relating
to all unidentified flying objects?

I wish to take this opportunity to thank you in advance for your
courtesy and attention on this.  We are deeply appreciative.  Your reply
will aid us in our fair evaluation of the subjects in question.


                                Most sincerely,
                                [signature and redaction]

UFO SIGHTING
REDMOND, OREGON SIGHTING
24 September 1959

On 24 September 1959, at 12002 (0400 local), Mr Robert Dickerson, a policeman of Redmond, Oregon, sighted an unidentified flying object. Unable to identify the object, Mr. Dickerson drove to the Redmond FAA facility and contacted Mr. Lavern Wertz, operator on duty. Mr Dickerson and Mr. Wertz described the object as an ex*tremely bright light very low on the horizon in the northeastern sky. Both witnesses stated that the object appeared to move erratically around a principal point and to move rapidly toward and away from them. Total observation time was approximately one hour at which time Mr. Wertz stated that the object appeared to zoom straight up at great speed.

After observing the object for several minutes with Mr. Wertz, Officer Dickerson attempted to get closer to the object by driving in an eastward direction. After five miles and no apparent change in the appearance of the object the officer gave up his attempt and Mr. Wertz reported the presence of the object to the FAA Seattle "Bigfoot". The Seattle PAA facility contacted the 827th ACWRON (Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron) located at Keno, Oregon, and asked if they had a target in the Richmand area and the senior controller answered in the affirmative. Six F-102's, one F-89, one H-29 (Helicopter), and one civilian Tri-Pacer equipped with a Geiger counter were vectored to the target area with negative results. The interceptors did not make visual or radar contact, and the Tri-Pacer reported negative radiation. After the unsuccessful intercept, the 25th Air Divition ordered the track number assigned to this target scrubbed.

The UFO report made to ATIC did not contain any information concerning the radar target, but concerned itself only with the visual sighting by Mr. Dickerson and Mr. Wertz. The reason the radar experience was omitted is that the Air Force recognized that the two sightings were really separate events. The FAA log associated the visual and radar sightings. These logs were later made available to Major Donald E. Keyhoe and he attempted to exploit them in an effort to prove that the Air Force was withholding information.

ATIC interviewed Officer Dickerson, Mr. Wertz, and Major Creasman of the 827th ACWRON, and confirmed the fact that the visual and radar sightings were associated only as conincidences. This conversation also narrowed down the direction and elevation, the apparent motions, and the colors and their arrangement associated with the object. From this information it was concluded that the cause for the visual sighting was the refraction of light from the planet Venus. The direction of the planet coincided with thaT reported for the object, and the planet had a stellar magnitude of ---4.2, or about 15 times brighter than the brightest star. At the intial time of the sighting the planet was slightly below the horizon and was brought into view by the bending of light (refraction) by the atmosphere. Inconsistencies in the atmosphere probably caused the object to appear to have radial motion (toward and away from the observer).

The radar return was determined to have been caused by a gap-filler antenna. Under certain atmospheric conditions this antenna appears on the scope of the 827th ACWRON, and has been observed several times since the 24 September 1959 sighting.

At 1500 30 March 1960, Sgt Rolfe, 25th Air Division called to 
report that the gap filler antenna is located close to Lapine, Oregon. 
He also stated that the radar site had seen the same object quite often 
( quite often to mean more than 3 times but less than 10, but no specific 
period for these observations). The site would not commit themselves 
as to whether this gap filler antenna was considered as part of the 
normal background for the station. 
Communication people of the 25th ADIV do not believe th gap filler 
antenna was responsible for the returns, but rather a mountain EXft peak 
which is normally out of range. Targets of this type are typical of 
coastal and mountainous areas, occuring approximately 8 to 10 times a year. 
No additional witnesses, other than the two already reported, could be 
found to confirm the visual sighting. 
 The 327th ACWRON is located at Keno, Oregon. The gap filler 
antenna is located on South Pauline peak. South Peak is 98 nautical miles
WNE of Keno, and 3!> nautical miles south of Redmond Radio . 
In view of the above information, the ATIC feels there is no valid 
reason to change the original AXX&AAXStXX evaluation.

Three other directors who were on duty from 1500 zulu to 2400 zulu on 24 September have been interviewed and recall the following:

1. The radar return bearing track No. JB-129 did not move during this period. 
2. The radar return was in a position close to gap filler the antenna located on a mountain at, 8,010' level.
3. Repeated passes were made by the interceptors at levels from 40,000 down to 12,000 feet. The interceptors being directed through our radar return KB-129. No interceptor received a radar return on his airborne radar. At altitudes below 12,000' msl visual search was conducted under VFR conditions with negative results.
4. Since 24 Sept 1959, several instances have been observed by this Hq wherein no moving radar returns appeared in the same location as those of JB-129. It is their opinion that under certain atmospheric conditions, radar echoes from the gap+jln+   antennas in that location are received.

1. ATIC contacted the 25th Air Division, McChord AFB, Washington, concerning the UFO sighted at Redmond, Oregon 24 September 1959, and requested further investigation be conducted in an effort to discover additional information concerning this case.

2. The 25th Air Division reported that no additional information was available, and that the radar sightings in the area at the time were not considered a part of the UFO sighting.

3. This case is still carried in the ATIC files with its original evaluation of "insufficient evidence".

Redmond, Oregon Sighting - 24 Sept 1959

1. Major Friend, by telephone, contacted Mr Laverne Wertz, FAA,
Redmond, Oregon, Mr Robert Dickerson, policeman, Redmond, Oregon and
Major Creasman, 827th ACWRON, Keno, Oregon. Mr Wertz stated that the
object which was seen at 1200Z (0400 local) was brought to his attention
by officer Dickerson. Wertz and Dickerson both described the object as
an extremely bright light in the northeastern sky, and very low on the
horizon. The object appeared stationary, except for apparent erratic 
motion around its principal points. The object was observed for more 
than one hour. Mr Wertz reported the object to ARTC at Seattle, who in
turn contacted the 827th ACWRON for identification. Interceptors were
scrambled from Seattle and surveyed the area under the control of the
827th. A civilian tri-pacer equipped with a geiger counter was scrambled
from Redmond. The results of all intercept attempts were unsuccessful.

2. Major Creasman, 827th ACWRON informed Major Friend that a similar
object has been observed several times since the 24th of September by
the station’s observers. It is believed at the station that either a 
gap-filler antenna or the terrain is responsible for the returns.

3. On the night of 24 September, Seattle ARTC asked the 827th if they
had a target in the vicinity of Redmond. The operator observing the
returns on the scope answered in the affirmative. It is believed that
this unconfrimed and idle answer was responsible for the FAA report
which stated that the visually observed UFO had radar confirmation by
the GCI site.

4. At the time of the sighting the star Regulus and the planet Venus
are both in the direction of the sighting and just below the horizon.
It is the ATIC opinion that refractions of these objects were probably 
responsible for the visual sighting. The description by the witnesses 
and the fact that the object appeared generally stationary adds credence 
to this conclusion.

5. Col Tacker, SAFOI-3d, informed of ATIC action by telephone 14 June
1960. Col Shoop also briefed this date.

6. The following aircraft were scrambled for intercept and/or search
of this target:

UFO Sighting, Redmond, Oregon

1. On 24 September 59, at 12002, an object was sighted at Redmond, Oregon. The object was described as a bright light, such as a landing light, changing to an orangeish hue. It had four protruding lights: red, green, yellow, and white. The main light hovered at 800’ and then rose to 3000’. The object appeared at 120° elevation and disappeared in flight to the south. The object was in sight off and on for a period of one hour and 49 minutes. The method of observation was ground visual. The entire sighting took place during the hours of darkness. The witnesses were Mr Laverne Wertz, an FAA station operator and Officer Robert Dickerson, Redmond Police Department. The weather at the time of the sighting. High, thin, broken clouds and the wind was of an average velocity of 15 knots generally to the south. The report was submitted by the 1902d AACS at Hamilton AFB, Calif. 

2. It has subsequently been determined that on the night of 24 September the 827th AC&WOT Squadron, Redmond logged a radar target. The following aircraft were scrambled for intercept and/or search of this target.

| # A/C | Type A/C | From | Time Scrambled | Time Down |

```
The radar returns recorded during this period were in a position very
close to a gap-filler antenna located on a mountain at the 8000' level.
No interceptor or other search aircraft received either radar returns or
the airborne radar or made visual contact with the UFO.
3. Since 24 Sept 59, several instances have been observed wherein non-
moving radar returns appeared in the same location as those on 24 Sept 59.
No specific UFO report was made by the 827th ACWRON.
sent a wire to Secretary Dudley Sharp stating that the
object sighted in Oregon on 24 Sept 59, was a space ship powered electro-
magnetically. Mr. stated that this ship made fools of the aircraft
which were scrambled to intercept, and he requested that Secretary Sharp
get the military in line. Major (NICAP) also sent correspondence
to Secretary Sharp; Major having learned of the above described
radar sighting erroneously connected this with the visual sighting on
the same day. This letter also suggests that Secretary got the
military in line. The correspondence from both Mr. and Major
intimate that the Air Force has the true answer to this sighting, but is
not revealing the information.
5. The information provided ATIC concerning the visual sighting 24 Sept 59,
is insufficient for a positive conclusion. The object, if the same object
were seen for one hour and 19 minutes, could possibly have been a balloon.
There is also the possibility, since the object was seen off and on during
the period of the sighting, that the first object seen was a refraction of
the star Canopus, with the interceptors and other aircraft themselves being
responsible for the subsequent sightings. This case is carried as insuffi-
cient evidence in the ATIC files.

fails to reveal any evidence of radar tracking or any success of

direction and strength of the wind at the time of the sighting was
South at 15 knots.

SAPFL 120003

APR 25 1960

Dear Senator Jackson:

This is in response to your inquiry of 5 April 1960 in behalf of
concerning the Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) sighting of 24 September 1959 near Redmond, Oregon. This reply was delayed while due consideration was given to Mr. Harris' letter in Air Force Headquarters.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center's account of this sighting failed to reveal any evidence of radar tracking of the UFO or any success of the attempted intercept. The official Federal Aviation Agency logs from the Air Route Traffic Control Center at Seattle-Tacoma Airport in Washington, and the Redmond Air Traffic Communication Center are misleading. The official log of the Klamath Falls, Oregon, ground-controlled interception site revealed the following.

Upon notification of the sighting of a UFO in the general area, it was assigned the track designation of JB-129. During the active search for this UFO, six F-102 and one F-89 type aircraft were scrambled under control of the Klamath Falls SAGE radar sites. Repeated passes were made by the interceptors between 40,000 and 12,000 feet. A T-33 Pacer aircraft and an R-19 helicopter conducted a low altitude search. In addition, a B-47 Strategic Air Command aircraft from Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, was in the area. All the aircraft returned to bases with visual and radar negative results.

The radar return bearing track No. JB-129 on the Klamath Falls ground-controlled interception station was not an unidentified flying object. It was determined by the four senior controllers on duty during the period of the search that this radar return on the ground control scope was a radar echo from a gap filler antenna located on a mountain at the 8500-foot level. This radar return did not move during the entire period of the search. This has been further substantiated since 24 September 1959 on several occasions when a similar radar return appeared in the same location. A careful analysis reveals under specific atmospheric conditions a nonmoving radar echo from the gap filler antenna is reflected on the ground-controlled interception scope. The fact that this radar return did not move is in complete disagreement with ground observers who sighted the UFO visually. They all testified it maneuvered rapidly and at times hovered.

Letter to Honorable Henry M. Jackson (Cont)

In view of the fact that the radar return on the Klamath Palls
scone wee promptly Identified as not being the erratic moving UFO, 
no UFO report was submitted by the Klamath Falls station or the 25th
Air Division, MeChord Air Force Base, Washington. Therefore, after
notification by the Federal Aviation Agency of this UFO, no mention
was made at that time of a radar Bighting, the report submitted by
Hamilton Air Force Basel California, to the Air Technical Intelligence
Center, stated the manner of observation was "ground visual." The re-
suiting analysis showed there vas insufficient data to allow a valid
evaluation or conclusion.

The Air Pores investigates all UFO sightings in meticulous detail
and all data available is used in the final revaluation. She investiga-
tion at the UFO phenomenon has been placed in responsible hands which
 Include civilian scientists and consultants and an adequate, thorough
 and honest program is being conducted.

The Air Force informed the National Investigations Committee on
 25 March 1960 of all the facts and findings in connection with t h e
particular UFO sighting. Charges that the Air Force is withholding
information from the public on the subject of unidentified flying ob-

        This is in response to your inquiry of 21 April 1960 in behalf
of Mr. [redacted] concerning unidentified flying objects (UFO).

        On 25 March 1959 the Air Force informed the National
Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) of all the facts
and findings in connection with UFO sightings near Redmond, Oregon. I
talked with Mr. [redacted] [redacted] and expressed an interest. The Air Defense Technical
Intelligence Center (ADTC) account of this sighting fails to reveal
any evidence of radar tracking of the UFO or any success of the Air
Force interceptors.

        Upon notification of the sighting of an UFO in the general area,
it was assigned the track designation of JB-129. During the active
search for this UFO, six F-102 type aircraft and one F-89 type air-
craft were scrambled under control of Klamath Falls and Kebeo
radar sites. Expected passes were made by the interceptors between
40,000-foot and 12,000-foot level. A T-33 type aircraft and H-19
helicopter conducted a low altitude search. In addition, an F-47
Strategic Air Command aircraft from Mountain Home Air Force Base in
Idaho was in the area. All of the above returned to bases with
negative visual and radar results. The radar return bearing track
number JB-129 on the Klamath Falls ground-controlled interception
(GCI) station was not an unidentified flying object. It was deter-
mined by the four senior controllers on duty during the period of the
search that this radar return on the ground station scope was a tran-
sient front a gap filler antenna located on a mountain at the 8,100-
foot level. This radar return did not travel during the entire period
of the search. This has been further substantiated since 24 September
1959 on several occasions when a similar radar return appeared in the
same location. A careful check has shown that under specific atmos-
pheric conditions a strong radar echo from the gap filler antenna
is reflected on the GCI scope. The fact that this radar return did
not move is in complete agreement with ground observers who sighted
the UFO visually. They all testified it maneuvered rapidly and at
times hovered.

Ltr to Hon Samuel S. Stratton (Cont)

In view of the fact that the radar return on the Klamath Falls scope was vaguely identified as not being an aircraft-mowing UFO, an UFO report was submitted by the Klamath Falls station of the 25th Air Division at McChord Air Force Base. Therefore, after notification by the FAA of the UFO (no mention was made at that time of a radar sighting), the report submitted by the 1902nd Airways and Air Communications Squadron at Hamilton Air Force Base, California, in accordance with paragraph 16 (c) 1 of Air Force Regulation 200-2, stated the manner of observation was "ground visual," later reading stated showed "there was insufficient data to allow a valid investigation or evaluation."

Copies of the information contained in the FAA logs have been forwarded to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center for possible additional considerations. An Air Force will commence with the Klamath Falls GCI and the 25th Air Division at McChord Air Force Base to again verify the above-mentioned facts and, should any additional evidence warrant a change in the evaluation category for this particular sighting, press release will be made. Based upon all the present data on this sighting, the finding of "insufficient data" is definitely valid.

The Air Force investigates all UFO sightings in meticulous detail and all the data available were used in the final evaluation. The investigation of the UFO phenomena is being conducted by responsible persons, including civilian scientists and consultants, and a complete, objective, thorough and honest process is being conducted. Charges that the Air Force is withholding UFO information from the general public are unfounded and have no basis in fact.

We appreciate your interest in this matter and trust that the information furnished will be of assistance to you.

Sincerely yours,

Signed

WASHINGTON 6, D. C.
December 31, 1959

Major Lawrence J. Tacker
Department of the Air Force
Office of Public Information
Pentagon,
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Major Tacker: 

It was reported in local papers and on the newswires that a UFO was seen on the morning of September 24th by a police patrolman and an FAA flight service specialist in Redmond, Oregon. The regional FAA office in Seattle, Washington, reported that the object was tracked on radar for about two hours, and that Air Force jets were scrambled from Portland Air Base on an attempted intercept.

In view of the radar tracking and the involvement of FAA and Air Force personnel, I assume that ATIG has studied the case. What is the conclusion of ATIG? 

Secondly, you mentioned earlier this year that the Air Force Project Twinkle had considered the possibility that the so-called "green fireballs" were ice meteorites. Their conclusions had not been released at the time, but you said the project would close down this year. Since -- theories along the same line, in Air Force magazine and elsewhere, are claiming that most UFOs are explainable as chunks of ice from space, we would like to have the official Air Force position on this matter, including the conclusions of Project Twinkle.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,
[signed]
Secretary of NICAP

----
**March 19, 1960**

**The Honorable Dudley C. Sharp,**
**Secretary of the Air Force,**
**The Pentagon,**
**Washington 25, D. C.**

**My dear Mr. Secretary:**

As requested by members of the NICAP Board of Governors, I am forwarding photo-copies of two Federal Aviation Agency logs showing a report of a UFO sighted and tracked by radar over Oregon on Sept. 24, 1959. As you will see by the accompanying letter from FAA Regional Director of Region 4, these logs were officially released to NICAP at our request.

Also enclosed is a photo-copy of a letter from your official UFO spokesman, Major Lawrence J. Tacker, in which he admits that the UFO was tracked by radar and gives the ATIC opinion that the object was a balloon.

In view of the official FAA evidence, the balloon answer is clearly impossible. No balloon maneuvers, zigzags or fires off exhaust from its base, as described; nor could any aerial object attain the high speeds or carry out the described maneuvers which occurred before, during and after the approach of the Air Force F 102 interceptor fighter.

Major Tacker, acting as the official spokesman for the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, states that ATIC labeled this report "insufficient evidence." It would appear that this label was assigned an an extreme contrast with impressive radar sighting. The detailed evidence was clearly delineated and officially reported by expert FAA observers, Air Force F-102 pilots, three AF GCI radar operators at Klamath Falls and a Redmond city policeman.

By Air Force Regulation 200-2, such UFO reports must be sent immediately by electrical means to neighboring, centers or radar to ATIC, Air Defense, and the nearest Air Defense Aviation. The pattern of ATIC intelligence, said to be part of Project. The regulation states that "such messages be the same priority as emergency'. this obviously must have been known through the preliminary reports and follow up investigations, that very short time. We will add that the Federal Aviation Agency states the Air Force was promptly informed.

Since the FAA, Klamath Falls GCI and F-102 pilots' reports

must have gone to the Secretary’s office, as required, than this detailed information must have been available to Major Tacker, the spokesman officially designated to inform the press and the public in regard to UFOs.

We realize this sighting occurred before you became Secretary of the Air Force. But we are sure that now, as Secretary, you will wish to investigate this release of misleading information, as contained in Major Tacker’s letter to NICAP dated Jan. 19, 1960.

Summing up, we believe the following points proved beyond any question:

1. The FAA observers’ Pagged glowing the OBO, its strange tongue of light or fire, the exhaust of flame from its base, its alternating hovering and rapid maneuvers, and its swift escape from the AF jets all combine to prove this object was not a balloon.

2. The official FAA statements prove that, contrary to the January 19th AP denial, the UFO was tracked for over 90 minutes by GCI radar operators, which the AF has in the past described as highly expert.

3. The AF was fully aware that its own and the FAA evidence proved this was some unknown device under intelligent control.

4. The spokesman in the Secretary's office deliberately gave NICAP a false answer, or was supplied a false answer by ATIC to be given to NICAP; further, that either the spokesman or ATIC, or both, were following a prescribed Air Force policy of hiding the facts from the public - a policy set by Air Force Headquarters or by a higher authority.

We respectfully request that we be informed why NICAP was given this misleading answer and if this represents a continuing AF policy. We also note that the latest AF “fact sheet” states that the 70 UFO reports in the last half of 1959 were dismissed with the label "insufficient Evidence.”’ We request that the AF reports in the Redmond case and in these other 69 cases be submitted to a special NICAP subcommittee for evaluation, the conclusions to be released to the press and newscasting media.

The subcommittees would include Capt. R. B. McLaughlin, USN, Navy guided missile authority, | ° President of the Association of American Engineers, Mejjor Dewey Fournét, USAFR, former Pentagon monitor of the Air Force UFO project, Luis Book, Col. R. J. Emerson, U.S. Army Reserve, head of Emerson Testing Laboratories, Cef George Anthony, Pan American Airways, and several engineers and scientists whose names will be available to you after receipt of the requested reports.

The Hon. Dudley C. Sharp. Page three.

In 1957, NICAP -- created as a non-profit organization to determine and make public the facts about UFOs -- offered Secretary Douglas, your predecessor, an eight-point plan of cooperation, including an offer to aid in preparing the American public for later disclosures about the flying objects. We now repeat our offer of cooperation and urge that you give it your serious personal consideration.

We believe that the public interest is best served by honest official statements disclosing the full details of all UFO cases investigated by the U.S. Air Force, and that concealing the facts will only arouse public suspicion and possibly wide alarm.

SAPOI-34/Maj Tucker/mhb/72291

25 March 1960

Dear Major [Redacted],

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of 19 March 1960 addressed to Secretary Sharp concerning the unidentified flying object sighting of 24 September 1959 near Redmond, Oregon. Your letter has been referred to this office for reply.

As mentioned in my previous letter of 19 January 1960, the ATIC account of this sighting fails to reveal any evidence of radar tracking of the UFO or any success of the attempted intercept.

The official Federal Aviation Agency logs from the Air Route Traffic Control Center at Seattle-Tacoma Airport and the Redmond Air Traffic Communication Center are misleading. The official log of the Klamath Falls GCI site reveals the following:

Upon notification of the sighting of a UFO in the general area, it was assigned the track designation of J3-129. During the active search for this UFO (1300 Z to 2155 Z) six F-102 type aircraft and one F-89 type aircraft were scrambled under control of Klamath Falls and Mt. Hebo radar sites. Repeated passes were made by the interceptors between 40,000’ and 12,000’ level. A Tri Pacer aircraft and a H-19 helicopter conducted a low altitude search. In addition, a B-47 SAC aircraft from Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho was in the area. All of the aircraft returned to bases with visual and radar negative results. The radar return bearing track number J3-129 on the Klamath Falls GCI station was not an unidentified flying object. It was determined by the four senior controllers on duty during the period of the search that this radar return on the GCI scope was a radar echo from a gap filler antenna located on a mountain at the 8,000’ level. This radar return did not move during the entire period of the search. This has been further substantiated since 24 September 1959 on several occasions when a similar radar return appeared in the same location. A careful check has shown that under specific atmospheric conditions a non-moving radar echo from this gap filler antenna is reflected on the GCI scope. The fact that this radar return did not move is in complete disagreement with ground observers who sighted the UFO visually. They all testified it maneuvered rapidly and at times hovered.

SAFOI-34/MB/Jacker/mbh/72291

19 January 1960

Dear Mr **********

This is to acknowledge your letter of 31 December requesting various facts concerning unidentified flying objects as investigated by the United States Air Force.

The Portland, Oregon UFO sighting of 24 September 1959 is carried on the records of ATIC as "Insufficient Information." The ATIC account of the sighting fails to reveal any evidence of radar tracking or any success of the attempted intercept. It is the ATIC opinion that this object was probably a balloon as evidenced by its relatively long period in the area (more than an hour), and the fact that unless equipped with reflectors balloons are not good radar reflectors. The average direction and strength of the wind at the time of sighting was south at 15 knots.

Project Twinkle was discontinued in the last quarter of the calendar year 1951. The conclusions from the project were that unusual phenomena could be attributed to such man-made objects as airplanes, balloons, rockets, etc; others were attributed to natural phenomena such as flying birds, small clouds and meteorites. There was no mention in the conclusions as to the specific composition of "green fireballs."

ATIC is familiar with the theory of Dr. Donald Robey concerning the composition of "green fireballs," but as yet these theories have not been substantiated. Air Force studies of meteors have not revealed any data which would lead to similar conclusions as those proposed by Dr. Robey.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER Major, USAF Public Information Division Office of Information

```
in view of the fact that the radar return on the Klamath Falls 
scope was properly identified as not being the currently moving UFO, 
no UFO report was submitted by the Klamath Falls station of the 
25th Alr Division at McChord Air Force Base. Therefore, after 
notification by the FAA of this UFO (no notation was made at that 
time of a radar sighting), the report submitted by the 1906th AACS 
at Hamilton Air Force Base, California, to ATIC, in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (c ) 1 of AFR 200-2, stated the manner of observation was 
"ground visual." The resulting analysis showed there was insufficient 
data to allow a valid valuation or conclusion.

However, because of the information contained in the FAA log, 
your correspondence and the copies of the logs have been forwarded to 
ATIC for possible additional consideration. ATIC will contact the 
Klamath Falls CGI site and the 25th Air Division at McChord Air Force 
Base to again verify the above mentioned facts and, should any additional 
evidence warrant a change in the evaluation category for this particular 
sighting, ATIC will be informed immediately and a press release will be 
made simultaneously. Based upon all the present data on this sighting, 
the finding of "insufficient data" is definitely valid.

The Air Force investigates all UFO sightings in meticulous detail 
and all the data available is used in the final evaluation. The 
investigation of the UFO phenomena has been placed in responsible hands 
which include civilian scientists and consultants and an adequate, 
thorough and honest program is being conducted. Charges that the Air 
Force is withholding UFO information from the general public are un- 
founded and have no basis in fact.

For your information I am sending copies of this letter to Mr. 
Eugene Krrof, Assistant to the Regional Manager of FAA Region 1, and 
Mr. of

AIR FORCE CONTRADICTS 
FAA REPORT 
A new letter denying a Federal 
Aviation Agency (FAA) report that a 
UFO sighted last September 24 in 
Redmond, Oregon, was tracked by AF 
radar men, is being circulated by 
the Air Force. FAA observers had 
watched the rapidly maneuvering UFO 
and reported it to the Air Force. 
After AF radar confirmed the sight- 
ing on FAA call 158, jets were ham- 
mered in search of the object. The FAA 
logs state that AF radar was still 
tracking it at over 13,000 miles per 
hour, when it vanished, first from 
6000 to 54,000 feet. The new AF 
letter states that the G31 radar 
men were fooled by a blip from a 
stationary antenna on a nearby hill- 
top which "was promptly identified 
as not being the erratic moving UFO." 
New information obtained by NICAP 
confirms the original FAA reports. 

The Air Force letter was released 
following a NICAP letter to FAA 
Secretary Dudley Sharp asking for 
an explanation of the disparity in 
statements, and enclosing copies of

Wertz described it as round and flat;

flame. They claimed that it hovered over 
the area for at least an hour. Wertz also 
told the press that the Seattle FAA au-

on a radar screen for about two hours 
at altitudes of 6000 to 54,000 feet, and 
that jet interceptors dispatched from 
Portland Air base failed to catch the 
object which vanished in clouds at about 
14,000 feet. Wert also quoted FAA auth-

NICAP Letter (Mr 

1. The Portland, Oregon UFO sighting of 24 September 1959, is carried on the records of ATIC as "insufficient information". The ATIC account of the sighting fails to reveal any evidence of radar tracking or any success of the attempted intercept. It is the ATIC opinion that this object was probably a ballon as evidenced by its relatively long period in the area (more than an hour), and the fact unless equipped with reflectors balloons are not sood radar reflectors. The average direction and strength of the wind at the time of the sighting was about 15 knots.

2. Project Twinkle was discontinued in the last quarter of the calendar year 1951. The conclusions from the project were that unusual phenomena could be attributed to man-made objetcs as airplanes, balloons, rockets, etc; others were attributed to natural phenomena such as flying birds, small clouds and meteorites. There was no mention in the conclusions as to the specific composition of "green fireballs".

3. ATIC is familiar with the theory of Dr. Donald Robey concerning the composition of "green Fireballs," but as yet these theories have nor been substantiated. Air Force studies of meteors have not revealed any data which would lead to similar conclusions as those proposed by Dr Robey.

NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE
ON AERIAL PHENOMENA
WASHINGTON 6, D.C.
December 31, 1959

Major Lawrence J. Tacker
Department of the Air Force
Office of Public Information
Pentagon,
Washington 25, D.C.


Dear Major Tacker:

It was reported in local papers and on the newswires that
a UFO was seen on the morning of September 24th by a police
patrolman and an FAA flight service specialist in Redmond,
Oregon. The regional FAA office in Seattle, Washington,
reported that the object was tracked on radar for about two
hours, and that Air Force jets were scrambled from Portland
Air Base on an attempted intercept.

In view of the radar-tracking and the involvement of FAA
and Air Force personnel, I assume that ATIC has studied the
case. What is the conclusion of ATIC?

Secondly, you mentioned earlier this year that the Air Force
Project Twinkle had considered the possibility that the so-called
"green fireballs" were ice meteorites. Their conclusions had
not been released at the time, but you said the project would 
close down this year. Since Donald Robey's theories along the
same line, in Air Force magazine and elsewhere, are claiming
that most UFOs are explainable as chunks of ice from space,
we would like to have the official Air Force position on this
matter, including the conclusions of Project Twinkle.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,

Secretary of NICAP

Dear Sir:

____

I would like to know ATIC's conclusions on the UFO seen over Newark, N.J. Airport and vicinity on July 11th. Were jet fighters scrambled to intercept the UFO and did control tower operators observe the object on radar?

Would also like to know ATIC's conclusions on the Mantell and Redmond, Oregon cases. (Oregon sighting was on Sept. 21, 1950). In the Redmond case, was the UFO tracked on radar and were jet fighters scrambled?
