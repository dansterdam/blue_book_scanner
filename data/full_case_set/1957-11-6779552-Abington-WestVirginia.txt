To night the earth seems motionless to me as I look up and suddenly realized - as I was sitting looking up at the clear sky watching the stars with our boys - that the earth must be ploughing its way through space at thousands of miles per hour with no perceptible motion and this as wonderful to me tonight as any strange sighting in the sky could possibly be.
