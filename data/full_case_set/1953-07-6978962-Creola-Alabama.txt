AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

STATION:  Brockley Air Force Base, Alabama
DATE:  17 August 1953
SUBJECT:  No sounds were observed with this object and the duration of sighting was less than a minute.  Individuals did not see or hear any aircraft noises or unusual sounds at the time of the sighting.  Approximate location of objects was southeast of the observers - believed to be 30 degrees above the horizon.

On 17 August 1953 at 2035 hours local time, two objects were observed looking like a bright reddish glow heading from the north to the south and paralleling a pre-existing cloud condition.  The objects were a single object for the first part of the sighting and then separated into two objects.  They were observed for a short period of time, estimated at less than a minute, and the sighting was terminated when the objects disappeared behind some rising clouds.  There was no sound associated with this object during the time of the sighting.  There was no radar detection or other means of confirming this object.

Reliability of observer is as stated above.

No interruption was encountered since the sighting was late in being reported.

The weather is reported as in Inclosure #7.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Intelligence Officer
Reports Creola Air Force Base, Alabama 

Details: At approximately 1900 CDT, 25 August 1953, the 17934 Air Intelligence Officer received a report from Mrs. G.S. Kiner, telephone number Citronelle, Alabama, which report is as follows:

On 25 August 1953, at approximately 1750 CDT, Mrs. Kiner, who resides approximately 4 miles west of Creola, Alabama, was on her way home from a church meeting with her sister. As they neared Creola, they observed a strange object in the sky at an estimated altitude of 3000 feet. The object was about the size of a B-29 at that distance, and appeared to be intensely illuminated and glowing. It was a yellowish-white color, and maintained a steady glow. There was no sound associated with the object.

The object was observed for 3 to 5 minutes, during which time it maintained a constant altitude and slowly drifted from west to east. After reaching a position approximately over Creola, the object suddenly accelerated at a terrific speed and disappeared from view. The Intelligence Officer of the 17934 AIR conducted an investigation and obtained the following statements from the observers:

No A-2 Aircraft were in the area at the time of the sighting. The object was not reflections, mirages, or any other known natural phenomena. The object was not identifiable as any known type of aircraft, and bore no resemblance to anything the observers had ever seen before. The length of time the object was observed and the manner in which it accelerated and disappeared indicate it was not an aircraft. The observers are intelligent, rational, and sincere persons, and have no reason to fabricate or exaggerate this report. Reliability 3-3.

The above report is forwarded without recommendation or evaluation. No further information is available.

Dear Capt. Harding:

We have been so busy with the Black Hawk, S. Dakota case that I've only just now managed to get to your letter of 27 July which enclosed the various reports. My study of these unrelated reports may not say that compared with Black Hawk, none of these approaches its interest. There are a few interesting sightings, but on none of these is the information sufficient to make a follow-up practicable.

Of the interesting ones, the very similar sightings of 24 July and 1 August at Cody, Wyoming, followed up 11 days later, were more recent with present information. I have no suggested explanation.

The 26 July sightings also show possible interest from the standpoint of time and the fact they were observed from the Control Tower and by aircraft.

It is too bad there is not more information on Creola, Ala. These cases cover four or more days, but there is possibly pay dirt in these.

Finally, the Stillman sighting is definitely puzzling and will probably have to remain unexplained. 

As for the remaining 30 or so, there is so little information concerning some of these which do not have obvious explanations that there is no purpose to be served in considering them further.

Thus, out of the total number there are 8 independent acts which, if staff and time were available, would be interesting to pursue. Personally, I vote for sticking with the Black Hawk case until we have squeezed it dry.

Concerning the Black Hawk case, we are proceeding slowly but surely with the investigation. Solid objects are certainly indicated by the evidence, and considerable foreign interest has been aroused. I will let you know of progress, and a preliminary report is planned on this case for you soon.

CREOLA, ALABAMA 

On or about 21 July 1953 at 20:00-20:30 I  local time, approximately 
way home from work on Highway 45 in Creola, Alabama. I saw what appeared to 
be a metallic, disc-shaped object hovering in the sky. It seemed to be 
about 40-50 feet in diameter and 15-20 feet thick. The object moved slowly 
across the windshield of my vehicle. I could not make out any shapes or
details of the object. For a brief moment it appeared to stop and then
continued on its way. The object moved at a speed that was far in excess of 
any jet aircraft I had ever seen. I pulled off the highway and stopped to 
observe it further but it disappeared from view. The sighting lasted for
about 2-3 minutes. I could not associate it with any known aircraft. The
stability and speed of the object were such that this estimatin was not a star or
planet or any known type of aircraft. There was no sound and only a few clouds and bright
stars.

The report's Security Officer L.R.T.S. Range, Woomera states that on 22nd September, 1952, a "Flying Saucer" was observed over Woomera. The report provides details about the sighting, including that the object was bright and visible for several seconds as it traversed the sky. It also mentions that four people were able to see the phenomenon before it was obscured by the projector tower. The report indicates that the time of the sighting was around 2100 hours.

Statement of Capt. A.F.P. D.I.D. WOOMERA, made at 1910 hours, 29th September, 1952, and taken by Assistant Security Officer, WOOMERA.
I was with during the WOOMERA "West Open Air Theatre" on Saturday, 27th September. 
At between 2045 and 2130 hours I happened to look up and my arm and said, "Look at the rocket!" I looked and directly right from my seat on the left front under the projector and objects objected directly in line with each other. The rocket-shaped object was traveling at a tremendous speed and the object next to it had a chain-shaped object attached to it. The colour of the objects was whitish and the exhaust of flames to the back were yellowish or orange. 
I have had three or four ideas of the object since the incidents. I will summarized it, the object was fuming or emitting a flame and the object seemed to float along with the rocket. The time elapsed would be three seconds.
I have observed fast acrobatics and shooting stars. This object was travelling on an even steady course, faster than any shooting star I have seen, and the trail of flame seemed to be wider than any shooting star trailing behind it. This object was travelling horizontally south-west.

Statement of M. McCAHEY, attached to D.I.D. WOOMERA, taken at 2010 hours, 28th September, 1952, by J.M. McCAHEY, Assistant Security Officer, WOOMERA.

I accompanied[redacted] on 29th September, 1952, to the Woomera Test Open Air Theatre at about 2010 hours. At about 2030 hours we were seated on the left side of the theatre, facing the screen, and about third of the distance from the screen. A movement in the right hand corner of the theatre attracted our attention. I observed an object which appeared to be hovering or stationary. The object slowly descended until it appeared to be about 250 yards from us. It was moving on an even keel, horizontally from north-west to south-west, and at a height which I estimate to be about 1000 feet. The whole object had a whitish grey colour, the size appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and seemed to be cigar-shaped. It was moving on an even keel, horizontally from north-west to south-west, and at a height which I estimate to be about 1000 feet.

The object had moved some distance before I judged it to be about 1 mile away. I said "Do you see that?" The object then appeared to accelerate and disappear.  

The object was travelling faster than any jet aircraft I have seen. It is difficult to estimate the speed, especially at night.

I can only compare this object to any whether this object was an earthly object, but it was of a strange configuration and a strange colour, which did not appear to be any aircraft that I know of.

I have discussed this incident with m. because we have room for improvement today and a rough sketch which was not observed.

Statement of W...., S.J.V., D.I.D., "YOOMERA", taken at 1850 hours 20th September, 1952, by J.A. McGAHEY, Assistant Security Officer.

I was one of a party of four D.I.D. personnel who attended the "Yoomera" test on Saturday, 27th September. There were two pilots and two others. I have just arrived up here myself. Statements by the others will give the full details.

Some time after the show started, S... (that's his name), turned me on to the general direction of the object. Looking towards the right of the screen and in the sky, I could see the object moving. It appeared to be travelling at a tremendous rate of speed towards the right of the screen and in the sky. I would estimate its speed to be in the vicinity of 1000 m.p.h. It was shaped like a silver dollar and seemed to be a solid object metal in appearance. As it was travelling from West to East, it passed across my field of vision in a horizontal manner, that is, maintaining a level course. It was visible for only a matter of seconds.

The calling in at the time as the object did was in a horizontal way. I would say the object was relative to the screen only a matter of seconds, that is, a flash. I did not hear any noise as the picture show may have drowned any.

Concerning the object, in my opinion it would definitely be something other than a shooting star or anything from the heavens.
