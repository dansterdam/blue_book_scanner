estimated that this was caused by a change in attitude in flight.
e.g. rumbling, etc. The object appeared to be traveling at about
one-fourth the speed of "shooting stars" or a soom craft is what
one observer estimated. The rest of the case is missing.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Colonel Norton
SUBJECT: UFOB

At 0900, 1 October 1958, I received a telephone call from Maj. 1st Class F. L. Martin of the Security Office, Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville, Alabama, 345-11.
He reported that a Mr. Christiansen, an employee of Redstone Arsenal in the Structure and Mechanics Lab, sighted an unidentified flying object between 2215 and 2230 local time on 25 September 1958 while examining circuit breakers.
Mr. Christiansen observed two bright lights, about the size of a full moon. There were two smaller lights, about 1/50th the size of the larger ones, following the larger ones. The lights were blinking. The larger ones reported the lander sequence of events lasting about seven seconds.
