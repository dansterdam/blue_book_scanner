1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 20 NOV. 66 2100/2302
2. LOCATION: NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK
3. SOURCE: CIVILIAN
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: AIRCRAFT(POSSIBLE) AIRPORS 7/8

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: GROUND VISUAL
7. COURSE: VARIED
8. PHOTOS: NO
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: NO
10. CONCLUSION: AIRCRAFT (POSSIBLE) AIRPORS 7/8
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched an octagonal object with lights blink on and off. The object seemed to be flying close together with two other objects, "stated one was blinking on and off". Another witness saw a plate-flying object which seemed to be just over the buildings. Also, the descriptions are consistent with that of an observed astronomical object.

and beside the car. She evidently has taken notice of the strange light in the sky. It seems to be about the size of a football and oval shaped, and give off a steady glow or light. She did not notice any sound or see it move. Other than that, there is nothing unusual to report except that these strange lights seem to be appearing more frequently in this area.

Observations on distance: Estimated to be a mile or more distance.

There is one point that I do not understand fully. This is because the object was sometimes obscured by trees and this made it difficult to estimate size accurately. The object seemed to be very large when visible clearly above the trees.

That as I was down at Sandy Hook oner evening - it was very soight - anouther looking evening - it was around 10:45 PM - Just as I looked up I noticed something brighter than any of the stars I have ever seen - This object was perfectly round and glowed a bluish-white color - it was very bright and alomost dove shaped - it came toward me at a very fast speed and then it slowed down considerably and just hovered there for a few minutes - then it took off at a tremendous rate of speed and went straight up into the sky - the whole thing was only visible to me for about 2 to 3 minutes - I would not have a plane or a meteor for that matter - as it was a controlled object - it seemed to stop on a dime and take off at such a rapid rate of speed - I saw it around the New York and New Jersey area - it was a very bright color like nothing I have ever seen before.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing handwritten text.

The OCR output of the text on the page is as follows:

The object came from the north, moving at a very high rate of speed, appeared very large and shiny, called the subject object. It came from north towards the building, came for a short distance, turned around and went back in the direction it came from. Through the night, the phone calls were made to the police station about this object, but this was the only sighting of the object. But reports of this object came back in saying that the city went high on security, and security guards were on the lookout for anything strange that may be coming in the area. There was no expected light at this point, and no flight plans to our knowledge, so by the coming chaos it could just be an unexpected object flying by.

Para 3 Continuod: Then the mamoth plane came from the north at a shorp 900 angle and came at the building. We began to feel I had called the Pentagon and I thought it was one of our planes that had come to see what this was. It seems as if it was coming at us so we ran inside, out of the windows.

After this happened, the other two objects terminated west. Pentagon again (I always got the Command Post) and told they happened and thanked him for getting our plane out so fast. I don't go out at night. Those things are so enormous you can't count them. I can't sleep. I 42 pounds since Nov 20 when I first sighted them.
