The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, containing handwritten text.

Performing OCR on the text:

There were at least 6 men and 1 woman officer on board. Book number 10 of the air force was on board and being hauled with the boat. However, the officer in charge did not seem to be taking it seriously and only scanned it briefly. He seemed more interested in getting the boat going in proper direction.

The boat was (scheduled) to leave at 6:30 P.M. so it was obviously a hurried affair. I am sure the fat Boston could supply directions, but just a boat was rapidly outfitting and offloading mostly gear - nothing could be seen or discovered under those circumstances. In short, the whole affair was most casual and the officer on the boat was only a short time in the position his rank would indicate was proper. It is significant that the patrol who picked up the object was some distance from the position where the object was first seen.

THE OBJECTS WHICH WERE SIGHTED WERE UNUSUAL IN APPEARANCE AND THEIR ACTIONS WERE UNUSUAL. MR. RICHARD CANNING AND MR. RICHARD HAGEN, WHO WERE THE WITNESSES, ARE RELIABLE PERSONS WHO HAVE HAD PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE IN OBSERVING CELESTIAL PHENOMENA AND JUDGING DISTANCES AND SIZES OF OBJECTS IN THE SKY. THEY REPORTED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE DISC-SHAPED, LUMINESCENT, AND MADE EXTREMELY RAPID MANEUVERS. THEY WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES ON 22 JULY 52 FROM 0424Z TO 0444Z AND WERE SEEN BY SEVERAL OTHER RESIDENTS OF COLORADO SPRINGS, COLO.

IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED TO A UNITED STATES AIR FORCE BASE. THIS IS THE INITIAL SIGHTING AS FAR AS IS KNOWN. SUBSEQUENT SIGHTINGS OF SIMILAR OBJECTS IN THE SAME AREA HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY OTHER RELIABLE WITNESSES, BUT DETAILS ARE STILL BEING VERIFIED.

CONFIDENTIAL SECURITY INFORMATION

DETAILS:
1. This investigation opened at the direction of the District Commander, 12th District CID, regarding sightings of an unidentified aerial object by Mr. and Mrs. NEW MEXICO.

AT ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO
2. On 21 July 1952, Mr. NEW MEXICO, Roswell, New Mexico, was interviewed in the Hilton Hotel, Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

About 2355 hours, last Friday night, 18 July 1952, my daughter and I were blick in the back yard of our home, five miles East of Roswell, when we observed a luminous object about 1,000 yards from our home, hovering at about 3,000 feet altitude. It appeared to be elliptical-shaped, glowing object which was about the size of a saucer. It hovered in this position for about 20 to 30 seconds, made a 90° turn to the South and accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object did not appear to make any sound that we could hear. We did not see it return.

Its attitude appeared to remain constant. My daughter and I had been observing stars in that direction for some time previously, and this object was in our line of sight. Its duration of observation was about one (1) minute. It was not a star or anything like that which we had ever seen before. Immediately after the object disappeared, we could still observe the stars in that direction.

3. An Aeronautical Chart was furnished-Mr. NEW MEXICO, which he used to indicate the location and direction of the object. From this chart, it appeared the object was at a point approximately 35° 18' North, 105° 30' West, which point is approximately 5 miles due East of Roswell, New Mexico.

TO: Commanding Officer

Bolling Air Force Base
Washington 25, D.C.
ATTN: Director of Intelligence

1. This is to confirm the telephone call made to the Director of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF, by an agent of this office on 23 July 1952. In this telephone call, information was relayed which was received from Special Agent FRANCIS B. LOLIVETTE of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

2. According to Special Agent LOLIVETTE, two (2) former Air Force military policemen, WILLIAM C. ADAMS and MACK JONES, Roanoke, Virginia, were traveling on Highway 221 near Centersville, Virginia, early in the morning of 19 July 1952. While traveling, their mobile (which is owned by ADAMS) was struck by an object which apparently fell from the automobile ahead of them. This object left marks on the automobile and had a metallic appearance. The object was of an unusual size, shape, and significance, giving rise to speculation at the time, and a local investigation showed that it fell from the unusual type of aircraft. Upon arriving in Washington, they heard about the unconventional type of aircraft supposedly monitored whatever the object which hit their car had fallen from such aircraft. They have compared this incident to several previous threats of irregular activities, and they are keeping this matter under close surveillance for examination.

3. This office is referring this matter to you for whatever action you might deem appropriate. The Office of Special Investigations is not taking any further action.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

1. Mrs reported that on the night of 27 July 1952, at 2012 LST, while sitting in a darkened room in her second story home, she observed an object in the sky which first appeared as a crescent shape and then began to take on an oblong shape. As first sighting the object appeared to be the letters oblong shape and then began to change shape.

2. The object, in the oblong form, emitted a steady glow varying in color and was moving around it and rapidly changing each change took a few seconds or a minute in the course of its motions. The object appeared to be lower than the airplanes she had noted flying that night. She stated the object appeared to be larger than the airplanes she had noted.

3. Following is the weather at time of observation: Visibility 7 miles, light and variable, and 20 miles.

COMMENT BY PREPARING OFFICER

Mrs. was interviewed in person and was interrogated personally the next morning. She appeared to have a good recollection and was rational, composed and lucid. She had lived in different parts of the United States until coming to Hawaii in 1947. She stated that while living in Michigan she had observed numerous falling stars and had seen lights and phenomena which were not similar to any airborne object sighted that night.
