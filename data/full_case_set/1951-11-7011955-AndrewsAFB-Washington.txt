To: All concerned 
Subject: Strange Object Reported by a Capital Air Lines Pilot to GCA Tower.

At 0230 EST Washington an alert was given and we asked if J had seen any strange
aircraft or objects flying around Andrews. A strange object was reported to us about 20 miles at 8,000 feet. This object was reported not to be a star because
of the brilliant light that it carried. Several other lights were seen on it later.
When this object reached Capital City for 20 to 25 minutes and then turned and went back
Washington tower then advised that the object was about east of Andrews. I saw it.
It appeared to be moving very slowly, if at all. My attention was turned to
some thing else and when I looked for this object again, it was gone. The only thing
that I saw then was a bright star. I saw this later on and had the impression that the strange
object is close to the observed position but is soon disappeared to the south. Washington tower requested an aircraft be sent to check it. Homan 23, a B-29 that was in the area
flew to the south but didn't see anything. Washington radar advised that they were unable
to pick it up on radar.
Base Operations later advised me that this object could have been Venus. Weather
advised that on a cold clear night Venus stands out very distinctly and at times
creates strange illusions.
Could be, but what I saw passed under Venus, headed south.

The above statements are certified true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
