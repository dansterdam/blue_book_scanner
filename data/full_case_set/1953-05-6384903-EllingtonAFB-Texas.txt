The Wilberli Canter r AFER 3-43

This material is to be regarded As restricted, not to be communicated to any party except Government agencies or individual entitled thereto.

On the evening of the 15th of May 1953, the airman were at their regular Air Police operations at Ellington Air Force Base, Texas, as a result of routine night duties. Around 9:40 P.M. CST, the airman observed a most unusual and brilliant object moving across the sky. The object was first sighted at an angle of approximately 20 to 25 degrees from the horizon traveling in a north-northeast direction at a uniform rate of speed and altitude. The object appeared to be about twice the apparent size of a star or planet and seemed to fluctuate or pulsate rather than emit a steady light. The object faded from view in approximately 30 to 45 seconds as it moved across the sky. The airman immediately reported their observation to the Operations Officer who in turn notified higher headquarters. An investigation was immediately initiated and the airman who observed the object were interrogated.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

RESTRICTED UNCLASSIFIED

Randall C. Smith and five witnesses
Meteorite or strange and unusual natural phenomena?
10 May 1953
1. Lt. C. Smith was 29 minutes airborne in a C-45 aircraft and observed a strange light, which he first thought to be a meteorite, but which upon closer observation proved to be a "stationary self-luminous object" of various colors.

2. This object passed in the near vicinity of the aircraft and was observed to be a definite structured object rather than a natural phenomena. It was observed to have a distinct spherical shape. The object was observed for approximately 30 minutes.

3. Captain Smith considered this object to be a flying disc or unusual aircraft. The object did not show any normal aircraft characteristics such as wings, tail surfaces, or exhaust.

4. Due to the nature of this observation and the credibility of the observer, it is felt that this report warrants further investigation. It is recommended that this report be given a degree of significance.
