The text in the document is as follows:

Originally, the problem involved the preparation and analysis of about 1,300 reports accumulated by the Air Force between 1947 and the end of March, 1952. During this course of the work, the number of reports submitted for analysis and evaluation more than tripled; the result of the unprecedented increase in observations during 1952. Accordingly, this study has been expanded, though for a preliminary analysis, to cover a gross of approximately 4,000 reports.

This study was undertaken primarily to categorize the available reports of sightings and to determine the probability that any of the reports of unidentified aerial objects represented observations of "flying saucers". With full cognizance of the quality of the data available for study, yet with an awareness of the proportions this subject has assumed at times in the public mind, the work was undertaken with the seriousness accorded to a straightforward scientific investigation. In order to establish the probability that many of the reports of unidentified aerial objects represented observations of "flying saucers", it was necessary to make an attempt to answer the question "What is a 'flying saucer'?". However, it must be emphasized that this was only incidental to the primary purpose of the study, the determination of the probability that any of the reports of unidentified aerial objects represented observations of "flying saucers", as defined on Page 1.

The basic technique for this study consisted of reducing the available data to a form suitable for mechanical manipulation, a prerequisite for the application of preliminary statistical methods. One of international Business Machines Corporation's systems was chosen as the best available mechanical equipment.

The reduction of data contained in sighting reports into a form suitable for transfer to IBM punched cards was extremely difficult and time consuming.

For this study a panel of consultants was formed, consisting of both experts within and outside ATIC. During the course of the work, guidance and advice were received from the panel. The professional experience available from the panel covered major scientific fields and numerous.

All records and working papers of this study have been carefully preserved in an orderly fashion suitable for ready reference. These.

The text on the page describes various cases related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text is divided into numbered sections, such as Case III, Case IV, Case V, Case VI, Case VII, Case VIII, Case IX, Case X, and Case XI. Each case discusses the characteristics and features of the reported UFO sightings. The text discusses the various conditions that the UFO cases do or do not satisfy, and provides details about the observed objects, such as their shape, presence of protrusions, rocket or jet pods, fins or rudders, and series of portholes or windows.

(12) Case XII. The object had windows in its top and front and its top midsection. It also had a set of propellers around its waist.

It is not possible, therefore, to derive a verified model of a "flying saucer" from the data that have gathered to date. This point is important enough to emphasize. Out of about 4,000 people who said they saw a "flying saucer", sufficiently detailed descriptions were given in only 12 cases. Having culled the cream of the crop, it is still impossible to develop a picture of what a "flying saucer" is.

In addition to this study of the good UNKNOWNS, an attempt was made to find groups of UNKNOWNS for which the observed characteristics were the same. On the basis of this evidence, therefore, there is a low probability that any of the UNKNOWNS represented observations of a class of "flying saucers". It may be that some reports represent observations of not one but several classes of objects that might have been "flying saucers"; however, the lack of evidence to confirm even one class would seem to make this possibility remote. It is pointed out that some of the cases of UNKNOWNS, before identification, appeared fully as bizarre as any of the 12 cases of good UNKNOWNS, and in fact, would have placed in the class of good UNKNOWNS had it not been possible to establish their identity.

This is, of course, contrary to the bulk of the publicity that has been given this problem. The reason for this nature of this publicity was clearly brought out during the re-evaluation study. It is a definite fact that upon reading a few reports, the reader becomes convinced that "flying saucers" are real and are some form of sinister contrivance. This reaction is independent of the training of the reader. So keen was this attitude toward the "flying saucers" that some of the articles, books, and news stories dealing with the phenomenon of the "flying saucers" were written by men who were in this category, that is, men who had read only a few selected reports. This is accounted for by the fact that, as a rule, only the more lurid sounding reports are cited in these publications. Were it not for this common psychological tendency to be captivated by the mysterious, it is possible that no problem of this nature would exist.

The reaction, mentioned above, that after reading a few reports, the reader is convinced that "flying saucers" are real and are some form of sinister contrivance, is very misleading. As more and more of the reports are read, and is replaced by a feeling of skepticism regarding their existence. The reader eventually reaches a point of saturation, after which the reports contain no new information, and is replaced by a feeling of skepticism regarding their existence. This attitude is replaced by a feeling of skepticism regarding their existence.

CONCLUSIONS
It can never be absolutely proven that "flying saucers" do not exist. This would be true if the data obtained were to include complete scientific measurements of the attributes of each sighting, as well as complete and detailed descriptions of the objects sighted. It might be possible to demonstrate the existence of "flying saucers" with data of this type, IF they were to exist.
Although the reports considered in this study usually did not contain scientific measurements of the attributes of each sighting, it was possible to establish certain valid conclusions by the application of statistical methods to the information of the data. Scientifically evaluated and arranged, the data as a whole did not show any marked patterns or trends. The inaccuracies encountered in this type of data, in addition to the incomplete nature of the information, led to the conclusion that other relationships that otherwise would have been evident. This absence of indicative relationships necessitated an exhaustive study of selective facets of the data in order to draw any valid conclusions.
A critical examination of the distributions of the important characteristics of sightings, plus an intensive study of the particulars of the sightings evaluated as UNKNOWN, led to the conclusion that a combination of factors, principally the reported maneuvers of the objects and the unavailability of supplemental data such as aircraft flight plans or balloon-launching records, resulted in the failure to identify as KNOWNS most of the reports of objects classified as UNKNOWNS.
An intensive study, aimed at finding a verified example of a "flying saucer" or at deriving a verified model type or models of "flying saucers" (as defined on Page 1); led to the conclusion that neither goal could be attained using the present data.
It is emphasized that there was a complete lack of any valid evidence consisting of physical matter in any case of a reported unidentified aerial object.
Thus, the probability that any of the UNKNOWNS considered in this study are "flying saucers" is considered to be extremely small, since the data as a whole failed to reveal even a rough model, and since the data as a whole failed to reveal any marked patterns or trends.
Therefore, on the basis of this evaluation of the information, it is considered to be highly improbable that any of the reports of unidentified aerial objects examined in this study represent observations of technological developments outside the range of present-day scientific knowledge.

ORIGIN AND NATURE OF DATA

Reports of sightings were received by the U.S. Air Force from a representative cross section of the population of the U.S., and varied widely in completeness and quality. Included were reports from reputable scientists, housewives, farmers, students, and technicians trained in observation, as well as from a few reporters and persons stating that a "flying saucer" had been sighted, to those containing thousand of words, including description, speculation, and advice on how to handle the "problem of the flying saucers". Some reports were of high quality, complete, and as complete as the observer could make them; a few originated from people confined to mental institutions. A critical examination of the reports revealed, however, that a high percentage of them was submitted by serious people, mystified by what they had seen and motivated by patriotic responsibility.

Three principal sources of reports were noted in the preliminary review of the data. The bulk of the data arrived at ATIC through regular military channels, from 1947 until the middle of 1952.

A second type of data consisted of letters reporting sightings sent by civilian observers directly to ATIC. Most of these direct communications were dated subsequent to April 30, 1952, and are believed to be the result of a suggestion by a popular magazine that future reports be directed to the Air Technical Intelligence Center. As could be expected, a large number of letters was received following this publicity.

A third type of data was that contained in questionnaire forms completed by the observer himself. A questionnaire form, developed during the course of this study, was mailed to a selected group of writers of direct letters with the request that the form be completed and returned.

In general, the data were subjective, consisting of qualified estimates of physical characteristics rather than of precise measurements. Furthermore, most of the reports were not reduced to written form immediately. The time between sighting and report varied from one day to several years. Both of these factors introduced an element of doubt concerning the validity of the original data, and increased its subjectivity. This was intensified by the recognized inability of the average individual to estimate speeds, distances, and sizes of objects in the air with any degree of accuracy. In spite of these limitations, methods of statistical analysis of such reports in sufficiently large groups are valid. The danger lies in the possibility of drawing conclusions from individual reports.

forgetting the subjectivity of the data at the time that conclusions are drawn from their analysis. It must be emphasized, again and again, that any conclusions contained in this report are based NOT on facts, but on what many observers thought and estimated the true facts to be.

Altogether, the data for this study consisted of approximately 4,000 reports of sightings of unidentified aerial objects. The majority were re-ceived through military channels and from the form of observer-completed questionnaires submitted by reasonably authoritative and questionably reliable sources. Sightings made between June, 1947, and December, 1952, were considered for this study. Sightings alleged to have occurred prior to 1947 were not considered, since they were not reported to official sources until after public interest in "flying saucers" had been stimulated by the popular press.

REDUCTION OF DATA TO MECHANIZED COMPUTATION FORM

As received by the Air Technical Intelligence Center, the sighting reports were not in a form suitable for even a quasi-scientific study. A preliminary review of the data indicated the need for standardized interrogation procedures and supplemental forms for the reduction of currently available data to a form amenable to scientific appraisal.

The plan for reduction of the data to usable form consisted of a program of development comprising four major steps: (1) a systematic listing of the factors necessary to evaluate the observer and his report, and to identify the unknown object observed; (2) a standard scheme for the transfer of data to a mechanized computation system; (3) an orderly means of relating the original data to all subsequent forms; and (4) a consistent procedure for the identification of the phenomenon described by the original data.

Questionnaire

The first reports received by ATIC varied widely in completeness and quality. Air Force Letter 200-5 dated 29 April 1952, were attempts to fix responsibility for and improve the quality of the reports of sightings. To coordinate past efforts to provide standardization for the

(1) A modified Air Force Form 112 lists pertinent questions to be answered in regard to an unidentified-object sighting.
(2) Air Force Letter 200-5 places responsibility with the Air Force for the investigation, reporting, and analysis of unidentified aerial objects. This letter is dated 29 April 1952.

future, it was imperative to develop a questionnaire form listing the factors necessary for evaluation of the observer and his report, and identification of the unknown objects. In addition, it was indicated that such a questionnaire be designed to guide the observer himself to complete when personal interrogation was not possible or practicable.

Ideally, a questionnaire for the purposes required should contain questions pertaining to all technical details considered to be essential for the statistical approach, and should serve to obtain a maximum of information from the average individual who had made a sighting in the past or would be likely to report sightings in the future. Besides these discrete facts, an integrated written description of a sighting would be required. Also, a narrative description might allow subtle questions to be answered concerning the observer's ability, suggestibility, and general mental attitude. As a whole, this information contained in a questionnaire should make possible the classification and evaluation of the sighting, the rating of the observer, the probability of accuracy of reported facts, and the identification of what was reported by the observer as authenticated.

During the course of this project, three questionnaire forms were developed, each intended to be an improved revision of the one preceding. The improvements were suggested and confirmed by members of the panel of consultants connected with this project.

The original form was evolved by the panel of consultants as their first work on this project. It was intended to allow the start of the reduction of reports to discrete data, and was immediately subjected to extensive review and revision by the panel. The revised (second) form was subjected to a trial test before adoption. A TIC sent a copy to observers reporting sightings, with the request that the form be completed and returned. Of the first 300 questionnaires returned during July and August, 1952, 108 were analyzed by a consulting psychologist. On the basis of this analysis, plus the experience gained in working with past reports, the final form of the Questionnaire - the U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet - was evolved. Copies of the three forms of the questionnaire, in the order of their development, are shown as Exhibits B1, B2, and B3 in Appendix B.

In order to implement the transcription of data from past sighting reports, each succeeding form was put to use as soon as it was developed and approved. Accordingly, experience was obtained with each form in relation to past data, an important factor in the improvement of the quality and completeness of the later reports included in this study.

This is the title of the table, which seems to be an evaluation or summary of some cases, organized by station and month.

The table contains rows for various station names, with columns for different months and years. The data appears to be numerical, likely representing some kind of metrics or statistics related to the cases.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old report document, likely related to Project Blue Book, discussing a coding system and work sheet.

The text in the document is as follows:

Coding System and Work Sheet

The reduction of non-numerical data to numerical form is mandatory in the machine handling of data. Since it was impracticable to transfer detailed data of an exact nature from the questionnaire to the IBM punched-card plan, Since it was impracticable to transfer detailed data of an exact nature from the questionnaire to the IBM punched-card plan. The master coding plan was evolved during the early stages of the preliminary analysis of data, and was reviewed by the panel of consultants before use. It was recognized that this system of coding would be the heart of the analysis, that is, the completeness of the facility for translation of data could make or break the study. Accordingly, every conceivable factor that might influence the identification of unidentified aerial objects was included, together with a wide range of variations within each factor. The original coding system (with minor corrections) was used throughout the translation of the original data with marked success. A copy of this system, called CODES, is enclosed as Exhibit B4, Appendix B.

To facilitate the preparation of the punched-card abstract, an intermediate form called the WORK SHEET (later, the CARD BIBLE) was developed. Referenced to both the data from the questionnaire and the system of report identification, the WORK SHEET permitted an orderly transcription of data simultaneously by several people. In conjunction with the CODES, the WORK SHEET was used during the reduction of the original data to code form necessary for transfer to punched cards. A sample is included as Exhibit B5, Appendix B.

After the analysis was under way, it became apparent that the mechanics of machine processing could be improved by incorporating in the IBM card system certain factors requiring more than one column for discrete expression. In addition, the inclusion of certain data relating to the evaluation bearing of the sun with respect to the observer was considered necessary. Finally, a critical examination of certain segments of the master data list for the definition of a limitation of data was accomplished. 

All these additions have been incorporated in a revised set of CODES and CARD BIBLE that are illustrated as Exhibits B6 and B7, Appendix B. However, at the time that the maneuver factor was determined to be critical, it was physically impracticable to make the required definitions and re-evaluate the original data. Therefore, no code for maneuverability has been included in the CODES, CARD BIBLE, or IBM cards.

Identification of Working Papers

The actual reduction of data to IBM punched-card form presented a problem of mass transfer of figures by several workers. Recognizing that an orderly system of relating the original data to the questionnaires, the WORK SHEET, and the IBM card was imperative, a scheme of SERIAL NUMBERS was developed to answer need.

The first data consisted of a series of letter-file folders identified by the year and location of the sighting or sightings they contained. The number of reports of sightings in a single folder varied from 1 to over 20. Under these conditions, there was a great possibility for incorrect transcription of data, duplication of information, or misplacement of interchanges of the same object or objects to one another. The concept of a four-digit serial number (major) followed by a two-digit serial number (minor) was adequate to fulfill these requirements.

To expedite handling of the data, temporary serial numbers were assigned until each report had been evaluated and the phenomenon had been placed in a category of identification. The use of temporary serial numbers permitted the consolidation of duplicate reports from apparently diverse sources, such as a teletype message and an Air Force Form 112. However, this consolidation was made ONLY when it could be proved conclusively that the sources of the two documents were one and the same. Factors of the observer's location, date and time of observation, description of the phenomenon, and finally, the name of the observer were considered. In this manner, the assignment of major serial and minor sub-jects to the reports accepted for the statistical study. It is believed that the reports accepted represent unique and undupl icated instances of sightings.

In the establishment of the serial-number system, it was necessary to define certain terms, so that a standard interpretation could be achieved. The terms and corresponding definitions were:

OBSERVER - Any witness reporting to a proper authority that he had seen unidentified aerial objects.

SIGHTING - The report or group of reports of the same observed phenomenon that remained unidentified to the observer or observers, at least until reported.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. The text appears to be providing definitions and explanations of different types of UFO sightings, such as "SINGLE OBSERVATION" and "MULTIPLE OBSERVATION", as well as details on how sightings were categorized and numbered for statistical analysis.

SINGLE OBSERVATION - A SIGHTING consisting of a single report from (1) one OBSERVER with no knowledge of additional OBSERVERS of the same phenomenon, or (2) a group of witnesses of the same phenomenon, each unaware of the other. The report made the report is called a SINGLE OBSERVER.

MULTIPLE OBSERVATION - A SIGHTING consisting of several reports from OBSERVERS of the same phenomenon who were cognizant of each other. The witnesses who made reports are called MULTIPLE OBSERVERS.

ALL SIGHTINGS - (1) The group of reports consisting of one report for each OBSERVER, including both SINGLE and MULTIPLE OBSERVERS. (2) The questionnaires, work sheets, and IBM card representing the report from each OBSERVER - in other words, the representation of each report in other words, the representation of each report in an other words, the representation of each report in other words, the representation of each report in other words, the representation of each report in

UNIT SIGHTINGS - (1) The group of reports consisting of one report for each SIGHTING, including all the reports of SINGLE OBSERVATIONS and the one most representative report from each MULTIPLE OBSERVATION. (2) The questionnaire, work sheet, and IBM card representing the report for each SIGHTING accepted for the statistical study.

A major serial number (four digits) was assigned to each sighting, segregating the year of occurrence by selection of limits for each year, as followed: 
0001 to 0500 reserved for 1947
0501 to 1000 reserved for 1948
1001 to 1500 reserved for 1949
1501 to 2000 reserved for 1950
2001 to 2500 reserved for 1951
2501 to 4900 reserved for 1952

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

MULTIPLE OBSERVATION was identified with the .00 subscrial number. 
As an example, a MULTIPLE OBSERVATION consisting of six sighting 
reports would have the following serial numbers:

1132.00 representing the best report and observer
1132.01 representing an additional observer
1132.02 representing an additional observer
1132.03 representing an additional observer
1132.04 representing an additional observer
1132.05 representing an additional observer

During the course of the transcription of the data to machine card 
form, it became obvious that certain reports could have been independent
observations of the same phenomenon. So, if the presentation of an
analysis based on one report for each sighting was valid (the concept of 
UNIT SIGHTINGS), a presentation of an analysis based on one report for
each phenomenon should be valid also. Further, the examination of data
relating to the actual number of phenomenons was considered to be the proper
basis for assessing the probability of technological developments outside
the range of present scientific knowledge. Therefore, a designation of 
OBJECT SIGHTINGS was established, with the following definition:

OBJECT SIGHTINGS (1) The group of reports consisting of
one report for each phenomenon. (2) The
questionnaire, work sheet, and IBM card
representing a report for each phenomenon
accepted for the statistical study.

In brief review, ALL SIGHTINGS refer to all reports, UNIT SIGHTINGS
refer to actual sightings, and OBJECT SIGHTINGS refer to the assumed
number of phenomena.

It must be recognized that the process of identifying OBJECT
SIGHTINGS was deductive, while that for UNIT SIGHTINGS was definitive. 
A conservative approach was adopted in the determination of OBJECT
SIGHTINGS, recognizing the possibility of multiple OBJECT SIGHTINGS from
a single sighting, due to the variation of observations, and range, bearing and elevation of the phenomenon. Any error of selection of OBJECT
SIGHTINGS will tend to be in the direction of reducing the actual number of
phenomena observed (several instances of UNIT SIGHTINGS that might be
one OBJECT SIGHTING were noted, but the evidence was not conclusive
enough to justify consolidation of the reports).

Following the determination of OBJECT SIGHTINGS, a series of
serial numbers, called the INCIDENT SERIAL NUMBERS, was established
to facilitate any future SIGHTINGS of a specific object sighting. Each reported
sighting that relates to an OBJECT SIGHTING received the same incident serial number, a four-digit code paralleling the major serial number series.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force project to investigate UFO sightings.

The text in the document is as follows:

For machine manipulation, it was desirable to be able to select the sample of cards (all reports, sightings, and phenomena) to be included in a particular study. The concept of a SIGN IDENTIFICATION CARD was developed. This card, and the correlated working papers, the code for this function was developed. Multiple punching eliminated the need to use several columns for discrete expression of the variations. Selection of the proper number in this column thus permitted selections of the desired sample of cards.

Evaluation of Individual Reports

Evaluation of sighting reports was recognized as a crucial step in the preparation of data for statistical treatment, inconsistent evaluations would have invalidated any conclusions to be derived from this study. A method of evaluation was, therefore, determined simultaneously with the development of the questionnaire, and the work sheet. It is apparent that for the purpose of statistical treatment, a precise analysis of the original data for statistical treatment, were instructed only to select the statistical, specially qualified scientists and engineers.

Evaluation consisted of a standardized procedure to be followed for: (1) the deduction of discrete facts from data which depended on human impressions rather than scientific measurements, (2) the rating of the observer and his report as determined from available information, and (3) the determination of the probable identification of the phenomena observed.

Categories of identification, established upon the basis of previous experience, were as follows:
Balloon
Astronomical
Aircraft
Light phenomenon
Bird
Cloud
Insufficient information
Psychological manifestations
Unknown 
Other

The first step in evaluation, the deduction of discrete facts from subjective data, required certain calculations based on the information available in the sighting report. An example was the finding of the approximate angular velocity and acceleration of the object or objects sighted. Care was taken during this phase of the work to insure against the deduction of discrete facts not warranted by the original data. Thus, even though there was a complete lack of any valid evidence consisting of

Physical matter in any case of a reported unidentified aerial object, this was not assumed to be prima facie evidence that "flying saucers" did not exist.

In those cases in which an attempt to reduce the information to a factual level failed completely, the report was eliminated from further consideration, and thus not included in the statistical analysis. About 800 of these reports were rejected because they were extremely nebulous; the rest were rejected because they contained highly conflicting statements.

The second step in evaluation, the rating of the observer and his report, logically followed the first step, the reduction of the data to usable form. Ratings were assigned on the basis of the following factors of information, considered in relation to one another:

(1) The experience of the observer, deduced from his occupations, age, and training;
(2) The consistency among the separate portions of the description of the sighting;
(3) The general quality and completeness of the report;
(4) Consideration of the observer's fact-reporting ability and attitude, as disclosed by his manner of describing the sighting.

In cases in which insufficient information was available to make a judgment of the observer or report, none was made, but the report was accepted for the statistical study.

The third step in the process of evaluation, the attempted identification of the objects sighted, was first by the individual who made the transcription of the data (the preliminary identification), and later (the final identification) by conference of four persons, two representatives from ATIC and two from the panel of consultants. Although it must be emphasized that any previous identification of a sighting made by ATIC was not introduced or referred to in any way.

In the coding system, the choices provided for final identifications were based on ATIC's previous experience in analysis of the data. They had found that the majority of sightings could be classified as misinterpretations of common objects or natural phenomena. Accordingly, categories for objects most frequently present in the air were provided. Balloons, aircraft, astronomical bodies (such as meteors), birds, and clouds or dust were recognized as major categories. The less frequent, but common objects, such as kites, fireworks, flares, rockets, contrails, and

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that contains text describing various categories used to classify UFO sightings, such as "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION", "PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS", and "UNKNOWN". The text provides detailed explanations for each classification category.

METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA LIKE SMALL TORNADOES, WERE COLLECTED INTO A CATEGORY CALLED OTHER. A SEPARATE CATEGORY FOR THE UNCOMMON NATURAL PHENOMENA ASSOCIATED WITH LIGHT REFLECTIONS OR REFRACTIONS, SUCH AS MIRAGES, SUN DOGS, INVERSION-LAYER IMAGES, AND DISTORTIONS CAUSED BY AIRBORNE ICE, WAS ESTABLISHED WITH THE TITLE OF LIGHT PHENOMENON. CATEGORIES FOR INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION, PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS, AND UNKNOWN WERE PROVIDED FOR THE SIGHTINGS THAT COULD NOT BE FITTED INTO THE PRECEDING IDENTIFICATIONS. AN EXPLANATION OF THEIR USE FOLLOWS:

INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION - THIS IDENTIFICATION CATEGORY WAS ASSIGNED TO A REPORT WHEN, UPON FINAL CONSIDERATION, THERE WAS SOME ESSENTIAL ITEM OF INFORMATION MISSING, OR THERE WAS ENOUGH DOUBT ABOUT WHAT DATA WERE AVAILABLE TO DISALLOW MAKING A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION. IT IS EMPHASIZED THAT THIS CATEGORY OF IDENTIFICATION WAS NOT USED AS A CONVENIENT WAY TO DISPOSE OF WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED "POOR UNKNOWNS", BUT AS A CATEGORY FOR REPORTS THAT, PERHAPS, COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL KNOWN ASPECTS OF NATURAL PHENOMENA. NO REPORTS IDENTIFIED AS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION CONTAIN AUTHENTICATED FACTS OR IMPRESSIONS CONCERNING THE SIGHTING THAT WOULD PREVENT ITS BEING IDENTIFIED AS A KNOWN OBJECT OR PHENOMENON.

PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS - THIS IDENTIFICATION CATEGORY WAS ASSIGNED TO A REPORT WHEN, ALTHOUGH IT WAS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT THE OBSERVER HAD SEEN SOMETHING, IT WAS ALSO OBVIOUS THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SIGHTING HAD BEEN OVERDRAWN. RELIGIOUS FANATICISM, A DESIRE FOR PUBLICITY, OR AN OVER-ACTIVE IMAGINATION WERE THE MOST COMMON MENTAL ABERRATIONS CAUSING THIS TYPE OF REPORT.

UNKNOWN - THIS DESIGNATION IN THE IDENTIFICATION CODE WAS ASSIGNED TO THOSE REPORTS OF SIGHTINGS WHEREIN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT AND ITS MANEUVERS COULD NOT BE FITTED TO THE PATTERN OF ANY KNOWN OBJECT OR PHENOMENON.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, which was a US Air Force program to investigate UFO sightings.

The text on the page discusses the procedures and criteria used in the identification and evaluation of UFO sightings. It mentions that the "Certain" identification indicated a minimum amount of doubt regarding the validity of the evaluation, and that a "Doubtful" identification indicated that the choice was less positive, but that there was a better than even chance of being correct.

The text also discusses the importance of collaboration and consistency among the panel of consultants in making the identifications, as well as the procedures followed in making the final identifications, which involved statistical treatment and a conference of four qualified persons.

The text also mentions that during the identification conferences, each sighting report was first studied by one person, and if the two identifications were the same, the report was appropriately marked and considered finished. If the two identifications did not agree, the report was considered later by everyone participating in the conference until a group decision could be made.

SIGHTING DATA: OCR completed 2342 

EXPLANATION AND COMMENTS: No photographic or other physical evidence (other than the observer's verbal report) has been submitted in conjunction with this sighting. Little is known about the actual physical characteristics of the object except that it was described as a bright, elongated object with a red tail. The initial report made no mention of size, altitude, or speed. It is possible that the object was a meteor or other astronomical phenomenon, but without more specific descriptive data, its identity cannot be definitely established.

There is no photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book document. The text is focused on an analysis of the data, including a description of the sorting and tabulation program used to analyze the sightings of unidentified aerial objects. It discusses the development of a plan for sorting, counting, and tabulating the information, as well as the anticipation of finding patterns or trends that could provide insight into the characteristics of "flying saucers". However, there is no visual image or photograph included on this particular page.

Upon completion of final identifications, all data were transferred to IBM cards, preparatory to analysis.

ANALYSIS OF THE DATA 

Broadly stated, the problem at this point consisted of the judicious application of scientific methods of categorizing and analyzing the subjective data in reports of sightings of unidentified aerial objects. It was recognized that an approach to this analysis could best be made by a systematic sorting and tabulation program to give frequency and percentage distributions of the important characteristics of sightings. A suggestion was referred that analy tical study of the data might yield information relative to the future about a sighting or a group of sightings, and to provide answers, when required. The systematic approach made it possible to develop a detailed reference manual of the attributes of the sightings included in this study.

Thus, at the beginning of the analysis, a detailed plan was developed for sorting, counting, and tabulating the information from the punched-card abstracts of reports of sightings. It was believed at the time, and later substantiated, that the results of the program for sorting and tabulating would serve as a guide for the more sophisticated treatment involving statistical methods.

Also, it was anticipated that any patterns or trends that might be found could be subjected to concentrated study in the hope of discovering significant information relating to the characteristics of "flying saucers". Further, it was believed that these trends could serve as certain of the criteria of validity for any concepts (models) developed in the attempt to discover a class of "flying saucers".

The three parts of this study (1) the sorting and tabulation program, (2) the advanced study of the results of that program, and (3) the investigation of the possibility of conceiving a model of a "flying saucer" from descriptions reported, are discussed in sections entitled "Frequency and Percentage Distributions by Characteristics", "Advanced Study of the Data", and "The 'Flying Saucer' Model".

Frequency and Percentage Distributions by Characteristics

The original conception of this study assumed the availability of sufficient data to describe adequately the physical appearance, maneuver characteristics, range, direction, and probable path of the object or objects observed. However, familiarity with the data, acquired during the

translation and transcription from reports to punched cards, indicated that there could be no really meaningful correlation studies. Either the original data or reports would seriously reduce the sample of a specific variable.

Preliminary tabulations of various sortings substantiated the impossibility of deriving statistical results from certain variables, such as movement of the observer during the sighting, sound, shape parameter, size, angular velocity and acceleration, appearance and disappearance, bearing, initial and final elevation, altitude, and orientation of the object. The statistically usable variables presented in this study include the date, time, location, duration, reliability, and method of observation of the sighting, and the physical attributes of luminosity, color, speed, shape, light brightness, and identification of the objects sighted.

The presentation of frequency and percentage distributions of any of the variables must be interpreted in the light of the sample of incidents represented, as the objects sighted, based on ALL SIGHTINGS, could lead to misrepresentation and distortion of the results, because of the multiplicity of reports on some of the phenomena. On the other hand, the percentage distributions reported by each observer is more likely to be correct than a distribution based on one report for each phenomenon. To assure that the results nearly correct presentation was made, and to avoid the possibility of failure to uncover any pattern or trend inherent in the data, the variables were studied on five different bases or samples. These samples, and their numerical relation to each other, were as follows:

ALL SIGHTINGS (all reports)                        - 3,201 cards
UNIT SIGHTINGS, all observers                  - 2,554 cards
UNIT SIGHTINGS, single observer                - 2,232 cards
UNIT SIGHTINGS, multiple observers            - 322 cards
OBJECT SIGHTINGS                                  - 2,199 cards

The preliminary tabulations indicated that the samples based on UNIT SIGHTINGS, single observers, and UNIT SIGHTINGS, multiple observers, would not add materially to this study. Accordingly, although the frequency distributions were recognized and are available for study, they are not presented in this report.

The bases of ALL SIGHTINGS, UNIT SIGHTINGS (referring to all observers), and OBJECT SIGHTINGS are presented in Appendix A as Tables A1 through A240. A critical study of these tabulations reveals that there is no apparent change in the distribution of any variable from one basis to another, and that no marked patterns or trends exist in any sample.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing the graphical presentation of data and the analysis of information related to UFO sightings.

Graphical Presentation
The graphical representation of the important information contained in the tables is presented in Figures 1 through 38. These figures present the distributions of the important variables only by the total number of cases in each identification category; since no significant differences were found between the distributions of "Certain" and "Doubtful" identifications of objects with respect to the tabulated variables, a photological study of these figures will afford a broad picture of the tabulated information, without the necessity of a detailed study of the tables.

A critical examination of the figures will show that no trends, patterns, or correlations are to be found, with the exception of Figures 8 through 30. The apparent similarity of the distributions shown by these minor graphs, however, is due to the similarity of the basic underlying distribution and does not indicate any significant relationship between the variables. A statistical study of the distributions shows that there was a low probability that the distributions of the KNOWNS and UNKNOWNS by these characteristics were the same. These tests and their interpretation are discussed in the following section. For purposes of this study, the strategic areas, shown in Figures 32 through 38, and Tables A223 through A240, Appendix A, were designated on the basis of concentration of reports of OBJECT SIGHTINGS in an area. No other interpretation of the tables or remaining charts was deemed necessary.

Advanced Study of the Data
It was recognized that the lack of any patterns or trends, as shown by the tabulations and graphs, provided an insecure basis for drawing definite conclusions. Accordingly, shortly before the sorting and tabulation program was concluded, a program of study of the data was developed to utilize statistical and other mathematical methods, which could lead to a more concrete interpretation of the problem.

Position of the Sun Relative to the Observer
The first thing that was done was to calculate the angle of elevation of the sun above the horizon and its bearing from true north as seen by the observer at the time of each sighting. With this information, it could then be determined whether there was a possibility that the reported object could have been illuminated by light from the sun. In addition, it could be determined whether an object could be a mock sun (sun dog) or whether there was a possibility of specular reflection of an aircraft at the position of the object, which would give the appearance of a "flying disc".

A program of computation was set up and carried out to obtain the angle of elevation and the bearing of the sun for each sighting. All information needed for this calculation was available on the deck of IBM cards.

EXAMINATION                            DESCRIPTION                        CONCLUSION         REPORT NO. 
DESCRIPTION -                 - An unidentified object, described as being circular in shape, about 25 to 30 feet in diameter, and travelling at a high rate of speed, approximately 900 mph, was observed by witnesses on May 11, 1955.

The object was observed at an altitude of about 10,000 feet, and was sighted for a period of about 30 seconds before disappearing from view. There was no sound associated with the object.

The witnesses were members of the Armed Forces, and the observation occurred at an Air Force installation.

CONCLUSION - The object observed could not be identified as any known type of aircraft, and remains unidentified.

RECOMMENDATION - None.

Transcribed text from the document:

This information consisted of:
(1) Time and date of observation in Greenwich Civil Time
(2) Latitude and longitude of the observer at the time of observation.

Figure 39 shows a celestial sphere on which Z represents the observer's zenith, B represents the sun, and Zs represents the north celestial pole.

Using the date and time of the observation, the longitude and declination (S) of the sun were obtained from an ephemeris of the sun and corrected for the equation of time. The difference between the longitudes of the sun and the observer was taken, and called the hour angle (HA on Figure 39).

Then, using the declination of the sun (S), the latitude of the observer (lat), and the sun's angle (ZS) between the observer's zenith and the sun can be calculated from the law of cosines of spherical trigonometry. Thus, cos ZS = cos (90 - lat) cos (90 - S) + sin (90 - lat) sin (90 - S) cos (90 - HA).

Since the angle ZS is measured from the observer's zenith, the angle of elevation of the sun above the horizon for daytime sightings was found by taking 90 - ZS. When the angle of depression of the sun below the horizon was found by taking ZS - 90.

Having found the angle ZS, the bearing of the sun (angle B) was obtained from the formula: sin (B) / sin (HA) = sin (90 - S) / sin (ZS)

All of the above calculations were made with IBM equipment. Sinces, cosines, and their inverses were obtained from decks of 9,000 IBM cards on which seven-place Peteri's tables of the sines, cosines, and tangents of angles had been punched for each 0.01 of a degree from 0 to 90 degrees.

Upon completion of these calculations, the cards representing OBJECT SIGHTINGS were sorted on the basis of the sine of the bearing angle. This separated the cards into two groups: (1) sightings which occurred between midnight and the bearing angle was positive; and (2) sightings between midnight and noon, for which the sine of the bearing angle was negative. Then each of these groups was sorted into groups for intervals of 10* in angle of elevation of the sun from -90* to +90*. A count was made of the number of cards in each group, and from this a histogram was constructed (Figure 40). The UNKNOWN OBJECT SIGHTINGS were then sorted out, counted in the same manner, and a histogram was made (again see Figure 40).

The image appears to be a graph showing the frequency of object sightings by angle of elevation of the sun, in intervals of 10 degrees of angle. The graph displays three distinct profiles - "Sun rise", "All object sightings", and "Unknown object sightings". The x-axis represents the angle of elevation of the sun, ranging from -90 to +90 degrees, while the y-axis shows the number of object sightings.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document discussing observations of the sun and related sightings.

The following text is transcribed from the document:

The following points should be carefully noted about these histograms:

(1) The negligible number of sightings when the sun is within 10° of the horizon and radio: (angle of elevation of the sun = ±90°) of the observer is due to the fact that the southern-most latitude of the U. S. is greater than the declination of the sun at the summer solstice, so that it would be impossible for the sun to reach the zenith or nadir of any observer in the U. S. (where most of the sightings were made).

(2) The time of day at which a particular angle of elevation of the sun occurs does not remain fixed but varies from day to day. Consider, for example, the variation in sunrise and sunset times over the course of a year.

Thus, there are only two inferences to be made from this histogram: (1) the high peak of sightings after sunset, and (2) the lack of increase in the UNKNOWNS relative to the KNOWNS near either sunset or sunrise. This would seem to discount the possibility that atmospheric phenomena such as mirages or refractions of light could account for such phenomena usually occur when the sun is near the horizon.

The Local Sun Time was computed as a step in the calculation of the angle of elevation of the sun. It is related to the hour angle by the equation: Local Sun Time (L.S.T.) = HA/15 + 12.00, where L.S.T. is in hours and HA in degrees.

The cards were grouped on the basis of L.S.T. in intervals of one hour, and the number of cards in each interval was counted. Again the UNKNOWNS were sorted out and similar treated. Histograms were constructed with the results of these tabulations of OBJECT SIGHTINGS (Figure 41). Here, again, there is a peak in the early evening hours.

The cards were then broken up into seven groups on the basis of the angle of elevation of the sun, as follows:

Group 1 - Daylight sightings for which the sun was more than 10° above the horizon.
Group 2 - Sunset sightings for which the sun was between 0° and 10° above the horizon. 
Group 3 - Sunset sightings for which the sun was between 0° and 10° below the horizon.
Group 4 - Evening sightings for which the sun was between 10° and 40° below the horizon.

There is no photograph in this image. The image contains a chart titled "FIGURE 41 FREQUENCY OF OBJECT SIGHTINGS BY LOCAL SUN TIME, INTERVALS OF ONE HOUR". The chart shows the frequency of object sightings, both known and unknown, over a 24-hour period in terms of local sun time.

The image does not contain any photographs. However, it does include a table with data on "Object Sightings" which categorizes various sightings into different groups based on the angle of elevation and the type of object observed (balloon, astronomical, aircraft, light phenomena, unidentified information, and other). The table provides numerical counts for each category across the different angle of elevation groups. Additionally, the text provides context around the purpose of the groups and the coding system used in the table.

Group 5 - Night sightings for which the sun was more than 10° below the horizon and which were not included in Group 4.
Group 6 - Sunrise sightings for which the sun was between 0° and 10° below the horizon.
Group 7 - Sunrise sightings for which the sun was between 0° and 10° above the horizon.

These group numbers were punched on the cards and incorporated into the coding system. The number of OBJECT SIGHTINGS in each group for each identification was then tabulated and is given in Table I.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing text describing a statistical test called the Chi Square Test.

UNKNOWNS in each characteristic group showed the same general trend. In other words, on the basis of these graphs, it looked as though there was a good possibility that the UNKNOWNS were no different from the KNOWNS, at least in the aggregate. It was decided to investigate this by the use of a statistical procedure called the "Chi Square Test."

The Chi Square Test is a statistical test of the likelihood that two distributions come from the same population, that is, it gives the probability that there is no difference in the make-up of the two distributions.

The method is outlined as follows:
(1) Adjust the distributions by multiplying the KNOWNS in each characteristic group by the ratio of the total number of UNKNOWNS to the total number of KNOWNS. (The Chi Square Test is applicable only to distributions which have the same total number of elements.)
(2) Take the difference between the number of UNKNOWNS and the adjusted number of KNOWNS in each characteristic group.
(3) Square the remainder from Step 2.
(4) Divide the result of Step 3 by the corresponding number of adjusted KNOWNS.

This is the chi square for the particular group. Summing the individual chi squares over the groups of a characteristic gives the chi square for that characteristic. This number is then compared with a table of the distribution of chi square which can be found in many texts on elementary statistics.

It will be noted that chi square is tabulated in terms of degrees of freedom which in this case is one less than the number of groups of sighting.

The tabulations of KNOWNS and UNKNOWNS against the six characteristics and the Chi Square applied are shown in Tables II through VII. In each case, the number of degrees of freedom is given, as is the value of the chi square corresponding to probabilities of 5 per cent and 1 per cent that two distributions with this number of degrees of freedom could have come from the same population. Since the greater the value of chi square, the smaller the probability that the two distributions are homogeneous, the 5 per cent or 1 per cent values will indicate a probability less than 5 per cent or 1 per cent, respectively, that the two distributions are homogeneous. The term homogeneity is used here to indicate that two distributions could have come from the same population.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a summary of reports of unidentified aerial objects (commonly referred to as "flying saucers" or "flying discs") received by the U.S. Air Force.

The text of the summary is as follows:

SUMMARY

Reports of unidentified aerial objects (popularly termed "flying saucers" or "flying discs"), have been received by the U. S. Air Force since mid-1947 from many and diverse sources. Although there was no evidence that the unexplained reports of unidentified objects constituted a threat to the security of the U. S., the Air Force determined that all reports of unidentified aerial objects should be investigated and evaluated to determine if "flying saucer" represents technological developments not known to this country.

In order to discover any pertinent trends or patterns inherent in the data, and to evaluate any existing or patterns found, appropriate methods of data reduction were employed. Statistical object identification was fortified by special analytical procedures which were employed. In general, the conclusional interpretations of apparently unexplainable events, and seldom contained reliable measurements of physical attributes. This subjectivity of the data presented a major limitation to the drawing of significant conclusions, but did not invalidate the application of scientific methods of study.

The reports received by the U. S. Air Force on unidentified aerial objects were reduced to IBM punched-card abstracts of the data by means of logically developed forms and standardized evaluation procedures. Evaluation of sighting reports, a crucial step in the preparation of the data for statistical treatment, consisted of an appraisal of the reports and the subsequent categorizing of the object or objects described in each report. A detailed categorization of this phase of the study stresses the careful attempt to maintain complete objectivity and consistency.

Only a minor portion of the reports refined and evaluated derived from the original reports of sightings comprised (1) a systematic attempt to ferret out any distinguishing characteristics inherent in the data or any of their segments, (2) a concentrated study of any trends or patterns found, and (3) an attempt to determine the probability that any of the UNKNOWNS represent observations of a class, or classes, of "flying saucers".

The first step in the analysis of the data revealed the existence of certain apparent similarities between cases definitely identified and those not identified. Statistical methods of testing were applied which indicated a low probability that these apparent similarities were significant. An attempt to determine the probability that any of the UNKNOWNS represented observations of a class, or classes, of "flying saucers" necessitated a thorough re-examination and re-evaluation of cases of objects not originally identified; this led to the conclusion that the probability was very small.

Performing OCR on the text:

In five of the six cases, the probability is less than 1 per cent that the distributions are the same. In the sixth case, Light Brightness, the classifications are prohibitive to be real value. However, these tests do not necessarily mean that the UNKNOWNS are primarily "flying saucers" and not aircraft, balloons, or other known objects, as these might still be unidentified KNOWNS if either of the following cases occurred:

(1) The characteristics which were observed for the UNKNOWNS were different from those observed for the KNOWNS because of the psychological make-up of the observer or because of atmospheric distortions. This assumes the distribution of objects in KNOWNS and UNKNOWNS is the same.

(2) The UNKNOWNS may be known objects in different proportions than the group identified as KNOWNS. (That is, a greater percentage of the UNKNOWNS could be aircraft than the percentage of aircraft in the identified KNOWNS.)

The second case is the more probable one. In this connection, it is interesting to note the factors which contributed to a large chi square result in the tests made:

(1) Color
The major contribution to chi square in color is from the color green. There is a large excess of green sightings among the KNOWNS over the UNKNOWNS. Of the 130 known objects in this classification, 98 are astronomical, and are due mostly to the green fireballs reported from the Southwest U.S.

(2) Number
The large chi square is due to a greater proportion of UNKNOWNS in the multiple object classification. Apparently these are harder to identify.

(3) Shape
In this case, there is a higher percentage of UNKNOWNS in the rocket-airship-shape classification. These might be familiar objects for which unusual maneuvers were reported.

There is a higher percentage of KNOWNS in the flame and in the meteor- or comet-shape category, which in both cases appears to result mainly from excesses of astronomical sightings.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing textual information.

(4) Duration of observation
Here there is an excess of KNOWNS in the less-than-5-second group. Again, the majority of KNOWNS in this group are astronomical. The greater proportion of UNKNOWNS in the 6-30 second to 5-minute groups cannot be explained.

(5) Speed
The major contribution to chi square for this characteristic is due to a large excess of UNKNOWNS in the over 400-mph class. It can be assumed that some of the excessive speeds are inaccuracies in estimates by observers. However, some radar sightings, which are precisely impossible to identify, show objects with speeds of 1,000 to 2,000 mph and over, and these reports account for a number of these UNKNOWNS.

(6) Light brightness
Since this chi square was not significant, it is not necessary to discuss it here.
An examination of these discrepancies thus brings up a very interesting point. In every case for which there is a significant excess of KNOWNS over UNKNOWNS, the excess can be attributed to an excess of identifiable astronomical phenomena. This would seem to lead to the conclusion that the astronomical phenomena are easy to identify and there are very few left in the UNKNOWNS. Accordingly, the astronomical object sightings were deleted from the KNOWNS object sightings and the Chi Square Test was again applied. The results are shown in Tables VIII through XIII, where in this case the KNOWNS do not contain astronomical sightings.
It will be noted that some groups were combined when the adjusted number of KNOWNS was so small as to preclude a meaningful comparison. The number of objects per sighting was the characteristic studied. These were combined to obtain a good combination of groups existed.
It is apparent that the deletion of astronomical sightings gives a better fit, although the decision is not clear cut, since for two cases (light brightness and speed), the chi square increased. However, it can again be pointed out that the reporting of these two characteristics is highly subjective and is open to question. The estimation of speed is especially open to question because of the impossibility of accurately determining it visually.

Therefore, on the basis of this evaluation of the information, it is considered to be highly improbable that reports of unidentified aerial objects examined in this study represent observations of technological developments outside of the range of present-day scientific knowledge. It is emphasized that there was a complete lack of any valid evidence constituting of physical matter in any case of a reported unidentified aerial object.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing the results of certain tests related to UFO sightings.

Another interesting aspect of these new tests is that there are only two large categories in all the groups. These are for the 11 or more groups in the classification by number of objects per sighting and for the for over 400-mph and monster-like classifications by speed. The first was relatively unchanged by deletion of the astronomical sightings principally because of the concentration of the sightings in the single-object category. The second was slightly increased by the removal of the astronomical sightings. However, the main discrepancy, that of the excess of UNKNOWNS in the over-400-mph class, was a little changed.

The results of these tests are inconclusive since they neither confirm nor deny that the UNKNOWNS are practically unidentified KNOWNS, although they do indicate that relatively few of the UNKNOWNS are actually astronomical phenomena.

It was decided that this process would not be carried to its logical conclusion (that is, the determination of a linear combination of KNOWNS that would give a negligible chi squared when compared with the UNKNOWNS), since it was felt that the inaccuracies in the reports would give a distorted and meaningless result.

The "Flying Saucer" Model

The importance of the problem dictated a second approach, should the statistical results prove inconclusive. It was decided that an attempt would be made to describe the physical appearance, distribution statistics, and other attributes (that is, construct a model) of a class or classes of "flying saucers".

Preparatory to this attempt, a re-evaluation of the UNKNOWNS was necessary. This re-evaluation was accomplished by a panel composed only of persons previously associated with the work. Using all the UNKNOWN reports available from the careful study of the reports for the UNKNOWN SIGHTINGS in angle-of-sun-elevation Groups 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 - those groups for which the sun was either above the horizon or less than 10° in elevation below the horizon.

This study had two purposes. The first was to determine, with additional information such as the angle of elevation of the sun, how many of the UNKNOWNS might be ascribed to known phenomena. The second was to obtain sufficient detail that they might be used to construct a model or models of "flying saucers".

It was decided to put any of the UNKNOWNS which might be known phenomena into a "possible KNOWN" category to denote the slightly lower confidence level which could be ascribed to these new evaluations. The

Transcription of the text:

UNKNOWNS with sufficiently detailed description would be called "good UNKNOWNS", while the remainder would simply be called UNKNOWNS. One hundred sixty-four folders of a total of 186 OBJECT SIGHTINGS in groups 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 were examined. There were 18 possible aircraft, 20 possible balloons, 7 good UNKNOWNS, 100 UNKNOWNS, and 19 others which were considered as being POSSIBILITIES of various types. It is interesting to note that two of these were established as mock suns on the basis of the angle of sun reflection and the bearing angle, together with the direction of the object from the observer.

In addition, the UNKNOWNS were scanned with no attempt at identification, but to find any possible "good UNKNOWNS". There were five sightings that could be put into this category.

Of the UNKNOWNS, there were approximately 20 sightings that were observed in such a way that they should have been recognized easily if they had been familiar objects, that is, there was little possibility that their shapes, as seen, could have been reported sufficiently by one cause or another to render them unrecognizable. There were a very few that would have been identified as guided missiles or rockets, but that were not so identified because of the geographical location in which they were seen.

All of the remaining UNKNOWNS were classified as such solely because they were reported to have performed maneuvers that could not be ascribed to any known objects. In these cases, the shape might have been unrecognizable also, but it was felt that this was because of distortion and distance, or because of darkness.

This is a very important point. To put it differently, if these UNKNOWNS, which represent all but about 40 of the UNKNOWNS SIGHTINGS, had been observed under conditions whereby they could have been identified as known phenomena, they would probably have been identified as KNOWNS. With the exception of some regular sightings, all of these maneuvers were observed visually. The possibilities for inaccuracies are great because of the liability of an observer to estimate wrongly size, distance, and speed.

Reports of sightings by radar usually were of high-speed objects, some at extremely high altitudes. Some were identified as UNKNOWNS because there was no object to be seen visually at the point indicated by the radar set. It cannot be said with any assurance what these radar sightings mean, but the most logical explanation is that they are ground targets reflected by atmospheric temperature layers. The validity of this statement cannot be established. It is felt that radar sightings in this study are of no significance whatsoever unless a visual sighting of the object also is made.

It is taken in conjunction with the Chi Square Tests discussed earlier, the results of the re-evaluation of reports identified as UNKNOWN SIGHTINGS would seem to indicate that the majority of them could easily be accounted for.

The image contains a technical drawing of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The drawing depicts a "flying saucer" shape with round cups protruding from the surface. The dimensions provided indicate the object is approximately 6 to 8 feet long and 1-1/2 feet wide. There is no photograph present in this document.

Text transcribed from the document:

Thus, out of the 434 OBJECT SIGHTINGS that were identified as UNKNOWNS by the data reduction process, there were only 12 that were described with sufficient detail that they could be used in an attempt to derive a model of a "flying saucer". The following is a summary of the 12 good UNKNOWN SIGHTINGS:

Case I (Serial 0573.00)
Two men employed by a rug-cleaning firm were driving across a bridge at 0955 hours on July 29, 1948, when they saw an object glide across the road a few hundred feet in front of them. It was shiny and metallic in construction, about 6 to 8 feet long and 2 feet wide. It was in a flat glide path at an altitude of about 30 feet and in a moderate turn to the left. It was seen for only a few seconds and apparently went down in a wooded area, although no trace of it was found.

Case II (Serial 4508.00)
A naval aviation student, his wife, and several others were at a drive-in movie from 2115 to 2240 hours on April 20, 1952, during which time they saw several groups of objects fly over. There were from two to nine objects in a group and there were about 20 groups. The groups of objects were described as follows: The objects glowed with a bright white light which appeared to pulsate and the groups came from the south and headed north. The groups were spread out and the objects kept an even spacing between themselves.

The image appears to contain a photograph depicting an unidentified flying object. The photograph shows an oval-shaped object with a fuzzy area and a light glow emanating from it. The text below the image provides a description of the object, stating that it "flew in a straight line except for some changes in direction accomplished in a manner like any standard aircraft turn." The objects are described as being "shaped like conventional aircraft" and having a "glow surrounding it and was glowing itself."

objects flew in a straight line except for some changes in direction accomplished in a manner like any standard aircraft turn.

The objects were shaped like conventional aircraft. The unaccountable feature of the objects was that each had a red glow surrounding it and was glowing itself, although it was a cloudless night.

Case III (Serial 2013.00, 2014.00, and 2014.01)
Two tower operators sighted a light over a city airport at 2020 hours on January 20, 1951. Since a commercial plane was taking off at this time, the pilots were asked to investigate the light. They observed it at 2026 hours. According to them, it flew abreast of them at a greater radius as they climbed. It flashed some lights, which blinked some, which time it blinked some more lights. This caused the two tower operators to attempt to watch the object. However, it turned toward the plane and flew across, instantly appearing on their other side flying in the same direction as they were flying, and then in 2 or 3 seconds it slipped under them, and they did not see it again. Total time of the observation was not stated. In appearance, it was like an airplane with a cigar-shaped body and straight wings, somewhat larger than a B-29. No engine nacelles were observed on the wings.

The image contains a photograph of a cross-shaped object and a drawing of a lighted, saucer-shaped object with an exhaust. The caption below the photograph states that the cross-shaped objects were observed on July 19, 1952, when two cigar-shaped objects were seen moving to the east and came back, at which time both ascended until out of sight. The duration of observation was 3 to 4 minutes, and it was stated that the objects appeared to be transparent and illuminated from the inside.

Case IV (Serial 4599.00)
One hot night on July 19, 1952, when they looked up and saw two cigar-shaped objects. One hovered while the other moved to the east and came back, at which time both ascended until out of sight. Duration of observation was 3 to 4 minutes. Both had an exhaust at one end, and neither had projections of any kind. It was stated that they appeared to be transparent and illuminated from the inside.

The image contains two illustrations depicting an object encountered during a UFO sighting. The object is described as having no visible wings or other protrusions, and having two rows of lighted windows. The illustrations show the shape and features of the object, including a "pilot" and "copilot" section. There is also a "cockpit windshield" visible.

Case V (Serial 0565.00 to 0565.03)
On July 24, 1948, when they saw an object coming toward them. It passed to the right and slightly above them, at which time it went into a climb and was lost from sight in some clouds. Duration of the observation was about 10 seconds. One passenger was able to such a flash of light as the object passed. The object seemed powered by rocket or jet motors shooting a trail of fire some 50 feet to the rear of the object. The object had no wings or other protrusion and had two rows of lighted windows.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

INTRODUCTION

In June, 1947, Kenneth Arnold, a Boise, Idaho, businessman and private pilot, publicly reported the now-famous sighting of a chainlike formation of disc-shaped objects near Mount Rainier, Washington. Resulting in the term "flying saucer" publicity of this incident caused the public interest, and shortly thereafter, a rash of reports of unidentified aerial objects spawned the term "flying saucers". During the years since 1947, many reports of unidentified aerial objects have been received by the Air Force from many sources.

The unfortunate term "flying saucer", or "flying disc", because of its widespread and indiscriminate use, requires definition. Many definitions have been offered, one of the best being that originated by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director of the Dudley Observatory of The Ohio State University, who has taken a scientific interest in the problem of unidentified aerial objects since 1949. Dr. Hynek's definition of the term is "any aerial phenomenon or sighting that remains unexplained to the viewer at least long enough for it to warrant a report about it".(1) Dr. Hynek, elaborating on his definition, says, "Each flying saucer so defined, has associated with it a probable lifetime, it wanders in the field of public inspection like an electron in a field of ions, until 'captured' by an explanation which pins it down to its existence as a 'flying saucer'".(1)

This definition would be applicable to any and all of the sightings which remained unidentified during this study. However, the term "flying saucers" shall be used hereafter in this report to mean a novel, airborne phenomenon, a manifestation that is not a part of or readily explainable by the fund of scientific knowledge known to be possessed by the Free World. This would include such items as natural phenomena that are not yet completely understood, psychological phenomena, or intruder aircraft of a type that may be possessed by some source in large enough numbers so that more than one independent mission may have been flown and reported. Thus, these phenomena are of the type which should have been observed and reported more than once.

Since 1947, public interest in the subject of unidentified aerial objects fluctuated more or less within reasonable limits until the summer of 1952, when the frequency of reports of sightings reached a peak, possibly stimulated by several articles on the subject in leading popular magazines.

Early in 1952, the Air Force's cumulative study and analysis of reported sightings indicated that the many of reports could be accounted for as misinterpretations of known objects (such as meteors, balloons, or aircraft), a few as the result of mild hysteria, and a very few as the result of unfamiliar meteorological phenomena and light aberrations. However, (1) Hynck, J. A., "Unusual Aerial Phenomena", Journal of the Optical Society of America, 43 (4), 311-314, April 1953.

The image contains a photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The object is described as a white disc-shaped object that appeared to move up and down and display a deep red color at times. The text below the image provides a detailed description of the incident observed by an Air Force technician on December 22, 1952.

Case VI (Serial 4822.00)
An instrument technician, while driving from a large city toward an Air Force base on December 22, 1952, saw an object from his car at 1930 hours. He stopped his car to watch it. It suddenly moved up toward the zenith in spurts from right to left at an angle of about 45°. It then moved off to level flight at a high rate of speed, during which maneuver it appeared white most of the time, but apparently rolled three times showing a red side. About halfway through its roll it showed no light at all. It finally assumed a position to the south of the planet Jupiter at a high altitude, at which position it darted back and forth, left and right alternately. Total time of the observation was 15 minutes. Apparently, the observer just stopped watching the object.

Case VII (Serial 2728.00)

A Flight Sergeant saw an object over an Air Force base in Korea at 0842 hours on June 6, 1952. The object was first seen tumbling and spinning actions. It was on an erratic course, first flying straight level, then changing course and disappearing into the sun. It reappeared and was seen flying back and forth across the sun. At one time an F-86 passed between the observer and the object. He pointed it out to another man who saw it maneuvered near the sun.

The UFO appears to have a curved, saucer-like shape with a noted shadow. The text below the diagram states it is Case VIII (Serial 0576.00) and provides a description of an electrician who witnessed the UFO flying on a straight and level course from horizon to horizon, west to east.

Case VIII (Serial 0576.00)

An electrician was standing by the bathroom window of his home, facing west, at 0825 hours on July 31, 1948, when he first sighted an object. He then ran to his wife, I told her an object was outside, and they both observed the object. The object flew on a straight and level course from horizon to horizon, west to east.

Case IX (Serial 0066.00)
A man and his two sons, aged 8 and 10, were at his fishing camp on August 13, 1947. At about 1300 hours, he went to look for the boys. Having sent them to the river for some, he noticed an object some 300 feet away, 75 feet above the ground. He watched it for about 2 minutes as it made a hedge hopping, following the contour of the ground. It was sky blue, about 20 feet in diameter and 10 feet thick, and had pods on the side from which flames were shooting out. It made a hissing sound. The observer stated that the trees were highly agitated by the craft as it passed over. His two sons also observed the object. No one saw the object for more than a few seconds.

Case X (Serial 1119.00)

An employee in the supersonic laboratory of an aeronautical laboratory and some other employees of this lab, were by a river, 2-1/2 miles from its mouth, when they saw an object. The time was about 1700 hours on May 24, 1949. The object was reflecting sunlight when observed by naked eye. However, he then looked at it with 8-power binoculars, at which time there was no glare. (Did glasses have filter?) It was of metallic construction and was seen with good enough resolution to show that the skin was dirty. It moved off in horizontal flight at a gradually increasing rate of speed until it seemed to approach the speed of a jet before it disappeared. No propulsion was apparent. Time of observation was 2-1/2 to 3 minutes.

Case XI (Serial 1550.00)
On March 20, 1950, a Reserve Air Force Captain and an airlines
Captain were flying a commercial airlines flight. At 21:26, the airlines
Captain directed the attention of the Reserve Air Force Captain to an object
which apparently was flying at high speed, approaching the airliner from
the south on a north heading. The Reserve Air Force Captain focused his
attention on the object. Both crew members watched as it passed in front
of them and watch out of sight to the right. The observation, which lasted
about 9 to 10 seconds, estimated the object's speed to be in excess of 1000 mph.
When the object passed in front of the airliner, it was not more than
1/2 mile distant and at an altitude of about 1000 feet higher than the airliner.
The object appeared to be circular, with a diameter of approximately
100 feet and with a vertical height considerably less than the diameter,
giving the object a disc-like shape. In the object's center was a light which was
blinking at an estimated 3 flashes per second. This light was so brilliant
that it would have been impossible to look at it continuously had it not been
blinking. This light could be seen only when the object was approaching
and after it had passed the airliner. When the object passed in front of the
observers, the bottom side was visible. The bottom side appeared to have
9 to 12 symmetrically oval or circular porthole-like openings located in a circle around
the central light. The instant the object passed the airliner, several of these
portholes came a soft purple light about the shade of aircraft running
lights. The object was traveling in a straight line without spinning. Considering the visibility, the length of time the object was in sight, and the
distance from the object, the Reserve Air Force Captain estimates the
speed to be in excess of 1000 mph.

Case XII (Serial 3601.00)

At 0535 on the morning of August 25, 1952, a musician for a radio station was driving to work from his home when he noticed an object hovering about 10 feet above a field near the road along which he was driving. As he came abreast of the object, he stopped his car and got out to watch. Having an artificial leg, he could not leave the road. The object was still, but seemed to rock slightly as if levered. When he turned off the motor of his car, he could hear a deep throbbing sound coming from the object. The sound was similar to "a large covey of quail starting to fly as one time". The object ascended vertically through broken clouds until out of sight. His view was not obscured by clouds. The observer states that the vegetation was blown about by the object when it was near the ground.

Description of the object is as follows:
It was about 75 feet long, 45 feet wide, and 15 feet thick, shaped like two oval meat platters placed together. It was a dull aluminum color, and had a smooth surface. A medium-blue continuous light shone through the one window in the front section. The head and shoulders of one man, sitting motionless, facing the forward edge of the object, were visible. In the midsection of the object were several windows extending from the top to the near edge of the object. The midsection of the ship had a blue light which gradually changed to amber and back, giving an undulating movement. There were no windows, doors or portdholes, vents, seams, etc. visible to the observer on the rear section of the object (viewed at time of ascent). Another identifiable feature was a series of propellers 6 to 12 inches in diameter spaced closely together along the outer edge of the object. These propellers were mounted on a bracket so that they revolved in a horizontal plane along the edge of the object. The propellers were revolving at a high rate of speed.

Investigation of the area soon afterward showed some evidence of vegetation being blown around. An examination of grass and soil samples taken indicated nothing unusual. Reliability of the observer was considered good.

The image does not contain any photograph or visual depiction. It appears to be a scanned page from a document discussing the classification of 12 unidentified sightings into four categories based on their shapes: propeller shape, aircraft shape, cigar shape, and balloon or disc shape. The page outlines the criteria for determining the appropriate category for each sighting, emphasizing the importance of the general shape of the object and the maneuvers it performed, the reliability of the observer and report, the accuracy of the observed elements, and the derivation of the model from good comparisons without any essential conflict. It also explains why it is not possible to deduce a model from the 12 cases that satisfy all the conditions, and provides specific examples of how Cases I and II do not satisfy certain conditions.

These 12 sightings can be classed into four categories on the basis of their shapes, as follows:
(1) Propeller shape - Case I
(2) Aircraft shape - Cases II and III
(3) Cigar shape - Cases IV and V
(4) Balloon or disc shape - Cases VI to XII

The purpose of this section of the study was the conceiving of a model, or models. The requirement that the description be detailed is an important one, and was the easiest to determine in the re-evaluation program. However, a good model ought to satisfy the following conditions as well:
(1) The general shape of the object and the maneuvers it performed should fit the reports of many of the UNKNOWNS and thus explain them.
(2) The observer and the report should be reliable.
(3) The report should contain elements which should have been observed with accuracy, and which eliminate the possibility that the sighting could be ascribed to a familiar object or to a known natural phenomenon.
(4) The model should be derived from two or more good UNKNOWNS between which there is no essential conflict.

It can be shown that it is not possible to deduce a model from the 12 cases that will satisfy all of these conditions.
