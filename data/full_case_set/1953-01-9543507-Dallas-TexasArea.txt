"AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 
WHEN: 31 JUL 53 Squadron, Duncanville, Texas
WHAT: On 31 JUL 53 a sighting report was submitted by this organization. 
APPROVED: 9 AUG 53 
SUMMARY:
- -"APPEARED TO CHANGE COURSE"
- - We observed 15-20 lights as we approached what we thought to be a commercial airliner at about 5,000 feet. They were approximately 1 mile apart, seemed to be traveling faster than normal, and were climbing at about the same rate. 
- - We then discovered the lights were not spaced evenly. They were slightly staggered in several echelons and the formation appeared to be under intelligent control as it "APPEARED TO CHANGE COURSE" slightly as we approached. 
- - We estimated the closest approach at about 25 to 30 miles away and 2,500 feet above our level.
- - The pilot reported getting a very unsual message from Oklahoma City. He had attempted to contact the object by radio but got no reply.
- - Flight to the object was not attempted as the regulation forbids such action. The object(s) were traveling at an estimated speed of 600-700 mph.
NO PARTICIPATION:"

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 
1/5/53 REPORT NO. 11
SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNKNOWN OBJECT NEAR DUNCANVILLE, TEXAS 
1. Is said a number of pilots gathered in the down to watch the "spectacle" when object flew over their area at 8:45 p.m, 1/5/53, and it should know a plane or a star by now. "This wasn't either."

MILITARY OPINION: BALLISTIC MISSILE TEST 
2. Several citizens reported the object was very bright, moving at a rapid rate, and assumed to be a "missile test" of some kind. However, reported sightings an night-flying aircraft are common in this area. Witnesses had a good view of it and are convinced it was not a star, planet, or conventional aircraft. The object changed direction abruptly.

3. Witnesses told there is no known missile test scheduled at that time in that area, and several citizens claimed to the object was much more brilliant than a star or planet. It was observed for over 5 minutes. THE OBJECT WAS NEVER FOUND.

4. Control tower operator at Dallas Naval Air Station said his scope indicated no aircraft in the area at the time the object was seen. He agrees the object was not a star, plane, or satellite.

5. According to an observer whose job is highly important at the air base at 7:20 p.m., a man came in and reported seeing an unknown object "1,000 feet off the ground" which he believed was traveling at an estimated speed of 3,500 MPH, to become one of the more spectacular cases on record.

7. While flying at 25,000 feet, near midnight pilot observed an "unidentified aerial object below the aircraft," which he believed, might have been a missile in flight.

9. Public information officer at Dallas Naval Air Station states the Air Force has been informed of the incident, but he has no other information or details available.

Elongated Object Hangs in Dallas Sky
DALLAS, JAN 9 - A bright, elongated luminous object with a reddish-brown color was observed in the Dallas sky at about 7:30 a.m. today. The object was visible for about 15 minutes and was stationary, except that it pulsated and changed in intensity. After about 15 minutes, the object suddenly disappeared. Several persons reported the sighting to officials of the Civil Aeronautics Administration control tower at Love Field, Dallas, but the object was not detected on radar.

6 January 1953
On 6 Jan 53 between the hours of 0150Z and 0320Z various reports were received on visual observation in the general vicinity of Dallas, Texas. The object was reported to be hovering, then suddenly the other to disappear towards Dallas.
Here is the description of the object that appeared at Poynette, Texas. Object was being viewed in glare with stars found against a dark background. The object changed color from bright to white to light blue. The tail section was 3 to 4 times the length of the object. This tail section was blinking, changing from a fuzzy to a sharp and changed color from orange to red to blue. The tail section was not as bright as the rest of the object. The wing tips and nose would take on a triangular shape and the tail section would become a cylinder for a system of propulsion was noted. The speed of the object was noted as follows: the object covered a 50 mile distance in 3 minutes about 50 miles north of Dallas - an speed in excess of 1000 miles per hour could be calculated. In one instance it hovered, made a slight curve then went practically straight up and disappeared by blinding itself with the glare. This was sighted as UNKNOWN.
The second observation was that the object was triangular in shape and the location was about 2 miles north of Dallas. The intelligence officer at Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas, reported there was no evidence which could have caused the sighting. Interception or identification between the object and aircraft was impossible, Carswell Air Force Base reported no radar contacts with objects in the vicinity. Reported data estimated speeds of over 600 MPH. The location of air traffic in the area is DD-3 three miles NW of Love Field, Dallas, Texas, at TOO feet altitude reported no observations.

CASE NO. (Record - page 2)
An unidentifiable object was observed in the sky, around 6:30 P.M. on 1 January 1953, in the Dallas, Texas area. The object was first sighted at Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas, and was last seen by observers in Dallas, Texas.

According to the document, a civilian at Carswell Air Force Base reported seeing a mysterious object in the sky over Paris, Texas. He claimed to have observed the object for about 30 minutes. The object was described as being circular in shape and metallic in appearance. A radar unit at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, also reported tracking a target by radar in the Paris, Texas area. The radar tracked the object from a point 3 miles southwest of Paris to a point 5 miles northeast of Paris, covering a distance of 8 miles in about 15 minutes. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of 600 knots and at an altitude of 7,500 feet. The time of the initial radar pickup was 6:32. Eleven minutes later, at 6:43, the object disappeared. No other details about the object or its possible identification are provided.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, likely dated January 6, 1953, describing a sighting of an unidentified flying object in the Dallas, Texas area.

The text in the document is as follows:

6 January 1953
Ca 6 Jan 53 between the hours of 0352 and 1332 various reports were received on visual observations of an object in the vicinity of Dallas, Texas. The object was observed from two Air Force bases, one at Duncanville, Texas, and the other at Perrin, Texas.
The object was described as being white, round, and approximately 30 to 50 feet in diameter. The nose section was brilliant white, tail section was fuzzy and changed color from reddish to red to blue. The tail section was not as bright as the nose. The wing tips were said to glow a faintly green and the main body seemed to glow a pale blue color. No sound was reported.
The object was observed to move at a very high speed and the direction of travel appeared to vary. In one instance it hovered, made a slight curve than went practically straight up. On another occasion, it was reported to move a straight and level flight.
The method of observation was visual and the location was 50 miles north of Dallas. The Intelligence officer at Perrin Field, Grand Prairie, Texas, reported there was no evidence which could have caused the sighting. Interception or identification action was taken all visual in nature. Municipal Air Port reported radar contact with object in the vicinity, reported to find and give chase to object for over 600 mph. The location of air traffic in the area: a DC-3 on watch with GCA at Love Field, Dallas, between the hours of 0352 and 1332 did not observe anything unusual.
There is a report received from Duncanville, Texas, 6 Jan 53 between the hours of 0352 and 1332 on an unidentified light seen in the sky northeast of Dallas. The intensity of the light varied and the object appeared to give the impression it was attempting to remain stationary while another object would give the impression of landing or the object as such while another would give the heading in a different direction. The altitude for the object also varied in the many reports. Once the area became aware of the existence of the object, additional reports would give the location in a different area.

CASE 713 (CONTINUED - PAGE 2)
Something unusual in the air, reports come in about 9:00 pm. The object was first sighted at 8:35 pm oo January 6, 1953, the reporting being notified by the CAA Radar at the Meacham Field, Fort Worth, Texas, that they had received numerous calls of an unidentified object sighting in the Dallas, Texas, area.
Civilian flying control officers on duty contacted Lovr Field Traffic Control Tower at Dallas for verification of the sighting. Civilian at Love Field Tower said that the object could be seen from their tower and that the controller had notified all air division command.
Soon after the initial call, Major Barks, Texas, called and stated that he had observed a mysterious object at 0339 hours 6 January with his own eyes. He said the object appeared to be at an altitude of 35,000 feet.
A radar unit at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, reported that they had picked up a target by radar at about 9:00 pm 6 January. The target was heading S from a point 35 miles E of Paris, Texas. The target was traveling at an estimated air speed of 600 knots and at an altitude of 7,500 feet. The time of the initial radar contact was 9:05 pm. Radar contacts were made in that area which could be attributed to the unusual target observed by the civilian at Paris.
The direction of the radar targets, West, and the direction of the object seen by the civilian, South, do not concur and, therefore, are evidently 2 different objects. The radar contacts is believed to have been an aircraft heading for Paris AFB, Texas.
It is believed that one of the objects seen was the upper air research balloon launched at Sypos, Texas, and the radar pickup was jet aircraft in the area.

OCR Text Output:

ON 6 January 1953, between the hours of 0152 and 1318 hours, personnel from the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Turner Air Force Base, Albany, Georgia, who were on a training mission from their base, reported a highly luminous object visually observed west of Dallas, Texas. This object was observed by all personnel on board the aircraft and ground observers at Dallas, Texas. One report would indicate the object was as large as a DC-3 aircraft. It had the appearance of an extremely bright, reddish-orange light and appeared to be disc-shaped. The object was observed on several occasions during the period mentioned and maneuvers indicated it was under intelligent control. No sound was reported by any of the observers. The object disappeared from sight in a vertical climb at a tremendous rate of speed. Some of the pilots and observers feel this to be the kind of object that has been described in numerous "flying saucer" reports.
