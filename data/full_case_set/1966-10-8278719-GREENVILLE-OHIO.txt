Supplemental Report to FTD Form 164
October, 1966

Submitted by [REDACTED]

In Re to Item 10: I observed this object first as a yellow light, much closer than any light. At times it would emit colored lights, to wit: pinkish-red. I would describe it as comparing it to the on top of a police cruiser. Observing the object through binoculars it appeared to have a very brilliant light. It would compare this light and its intensity to such a firing which is occasionally hit by a spotlight at make this comparison from fishing at night with. Jewelry. 

In Re to Item 11: I used the binoculars on the moon and that I could see in the sky, and then would go back to when Williamson set it on the astronomer's telescope, it appeared to be all blue-white, but more white than blue.

In Re to Item 13: I answered this with a modified Yes test appeared to come closer to the earth in a motion that best describe as comparable to a weighted parachute coming down. This comparison is backed on my experience from the army. I also lined up the object with a telephone pole so that we were all a straight line. The object went to the top of the pole and to the right of the pole and traveled up and down in a particular night was extremely and crisp. The Milky Way was prominent and quite obvious.

The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten text describing observations regarding the number of people who have reported unidentified flying objects. The text expresses the author's puzzlement at the large number of respected community members who have reported these observations, stating that they cannot come up with a logical explanation for the events. The text does not identify any individuals, but rather discusses the observations in general terms.

Transcribed text:

I have also been amazed at the number of people who described to me observations which they saw and hesitated reporting. These people are respected members of our community because they couldn't believe their own eyes. Very frankly I am amazed because I cannot come up with an answer that is logical and I realize that this is quite rambling, but these are impressions which impressed let me with. I also realize that this experience (lacking of anything else to call it) is quite extraordinary, and I try to explain to you the basis of my observations.

Respectfully yours,

OCR text output:

IN RE TO ITEM 15: REFER TO COMMENTS ON ITEM 11.
IN RE TO ITEM 17: REFER TO COMMENTS ON ITEMS 11 & 12.
IN RE TO ITEM 18: HAD HE KNOWN OF THIS TEST WOULD HAVE BEEN THE KNOWN OF THE OBJECT, WITH ANY ACCURACY, COULD HAVE REPORTED THE OBJECT ONLY AS I HAVE STATED. MY TENTATIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE OBJECT WAS IN THE SKY AT OBSERVATION.
IN RE TO ITEM 19: AT ALL TIMES, THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A CLEAR CIRCLE. ON ITS OUTSIDE PERIMETER, HOWEVER, AS THE OBJECT CAME TOWARD US, I COULD DISCERNED THREE DISTINCT THINGS. ONE, IT APPEARED TO BE LIKE A MODEL A STEERING WHEEL. SECOND, A SERIES OF CONCENTRIC CIRCLES. THIRD, A HALO WITH THE INTERIOR WITHIN THE OUTSIDE HALO. I SAW NO WING VAPOR TRAILS.
IN RE TO ITEM 22: THE OBJECT IS APPROXIMATELY A CORPORATION LINE OF GREENVILLE. THERE ARE NO STREET LIGHTS VISIBLE AND IS IMMEDIATELY TO THE NORTH IS A 40 ACRE SOYBEAN FIELD. THE OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED FROM THE BEDROOM WINDOW AND WITHIN THE SIGHT OF THE HOME AS WE COULD BETTER SEE IT.
IN RE TO ITEM 23: I HAVE DESCRIBED HERE THE SENSATION OF WHAT I PERCEIVED. I DO NOT THINK I COULD DRAW IT WITH GREATER ACCURACY.
IN COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE, I CAN SAY ONLY THAT A MOST UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE. I HAVE DESCRIBED REPORTS TO BE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL AS A 30 CALIBER STORY HAS GIVEN ME WHAT I FEEL IS A VERY LOW PROBABILITY AND ESTIMATING WHAT I WAS PROBABLY SEEING IN THE SKY. IT IS TRUE THERE WERE DISTORTIONS THAT I CANNOT EXPLAIN BY LOGIC. BUT THE REST, LIKE THE MOVEMENT, I CAN NOT DESCRIBE BY LOGIC. BUT THE REST, LIKE THE MOVEMENT, I CANNOT DESCRIBE BY LOGIC. THE INTELLIGENT MOVEMENT OBSERVED WHO AS RELATED SAID THIS WAS VENUS AND THAT I WOULD BE ADVISED TO FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING QUOTE: IN 2210 ON OCTOBER 9, 1966. THERE WASN'T THERE. THIS THING IS BOTHERING ME FURTHER, DUE TO WHAT SOME RELIGIOUS MAN EXPERIENCED IN THE USE OF OBSERVING AT NIGHT WITH OPTICAL PACT REGISTRATION. I'VE SHOT A LOT OF ARTILLERY SHELLS AND I USED TO BE A FAIR HAND WITH BINOCULARS AND INSTRUMENTS USED IN ARTILLERY. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T ENCOUNTER SLOWLY AND I KNOW THAT FOCUSING OF THE BINOCULARS IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T DO RAPIDLY FROM APRIL TO THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER. I HAVE SEEN ANYTHING THAT COMPARES WITH THIS.

The image contains a photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The object appears to be a dark, elongated shape against a light background.

Text from the document:
I was out of town that Saturday evening and didn't return until late Sunday. I saw the object when I arrived home about 11:30 PM. It just hovered there without changing position. I watched it for about 15 minutes. It was cigar-shaped, solid black, and about the size of a car. It made no sound at all and just floated motionless. I tried to shine my flashlight on it but it didn't seem to have any effect. After about 15 minutes it just disappeared as though it had been turned off. I told my neighbor about it but he said he hadn't seen anything.
