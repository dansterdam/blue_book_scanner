Enclosure #1: There are several unusual things about this reported sighting. It suggests that the radar equipment used at the time of sighting was apparently not functioning properly. There is a mention of additional equipment being used in connection with the maintenance operation, but no details are provided about what this equipment was. The question arises as to whether the antenna was inside the equipment. This question arises since the height of the target was indicated to be as small as the height of the target. It appears to indicate that the antenna was not rotating, suggesting that the antenna was not operating during the time of the incident. Further, regular operating personnel were not present at the time. Hence, it is concluded that possibly a false target due to equipment malfunction was observed on this occasion.
