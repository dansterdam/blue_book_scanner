DATE/TIME: 25/1953
SUMMARY: 
1. At 19:08 (CST) another unidentified air object, same as before (25) was sighted at 19:07z. Object (26) was at approximately 25,000 ft. altitude and was intermittently tracked by radar. Similar object (25) was sighted at 19:07z. 
2. Photographs were taken with scope cameras. Development of film revealed camera damage. 
3. Radar plot: Lackland AFB, Texas
4. Assigned Air Force Personnel, Controllers, Captain Ralph S. Boggart, CWO Edwin R. Robbins, Radar Unit.
5. Weather - Wight Cloud Condition, 2,000 Ft. Scattered Winds, 20 Knots, 200.
6. None
7. Photographs were taken with scope cameras. Development of film revealed camera damage.
8. None due to possible border violation.
9. San Antonio AFB made immediate investigation acted upon by commercial telephone for possible identification. ATICC advised that D-1 336 had no aircraft in that area and that they did not know of any aircraft in that area at that time. However, they concluded that the target was not an aircraft.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Unidentified Aerial Objects
Mexico City, Mexico
4 August 1953 - 26 August 1953

1. The following is in response to CFIT IO-511 dated 4 August 1953:
On 25 August, the writer, on a periodic visit to Mexican Air Force headquarters, had a conference with General Augusto Aguirre Castillo, Commanding General, Mexican Air Force.

2. During the conversation, it was learned that a number of 5247 type aircraft, with the designation "F2H", which were being operated by the Mexican Air Force, had encountered difficulties in connection with their normal flight operations. It appears that the difficulties were experienced during cloud seeding operations. The pilots had reported that their aircraft "stalled" and made violent maneuvers while operating at altitudes in cloud seeding operations.

TEXAS LACKLAND (U.S.A.F.)
6 MAY 1953
The following is a report of a sighting of an unidentified flying object made by Airman First Class Raymond P. Ryan of the 271st Air Police Squadron, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, at approximately 2330 hours on the evening of 5 May 1953.
Ryan was on routine patrol at the northwest corner of the base when he noticed a bright light in the southern sky at an approximate altitude of 2000 feet. The light appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed toward the northeast. It was observed for a period of about 2 minutes and then disappeared from sight.
In Ryan's opinion the light was not an aircraft, meteor, or any other known object. He described it as being a bright white light approximately the size of a match head when viewed at arm's length. No sound was heard.
Ryan immediately reported the incident to the Base Operations Officer and the Base Commander. An investigation was conducted by these officers and a statement was obtained from Ryan. The Airman's report was considered to be credible.

REQUEST FOR AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION DATA:

THRU: ATTN: CAPT; AAIC-1
TO: ATIC

SUBJECT: (CLOG) Unidentified Aerial Objects

1. PERTINENT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
(Secret) ATIC has received a report from a radar site at San Antonio, Texas, concerning the visual and radar sightings of several unidentified objects over Lackland AFB, Texas, on 15 May 1953. Five or more targets appeared to be orbiting over the base for 15 to 20 minutes. They appeared on the radar scope as unnatural sights and intermittent contact was maintained for over 20,000 ft. No speed estimates was possible.

2. SPECIFIC REQUEST:
(Confidential) It is requested that a determination be made if Mexican aircraft were in the area at the time of sighting. The number and maneuvers of the targets suggest military aircraft. There are fields at 1) Monterrey, and 2) Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, which can be checked.
