There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The document appears to be text-based, describing a local air traffic control unit and a potential photoflash bomb drop area. The text indicates that officials of the air unit stated that no drops have been made since 1955, and that the sighting may have been of a "met nature" as many sightings have been reported in the area.

The text from the document is as follows:

LOCAL ANG TACFICON UNIT AS A PHOTOFLASH BOMB DROP AREA: HOWEVER, OFFICIALS OF THE ANG UNIT STATE NO DROPS HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE 19 SEP 55. IT IS POSSIBLE THE PHOTOFLASH BOMB DROP AREA WAS IN USE AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING BY AN ORGANIZATION OUTSIDE OF THIS AREA. ONE OTHER POSSIBILITY COULD BE THAT THE SIGHTING WAS OF A MET NATURE SINCE MANY SIGHTINGS HAVE CURRENTLY BEEN REPORTED IN THIS AREA.
