There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a Project Blue Book record card documenting a sighting characteristic of a meteor. The text on the card provides details about the sighting, including the date, location, type of observation, source, number of objects observed, length of observation, and a brief summary of the sighting. The summary describes the object as a "Very white bright sphere w/lights like portholes w/short reddish tail like a rocket exhaust in ship to come out of clouds fm edge true & disappear into clouds at 1000dr true after flight of 5-7 seconds. No sound. Steady flight of 20-odd true, believed to be in course of 200 dir. No estimation on size."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report of a flying object seen over the Atlantic Ocean on October 18, 1958.

The text of the report is as follows:

Department: Investigation U.F.O.'s.

Report of flying object seen over the Atlantic Ocean

On the 18th October 1958 the Dutch M.V. Goedkind, Captain Vries (C.H.), under way from Norfolk, (U.S.A.), to Rotterdam (Holland), was Officer on the First Watch when he sighted what he described as a very strange object.

At A 22:20 ship's time (00:20 G.M.T.) the estimated position being 46°22'N, 19°25'W, the lookout called attention to an object, which at first they took for a shooting star. But as it came closer they were able to identify it as a lighted object, about the size of a medium sized aircraft moving at great speed, about 2 or 3 times the speed of a jet plane.

I.: A very bright, absolutely white light, giving the impression of a solid object.
II.: A lighted connection, looked like a row of lighted portholes.
III.: A steady bright light in the center, brighter than the rest.
IV.: It was already about 200 yards away from a "rocket" the planes have sighted, this being no more than 5 minutes old. 

Captain Vries, at once warned the Captain at once, who also saw the object. It was large, under perfect control and seemed to give off a phosphorescent glow. It appeared to be about 1/2 mile wide. We saw it for about 30 seconds, low. It would say about 1000 to 1200 mph. The object's width, from head to stern, the height was difficult to say. but as I read that the captain intends to send a report to the Dutch Navy.

Philadelphia, 20-11-1958: A Captain informs that on the 18th October 1958 he received the report from Captain Vries.
