The image contains a photograph of a newspaper article reporting on "Fiery Object Lights Sky Over Michigan". The article describes sightings of a flaming green object streaking across the sky over Michigan on February 24, 1959. It states that radio stations received calls from excited citizens who saw the object, and that the operators of the Grand Rapids airport control towers also witnessed it. The article includes details about the sighting as reported by John Moore and Boyan Boylan, who described the object as a "good-sized one" that appeared to be disintegrating.

FIERY OBJECT LIGHTS
SKY OVER MICHIGAN

EAST LANSING, MICH., Feb. 24-UPI - A flaming "blush
green" object streaked over Michigan about 6:30 a.m. today,
traveling from east to west. Radio stations had calls from
excited citizens who also saw the object.

Two operators in the control tower of the Grand Rapids
airport in western Michigan said they believed it was a
meteorite. The operators, John Moore and Boyan Boylan, said
"it (the object) also was sighted at airport control towers in Chicago
and Madison, Wis.

"It was a dandy," Moore and Boylan agreed. "The best
we could see, it must have been a good-sized one. When we first
saw it, it looked like it was just northwest of Grand Rapids
and was shooting off sparks before it appeared to disintegrate."

The sky was clear and before dawn and observers got a
good look at the object, radio station WKAR in Houghton Lake in north central
Michigan received a call from a man at nearby Roscommon
who said, "It scared hell out of me."
