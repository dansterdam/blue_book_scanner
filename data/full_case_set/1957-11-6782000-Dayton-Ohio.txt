Venus Most Prominent

Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the western sky. It soon be joined by the "leonids," "shooting stars."

By JAMES STOKLEY
First brilliant object you see in the western sky these evenings at dark is the planet Venus, now shining as a splendid evening star. Venus is the planet nearest to the Earth, and of all the planets, it is the one most often seen. It has been observed since the earliest times, and has played an important part in the thinking and beliefs of many peoples.

Venus comes and goes at regular intervals. At the present time it is to be seen in the west after the sun has set, because Venus is on the opposite side of the sun from the Earth. But after a few more months, it will be lost in the solar glare and will not be seen for a while.  

To the naked eye, Venus appears as a brilliant point of light, far brighter than any of the stars. It often casts a shadow, and can be seen in the daytime if you know where to look for it. The brilliance of Venus is not at all constant, but varies considerably with the changing angle at which we see its sunlit side. When Venus is between the Earth and the sun, we see it nearly full, and it is then at its brightest. This is the time when it appears as the "evening star." But when it is on the far side of the sun, we see only a small crescent, and it is then much fainter. This is called the "morning star" stage.

Orion's Season's Finest

This is Orion, the warrior, easily recognized as one of the most conspicuous constellations in the winter sky. The three bright stars forming his "belt" are the most familiar part of the figure. To the right as Rigel, both of the first magnitude, forming the shoulders of the giant. Betelgeuse, the reddish star, marks Orion's right shoulder, and Bellatrix his left.

Orion is beginning to appear in the east as the night falls earlier now. By mid-evening it is high overhead, in the familiar pose, with his club raised. He is the dominant figure in the southern sky and will remain so throughout the winter season until spring.

Bright stars in the sky

These main stars, which now show the stars are "winking." From left to right the stars are Deneb, at the top of the cross known as Cygnus the Swan, Vega, the brightest star in Lyra, and Altair, the bright star in Aquila. These three stars form the "Summer Triangle," which is high in the western sky as the evening falls. Deneb is in the bird's tail; in fact, the word "Deneb" is Arabic and means "tail." These are the three bright stars in the familiar summer sky.

But the eye is drawn first to Orion, the giant warrior, as he strides across the southern heavens. His long legs, stretched forward, his club arm upraised, makes a striking picture against the starry background. Below Orion is another famous winter constellation, Taurus, the Bull, with the bright star Aldebaran, one of the best known in the winter sky, marking the Bull's eye.

The symbols for stars in order of brightness are: first magnitude, second and third magnitude, and so on to sixth magnitude, the faintest that can be seen with the naked eye.

"At Fargo, North Dakota, Fargo Forum photographer Alf T. Olsen saw and photographed a "design-shaped object" which hovered in view for several minutes about noon on November 9th. He was able to get three shots, one of which shows two additional circular objects in the vicinity of the larger object (No details are available concerning corroborating reports.)"

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN 2PM, MAY 27 AND 6PM, MAY 28, 1957?

"EDITORIAL NOTE: The Miller case, from 1955 to 1956, is the details of a "close encounter of the third kind" case which was reviewed in the time-July 1957 issue of SAUCERS magazine. This case, in which the witness is identified as "MILLER", appeared in the same-July 1957 issue of SAUCERS. Mr. Miller was again first prize in our Giant Library Contest for facts of sightings and the publication of his experiences with his second "FLYING SAUCER" like object".

Most of us recall the tremendous quantity and quality of UFG sightings reported that occurred from September 27th, 1957. While this "flap" was of short duration, it was nevertheless one of the most intensive since 1947, various observers and ground reports at times indicating simultaneous sightings at three or more locations. Phenomena of all types were recorded - such phenomena as discs, spheres, cigars, and large irregular masses emitting lights and the like. Military and civilian airports were swamped with calls from persons reporting unidentified aerial objects. Honolulu reported its activity was checked when a Pan American Airlines pilot returning from Wake Island landed and said he had followed a fast-moving light that had crossed his path and disappeared at the horizon. Costa Guard stations on both coasts, and the interior, made numerous reports. Some of the saucer aircraft reported were estimated to be moving as fast as 14,000 mph, with incredible acceleration and maneuvers.

The data of the air-liners. In fact, the entire matter was essentially administrative. This question of policy and regulations were kept under wraps until after the April-May 1957 report had been filed. The civil defense people and the weather people were making "private property" claims regarding the observations. A number of competent scientists "pooh-poohed" the whole matter.

Clipper 944 departed from San Francisco at 7:51 GCT (Greenwich Civ Time), November 23th, 1957. No equipment failures or irregularities were reported. The pilots sighted a bright light, described as a rapidly moving sphere or globular object. This was the first UFO sighting reported by commercial airline pilots in over a year. The pilots' observations were forwarded to CONAC and ATIC.

American First Officer William E. Nash and Second Officer William H. Fortenberry, aboard a National Airlines Constellation, sighted an unidentified aerial object near Miami, Florida about 7:15 PM EST, July 14, 1952. This was the first UFO sighting reported by airline pilots. The pilots' observations were forwarded to Air Force intelligence.

The U.S. Air Force seems to have developed a keen interest in gathering all the data of the air-liners. In fact, the entire matter was essentially administrative. This question of policy and regulations were kept under wraps until after the April-May 1957 report had been filed. The civil defense people and the weather people were making "private property" claims regarding the observations. A number of competent scientists "pooh-poohed" the whole matter.

Proceeding to act as an OCR system to extract the text from the document:

Arian Passage was at 0137c, but nothing unusual was reported. The airliner was then designated "unrepntrted."
As previously stated.
The air traffic controller radar was, however, inoperative at the time. and the visual observation was lost as the airliner passed from his night radar observation,
As for the investigators, no radar evidence or physical evidence of any kind was located during the investigation.
The evidence of the radarman's report indicating the passage of some unidentified object was inconclusive. No confirmation by any other source could be obtained, and it is felt that the radarman's report was inaccurate or mistaken. Consequently, the case was classified as "unidentified."
External examination of the bodies was made, carefully noting all exterior injuries, etc. No evidence of any irregular entry was found. There was no evidence of any damage to the airliner after the airliner had crashed. This evidence of an irregular explosion in the air was lacking.
The fact that no 15-minute transmission was received, however, indicated the presence of sodium sulfite in the flash, a violent reaction being apparent, and the condition of the bodies indicating that they were dead before the airliner crashed. A small amount of radio-activity marking was also on board the airliner.
The final conclusion was equivocal. No evidence of a second aircraft was validated with two high frequency radio transmitting systems equipped with SPECIAL Radio equipment indicating the need for continuous pilot monitoring. No radar confirmation could be obtained, and it is felt that the radarman's report was inaccurate or mistaken. Finally, doubt was cast on why impact damage wasn't at least one of the airliners transmitters -- or SIGNALSused that could possibly have happened to prevent the pilot's first critical communication. The airliner was 20 miles off course, for a reason unknown. The airliner could never have landed if their condition had occurred during the mission!

Dayton, Ohio. Sighting reported 6 Nov 57 at 7:15 p.m. 
Witness: Mr. ----, age 53, of 5 Orange St., Dayton, Ohio. Occupation: Manager, Dayton Plumbing Supply Co. 
Narrative: Witness was driving his car east on the Rte. 4 Bypass, approximately 7 miles west of Dayton, when he observed a bright light approaching from the southwest. The light appeared to be about 10,000 ft. in altitude and was moving at high speed, approximately 800-1,000 mph. The light was very bright, brighter than a star, and appeared to be surrounded by a glow or haze. As the light approached, it suddenly increased in size, then decreased in size, then blinked out. The total duration of the sighting was about 10 seconds.
Witness stated that the object was traveling much faster than any jet aircraft he had ever seen, and that it maneuvered in a manner that no known aircraft could duplicate. Witness was quite disturbed by the incident and felt that he had observed some kind of "flying saucer" or unidentified aerial object. 
The Air Force investigation concluded that the sighting was probably of a meteor or natural phenomenon, despite the witness' insistence that the object was under intelligent control and maneuvered in an unconventional manner.

The CAA report admittedly offers no explanation for the crash, and it probable source of CO (carbon monoxide), the report stated, "would be an unusual occurrence which could happen such as failure which would release part of the passenger cabin.The report also stated, "Such an occurrence could be accompanied by an auto flight control system failure which may propel the aircraft beyond control capabilities, and destroy equipment, take emergency evacuation procedures inoperative and destroy any other possibilities."

Dear Colonel Gregory:

A month ago I wrote the Air Force Press Desk requesting information on the subject of UFOs. I received a letter stating that because of the difficulties involved you could not furnish me with any information. However, I wish to write again to assure that I will. It seems that action is being taken by your office to be extremely careful about UFOs, and I don't really expect to hear from you as a result.

I request the following information: The official Air Force explanation as to the reason for the UFO seen by Mr. E in Cuyahoga County, Ohio on December 5, 1957. It was seen for several minutes. The Air Force has knowledge of it, and I would appreciate your official explanation, if any.

Occasionally I do make a thorough investigation of what I consider exceptional good UFO sightings. It is thought that the Air Force was really uninterested in their apparent attitude of being too busy or the UIO problem, and perhaps something about the case which you don't know about.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this scanned document page from Project Blue Book. The page contains handwritten text that appears to be a letter from an individual named Major J. Friend regarding UFO sightings. 

The text of the document is as follows:

Major J. Friend
ATIC
Wright Patterson Field, Ohio 

Dear Major Friend,

I received a very hastily written note from your friend Dan Fenton in which he stated that he accompanied a friend of some Newsweek correspondents to Naples, Italy. Believe he wants to meet with Trevor James who he says borrowed from him actually money he wrote in such haste. I am not sure if he meant just the quote "they live in the sky" the author has given as a possible reason why governments are loath to reveal what has been deduced the theory that could upset scientific and religious theory may soon invade.

However, I believe that there may be some highly placed man of signal ability who already know a great deal and who will be the agency through which this information will be passed on to the nation.

Supporting this viewpoint is the report that General Douglas MacArthur had made a statement to the effect that before year 15 nations to New York by Satellite in October 1954 believes that because of the development of science, all countries on earth will have to unite to survive and to make common front against an attack from other plants and quote.

As he has done before, the politics would involve making planets. He quoted the late Einstein who was asked what weapons would be used in the third world war, replied, "I know not, but I do know that the fourth world war would be fought with sticks, clubs and stones."

I am in complete agreement. I certainly abhor the stories being told by the liberal correspondents. If this country could control the pressures of potential enemies, we would not have the problems to such an extent startled this area with his news be watched a UFO land. I thought it was a brilliant idea. I did not think these things existed in my own back yard. Because I sincerely thought these things existed in the mind of science friction writer, I watch them, there is no logical explanation for this object or the hurry. I receive while I watched. Or the strange alteration in body stands. I suppose it is all in imaginative minds and could not have come in best. I wonder about the consequences.

that had been so healthy when shown at dog shows...she died full of cancer. Or the bitch that whirled a little of our monstrosity. Thank God I was present of UFO, and I had learned these fool cancer full correct if I was not, they would have been killed right after night. somehow an unknown was here. I guess injury like a story heard from another man who had been burned by these things is no proof. either is no photograph to show the old of wanting 2 red lighits that worked all night. And people like us approched to see what had happened to him. I admit I am surprised to have him saying me to send you data for I did not know he was assisting your department. Of course I know him only slightly. For he has been liked with my rechnical to use my story for public relenies. I would feel like a testmonial for God only know what, and yet perhaps I am wrong for hind instance could actually be married, I surely would not have remained out to look.

The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains a diagram showing the positions and relative brightness of various celestial bodies, as well as some accompanying text discussing the prominence of the planet Venus in the evening sky.

Transcribed text from the document:

ASTRONOMY

Venus Most Prominent

Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the "morning stars."

As JAMES STOKEY
Staff writer reports we are in
the midst of a period when Venus
is most prominent in the evening
sky. This is an event that occurs
about every 19 months and is
known as the greatest elongation
of Venus. This means that the
planet appears at its greatest
distance from the sun as seen from
the Earth. It is this event, coupled
with the fact that Venus is now
between the Earth and the sun,
that makes the planet shine so
brilliantly in the evening sky.

After the Venus passes between
the Earth and the sun, it becomes
too close to the sun to be seen and
disappears from the evening sky.
Then as it swings around to the
other side of the sun, it reappears
in the morning sky, becoming a
"morning star." It will continue to
be seen in the early morning sky
until next April, when it will again
pass between the Earth and the
sun and become a "morning star."

The diagram below shows the
relative positions of the planets
and the major stars of the sky for
this time of year. The bright star
near the top of the diagram is
Aldebaran, the bright star in the
constellation Taurus. Below it are
the Pleiades, a famous star cluster.

Bright Birds in the sky

There are numerous bright celestial objects in the
evening sky now, in addition to Venus. Saturn, the
ringed planet, is high in the southwest after sunset,
and the brilliant star Arcturus, which is part of the
constellation Bootes, may be seen in the northwest.

The most prominent object in the sky, however, is
Venus, which will soon be joined by Jupiter and
Saturn as the "morning stars." As the evening wears on,
a group forming the letter M will appear low in the
northeast. This, of course, is the well-known Big Dipper,
which is part of the constellation Ursa Major, the Great
Bear.

What is generally considered to be the brightest
star in the sky, however, is Sirius, the Dog Star, which
becomes more prominent in the southeastern sky each
evening as winter approaches.

The Crescent Moon's Phase

This is Orion's Season
The appearance of Orion in the evening sky marks
the arrival of winter. This famous constellation, with
its distinctive three stars in a row forming Orion's Belt,
is already high in the south at nightfall and will be
setting in the west by midnight. The stars of Orion have
been used by navigators since ancient time to determine
directions.

During the month, the crescent moon will appear low
in the southwest on November 13 and we will then
have a nearly full moon from the 14th to the 16th. Then
from the 17th to the 23rd, a waning moon will appear
in the morning sky. A new moon will occur on November
29. Thus, the cycle of lunar phases from new to full and
back again is clearly evident this month.
