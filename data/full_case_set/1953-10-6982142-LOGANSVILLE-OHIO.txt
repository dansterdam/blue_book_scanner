Gentlemen:
I thought you might be interested in the fact that we saw a flying saucer last night. It had come close and I had gone out of the house and called, "Have you ever seen a flying saucer?" I answered, "Be careful and look." As I got out of the car, it could see it through the windshield disappearing to the south, but I did not see it any closer.
At first, it was traveling from east to west, then turned abruptly northerly. Going very fast. It was large and round in shape and had a glow "like a lot of lights". 
Hoping this will help you in some way, I remain
Yours truly,
[Redacted]

Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
