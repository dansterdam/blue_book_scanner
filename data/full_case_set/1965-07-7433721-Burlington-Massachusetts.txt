The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book record, which is a document related to the U.S. Air Force's investigations of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, specifically a "MEMO ROUTING SLIP" from Project Blue Book, dated July 23, 1965.

The text in the document is as follows:

The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, rather than a photograph. It depicts a landscape with some mountains or hills, a road or street, and a house or building. There are also some handwritten notes and markings on the image.

The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will produce the following text found in the document:

DST Dan H. Manning, USAF, 14 Jul 65
to carry on the investigation of the unidentified flying object sighted by Mr. Paul E. Bowen, West Memorial Drive, Burlington, Mass., on July 16, 1965.
The object was first observed at approximately 10:00 PM and was under observation for a period of about 15 minutes. It made no sound and appeared to be oval or circular in shape with a bright glow or luminous, with a slightly darker center. No trails or exhaust were observed. It moved slowly and erratically, appearing to hover and then move off rapidly. 
The location that I would like to check is Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire and Wheeler AFB in Massachusetts. I would also like to check the records of the FAA and the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center on the date in question to determine if any other reports were received concerning this incident.
Please let me know if you have any other questions.
Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
