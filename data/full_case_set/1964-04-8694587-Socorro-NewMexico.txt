GIRL SAYS SHE WAS BURNED WHILE WATCHING UFO HERE
SOCORRO - Over unidentified flying objects continued at a high pace here today.
A 12-year-old girl said she was burned while watching a UFO yesterday afternoon.
Sharon Stull was burned on her face, arms and head when a flying object approached here and two mysterious objects appeared in the sky, according to reports.
The series of incidents started when a policeman reported seeing a brilliant object in the sky. Socorro UFO experts from the University of the county say there have been no other reports of the severity of the incident like that of Sharon Stull.
A doctor said the girl had some inflammation of the eyes and face, both of which were reddened. The inflammation was said to be consistent with sunburn.
"The man explained he had never seen anything like this and did the best he could for treatment," her doctor said. "It obviously was not a normal burn."
Sharon was treated at the Socorro General Hospital last night and was kept at home today with her blindfolded eyes and blistered face and eyes.
"One official" said "it would be possible in some cases to be blinded if they look directly at a UFO for too long. Sharon may have looked directly at the object as she said she did."
Trucks draw as Napoleon.
Two other children also glanced at the object, but were not seriously affected, it was said.
Sharon's doctor said he was "concerned about the condition of her eyes" and was hoping the burns would not scar.
Federal Aviation Agency officials said they have seen nothing unusual in the sky or on their radar screens. Air planes appear only as small dots on the screens, and is possibly a UFO could be distinguished from an airplane on radar.

"Flying Saucer" Reports Spread In New Mexico

SANTA FE (UPI) -- New Mexico's perennial addiction to flying saucers has taken hold of the state again with reports to police over the weekend of a latest object which, according to the Air Force and the FBI, was spotted early Saturday morning at La Madera, about 50 miles north of Santa Fe. State Police Captain Hector Barela said, "There was definitely something there."

Orlando Gallegos, of Santa Fe, told the State Police that he saw the object within 200 feet of a huge object that looked like two saucers, one on top of the other. He said it was about 40 to 45 feet in diameter, with a pole and about 14 feet in circumference. The State Police said the report did not seem to be either a hoax or a hallucination.

A similar report came from a Lonnie Moore, who said he spotted an object near Socorro, N.M. Friday evening. Moore said the object rose slowly from the ground and moved away. 

Similar reports came from Albuquerque, motorists and Air Force men driving in the La Madera area. The Albuquerque motorists, George Herrera, told the local paper, the "object was like a silver looking thing." It disappeared over a mountain in the distance.

In both the Socorro and the La Madera reports, the object were reported to have landed, approached and burned. Also found were "paw prints, like a mountain lion's" as well as landing gear impressions in the dirt. Until the recent spottings, the last unidentified flying object was spotted in New Mexico near Cline last year when a campus policeman at the University of New Mexico reported seeing a strange object flying at the same time.

The article discusses a reported UFO sighting near Socorro, New Mexico, and the subsequent investigation by the Air Force and local authorities. There is no photograph included in this particular page of the document.

Text extracted from the document:

SOCORRO (UPI) - It was shiny and stood on four girders like a land-landing craft. 
But when he moved closer to the object Friday evening, patrolman Lonnie Zamora said it took off with a tremendous roar, leaving scorched grass and brush where it had been.
Zamora said he didn't know what it was, but officials at Kirtland Air Force Base said they would investigate the sighting.
Zamora, 31, and State Police said they saw the mysterious object about 5:45 p.m. Friday on a seldom used dirt road about six miles southwest of Socorro. They took six others to the sight, but the object had disappeared.
Zamora said the object was oval-shaped, about 12-15 feet long. It appeared to be about 10 feet off the ground and 500 yards from the patrol car when first sighted.
The patrolman said the object took off at a tremendous speed, leaving a blue flame and smoke in its wake.

New Documentary Film

A new 80-minute documentary film on UFOs, entitled "Phenomena-Seven Point Seven", was nearing release date as this issue was closed.  

The moving picture was prepared by Empire Film Studios. The movie is officially explained the title: "Seven Point Seven means the 7.7% of an estimated 5,000 sightings classified as UFOs by the Air Force." (This figure is 663 out of 6,998 cases, which works out as 7.44%.)

One of the main sequences shows the now widely-known case of the Socorro, N.M. highway patrol, sighted an oval-shaped craft near Socorro. When he left his police car for a closer look, the strange machine rose with a tremendous roar and shot out of sight.  

Landing-gear marks and scattered terrain were checked by investigators. Later, Hynek stated he did not doubt Zamora's report, and that the had no explanation. 

Zamora described the encounter to investigators as a "top believability rating" in support of Roger Green's feature article on "Phenomena-Seven Point Seven". Even more surprising, in May Jacks' letter to NICAP member Robert Broach, Hynek suggested the UFO as a "vehicle from outer space".

However, this official admission that the UFO was some kind of vehicle, is a long-and under-stood from those who have investigated the phenomena of UFOs - apparitions, delusions, etc.

For this reason, the new film may have a strong impact. The original Socorro report and wide publicity, but to date it is understood that the producers have been admitting the UFO was a strange vehicle, nature unknown. If it had, this probably would have been a front-page story, focusing serious attention to the object.

Documentary Film - Cont. p. 4 col. 1

Empire Film Studios says the documentary is designed to show that neither hysteria nor publicity causes people to see these strange phenomena. The first showing will be at Socorro, then the film will NICAP local review and report on "Phenomena-Seven Point" as soon as possible.

SOCORRO, N. M., April 29 (AP)--An astronomer who examined the strange object seen here by a policeman took soil samples today in an effort to determine what it was.
Dr. J. Allen Hynek said he would visit the site where the policeman, Lonnie Zamora, said he saw a luminous, egg-shaped object land and then take off, causing the ground to burn.
Zamora said the object was about 20 feet long and 15 feet wide and had red lettering on its side. Authorities found scorched grass and indentations in the ground at the Socorro site and near Espanola, 30 miles away.
Dr. Hynek said he hoped to finish his investigation here today. He said he has found most people present and sincere in reporting flying object sightings, though some "unexplained natural phenomena, re birds, weather balloons, even stars, are often responsible for such reports." He noted the reports often come from persons who are something involved in the event - like the Socorro policeman.

Text from the document:

A 20-year-old patrolman, Officer Lonnie Zamora, was fired six shots at a low-flying object on April 24, 1964 near Socorro, New Mexico. State Policeman Tommy Richardson of Moriarty received a telephone call from Don Adams of Edgewood about 1:45 p.m. today.

Adams said he saw the object which appeared to be a fluorescent or glowing, green-colored object about 25 feet long. It had the officer he drove his car under the object and his car stalled. The youth reported he then got out and saw six shots being fired at the object by a uniformed officer, presumably Zamora.

There were two other sightings in the same area near Espanola. All the sightings were similar in that they describe oval or egg-shaped objects with a metallic surface which left a scorched earth at the site, and rose from the ground and took off at a high rate of speed, leaving no evidence of landing gear.

Military bases say they have no such aircraft fitting the descriptions included.

Reports from Monday night included:
1) A man who refused to identify himself because he said he would be laughed at, said he saw a ball of red flame land near Las Vegas. He made no estimate of the size of the ball.
2) He said he was going from Lake McAllister to Las Vegas when he saw the object.

He said he spotted what appeared to be a pair of white overalls near the saucer, but could not tell if anything or anyone was in them. The object, about the height of a car, but larger, appeared to be made of a shiny, aluminum-like substance. A moment later, it flew slowly after the gas disappeared within about 100 yards, he said.
TWO INVESTIGATING officers were at the scene yesterday from Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque. Maj. William Connor and Sgt. David Moody used a Geiger counter to check the area. where the only evidence of an unusual visitor was a burned bush and four small depressions in the ground.
Zamora said the machine had been supported by a round, blue leglike object, and the bush supposedly was burned by exhaust from the saucer. He said he first saw the object from about 200 yards away and thought it was an overturned automobile. He said it was smoking.
Zamora said he also saw what looked like white coveralls, but could not tell if anyone - or anything - was in them. 
DRIVING to within 100 feet of the object, the policeman said he saw what looked like red lettering on the side of the object. He said it then rose from the ground and sailed off in a westerly direction, never getting more than 20 feet off the ground and narrowly missing a dynamite shack.
Holder said he checked with both White Sands and nearby Holloman Air Force Base. Neither base, he said, is using any object comparable to Zamora's machine. Government agencies will continue the investigation, Holder said."

ANOTHER FLYING SAUCER
This One Egg-Shaped and Shiny, Says Policeman 
By CHARLES RICHARDS
United Press International
SOCORRO, N.M. (UPI)--It's a good place for a flying saucer. Right on the edge of White Sands Missile Range on the wide open New Mexico desert, just 30 miles northwest of this site of the world's first atomic blast--Socorro Policeman Lonnie Zamora says he saw it, and police and military men seem to believe him.
Zamora is a very reliable witness," White Sands Missile Range, said T. Holder, uprange commander. "He told us what he saw and we believe him."
Deputy Sheriff James Luckie said he believes "it's some kind of shiny, aluminum-like substance." 
"I was scared," Zamora said. He said his experience "taughthim one thing--he will still run away like he did Friday, but he will not tell a soul" about what he saw.
Zamora said he spotted an egg-shaped object on the desert a mile south of Socorro. He denied seeing any signs of life around the object and said its "maneuver--rose--and flew slowly away until it faded from sight."
He said he spotted what appeared to be a pair of "white coveralls" near the saucer, but could not tell if anything or anyone was in them--the object, Zamora said, "just took off."
"It was something out of the ordinary, something ever flown away about 100 yards, he said. Two investigators from Kirkland Air Force Base in Albuquerque--Maj. William Romer and Sgt. David Moody--used Geiger counters to check the area, where the only evidence was a burnt-bush four to six feet wide and deep in the ground. Zamora said the machine-like depressions in the ground had been supported on the ground by four spider-like legs. He said the object took off with a roar and apparently with some kind of blast or exhaust from the saucer. Holder said the checki by both White Sands and nearby Holloman Air Force Base, he is using any object comparable to a machine. Government agencies will continue the investigation.

Edgewood Man Says He Shot 
At and Hit Flying Object 
BY United Press International

A man living near the Philips air-
craft "mining radar" installations in a 
desert town about 15 miles southeast 
of Socorro, N. M., claims he shot at and 
hit a baffling aerial object there on the 
night of April 24, 1964, according to 
Project Blue Book files of the U.S. Air 
Force.

Don Adams of Edgewood, a former 
enlisted man in the U.S. Air Force, said 
that while working outdoors in the early 
morning hours he saw a brightly lit, 
silvery object hovering about 100 feet 
above the ground near a mesa east of 
Albuquerque.

According to the report, Adams said 
he took a .30-30 rifle and fired at the 
object. He told Air Force investigators 
he could see the object suddenly "jerk" 
and descend rapidly below the horizon
line, as if it had been hit.

The report states that a few hours 
later that same morning, an employee 
of the station reported seeing a ball of 
fire descend slowly towards the area 
where the sighting had occurred. The 
employee apparently was frightened by
what he saw, and left the station, 
fearing the unknown object might be a 
"downed aircraft."

The official Air Force files also state 
that Adams was able to retrieve some 
"metal fragments" from the general 
area of the sighting which he believes 
may be wreckage from the object he 
engaged. The fragments have been sub-
mitted for analysis.

Police Capt. Martin Vigil, who in-
vestigated the incident, is reported to 
have initially thought there was some-
thing unusual at the scene, but later 
decided it was merely a reflection from 
an "aircraft coming into Albuquerque." 
However, the report states that the Air 
Force considers the Adams account to
be "probable" and has not been able to 
explain satisfactorily what Adams saw 
and engaged with rifle fire.

The image does not contain any photographs, only text. I will proceed to extract all the text from the image:

There was no evidence of markings of any sort in the area other than the shallow depressions at the location where Mr. Zamora reported sighting the object.

Laboratory analysis of soil samples disclosed no foreign material or radiation above background for the surrounding area.

Laboratory analysis of the burned brush showed no chemicals which would indicate a type of propellant. 

There was no evidence presented that the object was extraterrestrial in origin or represented a threat to the security of the United States.

The Air Force is continuing its investigation and the case is still open.

For several days following this report, other sightings were reported in the New Mexico area. In each case the sightings were determined to be a known object or natural phenomena. Two of the reports were determined to be hoaxes.

PHYSICAL SAUCER REPORTS SPREAD IN NEW MEXICO

SOCORRO N.M. – Policeman Lonnie Zamora reported seeing a 40 foot oval shaped object rise abruptly from the desert near Socorro and depart. The object bore insignia similar to those described on flying saucers. This report and others have resulted in an official Air Force inquiry in the area.

More UFO Sightings Are Reported Over Wide Area
By the Associated Press
State officers and the military are investigating more unidentified flying objects.
The reports came from Socorro, the Espanola area, and Almagordo, N.M.
Vigil said investigators from Kirtland Air Force Base at Almagordo have been investigating some of the reports.
All of the reported sightings were similar to that they described flames surrounding the craft when seen on the ground for longer periods.
An unidentified girl, about 18, told Socorro officers Bill Flyind that she saw an object like a "flying saucer" fly away from the city officer's home Sunday night, where the officer had attempted to photograph it. She said she ran about 200 feet from the fire, when she thought the flashlight she was wearing became too bright.
About the report from Gallegos, State Police Capt. Martin Vigil said, "There was definitely something there." Gallegos, 35, who told of seeing an object early Sunday morning, said it "made a rumbling noise" as it took off. 
The latest report received a report from two men traveling in the same area. Satancias said that the object they saw "definitely was not an airplane, had swooped down toward trees" and then "took off rapidly toward the stars."
Although the object Gallegos saw was not that large as he first thought it to be, Vigil said there was no doubt in his mind that the officer did see something. "And the object Satancias reported was something very unusual," Vigil said.

NEW MEXICO NEWS
New Mexico's perennial addiction - flying saucers took another turn this week. The man who started it all, Socorro policeman Lonnie Zamora, says that the noise that woke him up at about 5:50 was the latest report. Was Monday. It came from La Madera, about 50 miles south of Socorro, where a passerby spotted an"aerial object" on the ground near La Madera. A Civil defense guard, James Gavin, says it glowed brightly. When he went to check it out, he told State Police he got within 200 feet of the object which was about 15 feet in diameter and 8 feet high. The object was about 6 feet off the ground near La Madera, a tiny community high in the New Mexico mountains. Zamora reported earlier that he saw an object about 15 to 20 feet in diameter about 2 feet off the ground. When he approached, it accelerated rapidly and left a strong impression in the mud near the spot. Impressions about 10 inches deep were reportedly left by the object. Although Zamora is described as a thorough, capable police officer, many are skeptical of his reported sighting.

The forecast says it should be fair through tonight, a little warmer today and tonight. The predicted high for today is 56 and the low tonight should be near 48.

Air Force Probes Policeman's Story Of 'Saucer' at Sands
SOCORRO, N.M. - April 27. (AP) - This was the reported landing place for a fly-ing "saucer" claimed to have been seen by a Socorro, N.M. policeman, Lonnie Zamora, who told how he spotted an egg-shaped object near Socorro, N.M. Zamora is described as a "very reliable witness" by the Air Force, which is investigating the incident.
SOCORRO POLICEMAN Lonnie Zamora tells how he spotted an egg-shaped flying object near Socorro, N.M. Zamora said he saw two figures near the object, which had distinctive markings, before it took off at a high rate of speed and disappeared. U.S. Air Force and military men seem inclined to believe Zamora's story.

search organization, said she believes intelligent beings from another planet made several landing in New Mexico in the past few days.
"We are convinced the Socorro policeman saw what he described," she said after her return from Socorro, where she is investigating the reported landing of a UFO near that city.
Lonnie Zamora, the policeman, said he saw something standing near the scene which he described as a strange-looking object, she said.
Mrs. Lorenzen, who is director of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, said she interviewed Zamora after he reported the incident to authorities.
"The presence here indicates that the government has admitted the existence of these craft. Having caused the landing of one of them, it becomes obligatory for the government to investigate it," she said.
Jean Shepherd, chief of the Aerial Phenomena Branch at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and Air Force investigator Sgt. David Moody were in Socorro, N.M. Tuesday to check the report. Dr. J. Allen Hynek of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, who has assisted the Air Force in investigations, was expected to arrive here today to continue the investigation.
The object came to a halt in a field near the city and appeared to land and then take off, leaving a crater in the ground, authorities said.
Adams told the officer he didn't take his car under the object, and his car stalled. The officer reported he then got out and fired at the object, he told Adams, but the firing didn't affect it. The object then rose rapidly from the ground and disappeared.
This is the latest in a series which have kept New Mexico and military authorities on the alert, ever since an unidentified flying object was reportedly sighted recently over the city.

He heard a roar and saw smoke and flames coming from underneath the object. The UFO rose to a point about 15-20 feet above the ground and then landed. He stated that the object remained stationary for several seconds and then flew off in a southerly direction, following the contour of the terrain. On several occasions he wrote Lonnie Zamora concerning his sighting and never received a reply. It was also unable to reach him by telephone. Investigators from their project office at Wright-Patterson AF Base sent investigators to Socorro to interview Lonnie Zamora and determine what the object was.

NEW SIGHTS OF SAUCERS
Strange Objects Seen by Several Persons in New Mexico

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (UPI) - In New Mexico, first site of the atomic bomb and now a space-age military bastion, citizens say they have seen, shot at and run from "flying saucers" and other unidentified flying objects.

A Rio Grande Valley policeman said he saw a strange object that hovered above his car like legs at dusk. When he went to investigate, the object zoomed away. Socorro, N.M., policeman said he ran from it.

Since then, the appearance of strange objects have caused excitement throughout New Mexico, Wyoming and into Montana in the high Rocky Mountains.

Some Explanations:
The Air Force sent its top flying saucer investigator to New Mexico to check the sightings, but he says there is no scientific or military explanation for what so many citizens have seen.

One scientist said a "Superforce" causing the strange sights may be causing radio waves and down-flying jets taking off objects up into the bright stroke lights.

The scientist, Dr. Lincoln LaPaz, Institute of Meteoritics at the University of New Mexico, said there is no danger of outer-space invasion because anyone living outside this terrestrial globe would be displaying similar sightings above our atmosphere.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek, head of the astronomy department at Northwestern University, and the Air Force's top consultant on unidentified flying objects, came to the state to investigate but some left believing the objects could not be identified.

Plenty of Radar
"It is my understanding that there are more than its share of radar installations," one officer said, "and those stations seem not to pick up anything."

While Sandia Missile Range, Holloman Air Force Base, Kirtland Air Force Base are among the many military installstions in New Mexico, officials at these radar operations say they have not recorded the flying saucers.

A Zamora, a technical sergeant at the landing site, said the craft behoves much like the object Zamora saw on a picture in the March issue of the U.S. Naval Institute proceedings.

He said the picture is several years old and the same military technicians who will examine the landing marks are familiar with it. Zamora probably is correctly identifying the craft as what he saw, Lapaz said.

APRIL 24, 1964, Socorro, New Mexico
On April 24, 1964, at approximately 5:45 P.M., New Mexico State Police, Mr. Lonnie Zamora, reported an object on the ground a mile south of town, down at the arroyo. Lonnie Zamora said the object was white, egg-shaped and supported off the ground on legs. He saw smoke and flames coming from underneath the object. The noise was similar to a roar and the object rose rapidly, accelerated and took off in a southwesterly direction. Zamora said it was about 50 feet long and about 15 feet wide.
The Air Force sent investigators from the Holloman Air Development Center. The investigation disclosed the following facts: No other witnesses to the object could be identified. There were no helicopter or aircraft in the area. Observers at radar installations observed no unusual or unidentified blips. There was no unusual meteorological activity. There were no signs of markings of any kind in the area other than the shallow depressions at the landing site. Laboratory analysis of the burned brush showed no chemical traces which would indicate a type of propellant. The Air Force continues its investigation and the case is still open.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO, 24 APRIL 1964

On April 24, 1964, a Socorro, New Mexico policeman, Mr Lonnie Zamora, reported sighting an object about 15 feet in diameter, with a shiny metallic surface, hovering above the hills and gullies and covered with markings. FOLLOWING MR ZAMORA'S REPORT, THE AIR FORCE INVESTIGATORS MADE THE FOLLOWING INVESTIGATION:

Mr Zamora reported that while chasing a speeding car north on US 85, he heard a roar and saw flames in an area where a dynamite shack was known to be located. He abandoned the chase and proceeded to where the explosion had occurred. After traveling a little-used road and experiencing considerable difficulty in trying to drive his car, he came upon a well-covered hill, he estimated that he was then about 500-600 yards from the object. At this point the object started off at a high rate of speed in a southerly direction, leaving the ground with a tremendous roar and burnt streak of flame. Mr Zamora said he saw two people whom he assumed to be the occupants of the object. This is the only time he ever said he saw these figures; he did not see them again.

It was reported to AFSCEP that he was proceeding to investigate what he believed to be an auto accident. He drove to a point about 150 yards from the spot where the object rested and stopped the car to proceed on foot. He said the object was white or egg- or bell-shaped and that he heard a roar and saw flame as it lifted off. He said that no noise other than the roar was heard.

No other witnesses to the object reported by Mr Zamora could be located. There were no unidentified helicopters or aircraft in the area. Observers at radar installations had observed no unusual or unidentified blips. There was no unusual meteorological activity; no thunderstorms. The weather was windy but clear.

The text on the page appears to be describing "County Data" related to a data-processing department in Texas. It mentions details about staffing, salaries, and ongoing issues within the department.

County Data
The county's new data-processing department, under the direction of Jerry Parks, a former employee, was made operational today by County Commissioners. Mr. Parks will oversee the data-processing department and its ordinance with the super vision of the County Judge. 
The Commissioner's office announced today that starting salary for Mr. Parks will be $600 a month. He will probably have a staff of two machine operators and three clerks. One of the first problems will involve the arrangements with the data machines which the county leases from the T.J. Watson organization of Albuquerque. The county has found that the $108.90 monthly price charged will have to be renegotiated.

Air Force UFO
Expert to Check
"Saucer" Reports

SOCORRO — Dr. J. Allen Hynek, special unidentified flying obje.?ct consultant to the Air Force, arrived here' Tuesday night to begin his investigation of the Socorro policeman's report that he saw a mysterious flying object land and take off again.

Dr. Hynek said he hoped to talk to the policeman, Lonnie Zamora, and to return to the site where Zamora said he saw the object land Tuesday morning.

Zamora, a policeman, reported that at 5:45 p.m. Tuesday he saw a flame on the ground and an object described at an egg-shape, about 12 to 15 feet long, on the desert floor. He said as he approached, the object rose rapidly and flew off.

Dr. Hynek said he would visit the Socorro Observatory and the adjoining Langmuir Laboratory, where a new telescope, the largest in the world, was being installed when the incident occurred at Espanola, where it was reportedly spotted, as a follow-up to the investigation.

Hynek said the findings of the probe would be turned over to the Air Force. Meanwhile, the investigation was being conducted by the office of the Aerial Phenomena Branch of the Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.

Sgt. David Moody of the base already was in Socorro, joining in the investigation with Dr. Hynek.

The report was another in a series which have kept New Mexico and military authorities busy since Zamora's original report Friday. The reports continue to come from points following a line from south of Espanola.

Implications have been hinted at involving the director of the "Aerial Phenomena" Branch of the Air Force, but officials said today they knew of no such implications.

"TIM REALLY SURPRISED
"I never expected to see anything like that," she said. "It was the most unusual thing I've ever seen in New Mexico. But I didn't panic. It would just like a plate would spin if you threw it into the air and it floated, but it had a bright light."

"Several small planes were in the air at the time of MRS. Sauceri's sighting, but she said the object she saw was not an airplane."

"HYNEK WAS in Socorro yesterday to talk to Socorro policeman Lonnie Zamora who started it all when he said he saw a strange craft land and take off again last Friday."

"Zamora said the object stood still for a while, then rose up and took off swiftly when he approached the object. It seemed to give off a reddish glow."

"Hynek said Zamora is a "level-headed officer" whose report he considers to be serious. But he said, 'He saw something. But does not know what it is.'"

"JIM NAVARRO, an employe at the port of entry in Anthony, New Mexico - Texas, said he saw the object the past two nights."  

"He said it seemed to remain still for a long time, then took off like a fast race car. Navarro said when it took off, it appeared to change size."

"A state policeman said he heard reports from the Air Force that two officers had been dispatched to the area."

"REPORTS from Hobbs and Hatch said many had seen the same object." 

"The Air Force said low-flying jets have been taking pictures day and night in the Albuquerque area and went to Kingman, Ariz. and from Deming west to Casa Grande, Ariz."

"These planes use bright strobe lights that flash off and on, lighting a large area for picture taking."

USA UNDERGOES UFO AVALANCHE!
According to press dispatches from western sources, a wave of UFO activity of unprecedented magnitude has been in progress in August, as this is being written. Sightings, encounters, and "landings" have been reported from the Western U.S., the Ohio Valley, and the Pennsylvania-New Jersey region.

A number of newspaper clippings dealing with UFO sightings were enclosed. These enable us to confirm the major sightings and reports originating in the areas mentioned above.

Soccoro (sic) (New Mexico) Police Chief Zamora spotted an egg-shaped metallic object descending and landing near a remote area of the city, according to New Mexico press reports.

Right next to the object were two figures, rather small in size. One of the figures turned and apparently saw him. We will not release the exact details on this sighting, as the observer's identity must be protected. More than 50 newsmen descended on the location shortly after the Soccoro (sic) sighting, more landing in Soccoro (sic) than have ever been known to cover such an incident there before.

However, full coverage to all '64 sightings will be given in subsequent issues, through our own researchers' detailed reports.

Santa Fean Reports
Seeing UFO Landed
North of Espanola

An unidentified flying object was reported to have landed and taken off near La Madera, north of Espanola, New Mexico.

The evidence that Orlando Gallegos of Santa Fe reported was that he and his family went to visit his father, just north of Espanola, on Sunday, arriving about 1:30 a.m. 

Gallegos later told state police he saw the object sitting on the ground in an arroyo area when he arrived. He did not approach closer than 500 feet. He reported a luminous egg-shaped object about 40 feet long and 12 feet wide. He said it rose straight up and disappeared to the west. Some of the evidence is missing and take-off seems to have been via shallow holes where the object apparently landed on its landing gear and scared clumps of grass and there were two round, very shallow depressions found.

What appears to be evidence of an unidentified object landing and taking off at Socorro has been observed, a highly reliable source, as can be gathered from the evidence of a secondary nature and testimony. In Socorro, State Police Sgt. Sam Chavez told of an unidentified flying object which landed in a quarry late last Friday. The object was reported by two people who reported what they saw to Chavez. Near the center foreground and burned greasewood and charred pieces. The object was later trampeled on by curiosity seekers when the photo was taken.

The image does not contain a photograph. Instead, it appears to be a scanned page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

At least one other person called a to view the object. This was Opal Grinder, manager of a White Sands Proving Ground Service Station situated about 12 miles northeast of the station and remarked that several UFOs flew around here previously. "The tourist said what she saw was just a hopping helicopter. If that's what it was, the man said, holding on to his car. It actually was a stranger who came out of the desert and landed moments later. The tourists commented that he appeared to be searching for something. This was Zamora's car. Grinder did not know of the significance of the incident."

A woman from Tucson, Ariz. couple was a passenger to interview Zamora. The woman said a rain had occurred. She and the other persons in the car all saw the object hovering for two hours at an estimated altitude of 400 feet. It was reported the observers had seen a man on the "edge" of the object.

Capt. Richard T. Holder of Socorro, U.S. Army, Headquarters Battery, Stallion Range Center on White Sands Missile Range, said Zamora had notified him directly of the incident on the evenings of April 24 by local civilians who asked to provide assistance with a reported situation. I attempted to determine whether White Sands Missile Range Headquarters had anything that might indicate the conditions described.

An inspection of the scene Saturday morning showed the object had landed astride a narrow, rock-strewn draw with the officers earlier had circled with stones the four places where the legs of the object had touched. The object was about a foot long by six inches wide. They did not appear to have been made by an object striking the earth with a tremendous weight or considerable velocity, but by an object of considerable weight setting down lightly. The two legs of the object that Zamora saw probably were about 2.5 feet long.
It was about 12 feet from one impression on the west side and 13 feet between the two on the east side. The width was probably nine or more feet. The clumps of green grass and two greasewood bushes seemed to have been crushed all at once by an extremely hot flame. There were fragments of green branches on one greasewood branch and on the two crushed depressions were four and five inches in diameter, respectively. The cause of the landing of the object, like its identity and its source, remains unanswered. As no further evidence was found, after Capt. Holder was apprised of the UFO occurrence, he made a report of it to the proper agencies at WSAM. Investigation of the incident will be conducted by it and by designated government agencies.

WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. MAY 13 (AP)-THE FIERY EXPLOSION OF A LITTLE JOE LII ROCKET OCCURRED EARLY MORNING CALM TODAY. IT WAS THE FIRST TEST OF THE APOLLO MOON SPACECRAFT LAUNCH ESCAPE SYSTEM. EARLY INDICATIONS FROM NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WERE THAT THE TEST, OR THE APOLLO ESCAPE SYSTEM, WAS SUCCESSFUL. IT HAD BEEN DELAYED 24 HOURS BECAUSE OF WINDS A DUST STORM YESTERDAY.
A LITTLE JOE LII BLASTED INTO THE SKY ABOUT 6 A.M. (MST) FROM A CLOUD OF DUST CAUSED BY THE ROCKET'S SEVEN SOLID FUEL ENGINES, GENERATING MORE THAN 300,000 POUNDS OF THRUST. CLIMBING AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 30 SECONDS, THE 35-FOOT TALL VEHICLE STACKED WITH BOILERPLATE MODELS OF THE APOLLO COMMAND AND SERVICE MODULES, REACHED A MAXIMUM AERODYNAMIC STRESS PERIOD AT THE CLIMAXED 73 SECONDS OF GROUND SIGNAL. AT THE SAME INSTANT, EXPLOSIVE BOLTS SEPARATED THE COMMAND MODULE FROM THE DISINTEGRATING ROCKET AND THE 135,000-POUND THRUST ESCAPE ROCKET CARRIED THE COMMAND MODULE ABOUT 4,000 FEET HIGHER, SAFELY AWAY FROM THE EXPLOSION. 
THE COMMAND MODULE, WHICH WILL CARRY ASTRONAUTS TO THE MOON, SEPARATED FROM THE ESCAPE TOWER. ABOUT 3 MILES SUSPENDED BY PARACHUTES, FLOATED TO THE DESERT FLOOR ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM THE LAUNCH SITE.
A NASA SPOKESMAN SAID THE ONLY APPARENT TROUBLE WAS THAT ONE OF THE THREE 38-FOOT DIAMETER RING PARACHUTES ATTACHED TO THE COMMAND MODULE BROKE AWAY FROM THE CAPSULE SOON AFTER THEY OPENED AT 7,850 FEET ALTITUDE. EARLIER, NASA OFFICIALS HAD SAID TWO PARACHUTES COULD BRING THE CAPSULE DOWN SAFELY.

UFO Sighting, Socorro, New Mexico, 24 Apr 64
Hq USAF SAVOY PB (Mrs Geiser)
CASE D c 23330

The following is a resume on the unidentified flying object sighted by Mr Lonnie Zamora, of Socorro, New Mexico on 24 Apr 64. Results of the investigation so far, conclusions reached by ATIC, and courses of action in continuing the investigation.

Background Information:
At approximately 5:45 PM on 24 Apr 64, an unidentified flying object was observed by Mr Lonnie Zamora in Socorro, New Mexico. The object sighted by Mr Zamora had left distinctive markings on the ground at the scene. Investigation by the New Mexico State Police. The object sighted by Mr Zamora had landed briefly in a desert area and then took off, leaving markings on the ground.

The area was secured by Sgt Chavez and the Commanding Officer of the N.M. State Police, who made notes of the physical evidence and measurements of the ground markings, and ordered an initial investigation of the sighting.

Evaluation:
(a) Septs 8:44 1944 (o) were made and several local news reports of the sighting had become quite disturbed with the amount of publicity and reports of little green men and descriptions of the object.

The account of the sighting given by Mr Zamora is the most reliable. Albuquerque Journal, 27 April 1964 and comments by USAF representatives indicates that Mr Zamora, a 52-year old senior patrolman, is a completely reliable and credible witness. The officers at the scene, according to Maj David Moody, were very impressed with Zamora's sincerity and thoroughness.  

Results of Capt Holder's investigation were received. Interviews with Sgt Chavez and other officers concerned with the initial investigation revealed that the sighting was legitimate and there was no indication that the object was being perpetrated.

The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings. The text on the page appears to be a report detailing the findings from the investigation of a UFO sighting that occurred on April 24, 1964 in Socorro, New Mexico.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed using optical character recognition (OCR):

UFO sighting. The data was collected and no positive conclusion
reached. The sighting was reported to Capt. Holder by Sgt. Searcy. Capt. Holder, then the officer designated, depicts the true circumstances of the sighting.

a. Specific Findings from Efforts to Date:
(1) On the morning of 24 April, 1964 Capt. Holder of the
New Mexico State Police was notified by a resident of Socorro,
N.M. that an unidentified object had been sighted approximately 5 miles
S.W. of Socorro. Capt. Holder responded and found the physical
impressions at the site as described by the witnesses. There were no automobile tire markings or markings of any sort in the area other than the alleged landing and as noted in Capt. Holder's report.

(2) Radioactivity: Major Conner and Sgt. Moody checked the area thoroughly and found no significant radioactivity in the area of the sighting.

(3) No activity was observed in the area. The site was examined carefully by Capt. Holder who talked with the pilot and operational personnel who arrived shortly after the sighting. See very brief notes on the time of the sighting.

(4) The physical impressions in the soil were excavated on 19 May 64. Examination of the soil was completed on 19 May 64.
Laboratory analysis of the soil was completed that there was no
foreign material in the soil samples. Also, no significant
difference in element concentration between the soil samples and
control samples was detected. There was no significant difference in elemental concentration between the different samples.

SUBJECT: Lunar Module Spacecraft Landing Gear

Gentlemen:

This is to confirm our recent telephone conversation with regard to your letter of May 20, 1964 in which you ask for information relative to our experience in this particular field. We believe a review of the enclosed booklets will indicate to you that we do have considerable background in this field.

We have submitted proposals to the Martin Company, Baltimore, Maryland, and also Grumman in Bethpage, Long Island. These were classified proposals, details of which are possibly available to you at Wright Field.

Our Instrumentation and Control Division in Grand Rapids received a contract (AF 33(615) 972) several years ago covering a study of "Vehicle Departure and Alignment Concepts". Again, we may we suggest that the complete file on this subject is available to you at Wright Field. For your convenient reference, we attach copies of reports 1, 3, 4, 5, 14, and 15 covering this particular study. These are probably the most graphic reports submitted against the contract, and will serve to show you the numerous areas of study.

Our National Water Lift Division in Kalamazoo, Michigan, produced the landing gear assembly for the "surveyor" project. A copy of a single page brochure on this topic is enclosed.

We do not feel free to pass on further information on this program because of the restrictions imposed by the prime contractor, Hughes Aircraft Company. Additional information on this project may be in your files or available to you by contacting the Hughes Company.

If it would be of any assistance to you in your present project, we would be pleased to have one of our preliminary design engineers visit you for general technical discussions on "lunar landing gear". If you would prefer to visit us, we would be certainly glad to have you spend a day or two with us. These suggestions, of course, do not place you or the Government under any obligation to us whatsoever.

The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a surveyor landing gear or shock absorber, based on the description provided in the text. The text describes the technical specifications and design parameters of this component, which is called the "Surveyor Landing Gear" and is produced by the Pneumodynamics Corp. National Water Lift Division.

SURVEYOR LANDING GEAR
Project Surveyor is a scientific task with the end requirement of successfully accomplishing a landing on the moon. The design parameters are very severe. Temperatures range from 275°F to -260°F, and pressures inside the unit are 2,500 psi, and pressures outside the unit drop to 10-12 torr.
The unit contains a gas charge at 1500 psi and will retain such a charge for 12 months. External moving parts are encapsulated by flexible metal bellows. The unit uses a special grade of titanium (13 Cr 11V 3 Al) heat treated to 185,000 psi minimum, very detailed and compressive reliability program controls.
By the nature of its' end usage, the production of the shock absorber will be small. However, the engineering, product know-how, and special experience requirements are very large. This unit typifies NWL Company's capacity for small production runs on sophisticated hardware.

Project Surveyor is a scientific task with the end requirement of successfully accomplishing a landing on the moon. The lunar vehicle landings on the moon is incorporated in each leg to dissipate some of the touchdown energy and to store the balance. NWL is responsible for the design, production, and testing of this unit which was originally initiated in 1959.

The design parameters are very severe. Temperatures range from + 275 F to - 300 F, pressures inside the unit is up to 15,000 psi, and pressures outside the unit drop to 10-14 torr. The required damping profile is both a function of unit velocity and unit stroke position.

The unit contains a gas charge at 1500 psi and will retain such a charge for 12 months. External mounting parts are encapsulated by flexible metal bellows. The unit uses a special grade of titanium (13 CR 11V 3 AL) heat treated to 185,000 psi minimum. A very detailed and comprehensive reliability program controls this product. 

By the nature of its' end usage, the production of the shock absorbers will be small. However, the engineering, product know-how, and special experience requirement are very large. This unit typifies NWL Company's capacity for small production runs on sophisticated hardware.

The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It is a scanned page from a document, which seems to be a report or investigation of a UFO incident that occurred in Socorro, New Mexico in 1964.

Transcription of the text:

(6) VTOL and Inertia Modules:

Personnel working on the development of VTOL type aircraft and lunar modules were consulted. VTOL experience has shown that the utilization of certain types of ducted blast devices which would divert the force of the blast downwards. However, they were not experts in the craft of this nature. 

(c) Opinions and Recommendations:

The reactions encountered before not only on the development of the object but also on the circumstances of the sighting at Socorro. One known experimental model, constructed by Bell Aircraft Corporation for the Air Force, does not fit the description. 

(7) Additional Witness:

The U.S. Defense and Civilian authorities of the city of Apo r carried an article indicating that an unidentified object resembling a UFO was sighted around 5:45 p.m. on the DPI just a few minutes before the Socorro sighting. It is noteworthy that this was the first time the spot where the UFO landed. If this is the case, the only correlation of white sand's burn was also seen from that direction. A telephone call to Mr. Casil, the Director of the National Scientific Research Agency, indicated that he was aware of the case and that an unidentified tourist had observed the information. 

(8) Conclusions:

The investigation of the data contained in the various investigations of the case, a definite conclusion cannot be arrived at present. The object sighted, according to the eyewitnesses, appears to be of the VTOL type of aircraft or object. The state-of-the-art and the sighting cannot be attributed to a state-of-the-art phenomenon. I can categorically state that the vehicle or object observed by Dr. Lonnie Zamora was not an inter-planetary space vehicle visiting the planet Earth. This case is still open and the investigation is still in progress.

LANDING ON MARS - Leaving scientific equip ment behind, the science-fiction spacecraft draws up to be ship which is stationed above Mars' atmosphere.
The journey by a U.S. space team could be made by 1975, according to Dr. Franklin P. Dixon, former director, Aeronutronic Division of the Philco Corp.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document, which contains text discussing a potential US space team mission to Mars in 1975.

U.S. SPACE TEAM COULD BLAST OFF FOR MARS IN 1975, SCIENTIST SAYS

- A NASA-run three-man U.S. space team could be successfully landed on Mars in 1975, according to Dr. Wernher von Braun, director of the Marshall Space Flight Division of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, and director of the Saturn program.

- The target date could be as early as 1975 - if government officials give the project the go-ahead at this time, he said.

- Von Braun said the landing would provide much of the testing and assembling the hardware and three-year training program needed to land men safely on Mars.

- Dr. Dixon said the only additional work needed beyond current space studies would be the final development of a larger propellant spacecraft, a mother ship from an earth-orbiting space station and atmospheric conditions. 

- The major hurdle is to have the government want to make the trip.

- The Russians say they expect to make the round trip.

- The mother-ship would establish a Martian orbit and send out the actual landing vehicle.

- The flight would last about one hour.

- The capsule or craft described would be able to change directions to make corrections from the prime launch pattern. It would be a small craft and not the large one used for the blast-off.

- Most of the equipment in the landing craft would be expendable once it has served its specific purpose, Dr. Dixon said.

NARRATIVE OF SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO SIGHTING, 24 APRIL 1964

Shortly after 5:50 PM on Friday, 24 April 1964, Sgt Lonnie Zamora of the Socorro Police Department was in pursuit of a speeding vehicle. As he was chasing the vehicle, he observed a flame in the sky to the southwest. He saw a shiny object which appeared to him to be an egg-shaped craft resting on the ground, with two people standing near it. As he approached closer, he thought an explosion had occurred. In order to reach this spot, he turned off the paved road onto a rough and hilly area. After two or three efforts to drive his car up to the object, he finally abandoned his pursuit of the speeding vehicle and drove toward the area where he had seen the object. 

The object was described as being about 20 ft long and about 6-7 ft high. It was a shiny metallic object which had a reddish-orange type glow under it. Two persons were observed near the object, but no others were seen in the area. Sgt Zamora stated the two persons appeared to be normal size and were moving towards the object as if preparing to enter it. 

As Sgt Zamora approached to within about 50 ft of the object, it rose vertically with a tremendous roar, and as it began to gain altitude, a bluish-orange flame came from under it. The object immediately began to gain considerable speed and altitude. Sgt Zamora stated the flame was very intense and blinding and as the object rose, it made a rather loud roar that gradually faded as the object disappeared in the distance.

While proceeding to the location where the object was assumed to have landed, the State Police and his call was monitored by Sgt Chavez of the New Mexico State Police. Sgt Zamora attempted to search the area but was unable to find any physical evidence other than an area of crushed brush which he referred to as the "landing area".

As per your request, I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

Sgt Chavez set out to the location while he was driving toward the object. Sgt Chavez took the wrong road, and was in fact heading in the opposite direction from where the object was located. Sgt Chavez said he wasted about 15 minutes before he realized he was going the wrong way. The object was parked about 800 yards from the point where Sgt Chavez turned around. Sgt Chavez was skeptical of the situation and discounted the fact that he had witnessed the object. He said he was tired and hungry, and that the object was gone by the time he arrived at the location. There were no other witnesses, and Sgt Chavez was the only one who had been in position to see the object. Sgt Chavez estimated the area and said it covered approximately 15 feet. He was convinced in his own mind that he had seen an object while investigating the sighting.

Memo, from Capt Quintanilla, 27 April 1964

TO: Colonel de Jonckheere

At 0715, 24 April, when I reported for duty as SAO, I was informed by Major Swalman of the Air Force that he had received a UFO report via the telephone at 2130 EST, 24 April, from the 1005th Special Investigation Squadron at Holloman AFB, New Mexico. Lt Col Kline had reported to them that while driving 14 miles south of Socorro, New Mexico, a patrolman of the New Mexico State Police had observed a landed UFO and the object took off and disappeared to the west. The witness claims that he saw a small humanlike object approximately 5 feet tall, wearing what appeared to be a white coverall suit. The object was first observed at about 5'5" height, but when it went to enter the craft, it appeared to levitate to the craft's opening which was about 12 feet from the ground. The craft itself was about 40 feet in diameter and 12 to 15 feet high, oval in shape and had a gray metallic color. The witness stated that the craft made no sound and after a short time it rose vertically with a "tremendous" wind which nearly knocked the witness to the ground. The craft then accelerated horizontally and disappeared rapidly. The witness claimed to have seen the object hovering and then the object took off with tremendous speed.

At 0930, 24 April, Col Cole from the Air Force BLUE BOOK section and Col Holder from the Inspection Division arrived at Holloman AFB to get all the details on this report. At 0930, 25 April, Col Harris from the Emergency Action Group - JCS Communications Center went to Socorro and interviewed the witness at his residence. At 1120, 25 April, the Socorro State Police arrived at the scene, took plaster casts of the alleged landing impressions which were found to measure 5'5" in diameter and up to 1 1/2 inches deep. Soil samples were taken and will be analyzed. At 1123, the Socorro State Police secured the area and restricted access. 

At 2135, 26 April, Capt Holder, Col Kline and myself had a conference with Col Harris and Major O'Connor. We were advised that Sgt Moody is presently on TDY at Kirkland on Project Cloud Gap regarding UFO incidents, and we were further advised to get in touch with Capt Holder from White Sands, who had interviewed the witness and obtained his complete statement.

Sgt. Chaves of the New Mexico State Police was interviewed by Major Conner and Sgt. Moody. He could add little to the investigation except that he arrived at the scene about three minutes after the incident happened and that Mr. Zamora was scared.

Major Conner's formal report will be on its way on 27 April. He will include copies of Sgt. Chaves' report, and Sgt. Moody's report, which will be forwarded at a later date.

As the present time we don't know what it was, but Major Conner and Sgt. Moody are still checking out the helicopter activity in the area.

There was a call to Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, USAF BLUE BOOK, and Lt. W. Branch.

Summary of UFO Report received by phone on 25 April 1964:

Caller: Captain Theodore W. Cany, 1005th Special Investigation Group, Wash.
Called at 21:30 EST, 25 April
Call received by OD (Maj K S Samshing*)
UFO data was received by Capt Cany from Lt Col King, Counter Intelligence Division, Albuquerque, New Mexico, who in turn read about it in the local newspaper and also was provided data by the FBI.
The alleged UFO sighting took place at about 1800 MST on 24 April. The object allegedly was witnessed in a rural area on the Stallion Range, Socorro, New Mexico.
The alleged witness was a reputable local police officer by the name of Lonnie Zamora. Zamora was chasing a speeding motorist when he saw the object from the road at a distance of about 200 feet. He claims to have seen two men in white coveralls get into the silver colored football shaped object, about 15 feet long. The vehicle allegedly took off with a roar and an altitude of 20 feet and disappeared rapidly to the west.
Upon investigation of this, the Army (a Captain R.T. Holder of White Sands) reportedly took off the area. Also, the FBI at Albuquerque proceeded to the area and allegedly confirmed that "something" had been there. They reportedly found 1"x5" impressions in the ground somewhat like hand impressions, and the impressions appeared to be burned-black. The newspaper stated that the Army took soil samples.
The above is all Capt Cany could report.
It is surmised that Lt Col King, Albuquerque 268-2107 be contacted for proper questioning of Lonnie Zamora.

M/R: On 18 May 1964 Sgt Moody called Mr Opal Grinder at 835-9916 in Socorro New Mexico regarding the article appearing in the Socorro Chieftain Newspaper & witness fighting. Mr Grinder manages the Whiting Brothers Service Station. He could give no information other than their newspaper article. He did not receive any calls telling them to fabricate stories or ignore the case. Police were called & interviewed the witness say the object came from the East over the highway and had remarked about the low altitude and odd appearance of the craft.
He will be on the look out in case the witness returns to Socorro.

IN REPLY REFER TO:
CC-12/bjk
20 May 1964

Captain Hector Quintanilla Jr.
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
Headquarters Foreign Technology Division
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Captain Quintanilla,

Reference is made to my phone call this morning. I have talked to Major Casper who was the Cloud Gap Special Operations Officer at Albuquerque, based at Kirtland AFB, during the time this incident took place. Cloud Gap operations were conducted in an area about a hundred miles north of Socorro, New Mexico. Cloud Gap personnel did not have any information for special lighting which would possibly have led to the description provided by police officer Lonnie Zamora.

Since certain aerial surveillance flights were being conducted by Navy aircraft, IA 50's, in the area in question, a check on such flights revealed none were flown on 24 April 1964 in connection with Cloud Gap.

We have no information on this sighting other than that provided by your SGT MOODY who was a participant on our project and that picked up from the newspapers.

I have enclosed an article found in the Los Angeles Times of 20 May which may be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

KENNETH A. YOUNG
Colonel, USAF

29 April 1955

Dr. Donald Menzel 
Mrs. Lyle Boyd
Harvard College Observatory
Cambridge 38, Massachusetts

Dear Don and Lyle:

At long last I am prepared to make a reply to your letter of February 29. I'm also enclosing a piece of the identical type of cardboard originally placed by my laboratory assistant under the Ubatuba charred fragments when they were received. I remarked at that time that the original piece had charred edges which my or may not have had any connection with the slugged landing at Socorro. This sort of cardboard gets caught under the husks in the wind you see, and you not only see them on the ground, but reports of them continue to turn up all over the country. Old Spanish cardboard boxes, formerly used for food, etc., seem to be the source. 

Again, more and more, I would judge. This cardboard, as you can see, bears evidence of having been used to take a model of a spaceship.

I should mention that I discussed this whole matter with major general jr. childers and he informed me that he is still satisfied that the report on this case from Socorro is accurate. He says that all parties concerned in that investigation are still convinced that the events as reported are accurate. He informs me that the movie film obtained at that time is still under study. The movie is due to have a world premiere in Socorro, and I'm hopeful it will reveal something of importance.

I don't think we can say too much about the flames which could have been interpreted as a flame. As you know, a burning bush, etc., I couldn't get anyone to agree to my suspicions as to this being the explanation. Caves instead show only the fact that a burning body had occurred. But the Caves said that their flame had seemed to be ordinary flame until it began to diminish. As they had no explosives or anything that would account for an ordinary flame, they couldn't say that it was anything more than was exposed to ordinary vision. I'm afraid we must go to other major points.

- page 96 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing only text.

The hoax hypothesis is, of course, one that suggests itself immediately. It is Quintanilla's and my opinion that both Chavez and FBI agent Byrnes must have been on the lost hypnosis. They testified that there were no tracks in the immediate neighborhood and that the object must have landed and taken off rapidly. If it had landed, there would have been tracks around if the pranksters had not beat a hasty retreat. These gentlemen said that the wind was blowing strongly from the south, yet the object was reported to rise in a direction opposite to the wind. Of course, the directions are wrong. I questioned and requested the people on this point and couldn't make them change their story.

The Pranksters could have hidden behind the knoll directly to the south, particularly as they had down arrows. The dynamite shock is too small and too far away for such a large object. Oral Grinder, a high-school student working for him, and I talked with his stepbrother particularly, and it was added that they hate all "Hams" and that it "was intended to get even with them somehow; they would do anything more direct, like letting the air out of his tires or something with immediate retrieval, rather than a distant act that would be difficult to trace, like the dynamite."

The dynamite shock does not stand up to legs as I have inspected it closely, and there is no photograph distinct.

Furthermore, I doubt very much whether a hoax could have been long going. If a box comes off well, pranksters like to close a bit, and there would have been no photo others even with Zapruder if they couldn't have gotten some inside out of it. It was once told to me of an instance in which some college students wanted to get even with a geology professor so they planted "fossils" and contrived an explosion at some distant part of the state, and had this poor professor running around trying to keep their secret. They "confided" to friends who in turn confided to others, and there wasn't any professor who couldn't keep their secret. They "confided" to friends who in turn confided to others, and there wasn't any professor who couldn't keep their secret. They "confided" to others.

OCR text output:

But realizing all that aside, the things that would seem to indicate sightings a hoax are the fact that no tracks coming to or going from the region were found, again within minutes. Objects and the FBI agent would have to have been placed, perhaps ropes, launching equipment, gas and perhaps a vehicle which would have been difficult to dispose of in a hurry and would have easily been planned to come off as a hoax.

You suggest that when known objects are mistaken for the real, the hoaxers are intrigued and see this as a chance to try and prove their point. I believe this has been the case quite frequently, but I do not believe it was the case here. It would not seem likely to me that a hoax of this magnitude would have been planned to take advantage of a mistake of identification. There simply would not have been time to set up what would have had to have been an elaborate ruse such as this.

By the way, there is no local UFO club. The UFO sightings had no more apparent pattern or evidence than has been evident in many other cases of this type. I cannot recommend to a man that he hold up his ridicule for having "seen things".

I continue also to be persistent that whatever it is thoroughly puzzling to me, I cannot recommend a man who in good faith wants to report something that he honestly doesn't understand to be ridiculed, criticized and even made to feel he is somehow a fool who has been taken in by a hoax.... I honestly don't think a small town patrolman could have manufactured a hoax of this sophistication and scale. Such efforts would have required far more organization, equipment and personnel than would reasonably have been available for such a rash and impulsive act.

Text from the document:

It seems much more likely to me that he saw a strange craft which is BEING REPORTED. The first sighting and the landing in Socorro if it is so much secret why would anyone be landing a half mile south of a town - why also have we been unable to identify those who supposedly saw it. The year 1964 had fifteen other unidentified cases besides Zamora's. I investigated two others, one a very interesting incident which occurred to two grandsons of a friend. The University of Wisconsin along with their mother-in-law and their kid sister. They were "buzzing" by some strange craft after their car which seemed to be controlled by something that was above or behind them. They had a similar array of lights hover in a wheat field by the side of the road.

There is no question that a mighty folklore is being built up in this whole field. Someone who might be worthwhile to document all this for the benefit of historians would find it bountiful. However, I have observed the difficulty some reporters have in writing up simple happenings. They seem to be much better at generalizations, but be that as it may, the people who believe in flying saucers are generally consistent. This is Hynek's advice no. 1 and it is full of holes as Swiss cheese, but it seems thoroughly disliked in their thinking that Unidentified Flying Objects don't need any proof as existence and generally, do a much better job at "evaluating" reports than the average run-of-the-mill scientist who just don't seem to need any proof whatever so long as he can make a cheap thrill out of vilifying the Air Force and in "real-whittling" each other.

On the other hand, the activity or UFO's that I have come across are essentially negative in character. Essentially even though they have had an experience that they can't understand, and are extremely anxious about it, then it is not very credible to them, one gathers, that they wish the whole thing hadn't happened. They are much more likely to tell one another "I saw a light" than they are to tell the outsider. Therefore, it may be that they will be able to open up about their experiences and generally, be of help to those of us who are trying to do a job on determining the nature of the phenomenon that even Johns and generals have been lost to unless their having reported their experiences.

It is reportable such a study was constitute the phenomenon to which a great many observers attention should be given. It is easy to divide the area of inquiry, following different criteria, and probably to come up with something very puzzling. I think we have some sort of social obligation to do as good a job as we can do in these series of "unidentified" down the years, if regard is to be their place on the continent. Something, yet positive, may be able to (if we are given the opportunity) come up with answers that would stand up in court, but if we still accompany the results of a wide survey in this research, the Air Force is no (primarily) a scientific organization, and its concern in these is more or less for security reasons.

- page 99 -

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this scanned document. The image shows a page of text from what appears to be a Project Blue Book UFO report.

As per the OCR request, the text of the document is as follows:

"At the present time, I fail to determine whether the UFO reports contain any hostil elements. If they do not, it is not in the Air Force charter, so to speak, to conduct lengthy investigations as to the nature of the stimuli that gave rise to the reports.

Of course, I have come to regard the subject of UFOs as rather nebulous, and in many instances the conclusions reached by the Air Force after investigation have left me unconvinced. When investigations have failed to turn up positive identifications and, of course, when no time can then be given as I discover they are not on the radar scope, I am inclinded to agree the reports may be more imaginary than real.

Such reports come, however, from University of Wisconsin professors who I know live in a practical sort of state of being that young academesians do not much realize, and from small town people who are not the gullible sort but who I have found are quite capable of seeing the unusual hi-ri. They are people who seem quite normal, and I have no reason to disbeliet them or to assume they are deliberately manufacturing stories. What I cannot understand is why, if their observations are so factual, they do not provide more detailed and accurate first-hand information.

Whenever sighting reports come to my attention I always make an effort to check them out with authorities in the area. Very often no traces are found, no radar returns, no witnesses other than the original observers. Yet some of these reports seem to have better substance and leave me wondering. I guess I would be hard put to justify the expenditure of taxpayer money on very intensive investigations of sighting reports, but it seems to me the taxpayers would be just as well enlightened to know that no reliance can be placed upon witnesses and no conclusion can be drawn. Here, I lightheartedly wonder if it wouldn't be better to so report.

I feel that it would not be wise to disregard the possibility that some of these reports may contain information of scientific value and merit deeper study. But I am personally wary of encouraging anything that smacks of a "flying saucer" hysteria or the development of a field of "pseudo-science" that, in the main, seems to be of doubtful validity. Therefore I would rather see a continuing, but cautious, investigatory effort marked by restraint and objectivity.

Vawter's report on the Socorro sighting is scheduled to be published June 15. I understand he considers the Socorro incident to be the strongest evidence for the existence of UFOs that has so far come to light, and he will suggest that UFOs be given increased scientific attention. However, I am hesitant to endorse any suggestion that UFOs be given increased scientific attention because I am not fully convinced that such study would be rewarding. I would rather see the funds and effort devoted to more fruitful fields of endeavor.

Continues lack of Socorro support. I wouldn't have any more help. Both Quintanilla and I find it impossible to dismiss it as a hoax unless we have some evidence that it was a hoax. I feel that it was a real sighting. Perhaps this fact must sink in sooner or later. I keep in touch with some civilians of Socorro and a considerable length of time. Perhaps this is our best means of attacking this particular problem. I do to visit Socorro again shortly."

Report on the Trip to Socorro - Albuquerque - Socorro, March 12-13, 1965

Left Las Cruces 7:45 A.M., Friday, March 12. Arrived Socorro 10:30 A.M. and had an immediate conference with Mr. Ray Fowler, Editor of the El Defensor Chieftain, the Socorro newspaper. Our first subject was the movie that had been made by the Empire Films whose address in Hollywood is 7717 Sunset Blvd. A name connected with it is Merry Melinn's phone number is AC 213, 876-6800. Walkin is coming back to Socorro in a few weeks to arrange for the world premiere of the UFO movie in Socorro. 

This will be a white tie affair probably? Do you think the Air Force official consultant should be present at this world premiere? He does not think so. It would be exciting, but it would also give needless significance and importance to the picture. I think we had at best ignore it.

However, I learned through the grapevine that the picture is to have a Washington, D.C. preview in about three or four weeks and that Senator Symington is interested in it. We had better get Mason Jacks office, or whoever is running the show now on to this if at all possible. That is one preview that I should attend if at all possible. The scuttlebutt picture has it that the picture contains movies taken in Milan, Italy of a UFO landing with a little man getting out of it. Their rumor has it that the Empire Film Studies paid $40,000 for that Milan, Italy filmstrip. Apparently they have sunk quite a bit of money into this picture and expect to have it shown in many movie houses throughout the country and then shortly thereafter to release it for TV use. The film runs 85 minutes.

I found the situation in Socorro largely unchanged. Zamora is still generally believed, but the current feeling seems to be that there is no question but that he saw something real, but that it was most likely a super-secret device being tested. I was asked many times whether I was really sure that the U.S. government didn't have a super secret project. I pointed out that if this were the case, that it would be unlikely that we would be testing it.

There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this page from the old UFO report document. The page contains only text describing various discussions and events related to the Socorro, New Mexico UFO case.

As per your request, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

it on a global basis.and the UFO phenomenon,apart from the Socorro case,is certainly not limited to the United States.

After these discussions in the editorial offices, Rair and I went out for lunch and asked Sgt. Chaves to join us. While we were waiting for him, I showed Rair the letter from Menzel and his comments about part of it were, "Childish." But we went over it point by point, and likewise Chaves did. Chaves seemed reaction to the letter was rather strange. He had sort of a resigned, almost pathetic look on his face and said, "I really feel sorry for Lonnie. He's had to take an awful lot."

When he told of a recent case where Zamora was arresting a kid for speeding, and the kid said, "What do you want to give me a ticket for? Don't you know a flying saucer might come right down on us now?" (or something like that.)

I asked him what the whole movie situation had been. Zamora and how it had affected him. He said that Zamora had not wanted to be in the picture, but it was at the Mayor's insistence, via his boss, that he consented to do so. I can't quite believe this myself. When I talked to Zamora later, he seemed to be reasonably pleased about being in the movie. Clearly, with a world premiere in Socorro, it would be a strange human who did not get some kick out of a thing like that.

I will come back to the Menzel letter later because I discussed it with DR. La Paz who knows Menzel well, that was the purpose of my going to Albuquerque. I purchased five newspapers which had various stories about the movie or about related matters. The papers were for Tuesday, February 9; Thursday, February 25; Tuesday March 2; Tuesday, March 9; and Thursday, March 11. The first one I think you have; it states, "Socorro Part of Film on UFO's Completed; Zamora's Account Jives With Sixteen Verified Sightings." The February 25th issue contains a front page story on a UFO sighted over Gallup which far as I can see, is nothing more than a meteor. The March 2nd issue contains a lovely story about nothing.

- page 104 -

This page does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a text document discussing theories about why UFOs choose certain areas for landing, specifically focusing on the Socorro, New Mexico incident. The text describes the theories of a scientist named Thomas of Los Angeles, a former government scientist who is supposed to be the scientific advisor to Empire Film Studios. The text discusses his theories about the geological features of the Socorro area and how they may attract UFOs, as well as his responses to various scientific questions about gravity, planetary motion, and the speed of light. The text also includes a brief description of a UFO sighting over Socorro by a woman who wished to remain anonymous.

"Scientists Indicates Why UFO's Choose Areas for Landing." One Charles A.
Thomas of Los Angeles,"a former government scientist," is supposed to
be the scientific advisor to Empire Film Studios. His theories as to
why UFO's land in New Mexico lack, shall we say, a scientific solidity
in my opinion as he is not listed in the American Men of Science, and I
have no knowledge of him personally. There was some question as to whether
he should be asked to come to SHRW Socorro to give a public lecture on the
general subject. Unfortunately my advice was asked, and I strongly urged
that they not do so unless they find out considerably more about the
gentleman's qualifications first. His principal reason for selecting
Socorro seems to be the following: "The main one can be directly
attributable to the subsurface geology. I would expect there is
a multiplicity of faults, or areas where sedimentary strata
have been tilted to the vertical with the interlayer demonstrations
plains largely in the north-south direction. The effects such subsurface
deceptions have upon the energy distributions between the earth's core
and the Van Allen radiation belt gives it the key to the answer." He also
states that he has stumbled onto many answers to heretofore unsolvable
riddles: What is gravity? Why do planets orbit and rotate? Why do stars
burn in nuclear fires? Is the speed of light really a velocity boundary?
Can this be built which would do everything people who claim they have seen
flying saucers say that those vehicles do?" I hardly need say more.

The same issue, however, contains a story of about "UFO Sighted Streaking
Over City." "The observer, a Socorro woman who asked that her name be withheld
(I have her name, however, a Mrs. Williams,) said the "perfectly round object"
with deep yellow or gold light traveled at tremendous speed. She saw the object
as it came over Socorro Mountain, and it passed southeast over the city.It did
not seen far above the street light. It was unable to get in touch with this
woman, but according to RSAP, this did not have a trail. It seemed to be
just a light.

There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a UFO report document containing text only.

The text from the document is as follows:

Would you be kind enough to send about ten blank forms to Mr. Ted Raynor, Editor, Socorro El Defensor Chieftain, Socorro, New Mexico, and he can send one of these forms to Mrs. Williams to fill out. The results will be, probably, a meteor. I tried to get in touch with her the next day, but she seemed to be at some sewing circle.

March 9 issue has a story "Film Studies Focus Cooperation Here in Film on UFO's". The letter received from Mr. Michael Mistratta, letter sent to Mayor Holm O. Burgan, stated, "Phenomena 7-7 is now completed. It will be viewed by countless millions of people throughout the world. It will open the door to facts heretofore shrouded in secrecy. It will prepare the entire human race for a better knowledge of the universe and possible neighbors who may have been observing our earth for centuries."

Finally, the March 11, Thursday, issue has a short article on "Zamora Saw a UFO, Not Flying Saucer." This was in response to a request by Zamora to please say in the paper that he never saw a flying saucer land, only a UFO. In part the article states, "Zamora says he was trying to cooperate with persons who asked him about the UFO, which he described as egg-shaped, and he wishes that they would not ask him about a flying saucer which he says he has never seen and cannot describe."

This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document or report related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page discusses the following:

R^turn to preceding paragraph before insert A
I gave a copy of Vallee's book and also the Menzel letter which he took home and by the next morning had read completely the manuscript and the letter. LaPaz is still very concerned about the green fireball incident.
Another one was sighted this last Christmas night. According to LaPaz, the official investigation never satisfactorily cleared up the question of why these peculiar uranium green fireballs should have chosen New Mexico to fly over and avoid being seen in other states and why they were so peculiarly grouped. LaPaz is thoroughly convinced that both the green fireballs and Zamora's sightings were observations of advanced vehicles being produced by some project, even more secret than the Manhattan Project.
I am afraid that LaPaz is unshakable from this hypothesis, and his primary criticism of Vallee's book was that Vallee has ignored the green fireballs within, as far as LaPaz is concerned, represent the most important part of the UFO phenomenon. It is always just a matter of viewpoint!
LaPaz showed me his excellent meteorite collection and spent much time in general conversation.
He was engaged for the evening, and we met again early the next morning during which time we took the opportunity for meeting with the President of the University of New Mexico, Dr. Popejoy, and established good ----relations between astronomy at Northwestern and astronomy at New Mexico.

- page 107 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document.

Transcription of the text in the document:

Although LaPaz was impressed with Vallee's book, he felt that his impressive list of references was padded with too many references to unpublished articles or statements. He feels that it is not really a scientific book on the subject (if guess that is about in the year 1980 I will have to write a really scientific book on the subject).

Coming now to the Menzel letter, I will consolidate the opinions of LaPaz, Olives, and of Raynor. I did not show the letter to Zamora because I think it would merely have upset him.

Page 1. I asked Zamora about the reported time when he first heard the explosion, when he was still on the highway. He denies ever having said anything about a flame at that time, only at the time when he saw it rise from the ground. As a matter of fact, he never mentioned anything like that to me, originally, but this did appear in Captain Holder's original report, and he purportedly got this in conversation with Zamora. However, I think this was in the original newspaper writeup. I will have to agree with Menzel that this part of Zamora's evidence is very mixed up and suggests some embroidery of the original sighting either by Zamora or by Captain Holder when excitement was running high.

Page 2. I can't agree with Menzel here. When he wears his glasses, his vision is okay. He had the glasses on when he saw the flame at the time the object was preparing to rise. Now this whole question of the "burning bush": I visited the site again on Saturday, - with Raynor and Shrode, the owner of the radio station, and at no time was any bush seen to be burning, and nobody seems to confirm any actual smoke. All that seen definitely to agree on is that the green snakey-seed and the green greasewood, which are notoriously hard materials to ignite, showed evidence of having been charred, as though they have been seared by a hot flame, and not burned in an ordinary fashion.

- page 108 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document, likely a report, discussing a UFO incident in Socorro, New Mexico. The text on the page describes evidence of the incident, comments from witnesses, and analysis of the reported cardboard remains.

As per the instructions, the text from the document is as follows:

As far as kids having it in for Zamora, there is ample evidence that this is the case. But it was also pointed out to me by Open Finder (sp. ?) and his assistant and by several others, that it is a national phenomenon for teenagers to hate "buzz" and the statement by Wesley Johnston, a high school senior who works at Opelgrinders is particularly significant. He said that many of the high school kids didn't like Zamora, but that he, Zamora, was not important enough to do anything about it. He said that if the kids wanted to get even with Zamora they would simply thrash him or do something to his car, but that an elaborate hoax would not be the way they would get even with him. One enough remember the time of the graffiti there had been no talk in the Socorro region of unidentified flying objects. This would not have suggested itself as a means of getting back at Zamora. Apparently the Socorro teenagers are much more direct in their methods of reprisal for the "buzz." As far as the cardboard is concerned, Menzelfs's conjectures here fall completely flat. The cardboard was portions of very old and weathered corrugated paper from a packing box. There are many samples of this all over the region. There is a city dump not too far away, and when the wind, which blows constantly over the place, gets hold of some of this stuff, it scatters the papers pretty well all over the whole region. Many of the bushes, I noticed particularly this time, have papers caught on their underneath side. In any case, some this paper was still there, and I shall send Menzel a sample of what this cardboard really looks like.  I would say that the cardboard had been there through many rains and had suffered successive dryings.  The original piece I picked up was definitely weathered, but this was the piece I sent to you along with soil samples, you will remember.  One rather interesting item is that the burning bush has recently exuded some sap, and one of the movie people took this to Los Angeles to have it analyzed.

have it analyzed and found it radioactive!  I have also obtained some of the sap which I shall send to you, and maybe Moody can try it out on his super-duper counter.  It is odd that no one seemed to have bothered to have checked this area originally for radiation.  Or did they?
Menzel's idea that the spe
ed was a deliberate decoy, who signaled to the hoaxes by walkie-talkie who then released a balloon with a cardboard or aluminum flying saucer attached thereto simply does not hold water.
Although some of the students do have walkie-talkies, the fact of the matter is that the wind was from the south, and the object went west.  A balloon released at that time would have gone directly over town. Furthermore, they would have had to release the object Zamora got there and watched the object on the ground for a short time.  A previous release would simply have had it well over town by the time Zamora got to the spot.
The dynamite shack does not have legs.  It would have been a place for hoaxes to have hidden over on the other side of the knoll, particularly had they lain prone.
One of the people I talked with gave some credence to the hoax hypothesis, generally considering it to have been far above the capabilities and motivations, and provocations of the hoaxers.  Chaves says that Zamora never described the thing as looking like a balloon.  Zamora knows exactly where the dynamite shack is.  It is plainly visible from the site of the sighting, but about 500 feet to the west.
Zamora does not have any particular schedule for patrolling the town.  He runs of the whole town.
There is no UFO club in town.
No paraphernalia of a hoax were ever found.  It would be rather hard to have done away with all tell-tale evidence, such as tubes of helium, release mechanisms, and so forth.

Transcribed text from the document:

Perhaps I spent too much time on this matter, but the letter was a very convenient device for re-discussing the whole situation. Sgt. Chaves indicated that Menzel should have been a science fiction writer. Actually Lyle Boyd has done some of this, and I believe also Menzel has.

I left Albuquerque in the late morning on Saturday and arrived in Socorro about 1:00 P.M. Raynor, Shrode, and I visited the site and took some more samples, particularly of the sap, and I took a few more pictures, particularly of the dynamite shack to show Menzel. Then I went back to the radio station.

and tried to call the Empire Film Studio, but it was closed.
In view of the fact that the prevailing opinion in the town still
is that what Zamora saw not the result of hallucinations or of a hoax,
but a secret test vehicle, what has become of my suggestion to have this
left as"an exercise for the students"? It would be a marvelous exercise
for neophyte intelligence officers.
There is also the opinion expressed in Socorro, and expressed to me
a number of times in the past, by several people (and also by Lafaz) that
I am merely a part of a super-smoke screen and do in FTD and Wright Field,
and that the whole Project Bluebook is a grand coverup for something the
government does not want discussed. Best way to give a lie to this, of
course, is to point out that if this were the case, the U. S. government
should also have been responsible for the sightings in France, Brazil,
Spain, and in England. Maybe the U. S. government has really gone global!
On that happy thought I conclude my report.
Sincerely yours,
G. Allen Hynek
P. S. I now have a slightly infected/finger from the thorns on the bush that
was originally charred. The bush drew blood when I attempted to get some
soil samples. Undoubtedly, the finger will now wither away from radiation
burns. Unfortunately, I do not have interplanetary Blue Cross coverage!

The image appears to contain a diagram and handwritten notes describing an incident that occurred on April 24, 1964 in Socorro, New Mexico. The diagram depicts a rough sketch of a hill, a depression, and an object that witnesses claimed to have seen. The text provides details about the incident, including the witnesses' observations of the object's movements, shape, and effects. However, the image does not contain any identifiable human faces, so I will not attempt to name or identify any individuals mentioned in the text.

A schematic sketch is included showing a hill, a depression, and an object. The text describes the object as having stopped and then taken off, with witnesses noting two apparent legs and the object appearing to jump. The text also mentions that the object was emitting a flame and was initially thought to be a car, but then turned out to be an unidentified flying object. Further details are provided about the size, shape, and movement of the object, as well as the reactions of the witnesses.

UFO REPORT
April 24, 1964
Lonnie Zamora, 606 Reservoir Street, Socorro, New Mexico, 835-3311, Officer
Socorro Police Force for about 5 years, office phone 835-0941, home on 2-10 pm
About 5:45 pm, 4-24-64, while in Socorro 2 Police Car. ("G" white flashing), he
noticed to the south a shiny object like a car stopped across from Sun Oil Co. (west side
speeding and was about 3 blocks in front of police car. At point on old road turned in
direction of Fair Grounds towards Socorro Ave. the chased car was stopped and two
sons south of Spring Street) the chased car was going straight ahead toward video
ground, car chased was then a bright reddish-orange flame underneath. (It would's
bay, Vinas, about 27). Chased car still about 3 blocks ahead. Lonnie Zamora, 
At this time, heard a roar and saw a flame in the only so the southwest, some
distance away--possibly a 1/2 mile or a mile. Came to mind that a dynamite shack
in that area had blown up, decided to leave chased car go.
Flame was bluish and sort of orange too. Could not tell size of flame. Sort of
yellowish flames, slowly descending. Was still driving car and couldn't pay
too much attention to the flame. It was a bright pulsating type of flame. It was tilted
or slanted, about 30 degrees off bottom, Flame seemed, approximately 3degrees or so in width or 4 degrees wide.
Flame about twice as wide at bottom as top and about four times as high or top
was wide. Did not provide any object at all, and not notice if top of flame was
level. Can was to west bound and not help vision. Had green sun glasses over perception
lens. Could not determine size or flame because it was portion to hill. No one was
seen, and Could not determine a "section" of the flame or if it was continuous and
blowing hard. Clear sunny sky otherwise--just a few clouds scattered over area.
Voice was a roar, not a blast, not like a jet. She changed from high frequency
low frequency and then stopped. Roar lasted for approximately 10 seconds--was going towards
to 8 that time on the route. Gravel road, say flame was about as long as been the
in that plane straight for the sound as long as 10 seconds. Did not notice any
sound of flame, only sound was the roar. No other sounds heard before or after 
except the car in front--and the car in front I have heard it but possibly did not
see it because it was in trees.
After the roar and flame, did not note anything while going up the somewhat steep
rough hill--had to back up and got stopped. There is a home in that area but nobody
was there--and the vehicle still going on, had to back down and determine if the flame 
was out of the vehicle still going on. Had to back down and stop and with
loose gravel and rock. While beginning third time, noise and flame not noted.
After got to top, traveled slowly on the gravel road westward. Noted nothing for
a while, a few seconds, 15 or 20 seconds--went straight ahead, looking around for the
shade--did not recall exactly where she stopped looking around for the object.
Suddenly noted a bright yellow object about 150-200 yards. It was off the road.
At first glance, stopped. It looked, at first, like a car turned upside down.
Came this light bright white flame on whites. Was two people in white coveralls very close to the
object. One of these persons seemed to turn and look straight at my car and seemed
startled--seemed to duck quickly and disappeared.
At this time, I started moving my car towards them quickly, with idea to help,
was stopping. About stopped, shortly a gust of wind blew me backwards -- it was very bright
against the noon background, but not choose. Seemed like scene over and I
at what chance look it to be created white car. The car-report on was sanding 
and a time and disappeared on the report.

Text from the document:

on radiator or on trunk, at this first glance.

The only time I saw these two persons was when I had stopped, for possibly two seconds or so, to confirm at the object. It did not seem my presence or possibly any hats or headgear. These persons appeared normal in shape-but
possibly wore small details or large.

When paid attention to read, while drove towards Socorro. Radioed to sheriff's office Socorro 2, possibly 2 or 3 minutes later. I'll be 10-6 (busy) one of the cars, checking the down line area.

Stopped car, was still talking on radio, started to get out, mike will down, reached up to put up mike. When replaced radio, mike had turned to where knob of car, and started to go down to where knew the object (car) was.

How vehicle stopped around and I got by, was not exactly (a blast). We're up next two rear-but that close Was feel, felt. Not like a jet-known that a jet sounds like. Like a frequency, which noise strong and in loudness - from loud to very loud. As same time as rear, say plane. Plants maybe straight up, plane was light blue and the bottom was sort of off orange color. From this angle objet looked like wing(s) of middle side. Not clear in details. I object roughly enough lense.

As soon as say plane and heard roar, turned away, ran away from object. Road was down- straight like, expect to my left some turns. Except this straight and not too much terrain up and down. Hard to describe flame, possibly a four foot area-very rough guess. Cannot describe flame further. Object gone or not in immediate area.

After fall by car and glasses fell off, kept running to north, with car between us and object. Glasses broken, picked up pieces to place in car about 20 to 25 feet guess-took pieces about six seconds. When object started to move I ran at full distance back. I guess is where I checked down, just over top of hill. I guess I had run approx 25 feet when I disturbed body and the object started move level with the car and it appeared to shoot forward, at and angled down-towards the ground, covering my face with my arms. Being that there was no sound, I looked up. I turned away from the object going down toward ground, covering my face with my arms. Being that there was no sound, I looked up. I turned away from the object going down toward ground and I jumped over the hill-I suppose because I did not hear the roar. I was scared of the roar, and I had planned to do continue running down the hill. I turned around toward the object and at the same time this put my head toward the ground, covering my face with my arms. Being that there was no roar, I looked up. I could see the object going away from me, getting smaller and smaller. This was all within 5 or 6 seconds, maybe less. There was no sound or flame at any time, and the whine lasted maybe 5 seconds or there was complete silence about the object. As it went up, when it reached up by 1,500 to 2,000 feet, it appeared to be in straight line, then the dynamic almost back by about three feet. Object was traveling very fast. It seemed to take up, and fade off immediately in distance.

Now, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

He asked, "What is it?" I answered, "It looks like a balloon." I don't know if he may have looked at his wrist, which doesn't have seen it. I did not tell him at the moment which window to look out of.
As I was calling Dep, I could still see the object. The object seemed to lift up slightly, close to the ground, and seemed to glide slowly on the ground. The object had no flame whatsoever as it was traveling over the ground, and no smoke or noise.
Peeling in good health, last drink--two or three beers--was over a month ago. Noted no odors, smoke or ground craters then disappeared. Was quite different to UFO types at radio and to Sergeant M3 Chaves to get there - Went down to where the object had been. I asked Sgt. Chaves what he had seen, and he said he had turned on the light and seen an object, but that it had also disappeared. At this time I moved back to my car, told him I was looking for me. Then Sgt. Chaves came up, asked me what I was doing, and I told him what I was doing.
I asked the Sgt. to see what I saw and that was the burning brush. Then Sgt. Chaves and I went to the spot and the ground had also been burned out the brush.
When I first saw the object (when I thought it might be a car,) I saw what appeared to be two legs or some type from the object to the ground. At the same time, I didn't pay much attention to what it was--I thought it was an accident--I saw the two persons.
I didn't pay much attention to the two "legs." The two "legs" were at the bottom of the object and seemed to extend to the ground, seem to be about three and a half feet from the ground, at that time. I just glanced at it.
Can't tell how long may object remain. (Possibly "seconds; possibly 20 seconds--just a guess--for a from the time got out of car, glanced at object, ran from object, looked over object to see what it was, object disappeared.
As my mile fall, I got out of my car, at same area, I heard about two or three loud "bumps." did not see anything unusual in the sky. There "bumps" were possibly a second or long. This was just before the object was over the road. The "bumps" were not seen when I got to the scene area.
Just before Sgt. Chaves got to the scene, I got my pen and drew a picture of the insignia on the object.

INFORMATION RELATIVE TO THE SOCORRO SIGHTING OF UFO BY LONNIE ZAMORA

On 24 April 1964, I received a call from Captain Richard T. Holder, USAF, of the 896th Radar Squadron at Holloman AFB, Quintanilla requesting that the Socorro sighting be investigated. This action was dictated by a call from the Command Post at 330, a call from the Emergency Action Group at 430 and another call from the Command Post just prior to my notification of the same. The contacts for details collected were made by Col King at Albuquerque and Capt White at White Sands (32-15-1972).

At 0600 I contacted the Base Duty Officer and was informed that Major Conner was the Kirkland Investigator for UFO reports. I contacted Major Conner and requested permission to accompany him to Socorro. I contacted Col King and a meeting was arranged for 0830. The only information Col King had was that which was included in the report made by Lonnie Zamora. This report was forwarded to Washington and Col King/ASD/ASD as the Command Post. (This report is included as an attachment in Major Conner's report.)

A geiger counter was obtained and Major Conner and I departed for Socorro arriving about 1200 in Socorro. The State Police officer who was the first to reach Lonnie Zamora (State Police Officer Nieto) and during the interview the following information was obtained:

Shortly after 1700 Lonnie Zamora was on patrol and radioed in to the city police that there was a 10-7 (auto accident) and he was proceeding to investigate. It appeared as if an auto had turned over and two people were in the vicinity. Sgt Chavez immediately made an effort to reach patrolman Zamora and arrived about 3 minutes after the object under observation by Lonnie Zamora had disappeared. Sgt Chavez then went to the area where the craft or thing was supposed to be sighted and found four fresh indentations in the ground and several charred or burned bushes. Smoke appeared to come from the bush and he assumed that it was burning, however, when he placed his hand over the bush it was still cold to the touch. Sgt Chavez contacted the FBI, who in turn contacted White Sands and Agents Barnes and Lt R T Holder of the latter organization arrived to conduct an investigation and obtain various samples of the soil and charred bush. Sgt Chavez secured the area and the only instructions were "do not disturb". It was determined that the only time the marks were fresh and the bush still warm was at the time Lonnie Zamora observed the vehicle and the activity and that there was no other activity at that location other than that noted in the FBI report. Further he stated that the marks were definitely "fresh", and the dirt showed evidence of "heat" or moisture. Sgt Chavez is firm in that he could not track any activity was evident. At no time did he observe the craft or object described by Patrolman Zamora.

This page of the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a detailed written description of an incident that occurred in Socorro, New Mexico in 1964.

The text describes the events as reported by Lonnie Zamora, who was on patrol when he heard a noise and turned off the road to investigate. He described seeing an object on the ground and two people near it. The object was white or silver in color and egg-shaped. Zamora took Polaroid pictures of the area and the object, though the text does not indicate if those photographs are included in this document.

The text goes on to provide a detailed sequence of events, describing how Zamora observed the object, the noise it made, and its eventual departure. The text also mentions that Zamora's account was corroborated by other witnesses and investigators.

The text output from the OCR is as follows:

and a drawing of this marking will be attached at the end of the report. 
We cannot be firm in chile the color was used. At this point of altitude the object was red and a drawing of this marking will be attached at the end of the report. We cannot be firm in the color was used. At this point of altitude the object was red and not more than a few seconds and began to move laterally to his right (TV) along the line of the gully about 10 seconds as the dynamite check by not more than two or three feet and fading in the distance near a mill about 5 miles away.
Sgt. Chavez arrived on the scene. About 3 minutes later. About 8 minutes later Sgt Chavez arrived on the scene.
Area background. Photos have been obtained of the background. An airfield (Private) is located about a mile to the opposite side of the road where the object was located and Zamora's car was parked. To the right about 200 ft is the dynamite shack, about 6ft tall, if it square and silver in color. Measurements of these factors can be made if deemed essential.
The sighting was made at least an hour before sunset. At 1630 pm the sun was still visible above the mountains to the west.
Lt Holder was visited and the report made by the FBI agent (Mr Barnes) and Capt Holder claimed no knowledge of the red mark. Extensive diagrams of the holes had been made and measurements taken. He indicated that the samples could be analyzed at White Sands. Also a check had been made with the local Radar stations and no U/I tracks carried at the time of the sighting. Further check indicated that no halo activity was in the area. White Sands has two or three sites where halo at the sites were located at the other end of the state on Monday morning. A copy of the FBI report and Capt Holder's report and measurements to be forwarded to Major Conner's along with analysis of the charred specimen.
No conclusion as to cause could be reached by myself or Major Conner.
Coral Lorensen and husband were in Socorro at the time and had interviewed Sgt Chavez and also Capt Holder prior to my arrival. Copy of Major Conner's IR as attachments will be the FBI report, Capt Holder's report, Photos of the area, and specific slides taken that evening by Sgt Chavez to the scene. Specific statements as to radar activity, (none) halo activity (all known holes in the area) and inquiry into the red marking should be made.
Copies of the local news releases have been forwarded to Capt Q and the basic investigative efforts have been completed. I called Capt Q upon return from Socorro at 1930, Sunday 26 April and advised him of the above information.

The text in the document is as follows:

On Tuesday, April 28, 1964, in response to a call from Captain Quintanilla, I enplaned for Albuquerque to meet with Major Conner of Kirtland Air Force Base and associate me, I called a prospective graduate student in astronomy, now working at Kirtland Air Force Base, before I left the office, asking him to meet me. This proved totally unnecessary since, when the plane arrived at Albuquerque, I was met at the airport by Major Conner himself, and we drove to the Air Force Base where I was introduced to the young man from the plane to the effect that "there must be a celebrity aboard" and discussions so by me as I was the plane numerous flash bulbs began popping, and I was importuned for one interview after another. Since I knew nothing, there was very little that I could say, and consequently I got out of the situation very easily. It would appear that Major Conner F HQ man very effective, I had unfortunately neglected to ask Major Conner in advance to keep things quiet.
As soon as I got the report out of my head we went to Major Conner's office at Kirtland Air Force Base, where I called Dr. LaPaz by phone to ask whether the Major had gone down to Socorro with us. He was unable to make it, but told me that a number of a years before he had worked with Zamora on a filed trip in search of a fallen meteorite. He gave Zamora a very clean bill of health and said that he was a completely reliable person. He then hunted down in the Air Force car for Socorro, which is nearly an hour from Albuquerque, where I had a flat tire. It turned out that the jack was missing, although the car had been repaired in excellent shape, and so we had to wait till passengers by, finally snagging one car whose occupants indicated that they would uniform the occupant's office town. Time passed and we snagged another car, this time with four women in it. They took me into town so that I could relay the call, and this man rather terse, but generous, Chavez before the rest (Major Conner and Mr. James Wray, the prospective graduate student ) got down. It was during this preliminary interview in the jail that Sergeant Chavez told me that Zamora was getting discouraged with the whole thing and with the general misrepresentation he was the victim of. After some general reluctance, Sergeant Chavez agreed to have Zamora there so that I could talk to him privately. I agreed to this, and when the private car I finally got down with Lieutenant Cariola, we went to the jail to talk with Zamora, who appeared somewhat haggard (it was now quite late in the day, and he had had little sleep the next), and after dinner, Major Conner and Mr Wray went back to Albuquerque, and I went to the jail to talk for the next two hours with Zamora and Chavez.
After a fairly lengthy time spent in getting them warmed up to the subject, I got the major sketch of the situation. During one or two times when Zamora (who was on duty) had to step out of the room, Chavez told me of some of Zamora's reactions. Apparently Zamora was not going to say anything about it, but it was at Chavez' advice that he did. He then apparently looked disturbed.

- page 131 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document, possibly a Project Blue Book report, describing an incident that occurred in Socorro, New Mexico in 1964.

The text in the document is as follows:

Asked Chaves whether Chaves thought that he, Zamora, should first speak to the priest before saying anything. Chaves indicated that this was up to him. Chaves described Zamora's radio call to him on that evening, and indicated that Zamora had asked him to come out alone. Chaves indicated that, when he got to Zamora, he found him very badly shaken, pale, and sweating. He attempted to kid him, saying, "What's the matter, couldn't you look after your girl?" but Zamora indicated that Zamora was reluctant to go down into the small ravine, and asked that Chaves precede him, even though it was still bright daylight. It was Chaves who first discovered the imprint. During the interview, Zamora was far from talkative, and there seemed to be a few minor contradictions as to just where he was when he first radioed in, etc., and even as to how many times he had radioed in. Both Zamora and Chaves appeared to have been impressed that whatever they had seen had been a real "air force devise, so that they could dismiss the whole thing from their minds." Zamora was still evidently troubled over some of the town's reactions, and Chaves was disturbed by the hullabaloo and the misrepresentations and the fluidity of the "reports."

After my talk with the two men at the courthouse, I called Captain Holder and asked him to have me. He came down to pick me up, and invited me to his home instead, and transmitted to me a carbon copy of his report, and the statements describing himself.

Exhibit A) Captain Holder was most helpful and anxious to demonstrate that he had done a good job in procuring measurements, and other data before the coming of the crowd of curiosity seekers. I, of course, before the coming of the crowd of curiosity seekers. I, of course, had to sift through a good deal of irrelevant material, some of which, of course, dealt with the physical possibility and of the connection of the tracks with the sighting, etc. Chaves, as did all others whom I questioned, indicated that the markings were to all intensive purposes, fresh and were associated burned, or that the burning seemed to be sporadic. Clumps of grass in close proximity to the burned ones were untouched, while others just a short distance away from the unburned ones were again burned, etc.

I put up at a local motel, making arrangements to be taken out to the site first thing in the morning. Mr. Zamora and Sergeant Chaves joined me at breakfast the next morning, but just previous to that, a man whose name I did not get, he introduced himself as from the FAA, and indicated to me that it was strange that their radars had not picked up anything. He felt that, MIT radars can pick up cars on the road, that this object should certainly have been picked up by the radar equipment.

In going out to the site, I asked that precisely the same road be traveled that was traversed on the evening of the sighting, and so we did, and as we went along, Zamora pointed out the place where the

The text in the document is as follows:

speeding car had turned into his line of sight from a side road and followed the small path then going to the place about 1/2 mile south of Socorro where he had seen the flame and had heard a loud roar. It must be remembered that this time he was giving chase to a speeding car, and it would seem that, to be diverted from this jolly procedure, the noise and/or light must have been fairly strong. He stated that the object hovered briefly and then moved off in the direction in which he had seen the flame and heard the roar. He stressed only the roar and the fact that he thought the Mayor's dynamic shock had exploded and that somebody might have been in trouble.

From that point on, his report to me was virtually identical to that he gave to Captain Holder - his three attempts to get up the hill, his moving around longitudinally down the small arroyo - it was at this point that he thought he saw an overturned car resting, however, either on the trunk or on its radiator. He described that, at this point, he picked up the radio, called back Sergeant Shives. There is a little contradiction here, probably not serious, as to where he had made that call, exactly how many calls he made.

He then stated that he proceeded down the very poor gravel road, temoporarily losing sight of the object behind a slight rise in the land, that is, behind one of the hillocks that formed an arroyo between them. He said that, as he came up upon the object from behind, as he was driving and continued to drive for some distance, he apparently saw the object again while he was engaged the pursuing car at the clearing just before the ground descends into the little arroyo (as shown in photograph no.2). This is important in that it is a clear indication that any common object would certainly have been easily recognized. It would seem virtually incredible that an ordinary object, such as a balloon, helicopter, private small plane, etc. could have remained unidentified, and further, could have caused such sudden fright as he indicated.

Zamora drove up to this spot, windows rolled down, and looked to his left out the window to see the object. At this point, he indicated that he still thought that "it" might have been an overturned car. It is not clear whether he made a call to the station at this time (presumably he did), but, in any event, he knocked the mike to the floor, as he got out of the car, apparently in some excitement. He started to walk towards the object, but apparently did not get very far before he heard some noises. The noises were described as two or three bangs, as though something was being tossed away (he described it as "Let's get the Hell out of here") and this was followed almost immediately by a roar. He did not describe the pitches of the roar to me as well as he had in Capt Holder's report. Apparently, by this time Zamora was as he had in Capt Holder's report.

- page 133 -

The image contains a photograph depicting the scene described in the text. The photograph shows a small object or craft hovering off the ground, with the witness Zamora in the distance observing it. There are no human faces visible in the photograph.

From all of the above and from my personal observations, I would conclude the following: That Zamora, although not overly bright or articulate, is basically sincere, honest, and reliable. He would not be capable of concluding a complex hoax, nor would his temperament indicate that he was simply a crank on duty, relinquished one discharge of that duty (chasing a speeding car) for another which he thought was more immediate importance. (Investigating the possible explosion of a dynamite shack). His fright was genuine.

Text from the document:

and his feeling that he had seen something truly unusual is attested
by the fact that he asked whether he should speak to the priest first
before saying anything about it.

Any question of hallucination seems clearly out. He is a non-drinking
man, and is considered, well-balanced, physically healthy individual. (Photograph No 10). He is a cop who looks as though he could be pretty gruff
with his customers, and in fact, his companions about the UFO sighting
was what it did not allow him to give out his full quota of tickets
for the day. (Photograph will be of Socorro, New Mexico Policeman who
testified to seeing the UFO object). Both men seemed to give
every indication of being devoid of false and being basically simple
and honest. Photograph No 12 is a close-up of one of the markings,
made very shortly after the craft had departed.

By the time that I got to see the area, it had been so badly trampled
over that I could make no assessment of possible burned areas. There appear
to be a fair amount of charred particles mixed in with the dirt, and
some charred cardboard was also found (one). In conclusion, therefore,
that Zamora saw a tangible, physical object, under good daylight
illumination, and from fairly close (at the closest, almost as
little as 100 feet).

It appears certain, that we discover what the physical object actually
was. It is clear that the UFO officandos are going to make a great
case of this one. Two days before me Lorensen, husband of
Carol Lorensen of AFPO, had visited and taken numerous samples of charred
remains and of rocks and ground, I had been at the site more
than ten minutes when Mr Sanford of NICAP showed up and took samples.
Photographs, of course, I made at that time as to how Zamora would
describe this ones. No damage, explacing this ones. My mind but that NICAP
and AFRO, and possibly others considered this was significant, 
standing for an investigation, and will decide any attempt to "explain
it away" as "hallucination conservation".They will see
great store on the paucity of the burns and the relative lack of
disturbance would have been very much exaggerated. They will probably say
that the burns are "plasticized" which can scorch locally, I understand.

It is therefore essential to consider this case of the major UFO sightings
in the history of the Air Force's consideration of this subject, and
to spare no effort in establishing whatever maneuvers of any sort were
taking place in that locality either on the part of the Air Force, the
Army, or even the Navy. However, I am quite certain that it will not
be sufficient for the Air Force in this case to indicate that the sighting
was probably a new type of craft being tested, or that a secret war
was going on or such.

OUTPUT TEXT:

maneuver was in progress, unless the log of such maneuvers is produced,
and better yet, the entire "crime" reinstated, preferably in Zamora's
presence. I recognize that this will be a very difficult task, but
I think every attempt should be made to do this. It will require
the secrecy of the Air Force himself.

It would be well, further, for "files protection" for the Air Force to
tabulate from its records, and from available records from other sources,
of other reported landings, such as, for instance, the chronological list
of such landings, and if possible, the conditions under which these
occurred. Ignorance of what NICAP and APRO will designate as similar cases will be
of little help.

In about a month, I shall have occasion to return to the Socorro area,
at which time I will discuss with Zamora and Chaves after the excitement
has completely subsided down, some the finer points of the sighting,
such as the location at which radio calls were made, etc.

The wind at this time was blowing very strongly from the south and
I established by repeated questioning that the object had taken off
either at right angles or partially into the wind.

I have not stressed the insignia which Zamora reported, since he drew
directly for me something which I had shown for Capt Holder. The question
him always times on the shape of the object, and as to whether it had clear
windows and if the machine had landed - about the results were
virtually the same as the information given to Capt Holder. The object
was egg-shaped, and the inverted V insignia on it, two legs seemed to
be protruding from the object which was not chrome but "whitish-
aluminium", and it was further established that the great roar during
its initial take-off disappeared suddenly and the horizontal flight away
and over the hills where clouds were noticed.

I questioned Mr Art Burns of the FBI, and several others who had been
on the site within the first hours after the sighting as to the alleged
freshness of the tracks. They were all of the opinion that the tracks
were under fresh.

Although Zamora was the only witness to the actual sighting, nine
people in all say she markings. Altogether nine people say the markings
within hours of the sighting and before the hours of curiosity seekers
descended upon the place the following day.

After I visited the place of the sighting, I had several other talks
with local people, and, in particular, with the reporter of the El Defensor
Chieftain, on perhaps it was the editor (its a small paper). I believe
that I talked with Mr Lavis A Renden, the publisher of the El Defensor.

Transcription of the text in the document:

He had gone into this thing quite thoroughly and in a quite sedate and unexcited manner. His story, published "TECHNICAL APRIL 25, 1964, includes one item not mentioned previously: "At least one other person - an unidentified tourist - was the first to notify the UFO before it landed in a gulley." Opel Grinder, manager of Whitting Brothers' Service Station on 85 North, said the man stopped at the station and remarked that he had seen something like "two helicopters in the distance," and the tourist said, "It was a funny looking thing, didn't make any noise." The man said further that the object had flown over his car. It actually was headed straight for the gully where it landed moments later. The tourist also commented that he had seen a police car heading up the hill. This was apparently prior to the event.

I believe that we can dispense with the rash of other reports that sprang up immediately thereafter. This was the case near Santa Fe, the case in Montana, the girl with scorched eyes because she looked at a flying saucer in Albuquerque, and others. But, it is essential that the Socorro case be given the treatment.

I also questioned a while in Socorro, in the office of Wm. Becker, principal of the School of Mines, who according to the newspaper accounts, apparently was also an eye-witness to the events going on in the area at the time. He, as the rest of the townspeople, were puzzled by the event, but the general underground gull of opinion was that it would turn out to be some device which the government still had under wraps. Not one person whom I talked with in the least by either implication or inuendo, challenged Zamora's veracity.

Finally, the drawings which Captain Holder and his associates made, when replotted according to scale, (already enclosed with the report of Captain Holder, already sent to you) which indicate that the discrepancies between the markings intersected perpendicularly. It would appear essential that for this case to be fairly closed out, if the interpretation is that of a new device and its dimensions are to match the findings found on the ground, this the device finally selected should be expected to match these marks observed.

I left Socorro shortly after noon on Wednesday, April 29th, Major Conner and James Ray having come down late that morning to pick me up. We had a late lunch enroute to Albuquerque.

In Albuquerque, I had the opportunity to talk with Mr Arthur Burns, of the FBI, who added nothing new to the situation but confirmed the general reliability and stability of Mr Zamora. He also was of the opinion that the marks might well have been fresh ones.I also called the mother of the young girl whose eyes were allegedly burned by having looked too long at a flying saucer, and found that the name of the Doctor who treated her and who had confirmed the burns, was a Dr Best of Albuquerque. Major Conner indicated that he would investigate further. That is all.

Additional Notes to the Report:
It should be noted that, at the time Zamora saw the insignia, the craft was well illuminated by auxiliary lights which seemed to form some experiments with placards with insignia and different patterns inscribed thereon to see how well these are visible, under good lighting, at 100-200 feet.

Additional Note: What is the power of Zamora's glasses? Does he suffer from a stigmatism?

Additional Note: Several things are a pity in this situation. One is that there was not an additional witness. Second is that no photographs were taken. Third, that no radars picked up the object, and fourth that the witness whom we did have was not a better observer and more articulate.

Recommendations: The object which produced this, if it was a new device under test or in maneuvers, be brought to some location and devices taken of it departing in the manner described by Zamora, and under the same lighting conditions. This then could be played at any future hearings on flying saucers. This, it seems to me, could go a very long way toward exploding the myth of flying saucers. This it seems to me would be more good than all the previous years of propaganda.

Hoffa on Trial
in Fraud Case
CHICAGO, April 27 (International) - Union President James R. Hoffa currently appealing a conviction with seven associates today is a key figure in a new $20 million civil suit in Chicago federal court. 
Hoffa said the case was "just another persecution", both prosecution and defense (Continued from Page 1)

Government Hopes to Destroy Hoffa's Power
CHICAGO, April 27 - The Government case against Teamster's Union President James R. Hoffa, which opens here today marks the beginning of his long Justice Department battle to destroy his power.
Hoffa's power stems directly at the main source of Teamster's wealth, the 1.9 million Central States Pension Fund assets estimated at over $1 billion.
The Government case charges that Hoffa and six other officials of the Teamsters Union and Pension Fund conspired to loot the Fund to the tune of $18 million.

It hopes by this prosecution to separate Hoffa from the Pension Fund and thus undermine the source of his power.

Court Shuns
Rail Jobs Case
WASHINGTON, April 27 - The Supreme Court refused today to review a bitter railway labor case involving more than 15,000 jobs and leave the status of some 18,000 employees in doubt.
The high court in a 5-3 decision upholding the lower court said that the rail unions involved had failed to show the required injury to seek judicial review of the dispute.

LYNDA BIRD JOHNSON, daughter of the President, broke her engagement Saturday. Mrs. JOHNSON'S other daughter, LUCI, is to be married June 9 at the White House.

Police Capture Three Burglars
Police captured three burglars in two separate incidents over the weekend. A nine-hour manhunt led to the arrest of two burglars who had broken into a Rassett Shopping Center store. Radio Patrolman H. L. Harris and Detectives Thomas S. Keenan and Robert S. Malaney made the arrests. They were charged with burglary and theft. The other incident involved the arrest of one burglar who had broken into a home. David Moody used a shotgun to capture the suspect after a neighbor reported a prowler on the property. 

Maryland Views Wallace
WASHINGTON, April 27 - Maryland's Democratic leaders are taking a dim view of George C. Wallace's announced intention to campaign in the state for the May 19 Democratic primary. The state's Attorney General, Thomas B. Finan, said "there comes a day we must take a stand against those who preach hate and intolerance," and promised that Wallace would not receive a welcome with "open arms" in Maryland.

Power, Prove He Dipped Into Millions
UNLIKE MOST pension fund and government officials who seek their influence and power through real-estate loans, Albert J. Carito drew his influence from his position as an insurance agent and advisor. According to the grand jury, Carito made his influence count through various of the seven others in the complex real-estate transaction involving nearly $10 million in mortgage loans close to Hoffa. The indictment charges that Carito used his influence to intervene on Hoffa's behalf when the Teamsters sought to reduce their influence with him. 

However, it is alleged, Carito and several of the others made "false and misleading statements" about the loans to the trustees of the Teamster pension fund. IN ONE CASE, according to the charges, Hoffa told the trustees that a $2 million loan would be needed to buy a home for the personal use and benefit of the borrower.

LANDING PROBED BY ASKS TESTS

U-Shaped Object Seen By Policeman

Evidence on Desert Floor Supports Officer's Story 

SOCORRO, N.M. (AP) - Lonnie Zamora, a Socorro policeman, said he was driving along a desert road 18 miles south of here Friday night when he saw a shiny object on the ground. 

As he pulled up, Zamora said, an object shaped like a letter "U" rose from the ground and flew slowly away. Later, Zamora said, he found an area on the desert floor supporting his claim something had landed there.

The Air Force was called in to investigate the incident. The craft was described as about 15 feet long and 5 or 6 feet wide. 

Zamora said he heard a roar and saw flames as the object rose from the ground and flew over the desert. He said the craft was silver in color and had two legs or landing gears. 

Deputy Sheriff James Luckie said "very few have seen anything like this in the county before." The incident was reported to the sheriff's office at 6 p.m. Friday.

UFO Sighting, Socorro, New Mexico, 24 Apr 64
13 May 64
Hq USAF SAFOI PB (Mrs Gaiser)
Webb 25 D.C.
1. The following is a resume on the unidentified flying object sighted by Mr. Lonnie Zamora, of Socorro, New Mexico.
a. At approximately 1745, 24 Apr 64, while giving chase to a speeding car, Mr. Zamora heard a roar and saw an object which he believed to be an explosion or a plane crash. He stopped his patrol car, about one half mile away. Mr. Zamora saw a shiny object which he believed was also a policeman for the Socorro Police Department, holding it in his hand. The object suddenly rose up and decided to go to the shack and not pursue the speeding car.
b. Mr. Zamora claims that the flame was bluish and sort of orange. He could also see the size of the flame which was slowly descending. The flame was of a narrow type and appeared to be of a funnel shape. At this time he was still driving his car and did not pay too much attention.
c. As Mr. Zamora got closer to the object, he noted it was an egg-shaped shiny object, about 15 feet long and about 6-7 feet wide. He noted that it was resting about one or two feet off the ground, that it had no windows and no seams. It was still emitting a flame from the underpart. He suddenly noted to the south of this position a shiny object, which appeared to be a car, turned upside down. He thought some kids might have turned it over. At this particular time the object appeared to be quite close to him.
d. As the object was about to take off, Mr. Zamora noted two small figures, about 4 or 5 feet in height, appear near the object. The objects seemed to suddenly start moving rapidly and the two small figures re-entered the object before it began its ascent. Mr. Zamora was about 300 yards away from the object when it took off and he was heading in its direction until it began ascending. At this point, he turned his patrol car around and beat a hasty retreat from the scene. The object accelerated rapidly and disappeared from his sight. The whole incident lasted about 10 minutes.

Mystifying Flying Object Is Sighted 

Unusual Marks Found

The man in the street was mystified and officials began "investigating" today following reports of the landing of an unidentified flying object on the outskirts of Socorro Friday afternoon and the sighting of a strange craft, said to be "shiny and brightly shaped."

Sgt. Zamora, told of seeing the egg-shaped vehicle, roughly the size of an automobile, which landed a flash in the southwest sky about 5 p.m. Friday while on routine patrol.

He said he got within about 100 yards of the strange craft, saw two "men" adjacent to it, and hurried away when the object took off with a roar and a burst of flame.

Reports of the incident poured in from Stallion Gate, Stallion Site and State Police headquarters. A report to State Police here Saturday at 6 p.m. by Sgt. Zamora stated that the "object" had been seen to go down in the vicinity of State Highway 85, some 12 miles from Socorro. He stated no particular search of the area was made. It was not clear what, if any, evidence of the incident had been gathered.

Policeman Recalls Night Which Changed His Life
By JAKE BOCHER
Socorro, N.M. - (UPI) - Police Patrolman Lonnie Zamora says now he can hardly believe what happened to him one night two weeks ago in the isolated desert southwest of here.
It was about 5:45 p.m. on a Wednesday afternoon-evening shift and Zamora was investigating what sounded like a dynamite explosion in the hills about five miles from this city.
What he found kept him on the scene for nearly two hours. He says it was something he can't explain, and the encounter has changed his outlook on life.
"I was more frightened than I've ever been in my life," said the 55-year-old officer, who has been on the force 17 years.
The 31-year-old father of five said he has convinced about 1,000 state and federal officers - including the FBI, Air Force UFO investigator, Allen Hynek of Northwestern University, and state police - that he saw something strange that evening. He said he radioed for assistance and stayed on the scene until other officers arrived.
"I don't know what it was," Zamora said. "I just know I saw it."
The officer said the experience has had an impact on him. He now tries to keep more to himself and wonders what more would be revealed if other policemen would come forward about similar experiences.
Zamora said he and his wife are trying to get back to normal. They were today going to have dinner in their patrol car for the first time since the incident.
"I don't know what it was and I'm still trying to figure it out," he said.

Radar Tie-In Sought To UFO Report
Socorro, N.M. (AP) - Radar operators were investigating yesterday whether a saucer-shaped object they spotted in the skies over Socorro, New Mexico, was the same one reported by police. Col. George L. Higgs, commander of the 29th Air Division, said the radar contact was made at about the same time and place where a policeman said he saw an egg-shaped object land and then depart. The officer, Lonnie Zamora, said the object was about 15 to 20 feet long and 10 to 15 feet high, with red lettering or markings on the side. He said it took off with a roar and a blast of flame, leaving an imprint on the ground. The Air Force said it was investigating the incident. Higgs said the radar contact lasted about 10 minutes.

'Talked With Occupants'
Man Here Claims He
Saw Saucers 5 Times
BY MARTIN PASKINS
"I don't know why they picked me," said Appolinar Villa, a mechanic. Villa is just an ordinary working man - just a mechanic.
Many times he has seen there was a purpose. What it is, I don't know.
These times in about five years, says "Paul" Villa, he has seen with his own eyes flying saucers - an air of mystery and quality of knowledge.
"I expect Volcanic Activity near the saucer crew," he said, "expect a large-scale renewal of volcanic activity like west of here. And they expect a glow from that volcanic activity."
This year, they expect catastrophic war between Russia and China to involve many Asian nations.
Villa hasn't sought a purpose of safety. "They can't get away from what God has planned for them," Villa said. His first saucer sighting came on the West Side in the summer of 1959. "Twice," the devices hovered about 100 feet above the home, Villa said. The home was burned. Villa said his burning, for which he had no insurance, left him practically penniless.
Later in June 1960, Villa said, he spent 2:30 to 4:30 in the morning watching saucers near Lindrith. "The devices seemed to be the largest- about 900 feet in diameter and they make noise like a swarm of bees." This, Villa said, scared some would-be audience. Permits was about 160 feet above the ground.
Villa said the saucers contained a large number of people from the far distant places. He pointed out that since the meetings some people from the in-distant places he has become religious.
Next as the meeting, and in listening to politics before and since, Villa said he acquired knowledge of the strange's plans. His efforts to convert people to his ways of thinking have not been the sole success he had hoped, Villa said he was left virtually penniless by a stroke of "bad fortune". His home was burned - totally and without insurance. He went through bankruptcy.
Everything seems to have gone against Villa - except his convictions. "They've chosen me, not anybody else, to tell this story," he said.

Air Force UFO Expert to Check 'Saucer' Reports
SOCORRO, N.M. - Dr. J. Allen Hynek, special consultant to the Air Force on unidentified flying objects, is coming to Socorro Tuesday night to begin his investigation of a mysterious flying object that was reportedly seen here early Tuesday morning.

Dr. Hynek, director of the Dearborn Observatory at Northwestern University, said he would arrive in Socorro Tuesday afternoon. His investigation, he said, would determine whether the object was a real flying saucer. 

The object was first reported to New Mexico Tech policeman Lonnie Zamora, who said he saw the object land and a person appear near it. Zamora said he saw the object this morning before it took off again. 

Officials at Holloman Air Force Base near Alamogordo said they would send Hynek, a civilian scientific advisor to the Air Force, to investigate the reported incident.

Believes Intelligent Beings on UFOs Sighted in State

"These unidentified flying objects, which were described as 'looking like a mountain lion's head' and colored a reddish or pink glow, have been sighted in this area since Friday when Socorro Police Department's Sgt. Lonnie Zamora said he saw one come down near a dirt road and then take off at great speed.

Mrs. Coral Lorenzen, director of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, turned from investigating the sighting of Zamora which was reported Friday.

She said she was convinced the Socorro sighting, plus other similar ones in the state, were part of an "authentic" series of UFO sightings.

The photos mailed to the director by an unnamed "intelligent" source of Unidentified Flying Objects sighted in 1963 by a shipyard worker were also considered by Mrs. Lorenzen. 

These photos were taken by the worker and show what appear to be "somewhat hazy, but clearly visible" objects, having the color and a glow in the dark, she said.

Mrs. Lorenzen said the incidents which she has investigated in New Mexico since 1952 now point to the possibility that beings from another planet have visited the state.

She claims there are six to eight landings in New Mexico each year and she believes they are made by beings from another planet.

The Aerial Phenomena Research Organization formed by Mrs. Lorenzen in 1952 said the sightings now number into the hundreds in its files, with no reports of injuries or deaths attributed to the "creatures" described as seen during the incidents.

A Mr. Zamora stopped his car while he was still talking on the radio and started to get out. He finished his conversation with the sheriff's office in Socorro where the object was. He then became aware of a very loud roar, something like a jet, which seemed to come from over the arroyo a short distance from the object. Object started to rise from the ground, slowly. The color was light blue and some of orange, but he saw no smoke. However, the object made a rather sharp turning motion, then departed at a high rate of speed, so fast that he could not see the flame and heard the roar turn suddenly away from the object. He looked in the direction of this departure, but the object had already disappeared. He was so impressed, got up and proceeded away from the object for a few seconds.
When he looked back, the object had completely disappeared. It lifted its hand and gave a signal that appeared to go straight up, slowly. The object was on the ground for 2 or 3 minutes. It was approximately 20 feet long and about 6 or 6 1/2 feet high. As it lifted off, it came out of a shallow indentation in the ground in which it had been resting. Zamora went back to the station to look out the window and see if he could spot the object, because he was facing it and could not see the object from this angle. He said the object appeared to be so hot that it left a shiny mark on the ground. He waited for a few minutes but could not see the object, therefore he did not know in which direction it had gone. It is my belief that the object which probably belongs to one of the government agencies while he Zamora saw some from outer space, we may or may not ever know.

'Flying Bathtub' Seen by Motorist

SOCORRO, April 27 (AP) - Socorro police were called to investigate reports of a strange flying object over the city. Patrolman Lonnie Zamora said he was pursuing a speeding car when he saw a strange, shiny object in the air near the Cary Reservoir.

Zamora said the object landed and two people emerged from it. He said the object was about 15 feet long, oval-shaped, and silvery in color. He said when he approached it, the object took off again and disappeared in the southeast direction. Zamora said it made a roaring sound and scorched the brush and ground where it had landed.

Other officers who joined Zamora said they found indentations in the ground and burned brush at the site.

Heights Resident Saw Object Here

A resident of Socorro said her friend saw a strange silvery object flying over the State Fairgrounds last Thursday afternoon.

The resident, who asked that her name not be published, said the object was definitely not an airplane. She said her friend was traveling south on San Pedro between 3:30 and 4 p.m. when they saw the UFO.

She said the object was more or less egg-shaped, similar to the description given by Officer Lonnie Zamora of an object he saw land near Socorro.

Girl Says She Was Burned While Watching UFO Land

Patrolman Lonnie Zamora said he was pursuing a hot rod when he sew two objects in the sky that appeared to be landing. He stopped his car and observed two small beings near a strange looking craft.

The craft took off and disappeared as Zamora approached. The next day he noticed scorched earth and broken shrubs at the site. He notified the FBI and the craft was later listed in Project Blue Book files.

Another witness, Sharon Stull, said she was burned and felt ill effects from watching the UFO land. Her doctor said the burns indicate exposure to some type of energy or heat.

The article states that one official said it would be the first verified landing of a UFO and they wanted to get to the site as soon as possible to investigate. However, the article mentions that they were unable to find any balloons or other equipment at the site, leaving them with no knowledge of what Sharon Stull saw at the time.

Pentagon Interested

Socorro Officer Saw Two 
Men Step Out of Big UFO

SOCORRO, April 25 (UPI) - A 
report by a Socorro policeman 
that he saw two men step out of 
a shiny, egg-shaped object that 
landed near here yesterday has 
drawn the interest of the Pen-
tagon.

Officer Lonnie Zamora said he 
saw the object land and then two 
men get out of it. He said the ob-
ject then took off and flew away, 
leaving four 5-inch impressions 
in the ground which he said ap-
peared to have supported a heavy 
object.

Zamora said the object was 
about 15 feet long and about 6 
feet wide and that it was sliver-
ing and aluminum in color. He 
said the landing was in a draw 
about a quarter mile south of 
State Highway 85 and two miles 
south of Socorro.

Zamora said he was on routine 
patrol when he heard an explo-
sion in the area about 5:45 p.m. 
yesterday. He said he drove to 
within 150 yards of the draw 
where he spotted what appeared 
to be an overturned car. 

As Zamora moved closer he 
saw the shiny object on the 
ground. He said two men came 
out of it, looked at him, then got 
back into the object, which then 
took off, rising about 20 feet 
above the ground and then fly-
ing off to the west, rising gradu-
ally. 

"It was scared," said Zamora, 
when he heard the object leave.  
It was going to slow up, I guess. 
Some kind of tiling was coming 
from it, smoke or something. It 
was illuminated, inside, but not 
all the way."

Radio Officer Sargent Chaves 
on his car radio Chaves joined 
him at the site of the apparent 
landing. They found scorched 
earth and four 5-inch impressions 
in the ground which had sup-
ported a heavy object.

The report has drawn the in-
terest of the Pentagon and an 
officer indicated the Air Force 
would make an investigation. An 
Air Force spokesman said some-
one from Washington was being

produces the situation described in the report," Holder said.
Zamora said the craft cleared the area in a matter of a couple of feet as it departed. He lost sight of it within a matter of a couple of minutes, he claimed. 
He noticed the object after investigation in a cloud of dust or smoke about a mile south of Socorro. He was aware of the triangular object in the victim attack and said nothing at first it was a two-story house.
The craft, he said, is in a drawing not visible to the main roads - about 200 yards and thought it was an overturned car. He said the object was about 15 feet long, 6 feet wide, and had a pair of white coveralls, but whether anything was in there was not clear. 
Within 100 Feet
He eventually got within about 100 feet, and it rose about 10-20 feet and left something on the ground, supported by four terraced legs.
Inch depressions were found as well as a couple of tracks about four inches diameter which officers described as might have been made by occupants of the craft. They even went so far as to estimate that the tracks were made by something weighing approximately 1,500 pounds, this the spot where the object supposedly sat. It increased here to exhaust the soil samples and indicated the story was credible.
"Reliable people are seeing incredible things," Lorenze said. "Similar things ha ve happened all over the world and certain details correla te."

WON'T TELL SOUL NEXT TIME
UFO WITNESS SIGHS
AT REPORTS OF WHAT HE SUPPOSEDLY SAID
By CHARLES RICHARDS 
SOCORRO (UPI) - A policeman who gained sudden international attention Friday says he warn an egg-shaped flying object Sunday, but never said what he supposedly said about the incident.
SOCORRO policeman Lonnie Zamora said he would turn around and run, just like he did Friday evening, but never said anything like what has been attributed to him. 
"There have been so many phone calls," he sighed. And most of Sunday he spent thinking over some of the reports of what he supposedly said about the incident.
"Maybe you'd better ask some of these other guys," Zamora told reporters. "I'm the only one who saw it, but they seem to know more about it than I do." 
Denies Seeing Creatures
Zamora denied he had seen any little creatures around the object and said the unusual machine rose off the ground and flew slowly away in a southwesterly direction until it faded out of sight. It never got more than about 20 feet off the ground, he said.
Cpl. John McTigue, an Air Force officer who carried the news dispatch from Kirland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, said reports from Zamora seemed to be more sensational than the officer's own account.
Capt. Richard T. Holder, a Kirtland Air Force Base commander, termed the incident "fantastic" but referred to Zamora as a reliable witness. "Knowing Zamora as we do, we must regard his reports as dependable," he said.

The article discusses an incident that occurred in Socorro, New Mexico, where an Air Force consultant reported seeing an unidentified flying object. The article also mentions that the incident was investigated by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, a consultant on unidentified flying objects, who later returned to Albuquerque.

Text from the document:

UFO Sighting Re-Enacted: NoHelp to Scientist
SOCORRO (AP) - An Airforce consultant on unidentified flying objects had Dr. J. Allen Hynek, consultant, and said after the re-enactment that he could draw no conclusions from what he saw and was "more puzzled than ever" when he arrived here.
Dr. Hynek returned to Albuquerque Tuesday after viewing the site and departed for the East by plane.
Zamora reported seeing an object fly away shortly after 5:45 p.m. Friday. Other reports have followed, including. After the re-enactment, Dr. Hynek said he was puzzled that there was no evidence at the Socorro site. "The story is simply told, certainly without any intent to perpetrate a hoax. The story of course was told by a man who was obviously frightened by what he did see. He said there was evidence at the site.
Is This the Answer?: U.S. Government aircraft flying at low levels along US-66 and US-70-80 taking photographs with powerful electronic flash equipment during the last week, may be the part of the answer to the rash of "flying saucers" seen in New Mexico. The jet airplanes were taking the photos during both night and day, from Albuquerque west to Deming, Ariz., and from Deming west to Casa Grande, Ariz., according to a Kirtland Air Force Base spokesman.

FLYING OBJECT EXPERT CHECKS SOCORRO SCENE
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Astronomer, Takes Photos At UFO Site
SOCORRO, APRIL 29 (AP) - The Albuquerque chief of police said today that an astronomer, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, was photographing the site of what was reported to be a flying saucer landing here on April 24. 
Dr. Hynek said he will determine whether sightings and evidence at the site, about six miles south of here, warrant a conclusion that a flying object landed there.  
Witnesses to the craft said it left deep imprints on the ground and made a scorched earth area of about 50 feet in diameter. 
Dr. Hynek said the soil and stones at the site will be analyzed and the results of the analysis would be made known.
When asked if he thought the object was from outer space, Dr. Hynek said he had no knowledge of any objects that have been seen since the current UFO reports began coming in from New Mexico since April 24.
"I haven't any knowledge of any such objects being seen in New Mexico until now," he said.

hill in Veal found the ground still showing signs of the reported landing after several days.
Authorities found no trace of any air force, army, or other aircraft in the area, he said.
"We are flying objects, but we don't know what they are," Dr. Hynek said. "The Aerial Phenomena Research Organization of which I am director, has been convinced the Socorro policemen and others who saw the objects are reporting sincere observations."
Dr. Hynek said the organization's investigations during the past few days indicate the phenomena appeared to be a silent, hovering, brilliantly lighted craft.
He said the April 24 sighting was explored by Mrs. Lonnie Zamora, who called it the "best documented case in our files."
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the General Services Administration at Clovis Air Force Base said no employees of the port of entry station reported seeing any luminous object last night.
The spokesman said a state policeman Paul Aragon answered a call and said he had seen a flying object.

Information Only (No Case)
Source: FTD
Socorro: MORE FROM NEW MEXICO
Socorro .. A Defense -Chief tain (newspaper of the town) carried these details of the Zamora sighting (April 24, 1964). 
They were on top of this story almost immediately and the follow-up they made was excellent.
He first saw the object from 150 yards. As he drove towards the top of the hill, Zamora said one or two persons at the UFO site saw him. The two persons appeared to be dressed in white coveralls, and at that distance, Zamora said they appeared to be approaching him. The did not take notice of him as he approached.
Zamora continued driving up the hill to get a closer look. 
When he stopped the car on top of the Mesa and directly opposite the place where the UFO had landed, he saw it again, but this time about 50-75 yards away and lower on the hill itself. It seemed about 15-20 feet in diameter and about 7-8 feet high. He saw flames, and dust was flying around the object, but no noise was heard, thinking the object was about to explode. He stopped driving towards it when he saw the flames. 
When the observation occurred, he raised his head and saw the object rise straight up 20 feet. As it rose, the roar changed to a whine and dulled.
Zamora maintained this altitude and moved in a straight line for about 2 miles. Then the UFO gained altitude very rapidly, and soon became a speck in the sky, and disappeared. Four marks in the dirt, about 3-5 more feet, were found where the object had been.
The two legs were probably 2-1/2 to 3 long. On the west side, there was a 12-foot landing hole, on the east the dirt was in a mound 6-7 or more feet. Two round impressions were 4 and 5 inches in diameter respectively.
The newspaper carried a picture taken of the site on the very next day (April 25). The evidence was positively destroyed by the curious, who came in great numbers.
The newsman and APRO were there soon after and reported the incident the same day (April 25). Pictures of the impressions were taken and shown in Paris.
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who visited the site with Zamora, said the object had not been played with but no one's fault, but other witnesses did not agree since J feel that once a sanding object lands it should have been protected.

AMS, BUDGET ($350)
NIGHT LEAD UFOS SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO
APRIL 29, 1964 - ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BOTHERS THE SCIENTIST IS THE LACK OF MENTION OF RADAR CONTACTS IN THE AIR FORCE REPORT. THIS LACK OF INDICATION OF THE RADAR EQUIPMENT IS SAID TO BE RATHER SURPRISING.

DR. TURNER OF NORTHWEST UNIVERSITY CONSULTED BY DR. HYNEK OF NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY ON THIS CASE, EXCLUDING DR. HYNER WHO VISITED THE SOCORRO POLICEMAN LONNIE ZAMORA AT VARIOUS TIMES CONCERNING THE DETAILS.

ANOTHER SIMILAR LANDING NEAR MADORA IN NORTHERN NEW MEXICO WERE SIMILAR TO THAT STATES: ZAMORA AND ANOTHER AT CLAYTON HAVE SAID THAT SEVERAL PERSONS WERE OBSERVING WHAT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN LANDED ABOUT THE SAME AREA ABOUT THAT SAME TIME, BUT THE PEOPLE HAD JUST LEFT THE AREA AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO SEE.

THE SCIENTIST WHO HAS INVESTIGATED MANY SUCH SIGHTINGS BUT USUALLY FINDS MANY CONTRADICTIONS OR OMISSIONS IN THESE REPORTS, SAID THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE CLEAREST REPORTS HE HAS SEEN.

THE LAST PART OF THE REPORT THAT BOTHERS HIM IS WHEN IT STATED THAT ZAMORA DID SEE TWO FIGURES NEAR THE OBJECT AND THEY RAN BACK INTO IT AND IT TOOK OFF. OF COURSE HE WAS TOLD THAT THESE FIGURES APPEARED TO BE SMALL AND HUMANOID BY SOME KIND OF WITNESSES.

LAPAZ RADIATION RELIABILITY UNIVERSITY WAS SUPPORTED BY DR. AND LINCOLN MATIONAL LABORATORY IN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS OF COSMIC RAY PHENOMENA.

I WOULD FIRST POINT OUT THAT WE ARE NOT PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THESE INCIDENTS A SECOND TIME. WE HAVE HAD CONTACTS TODAY AND IN RECENT YEARS ONLY THROUGH WORK AND HE IS A VERY DEPENDABLE OBSERVER.

DR. HYNEK SAID HE FOUND LITTLE AT THE SOCORRO SITE. HE SAID THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE THERE NOW AND NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN TO "SEE" IF THERE'S ANY PARTICLES IN THE ASHES OR AT THE SITE THAT MIGHT BE FOREIGN TO THIS AREA.

DR. HYNEK SAID THAT HIS IMPRESSIONS FROM THE OBSERVATIONS BY ZAMORA AND OTHER AUTHORITIES HAVE IMPRESSED HIM THAT THERE IS LITTLE HERE TO CONFIRM OR DENY ANYTHING TO SEE NOW.

DR. HYNEK SAID THAT LACK OF RADAR CONTACT REPORTS BOTHERED HIM. HE SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE SUCH CONTACT AND THEN CAN TRACE THE OBJECT TO SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA.

Flying Saucer Reports Spread
In New Mexico

New Mexico's perennial addiction to flying saucers has taken hold of the state again with more "objects" reported to have been spotted over various parts of the state.

The latest, which brought out the Air Force and the FBI, was spotted early Sunday morning at La Madera, about 50 miles north of Santa Fe. State Police Captain Ray Shriver said they definitely saw "something there."

Orlando Gallegos of Santa Fe said he and State Police Officer Alfred Crollett within 200 feet of a huge metallic object that looked like an "airplane without wings" and flames spurted silently from numerous jets around the bottom of the object. The object was about 14 feet in circumference, he told police.

A similar report came the same night from a Socorro policeman who said he spotted an object near Socorro Airport. The officer reports the object rose slowly from the ground and then shot away at a tremendous speed "about 20 feet off the ground." The Socorro reports came in about 10 minutes before the La Madera sightings.

In both the Socorro and the La Madera reports, the object was reported to have landed. Additional reports said the objects were about 20 to 30 feet in diameter and left "paw prints, like a mountain lion's" as well as "indentations" in the dirt.

Until the weekend spotting, the most recent UFO sighting in New Mexico came from several motorists including a Las Vegas campus policeman at the University of New Mexico who said they saw a "silvery looking" object. It disappeared over a mountain in the western sky at the same time.
