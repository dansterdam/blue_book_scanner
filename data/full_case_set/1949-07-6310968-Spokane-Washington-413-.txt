11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS  Observer was attracted by a sound similar to a formation of
jet aircraft. The only aircraft he saw was a B-29 heading from
East to West, at an estimated 1000 ft above the B-29, 
traveling in the same direction and at much greater speed he
sighted 8 disc-shaped objects.

A group of birds flying at a much lower altitude than
estimated could have the appearance of large objects traveling
at high speeds and high altitude. It is of my opinion that
this was the case since the pilot of the B-29 had observed
nothing unusual.
