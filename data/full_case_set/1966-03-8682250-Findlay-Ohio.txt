SUBJECT: UFO (US)
ANALYST: MAJOR QUINTANILLA 
PI: BENSON
DATE: 19 APR 66

Analysis was requested on a piece of 35 mm film supposedly exhibiting an unidentified flying object. The film said to have been exposed and processed but no object had been seen on the film. We were unable to find any image on the film due to the fact that the film was completely blank. This blank condition is apparently due to the photographic material having been heavily fogged, possibly due to improper processing or handling. Any attempt to scrutinize the blank film would be futile and would not yield any meaningful information.

The image does not contain any photograph, only text. Based on the text provided in the image, the analysis was performed on a piece of 35mm film that was exhibiting an unidentified flying object. The film had been exposed and processed, but no imagery could be identified, likely due to improper exposure setting or over-extension of the camera's capabilities. The text indicates that despite the film being badly scarred, there did not appear to be any imagery loss due to this factor.
