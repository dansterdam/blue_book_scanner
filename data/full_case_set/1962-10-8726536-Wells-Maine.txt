Transcribing the text:

Departmental of the Air Force 
Headquarters Flying Object Division
Washington 25, D.C.

Date: 20 October 1962
On the evening of October 20th, at approximately 11:30 p.m., a man following a woods road change a small object in flight; a witness was also within a few hundred feet, he told me this morning, of the object as it hovered over a field. The object was described first as a luminous cloud or fog some 30 to 40 feet in diameter, rapidly moving and silent. This object slowed down, hovered, and then shot off at tremendous speed, disappearing in the distance. The witness was terrified, his wife awakened upon his return and found him shocked, bewildered, and reluctant to tell her what he had seen. He then reported the incident to the Air Force Base for investigation. Preliminary interviews of the witness indicate a credible report. The object appeared to be, in some manner, controlled or guided, and its power source and manner of propulsion remain unexplained. I will maintain contact with this witness and continue to investigate this sighting.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely an excerpt from a Project Blue Book report.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The saucer had small lights on the rear. A brilliant light was emitted from the underside and the entire circumference of the craft was outlined by a narrow ribbon of green light. It moved in a north-easterly direction at a point about 90째 from the northern horizon about 50째 from the western horizon. (Moved in a 20째 path from any original position the saucer was northwesterly directed.)

The saucer appeared to dour down and its flight was erratic. It was seen for about 70 seconds. During this period, it appeared to become increasingly brighter. Then it shot straight upward at a steep angle, disappeared. 

I didn't know what this was, but I think some good guess might be:

"A meteoric or satellite

However, the spherical appearance and the constant change in lighting intensity instead of the usual flare up and then fade out typical of meteors, as well as the erratic flight path and sharp vertical departure, render this unlikely. The entire thing was witnessed through an entire atmospheric condition with no doubt as to its reality".

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report discussing the observation of a UFO sighting.

The object appeared to be saucer-shaped and luminous, and it disappeared and reappeared during the sighting. It was observed by multiple witnesses for several minutes. The report describes the object's movements and characteristics in detail.

The text states that the object was sighted approximately 700 yards from the witnesses, and it was estimated to be about 65째 above the horizon. The report provides further details about the object's size, speed, and trajectory.

The image does not contain any photograph or visual element. It is a page of handwritten text from what appears to be a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The text describes an observed aerial object and provides details about the witness's observations.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The record object could be seen on an even or good the whole which was known up to minute contrasting the air its atmosphere. It was apparent that did not come to light could see so unusual and also changed position occasionally.

It would not be possible to determine conditions the object's to the Shown or known factors determine conditions like this also would motion have some kind of substance or something in an upright distinctly noticeable brightly burning or. 

One more point. I'm not sure and this seems so unclear actually notion what was accounted here that many days the same was near clouds on this an objects hovering before it broke disappearance concealed so you suppose they cannot what?

If you send me a Blaine address I could log together to any V.F.O. clubs."
