PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. LOCATION: Southwestern Canada 
2. DATE-TIME GROUP: 3- 5-60 
3. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: D Ground-Radar
4. COURSE: Oss
5. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: Oss  
6. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Ground, orange-orangewatchsmall emitting 
sparks. Appeared to be losing altitude, descending below horizon.
7. COMMENTS: There is no information in which indicates that the observer
identified the object as an aircraft. The description of the object and its
behavior does not coincide with the known characteristics of any conventional
aircraft. The object was observed to be flying at a low altitude and emitting
sparks, which is behavior not typical of conventional aircraft. Therefore, the
conclusion is that the object was an unidentified flying object.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location Southwestern Canada
Date (Local) 24 May 60 Hour (Local) 23:40
Hour (Z Time Group) 2515/02Z
Satellites: (Det 5 ATIG, Ext 3279) ------ Unassessable
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc) Prob meteor

Natural Phenomena (Hail, Lightning, etc) ----------
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. ----------
Other
Evaluation of Source Reliability Prob reliable
Analysis and Conclusions: The object vs the case appears to be a probable meteor, since it disappeared suddenly as meteors do, and the description of the object is consistent with the characteristics of a meteor. The fact that it was observed fora considerable length of time Is not inconsistent with a meteor, as some meteors can be seen for a longer duration depending on their brightness and speed of travel.
