Subject: Possible Indications of Aircraft or Missile Activities in Cenkowan, Korea
TO: AFCIN-HF3, AFCIN-4E4
FROM: AFCIN-HF2
DATE: 6 Feb 1958, COMMENT NR 2

The document discusses various observations and analyses regarding the reported trail, including:
1. The consistent waviness description of the trail indicates it had motion.
2. The flash could not have occurred as high as indicated due to the observer's location behind the ridge.
3. The occurrence was not noted in other areas, indicating it was localized.
4. No specific mention was made, but it can be presumed the observers were not familiar with the type of flare.
5. The trail's disappearance behind a cloud may have meant it extended beyond the cloud.
6. The luminescence of the trail could be due to the low position of the moon or other factors.
7. The flash was too bright to be associated with afterburner reflections, and may have been consistent with a flare for night photography.

1. The reported phenomenon cannot be re-established. Consequently the case is classed as "In-Sufficient Information".

2. The visual sighting which took place at Taegu, Korea on November 6, 1957 reported in your letter dated Nov. 7, 1957 has been investigated and the following information obtained:

The object was observed near Taegu, Korea at approximately 1800 hours local time on November 6, 1957. It was seen by a number of people and was described as a bright luminous object which appeared to be in flight. The object was observed for a period of approximately 15 to 20 minutes. No aircraft or other conventional objects were observed in the area at the time. The object appeared to change direction and altitude during the sighting.

3. Based on the precipitation, it is assumed that this is an observation of a meteor or other natural phenomenon. It is not known if a vapor trail would be left behind unless sufficient information is available regarding the characteristics of the object observed.

The case is filed and closed as "Insufficient Information" since additional details are not available to conclusively identify the reported object.

1. On 6 November 1957, a citizen who desires to remain anonymous, reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object at 0600 hours in the vicinity of Kaisong, Korea.

2. Pursuant to this report, the following investigation was conducted:

a. Civilian Division and Intelligence Personnel interviewed 19 persons who stated they observed the object during the period 0600-0630 hours on 6 November 1957.

b. The witnesses unanimously stated that the object was in view for a period of approximately 30 minutes and that it was spherical in shape, appeared to be metallic, and emitted no smoke or exhaust.

c. The object was reported to have been hovering at an estimated altitude of 2000 feet and to have been completely silent in operation.

d. The object suddenly disappeared from view in a vertical ascent at a very rapid rate of speed.

e. There were no aircraft of any kind in the area at the time of the sighting.

f. The witnesses were reported to be reliable persons, and their testimony was considered credible.

g. That the bright light sighted was probably an extraterrestrial phenomenon consistent with this type of sighting appears probable.

MASCOT FORM A

At approximately 5*00 A.M., 6 November 1957, 19 men located 
in the demilitarized zone of Korea saw a brilliant flash of light 
in the western sky. The flash was described as blue-white, de
veloping into a rod-shaped trail of flame, also ranging from 
1 inch to 18 inches wide, which lasted approximately 30 minutes. 
The flash was visible for about 3 seconds to 3 minutes, varying with observers. A trail of smoke, which was similar to a jet vapor trail, was visible for a jet vapor time.

DEPT. COMP. SEC.

As approximately 0500 6 November 1957, we were operating under the blackout condition, and we had just been relieved from a patrolling mission. It was about this time that we noticed a bright light appear over the hill which was about one and a quarter miles away. It was a like a white flash (flash of bright light) that lasted quite a long while, like 10 to 15 seconds. It looked like some sort of a lighting and seemed to illuminate the whole area. It was not a lightning flash, as that light produced was generally more of a bluish color, and about 100 yards or less in diameter. This object which we saw was much brighter, and the illumination seemed to cover a much larger area, perhaps 500 to 1000 yards in diameter.
It was just about this time that we went to the sandbagged shelter as we were under a blackout condition. The light which we had seen earlier had disappeared and it was very dark. We could see only dimly outlined shadows and could discern no details.
All of us had witnessed this bright light and it is my personal opinion that it was not a lighting flash, but some other type of illumination or object which produced the bright light. I have no idea as to what it could have been, since it did not resemble any type of known aircraft or projectile.

I was with Sgt Ruffin and Pfc Hobbs - had just left a meeting, one of Sgt Ruffin's Sgt Calls (Co M). I noticed that as we left, they got a call on their radio (Sgt Hobbs got the call). They claimed that the radar station (Samdong-ni) had picked up an unidentified flying object. They said the object came down very close to the station, and then shot up again at a terrific speed. You just missed it they said, but it looked very interesting. I asked them what it looked like, but they couldn't describe it very well. They said it was unlike anything they had seen before, and was moving at a fantastic speed - much faster than anything they had ever observed. That's all the information I could get from them. They seemed quite upset and disturbed by the incident, even though they hadn't actually seen the object itself. The report was made to the CO and the I & E Section.

On 6 Nov. 57 at about 1900 hours (7:00 p.m.) local time, Major D.H. and Capt. H.W. while on an aerial reconnaissance over North Korea in an F-84 aircraft, observed a bright white light in the sky. The light appeared to be approximately 15-20 miles distant hovering or suspended motionless at about 5,000 to 10,000 feet altitude. The light was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes. 
During the time of observation, the light appeared to give off a pulsating or flashing effect. No sound was heard and no trail or exhaust was visible. The light then suddenly accelerated and rapidly climbed out of sight, disappearing from view.
No further details available.

Was on patrol main highway Dobo On 6 September at about 0200 - A. M. Standing on road on patrol just talking. Suddenly a bright light came from about 200 yards south. This light was stationary on road on patrol just talking. Actually it seemed to be standing still, making no motion. A white light streak about 10-12 inches long and 1/2 inch wide was seen by all of us. This light streak was traveling very fast from south to north and looked like a streak of white light. This light streak appeared to be traveling at an angle of from about 30 to 45 degrees from the horizontal. As it passed over us we ducked down because we thought it might hit us. PFC Hobbs and Prive Ware discussed the nature of getting considerable light. They still were unable to determine the cause. I waited about 2 minutes then the light changed slow to go back, repeating the same motion, this time from north to south.

The light streak was seen by all of us, appeared to be about 10-12 inches long and 1/2 inch wide, traveling at a very fast speed, at an angle of from 30 to 45 degrees from the horizontal. The light was a streak of bright white light. When it passed over us we ducked down, thinking it might hit us. After about 2 minutes, the light changed and went back, repeating the same motion, this time from north to south.

They passed over the building in a north northeasterly directionand disappeared from sight in about 5 to 8 seconds, I called for the Commanding Officer who was walking from his quarters. I pointed out the objects as they passed overhead. but by that time they had disappeared from sight. 

I could observe the objects clearly and I would estimate they were about the size of a dime held at arm's length and they appeared to be brilliant. Then it faded out.

We had just finished making a security check to PCS by radio when we were advised that something unusual was happening in the vicinity of the radar base at Kunsan Air Force Base.
This light was flashing alternately red and yellow, and located in an area of the perimeter light a brighter flash and complely lost sight. This object was located approximately 1,500 to 2,000 yards elevation and appeared to be larger than a star. The object was observed for approximately 2 minutes, After the brighter light was lost, the object appeared to diminish in size and could be seen for an additional 2-3 minutes. This was a yellow and located in the same area as the flash and cmnletely disappeared. The object was located approximately 15,000 to 20,000 feet elevation and appeared to be larger than a star. This light was observed on and off for approximately 20 to 30 minutes.
I think it may have been a shooting star.

It was an estimated 500-1000 feet in altitude and was a blue-white color and luminous. The object was approximately 50 feet long and 10-15 feet wide. It appeared to be maneuvering and suddenly stopped, hovering silently for about 5 minutes. One end of the object was brighter than the other. After hovering, the object took off at a high rate of speed in the direction of the Northeast and disappeared from sight.

After about 3-5 seconds the light gradually went down and went out. The whole incident did not take more than 10 seconds. It has never happened before or since. About 2-3 weeks later I saw another similar light at about 10 degrees higher in the sky, but it lasted only about 2-3 seconds and disappeared. The magnetic azimuth was about 270 degrees. No sound was heard. No picture could be taken as the incident was so brief. I am willing to verify the above report about this incident.

JOHNSON, BILLY R. PPC. US 27-2-21
Headquarters Company, 76th Battalion, 19th Infantry

One day at OS 211 (OB-2-11) on 6 November 1955 at about 20:00 hrs, the observer, Johnson, was outside where he could observe the terrain and he noticed a bright light, about 6 inches in diameter, coming down from the sky. It came down and hovered about 4 feet above the ground, and then moved around, first to the left, then to the right, then back to the left, hovering all the time, and seemed to be searching for something. It then moved up and down, and back and forth, in an apparent aimless manner, for approximately 5 minutes. Suddenly, it shot up into the sky, going up at a 45 degree angle, and disappeared.

The observer, Johnson, said that the object was about 6 inches in diameter, and was a very bright light, giving off a bluish-white glow. It seemed to be intelligently controlled, and did not appear to be any known aircraft. Johnson said that he had never seen anything like it before, and that it was not a star, planet, or any other celestial body that he was familiar with.

On 6 February, at 0500, C. E. S., a CAA control tower operator at the Chehalis, Washington, airport, observed a luminous oval-shaped object northwest of the airport. The object was first noticed at an estimated elevation of 3,000-4,000 feet, with a hazy aura around it. It was estimated to be about 50-100 feet in diameter and was observed for about 30 minutes and noted that it was clear, distinct, and looked larger than a star. The object apparently did not leave any exhaust trail. The witness reported it did not blink, pulse, or change color. The object disappeared from view going in a northerly direction.  I have no idea what it was, but believe this report may be of interest.

On 6 November at about 0600, I looked at an object or light. It looked at first like a minute, silvery ball, stationary and luminous like green on a dark watch face. It was still dark outside, not daylight. The object, about 4 inches long, moved slowly and steadily to the left, front, without sound and luminous like green on a dark watch face, but could not be seen well at times. Its velocity checked up by my first the object increased speed and took a zig-zag course, first in fast, then a slow zig-zag and finally out of sight. Angle of elevation was about 15-20 degrees. The object was about 15-20 inches long and the width was about 4 inches. Long at a time length. Angle of elevation was about 15-20 degrees.

DATE: NOV 6 1957

On 6 November 1957, at 0500Z, I was advised that a vast, great flash appeared unexpectedly in the eastern sky. It lasted about 10-15 seconds, and illuminated the whole countryside, giving the effect of broad daylight. This had the appearance of very intense lightning, but showed no characteristics of lightning - no noise, no thunder claps - whatsoever. 

The flash, which was estimated to have covered a vast area in the direction of northwest from this area, was followed by the appearance of a light, which appeared to be a very bright one, and which seemed to be "pulsating" - that is, it changed in intensity from bright to dim, and back again, at irregular intervals. This light did not move, remaining constant in relative position in the sky. It remained visible for approximately 30 minutes, when it suddenly disappeared. No other objects visible.

It cost 2 as they say to go out and attempt to trace in any way and get to the object itself but it was decided not to take any action as it cost money and they did not have enough evidence to go further. They reported this to the higher headquarters from the coast guard but was told the investigation would be closed and not traced any further as the object itself was not recovered or traced to any landing location or identified.
Very plain for minutes was rather unusual for this time of the year and the winds were rather steady and calm during the whole time the object was in sight and disappearance. It seemed to be going to northwest. It ceased to be going to northwest. It seemed to be going northwest - it ceased tc be going in that direction.

The image appears to contain a photograph, but no identifying information about any humans. The photograph shows a blurry, dark object that looks like it could be a unidentified flying object (UFO). The text in the document describes a sighting of an object that had unusual characteristics, such as emitting a "greenish hue" and "intense glow".

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

GONZALEZ, Geronimo P. 60 ELECAVAT-23308
DMZ Company, 1st Cavalry Division
One 6 November as 0500, I was walking with a patrol into the DMZ area south of Kum Songi-Ri. At approximately 0530 hours, SSG. MONTEZ, No. 7 Patrol member, discovered an object directly behind one of the rice paddy dikes, glowing with an intense orange-red light. This light was of such intensity that the whole area in the immediate vicinity was illuminated. The light lasted for approximately 5-10 seconds, then subsided to a greenish hue. The object then began to rise vertically and silently to an estimated altitude of 800-1000 feet. The object then took on the appearance of a white sphere about the size of a basketball and moved in a southerly direction at a high rate of speed, climbing at a 70 degree angle. The object had completely disappeared in about 5 seconds. The only sound heard was a slight whistle, like that of a bullet passing nearby. The object was observed by 6 other members of the patrol.

The report states that a drawing accompanying the description was attached, but no image is shown in the provided document.

ATIC 

KEYS, Daniel D., Sgt. RA 17401567
1952 (Germany) Int. Cavall. Division

Time - 0500, 6 November 52 (pickup point at 0212

Visibility - slight overcast - very dark - stars visible - very few clouds - reasonably clear.

Vision - suddenly a bright flash caught my attention and lasted about 2 seconds - the flash was silent. No sound of any kind. It appeared to be a bright greenish white vapor trail with definite form - much like the trail left by a jet but without the characteristic of a jet. The trail was horizontal and straight - no curves at all. It seemed to come down rapidly from a high altitude and then disappear - no trace of it remaining. I watched closely for any further activity but saw nothing like it again. No kind of aircraft was observed. I'm at a loss to describe exactly what it was that I saw. It remained distinctly visible only about 2 seconds and then was gone. Observed that it was of little or no width at the beginning expanding to a width of perhaps 6 inches at the end - rapidly disappearing as it died out. It did not fade but simply disappeared completely.

AIRFILE: Jack R., PFC, US 23375210 
1957 Genzano, LS CAVALRY Division 
AG 00365-62 

I was on the road about 1:15 A.M. on a bright, clear night. I saw a bright light up ahead of me. At first I thought it was a car, but as I got closer, I could see it was not. The light was 50 to 75 feet across and about 30 feet off the ground, hovering above the road. As I approached it, the light appeared to be rotating counterclockwise and moving very slowly from east to west. The light was so bright that I had to shade my eyes in order to see it clearly. It seemed to be traveling from west to northeast because my trail was coming from southeast. As it moved, it would occasionally disappear, then reappear a short distance away. This happened several times, as though it were going in and out of clouds, although the sky was clear. It gave off a very bright light for perhaps 5 or 6 seconds, then it would dim to a dull glow and almost disappear, then brighten up again. This cycle was repeated several times while I watched it. The light did not appear to be attached to anything, and I could not hear any sound from it. It was at about the same level the entire time I watched it, and seemed to be hovering. After I had watched it for about 5 minutes, it suddenly shot up into the sky at a tremendous speed and disappeared.

DATE: Company APO 85, 6 November 1957 - DATE: The above referenced report is submitted herewith:
At approximately 0200, 6 November 1957, I was standing outside OF 207, Barracks when I observed a very bright flash, all around the OF. The flash was very bright and seemed to illuminate the area. After a few seconds the light disappeared.
(Map) 232 - position and as an elevation of 60-. The flash appears to have originated about 500 meters south-southeast of our position and as an elevation of 60-. The flash appeared to be on or slightly above the ground and lasted for about 15 minutes. I could not see the thing like it, but the area in the direction of the flash seemed to be illuminated as though something had ignited there.
It did not appear to be anything like aircraft, meteor, or other normal known phenomena. The object did not leave anything behind and I could hear no sound associated with it. It just appeared very bright, lit up the area, and then disappeared.

I was one OF (Oslist) OF 3 at about 0500, 6 November 1957, at Kaisong, Korea, for about 3 minutes. After telephoning at 0550, about 2 minutes later, I reported in to my Company and did not see any object. It was a clear night, I pointed the vapor out to me, though it was some kind of light, it had the same appearance of that of the bright light trailing off to the right. 

I was about 150 feet in length, and about 25 inches in length, tight, and the angle of about 45 degrees to the left, it seemed to be quite still and the light was very bright, I could not actually see any object, it was a clear flight,

There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this document. This appears to be a typed text document containing a detailed description of an observed flash of light in the sky over Korea on November 6, 1957. The text describes the visual characteristics and duration of the observed phenomenon.

Text from the document:

At approximately 5:00 A.M., 6 November 1957, 19 men located in the demilitarized zone of Korea saw a brilliant flash of light in the Western sky. The flash was described as blue-white, developing into a red-orange trail of flame, size ranging from 1 inch to 12 inches when held at arms length. The flash was visible for from 1 second to 3 minutes, varying with observers. A trail of smoke, which was similar to a jet vapor trail, was seen behind the flash, or trail of flame, and was visible for as long as 30 minutes.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Intelligence, 33rd Air Division
IR-7-57
PAGE 1 of 1 PAGES

This report is submitted by the Radar Chief of the 33rd Air Division. It describes an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting over Korea. The report states that the object was detected on radar and was observed visually by members of an RB-50 crew. No photographs are included in this document.

The text of the document is as follows:

"Intelligence, 33rd Air Division 
IR-7-57
PAGE 1 of 1 PAGES

1. SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon

This report is submitted by the Chief Radar Intelligence Officer, 33rd Air Division. This report is submitted in accordance with the requirements of AFR 200-2. The incident was observed over Korea on 24 August 1957.

2. Detailed Description of Phenomenon: On 24 August 1957, at approximately 2015Z, the aircraft commander of an RB-50 aircraft (call sign B-56) reported a light that appeared to be an aircraft in the vicinity of the aircraft's position. The light appeared to be at a high altitude and was moving rapidly in a northerly direction. The RB-50 crew maintained visual contact with the light for approximately 15 minutes and plotted its position on the pilot's map.

3. Ground Radar Contact: The ground radar station at K-11, Korea, also detected the object on radar and tracked it for approximately 30 minutes. The object was observed to travel at an estimated speed of 2000 knots.

4. Description of Object: The object appeared as a bright, steady light, moving at a high rate of speed. No other details were observed by the crew.

5. Conclusions: This incident is considered to be an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The object was tracked on both airborne and ground radar and observed visually by the crew of the RB-50 aircraft. Its high speed and altitude are indicative of a probable aircraft or missile. However, its unusual movement and lack of other identifying characteristics preclude a positive identification.

6. Recommendations: It is recommended that this report be forwarded to higher headquarters for further evaluation and analysis."

AIR INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION RECORD
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT NUMBER: 28-57
DATE: 12 Dec 57
SUBJECT: SIGHTINGS OF AIR VEHICLES, INTELLIGENCE DIVISION
VALIDITY OF INFORMATION: RELIABLE
FULFILLMENT OF REQUIREMENT: PARTIAL
THE PRIME FACTOR (I.E. APPROXIMATELY 50 WITNESSES, ALL MILITARY OBSERVERS) THAT WOULD GENERALLY PROVIDE AN UNQUESTIONABLE RELIABILITY OF INFORMATION, ALSO INDICATES THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO PROPERLY ANALYZE AND EVALUATE THIS REPORT. FOR EXAMPLE:
1. DESCRIPTIVE OF ESSENTIAL DATA, BUT WITH OCCASIONAL CONFLICTING STATEMENTS OF THE UNIT, TIME, DATE, OR EXACT LOCATION, WHICH REQUIRE 20 MINUTES CORRELATION AND VERIFICATION.
2. COUPLED WITH THE ABOVE, IS THE INABILITY TO CONDUCT AN "ON THE SPOT" INVESTIGATION, FOLLOW-UP OF SURVEYS IN THE AREA OF THE UFO SIGHTING AND PROBABLE ORIGIN.
3. HOWEVER, THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY DATA DERIVED FROM DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE AGGREGATE SIGHTINGS ARE CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT TO THE CONCLUSION GIVEN:
A. HIGHLY IMPROBABLE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF BALLOON TYPES AS THE OBSERVED PHENOMENA BASED ON THE UNUSUAL MANEUVER CHARACTERISTICS (FOR GENERAL FLIGHT TYPES) WOULD OCCUR AT ALTITUDES BETWEEN 50,000 TO 120,000 FEET. THE LUMINOSITY OF THE FLIGHT PATH WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 10 TIMES BRIGHTER THAN THE FULL MOON.
B. APPARENTLY NOT A FIREBALL OR A METEORITE. CONSISTING OF NUMEROUS AND SIMULTANEOUS SIGHTINGS AT THE OBJECT PASSES OUT THESE BODIES, AS WELL AS HIGH-VELOCITY MANEUVER CAPABILITIES AND ALTITUDE CAPABILITIES. IT DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN OBJECT HAVING CONTROL OR NAVIGATION.
C. OBJECT APPARENTLY WAS NOT A PISTOL FLARE OR A JET AIRCRAFT AFTERBURNER, MILITARY OBSERVERS WHO STOOD CLOSEST AT THE UFO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE FORMER.

STORY

The image contains text that describes an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. The key points are:
1. A "flash" (which could be the UFO) is reported as such, but the "UFO" is described as a "trail" by others.
2. There was no sound, which would generally rule out a high-speed jet aircraft.
3. The object was localized within a specific area.
4. The object's stopping and starting motion is described as characteristic of a ground-launched missile or rocket, rather than an aircraft.
5. Due to limitations and difficulties, the UFO cannot be conclusively identified. It will be treated as "UNKNOWN", pending receipt of further information or data that may shed some light on the incident.

SUBJECT: Possible Indications of Aircraft or Missile Activities in Communism Korea
TO: (1) AFCIN-HF2*
(2) AFCIN-H3
(AT JCRC)
1. Attached UFO report is forwarded for your review in accordance with existing procedures regarding documents which may indicate information of value to foreign aircraft or missiles.
N.K. It is believed that this UFO appears to have been in the vicinity of Kaisong, US military observers believe was observed by approximately 30 observers.
2. A preliminary analysis of the data in the observers reports more or less rules out meteors, fireballs, and the Soviet satellite orbital tracks. The long duration of the object(s) and information as revealed by a combination device indicates that the object was at very high altitudes and its motion faster than that to be expected of conventional devices.
3. The evaluation and comment of each Division hereon would be appreciated.
Your attention is invited to suspend data given this office.
