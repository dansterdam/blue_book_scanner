Text from the document:

"Friend: Foley Minot, N. D.
Subject: Foley, N. D.

This is a very and explicit novel about the 30 of December, when I saw three objects fly over my farm at approximate 8 p.m. They were flying very high and silent in the direction of North West. They seemed to be circular or round in shape and very bright. I watched them for about 2 minutes as they flew over my farm at a very fast rate. The objects were silver or white in color and were giving off a bright glow. It seemed as though the objects were about 1/2 mile high. I believe the objects were intelligently controlled and not just some natural phenomenon. I have never seen anything like this before. It seemed very strange and I cannot explain it. I am a very reliable, truthful person and I know what I saw that night. If you have any other questions I will be glad to cooperate and help explain the sighting. Please do not use my name in any reports as I wish to remain anonymous. I hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you need any clarification or additional details."

Transcription of the text in the image:

"It is rather did a shadows in the sky. 
About the size of the stars about the way of deg relates to distance. 
No 1, and 2 were much larger. 
About like a teal or less. It move very fastly, faster than weather planes. Much further away than I judge the stars. 
When it moved and the stars came around it was beautiful.
This is the best a can make and hope it helps someone."
