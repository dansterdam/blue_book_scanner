22 august 1961

Dear * * * * *

Your letter of August 22 and addressed to the NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA has been referred to this office for attention. The information you Furnished, while of interest, does not contain sufficient details to warrant further investigation at this time.

In order to attempt an objective evaluation of your sighting, I would need additional information. For example, description of the object or objects observed, time, date, and location of the sighting, weather conditions, number of witnesses, and any other pertinent details. You may return this information to me if you so desire. 

Your interest in this subject is appreciated.

Sincerely,

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

"it was definitely not a aircraft of any kind. The shape was like of a disk or saucer as described from many reports of what is called flying saucers. the object was hovering above the ground as to my best estimate 50 to 75 feet up. It was moving at a very slow rate of speed, probably 10 to 15 miles per hour. At no time did it make any noise such as a jet engine or propeller aircraft. The estimated diameter of the object was approximately 35 to 40 feet. The color appeared to be a dull gray or metallic in nature. It was a clear night and there were no clouds in the sky. I observed this object for a period of approximately 2 to 3 minutes before it accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight going in a northerly direction."

The investigation shows
that the report of the

The sighting cannot be
satisfactorily explained.
It is recommended further
that the file be closed as
it appears to be insuffi
