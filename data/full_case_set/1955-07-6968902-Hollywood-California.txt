CONFIDENTIAL
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight 1-G, USAFE ATIS
Enclosure #1, Part Three, Report #10-AICB-10-55, Statement of Albert J. DeLorge

While facing north I noticed a bright object high in the sky traveling east. The object was observed for about 15 seconds and seemed to be flying at a tremendous speed and was completely silent. The object appeared to be about twice the size of a jet aircraft and was a brilliant white in color, reflecting the sun's rays. The body which was luminous while in flight fell to the ground and there was no smoke trail.
