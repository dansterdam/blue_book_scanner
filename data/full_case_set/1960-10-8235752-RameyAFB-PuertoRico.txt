"THE ITEM FIZIK» FROM CIIOCT CAXHQKVNX COMPARED AT 310 MJf.
The cxeminatlon of the material wss compared to 1932 Intelligence data, and a report vas prepared giving the details of the comparison. The results of this comparison indicated that the material consisted of a type of metallic rook or alloy, which was silvery-whi .e in color and in general appearance resembled other known meteorite specimens. The physical and chemical analyses made of the material confirmed the fact that it possessed properties that are normally associated with meteorites. 
The availability of reliable data, as to the origin of this type of material, is somewhat limited. However, the conolusions in this case is that this material is of meteorological origin."

Dear [REDACTED],

This letter is in response to your report of an unidentified flying object. We have carefully investigated this matter and find that the object you described is most likely a [REDACTED].

While we appreciate you taking the time to report this incident, we must inform you that [REDACTED]. We understand the public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena, but our investigation has determined that this particular case does not warrant further action.

Please let us know if you have any other information that could shed light on this matter. We remain committed to thoroughly examining all reports of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,
[REDACTED]

Dear Director,

There is some new development on the project mentioned your office. The material we sent sample to you has been subjected to various tests which gave rather unusual results. I shall be pleased to discuss these with you further if you so desire.

We were at this city yesterday and had a chance to discuss the matter with ----- and he was able to clarify some points which were rather obscure. We all thanked because of his assistance -- he has been most cooperative.

So far there is nothing further to report, please send me any comments or suggestions you may have.

Sincerely yours,

My dear Mr. Beckworth:

I have been requested by reply to your letter of January 22, 1953 concerning certain matters referred to therein. 

This matter is receiving the attention of the Department of the Air Force. The details you request are not immediately available, however, and it will take some time to compile the necessary data and give you the information you desire. We will give this matter our prompt attention and will advise you as soon as possible as to the results of our investigation.

Honorable Harry Bartwright,
House of Representatives,
Dear Sir:

The department of the Army has referred to me a copy of your letter dated 15 February 1950, in which you requested information concerning the recovery of an object near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947.

The Department of the Army has advised this office that all files and records pertaining to the Roswell, New Mexico, incident have been transferred to the custody of the Air Force. However, this office has no information in its files that would indicate the recovery of any object near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947. The files of this office contain no data that would substantiate the reports of the recovery of an unidentified object in that area.

Your request for information has been noted, and should any data come to the attention of this office that would be relevant to your inquiry, you will be promptly advised.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
Captain, U.S. Air Force

MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF, COUNTERINTELLIGENCE DIVISION, USAF
ATTN: MAJOR HECTOR QUINTANILLA

SUBJECT: Reference Your Case UB109

The following is a recommended reply for your proposed inquiry, based on information received regarding the sighting of an unidentified aerial object on 24 October 1950:

Dear Congressman Beckworth:

We have received your inquiry on behalf of Mr. [REDACTED] regarding the sighting of an unidentified aerial object on the evening of 24 October.

Also attached are quite certain that Mr. [REDACTED]'s report, based on information received from Carswell Air Force Base, indicates the object sighted was a USAF balloon. The AISO officials, incidentally, are unable to confirm this conclusion absolutely, they do consider the circumstances as described by your constituent to be consistent with the reported observance of a balloon.

While we regret the inconvenience to your constituent, we trust this clarification of the facts underlying his report is responsive to your inquiry.

2. Letter dated 1 January 1952 addressed to the Headquarters of the Hesperia Foundation, New York, N. Y. concerning the UFO sighting.

2* The general path of the object, as seen £roa Cape Canaveral, vould carry it to the south of the location of the sighting. A rear reflection in this direction is evident in this sighting.
3. The object observed at Cape Canaveral appeared at 21354:, 8 iiinutes and 7 seconds after the launch of Pioneer 5 missile fro» Cape Canaveral on 11 March 1960. Pioneer 5 was launched at 21346, and this object is sufficient to have accounted for this small launch in time.
4. Due to the availability of reliable data, it is believed that the conclusion in this case is firm and definite.
