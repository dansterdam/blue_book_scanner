Shiny white starlike objs w/red dot attached fm it. Looked a little earlier sighted objs which were determined to be balloons. Single reported was probably due to condensation formed when it burst. The light which is mut on balloons after sun set. Sun had set but due to height of balloon it was probably still in sunlight. Red light was probably the anti-collision light which is mut on balloons after sunset.

The handwritten text states:
"We were looking out of the bedroom window when all of a sudden a bright star appeared, and the object looked around for a while and then seemed to disappear. I got my binoculars and looked at it with binoculars as it seemed to rise upward and move in a lateral direction at a very fast rate of speed. It left a trail behind it that looked like about a 40x (forty power) binocular view. It was about 8:30 P.M. and the sky was clear."

At a little after 9:00 P.M. on August 4, 1961, the witness saw the most startling phenomenon he had ever witnessed. The witness was out in his back yard when he noticed a flash of light in the eastern sky. He watched as the light moved in a horizontal direction, then started to move up and down rapidly. The light seemed to increase and decrease in size as it moved up and down. It then seemed to stop momentarily, and then started to zig-zag back and forth. The witness said the zig-zag motion was very fast, and the light seemed to change colors, going from white to red to blue. After a few minutes, the light seemed to start fading, and then suddenly disappeared. The witness said he was greatly puzzled by what he had seen, and had no explanation for the strange light in the sky. He said he had never seen anything like it before, and that it was a most unusual and startling experience.

The author appears to be reporting the incident and providing some details about what was observed.

Dear Sirs:

About a year and a half ago I reported seeing a white, partly transparent object in the sky with a red dot in the middle which my six-year-old daughter observed as well. It appeared to be hovering or moving slowly at an extremely high altitude. The object which was sighted by several people in the area was oblong in shape and seemed to have a metallic appearance. The sighting occurred on the night of August 25, 1951. I had collected several names of people who had also seen the object, but due to the time lapse, I am unable to recall the exact number.

The balloon-shaped object apparently hovered or moved very slowly at an extremely high altitude for over an hour. The object practically faded from view as the night progressed. My wife's observation was that it seemed to be a balloon of some sort, but the motion and altitude did not seem compatible with a balloon. In fact, a balloon could have caused quite a bit of noise, which was not the case. The object had a metallic, shiny appearance and did not seem to be illuminated from the interior. 

I am taking a picture with my camera - which does not have

Some previous and rather scattered information on the subject - some of which apparently supplied. I may this is because written to a military organization and some information sought to be withheld - or the witness does not wish to identify himself. (My brother and a friend say they saw the object - so it maybe the witness does not wish to identify himself or other interested parties).

I am writing my observations where one or two came and I would like to get some confirmation of yours as well. Please send me one - I would like to display it as part of this file. If you can accommodate my request please advise me, or perhaps I should submit it to headquarters for their records.

A postclip I am forwarding, which may be of interest.

Sincerely yours,

About a year and a half ago I reported seeing a white, partly translucent object which passed through my six inch reflecting telescope. It appeared to be oblong in shape, though it appeared to be the naked eye about the size of a jumbo marshmallow. This incident occurred near Wilmington, Delaware on the August 13, 1961, lunar eclipse. I would certainly know that they balloon through a telescope, there might not have been any visible details other than its shape. About the only thing I can say with certainty is that if it was a balloon, I would have know what it was since a balloon is the only explanation I know that would fit this sighting.

* I was taking a picture with my camera-which doesn't have time exposures and thus I obtained no picture - when the object appeared. And since apparitions are notoriously hard to photograph, there was little Chance I would have gotten a picture even if my camera had had time exposures.

I am writing this ninth-grade theme on flying saucers and would like to use the information from your investigation project on the Air Force saucer * investigation. Thank you.

Perhaps I should say unidentified flying object instead of saucer.

Sincerely yours,

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force investigation of UFO sightings. The document describes the sighting of an "Unidentified Flying Object" on August 25, 1961 in Wilmington, Delaware.

The text in the document is as follows:

Project Bluebook
Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson AFB
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sirs:

We would like to report the sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object. On the night of Friday, August 25, 1961, at about 8:00 P. M. EDT, we sighted a bright object in the West-Northwest section of the sky. It was a little bit lower in altitude than Arcturus was and it was about 3 or 4 times the difference in altitude of the two bodies, so the west. (Since it was too light for Arcturus to be easily seen, the position of Arcturus is approximate.)

It looked like a bubble with a orange crescent (Probably the reflection of the sun).

The preceding paragraph described the object as seen through a 6" reflecting telescope at 40 power. All of the following was observed:

At about 8:07 P. M. it exploded. Without visual aid, "the object seemed to explode, shooting out into many pieces, making a small amount of what appeared to be smoke. The exploded objects (with the naked eye) appeared to be still. They gradually faded out and were invisible after about 10 minutes. The explosion itself was not seen through the telescope as we were trying to take a picture through the telescope at the time.

If it is possible for you to give us a positive explanation of this, please do so.

Very truly yours,

[Redacted]

P. S. The pictures did not turn out due to insufficient light.

This page does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a form or questionnaire related to the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Text extracted from the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

This object was seen in the daytime.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object, and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

It looked like a circular white object in the sky. It looked about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. It did not move or do anything out of the ordinary. It just sat in one place in the sky.
