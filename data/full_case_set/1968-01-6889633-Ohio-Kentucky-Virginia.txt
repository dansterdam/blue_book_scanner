AT WHAT TIME DID THIS INCIDENT OCCUR?
At about 2:0 minutes until 5 a.m., 3 just sat down in the car. OO's 442 HARDTOP 58 MODEL, started the engine and about the time turned 6 the light to brake before turning to the right to head off towards the end of the street. I turned off the ignition and went out and watched until I had to run down or up the street (east) to put it in view. It was so close that it was about to pass a story and a half house (1st frame) across the street from one.
I watched it until it disappear over the trees from me. The most significant in this direction of Cincinnati.
After I alighted a really and it seemed to me that they didn't even have been traveling on the same direction as IR 72 and I believe that the distance was more from one, something like Springfield to Cincinnati.
I am sure that if you would find some one that was passing by south east on IR 72 and both between 4:40 AM they should be able to give you a good and length description of it, that was so natural and peculiar, although approaching it with a high speed, but the Dayton Pike and the I-75 are near by.
Respectfully reporting

Memo for the record
Sighting of 27 Jan 68
Tele phone conversation of 1 Feb 68
Mr. [ REDACTED ] have gotten photos of the obj. At first Mr. [ REDACTED ] thought the photos were the result of static electricity. However because of the coincidence that the plates are for the correct time period; that static usually occurs on more than just two plates and that there was a bright object sighted by two of the guards, he is no longer sure that the plates are of static. The biggest reason that Mr. [ REDACTED ] thought the plates were of static is that the two pairs of plates should overlay if the photos are of meteor or of a satellite re-entry. Mr. [ REDACTED ] said that he would give us a written statement of the occurrence if we requested it. He also said he would give the two guards, [ REDACTED ] and [ REDACTED ], // if we sent them to him.
The photos have been forwarded to Dr. Mcgroarty at the Smithsonian but Dr. [ REDACTED ] will have copies sent to us.

Talked to Mr. Haraf of the Smithsonian. Mr. Haraf stated that the obj. is not a controlled satellite recovery but that the obj. could be a meteor.

Also talked to Mr. Wadsworth of the Univ. of Colo. The direction of the obj. was roughly toward the Ed and had a duration of approx. one min.

Wallops Island meteorological station has a photo and a spectrum of the obj. There were reports from Raleigh N. C.

(At first I thought I saw a strange object hovering in the sky which appeared to be oval shaped and seemed to reflect light. The object was silent and seemed to remain stationary or at least make no great speed. It quickly disappeared into the distance and I could no longer see it. The night was clear with some scattered clouds. The object appeared to be a bright, shiny white in color, not pulsating and seemed to move slowly upwards and disappearing into the distance. I watched it for a period of approximately 3 minutes. There were no blinking lights or sound and it appeared to be at a high altitude. The object appeared to be silent and larger than a normal aircraft. I could not determine the exact size or make out any distinct features. It seemed to just hover silently and then quickly disappear.)

The object appeared to be close to us, approximately 1/2 mile. The object seemed to be oblong in shape and bright white in color not pulsing. It made no sound and appeared to hover silently for several minutes before disappearing into the distance. I could not determine the size or make out any distinct features. The night was clear with scattered clouds. The object did not resemble any normal aircraft, meteor or celestial object. It just appeared to hover silently before disappearing. The object appeared to travel in an upward direction at a moderate speed before disappearing from sight. I could not determine the altitude of the object.
