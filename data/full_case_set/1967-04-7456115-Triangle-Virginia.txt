Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It seemed to just fade away and it went straight up

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   Yes   (No)   Don't Know.   If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):   (Yes)   No   Don't Know.   If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Nothing Heard
b. Color - Bright, yellowish-green with an inside circle or trail

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
If I had done that it would have shown the object was probably much smaller than it actually appeared through the little branch

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the others that you can such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[A hand-drawn sketch is provided showing a triangular object with an arrow pointing to the right.]
