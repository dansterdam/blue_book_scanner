TO: 25 Air Div (SAGE)
1. In accordance with APR 200-2, R 7 APR 60, the attached correspondence is forwarded for information and action.
2. From the details of the 8 July 62 incident, it is evident that a flight of 2 - 3 high performance aircraft was observed in the vicinity of Bremerton, Washington. According to these civilian sources, this incident was considered unusual by a McCHord Airstaft who had just landed at the field. It is also reported that the object unquestionably in his mind was a shooting star. Additional information on this subject is contained in the same vicinity at the same time and he also thought that it was a shooting star.
3. In view of the above, no further investigation was made, nor was a report submitted in accordance with APR 200-2.
4. As our response to the article in the Seattle Times our records do not reveal any such story and a check with the Seattle Times information desk in Seattle confirms that no such article has been published in that paper during the past year.

Your letter of October 30, concerning UFO and other strange airborne objects in the Seattle area is acknowledged. We will be glad to investigate any further sightings that you may have, and to add this case to our files.

As for your two sightings on October 23, the details given indicate this was probably some type of aircraft, not an unusual object. If any new details come to light that might change this conclusion, please let me know, and I will again make an investigation.

Thank you for your interest.

Yours truly,

I am a seahonors at Inkrkakam High Schooi, and I am extremely interested in unidentified rying objects (UFOs). I have talked with a friend on the subject whose opinion I respect. 

I have investigated the subject through books and magazines. I know the history of unidentified flying objects and that many qualified observers have reported seeing them. I am concerned to find out more about them.

I recall reading in the Seattle Times recently that more sightings have been reported recently over Washington State, but that the Air Force has been unable to explain them. They have no known answers, although efforts have been made.

I would be extremely interested in your views or opinions as to whether these UFO's could be interplanetary vehicles.

Very truly yours,
[Signature redacted]
