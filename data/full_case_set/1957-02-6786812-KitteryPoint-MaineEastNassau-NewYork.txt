AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
NEW HAMPSHIRE
UNCLASSIFIED
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Report
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 18 March 1957
DATE OF REPORT: 19 March 1957
OBSERVER: Capt. USAF, 8608th Movement Control Squadron, Portsmouth, N.H.
LOCATION: Kittery Point, Maine, and East Nassau, New York
DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:
Observed an unidentified flying object report. The object was first observed at about 2015 hours, 18 March 1957, by the observer who was watching a celestial body which he took to be the full Moon. The object was observed for approximately 3 minutes.
The object was initially seen in the northeast, but moved downward and to the observer's right as he watched it. The object appeared yellowish-orange in color and gave off a brief flash of light as it moved downward. When the observer first saw the object, it appeared to be the size of a basketball at arm's length. As it moved downward, it appeared to decrease in size. The object moved downward and to the right at a steady pace, appearing to the observer to be descending. The entire observation lasted approximately 3 seconds. Mr. Condic hurried to the corner, but the object had disappeared.
The observational data indicates the possibility of a fireball-type meteor. More or less fireball-like objects are included in the hope of obtaining added information of value.
DISTRIBUTION: As directed.

6. The observers were Mr. and Mrs. Brave Boat Harbor Road, Kittery, Maine.  
7. Weather: Mr. and Mrs. described the night as cold, dark, and with no stars or moon visible, although their home is frequently lighted at night, and moonlight normally exists.
8. Portsmouth Air Weather Detachment, 25th Weather Group, gave the following information: Wind velocity, 5-10 knots, Wind direction, 250-260 degrees, Visibility, 10-15 miles, altocumulus and cirrostratus clouds, 10,000 feet - 30,000 feet.
9. N/A
10. Negative.
11. Knowledge of UFOB first brought to the attention of the 100th Bomb Wing at Lincoln, Nebraska on 9 March 1957 - Date of investigations, 9 March 1957 and 13 March 1957.
12. Photographs of sere where the object landed.
13. Statements of Observers:
Mrs. related she was out in the yard on the south side of her house looking down her washing line over to the southeast. The object appeared in the northeast and rapidly came toward her, glowed with a very bright colored light and about the size of a softball surrounded by a very bright glowing white light which illuminated the yard around. The object seemed to almost stop in its course and then dropped quickly and did not rise or leave any small light or residue. It appeared brighter than moonlight. The object was described as a large round dark colored body with a brighter light around the center and no noise or exhaust was observed. It appeared to angle down after passing overhead of the observers. It appeared to be the same color and shape as it came in and went out of view. It was a cold, dark night with no wind blowing.

The hole edge looked like it had been made with fire or soft coal. The hole appeared to have been made at an angle, with the object approaching from the northeast direction. The object was spherical, silver in color, and apparently about 250 degrees in size. As it approached, it descended to within 2-3 feet of the ground, then climbed to an estimated 1000 ft., crossed over another swamp pond adjacent to the northwest of the pond where the hole was located, then descended rapidly and disappeared in the vegetation on the far bank of the swamp pond.
The dogs appeared to be unhappy and whined and this appeared to be because of the bright flash of light within the head which attracted their attention. Mrs. H--- and her son returned to the hole in the bog and upon close observation they noticed a ring of indentations around the hole, approximately 18 inches in diameter.
Mr. H---apparently cut a hole in the ice and gently touched the object with a fishing pole. He stated that it appeared to be very hot and a reading of 50 to 70 beats directly over the hole.
One mile Mr. X--- related that he was traveling northeast in his car on Haley road about 0830 hours when he saw a bright light hovering over the treetops about 1000 yards distant. The light did not appear to have any particular color other than that of a brilliant flash. It seemed to flare up and then disappear for some seconds and then reappear. This occurred for 5 or 6 times during the 3-4 minute period of the observation. Mr. X--- stated that it was a bright moonlight night.
On 17 March 57, the investigation team went to Cape Anthony, Cape Bluff, 7/54 Sat, McNeil, and 3/54 Jack visited the pond where the object supposedly fell. Examination of the pond showed no disturbance of the water or ice and no trace remained of the hole described by Mr. and Mrs. H---.
On 13 March 57, the investigation team again visited the pond where the object supposedly fell with a geiger counter and found that the highest reading recorded on the geiger counter was 1/100 of a milliroentgen. The investigation team is of the opinion that this reading was indistinguishable from normal background radiation and indicates that no radioactivity above normal remained over the top of the house and disappeared behind the trees. Mr. and Mrs. H--- could not be located to be questioned further regarding the sighting.
In conclusion, the investigation took place 30 days after the sighting. Mr. and Mrs. H--- were unavailable to be questioned and the object could not be found. It appears that this sighting is one of the unreliable type and should be classified as an UNKNOWN.
