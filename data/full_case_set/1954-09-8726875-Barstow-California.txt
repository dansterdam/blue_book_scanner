FLIGHT ADVICE - Report of Observations: On 1 January 1954 at approximately 1330 hours, I was flying low over the desert area near Barstow, California. I observed a number of small objects traveling at a very high rate of speed and altitude. The objects were approximately 10 feet in length and 4 feet in width. They appeared to be metallic in nature and reflected the sunlight. The objects moved in a random pattern, abruptly changing direction and altitude. At one point, 3 of the objects came together and then separated, continuing on their random paths. The objects were observed for approximately 15 minutes before they disappeared from view. I was unable to identify the objects and have no explanation for their origin or purpose.
