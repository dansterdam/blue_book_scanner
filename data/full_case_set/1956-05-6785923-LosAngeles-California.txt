The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a Project 10073 Record Card with information about an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. The card provides details about the sighting, including the date, location, observer, description of the object, and conclusions. Based on the information on the card, there is no doubt that this sighting was determined to be an astronomical phenomenon, specifically the planet Venus.
