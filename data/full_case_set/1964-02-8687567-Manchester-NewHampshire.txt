There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The document provides detailed photographic data about a particular case, including the make of the camera, the film size, speed, and exposure information. It also mentions additional miscellaneous information, such as the enclosed photo being a copy of a print sent to the observer, and details about the camera and the location where the photo was taken. The document is concluded with the observer's analysis and conclusions about the potential significance of the reported UFO sighting.

CONCLUSION:
This report is submitted to supply information to those who are investigating unidentified flying objects. By itself it helps demonstrate that objects exist. When added to the ever-growing body of UFO information it may help in some way to discover the more important questions such as: What are UFO's? How are they propelled? What effect will they have upon mankind if they are inter-planetary in origin? It is to this end that this report is written. To the best of my knowledge the information contained within it is factual.

The Flying Saucers Are Reported
(MANCHESTER, N.H. CAP)
"Some students have reported to the police seeing unusual objects in the sky. They are telling the authorities that the objects were not airplanes or helicopters."

MANCHESTER, Mass. (AP) - Police received several calls from concerned citizens saying they had seen unusual objects in the sky over the past two nights. The officials said the objects were not identified as any known aerial vehicle.

Text Extracted from the Image:
Flying saucers are reported MANCHESTER, N.H., FEB. 8 (AP) - Two bright unidentified flying objects, described as similar to "flying saucers," were reported seen over this area late Saturday night. They were reportedly observed by several persons, including at least one member of the New Hampshire State Police.

Attention: Major Maston M. Jacks

Dear Major Jacks:

Enclosed please find detailed UFO Report and Photograph. 
I have enclosed a copy of my personal resume to provide background on myself as investigator. I have corresponded with ATIC in the past, vis: a report concerning a low-hovering UFO sighting by my wife in June 1961; a report on a sighting in South Weymouth, Mass. in June 1963; and, I've sent various newspaper clippings on UFOs to ATIC.

I have followed UFO Reports seriously since 1947 and hold membership in NICAP, APRO, and a local UFO Study Group etc. to provide myself with up-to-date information - hence my interest in making personal investigations whenever possible. I trust that this report will be of some value to you, if only a statistic. If I can be of any further help to you concerning any local UFO sighting in my area, I will be glad to cooperate.

Yours Sincerely,
[Redacted]

SIGHTING ACCOUNT

I was walking back to his dormitory from the cafeteria around 8:30 P.M. when I observed a peculiar flying object. It was flying slowly out of the West and moving toward the Northwest. It appeared that the was observing or examining something of an unusual nature, as it called the objects to Timothy's attention. They were slow moving objects that he observed from the fourth floor window which was on the fourth floor of the Administration Building; they were up a 16 diameter exposures capacity and attempted to obtain sequence-shots of the objects but the attempt was unsuccessful; they only succeeded in getting some shots when the objects passed directly overhead on a tripod and began taking time exposures of the objects. 

The objects came into their sight for a total of two hours and forty-five minutes. They left the scene when Timothy and David left the droploppy via an adjoining dark room.

I questioned Timothy about the possibility of their having seen objects which were spectacular and exceptional close together on that particular evening. He said emphatically that they were seeing stars; and although there were stars in the sky, they were not the stars they had recorded. He added that he knew what stars and planets looked like.

Although others saw the objects, they did not show very much interest. The report on the "Unidentified Flying Objects" (see clipping) indicates this. Timothy phoned the newspaper, (see clipping) No one except myself showed any interest in investigating, although they received an anonymous crank letter concerning it.

I feel genuinely sincere and objective observer. The photograph (attached) was taken by an excellent camera (a Pentox analyst) and both are competent photographers. Although there are minor inconsistencies (see report analyses) I am convinced it's overall contents are factual.
