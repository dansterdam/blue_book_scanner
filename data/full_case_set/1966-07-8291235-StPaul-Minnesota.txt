Dear Dr. Hynek,

I received the attached letter from a couple of days ago. I wish that you could have a look at this case. I don't know if you are checking on the Air Force concerning a recent sighting. You might tell them that we can't analyze because of publicity which would make the investigation and analysis more difficult.

Again, there is no hurry on this, however, give the man a call as soon as you have time.

Sincerely,

(SIGNATURE)

Dear Sirs:

At the request of the Office of Special Investigation of the United States Air Force stationed at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.

On Saturday night, July 16, 1966 between 10:30 and 11:00 PM, Central Day- light Saving Time, (as observed by myself, a businessman) sitting in our backyard when we observed in the southern portion of the sky, a light appearing to be traveling at a tremendous speed.

This light appeared to be at an extremely high altitude, but, of course, it could be impossible to judge any altitude. This light appeared to be a green light in front and a reddish light appeared behind the green light. As the object approached, it seemed to swerve slightly, as though it was about to turn. However, it seemed to continue its course. The light suddenly disappeared, as though it had been snapped off by a switch.

This event in itself, I would have passed off, but the next night at approximately the same time, it again occurred. We again observed the object in the same area of the sky, but this time, the object appeared to be traveling at a much slower rate of speed than the previous night. As in the previous night, the object disappeared behind the treetops and again it suddenly reappeared traveling in a northeasterly direction. The light then seemed to go into a cloud flurry. The second night this sighting was seen by the original four people plus another four or five neighbors and observers. When observed, it appeared to be traveling at a 30-45 degree segment of the sky in less than a minute.

The speed of this object, if it would compare to that of a falling meteorite.

We hope that this information may have some interest to you.

Sincerely yours,
