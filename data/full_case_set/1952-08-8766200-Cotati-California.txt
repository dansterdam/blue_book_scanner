When objects were first sighted I removed my glasses, to see if it could be reflection, but could see the same. They appeared one at a time and just as one was disappearing over hills on horizon another would appear. All appeared at the same spot to the southwest of Post. All traveled same speed until the last one. That one went to a point slightly northeast of Post and sat still for some 5 minutes, then made a quick dash to the north and returned to same still position. After a few seconds then it took off to the southwest and disappeared out over the hills, toward our coast line. At their great height they appeared like a white pingpong balls and yet were very definitely solid. Several persons, I am told, saw the same thing from the streets in various parts of Santa Rosa.

                     Possibly "Skyhook" from Tillamook Ore.,
                     at extremely high altitude, which could
                     seem to be flying slowly if they were large
                     & viewed high against the wind. Also, if they
                     moved with the wind, they would only be
                     viewed for thirty minutes.
