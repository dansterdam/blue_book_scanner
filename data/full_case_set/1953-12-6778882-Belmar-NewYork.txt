3. Subject: (Unclassified)
Reported sighting of unidentified flying objects.
SUBJECT: AIRTNER
 Subject reported sighting of 3 unidentified flying objects on 3 December 1953.
1. Was in the town of Belmar in the state of New Jersey on a drive when I happened to look up and saw 3 bright objects moving in the sky. They appeared to be either silver or white in color, round, and moved very rapidly in a southeasterly direction. At first I thought they might be jet aircraft, but they were moving much faster than any jet I have ever seen. The objects appeared to be at a very high altitude.
2. The duration of the observations was from 30 seconds to 1 minute.
The sighting was reported to the nearest Air Force office.

I believe the above information may be of interest to you concerning the sightings of unidentified flying objects. Please let me know if you desire any further information.

"UNCLASSIFIED

"Objects were sighted in the form of a round object. It was a cold and clear night with good visibility. The object made no sound and was observed for 3-5 minutes. The object started as a single point of light and increased in size to a large round object and then decreased in size, disappearing from sight.

2. Three observers confirmed the sighting of the object. The witnesses were Sergeant James F. Molnar of the 5th Air Force, Colonel Charles F. Stuart, Director of Intelligence of the 55th Air Force, Base and Major Thomas P. Allen, our Counterintelligence Corps officer of the 55th Air Force Base.

3. Photographic coverage was considered, but no satisfactory photographs were taken. This report contains all the information available and no further investigation is considered necessary."
