After finding out that Source lived at _____, the sheriff said that this place was owned by a woman who had been involved in a murder not long ago. He said that this woman was not very reliable and was believed to be operating a house of ill repute. The sheriff said that no information should be given to this woman about the Source.

INFORMATION FROM MRS. _____:
A check was made at the house of Mrs. _____ to see if the Source was there. She said that she made the Source leave her house about two months ago because he seemed to be a very odd person and she didn't like him around the house. She said that he would stay in the house all day and then go out at night with a telescope and stay until 11:00 or 2:00 in the morning. She gave the new address at where he was staying as _____.

INFORMATION FROM MR. _____, OWNER OF SOURCE'S RESIDENCE AT _____:
Mr. _____ stated that the Source was presently living at his house.

INFORMATION FROM MR DENNIS HURST, POSTMASTER OF MARIETTA, OHIO

During a telephone call from M/Sgt Bluemel to the Postmaster the following information was given:

Mr Hurst stated that approximately one year ago an official telegram came from Denver Colorado, to the post office of Marietta, Ohio. The Postmaster knowing that the Source had no telephone number took it to his house and tried to deliver the message. Upon his arriving the Postmaster heard the radio playing and knocked on the door. The radio was shut off but no-one came to the door. The Postmaster knowing that some-one was home knocked at the door again. Eventually Source came to the door and inquired who was there. The Postmaster identified himself and stated that he had an official telegram from Denver Colorado addressed to the Source and asked Source to open the door. Source refused to open the door so the Postmaster departed without delivering the message. The Postmaster then went to the neighbors' and asked what type of man lived there and why he wouldn't open the door. He was told by the neighbors that the person living there was a "Queer Character" who kept the blinds closed all day and never left the house. The Postmaster then reported this incident to the Marietta City Police.

After receiving this information the sheriff was asked to contact the City Police Dept. to see if this incident had been recorded. No entry of this incident was found the officer on duty at that time.

I. SOURCE:
Address: Marietta, Ohio 
Age: 40
Occupation: Unemployed
Education: High School Graduate, 2 years of College: LACC, UCLA and USC.
Qualifications: None

II. RELIABILITY: During the interview, the source was very inconsistent in his story. He could never stay within the general line of questioning but varied from subject to subject. He was somewhat familiar with when questions on UFO's and civilian aircraft but when he would switch to the bizarre and would refer to the type of flying vehicles illustrated in Science Fiction literature.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At 00:05 EST, 9 May 1958, the source was atop a hill just south of Marietta, Ohio, when he sighted the object just north of Parkersburg, W.Va. traveling from east to west. He described the object as having four (4) lights in color, in front and one (1) bright white-light, not flashing, in the rear. Source said that the object appeared to be traveling at a speed of approximately three miles away, and the size of a small type airborne, traveling at a speed of 50 miles per hour. Source also stated that the object did not make any sound and that the weather was clear with no wind. He said that he had observed this object twice before, once on 24 April 1958 and again on 9 April 1958. The sightings were for approximately five (5) minutes. All sightings were done with the aid of binoculars and telescope. Source said that the only difference between the three sightings was the rear light from white to a reddish-white. In Source's opinion this object was an occupied or unoccupied vehicle from outer space and from a planet other than earth.

1. After making a local routine investigation it was decided by the investigators that there was not enough information available to determine what the object was that was sighted. Therefore the investigators proceeded to the area of sighting and the following information was recorded:
2. At 0800, 13 May 1958, Capt Hoffman was contacted at the Filter Center in Charleston W.Va., and stated that after checking all observation posts, in the area of sighting, no unusual sightings were called in during 8 and 9 May 1958, also that he had not received a UFOB report in over two months.
3. At 1645, 13 May 1958, the investigators reported to 1st Lt Miller, adjutant of the 783rd ACWI Squadron, Guthrie AFS, W.Va. They were then taken to Capt Schwarz, Chief Controller, and a complete check of all traces and radar scope readings were made for a period of four hours before and after the time given for the UFOB sighting. All traces were identified by the Chief Controller and there were no indications of a UFOB in the reported area during 8 and 9 May 1958.
4. At 1345, 13 May 1958, the investigators departed Guthrie AFS and proceeded to Marietta, Ohio. They arrived at Marietta, Ohio, at 1510, 13 May 1958, and reported to Sheriff Dean Ellis, Sheriff of Washington County, Ohio. A check was made and it was found out that the source had given an erroneous address on the report. A further check was made with the post office and it was found out that the last address given by Source was at 11111 Marietta, Ohio. After checking the above address it was found out that Source had moved to 22222 Marietta, Ohio. A check was made at the new address and no one was at home. After checking with neighbors it was found that the owner of the home was at work. The owner was contacted at his place of employment and confirmed the fact that the Source was living at his home as a roomer. The Source was then contacted at approximately 1645, 13 May 1958, and taken to the Town Motel for an interview regarding the UFOB he reported.
5. The Source was quite cooperative; however, immediately before the interview began, Source informed the investigators that he had given "false" rights as an "eyewitness."

as after having talked to the Sheriff, the Postmaster and the last two Land lords where Source had lived, and also after a complete interview with the Source, it was then determined that the report Source had made was a complete fabrication or a figment of his imagination. He had no visible means of support, stating that he received money from unknown persons property from un-able just had died. It was also impossible to find out where this property was because every time Source was asked this question he would give a different answer.

7. Source also stated that he had been a member of AFSCO from 1935-1937 and a member of NICAP from January 1957 until the present time. The following is a probable definition of APRO and NICAP as given by Source: APRO: Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, located in California. NICAP: A UFO Club established by Donald E. Keyhoe. Source stated that he had paid $10.00 to NICAP and all he ever received were booklets. He also thought it was the United States Air Force that had restrained NICAP from doing the job it was supposed to do, mainly located and investigating the real flying saucers and where they come from.

8. Source also stated that he was a high school graduate and had 2+ years of college at LACC, UCLA, AND USC; however, after having talked to the Source it was the opinion of the investigators that the educational level of Source was not as he stated.

9. Information from Sheriff Dean Ellis: The sheriff stated that Mr. Source was not known to him personally and that there were no records of him on file in the sheriff's office or city police station. After finding out that Source lived at an address, the sheriff said that this place was owned by a Mrs. who was a woman who had been involved in a murder not long ago. He said that this woman was not very reliable and was believed to be operating a house of ill repute.

She said that he would stay in the house all day and then go out at night with a telescope and stay until 01:00 or 02:00 in the morning. She gave the new address at where he was staying as 705 2nd St. Source was eventually located at this address.

11. Information from Mr. B, owner of Source's residence at C:
Mr. B stated that the Source was presently staying at his house. He said that the Source had no visible means of support; however, the Source had told him that he had been left some property in W. Va. and SE Ohio, by an uncle who died and that this is his only means of support. He also stated that the Source goes out during the day but comes out every night and returns about 01:00 - 02:00 in the morning. Source told Mr. B that there may be someone calling by telephone or in person to see him and to take their address or phone and he would call. Mr. B also stated that he thought the Source acted rather odd at times and was not too happy about his residing at his home.

12. Information from Mr. D, Postmaster of Marietta, Ohio: During a telephone call to the Postmaster the following information was given: Mr. D stated that approximately one year ago an official telegram came from Denver, Colorado, to the post office at Marietta, Ohio.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Det #3, 1006th AISS
1. DESCRIPTION OF SOURCE: Mr. JAMES X. SOUCEK, United States citizen, 19, resident of MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., and student at LOS ANGELES CITY COLLEGE, University of CALIFORNIA, at LOS ANGELES. SOUCEK stated that he had been interested in theories of flying saucers (or "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS") for some time and had been an active member of a flying saucer club UFON CLUB) located in CALIFORNIA and "NICAP" (a UFON CLUB).
II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: The interviewer attempted to judge SOUCEK's reliability and believability. SOUCEK described himself as familiar with "flying saucer" theories and stated that he had worked at the airport and studied some engineering. However, the interviewer began the interview by stating that SOUCEK's claims were initially difficult to evaluate and must be subjected to verification.
The interviewers felt that SOUCEK was telling the truth as he knew it, but they added that in their opinion the object he claimed to have seen was more likely an aircraft than a "flying saucer" or UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. Soucek's opinion differed from the interviewers' opinion. Soucek's description of the object was vague and general, and the interviewers could find no other witnesses to corroborate his statements. The interviewers concluded that SOUCEK's reliability was open to question.
III. REPORTED SIGHTING: SOUCEK stated that on 9 May 1958, at about 2145 hours, while driving north on HIGHWAY 101, five lights were observed approximately 3 miles west. He described the lights as four amber-white, followed by one blue-green light. The lights were in a close formation and appeared to him to be aircraft (PIPER type) flying in the same direction as the highway. SOUCEK said he could hear no sound. He said the weather was clear. He stated that the lights were at about 2000 feet altitude and made no abrupt maneuvers. SOUCEK observed the lights for approximately 10 minutes, using field glasses and a telescope. He believed the lights were vehicles moving through the air and not any unusual air or space phenomena.

V. COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICER. The information presented by S UNCK originated properly from a sighting of an unknown object observed by several persons. The details of their descriptions are in keeping with the usual pattern of eye-witness accounts. There is no information to indicate that the reported UFOS are probably not a normal phenomena, and the description bears little if any credibility.

Investigators comment's: 
"Sighter confirms - Shape as described was thought to have been a larger than average aircraft. However, thinking it over, it did to appear to move differently and faster than any sighted aircraft in this area at this time. Sighter is definite on large size and 'strange' movement. Could not identify definitely."

There is no photograph present in the image provided. The image appears to be a scanned document titled "UFO OBSERVERS INSTRUCTION SHEET (Sky Diagram)". The document provides instructions and guidance for observers to plot the course of UFO objects on a sky diagram, including details on how to measure elevation, bearing, and other characteristics of observed objects.

UFO OBSERVERS INSTRUCTION SHEET 
(Sky Diagram)

1. GENERAL:
a. The diagram represents all of the sky normally visible to the observer, 
who is pictured standing under the center of the "dome" of the sky.  It is designed 
to show a three-dimensional view of the area around the observer at the 
time of the UFO sighting.

b. The position of any object in the sky can be described by giving its 
elevation, or angle upward from the horizon, and its bearing or angle along the 
horizon, eastward from north.

(1) Illustrations:
(a) Elevation is 0 degrees for an object on the horizon, and 90 
degrees for the point directly over the observer (zenith). Thus, 
an object half-way up from the horizon to the zenith has an 
elevation of 45 degrees.
(b) Bearing (or "azimuth") is the angle along the horizon, starting 
from north and working clockwise eastward. Thus an object 
directly toward the east, no matter what its elevation is above 
the horizon, has a bearing of 90 degrees; an object in the south 
has a bearing of 180 degrees toward the west, 270 degrees and 
so on. (North is 0 degrees)

EXAMPLE: An object is seen in the northeast and one-third way 
up from horizon to overhead. Thus, the object has a bearing of
45 degrees, and elevation of 30 degrees. Similarly, an object 
halfway a bearing of 180 degrees and an elevation of 60 degrees 
would be seen directly south and two-thirds of the way up from 
the horizon.

2. PLOTTING THE COURSE OF AN OBJECT ON THE SKY DIAGRAM:
a. The path of an object across the sky can be shown completely on this 
diagram simply by connecting which its course or track line the visualizations 
the object makes at various intervals. Thus it gives continuity to the 
path on the western side of the sky is represented by broken lines, the eastern side
in solid lines. Direction of the object is indicated by arrows. The duration of
the sighting can be shown by indicating the time at the position where the object 
was first and last observed. Where possible, the time at various intermediate  
positions occupied by the object should also be shown.

b. The diagrams can be made more effective and analytical tool
by making the lines (showing the path of the object) thicker or thinner to indicate  
any varying brightnesses of the object observed. This is especially valuable when 
the object appeared only as a moving light at first. Thus, if a light becomes 
brighter and then gradually fades, it can be represented by a line becoming increasingly
thinner.

6. Use of colored pencils is especially recommended if the object changes color 
or hue during the sighting.

Text extracted from the document:

3. EXAMPLE OF DIAGRAM USE:
Southeasterly, about half-way up from the horizon to overhead, at 10:45 hi local time. The object appeared to be circular with a dark rounded center and a brighter outer rim about the size of a pen (at arm's length) from where observed. It was dim at first but brightened considerably as it got higher in the sky. Its color at this point was bluish white. After about two minutes it crossed to the western part of the sky a little to the north and it got brighter and stood out clearly against the dark sky. The object appeared to have a two-thirds of the way to the horizon. It then stopped and hovered for about one minute and then climbed rapidly, going toward the southeast and getting brighter. In less than thirty seconds it had climbed to an elevation of approximately 60 degrees, and then the light went out abruptly.

4. FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS AND INFORMATION:
a. Relatively complex trajectories can easily be shown on a diagram of this type. A number of objects sighted can also be indicated, as can any changing formations. The apparent size and shape of the object should be drawn in, preferably by the observer in the case as he or she Judged them to be.
b. The use of colored pencils is very desirable to indicate change of color, as color change may be a significant factor.
c. The landscaping in the sky diagram is placed there to help visualization. If by your description landmarks are mentioned, these should be incorporated into the drawing. These landmarks may later prove to be invaluable for location, plotting or reference points.
c. If you are familiar with the constellations or other heavenly bodies, indicate if possible, the relationship (and movements) of the object with respect to those bodies. This can sometimes be sketched on either page 6 or piece 9-10. The description illustrated: "...The object seemed to pass very slowly between the two bottom stars on the handle of the Big Dipper..."

The image appears to be a diagram or illustration showing a spherical projection of the horizon, with azimuth and elevation lines marked. There are also some text labels indicating cardinal directions (N, E, S, W) and numeric values for elevation angles (30, 45, 60, 90 degrees). The diagram appears to be part of a technical document or report.

MARIETTA, OHIO
7 MAY 1958
REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

On 7 May 1958, at approximately 2130 hours, the writer received a telephone call from Mr XXXXX, who reported that he had observed an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of Marietta, Ohio.

Mr XXXXX stated that at approximately 2115 hours he was outside his residence when he observed a bright light in the sky to the northwest. The light was stationary for a short time, then it moved in a northerly direction and then changed direction to the northeast. The object was visible for approximately 1 minute. Mr XXXXX stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape and was very bright. He described the color of the object as white.

Upon receiving this report, the writer immediately contacted the Marietta Police Department and the Marietta Air Force Base. The Marietta Police Department stated that they had received no other reports of unidentified flying objects in the area. The Marietta Air Force Base was contacted but they had no information regarding the sighting.

No further information is available.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed report or document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text of the document is as follows:

Upon receiving a request to investigate a UFOB, in the area of Marietta, Ohio, from Capt Uvenger at ATIC, M/Sgt Blumel and M/Sgt Nickerson made a preliminary check with 4717 GCC, Base Weather, and 58th Air Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio.

A check made at Base Weather established that the weather at Marietta, Ohio, during the period of sighting indicated clear skies with a 5 mile visibility. A check made with 4717GCC at WPAFB indicated that the Filter Center at Charleston W.Va. had not reported any unidentified sighting during the period of sighting. A call was made by Capt Hendrick from the GCC at WPAFB to Capt Hoffman at the Filter Center in Charleston W. Va., to ask him to make a complete check of all observation posts in the area of sighting.

Sgt Blumel and Sgt Nickerson then talked to Lt Col Bennett, the D/I for the 58th Air Division at WPAFB. He said that the maneuver ACH&W Sq located at Guthrie AFS, Guthrie W.Va.. Lt Col Bennett also stated that the report was phoned direct to WPAFB from Marietta, Ohio, and received by Lt Col Delmar I. Me Cracken at AMC Command Post. Lt Col Mc Cracken then forwarded the information to Sgt Farr at the 58th Air Division Control Room, at which time a routine report was made and reported by TWX to all organizations concerned.

After collecting all information available at WPAFB Sgt Bluemerl and Sgt Nickerson proceeded to Charleston W.Va., and stated that after checking all observation posts, the Marietta, Ohio, area no unusual sightings were called in during 8 and 9 May 1958, also that he had not received a UFOB report in over two months.

At 1045, 13 May 1958, Sgt Blumel and Sgt Nickerson reported to 1st Lt Miller, Adjutant of the 783rd AC&W Sq, Guthrie AFS, W.Va. They were then taken to Capt Schwarz, Chief Controller, and complete check of all tracks and radar scope readings were made for a period to four hours before and after the time given for the UFOB sighting. All sightings were identified by the Capt, Controller and there were no indications of a UFOB in the reported area during 8 and 9 May 1958.

At 1245, 13 May 1958, Sgt Bluemel and Sgt Nickerson departed Guthrie AFB and proceeded to Marietta, Ohio. They arrived at Marietta, Ohio, at 1510, 13 May 1958, and proceeded to Sheriff John Ellis, Sheriff of Washington County, Ohio. A check was made and it was found out that the source had given an erroneous address on the report. A further check was made with the Post Office and it was found out that the last address given by the source was at 602 7th St., Marietta, Ohio. After checking the above address, it was found out that the source had moved to 705 2nd St. A check was made at the new address and no one was at home. After checking with neighbors, it was found that the owner of the home was at work. The owner was contacted at his place of employment and confirmed the fact that the source was living at his home as a roomer. The source was then contacted at approximately 1845, 13 May 1958, and taken to the Ivon Motel for an interview regarding UFOB he reported.

The source was quite cooperative; however, immediately before the interview began, source informed Sgt Bluemel and Sgt Nickerson that he knew his rights as an American Citizen and was not now or had ever been a Communist or a Communist Party member. After having talked to the sheriff, the investigators and the last two landlords where the source had lived, and also after a complete interview with the source, it was then determined that the report source had made was a complete fabrication or a figment of his imagination. He had no visible means of support, stating that he had received money from income property from an uncle that had died. It was also impossible to find out where this property was because every time source was asked this question he would give a different answer.

Source also stated that he had been a member of APRO from 1935-57 and a member of NICAP from January 1957 until the present time.

The following is a probable definition of APRO and NICAP as given by Source:

APRO: Aerial Phenomena Research Organization
NICAP: A UFOB Club established by Donald E. Keyhoe.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, containing only text.

OCR output:

Source stated that he had paid $10.00 to NICAP and all he ever got were a few booklets. 

Source also stated that he was a high school graduate and had 2½ years of college at LACC, UCLA and USC; however, after having talked to the Source it was the opinion of the interviewers that the educational level of Source was not as he stated.
