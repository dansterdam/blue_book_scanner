These young ladies have apparently sighted a flying object of some kind for the first time. Estimated of their report follow:

TIME: 0230 o'clock. Bright, clear night. They were facing east and saw the object going from N.W. to S.E.

Object much brighter than star. Did appear to be small in size and to be traveling quite slowly.

Object appeared to move around and reverse direction. Seemed very intentional in its movements.

NOTES: These are standard witness statements in a complete report of their sighting. No further details or documentation available.
