The Arvida Algoma Branch has recently received reports of unidentified flying objects over the northern United States. Mr. Carl Gustafson of the Canadian Branch Range has investigated and has issued a statement on chemical cloud releases from Fort Churchill during the last few weeks. Specifically, one of the instances involved an increased in launching on 27 July 1967. CPT - - Port Churchill was engaged in any type of upper atmospheric probing operation the above two days, the information would be helpful in evaluating UFO cases.

Dear Col. Manatt:

I refer to your letter, TDBT/UFO, of the 14 August, 1967. 

Two Black Brant VB rockets carried a barium payload for release of ion clouds. The times at which these rockets were released are given below:

(1) 0236 hours 01.08 seconds GMT on 9 August, 1967.
(2) 2303 hours 33.662 seconds GMT on 6 August, 1967.

We however, did not launch any chemical releases above information which I hope is useful in touch with a as you require further information.

Yours truly,

R. Husmann
Acting Officer of Operations,
HQ Churchill Research Range.
