OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

May 24, 1968

Dear Mr. _________,

This replies to your recent letter concerning the observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO).

Without essential information, such as detailed flight characteristics, angular velocities, or weather information, we are unable to undertake a scientific investigation. Had you contacted the UFO investigator at your nearest Air Force base immediately, an on-the-spot investigation would have been possible.

We hope the enclosed Project Blue Book report may be of help to you in identifying your observation.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

Chief, Civil Branch
Community Relations Division
Office of Information

Transcribing the text in the document:

To whom it may concern,
My name is [REDACTED] and I am in 10th grade. What I'm about to write and ask you must be confidential, but hear me out.

On the night of Sept. 16, 1967, I had sited a satellite pass over head. Some-else had sighted it also. A very bright light was seen in the distance.(In the direction)
It was the brightest light in the sky that night. While we (my cousin and I) watched the satellite following its normal course, this bright light seemed to lock on to the satellite. It had risen (rising) rapidly in the sky and seemed to follow the satellite. At about the mid-point where I had first sighted it, and where the satellite was, the light dimmed to the brightness of any other star in the sky. (Dimmed on other aspect of the object or person?)

(For diagram) Point A is the place where first sighted. Point B is the second sighting. Point C is the place where the bright light dimmed itself to the light of any other star in the sky. Point D is near the area of the satellite. The unidenti-fied object seemed to ascend and caught up to the satellite. The rate of change of the object's light, well, snap your fingers. That was the rate of change. If it is possible what I saw isn't confidential, answer these questions:

1) On the night of Sept. 16, 1967, did a satellite see to disappear?
2) How about the unidentified objects if possible, tell me: what was in the sky that night?

Sincerely yours, 
[REDACTED]
Johnstown, Penna. 15906

P.S.: I also had a pair of binoculars on hand. (Not some cheap binoculars)
