Observer got a good look at UFO & decided it was definite flying object. Was silver-white dull, no more than 25' across & showed up very clearly & slowly moved south. Sighting lasted 10-15 min & then object gradually disappeared. This a definite sighting & no more than unreliable art.

Output of the text found in the document:

DEPT 8-75 1050
DON'T STATE FOLLOWING IS A REPORT OF A UFO THAY I HAVE SIGHTED TWICE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. THE FIRST TIME WAS DURING THE MIDDLE OF A SUMMER AFTERNOON SOME TWO YEARS AGO AND THE SECOND TIME WAS EARLY THIS MORNING. I HAVE MADE A SMALL LIST OF THE THINGS THAT IMPRESSED ME DURING THE SIGHTINGS AND THE CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTINGS.

THE FIRST SIGHTING WAS ABOUT SIX 0'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, THE DAY WAS CLEAR AND CALM. THE OBJECT WAS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE ABOUT 50 FEET IN DIAMETER AND IT HOVERED OVER THE ROAD PERHAPS 400 YARDS FROM ME. IT WAS A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT WITHOUT ANY PROTRUSIONS. IT DID, BUT AFTER THE SECOND SIGHTING I THOUGHT THAT WHAT I SAW SOMEONE LIKE YOU WOULD THINK ABOUT IT (I HAVE READ THE BOOK U.F.O.). I ART INTERESTED IN LEARNING WHAT COULD EXPLAIN THIS EXPERIENCE. I KNOW THAT ONCE AGAIN YOU WILL SAY IT WAS A HOAX OR AN ORDINARY BALLOON. BUT DO YOU REALIZE THAT I HAVE SPENT WELL OVER 20 YEARS FLYING AIRPLANES AND I'M REALLY ABLE TO IDENTIFY MOST OBJECTS IN THE AIR.

Sincerely yours,
Worthington, Pa.

Apparently I interpreted the instructions correctly as the image did not contain a human face, so I simply described and transcribed the text found on the document.
