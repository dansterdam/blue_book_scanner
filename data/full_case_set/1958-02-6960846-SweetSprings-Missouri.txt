AF FORM 112—PART II

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. 1V—L_58
PAGE 2 or 3 PAGES
10. None
11. Comments - GIG, Mission Support Section. Operational Intelligence, 2/14 Part H.

In lieu of Mr. [REDACTED] credibility as a witness, his account appears to be reasonable and logical. However, should additional corroborating data be available which indicates that the details he gave cannot be accurate, the case that if Mr. [REDACTED] account is valid the object will be disproven as the usual fallacy who have been mistaken when they thought they saw whatever. 

EARL H. McCAULEY
2/Lt. USAF
GIG, Mission Support Section

Investigation of the above mentioned sighting was as follows:
While driving a civilian automobile at approximately 10:45 PM, January 2, 1958, near a light (unknown) caused him to observe an object for about two (2) minutes. He stated that the object appeared to be metallic and elongated, moving North at a light to moderate speed and seemed to be a light in color. The object disappeared to the North West heading and fell rapidly at an angle of about fifty (50) degrees. It did not appear to oscillate or tumble.
The intensity of the light was like that of a magnesium flare and emitted a great deal of white smoke and sparks at the time of the object falling or descent to the ground. It did not appear to oscilla te or tumble.
The duration of the sighting, Mr. [REDACTED] estimated, was only about two (2) minutes at the most.
To the best of his knowledge, no other persons in the area saw the sighting but a Negro boy, age 12 or 13, was a witness who did see the object. However, the investigating officer was unable to develop any information from him to corroborate the account.
Mr. [REDACTED] and trooper Roberts were both contacted by investigators. Their interviews disclosed that Mr. [REDACTED] sighting was given in good faith, and in a logical and reasonable manner, however, no physical evidence or witnesses other than Mr. [REDACTED] and the Negro boy were developed to support the report.
Individual interviews with Trooper Roberts and Mr. [REDACTED] disclosed that there were no other unusual circumstances or activities in the area at the time of the sighting.

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a detailed written description of a UFO sighting.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

At 6:00 P.M. on 19 February 1958, Mr. ___ was clearing brush on his father's farm which is located 18 miles southwest of Marshall, Missouri. At this time, he noticed a moving light in the sky to the southeast of his location, travelling at an angle of about 30 degrees and was visible for about two seconds.

The object was silver in color, bullet shaped and estimated to be 20 feet long, 4 to 5 feet in diameter, trailing red flame and grey smoke. 

The smoke dissipated rapidly, leaving no contrail. Mr. ___ at first sighting, thought it was a meteor but as it came closer it resembled an airplane without wings. Suddenly there was a puff of white smoke and a piece of the object became detached. After the puff of smoke, the object fell straight down and did not appear to oscillate or tumble.

Mr. ___ immediately ran to his car, which was parked 1/2 mile away, and drove to the area in which he believed it to land, but was unable to locate anything. He contacted the neighbors in the area but none of them saw anything.  

At 7:30 P.M. the same day, he contacted State Trooper Roberts and Mr. ___, who came to the area and reported what he had seen. The three of them immediately toured the area in question in the police car until darkness prevented further search.

Trooper Roberts and Mr. ___ contacted several persons who knew Mr. ___ and inquired as to his character. They all considered him to be reliable and of good character.
