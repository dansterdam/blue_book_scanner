UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #138 -- Columbus, Ohio -- 8 July 1948

There is clearly nothing of astronomical character in this incident.

It is the present investigator's opinion that the objects were aircraft. The "bobbing up and down" can be explained as a "seeing" effect -- that is, distortion of the image by air currents.
