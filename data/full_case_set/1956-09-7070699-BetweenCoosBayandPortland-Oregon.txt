Mrs. ____. _________ _____ _______ ______ ______ ____ ______. 

_________________ _____ , ___          ___ __________

Jan.29,1957 Mr. Wallace W. Elwood Air Technical Intelligence Center Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Ohio 

Dear Mr. Elwood: 
  
Thank you so very much for your painstaking letter of the 17th with its most welcome enlargements of the tiny little “Space ship” print which I sent to you. Unfortunately the film has not yet come to light but those who saw the film were convinced that it was no water mark nor imperfection on the airplane window.

I wish I could give you the information you seem to need. I could not fill out the questionnaire you sent me as I had none of that required information. As my film was not developed until the middle of September, and as I did not see the ship, I have no idea of the exact moment of its being taken or caught by my camera. As for the flight number and such details, all I know is that I was in a commercial plane flying between Coos Bay and Portland,Oregon on September 6th, 1956, leaving Coos Bay at 2:30 P.M. and arriving at Portland at 3:30 P.M. As I took the pictures from the plane soon after taking off, I estimated the time to be around three o'clock.

I thought you might know whether we had anything in the air in that location about that time that might resemble this, but I didn't realize that you needed so much detail regarding the sighting.

In any case I am grateful to you for your detailed answer to me and the time you took to make it all clear to me.

I assume that I may keep the prints (since you did not mention their return) which you sent on and in that case thank you very much.

                                                                                          Very truly yours,

On October 6th while flying 
29,000 feet in the air between

Before determining that it
is an alien space craft, I wonder
whether from your records -

you could tell me whether you had
any type American machines
in the air at that time,
I took the picture at about
three o'clock in the afternoon.

I was trying to get some of
the ground features but we
were too high up with the

features, judging from the
small size of the ship it must
have been several miles away.

If you will look at the ship thro’ a magnifying glass I believ you will see several windows on the side that is visible.

                    BROOKLYN, N.Y.  

Mr. Wallace W. Elwood
Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio.

                                        Dec. 27, 1955

Dear Mr. Elwood:

    Thank you for your letter of December 4th. In answer to mine of November 20th, stating that on September 6th, around three o'clock in the afternoon while flying high between Coos Bay and Portland, Oregon, I caught a Brownie snapshot of what I believed to be an outer space ship since it perfectly answers the description of the cigar or submarine shaped ship known to have been seen by others in that general location from time to time. I sent you a print of it at the time.
    
    You did not answer my question as to whether our government had any of its ships in the air on that date and about that hour.

    As for filling out all the data you sent me or answering your questions about the air craft speed, direction of heading, bearing, weather conditions aloft, flight or aircraft number, pilot's name etc. etc. or whether any other passengers observed the object, that is quite impossible as I was unaware of having caught it on my film at the time (I did not see the craft itself) and only found it only when the film was developed. Those who developed it for me were convinced that it was in the film and not an imperfection of either the film or something on the window of the plane. You see I took several other exposures at the time within minutes of each other, in an effort to catch some of the ground patterns but this one only was the ship apparent. So I figure that it must have been passing rapidly at the moment I snapped the shutter. With a magnifying glass you can see the tiny white windows.
    
    Unfortunately I cannot send you the film as it has been temporarily misplaced. Did you ever put something special away in such a good place that even you could not find it? I'm sure it will eventually turn up.
    
    I would still like an answer to my question of whether our government had anything of this description in the air at that time and location.
    
    The holidays interfered with a more prompt reply on my part for which I ask your indulgence.
    
                                        Very truly yours,

submit a photograph of an unidentified aerial object with a request
for our comments.

A proper study, and analysis under scientific conditions to arrive
at a firm conclusion or identification of the photograph requires somo
supporting information.  The fact that it was taken at a high altitude,
presumably from a airliner with other limited data surrounding your 
submission, is insufficient.  We are certain that since you have pro-

Additional information that is required to obtain done very im-
portant items (such as aircraft speed, direction of heading, bearings,
weather conditions aleloft) is the flight of aircraft number, exact time
and location over which the object was observed, pilot’s name, how close to 
a window was the camera when the exposure made, and whether any
other passengers observed the object. it would also be appreciated if 
you would lend us the negative from which this print was made. The
print will be retained, pending receipt of additional information re-
quired to study the photograph submitted.

1. In accordance with AFR 200-2 and established AITC policy for the review and analysis of UFO reports and photography, request your analysis and comments with regard to attached photograph.

2. Subject photograph was submitted by a Miss of Brooklyn, New York, and in her meager report states that it was taken at 27,000 feet, presumably from an airliner. She further states that a "Brownie" camera was used.

3. There are some unusual features surrounding the photo. A macroscopic examination shows a 'halo' or margin surrounding the object. The object is much darker than the background and from the over-all nature is very difficult to discern which is ground and which is sky, both blending in together. Assuming a distance of 300 yards (approximately 1000 feet) of the object, the "halo" would be approximately 50 feet wide. Consideration has been given to this being a negative or developing "flaw,” but the object appears rather symmetrical on both sides.

4. A letter to Miss with a standard UFO questionnaire requesting detailed information on the sighting is contemplated, pending your conclusions.

The object appears to be the result of damaged emulsion on the original negative. This probably was caused during the processing wherein the emulsion stuck together during part of the processing resulting in a partially developed "spot" that will print out darker than the background, more comprehensive analysis of the object can be made from the original film. In this, it can be determined if the object has caused by a flaw in the negative emulsion, or whether it is worthy of further analysis

Some comments should be made regarding the results of our analysis
of your report. The original negative would have provided us
a more conclusive information:

a. Brownie cameras have a single-element meniscus lens.
They have a very slow shutter speed, between 1/25 to 1/30 seconds.
b. A query of your local photo experts, or an experiment on
your part in photographing some person will disclose that unless
the subject remains still a slight blur will result. A slow-moving
automobile photographed with a Brownie will produce a more blurred
effect
c. Anything passing rapidly, as you state, by the window,
such as an aircraft or rocket would be an almost indistinct blur.
The Brownie camera cannot stop an object moving at high speed. The
distinct outline of a road in the bottom of the print indicates that
"panning" was not used.
d. The object in your print is sharp and clear.
e. If this was an actual object, the use of simple optical
calculations (the known focal length of the camera and apparent dis
tance of the object), "several miles away," will show that the object
would be of such size that it certainly would have been seen by a
large number of people, numerous aircraft, and by the extensive radar
network that surveys the skies over America twenty-four hours a day.
f. Nothing of this nature was reported by any of the above
within that general area and time.
A review of current airway charts between Coos Bay and Portland
indicates that this area has one of the heaviest air traffics in the
Northwest. There are almost 30 airfields within the flight paths be
tween these two locations.

Our files contain many photographs (other than deliberate hoaxes)
which have been found to be spots or smears on airliner windows re
sembling various types of supposedly space craft. Emulsion flaws
are also accounted for a number of these objects appearing on photo
graphs. The latter results when prints under development, in a solu
tion or water bath, become stuck together in certain small areas,
tear drop, elliptical and other unusual shapes are formed when
