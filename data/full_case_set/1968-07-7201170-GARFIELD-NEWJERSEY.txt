On July 27, 1966 at 11:50 p.m. Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] observed an unusual object in the sky over Garfield, N.J. This object was described as being the size of a man's head, hovering in the air and wavering up and down. They thought at first it to be a plane or a helicopter, but this object was to high up to be either one of these. It would slow down to a crawl and then go so fast that you could not see it. It would appear to be a plane or a jet, but it could not be for the light was steady and would not blink up. Also this object had a hig-h-powered light which appeared to be white in color, but would dim down to a star-like appearance. It was higher than the planes that we observe in the sky. Their was no sounds in the sky.

Very sincerely
[redacted]
