Borger, Texas.  
A.16.27.1963.

Project Bluebook, Wright Air Force Base, Dayton Ohio. 

Dear Sir:

Yesterday I read with much interest, The article which appeared in our local newspaper, and said that your tracking down my report is concerning something reminded me about the time a dozen years ago when I saw a mysterious object low in the sky. You can be sure that this husband of mine is not one of the crackpots laughed at by those I told about my strange experience. However we would not read or hear something about this subject but It is vital that we should not make any article or anything about object which waved us calling card on the front lawn of the house where we lived a while ago.

After study on the contents of this month's air letter of 1963, that man 60 years old to come over and take a look at something which he did not came back a few minutes later very much amazed at what I had described on Ted's law. We both went back almost a perfect heart was there on the lawn. The color was about 5 feet across and the ground was three distinct brighter was those. The strange ground area was not mown down in the least. The color was down each blade of grass. With the sun shining on this what of a shape was around it could not be identified what of an object as those the ground. There were several big clumps of the same substance on the ground. A deputy sheriff came out took colored pictures and I have copies of those given to me. 

Sincerely yours,

I wish I could send you a sample of the substance but what was it? I wish I knew and I am quite sure had some one of us".

Dear Major Jones: 

I hate to bother you again, but this is another report of an unusual phenomenon which I feel should be brought to your attention. Last night at approximately 11:00 p.m. a bright object, larger than a star and brighter, was seen hovering in the sky for a few minutes and then suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view. The object was seen by several persons and was observed for a period of about 3 to 4 minutes. I would appreciate your investigation of this incident at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mrs. [name redacted],

Possibly by now you have been contacted by one or someone acting for the U.S. investigating the strange design or markings which you have been informed concerning the grass to be "used" as a species of grass fly.

It is rather unusual happening with an unusual answer and to our knowledge nothing such as this has been found or knowledge concerning things such as are frequently attributed to saucers.

Cordially,

C. R. HART
