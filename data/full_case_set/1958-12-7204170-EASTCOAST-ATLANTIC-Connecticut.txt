FLOWER AND COOK OBSERVATORIES

1959 July 30

Executive Officer,
Public Information Division
Office of Information Service
Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

Last year the Executive Officer very kindly, in reply to a request from me for information about certain fireballs which appeared in 1957, sent me a considerable amount of useful information, which can be used in the solution of the atmospheric paths and orbits of these bodies.

During the past year or so a large number of fireballs have appeared over the eastern or south eastern states, and in the cases of the five to be mentioned, I have been able to assemble a number of observations. But despite this I find it impossible to make good solutions. I am therefore writing to urgently request that you be good enough to send me copies of any or all reports in your hands, dealing with these bodies.

I may add the Hydrographic Office of the U. S. Navy has for over 30 years effectively cooperated in such work and as a consequence it has been possible to solve for many important fireballs. Such cooperation from your office, as a routine matter, would also be invaluable.

The specific bodies I now request information on are:

1958 April 28/29/S/Southeastern States 8:20 pm Ariz. 28
1958 July 4/5 North Carolina etc. 1 a and July 5
1958 Nov. 30 South Carolina etc. 6:10 pm Nov. 30
1958 Dec. 12/13 New York, New Jersey etc. 12:42 am Dec. 14
1959 Feb. 10/11 South Carolina etc. 4:15 am Feb. 11 

It would be a great favor to me and useful to science if you would be good enough to send me observations dealing with these fireballs.

Very sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
Narberth, Pa.

sparks were observed floating outward after explosion. This same object
was seen from a position of 31 degrees 30°'N, 71 degrees 30’ 30°W, and 32 degrees
30°N, 70 degrees 30’W by three other aircraft.

light, yellow, slightly larger than a quarter, with a dark red tail seven
times longer than object, was observed at a great height. It moved from
