Transcription of the text in the document:

There was only the one object?
The object was a luminous thing. It seemed to have little features such as you find on manmade objects. However, it saw only a slender object. I don't know what the shape called it 'negative.' There was no exhaust, no trail following it. It disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.  

Was there any sound?
Other than the noise of the aircraft, there was none that I heard or know. The aircraft, of course, was in the distance and the sound accompanying the glow was not heard.

The motion was smooth and the air was smooth too. The aircraft remained such - no jerking, no abrupt changes in the motion.

Nor do I recall any pertinent or unusual features?
And the thing that first called your attention to the object it- self, what did it resemble most closely overhead?
Now, when you observed the object itself, would you give any thoughts on its texture and that which I saw it - The object, when I first spotted it, resembled a star and I thought that was exactly what it was. As it came closer, it seemed larger and more brilliant, and somewhat oval shaped. And it assumed the vertical or 70 to 80 degree angle from the horizontal.
And that was the beginning, the air craft came from 130 to 135 degrees from the nose of the aircraft. I believe its altitude was approximately 65 to 75 degrees from the nose of the aircraft, and it was not far from the aircraft. And it was approximately the same angle, elevation, azimuth at which it disappeared. 
The object, then, disappeared on the same atl angle.

Now, I don't know what it was. I can't imagine. It was just a luminous, sudden not there.

The text in the document reads:

Were you in a position where you could watch the ground? Looking down, I did not see any ground immediately under me because the aircraft I was in was still in about a 30 degree bank, and the entire area below was black. I couldn't distinguish unless there were lights on the ground and by looking out and down, I saw this object that gave an impression as any more light when the object was sighted.

And we got in a position where we could watch it, and to the best of my knowledge, there were no obstructions in the sky; there were no clouds, there was no rain, there was nothing that could have obscured the object in any manner at the time you say this object that it must have been there.

And I can't say that the object was between you and the mountains? It was in front of the mountains and it was lower than the mountains to the north. Our position, it was illuminated more than the surrounding mountains when the object disappeared. Could you estimate the time the object disappeared? Just approximate time to the best of your knowledge-of 10 seconds. We did watch it as we started to turn, we had turned approximately 30 degrees when it disappeared.

And what happened on the turn, what direction did you observe? We had turned approximately 30 degrees, the object seemed to disappear closer to a minute or a little bit loss or a little bit more.

Regarding the time did the object seem to disappear? I would say it was about 10 seconds or longer.

And how long would that have been from the time the object first appeared to the time it disappeared? As I say, the object for not more than two seconds. I think this was very difficult to ascertain. I wouldn't have been in a position to estimate how long the object appeared.

Would you give the type and number of your aircraft? Our call sign for the flight was "drunk 33." There were five persons aboard the aircraft.

And the heading, do you recall the heading the aircraft was on at the time of this incident? The heading was 045 degrees, and the speed was 170.

And the direction of travel, is this affirmative? That is affirmative.

And regard to the date, is this April 15 April, the Zulu time would have been...? Local time was 2019 hours.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document.

In regard to light conditions, it would have been night time? 
The object was sighted briefly, it practically was a full moon out tonight. 
There were no ceiling above us. Visibility was very good. We could see the object very clearly in the sky.
At the time of the sighting, would you please, describe what you saw? There is a rapid running from La Ven, west. It makes a 90 degrees left turn and head north. 
It was something very extraordinary, we were not expecting that, when we finally established on a heading of 165 degrees.
You are a regular in the Air Force? I was commissioned in August 1954. I served three years on active duty until the end of 1957.
And your civilian occupation?
I think that will be all for the purpose of the recording. Thank you very much.

Crash, Boom Over Utah 
Fireball Lights Skies In Ten States

The large trail or flash which flashed over Utah and surrounding states at approximately 8:15 p.m. on 18 April 1962 was so brilliant that it was observed the entire length of Utah from north to south. The object was traveling from east to west. All police radio stations in Utah were flooded with calls reporting the brilliant lighting system in Eureka, Utah. The object was traveling from east to west at an estimated speed of 3,000 to 4,000 miles per hour, and was observed to break into pieces about 10 miles south of the small town of Eureka. The pieces were seen to break off in the distance toward the west.

Several minutes later, or about one minute after the sighting, a loud explosion was heard in the distance, which observers said the light was "a dazzling white."

It was seen in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, California, Nevada, Texas, Arkansas, New Mexico and Colorado. Several witnesses in southwestern Utah said it passed over them about 35 miles northwest of Delta, also said they saw it break into pieces.

At least 15 to 20 calls confirming the report were received from police and civilians in Utah, Nevada, and Colorado.

Although the identity is definitely established, the exact origin is unknown. Some persons believe it may have been a piece of Russian space debris, other persons believe it was an American satellite. The debris from this apparently was scattered all over a wide area.

Air force officers from Hill AFB at Ogden, Utah, questioned eyewitnesses to the hills south of Eureka, Utah, who said it looked like a "shooting star" but much larger and brighter.

They said it was traveling west in "sort of jerks" and was estimated to be traveling several thousand miles an hour. It suddenly grew much brighter than day, and then continued on, looking like a "vapor trail." It was estimated it was 15 to 20 miles in the distance when it suddenly exploded with a loud noise. Some of the witnesses said they could see burning pieces trailing off in the distance.

Skilled observers in Nevada declared the object was not a missile or aircraft.

The thought occurs that this object must represent high altitude fluorescence from the most extreme point of daylight brightness. It so happened that the two sides receiving most of the illumination were Utah and Nevada, both test sites.

Text from the document:

On April 13, 1962 the Air Force Detense Command was puzzled by an unidentified aerial phenomenon observed over the Rocky Mountain area. The unique distinction was being tracked by radar 90 miles southwest of Eureka, Utah. The object was observed for a period of over 30 minutes and was tracked and traced over a wide area. The Air Defense Command alert reported the object was tracked and traced over a wide area, but verification could not be made since command and control facilities were not available in the tactical area at that time. The object was tracked by radar to be as much as 40,000 feet in the Pacific hundreds of miles high.

DARLEY W. RICHARDS

AUG 10 1952

Dear Mr. 

This is in reply to your recent communication in behalf 
of his on April 15, 1952.

The same noted by him was thoroughly investigated 
by the Air Force because of the unusual amount of 
publicity given to the event and the conflicting 
circumstances indicated in the case.

Detailed studies of the depositions have led to the 
conclusion that the sighting reported last April 15 
represents an unexplained aerial phenomenon and 
detailed analysis indicates the probable reaction to be 
a viritual hoax or intentional fabrication done in the Eureka, 
Utah, Rocky Mountain area.

Our continued studies of the depositions do not warrant 
further assistance on the sighting to you or the individual 
concerned.

Sincerely,

The following occurred at Eureka, Utah in the Rocky Mountain area. 
At approximately 1950 hours MT, witness (named Herd) was afif and was climbing through 10,000 feet when he observed a light approximately 3 to 5 miles south of his position. The light was stationary and very bright, appearing to be a bluish-white color. The light remained stationary for 5 to 7 minutes. It then began to move in a straight line, gaining speed rapidly. The speed was estimated to be in excess of 5,000 mph. The light traveled approximately 25 to 30 miles in the 5 to 7 minutes it was observed moving. The witness lost sight of the light when it passed behind a mountain ridge. He stated that the light appeared to be the size of a basketball at arm's length. The weather was clear and the visibility was unlimited.

MEMORANDUM FOR CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY DIVISION, USAF

SUBJECT: Proposed Reply to [redacted]

The April 12th, 1962 event noted by [redacted] was thoroughly investigated by this Division and other appropriate government agencies. The investigation reveals that the several well-known individuals in the [redacted] area have, at different times, reported their observation of strange objects or lights in the sky. 

A detailed study of the descriptions have lead to the conclusion that the objects were a probable natural phenomena and not of extraterrestrial origin. The numerous reports gathered by the Air Force investigators do not provide evidence that would justify a further investigation under Project Blue Book procedures. 

The colored radar target reported and the 'lights' observed were determined by the Air Force investigators to be consistent with the appearances of distant aircraft lights or natural atmospheric disturbances. Interviews of the various witnesses indicated their probable location to be at a greater distance from the observers than was reported.

Many times I have seen, and again tonight, objects in the sky on night again seems real. Not as unreal as some think. Sometimes I can't find the words to describe exactly what I saw. Have seen 3 different type of objects on June 9, 1962 at approximately 11:00 p.m. in the Northern Rocky Mountain area near Eureka, Utah. I have observed these objects on many occasions and believe them to be some types of unidentified flying objects.

Dear Professor Hynek,

I received your letter and thanks for the efforts you have made in connection with the case. I was just as perplexed about the matter as you were, and I tried to find a rational explanation. However, the information that has been gathered so far indicates that an unusual object was observed in the Rocky Mountain area near Eureka, Utah, on April 8, 1962.

The details about two or three bright lights seen in the sky and their peculiar maneuvers have been reported, and it would be most helpful if you could get the opinions of your colleagues about these reports.

Sincerely,

P.S. The day my wife and I went to Vernon, we might have found someone to talk to about the report, but it seemed that information was being withheld from us. I think it may be our little outfit in the area that is being a little cautious in this matter. I do hope I can figure out a way to get more information.

Eureka, 
Utah
Dear

"Thank& very much for your recent letter and for the newspaper clipping.  I am genuinely seared to get the additional information from Mr.Gomez and now Mr. iiilcox.  I am very pleased indeed that I now have more information on this case.

It looks now as though my daughter and I will be driving down to Denver, Colorado, on Thursday, which will be the 15th, to see Mr. Wilcox as requested.  I think that this will be a good idea as my daughter can perhaps learn something more about the case.  It is my understanding that several persons have been down to see Mr. Wilcox and have been asked not to discuss the case with anyone else it trying. Naturally, I shall be very careful in my questions and perhaps you and I could arrive at a few more people.

The letter from the woman who was driving past so rapidly is also interesting, and it does indicate that there is considerably more to this case than meets the eye.  On the other hand, it would seem to have broken up and landed near them, on the other hand the reports indicate that it was observed to fall apart in the air and show' no evidence of having struck the ground.  These people were blinded by the bright light and completely unnerved by the phenomena.

Please give my best regards to Mrs. 

Cordially,

Output of text found in the document:

When observed through a spotting telescope (zoom approximately 20X), the object appeared to be round, very bright, and about the size of a dinner plate held at arm's length. It remained stationary for several minutes, then suddenly disappeared. A noise like that of a jet aircraft was heard nearly simultaneously with the object's disappearance.

The object was first observed at 2256 MST on 1961-03-31 by XXXX XXXXX, a geophysicist employed by The XXXXX Corporation, while driving alone on a road near EUREKA, Utah, in the ROCKY MOUNTAIN area. XXXXX stated that he was looking for an aircraft after being alerted by a radio report of a bright light in the area. The object was observed for approximately 2 minutes and 15 seconds.

XXXXX described the object as round, approximately the size of a dinner plate held at arm's length, and very bright - almost blinding to look at directly. It appeared to be hovering stationary approximately 2000 yards distant and at an estimated altitude of 1000 feet. No details of the object's surface could be discerned.

Shortly after the object disappeared, a sound like that of a jet aircraft was heard. XXXXX stated that the sound appeared to originate from the area where the object had been observed.

XXXXX is considered a reliable and competent observer. He is a professional scientist who has had considerable experience in the observation and identification of various types of aircraft. He stated that the object was definitely not an aircraft, satellite, or other known aerial object.

Text extracted from the document:

13.2(!) manner of observation - Visual,day.
13.2(2) optical aids - None.
13.2(3) Duration examining - 7/7/59.
13.2(4) date time-date group - 0315, 19 April 1952.
13.2(5) location - Eureka, Utah.
13.2(6) weather conditions - Hazy.
Incident Location:- Eureka, Utah - Rocky Mountain area, near Salt Lake City, Utah. Information received from witnesses indicates that they observed a bright, oval-shaped object with a blinking red light on the side, approximately 1000 feet in altitude. The object hovered for a few minutes, then moved away to the Southwest at a high rate of speed, disappearing from sight. They stated that the object was very bright and clearly visible, and that they had never observed anything like it before. They felt that the object was definitely not an aircraft. The witnesses are considered reliable, and there is no indication that they were mistaken in their observation.

The 13.2(12) case was assigned to him with a request the details of the case in an effort to have information available concerning sightings of this type. Please advise whether file contains sufficient data to close.

(1) 13.2(1) size - The size of a lemon, that is, the size of a tangerine or a small round object.
(2) 13.2(2) The color - the color was white, a bright white color.
(3) 13.2(3) Number - One.
(4) 13.2(4) Duration - 10 mins.
As described, the appearance is suggestive of a description of something in the sky which appears to be intelligently controlled. The details given indicate a bright, white, oval or spherical object, size of a tangerine, which hovered for about 10 mins and then departed at high speed. This is similar to many sightings of unidentified flying objects. While the description given is not detailed enough to permit a conclusive identification, it is sufficient to warrant the classification of "Unidentified" and the inclusion of this report in Project Blue Book files.

MEMORANDUM FOR CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY DIVISION, SAFLI

SUBJECT: Proposed reply to 

The April 13th, 1962 event noted by Mr. was thoroughly investigated by the USAF. This unusual sighting of multiple objects from several well-regarded individuals in the Eureka, Leamington, and Silver City, Utah areas was examined in detail. An attempt was made to locate and interview various witnesses indicated their sightings, but this was not fully accomplished due to the time elapsed and normal difficulties in such investigations.

Detailed study of the depositions have led to the conclusion that the "Cascade" type explosion was witnessed and is regarded the essence of the various sightings reported - the big explosion followed unidentified flying objects.

Lt Colonel Herr and Dr. J. Allen Hynek conducted the investigation for the Air Force. Detailed reports are on file in this case.

UFO SIGHTING, LYNNDYL, UTAH
19 April 1962

This is a recording concerning an unidentified flying object, sighted on 19 April 1962 at 5:00 hours in Lynndyl, Utah.

For the purpose of the recording, would you give your full name and address?

And could I have your age and occupation, sir? And a certain description of the object. Could you describe what you saw in connection with it? My age is 31 and I am a farmer, 3rd of December, and last...

With regard to the shape of the object you saw last evening, would you describe more or less a tight (?) form, maybe a little wider than round, but it seemed to all be on fire. 

This, with regard to the size, would compare it to about the size of a basketball or smaller? Now, smaller, the size of a baseball, or what? Well, I believe it was a little larger than that, but due to the flightiness and its swiftness, I couldn't tell exactly.

What was the color of the object? It looked a little blue in the white, and that's about what it looked like, more or less, burning metal. But it was so hot.

And there was only the one object? Yes, this one object.

Were there any discernible features? Not that I could see.

Was there any trail or vapor trail behind it, such as you would see on some aircraft contrails? And what was the duration? I imagine that it would be about 500 feet and approximately that it could have been a little longer, if it could have been, if it wasn't causing the heat, the heat passed through and left the flame. Then it wasn't out and it was a smooth trail.

What first called your attention to the object?
I had a floodlight on and suddenly the whole surrounding area was lit up. This lighted up the whole surrounding area.
It was 143, the whole valley.
When you observed the object, at what angle in the sky was it coming?
It was traveling northwest from where I was standing. 
When you first observed the object, what did you think it was?
I thought it was directly overhead as it seemed to be coming from the north.
When it was approaching from the south, at what angle were you observing it?
I imagine it was just about a 45 degree angle, just about overhead.
How high do you estimate the object was above you at this time?
From 3-500 feet.
You mentioned that it went to the Northwest. Would this be correct?
Yes, it did go to the Northwest. More north than west.
How did the object disappear? Did it fade out gradually or did it just disappear all at once?
It disappeared all at once. It was light and then it was dark.
And do you have any idea what time this was?
Charter after eight, maybe twenty minutes after eight.

And at night time, what were the weather conditions? The sky was clear and the stars shined and the moon was out. Were there any clouds? Light accumula­tion of clouds, very light, though.
And the location where you were in the yard, would you call this the center of town? The north end of town.
I think that will be all the information we require for the report.

OCR Text Output:
UFO SIGHTING AT 4.41 PM, UTAH
13 APRIL 1962

This investigation in accordance with AFR 200-2 is the result of a report of a UFO sighting in the Eureka, Utah area on 13 April 1962. This report was forwarded to Douglas Co., Colorado, and was assigned to the Colorado Division of the Project Blue Book, which would you give you some additional information.

On 13 April 1962 at approximately 4:41 pm, a Mr. and Mrs. Gordon L. Smith of 640 South 8th West, Eureka, Utah, stated they saw a very bright light or object in the sky to the south west. This object first appeared as a bright light and then the object itself. We were informed that at the time they first saw the object, the sun was shining brightly and the sky was clear. 

The object, according to their statement, was approximately 2 miles west of their location, was estimated to be about 20 to 30 feet in diameter, and was shaped like a disc or ellipse. The color was bright white or silver and the light was very intense, almost blinding. The object appeared to be hovering and was emitting a dim reddish glow. They watched the object for about 5 minutes and it then disappeared rather abruptly, in a downward motion. Mr. Smith stated that the object made no noise and left no trail.

The investigating officer could not account for the source of the light. The intensity and brilliance of the light was such that it could not be the sun or any known aircraft. Various aircraft flying in the vicinity were checked and eliminated as the source. The investigators could find no reasonable explanation for the sighting. They could not determine the nature, identity, or origin of the object. The case was classified as "unidentified".
