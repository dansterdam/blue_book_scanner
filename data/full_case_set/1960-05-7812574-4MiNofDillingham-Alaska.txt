The text in the document is as follows:

See Photos That they are supposed to be saucers Typical of the many reports received from the area of Dillingham, Alaska. The sighting was made at approximately 20:00 hours (8:00 PM) on May 7, 1960. The weather was clear and the object was observed for about 1-2 minutes before disappearing behind a mountain. The object was described as round, metallic in appearance, and much larger than any known aircraft. It was estimated to be about 50-100 feet in diameter and traveling at a very high rate of speed, much faster than any known aircraft. The observer called the local Air Force installation to report the sighting and was advised that it was probably a meteor or weather balloon. However, the observer was convinced that what he saw was neither a meteor nor a weather balloon, but rather an unidentified flying object. The case was forwarded to Project Blue Book for further investigation.

The image contains a diagram that depicts the path of an object ascending at a certain point. The diagram shows a "RIDGE" and the "PATH OF OBJECT" ascending from a point labeled "DILLINGHAM" to a point labeled "ASCENDED AT THIS POINT". The distance from Dillingham to the ascension point is noted as "1-2 Mi (APP)".

The Alaska National Guard, did not see the object, but saw the other persons who reported the sighting. According to the report, only one other person than those listed below who saw it at close range. In a town the size of Dillingham, this is probably the only other witness but we have given the names of those who saw it.
He, the observer, saw the object at close range. He is a Deaf-mute native and communicated by signs, but was not personally contacted. The following account was given by his brother which they said was based on his instructions. It was stated that it was creating considerable suction, in fact, enough to pick up two empty 55 gallon drums, and after it had passed, four or five were blown down. He was afraid they would be sucked up. The object passed about 50 to 100 feet from him, and passed close overhead in such a way that he could look right into the door, or open window, to the other houses, a distance of possibly 100 yards. The object passed between the houses and made no noise. (Figure 1) As the object lifted high into the air after it, it seemed to just go straight up. It had a red light on the trailing end. The light around the object gave a glow about 2 to 3 inches around the object, not an intense glow, but was more of a steady glow. There was a red band on the object (about 2 inches wide) around the middle section. There was also, in the center, bottom, a half moon shaped object which whirled at a high velocity. The object ascended gradually as if it was under control. Although the motions and appendages and half moon changed, it was because of language difficulties. It was impossible to determine what the object consisted of. The object was about as big as an automobile and was silver in color. According to the instructions, it was difficult to assess the reliability of these persons but it is probably at least average. Considerable noise was caused by the blowing of the 55 gallon drums, but there was no communication with the object.
Another possible witness was a man who said he had seen the object, but he was then living in an outlying village and had not heard about the sighting until several days later. He stated that he had seen the object.
The sighting occurred on 20/05/50, May 1950. He is the proprietor of a pool hall and barber shop in Dillingham and was standing at the rear window of his establishment. He noticed the object approximately 1/4 or 1/2 mile away near the bridge and approximately paralleling the ridge. He described the object as very bright and appeared to be elongated. He said the object was visible for approximately 10 to 15 seconds and then disappeared. He had not brought binoculars. From the window there is a clear view of the ridge and horizon.

SECURITY INFORMATION
ORIGINATING AGENCY: Hq. 10th Air Division (Def)
SUBJECT: The reliability is difficult to estimate, but he was not evasive and some details of his story correlated with that of the sighting is difficult to explain.
DETAILS: The sighting is a light plane at 2500 feet near Ekuk, south of Dillingham at 9:00/9:30, 1960-05-07. The pilot stated he saw an object on the ground looking up and that it was about 10,000 feet and nearly above him. He stated it was round and silver, with a metallic appearance, much smaller than a small aircraft. The object was in view for about a minute and a half. As the object rose, it made a semi-circular or vertical ascent, then a slight horizontal pass. The incident balloon flight noted over Japan during WWII. He could give no other details. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: At the time of the sighting, the weather was gusty and the object was headed in a breeze of about 15 miles per hour and that the object seemed pretty much into the wind. The pilot also stated some distance perception, but it did seem somewhat larger than a "full moon." The 735th ACWRON at King Salmon picked up a contact at that time, but it was almost due south of Dillingham over the village of Ekuk. The 705th ACWRON at Dillingham also picked up a contact at about 0545 PA 5050, contact lost and faded.
COMMENTS BY INVESTIGATING OFFICER: There still appears to be no logical explanation of the sighting. It is quite obvious that an object was sighted; whether all the details of the sighting are correct cannot be ascertained, however, there is no reason to doubt their essential accuracy. At any rate, it does not appear that a conventional aircraft or balloon was responsible for the sighting.
