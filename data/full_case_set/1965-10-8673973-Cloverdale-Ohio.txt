1. Reference the attached report of an unidentified flying object. The object observed on 27 October 1965 was probably caused by the planet Venus which was in the southwestern sky at that time under conditions favorable for optical distortion. This placed the planet at or near the horizon at 240 degrees azimuth.

2. The Air Force Museum is open to the public Monday through Saturday from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Sunday from 1 P.M. to 5 P.M.

3. The attached brochures will help explain the objectives and results of Project Blue Book. We believe evidence is conclusive that interplanetary vehicles do not exist, although some unidentified flying objects exist as interpanetary vehicles.

Gentlemen:

I wish to report the sighting of a flying object which my Dad and I made on the evening of Oct. 20, 1965. The object was in the west in about the 7:30 position. It made no sound at all and was orange in color. The object appeared to move north a distance of about 50 miles and then it just disappeared.

Please advise dates & time your museum is open to the public. Is it true that you have understood flight objects? If so, please give me information including a self addressed stamped envelope. Thank you.
