TO     AFCIN-4E4  ATTN: Capt. Gregory    FROM   AFCIN-4E2
1. Reference is made to discussions between Captain Gregory relative to the meteorite sample in the possession of your organization.
2. The sample in our possession is unquestionably a meteorite, but appears to be somewhat identifiable. An examination in this case would have no scientific value from the standpoint of UFO.
3. Although there has been a bit of study of meteorites in connection with heat-transfer as applied to guided missiles, these studies have been made on general meteoroid problems and not specifically on this meteorite. For this reason this sample will be submitted to White Stork.
4. Disposition analysis does not appear warranted, since all of the story categories fall into the same category. The Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., can furnish the general analysis of all story type meteorites.
5. Dr. H.H. Nininger, Assistant Meteorite Museum, Denver, Colorado, could make full assessment to assure the monetary value of this meteorite.
6. A full report will be furnished your office on receipt from White Stork.

WITNESS: Mr & Mrs. Richard T. Plummer 
ADDRESS: Shiloh, Ohio

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:

On the evening of June 30, 1957, at approximately 9:30 p.m., Mr. and Mrs. Richard T. Plummer observed an unidentified flying object while driving along Route 224 near Shiloh, Ohio. The object was described as a dull reddish-orange color, round in shape, and approximately 25-30 feet in diameter. It was observed for approximately 3 minutes before disappearing from view.

INVESTIGATOR'S REPORT:

The Plummers were interviewed on 15 July 1957. They stated that the object was at an altitude of approximately 600 feet and moved in a horizontal direction at a constant speed. No sound was heard, and no trail or exhaust was visible. The object appeared to be self-luminous.

The Plummers claim to have taken a photograph of the object, but the quality of the print is poor and does not clearly show the object. A copy of the photograph is attached.

ALLEGED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORTED BY F. A. HARTMAN

On July 6, 1957, Mr. F. A. Hartman of Shiloh, Ohio, reported that he had observed an unidentified flying object near his home.

Mr. Hartman stated that at approximately 10:30 p.m. on the evening of July 6, 1957, he was outdoors in his backyard when he observed a bright, luminous object moving in the sky. He described the object as oval-shaped and bluish-white in color. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes as it slowly moved across the sky in a northerly direction.

According to Mr. Hartman's report, the object appeared to be approximately the size of a basketball when viewed from his position. He also noted that the object seemed to give off a soft, luminous glow and made no sound as it moved through the sky.

Mr. Hartman's report was investigated by the U.S. Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, the official study of unidentified flying objects conducted by the U.S. government. However, the investigation was unable to determine the exact nature or origin of the object observed by Mr. Hartman.

REPORT NO. 14
6960412
SHILOH, OHIO, JULY, 1957

On July 6, 1957, at approximately 9:55 p.m. EST, several persons observed an unidentified aerial object in the sky over Shiloh, Ohio. The witnesses, all adults, were engaged in a religious service at a church near Shiloh when they observed the object.

The object was described as round or oval in shape, and illuminated. It was observed to be traveling in a straight line in a northwest to southeast direction at what was estimated to be a very high speed. The object was visible for approximately 3 to 4 minutes before disappearing from view.

Investigation of this incident by Air Force personnel failed to disclose any evidence that the object observed was an aircraft, missile, or natural phenomenon. The case therefore remains classified as an "unidentified" under Project Blue Book.

The image appears to show a photograph or illustration of a large, irregularly shaped rock or geological formation. The image is black and white, and the rock formation appears to have a rough, textured surface with various cracks and crevices visible. There are no human figures or other identifiable elements in the image.

Shiloh Sept 16
Mr. Capt. Oliver R. Hill
Sir:
On 8:30 P.M. some time ago Jill Dobbins and myself saw a metallic disc-like object hovering motionless for some considerable time. I had no camera with me to take a picture. The object rose vertically at a tremendous speed and disappeared from view.
I notified the Air Force at Dayton, Ohio and had an interview with them but they seem to be rather skeptical about the report.
As I have not had any previous experience I would appreciate any information or assistance you could give me in regard to this matter. As they here do not seem to be too interested in such matters, I would be grateful if you would give the incident some consideration.
Thank you

Dear Mr. Searcy:

In response to your letter of 16 September regarding the object which was kindly sent to me, I wish to advise that the investigation has now been completed.

The object which at first glance appeared to be a meteorite. However, after careful examination, it was found not to be a meteorite but most probably a volcanic bomb.

As the stone is not a meteorite, we feel that it is not worth a further investigation and that it should be returned to you.

We shall hold the stone pending instructions from you regarding its disposition.

The Air Force wishes to extend its appreciation for your assistance and cooperation in this matter.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document that contains text only, describing the examination of a stone.

EXAMINATION OF A STONE

A large, black stone, reported to be a stony meteorite, was received for examination, particularly from the standpoint of aerodynamic lines of flow. 

The stone shows no signs of air-flow lines such as are found on meteorites. The markings visible on the surface of the stone represent material in the bedding planes of a sedimentary rock; this material has a hardness somewhat greater than that of the matrix.

The aerodynamic flow lines have an appearance and arrangement that are completely different from the markings on the stone in question. On a meteorite, flow lines would not protrude so far from the surface; they would be arranged to slide from the front and rear elongation points. A joint or crack region would be recognized. The front face would be smooth, with protuberances either melted off or with characteristic pits in front of them and behind them. The back face would show a typical molted appearance due to chilling pitching. In none of these characteristics does the stone in question resemble a meteorite.

The stone is clearly of sedimentary origin. It shows bedding planes with pebbles at least one of the planes is clearly granular. It is concluded that the stone is indurated due to some inhomogeneity at the center, possibly a fossil, as is commonly observed in the sandstones found in the eastern part of Ohio. Weathering has removed the softer formation around the stone, leaving pebbles and induration between layers of the indurated sandstone, in the fashion.

The matrix material is surprised to be a feldspathic sandstone.

In composition, the rock does not resemble a meteorite; there is no granite in such bodies, but usually unaltered, olivine, forsterite, etc. are present. Meteorites do not contain pebbles.
