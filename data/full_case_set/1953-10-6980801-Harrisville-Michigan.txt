AF FORM 112 - PART B
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PAGE 1 OF 1 PAGES
On 6 October 1953, at 0930 EST, a citizen of Harrisville, Michigan, reported sighting an unknown flying object approximately 3/4 mile south of that town.  the observer stated that the object was traveling in a generally southward direction at an altitude of about 20,000 feet.  When first sighted, the object appeared to be spinning or rotating, and it could be described as a brilliant light, a luminous disc, or a semiballoon-like craft.  The object was observed for approximately 6 to 7 seconds before being lost from sight.
The local radar station reports that no target corresponding to the object was detected on their scopes at the time of sighting.  Weather at the time of sighting was clear with twenty to thirty miles visibility.
