UNCLASSIFIED

Subject: "Aerial Phenomena", dated 19 Jan 51, File ID 21-0

The driver of the second car came back to our car and stated that he had been watching these lights and had never seen anything like it before. These lights over the highway appeared to be 1000 feet and on a vertical plane. Two of the lights were green and the third light was red, forming a triangle. There was three of these triangles in the groups over the highway, making one large triangle. We looked to the east, off highway and could see another triangle. We saw three lights approximately three to five hundred yards to the east, and to the west we noticed three to four groups of lights arranged in two square areas. The lights at each end in two to seven hundred yards to the west of the main group over the highway. We stood outside the car and observed these lights, which were stationary at first. After a short while we noticed that the group of lights or the highway began moving north in the direction of Fort Worth, Texas and we estimated the speed of these lights to be 100 miles per hour or less. These green lights appeared to be moving to the north followed by the red lights. We looked at the group of lights in the east. They had also started to now north toward Fort Worth. The group of lights on the west appeared to be moving toward Fort Worth, but travelling at a speed of approximately two thirds that of the group over the highway. We noticed that the group of lights to the east of the highway and to the west of the highway appeared to be on a horizontal plane. These lights did not blink and resembled the lights on a water tower or radio antenna. As these lights moved away a sound resembling an outboard motor trolling in the distance could be heard. We observed these lights for approximately five minutes and from our observation, agreed that the distance between the lights in each of the smaller triangles was ten to fifteen feet. Knowing the several air lanes were in the vicinity of our location, we did not introduce ourselves to the man in the other car but drove on toward Waco. The other automobile was a 1946 or 1943 Plymouth coupe with a National Guard tag on the rear license plate. This person stated to us that he was just coming from a National Guard meeting. We noticed that shortly after driving off, this National Guardsman turned to the left off the main highway and therefore, we assumed that he lived in that immediate vicinity. He had been in Fort Worth on business and had not touched as much as one bottle of beer."
