Text transcribed from the document:

Made Thursday, a friend and I observed a peculiar experience.

We were about 2 miles northeast of Zanesville, Ohio. Going in a test about two hundred (200) feet from the highway house. We were attracted down the road by the peculiar movement of grass and leaves in a circle about fifteen feet in diameter. This peculiar movement was observed for about one minute.

At the next moment observed a very dim beam of light on the ground a few feet in front of the grass was stopped, it seemed to disappear with a flash. I wondered if it was connected with the movement of the grass. I only had the flash light of the family. We drove into the tent and remained out, went back outside and showed them up the movement that was in the grass. I then turned my flashlight on the grass and there was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. There were no tracks in the grass and no disturbance whatsoever than what we had observed with our eyes. I would like to know your opinion on what we saw.

Yours truly,
[Redacted], Ohio

The image contains two sketches or illustrations, but no photographic image. The larger sketch appears to be a compass rose or navigation diagram with directional labels. The smaller sketches depict an individual standing in a landscape with a saucer-shaped object in the sky.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN X AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A CIRCLE AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. THEN, DRAW ARROWS INDICATING THE MOTION OR DIRECTION OF TRAVEL OF THE PHENOMENON, AND NOTE THE ELEVATION AND AZIMUTH OF THE LARGER SKETCH.

Here is the text from the document, produced by an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system:

APPARENT NATURE OF OBJECT: IT SEEMED TO BE A FUZZY GRAYISH COLORED OBJECT, ROUND IN SHAPE. IT MOVED RAPIDLY FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. IT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 1000 YARDS AWAY AND ABOUT 1000 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.

CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING OBSERVATION: I WAS RIDING IN A CAR WITH MY WIFE AND CHILDREN WHEN THIS OBJECT WAS OBSERVED. IT WAS ABOUT 10:30 PM ON JUNE 29, 1968. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND THE SKY WAS CLOUDLESS.

HOW LONG OBJECT OBSERVED: APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 10 SECONDS.

EXPLANATION SOUGHT: THE OBJECT MOVED SO RAPIDLY THAT IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. I COULD NOT IDENTIFY IT AS ANY KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT OR VEHICLE. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SOME TYPE OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

DID YOU NOTICE ANY DOOR, HATCH, OR REAL EMANATIONS FROM THE OBJECT OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF?
NO.

DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT THE SIGHTING BE FOLLOWED UP BY FURTHER INVESTIGATION?
YES, I WOULD RECOMMEND FURTHER INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS IF POSSIBLE.
