This information was not previously reported to this office and was withheld from publication until today as the official clearance of the image and data was withheld.

To Capt. James H. REASON, Director of the Project, a report from Julio R.

The incident is considered Important in Chile, was the observers. As the observer was considered reliable and responsible in security matters, and not subject to hallucinations or sensation, the report is considered of sefficient merit to warrant a request from this Agency for further investigation.
