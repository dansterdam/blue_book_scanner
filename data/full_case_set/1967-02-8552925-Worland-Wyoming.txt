BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Observers watched a round ball of light that appeared about the size of a grapefruit at arm's length. The light was observed to have a pulsing or flashing effect. The light was noted in the north-northwest sky and appeared stationary at times. This object was observed for about 5 minutes.

A family in Worland reporting that they had launched a total of nine hot air balloons on the previous evening. This may explain the object observed.

Feb. 16, 1967
Major Richard Mathews
OSAMA (CSIDED)
Hill Air Force Base, Utah:

Dear Major:

After reading the article in the Worland, Wyoming newspaper. I decided it best to clarify the report. As you know, the Western UFO Command recently had an interesting encounter and it seems I have been chosen to help. On the night of the 11th, they were quite successful. Our daughter, who is an enthusiastic member, was on the scene. The light was overpowering, but as it moved away the earth was enveloping in a bluish mist. On the following morning C2 people called at our house, when the encounter Mother said Dad had for their guests. We appreciate your thoughts and he asked me to tell you this saves you further trouble.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
