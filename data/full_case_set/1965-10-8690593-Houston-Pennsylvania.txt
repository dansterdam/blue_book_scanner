Text from the document:

They flew as if they turned or angled to one end as they paused then angled to the other end as they paused. This action was repeated in a continuous motion.

Watchers on the ground with lights about 1/2 mile distant saw this motion. It was dark and raining. The object appeared to be 3 feet or more in diameter and seemed to be a whitish or silvery color. The motion was round-a-bout between the two ends as it paused. It seemed no more than 1,000 ft. above the ground and was observed for about 10 minutes.
