The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document about strange lights observed in Rapid City, South Dakota on October 12, 1962. The text of the document is as follows:

STRANGE LIGHTS IN RAPID CITY, S. D.
On Thursday, 12 Oct. 62, a report was received from Rapid City, S. D. regarding the observation of strange lights. The weather was clear, and there was no investigation by the authorities. The witness, a resident of Scotchbluf, Nebraska, said what he thought of a meteore was a greenish-white light that was "half as large as a bus" as he estimated it. The light traveled at about 3/4 mile per second and disappeared behind some hills just north of the town. Search parties were sent out, but they could find nothing. The hills where the lights were observed are about 100 feet high. Search later on also proved fruitless.
