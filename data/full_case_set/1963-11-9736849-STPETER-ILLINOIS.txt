Gentlemen:

I am writing this letter for two reasons, to give and to receive information. It would like to be known as a result of a close encounter of a unique nature that you are making or have made in the past.

All I was driving south on Route 155, about 9 miles northwest of St. Peter, Illinois, on November 24, 1963 A.D. at approximately 7:30 P.M. I noticed in the sky, a luminous object that was not a star. As I continued to observe it, it made a series of maneuvers that eliminated the possibility of it being a satellite or meteor. It appeared to be metallic in nature and was giving off its own luminous glow. At one point, it seemed to become almost a small disc-like shape, then changed back to the elongated object that I first observed. At times, it would seem to blink out altogether, then reappear. The movements were not those of a conventional aircraft, but more like the movements one might expect from an unconventional aircraft or an unusual aerial phenomenon.

I would like to know if you have any information on file regarding any unusual aerial sightings or phenomena that may have occurred in this general area around the date and time I have mentioned. I would also like to know if there are any investigative agencies of the Air Force or other branches of the government that specialize in the investigation of such phenomena. I am very curious to know if this sighting is part of a pattern of similar sightings that may have occurred in this region.

So much for my observation. Now, I would like to know some things about the Air Force's observations. I have always been fascinated by the possibility of the existence of extra-terrestrial life. However, I have a great deal of respect for the work that you and other scientific agencies are doing. I would like to know, if I may, what your official position is on the possibility of extra-terrestrial life and its visitation to our planet. I realize that this is a sensitive area and that you may not be able to divulge certain information. However, I would appreciate any general comments you might be able to make.

I want to know what you think about the caliber and credentials of those individuals who claim to have done such a good job of contacting extra-terrestrials. I am burning at to hear your views on the validity and reliability of such claims. I am also curious to know if your agency has any first-hand experience in this area that you might be able to share.

I realize that dealing with the public on matters of this nature can sometimes be a delicate task. However, I assure you that my interest is a sincere one, and I would greatly appreciate any information or insights you might be able to provide. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

Finally, I would like to ask about the object you saw on the night of October 5, 1963. At what does the object appear to be? What was the interior make up? 
What was the interior make up or the exterior make up? 
What was the lighting of the interior make up of the object?
Were any color seen the object? 
It is there any form of this was can be graphically delineated similar interim
It is there any form of this was can be graphically delineated similar interim
My sincere thanks for being of assistance to me. (T-IF 8)

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDXL

2 DEC 1963

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information

1. HQ USAF SAR-OFFR (Mrs. Salivar)

2. Forwards the attached letter from dated 14 Nov 63, requesting information on unidentified flying objects.

a. The report indicates a sighting was made - the objects without extra lights are quite numerous, also, the objects are consistent with a nuclear vehicle hovering above the surface of a lake or the ocean.

b. All satellite decays have an easterly component, i.e. the objects were not satellites.

c. Decay is characteristic by a breaking up of the object and its slower descent or ascent.

d. The duration is much greater than a meteor sighting. For example, sightings of Spanish IV satellite in excess of two minutes. The Apollo re-entry decay in 1962 was observed from Florida to Maine and lasted in excess of 5 minutes.

e. In a case summary of the 1 Aug 1963 sighting in Fairfield, Illinois it was noted that the sighting could not be satisfactorily explained.

f. At no time did the Air Force attempt to discourage Mrs. regarding this sighting. However, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons for our evaluation of the sightings. Normally, established criteria and/or observations preclude any other explanation.

g. There are many reasons for static on a radar set, for example: electrical disturbances, temperature inversions, or ground returns from mountains and buildings. No association was established between the UFO and static in this case.

h. The Air Force has no information regarding a "settling instant" in relation to this case.

The text in the document reads as follows:

1. The object found in the creek bed by M/Sgt P________ was turned over to the officials from G2-USAF. It was determined that it was not radioactive. It appears to be a specific type of glass or quarts crystal according to the quantities.

a. The object is a rock.

b. It has never been in outer space.

c. Yes, we have inspected the object.

d. The interior is made of silicon compounds.

e. No gold was present.

f. There were no remains of radioactive compounds inside. 

g. Yes, there were calcite and silicon compounds present.

h. It does not seem to be to determine its specific gravity.

5. The exterior layer is iron pyrite, the interior or center is composed of silicon.

g. No answer.

h. The object was not radioactive.

Nothing in this document is classified. For the commander.

The report is dated 9 November 1963 and is from St. Peter, Illinois.

The text found in the document is as follows:

"December 6, 1963

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

Referring to your letter of November 16, 1963, and information from your form for 9/29/63, your sighting was undoubtedly a meteor. However, messors [REDACTED] with a meeting attending on 11/30, the sightings up to that point seemed to be colored lights, and this was the subject of the meeting.

1. All satellite devices leaving an easterly component;
2. Decay is phenomenized by a breaking up or the object tends to be sad up change;
3. Duration of satellite is much greater than the passing of two minutes, for example, Sputnik IV launched for 4300 of seconds was our attention toward a passing meteor.

A case summary of the August 4, 1963 sighting is attached. At no time did the Air Force attempt to identify aircraft in the sighting however, certain it was not an airplane or any other type of aircraft known to the Air Force. The evaluation shows this sighting was too difficult to determine its exact nature. I did not see them.

For example: Aircraft flying overheard at varying altitudes cannot be identified at times, but the Air Force has no information on "guiding incising" in relation to this case."

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

The object found in the creek bed by Mr. Jacks is an aluminum object and was originally reported to this time as a fragment of a wrecked aircraft. At the present it is being held for examination. Your letter are as follows:

a. The object is a rock.
b. It has never been in outer space.
c. Yes, we have pleased the object.
d. The interior is made of silicon compounds.
e. No gold was present.
f. There were no remains of resinous compounds inside.
g. Yes, there were calcium and silicon compounds present.
h. No test was made to determine its specific gravity.
i. The exterior layer is iron pyrite, the interior or center is composed of CACOS + SIO2.
j. No answer.
k. The object was not radioactive.

Nothing in this letter is considered classified.
