1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 17 c-8-52 - 53 19/10/52
2. LOCATION: Windsor, Nfld.
3. SOURCE: ATIC 16-43
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 to 15 min.
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: visual
7. COURSE: 325
8. PHOTOS: No
9. PHYS: 19 Oct flares
10. CONCLUSION: Though all observations tend to fit the pattern of a Saturnoid-type object, the possibility of a meteor or distant flare cannot be eliminated. The object was under observation for about 15 minutes, during which time it remained stationary at first, then moved very rapidly on a straight course to the north-northwest before disappearing. It appeared to be a bright bluish-white object, flaring and pulsating at irregular intervals.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: The object observed apparently remained stationary for a considerable period of time, and when it did move, it traveled at a very high rate of speed on a straight course. The object appeared to be a bright bluish-white in color, flaring and pulsating at irregular intervals.
