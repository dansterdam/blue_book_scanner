a dark oval object a bright light inside, accompanied by a glowing ting or tail which appeared to be descending slowly and silently towards observer. The object was first sighted in the northwest and traveled in a straight line southeast. It appeared 2 or 3 times as large as the stars, brighter than the stars and much bigger than the satellites that are normally observed. It was probably 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon. To the observors it was a most impressive display, almost dreamlike in its slow silent descent.

21. IS THERE ANY GOOD NOISE OR HEAT SENSATION FROM THE PHENOMENON OR ANY EFFECT ON YOURSELF, ANIMALS, ELECTRICAL OR MAGNETIC INSTRUMENTS?
ANSWER: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. NO SOUND, NO HEAT, NO PHYSICAL EFFECTS.

SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA QUESTIONNAIRE
THIS QUESTIONNAIRE IS BEING USED TO DETERMINE THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTINGS.
ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS CAREFULLY AND COMPLETELY TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY. REPORT ALL FACTS AS YOU ACTUALLY WITNESSED THEM. ANY STATEMENTS OR SKETCHES SHOULD BE AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE.

Based on the text in the document, the sighting occurred on DAY 17 MONTH MARCH YEAR 1969. The observer last sighted the phenomenon at 7:00 HOUR 30 MINUTE and the duration of the sighting was approximately 1 MINUTE. The location is listed as CENTRAL. Under the diagram, the observer has provided a drawing and handwritten notes describing the relative position of the observed phenomenon.

- page 10 -

The image contains a compass-like diagram in the top half and two landscape sketches in the bottom half. The compass diagram appears to be used to indicate the direction of an observed phenomenon. The two landscape sketches depict an aerial view of a landscape, possibly from the perspective of the observer.

Text extracted from the image:
6. HOW INCHES YOUR HEAD? 6" SHOW DIRECTION WHEN FIRST SEEN, PLACE "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON. 

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. DRAW A LINE CONNECTING THESE TWO POINTS. THIS WILL SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT WAS IN A STRAIGHT LINE OR WHETHER IT WAS ERRATIC. ALSO INDICATE BY ARROW THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT AND SPEED IF KNOWN.

13 March 1969

SUBJECT: 12 March 1969 call from Ronald T. Lumpkin

On 12 March 1969, DRT (UFO) received a call from Ronald T. Lumpkin, who stated he observed two objects that looked like stars. One object was brighter than the other. Mr. Lumpkin stated the objects were stationary for approximately 20 to 30 minutes. The objects then started moving very rapidly and were lost from sight. The elevation of the dinner object was originally 25°, then 30°. The objects were first observed at the following address:
