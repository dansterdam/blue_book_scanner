10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: The U.S. Army soldiers on
prior patrol reported that they observed a very bright, fuzzy light to the west. The light was circular in shape, about 20 feet in diameter and maneuvered erratically. On 2nd patrol they observed it again, closer this time, and it appeared to pulsate and change colors from white to red and back again. The sighting was observed for about 2 hours. The observers determined that they had discussed with others, including their commanders, the peculiarities of the sighting before sighting it again. The incident was classified as a POSSIBLE AIRCRAFT.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, which describes an incident involving the sighting of two "E-M and Non-E-M Saucers" near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The text provides details about the sighting, including the size, shape, and movement of the objects, as well as their potential connection to the planet Venus. The document also mentions the reactions and responses of the military police and local residents to the incident.

E-M and Non-E-M Saucers

The next UFOs reported in this series belong to the old-fashioned, non-E-M variety: From White Sands Proving Grounds near Alamogordo, New Mexico, came a report that military police, while patrolling the range in a Jeep about a ago Sunday, were surprised to sight an orange light, shaped like an egg, hovering in the sky. From its apparent distance (two to three miles away) and apparent size (as large as a grapefruit held at arm's length), the observers deduced that it was larger than 150 to 175 feet in diameter. It descended slowly towards the ground and disappeared. (According to some versions, it later rose into the air again and disappeared.) Members of another Jeep patrol, about three miles away, also reported seeing the object at about eight o'clock; they said it was a bright, glowing object hovering in the sky but, instead of landing, it suddenly climbed until it got so far up it looked like a star. Both, however, should be noted, continued to function normally.

The White Sands incident again dampened the excitement. The description of the light that appeared at 2:30 A.M. included certain doubtful features. The night had been overcast and so dark that the officers said the light appeared brighter than the stars. It made two or three distinct stops or reversals. Since the sighting had not included any object of known distance or size for comparison, the estimates of the UFO's distance and size were of no value. The light might have been small and close or larger and farther away. The White Sands explanation was that the men had glimpsed the moon (then roughly half full) through broken clouds, and that the apparent movement was due to fluctuations in the clouds. An unquestionably the planet Venus. They nearly at maximum brilliance. It was a conspicuous object in the western sky after sunset and inspired many saucer reports during this week of anxiety.

The White Sands incidents had reached the papers, however, and by Monday afternoon, flying saucers were allegedly stopping automobiles as far north as Cannon Air Force Base. But the Southwest continued to hold the center of the UFO stage against all competition.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM AGENCY: AIRS
TO: ATIC, WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB, OHIO

I. SOURCE: Cpt. Clmrm H. Tayt, RA 12312460
ADDRESSEE: U.S. ARMY Garrison, White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico

AGE: 21
OCCUPATION: Motor Patrol, Military Police
EDUCATION: Half or tenth grade

II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: Source appeared to be a "typical G.I.," naive and impressed with "unusual and impressive" objects he had observed. He was a member of the Army military patrol, and according to his own statement, had discussed the sighting with the officer in charge of the patrol and several other patrol members. Although his account may be somewhat exaggerated, it was generally confirmed by the other members of the patrol, and the source appeared to be sincere and trying to report the incident as accurately as possible.

III. TIME AND PLACE OF OBSERVATION: At about 0230-0300 Sunday morning, 3 November 1957, in the vicinity of White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico.

IV. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT(S): The object, or objects, were described as being "saucer-like" in appearance and approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. They were silvery in color and seemed to be glowing with an internal light. Two of the objects were observed, traveling in tandem, at an estimated altitude of 500 to 1000 feet, and at a speed estimated to be 3 to 500 mph. They were observed for a period of about 2 to 3 minutes, after which they accelerated and disappeared from sight.

V. FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS: The objects were observed to make abrupt changes in direction, stop and hover, and accelerate at extremely high speeds, all within a matter of seconds. During the observation, one of the objects appeared to extend a "protrusion" or "appendage" from its underside.

VI. COMMENTS: The source stated that the objects were totally silent in flight and unlike anything he had ever seen before. He was quite concerned and upset by the incident, and stated that he wanted to report it, since he felt it was of extreme importance. He stated that several other members of the patrol had also observed the objects and were equally amazed and concerned. The source was very cooperative and gave a rather detailed account of the incident.

II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: Both sources interviewed by press and military personnel. The information furnished has been checked by military investigators and it is considered to be reliable. Both sources impressed the interviewer as being very observant and competent witnesses. The general credibility of both sources is rated as excellent. Their statements appear to be entirely consistent and there is no evidence of any contradiction or discrepancy in their accounts. The setting for the sighting has been verified out of all proportion to its importance.

III. SIGHTING DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At approximately 0.36 on Nov 27, the two (2) witnesses were on routine motor patrol in the general area of the West Impact area. The night was clear and the moon was bright, and there was little or no ground haze or ground fog. Their attention was attracted by a strange light in the sky about 10 degrees above the horizon, approximately 10 to 15 miles distant. This light appeared as two (2) bright stars at first, but as they watched, it gradually separated into two (2) distinct and separate objects which were manuvering silently and rapidly through the sky, sometimes disappearing behind scattered clouds. The moon was visible at the time, and was the ONLY source of illumination, other than this strange phenomenon. At no time did it appear to be any brighter than Venus would appear at night. The objects did not follow any set pattern or course, but appeared to be manuevering at random. On some occasions, they appeared to stop momentarily, then accelerate at a terrific speed, disappearing from sight. There was no exhaust or trail of any kind visible, nor was there any sound detected. The objects did not have a definite outline, but appeared blurred at the edges, as though surrounded by a halo or some kind of luminescence.

Sioned and sworn statement of SP-3 Henry R. Darlow to his Commanding Officer at

"On the four (4) to twelve (12) patrol, 3rd Nov 57, SP-3 DARLOW and I, SP-3 OAKES, were on routine motor patrol in the general area of the West Impact area, and saw a bright light leave the ground at an extreme high rate of speed, and disappear at a tremendous rate of speed. The light gave off no exhaust or trail of any kind, and appeared to be approximately 10 to 15 miles distant. I was reminded of the old Buck Rogers stories which I had read as a youth, and quite frankly, I was rather amazed at what we had just witnessed. SP-3 DARLOW and I discussed the matter, and decided that it would be best to report the incident to the authorities."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
CASE NO. ATIC- 19257-57-3-G
DATE: 7 NOV 1957
I. IDENTIFICATION
NAME: Capt. Frank H. Forst A.F. 11-207-660
ADDRESS: 1605 S. Highland, Roswell, Colorado
OCCUPATION: Retired Military Officer
II. RELIABILITY OF WITNESS
Capt. Forst is a retired Air Force officer with an excellent reputation for truthfulness and reliability. He observed the object in question under favorable conditions and was able to give a detailed and accurate description of what he saw. In view of his background and experience, it is believed that his report is entirely reliable and accurate.
III. DETAILS OF OBSERVATION
At about 0630 hours on 7 November 1957, Capt. Forst observed a strange luminous object hovering over the White Sands Proving Ground near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The object was disc-shaped, approximately 50 feet in diameter, and was giving off a greenish-white glow. It was hovering motionless at an estimated altitude of about 1000 feet, and remained in this position for approximately 5 minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight.
(additional details about the object's appearance, maneuver, and disappearance are provided in the report)
IV. CONCLUSION
Based on the detailed and reliable information provided by Capt. Forst, it is the conclusion of this report that the object observed was an unidentified flying object of unknown origin and nature. Its performance characteristics were far beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft, either military or civilian. The report is considered to be of considerable intelligence value, and it is recommended that further investigation be conducted.

UFO SIGHTING, WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUNDS, NEW MEXICO 
7 NOVEMBER 1957

RELIABILITY OF OBSERVER: Highly reliable. He was immediately dressed in his Army uniform and responded to the Call Station. He was cooperative, and was able to describe the sighting.

The object appeared to be round, metallic-appearing, and was estimated to be about 30-40 feet in diameter. It had no visible fins, ports, or projections. It was flying at an estimated altitude of 2,000-3,000 feet, and moving at a very high rate of speed estimated to be between seventy-five and ninety (75-90) miles per hour. The air temperature was cold, drizzing, and windy, and sources stated no stars were visible. After the sighting, the object headed north and was lost to sight.

AT ABOUT 0230-0300 SUNDAY MORNING, 1 CPT. K and PFC Y were on patrol in Sealed Area, when they noticed a very bright object high in the sky. As they proceeded north toward South Gate, and object kept coming straight toward them. The object stopped and hovered over them. It was extremely bright. After a few seconds, it moved away at a very high rate of speed and was lost to sight.

PFC. Y was not available for interview since he was on a three (3) day pass.

The text of the document is as follows:

"As approximately 2300, 5 November 1957, two security guards at the White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico, driving about 2 1/2 miles east of the Control Tower, saw a star-like object about 6230 the 3 Nov 57 between 2330 and 2340. It descended to about 100 feet and then suddenly accelerated again until it was out of sight within a few seconds. The object was estimated as about 20 feet in diameter. It came down slowly, hovered, and then went out fast. There was no sound and it was about 310 feet in diameter. Security guards reported seeing the object several times and then it would disappear behind clouds. Security guards at the White Sands Proving Grounds saw this object at approximately 2300, 5 November 1957. The object was described as a star-like object that descended to about 100 feet and then suddenly accelerated and went out of sight within a few seconds. It was estimated to be about 20 feet in diameter.

SUMMARY:
On or about 2000 hours 3 November 1957, a light was observed near the planet Venus, which was described as unusually bright, approximately 1/4 to 1/3 the size of the planet. The object was bright enough to cast shadows on the ground. After being observed for about 2 minutes, it suddenly disappeared.
Weather records reveal that the planet Venus was at first magnitude at that time, with an altitude of 25 degrees.
On 3 November 1957, Venus was at an altitude of 270 degrees.
The conclusion is that the first patrol probably saw a UFO that the second patrol probably witnessed the planet Venus.
The sighting was made by lonely and isolated personnel on duty in remote areas.
