The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with text describing an atmospheric phenomenon.

The text reads:

different colors were caused by the prismatic effect of the earth's atmosphere. The above phenomenon was described by Dr. Heinrick, Chairman of the University of Florida's astronomy department, as irregular atmospheric dispersion.
