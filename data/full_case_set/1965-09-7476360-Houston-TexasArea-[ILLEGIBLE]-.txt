26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words the object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object you observed. 
The document then has handwritten responses which describe the observed UFO object or objects.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten diagram and text. The diagram appears to be a sketch or drawing depicting the motion and path of an unidentified object in the sky, with directions and compass points labeled. The text accompanying the diagram provides instructions and questions related to observing and recording the object's movement.

27. In the following sketch, imagine you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Show how the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" and "B" on the start and end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.

OCR output:
34. Date you completed this questionnaire:	30	DEC	1965
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points
of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your lighting:

The object was at about 30 degrees elevation at about 45 degrees azimuth and it was about 300 feet
away. It seemed to be about 10 feet in diameter and to be colored a very bright blue-white. There
were no protrusions, portholes or other visible features except that it seemed to be giving off a
great deal of light (so much so that it was hard to look at). It was emitting a deep humming sound.
It hovered for about 30 minutes, then without warning suddenly accelerated rapidly and simply
disappeared. It left no vapor trail or sound of any kind as it accelerated - it was like it had
just blacked out. They appeared to be shaking with fright while watching it. By the time we
got to a car to drive towards it, it was gone. We stood there at that point for some time more,
watching for it to return, but it did not. My daughter and I were the only two who saw it. We are
still not sure to this day what it could have been. I would be willing to cooperate further if
any additional information is needed. My telephone number is [ILLEGIBLE].

1. In forwarding the report received in the Houston area since the second half of November 1965, I do not section any unusual activity, based on previous experience. UFO activity has slowed down considerably and I therefore hold nothing back for possible future interest in such area.

2. Unless you consider that any very unusual report will forward any such cases immediately after completion of local investigation.
