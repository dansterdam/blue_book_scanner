The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and a series of instructions. The diagram appears to be a compass rose with angular markings, suggesting it may be used for plotting the position and trajectory of an object observed in the sky. There are also instructions for the observer to follow in order to record the relevant details about the object, such as its angular elevation above the horizon and the direction it was traveling.

Text from the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
