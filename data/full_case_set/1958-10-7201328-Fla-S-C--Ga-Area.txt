MEMORANDUM TO UNO-CTN FILES
31 October 1958
Subj: Unidentified Flying Object, reporting of

The object was observed by Mr. John J. and various other witnesses apparently reliable. 

The object was first sighted about 30 degrees above the horizon traveling downwards at great speed. The object appeared to be a basketball, circular, blue-green in color, and had a blue streak "tail" estimated to be 30 feet long. The observer stated that the object appeared to be uniform in color and size, and seemed to be slowing down at the end of the sighting. The observation of the object was maintained only momentarily.

The observer stated he moved forward in an attempt to follow the object to the stern of the vessel when the object disappeared behind some nearby observers. The object was visible for no more than 2 miles range approximately.

Several other witnesses noted a multi-engine U.S. Air Force aircraft circling the vicinity of the sighting for about ten minutes after the observation.

The weather was clear and sunny. The date of the reported sighting, 28 October 1958, was clear and the object was very bright, although the observer thought it was nearer and smaller than the actual object.

Mr. G. also reported that he and his wife had sighted the "missile" party approximately while driving his automobile on a local highway. (This "missile" party is thought to be usual reactions to re-entering.)

The observer, Mr. J., was employed as a leadingman shipfitter at the U.S. Naval Shipyard, Charleston, S.C., and was considered a reliable and responsible observer. There is no further evidence concerning this sighting in the event it is made public information.

There appears to be no further evidence concerning this sighting of an unidentified flying object.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
Charleston Air Force Base, S. C.
28 October 1958
On the evening of 28 October 1958, 2350 hours, an unidentified light was observed about 15 miles SE of Charleston Air Force Base. This object, falling quite rapidly from the sky, east of Charleston Air Force Base. These lights were different in that it showed no tail and no exhaust, as is normally associated with a meteor. The object descended to an altitude of approximately 800 to 1,000 feet, hovered over Runway 33, when they first observed what appeared to be a white ball of fire or a bright light of a few seconds duration. Then the object quickly accelerated and disappeared to the northeast at a tremendous rate of speed.

The object was observed on an approximate azimuth of 105 degrees and approximate angle of 30 degrees. No sound was heard and no trail or exhaust was observed. The duration of the sighting was approximately 2 to 3 minutes, no visual aids were used and the aircraft were observed in area at time of sighting.

A check with the following organizations revealed the following information: 
Operations: 1648th ATD Operations, Pope Operations, CAT Section, 363rd TW - Aircraft were airborne in local area, exact operations unknown. No air-to-air missiles fired, no air-to-air gun firing and no aircraft disappeared.

DEFENSE WARNING DIV, CHARLESTON AF STATION: No radar contacts or information regarding this sighting.
