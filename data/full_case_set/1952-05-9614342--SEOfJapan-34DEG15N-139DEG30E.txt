JAPAN
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Unidentified Flying Object
Ohshima area, Hokariu, Japan
7 June 1952
SUMMARY: On 30 May 1952, at about 1300 hours local time, a pilot and co-pilot, members of the 61st Troop Carrier Squadron, Hickam AFB, T.H., observed an unidentified aerial object near the island of Ohshima, Japan, approximately 34 degrees 15 minutes N and 139 degrees 30 minutes E.
DETAILS: The pilot and co-pilot, while en route from Tachikawa, Japan to Hachijojima, observed a bright metallic-like object that was round in shape and motionless at an altitude estimated between 19,000 and 20,000 feet. The object was observed between 1900 and 1930 hours that date.
The co-pilot and engineer, observing object from five to seven minutes, agree that object disappeared rapidly to the west, that no exhaust flames were visible, no means of propulsion ascertainable, and that object was unfamiliar and dissimilar to any known to them.
The three observers estimate the object was at approx 10,000 to 20,000 feet altitude.
Co-pilot and engineer agree that object was not a cloud, nor a balloon; agree on all points.
Pilot minimizes entire incident, stating that in his opinion object was merely an unusual-appearing dark, round and glowing object observed from other cloud formations in area and that, therefore, no identification action was taken.
Pilot, 1st Lt. Arlande, 27 yrs. of age, has 1,929 flying hrs., states he frequently encounters similar cloud formations and is not easily impressed or unduly excited by reports concerning unidentified flying objects. (Intel. Officer's opinion that pilot unduly critical and for not having taken prompt reporting action upon returning to base.)
Intel Officer believes report significant since the two crew members who observed object impressive length of time conversed object not cloud nor balloon.

The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It does not contain any photographs, but rather presents textual information about various weather balloon sightings in the Japan-Korea area.

The text in the document is as follows:

"1. On 30 May 1952, the winds in the area mentioned were all definitely from a South-Southeast direction. No wind shifts were noted. A number of pilots reports in this area were received, but no definite identification of the objects remained in doubt.

2. Weather personnel of the 21st Air Weather Wing are of the opinion that the basic cause of the sightings is the unidentified balloons, probably due to the basic height and density increases and decreases during the day. This was a contributing factor to the inconsistency of the closed object by day. The positions of these "balloons" was correctly estimated.

3. The apparent rate of travel was probably due to shifting night conditions and may be attributed to a number of factors such as: a. Number of "targets" in the area. b. Resolution and detection capabilities of radar and visual instruments. An accurate determination of the actual speeds of the unidentified objects is considered impossible with the data available.

4. The following information has been received from the 21st Air Weather Wing: a. Balloon-types: ... (detailed balloon specifications follow) ... c. Times of release: ... (detailed balloon release schedules follow)

5. The attached map gives location and type of weather stations in the Japan-Korea areas.

TEXT OUTPUT:

STATEMENT

On 29th of May 1952, climbing to 2,500 feet, airborne to search for enemy aircraft, I noticed a strange object in the sky at about 4 o'clock.

At what was finally the aircraft, and closed up out of the left west to the west, where I could see and returned up to 7,300 feet. The object was rapidly reached: to about 15,900 feet.

Since I was satisfied that it was only another cloud formation, I did not deem it necessary to contact a GOI Control Unit. I united myself with flying.

"I have enclosed a sketch of phenomena observed."

"I hereby certify that I have made the above statements, which I have read for accuracy. In the 51st Troop Carrier Group Intelligence Office, APC 704, this 7th day of June 1952."

STATEMENT

SUBJECT: AIRCRAFT #42-72372 (A) ON 30 MAY 1952 AT APPROXIMATELY 1930 HOURS ON A COURSE OF 110 DEGREES OVER VICINITY OF WEST OF HOEI, KOREA.

"The co-pilot, Captain Test, first sighted, and called to the attention of the pilot a bright white light, which appeared to be a smooth object as three times the size of a pilot light at about 10,000 feet. It was estimated to be about 30 or 40 miles away. Its position was in the center of a saudle-back mountain formation and was reported by Base Operations to be over the coast at that time. We continued to observe the object for about seven minutes which was apparently hovering. Upon reaching Okinawa we changed our course to 270 degrees, and it finally disappeared in less than a minute."

"It is appeared to me on a round shape with a short tail as the only break in the outline which was clear in definition."

I, T/Sgt. Andrew J. Ross, hereby affirm that I make the above statement with regard to my recollections and observations on the 4th day of June 1952.

STATEMENT

"At 1835, 3D May 1952, we took off from Tachikawe Air Base on a Troop Carrier flight on course 150 degrees to climb on course 250 degrees to 30,000 ft. We climbed on course and after reaching about 30,000 ft we sighted an object, which appeared to be a rate of about 130 degrees per second, traveling NE to SW, at a rate of about 3 to 500 knots."

"From time to time after take-off and after climbing a few minutes I glanced toward the west observing the effect of the sunlight on the cloud formations. Suddenly I noticed a flash of light which appeared to be a reflection from a metallic object proceeding at an extremely rapid rate, climbing or descending rapidly from the clouds. After watching this for about one minute, I noted that my watch read 1242." 

"It cannot be determined whether it was a rocket or a helicopter as I did not see the object clearly enough to differentiate."

"The action indicated to the commander, the engineer and navigater, who was not on the rear but was in the navigator's comportment, to the object. They also observed it but only once at the object. The engineer looked & he could not identify the object and said that it was not a cloud. The object was small and gave the impression of being metallic, but it vanished from sight immediately."

"It disappeared from sight at 1242. It appeared on the horizon and grew rapidly in size until it suddenly disappeared from view. The action was perfectly motionless from the time I first saw it at 1207 hours until 1242, when it moved very rapidly and was out of sight at 1244."

"It gained in size on my range of vision and traveled in an easterly direction on a heading & straight line and horizontally. I watched it until it became a mere speck and disappeared from view."

"I noticed another G-54 during the time I was watching the object. It was an aircraft at a position slightly to the NW of the object, doing a holding pattern, and appeared to be the horizon of our aircraft. The sky to the west was pink and the sun was not glaring. I did not observe any flame or vapor trails around the object at any time. I am positive that the object was not a searchlight, cloud or any other atmospheric phenomena. It did not seem to be made up off the usual type of airplane or helicopter."

"I can only guess at the attitude and distance of the object. I estimate it was about 25-30 miles west of my position and at an attitude of 10,000-15,000 feet altitude."
