Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

NARRATIVE SUMMARY:
In complying with your request for reports on the mysterious object observed
in the skies over Roanoke, Va., and other sections of this State., about eight o'clock
P.M., on May 12th 1949.

I was sitting on the porch at my home and saw the light of this object appear
from the east at about 4000 ft high, I first thought it a star but looked too large
for that for a while it seemed to be standing still., In two or three minutes I
could tell it was slowly moving., I watched it closely and the nearer it came to
me it appeared and looked like an air plane with tho landing lights on a rather
amber color., and about time it was well entering the Roanoke City limits the
lights wore out off and I did not see any other lights about it.

After the lights were cut off it came nearer and I could tell the motor or
motors which sounded very much like the drone of the B 29 motors when just cruising
along with the motors out way back and I could hear plain enough that one motor was
not running proper it sounded like it was about half way missing, and as far as
being able to see the object it was too dark., There are reports from other sections
that it was seen after passing over Roanoke., My idea about this object is it must
have been a air Ship of some size having some motor trouble and the sparks that
were seen trailing it were coming from the exhaust port.

In order to identify my self I am a Postal Employee at the Roanoke, Va.,
Post Office and have been employed there for nearly Twenty Eight Years.

SYNOPSIS
Investigation revealed an unknown OBJECT was sighted by numerous indi-
viduals during period 1920 hours to 1930 hours, 12 May 1949, in vicinity
of Christiansburg and Roano;e, Virginia. OBJECT was seen at sunset in
form of a red-yellow glow in shape of a long, narrow, oblong streak
moving upward from a position 40 to 50 degrees above a horizontal line

thumb at arms length but the speed and height could not be accurately
determined. Official weather stations reported unusual data, with
winds aloft light and variable, ceiling scattered and visibility twenty-
five (25) miles. Air activity at time of sightin: requested from offi-
cial sources reported two (2) aircraft flying in area, a weather balloon
released for winds aloft reports ani scheduled field maneuvers at wood-
rum ™ield, Roano;e, Virginia. OBJECT was not known to have had contact

The document contains two photographs:

1. The first photograph shows a street view of a village with a line of buildings on one side. The architectural style appears to be traditional, possibly in the UK, based on the appearance of the buildings and the visible chimneys. There is no significant vehicle or pedestrian activity visible in the image.

2. The second photograph shows a relatively featureless landscape with a series of small bumps or mounds, which may be hills or formations in the distance. The image is somewhat grainy, and there is no clear indication of the scale or location of this landscape.

Here is the text from the document:

---

VILLAGE OF Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgog..ychw..rndrobwlllantysiliogogogoch  

FARAWAY PLACES WITH Strange Sounding Names

The lyricist in a current Hit Parade favorite confesses there are certain faraway places with strange-sounding names that he simply is burstin' to see. He goes on to mention such familiar disyllabic names as Siam and China. But the strangest sounding places of all he completely ignores and with good reason: they are the longest (above) and second longest (below) names of localities in the world and (next page) the longest reported in the U.S.

The pretty, gently curved hill (top center in the picture below) of Taumatawhakatangihangako..auau..amataeapokaiwhenuakitnatahu contains 57 letters, is the heart of New Zealand's sheep-raising country, and its name means to the herders down under, a son, a son with hereditary nasal catarrh has played his flute to his loved one. The hill is a "that-hill." In the original Maori it means, "The place where Tamatea known as Land Eater played on his flute to his loved one." The little village of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwlllantysiliogogogoch is on the Island of Anglesey, North Wales. In a splendid demonstration of democracy in action no one of its syllables is accented over the other—Nature vs. P.C. finally shown it down to 10 letters. The name gives our tongue twisters plenty of action but the Air Force personnel who pass through such names even once prove trim, there are wonderfully relaxing places like the village of A. in Sweden and Holland's admirably simple river Y. 

HILL OF Taumatawhakatangihangako..auau..amataeapokaiwhenuakitnatahu

Mysterious Cigar-Shaped
Object Observed in Skies

A cigar-shaped object with a glowing red tip in front and a trail of fire or sparks from the rear was reported over Roanoke and other parts of Western Virginia and Eastern Tennesee [sic] last night. No official source would venture a comment on the object except that police in Kingsport, Tenn., were reported to have said the "phenomenon" was a group of jet fighters at 35,000 feet.
The first Roanoke report came from J. S. Mays, 1504 Chapman Ave., S. W., who said he saw the object about 8 last night while he was driving a few miles north of Boones Mill. He and a companion, W. F. Mullins, 1101 Williamson Rd., S.W., the object pop over the horizon.
"It was going straight up when we saw it," Mays said, and was stepping on it." He said the glow in the nose of the object was "redder than an ordinary light bulb" and it was trailing a streak of sparks. "We could see nothing of the body," he added.
Mays said he and his companion watched the object for about ten minutes as it appeared over the west horizon, traveled upward and then headed east. They heard no sound.
Other similar reports came in from Kingsport, Bristol, Pulaski, Christiansburg and points east of Roanoke.
L. B. Graybeal of Christiansburg, a former Air Force pilot, reported the object came in at about 6,000 feet and that he heard a "roaring sound." There was a light in the object and a streak of sparks, he said.
Mrs. C. L. Phillps who lives on the Radford road about a mile west of Christiansburg, said she was standing in her yard with some friends when "the thing sprung up over the horizon."
"It was neither lightning, meteor or airplane," she was quoted as saying, but was "straight along the sides, but at the head and narrowed down." There was a shower of sparks from the front end, she added.
The Civil Aeronautics Administration communication center at Woodrum Field reported "a couple of calls" about the object last night but said nothing regarding it had been entered on the official log.
In Atlanta, the CAA was asking for reports on the object, but said it was "just routine." "Wherever we hear of anything like that," a spokesman explained, "we ask for reports, no matter how strange or queer it may seem."

DETAILS:

AT OSCEOLA, IOWA

1. Mr. [REDACTED] Postal Clerk; Mr. [REDACTED] Assistant
Postmaster; and Mr. [REDACTED] Assistant Cashier, all of Osceola, Iowa,
were interviewed on 22 June 1949 regarding Mr. [REDACTED]. Informants
stated that they have know [REDACTED] for ten to twenty years as a member
of the community and that he has never been involved in any serious trouble.
[REDACTED] is not known to drink to excess. Informants stated, however, that
[REDACTED] has a "peculiar" fellow and odd in many of his ways. Informants do
not believe that [REDACTED] would intentionally tell a falsehood, but because
of his age and eyesight, he might see things that do not exist, or his
judgement of things he does see may be faulty. [REDACTED] ordered by a
Water Committee to have a leak in his plumbing fixed. [REDACTED] and
raved and threatened to sue as he said he could not get a plumber to fix
the leak, and finally had the water at his place shut off. This matter
was checked into, informants stated, and it was found [REDACTED] had not
contacted a plumber to do the work for him. [REDACTED] and be-
cause he has a lawyer's certificate is of the opinion that his opinions
are correct and are not to be questioned. [REDACTED] never practiced law
to informants' knowledge. [REDACTED] eyesight is bad and it is difficult

about flying discs and claimed he knew what they were. Informants stated that
to be sincere in his statements about the discs. Informants stated that
BURNS possesses fine character, is a respected citizen of the community,
and they know nothing derogatory concerning him.

2. Mr. [REDACTED] Retired lawyer, Osceola, Iowa, was interviewed
on 22 June 1949. [REDACTED] stated that he saw the objects on 12-15 May
1949 at 2:00 P.M. Central Standard Time, when he was in a
car about one mile west of Osceola, Iowa, and was approaching Highway #34,
which runs east and east, from the north, and was about forty yards
north of Highway #34, facing south, was looking up at the sky, and saw
six to ten objects. These objects were the size of an automobile head-
lamp, and BURNS stated that he recognized the creases and metal bands
encircling the headlamps. [REDACTED] stopped his car a short distance from
the highway and watched the objects, trying to determine what they were.
The objects looked like glass, had a metal color to them, were round and
were not lighted. Mr. [REDACTED] was facing south and the objects came from
his left and sailed into the clouds in the east or left. The first ob-
ject was going due east and was high in the air; the others skimmed along
the ground and rose into the sky. The first one was in sight for fifteen
seconds and the others were in sight up to thirty seconds. [REDACTED] estimated
their speed at 15 seconds, 60 degrees. They had no sound or odor, there
were no projections, and they climbed upward and disappeared into clouds,
upon which they had no effect. The first object was about four hundred
yards from [REDACTED] and the others were about forty yards. At the time Mr.
[REDACTED] sighted the objects, there was a cloud bank in the east, altitude
indeterminable, and the sun was bright in the west with a few scattered
clouds very high. Mr. [REDACTED] stated that after watching the objects for

about one hour, he came to the conclusion that they were nothing more
than reflections of the headlamps of automobiles coming from the east
and going into the sun in the west. Mr.______believes that the sun
in the west was sending these_reflections from automobile headlamps
into the atmosphere.____stated that as the sun moved further into
the west, the reflections decreased in the angle of their rise and at
times were barely above the ground. Mr.______stated that he is a
loyal American who wants to help the Government clear up the mystery
of these flying discs, and believes that the objects which people are
reporting seeing are nothing more than reflections. Mr.____stated
that he was of the opinion that one should investigate things of which
one is not sure. To illustrate his point, he told a_____story of an in-
cident which occurred when he was a young boy.______stated that
he was coming home one misty night and in passing the cemetery thought
he saw a ghost. Had he gone on home without investigating, he stated,
he would have been sure he saw a ghost.____investigated, however,
and found that what he thought was a ghost was nothing more than a cow
with a large white spot on her back.
