CANYON FERRY, MONTANA
Sighting Report, April 6, 1964

At approximately 8:45 PM on 6 April 1964, Mr. and Mrs. James S. Musselmann of Helena, Montana, reported observing a strange object in the sky over the Canyon Ferry area near Helena, Montana.

The Musselmann's stated that they were driving along US Highway 12 approximately 7 miles west of Helena when they observed a bright light in the sky ahead of them. They said the object appeared to be at an altitude of about 2,000 feet and was moving in a southerly direction.

The object was described as round or oval in shape and appeared to be glowing with a yellow-white light. The Musselmanns said the object was silent and was not blinking or flashing. They stated it seemed to be under control and was not fluttering or wavering in its flight.

The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before it disappeared from view behind some trees. The Musselmanns were unable to determine the size of the object, but said it appeared to be larger than a standard aircraft. They reported no other unusual sightings or activity in the area.

CANYON FERRY, MONTANA - 12 APRIL 1964

ABSTRACT: On 12 April 1964 at 1230 hours, two airmen were on a routine mission in the vicinity of Canyon Ferry, Montana, when they saw two round, luminous objects hovering over a frozen lake near the shore. The objects were approximately 3-4 feet in diameter and appeared to be approximately 30 feet above the ground. The objects were observed for approximately 2-3 minutes before they shot off rapidly to the northwest, accelerating to a high rate of speed.

The airmen stopped the vehicle and got out to have a better view of the objects. They recorded their observations in a report immediately after the incident. No explanation for the objects was determined.

Project Blue Book
April 6, 1964
Canyon Ferry, Montana

On April 6, 1964, an unidentified flying object (UFO) incident was reported in the vicinity of Canyon Ferry, Montana. According to the report, several witnesses observed a bright light in the sky that appeared to descend and then ascend rapidly. The object was described as being circular in shape and emitting a pulsating glow.

The case was investigated as part of the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, a program that documented and investigated reports of UFO sightings between 1952 and 1969. The report provided in the image appears to be a page from the Project Blue Book records, containing details and information related to the Canyon Ferry, Montana incident.
