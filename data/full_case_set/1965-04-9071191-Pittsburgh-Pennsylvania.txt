The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document, specifically a letter addressed to "Mrs. [Redacted]" from an organization that seems to be related to the Air Force. The letter discusses a previous communication and provides some information about air-related incidents. The text of the letter has been transcribed below:

Dear Mrs. [Redacted],

Reference is made to your letter of 17 April 1965 concerning a UFO sighting which I understand occurred on 9 April 1965.

The Air Force receives all reports of unidentified flying objects very seriously. It maintains a special project for the investigation of such reports. All reports received are carefully evaluated in an effort to determine the nature of the sighting.

In this case, the preliminary investigation indicates the sighting was probably a weather phenomenon, possibly a meteor or other astronomical occurrence. The extensive investigation and analysis conducted on this case by the Air Force indicates the results of the air Force evaluation.

Based on this, we can assure you that this matter will be held in confidence and no public release of the information will be made.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

Reference the attached letter from Mrs G C L.
regarding an observation by her daughter in April 1965. The following is a review of this matter for eighteen years and at present have on file more than 9,200 observations of which the observer could not identify.

Mrs. J. M. L. reports hallucinations, etc. The attached brochure is self-explanatory and describes the program to date.

Since the information, regarding your daughters observation, was insufficient for an evaluation, it is requested that the attached PIC-FTD form 36 be filled out by her and returned to this office.

Sincerely,

FOR THE COMMANDER
