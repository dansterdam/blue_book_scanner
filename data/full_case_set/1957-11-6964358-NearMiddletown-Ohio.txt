TO     FROM DATE        1 Dec 57  COMMENT NO.1
A Mr. Shumar, cf. Dayton, Ohio, AMC garage, stated he saw or observed a UFO on or about 6 Dec 57 in the vicinity of Middletown, Ohio. This UFO was observed at about 11 pm and was described as follows:
The object was approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter, circular, and metallic in appearance. It was hovering about 25 to 30 feet off the ground and had a light around the perimeter that was pulsating. The object emitted a low, humming sound. After being observed for approximately 2 or 3 minutes, the object took off at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. Mr. Shumar stated that he was quite sure that this was not an aircraft, satellite, or any other known object. The object was estimated to be about 3/4 mile from his location. Mr. Shumar stated that he would be willing to appear before any investigating body and discuss this incident further. The only other witness was his wife, who corroborated his story.
