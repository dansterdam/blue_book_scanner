Mystery Satellites - Strange Space Happenings

Several official press releases deal with strange stories on between the months, leads us to numerize and advance some theories on the possible sighting of some

In SCIENCE Magazine for 22 November 1952, Robert Wartick of Virginia Tech described the Miniature Signals Institute's "Blackhawk" velocity method to measure the odd behavior of satellite. A slight excess of power was observed, indicating the satellite apparantly had ceased to act as any sort of thing is hard to believe....

However, traching of satellites at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, said Anna is another example of a satellite which required no human control to operate.

Kershner further cited an occasion where Mariner II, on its way to the Venus, lost power and blacked out, leaving the power meter to register meteori-t ́e which apparently severed some of the wires from the power supply. This object was tracked the same data as if an object had struck it and had caused a corresponding power failure. Power eventually returned, indicating the object must have corrected itself and resumed its normal course.

Still in reference to the same article in SCIENCE, it seems both Telstar Communications and Echo I, in their attempts to set up power to establish satellite relay trouble-Telstar refused to obey commands from the ground on two occasions.

The text on the page describes a sighting of a "Walsall saucer" by multiple witnesses, providing details about the object's appearance, behavior, and the police investigation that followed.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

3 August, 1963
Walsall, England

CASE: Flying saucer down - 3-8-63

Walsall saucer

The following account appeared in the Walsall Observer, a local weekly newspaper, on 9 August 1963:

"During a patrol of Walsall, three police officers observed an object projecting a beam of light downwards. The object was estimated to be about 50 feet in diameter and 30 feet high. The officers watched it for about 10 minutes before it shot off at great speed. The object was seen by several other people and was reported to the police for investigation. The Police Superintendent and three other officers attended the scene and the object was sighted again, hovering over Beechdale Road. It was described as 'saucer-shaped' and 'glowing'. After about 5 minutes, it shot off towards Stephenson Avenue, Bloxwich, and disappeared. The object was seen by Mrs. B. Bloxwich, of 43 Stephenson Square, later. She said that while she had been talking to a neighbor on the patio, the object had suddenly appeared and remained stationary for about 5 minutes before shooting off and disappearing."

From here, the report goes on to describe the police investigation, including interviews with multiple witnesses who reported seeing the object. The report concludes by noting that no physical evidence was found, but the police were unable to identify or explain the object that was observed.

London and Home Counties
This refers to a report about an unusual aerial phenomenon observed over London and surrounding counties in England.

The text describes that on the evening of August 8, 1963, a luminous object was seen by many witnesses in the sky over London and surrounding areas. The object was tracked by the radar at Heathrow Airport and the Royal Air Force. The Air Ministry was informed and they confirmed the sighting, but stated they could not provide any explanation for what was observed. The text mentions that the object was tracked for over 100 miles and was seen by numerous eyewitnesses, but provides no further details about its appearance or behavior.

Gentlemen:  
Since reading an article on you in a local newspaper, I have been thinking that I should write to you.  
There seem's to be a more and more frequent occurrence in this part of the country of sightings of lights in the sky that appear to be traveling at a tremendous speed and altitude. Some of the sightings reported to me seem most unmistakable.  
I own a radio station and my tower is just outside the city limits. On a rather clear night, I have observed what appears to be a light traveling at great speed and altitude. It appeared to change color from a steady light to one that seemed to pulsate. This occurred on several occasions; in fact, the last one was just a few weeks ago. The object observed had no sound and was only visible for a very short period of time.  
As a result of these occurrences, I am wondering if you would be interested in any information I could furnish you. If so, I would be most happy to cooperate with you in any way that I can.  

Sincerely yours,

Rowley, Aug. 4 - A huge flying meteor about 3000 feet high was reported to have lit up the sky over eastern Massachusetts shortly before midnight Friday. Police and Fire department officials in many areas, Butler said the light was visible over a wide radius and some remarked that at the highest point the object seemed to break up and pieces came tumbling down. A Georgetown use of the municipal fireworks display that evening seems to have coincided with the sighting, leading some to doubt the meteor theory.

Text extracted from the document:

Case 86, Chicago, Illinois. August 11, 1963: Three sisters say a "long, narrow, orange light" appeared about 4:30 a.m. and a special report elsewhere.

The passage this morning from the Universal News states: "The passage this morning from the Universal News states:
The passage this morning from the Universal News states: The persons who saw the light over Chicago early Sunday say they have never seen anything like it before or since, and they describe it as a long, narrow, orange light that appeared suddenly and then disappeared rapidly."

We are informed that the three witnesses, Mr. and Mrs. Clarence L. Lampe and Mrs. Robert H. Hecker, of near Mt. Prospect, Ill., outside Chicago, testified to the appearance of this light. It is stated that Professor J. Allen Hynek, of the Dearborn Observatory of Northwestern University and director of the University's Astronomical Research Institute, said he had insufficient data to determine the nature of the light. It is also stated that Lt. Col. Frank Halliday, of the U.S. Air Force, who investigated the incident for Project Blue Book, said he could find "nothing unusual" about it.

The Edinburgh Evening Dispatch reported on August 6, 1963, flying ob-
jects had been sighted over the city the previous evening. A police
constable named Robert Brown saw two bright objects in the sky, an
estimated 20,000 ft up, which appeared to be oscillating and changing
color. After watching them for about three minutes, they disappeared.
According to the article, these were not the first such sightings in the
area. A number of other witnesses also reported seeing the objects.
He added that it was silver and shiny, "like a small moon", which
flew silently and disappeared from view.

Bilston boy sees saucer
A 12-year-old Bilston boy claims he saw a flying saucer hover over Bilston town centre last night and saw four figures inside it. The boy, David Harlow, of Hinck's Street, Bilston, said that at about 10:30 p.m. yesterday he was walking home from football training when the saucer appeared, hovering over the centre of the town. He said three friends with him also saw the saucer, which was circular in shape, bright and seemed to emit rays of light. Harlow said the saucer hovered for several minutes, moving slowly up and down. Then, while the four of them watched, it shot away at terrific speed in the direction of Wolverhampton. Harlow claims he saw four figures inside the saucer, which he says was about the size of a double-decker bus. Bilston police say they have received no reports of any such sighting, and that the incident remains unidentified.

LOCAL FAMILY SEES MYSTERY LIGHTS IN SOUTH PART OF CITY

Five local residents claimed to have observed a strange phenomenon in the sky over the south part of Centralia about 9:15 p.m. Wednesday. They said the lights would brighten and then dim and seemed to move erratically. 

The four other witnesses, in addition to the five initial observers, were members of the Bryant family. They said the lights remained visible for about 10-15 minutes.

Mrs. Bryant said she and her husband first noticed the lights while driving home from their business establishment. They could not imagine what the lights might be.

The lights were reported, in the same general area, by other residents of the south part of Centralia, Illinois. The lights seemed to hover and then move away at high speed. After they had disappeared, the lights would reappear, but it did not follow any regular pattern.

According to Mrs. Bryant, the lights appeared to be about the size of a basketball, and were a very bright white light. She said that she and her husband saw two lights Wednesday night, one of which appeared to split into three separate lights.

Transcription of the text in the document:

My 'Lights Chasing Autos'
MONDAY night, Aug. 19, in the vicinity of Montague, Mass., citizens reported seeing bright lights chasing automobiles on highway Route 2. 
Those reports were first phoned to local state police at Northampton, Mass., who said that the lights were seen by numerous people and that they were described as chasing automobiles and at times appeared to be about 2,000 to 6,000 feet high.
MONTY YOUNG, a newsman who was on patrol with the Northampton state police, said that during the week residents of that area told of seeing strange lights in the sky.
A large number of such reports came from the Centralia area, where people said they saw the lights manuever "across the sky at a tremendous rate of speed."
The lights were first noticed about 9:30 p.m. on Monday night. They were described as bright white lights that turned, flashed, and moved over the auto far Mount Vernon. He said they called his attention about 1,500 feet high.

FSIG October 1963
Mrs. FRANK BEJIN, a reporter for the Berkshire Eagle newspaper, 8/9/63 reported she and her husband saw strange flying objects over their barn or late at night. More flying saucer reports have occurred into late August and September 1963, and numerous people reported "strange lights" and "objects" moving in the sky over the North Adams-Clarksburg, Mass., area.
Lives at the north edge of town with her husband, said the strange lights startled her and she called her next-door neighbor. The neighbor said he and his wife also saw the lights and were frightened by them as they appeared to be coming towards their car. They stepped on the gas and the lights seemed to follow them as they sped towards the Centralia road. It caused the neighbor to become "slightly hysterical" and he looked continuously for the lights.
Bishop, an executive of a large insurance firm who lives in the area, said the lights appeared to be about 600 or 400 ft high, was oval-shaped and seemed about the size of a basketball, said the mayor.

The mayor said his wife was the first one to see the fireball and called it to his attention that night. He said, "It was the first she saw the lighted object as it fell and went into the Centralia area." She said it was about an inch long and she could see it very clearly. Bishop said it was an object unknown to the neighborhood.

Bishop said the fireball then moved westward, very fast, and seemed to travel in a straight line and then disappeared from sight. He said it then reappeared in the west and seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed. He said it had a white light trailing it that made a whirring sound, he said.

Mystery Lights
Trailing Cars
STRANGE lights have been seen trailing cars on highways in the Rock Springs - Parachute areas, according to the latest reports received. The lights cost some alarm among motorists who have caught glimpses of them. Reports say the lights appear to be suspended in the air but move along with the vehicle. Some motorists said the lights seem to suddenly disappear. One report said the lights appeared to be responding to the movements of the car they were following. Vernon Brinton, who lives near the Roan Cliffs, said he saw the lights several times. "The lights seem to pick up speed with the vehicle and are bright enough to light up the area inside the car," he said. Bishop, an insurance man, said the lights were oval-shaped and the size of a basketball. "They were bright and seemed to be about 400 to 600 feet high," he said.

For Curious Light
MOUNT VERNON, M (UPI)--People here were watching the sky tonight as a curious light moved slowly overhead and then disappeared behind trees.
Mrs. Mary Bishop said he saw one of the lights about 10:15 p.m. It was a large, round, bluish light, she said, and it moved slowly across the sky, hovered for a moment and then moved off behind the trees.
It is the second time such lights have been reported in the area. Last week residents of Breckenridge Center, north of here, saw similar lights a week ago. They said the lights, which were described as round and white, hovered over the car and then moved off.

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER for July 27, 1963

SATURN SHINES THROUGH NIGHT

Saturn, the ringed planet, appearing in the southeast in the evening, is at opposition this month, the best time for observing it.

By JAMES STOKLEY

THREE and possibly four planets will be visible in the night sky this month. In the evening, Saturn shines brilliantly and Jupiter also puts in an appearance, while in the morning hours, Mars and Venus may be seen. 

Saturn, which shines with a brilliance rivaling that of Sirius, the brightest star, is at opposition this month. This means that it is on the opposite side of the earth from the sun, and therefore is highest in the sky at midnight, when only brighter than any star in that part of the heavens.

Jupiter Appears

JUPITER will be brightest in the early evening. It is about 14 times as bright as the bright star Sirius, and is in the southern part of the constellation Virgo, not far from the bright star Spica, the principal star of that constellation. Together with the bright Saturn to the east, this makes a fine pair of "twin" planets to watch.

Two other constellations that are typical summetime one are visible low in the north and northwest, Lyra with its brilliant blue-white star Vega, and Cygnus, the Swan, with its bright first-magnitude star Deneb. The most famous summer constellation, Scorpius, with its bright red star Antares, is fairly low in the south.

Parent New Swiss Drug
Used for Leprosy Patients

BASEL (DPA) - The Swiss pharmaceutical firm Geigy has developed a new drug, "Dapsone", to fight leprosy. The drug is said to be a hundred times more effective than the hitherto customary preparations and also works against tuberculosis.

Dapsone has already been used successfully in the USA and in Italy for leprosy cure. In Switzerland it is to be tested for the first time in the Basel Leprosy Hospital. The drug, first used in 1954, is practically free of side effects and, unlike other drugs against leprosy, does not cause poisoning, first noticed on humans in Switzerland.

The drug called Dapsone is in Basel, Switzerland, effectively used to treat leprosy and tuberculosis. It is said to be 100 times more effective than previous preparations and has fewer side effects.

PAINTING is Britain is now a parlor game. The object is to try to get the sitter to "faint" from the tediousness of posing as a model for the painter.

In the British Medical Journal, Dr. J. T. Boughey cites cases of the "parlor game." He says that painting sittings may produce an hysterical reaction in the sitter, especially if he or she dislikes art or the artist. The strain of keeping still for long periods, the monotony, the lack of social intercourse may lead the sitter to feint, or pretend to faint, according to Dr. Boughey. He comments that he has not come across any serious after-effects from this harmless "parlor game."

Parent New Swiss Drug
Used for Leprosy Patients
BASEL (DPA) - The Swiss pharmaceutical firm Geigy has developed a new drug, "Dapsone", to fight leprosy. The drug is said to be a hundred times more effective than the hitherto customary preparations and also works against tuberculosis.
Dapsone has already been used successfully in the USA and in Italy for leprosy cure. In Switzerland it is to be tested for the first time in the Basel Leprosy Hospital. The drug, first used in 1954, is practically free of side effects and, unlike other drugs against leprosy, does not cause poisoning, first noticed on humans in Switzerland.

TWENTY MINUTES OF TERROR
by Jeanie Stivers

Creator's Note: Every year we receive dozens of personal accounts of saucer sightings or encounters. The one that follows is eminently sensible and well written. Though over 20 years old, it has never been published, and we present it with a minimum amount of editing.

I shall endeavor to describe my strange dose after listening to you on the Long John radio show. The experience I had with a flying saucer was last summer. As I related, it was the most frightening and yet the most exciting experience of my entire life.

It started when neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Middleton, invited me to spend the afternoon with them at their country place near Middletown, New York. We spent the afternoon wading in the creek and bird watching. We became so engrossed in observing the numerous birds that we lost all track of time.

About 9 p.m. we got together some blankets, canned fruit, and other supplies, and drove to a nearby hill to watch the stars. It was a clear, moonless night, and it was quite serene, with the twinkling of the stars and the darkness all around us. There was no moon, and it was quite serene, with the twinkling of the stars and the darkness all around us. 

Suddenly, I became aware of a light coming down from the sky. It was descending rapidly, and it was a bright orange-red in color. At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it was moving too slowly and was not blinking. As it got closer, it became apparent that it was not an airplane at all. It was a huge, round, glowing object. I estimate it was about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. My heart began pounding in fear when I realized what it was.

As it came closer, I could make out the details. It was perfectly round, and the glow seemed to be coming from the entire surface, not from any portholes or windows. There appeared to be a dull metallic band around the outer edge. The glow was amazingly brilliant, yet did not hurt the eyes. Suddenly the object stopped about 50 feet above the ground and just hovered there. I was petrified. My heart was pounding in sheer terror. This was the most terrifying thing of all. That it didn't make a sound was even more terrifying. Then from its center, there appeared a small orange light that began flickering. Then from its center, there appeared a small orange light that began flickering. This seemed to be some type of opening or hatch. I became so frightened I could hardly breathe.

The object just hung there motionless for what seemed an eternity. Then, without any noise or warning, a beam of light shot out from the center. It was a brilliant white-blue color and was shaped like a column. This column of light extended down to the ground, not far from where we were sitting. I clutched at my friends, too petrified to move.

The column of light remained for several minutes, and then suddenly it was gone. The object, still hovering, began moving again, this time upwards. It moved slowly at first, then picked up speed and shot upwards at an incredible rate, disappearing into the night sky. It was gone in a matter of seconds. I will never forget that strange craft and the unearthly silence that surrounded it. 

We sat there for several more minutes, too stunned to speak. Finally, someone suggested we had better get out of there. We hurriedly gathered our things and headed for the car. I shall never forget that terrifying experience with the saucer. To this day, I have been having occasional nightmares about that strange craft.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"From which it has come, and I think it
for certain that it had some connection with the
March air force base that is located in
Syracuse, N.Y.

This object that has had flown by
the police made you noise whatsoever. 
They were hovering, and it was very bright and
went north. Camp Drum, I am used to
the coming and going of the military
planes that city never where. However, since this
thing passed right over town, the police are
very frightened, and it appears that this
is not for a special purpose, and
that special purpose we are to make contact
so they 92 make contact with the U. F. O.
that is said such up with some one.

I don't to state that whatever a clear
day like this, see shining brightly, and
very strange."

What a cloud in sight
How about contacting yourself-
to see if they have anything on the

gathered the best of mine.

Landing on Wimbledon Common
From the Wandsworth Borough, London, on August 16, 1963, Mr. Bridge, a 28-year-old artist, says a police constable told him that he had seen a strange object land on Wimbledon Common, and that he would like to speak with the witness.

The constable said that the object rose from the common and then shot up and away at a terrific speed. The object was described as being disc-shaped and metallic-looking. It seemed to be about 20 feet in diameter. The witness was unable to walk for a short time after seeing the object, and described feeling numb.

The constable asked her what she was doing, and she replied that she had been painting and was just leaving when she saw the object land. She said she would be unable to paint for the rest of the day, as she felt sick and dizzy. The constable said that people who had seen the object flying over the common on the same morning had also complained of these effects.

Unfortunately, the address of the witness is not given, and she could not be located for further questioning. The police have no other information on this incident.

UNCLAS. SERIAL CONTROL NO. 15
NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE ON AERIAL PHENOMENA
WASHINGTON 5, D. C.
AUGUST 20TH, 1963
The reports included here in Madras, had a great deal of information in them. A very impressive group of reports, but there are some things that require a little bit of further investigation or clarification. There are a few sightings that need a little more information or particulars but on the whole very well documented and clearly described cases. I would say that there is nothing startling or extraordinarily unusual in this group of reports, but the details, descriptions and supporting evidence are very good, especially considering the remote location and the difficulties of getting good observations and reports. The "Madras" sightings are worth study and comparison with other sightings in that general area. The reports overall are of good quality and indicate a serious effort at objective observation and reporting. A few of the reports need a little more information, but on the whole they were very good.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY) OBJECT NOT FLYING: REPORT OF AN OBJECT ON THE GROUND

Gentlemen:

I have written to the Air Force before and thought you might be interested in hearing what else I have to say.

When we first saw this thing, it was hovering just about the ground! No more than a foot or so from the ground. It just seemed to be floating there. When we first noticed it, it was about 200 to 300 yards away from us. As we walked towards it, it started to rise. It got up to about 100 to 200 feet in the air and then just took off at an unbelievable speed. I couldn't even begin to guess how fast it was going. It just disappeared.

The object itself was a little larger than a car, and was kind of a dull grey color. It had a slight dome on top, and we could see what looked like windows or ports all around the side. There was no smoke, no noise, absolutely nothing to indicate any kind of propulsion system.

We were dumbfounded at what we had seen, and to this day, I can't explain it. I wonder if you people might be able to shed some light on it. I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

The object was about 15 feet tall
It was a perfect circle
The witness described the object in detail, including that it was hovering, making no sound, and had bright lights on the side and bottom. The object then suddenly accelerated and disappeared.
The witness did not fall for the object as he was driving on the road in Waterboro, New York.
The document ends with "Thank You" and some additional handwritten notes.
