AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PLACE OF OBSERVATION: Agricultural College, Logan, Utah
DATE OF OBSERVATION: 17 October 1952
OBSERVER: Major Robert L. Howard, AD 662 755

SUMMARY: (An unidentifiable flying object was sighted by Major Robert L. Howard and 500 students approximately 10 miles south of Logan, Utah. The object was described as resembling a disk and was observed for a period of 2-3 minutes. It appeared to be in the process of a disk and to traverse a horizontal path, ascending rapidly.)

There is no photograph present in this page of the UFO report document from Project Blue Book. However, I will proceed to extract the text from the document using an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) approach:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PAGES: TWO OF TWO PAGES

1. This report of an unidentified flying object is made by Major Robert L. Cowart, Acting Intelligence Officer, Logan Field, Utah. The pilot was a USAF pilot on flying status who is 34 years of age and who has approximately 1300 hours of flight time.  

2. The object appeared to observers to be a disk (similar to a saucer-ship) emitting a greenish-white glow. The size and altitude of the planet Venus, but the exhaust was not sufficient to propel it to the high rate of speed exhibited. The object made no sound and showed no evidence of jets or propulsion mechanism.

3. Objects was observed at 0300 hours (PST), 17 October 1952, and was observed for approximately 30 minutes. The object was observed in the area of Logan, Utah.

4. Observation was made from the ground along U.S. Highway 91, approximately two miles north of Logan, Utah. The object appeared at approximately 5,000 above the horizon, north west of the observers position. The object moved in a straight line, leveling off at approximately 12,000 feet and traveling at a speed of approximately 1,200 to 1,500 feet per minute. All observations were made with the unaided eye.

5. Observer is an aviation transport company and two experienced and reliable passenger bus operators. All observers are regarded as credible and reliable.

6. At the time of observation, the weather was clear with no moon. There were no known conditions, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

7. There were no known conditions, meteorological or otherwise, which might account for the sighting.

8. No physical evidence of the sighting was obtained. There was no known attempt at interception. Location of air traffic in the area is unknown.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a filled-out project 10073 worksheet from Project Blue Book, which is a document containing information about an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with hand-written notes and calculations.

1) 10800 Z RAOB at LAS - velocity, trajectory, and declination of 910 MB from 940 MB to 210 MB.

2) 10800 Z RAOB at LAS - pressure, temperature, and water vapor content from 940 MB to 210 MB.

3) Base (press. at LAS) is 940 MB.

4) Above 910 MB, lapse rate is normal up to 400 MB (as per a RAOB given).

The document contains various calculations and notes, but no photographic images.
