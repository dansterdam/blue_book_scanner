February, a friend had shown him an article in the Question and Answer Section
of a magazine. FUGATE advised that the magazine is titled "Amazing Stories."
The article was based on a letter by a Mr. _________ of Phoenix,
Arizona. The article stated that Mr. ___________ had been interviewed
by two Federal agents. That he had turned over two pictures of "Flying
discs" to these agents, and that the pictures had now been returned.
Mr. ________ desired information as to how he could sue the Federal Government
for these pictures. Mr. FUGATE feels that this individual is the SUBJECT of

DETAILS

This investigation is predicated upon a Routing & Record Sheet, sub-
ject "Investigation of Flying Discs," dated 2 May 1949, signed by W. E.
CLINGEMAN, Colonel, USAF, Chief, Domestic Intelligence Division, Intelli-
gence Department, Wright-Patterson AFB.

Colonel CLINGEMAN indicates that he is in receipt of a Memorandum
written by GEORGE FUGATE, JR., Special Agent, CID-ADC-4AF, in which Mr.
Fugate who is from Phoenix, Arizona, hereinafter referred to
as SUBJECT, was interviewed as an observer of a "flying disc." SUBJECT con-
tended that he took a picture of this disc, and two positive prints of these
photos were turned over to the CIC agents. Photo experts are somewhat ago-
as to whether the photographs mentioned in SA FUGATE's report could have been
taken under the conditions he described. The experts do agree that the techni-
cal in development and printing of the pictures is extremely crude.

Colonel CLINGEMAN requests inquiry to investigate the standing of
the thus described to know the type and amount of business conducted by the or-
ganization on end with whom and the social and professional status of SUBJECT.

Colonel CLINGEMAN states that later correspondence from the SUBJECT
implies that he is connected with the Administrator and Observa-
tory in Phoenix, Arizona and refers to himself variously as Chief of Staff
and President of that organization. He also uses the title "Doctor." Accord-
ing to his letterhead, one of the specialties of 

AT DAYTON, OHIO

2. On 16 May 1949 at the Headquarters 5th District OSI (IG), the Writer
interviewed Special Agent GEORGE FUGATE, JR., previously mentioned in this re-
port, formerly a member of the Counter Intelligence Corps, Air Defense Command,
4th Air Force.

Mr. FUGATE said that the interviewer resulting in the Memorandum pre-
viously mentioned was a bit hazy in his mind. FUGATE said that he had been
instructed to interview SUBJECT in the company of Special Agent BROWER of
the OSI Office, Phoenix, Arizona.

Mr. FUGATE states that the thing he remembers most is the fact he
saw a large quantity of expensive looking radio equipment in SUBJECT's home.
This did not seem to be in keeping with SUBJECT's station in life.

The image features two black and white elongated blurry shapes that might resemble some sort of flying objects or anomalies. They are not clear photographs and seem to be of a very low resolution or quality, which could be due to rapid movement, distance, or other factors that make it hard to discern any detail of the objects in the photographs.

and they resembled dense cumulus. A 15-20 mile per hour wind was blowing.
At approximately 5 or 6 on this date, the observer, while working in the garden,
the noise stop and he hear a noise resembling a -20 aircraft, apparently com-
ing in a westerly direction. Upon visualizing, he observed to the north-
east what appeared to be an oval shaped object. He described this body as being
possibly 30 to 40 feet in diameter, revolving at an estimated speed of 100 miles
per hour. It appeared to be made of material in a small radius of possibly one-
half to three-quarters of a mile, suddenly vacated the surroundings. He later heard
the noise once more about 1½ to 2 miles to the south east and above him. A search
was made, and this time a completely round object, also of metallic grey, was seen,
which is as large as the diameter one would see if you stuck a dime on a board 3½ feet
from one. This shiny object on the second turn, it was in a northwesterly direc-
tion from its place of the again snapped a photograph, which more closely re-

He further described the downward curl of the ship by stating that instead of
completing the leftward downward spiral a wing vaulted to the right and dis-
appeared into the clouds. It stated that just as it "vanished, he had snapped
the second photograph,

of approximately 450 to 500' between 1,500 and 2,000 feet altitude, Mr. Rhodes
described the appearance of this ship as closely resembling a picture illustrated
appeared on the front cover of the July 7, issue of the mechanics illustrated
magazine, only differences noted were, shape of the thing appeared
to be flying backward.

Mr. Rhodes also related that he did not associate the appearance
of this ship with the numerous reports of "flying discs," He stated, however,
that after a friend whose instructor was engaged as reporters to write a scrap-
appeared in the local papers was "blown up" to the extent that he, thereby
received $300 information furnished by him. Mr. explained that the
aforementioned dimensions and distances were only estimated, pointing out that
his previous experience probably assisted him in making fairly close estimates.
He related that he had been doing experimental work for the past ten years.
He also stated he was employed at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory, Washington,
D.C. during the early part of World War II and left there the beginning of
1942. Upon his return to Phoenix, he was employed at Falcon Field near Phoenix
which was leased by the British Government for training purposes. He instruc-
ted in instrument training, aircraft identification and gunnery practice. He
and finds that his hobbies are to do with science, physics, radio, electronics
and astronomy. He produces movies which he made of a radio controlled
airplane. He related that most of his work consists of building transformers
but it is also necessary for him to depend upon his musical ability for his
livelihood.

In explaining his results of photographing the object Mr.
stated he was surprised that the object appeared dark on a light back-

                Memorandum for the Officer in Charge
Investigation of "Flying 
Discs"
2 September 1947

On 29 August 1947 in the presence of S/A Brewer (FBI Office, Phoenix,
Arizona) ------------ was interviewed at his residence at 
                                    Phoenix, Arizona, in connection with investigation 
of "Flying Discs". Mr. Rhoads stated that on the afternoon of 7 July
1947 immediately following a local thunderstorm, at about 1:00 while he
was walking from his home to his workshop (located approximately 100ft.
directly back of the house) when he heard a noise in the east which sounded
to him very much like the approach of a jet airplane, possibly a P-80. He
stopped and looked to the east but saw nothing for several seconds. A few
seconds later, however, an object appeared from the north-east. This object
seemed elliptical in shape with a diameter of 20-30ft. At first sight, it 
appeared to be at about 5000ft., traveling about 400 f.t.o.m.p. Its color
was gray, which made it blend into the clouds and difficult to see at a dis-
tance. As soon as it appeared in the north-east, he observed it and it
turned heading a level of about 2000ft., more or less, and spiraled down-
ward, spiraled upward into the west at an angle of 30 degrees, disappearing
into the cumulus clouds which appeared to be at about 5000ft. at that time.
The object was visible from the time of its appearance in the north-east to
its disappearance into the west about 60 seconds. In spite of the fact that
a noise was heard prior to the appearance of the object, while in view, it
produced no audible sound. The tail of the object had two points on the out-
side as well, visible as it made its two left-to-right circles, which had an 
approximate radius of 1/4 to 1/2 miles. The object had what looked like a
steel rod down its power underneath running both back and under the object.
The capability of the object from the sound was well over 600 m.p.h. with 
the na[n]ked eye. The object was not revolving on its own axis. It had no
discernible landing gears or propellers, It appeared to have an excellent
air foil (tapered from wing tip to object tip). It was stated that it is
possible that he did not hear the wing whip while in sight because of 
the rustling of tree leaves set up by a wind velocity of 10-15MPH. He also
stated that the first sight of the object resembled him to think it might be
the Navy's new Flapjack plane illustrated on the cover of the May 1947 issue
of Mechanics Illustrated. He later altered his opinion because this object
appeared to have nothing gears and no propellers, and the Navy ship is 
illustrated as having both. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
said that immediately after the object
had started into its first spiral he ran to get his camera, which he kept
loaded and set at all times for the purpose of taking candid action shots of
his family and which he kept right inside the door of the workshop. By the
time he returned with it, the object had completed one circle and had started
on its second. At this same time he called to his wife who was in the house,
but by the time she arrived in the back yard the object had disappeared.
------------- stated that he was made to take one photograph of the object while it
was at its lowest point (about 2000ft.) and another just as it came out of its second spiral ascent. (Exhibit 1) (Exhibit II). The second
photograph he states, depicts clouds, etc., made the disc invisible.

Report of Trip to Holloman Air Force Base, 5 - 6 May 1948

1. The primary purpose of this trip was to interview Dr. [redacted], representing the Watson Laboratories, who was temporarily on loan to Holloman Air Force Base. Upon arrival, it was learned that Dr. [redacted] had returned to the Watson Laboratories at Red Bank, N.J. A biologist from Holloman Air Force Base stating that Dr. [redacted] would not be available for interview did not reach Eg, A/C in sufficient time to postpone this visit. However, it was learned that Dr. [redacted] would be at Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, Ala. on or about 11 May 1948 for an indefinite period of time.

2. A civilian, Mr. [redacted] who works in the same laboratory with Dr. [redacted] had also seen the unidentified flying object while in the presence of Dr. [redacted]. Mr. [redacted] was interviewed with the following stated results:

a. The object definitely was not a balloon.

b. The object appeared round and tower[TEXT OBSCURED BY REDACTION] at a high rate of speed.

3. Mr. [redacted] promised to send in a detailed report through channels, together with the report of another civilian who also witnessed the phenomenon.

4. It was also learned that a Lt. [redacted] who works in the Radar Laboratory at Holloman AF Base Hqs, on several occasions in the past, witnessed high scope unidentified flying objects at high altitude moving at a very high rate of speed. Lt [redacted] was not available for interview; however, a request for a detailed report of these observations was forwarded to the Commanding Officer, Holloman Air Force Base.

5. Lt. Colonel James C. Jensen and Mr. Alfred C. Loedding proceeded to Fronter, Ariz. to interview Dr. [redacted] and follow up on the reports and photographs made on 24 April 1948 near the Atomic Energy Commission's Gila Laboratory. Dr. [redacted] who admitted his primary interest is in a small quiet field—paleo[TEXT OBSCURED BY REDACTION] his business card, this laboratory is called [redaction]. According to Mr. [redacted] appeared to be particularly sincere and apparently is quite interested in scientific explorations. Mr. [redacted] stated he was an aircraft recognition instructor during the last war, and that in his opinion, the object sighted definitely was not a wind-blown object. He reiterated that the object was not less than 2000 ft. away and that it was much more than 2000 ft. away when it had greatly increased its speed, the crackling electrical effect having also started when he took the photographs of the flying object and it landed. The smooth paths of approach and departure on the radar scope indicated an exceptionally steep angle of ascent and descent. Mr. [redacted] promised the object turned directly away from him, not as an aircraft turning on a line of flight, but almost as if the object were indicating "war maneuvers" by some another more detailed report is being made concerning this observation.

Object appeared elliptical in shape and had a diameter of 20-30 feet. When
first seen it was at about 5,000 ft and traveling from 400 to 600 MPH. Its grey
color rendered it difficult to perceive at a distance as it blended with the
clouds. Although a jet-like noise was heard prior to the object's appearance
no audible sound was produced while it remained in view. The tail of the object
had two points on the outside area, visible as it made its two left-to-right
circles which had an approximate radius of 1/4 to 1/2 miles. Two object had
what appeared to be a cockpit canopy in the center which extended toward the
back end beneath the object. The "cockpit" did not protrude from the surface
but was clearly visible with the naked eye. The object did not revolve on its
own axis. It had no discernible landing gears nor propellers. It appeared to
have an excellent air foil (tapered from wing tip to wing tip). Mr. ____
thought that the 10-15 MPH wind velocity which caused a rustling of tree leaves
might have made it impossible for him to hear any noise connected with the object.
He also stated that he thought the object was the Navy's new "Flapjack Plane"
but altered his opinion since the object seemed to have no landing gears and no
propellers. (The Navy ship is illustrated as having both).

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC INFORMATION

SUBJECT: (Unclassified) Declassification of Unidentified Flying
Object Photographs

1. In accordance with request contained in your memorandum
of 5 June 1952, photographs 3492J A. C. and 34927 A. C. taken by
Mr. ------ while he was in the air in the vicinity of Phoenix, Arizona in July 1947 have been re-
viewed by this office and an attempt has been made to locate, the 
original negatives.

2. The original negatives are not on file in this Directorate
nor at the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB.
If it is determined that the Photographic Records and Services
Division here does not have them, it is suggested that Mr. ----
be asked for further and definite data to facilitate trace action.
Such information should include the name and rank of the officer
to whom the negatives were submitted as well as this organisation,
location and date. All of this data should appear on the receipt
obtained by Mr. --.

3. If, upon completion of the action suggested above, it is
established that the original negatives have never been returned
to ----, it is recommended that this be done as soon as they
can be located if no current policy is to be made personal photo-
graphic negatives of unidentified flying objects only as long as
is required to analyze and duplicate them for USAF use. Such action
would automatically declassify the photographs.

4. It is also recommended that the letter accompanying the
original negatives upon their return to Mr. ----- include an emu-
phasis on apol., the negatives were requested. Such an
expression of apology not should not only return fraternity, because
statement will possibly eliminate any air of secrecy which may have
become associated with them s a result of their prolonged retention
by this USAF. In this manner, it is hoped that Mr. ----- and the
press will not accord the env unwantde attention.

5. Although the photographs would be on file in thris Head-
quarters as unclassified following the action sugge tod paragraphs

Incident No. 10 -- 7 July 1947, 1600 hours, Phoenix, Arizona.
One observer witnessed an elliptical, flat, shiny object, measuring 20-30 ft across, flying 500-600 mph, spiraling downward to 2000 ft from 3000 ft, then ascending at a 45° angle into an overcast. Observer ran into a garage where he obtained a Kodak Brownie 120 box camera, and snapped two pictures, one negative, and a print of this other, are contained in project files. The negative displays a small apparently flat object rounded on one end, and pointed on the other. The object appears to have a hole in the center. The image is in stark contrast with the background of clouds. From the print, the object appears to be jet black with sharp outlines. Four expert photographers concur in the opinion that the image is of a photographic nature, however, they disagree with each other as to the possibility of aligning such an appearance under the conditions described. Considering the object's very disorder shape, and at a distance of 2000 feet, it seems unlikely that it would appear pure black on the print. The subsequent correspondence to the reporter of this incident, the observer refuses to release as part of the data, stating that to do so would breach the confidentiality among one of his specialities. Yet, the negative was carelessly stored until fully developed. It is cut with streaks and grid over a desk or on this end, has faded very noticeably, an OSI agent discovered that a year by this observer was stimulated by Amazing Stories magazine and Wells' "War of the Worlds" by this latter he stated that he had "an interview to two radio stations," and in the interviews following the session that the pictures had not been returned. Requested the advice of the OSI and as to how to proceed to submit the document. This individual is aware of the whereabouts of those pictures, but has never requested their return. There are other undesirable aspects to this case. The observer's character and business affiliations are presently under investigation, the results of which are not yet known. Dr. Irving Langmuir studied subject photographs, and after learning of the prior passage of a thunderstorm, discounted the photographed object as being merely paper swept up by the winds.

AF Opinion: In view of the apparent character of the witness, the conclusion by Dr. Langmuir seems entirely probable.

of a golf ball either in water or show that the ball is being temporarily surrounded by approximately 1 inches and the image of the ball and ball are in coalesce. In the case of the Rowley type shutter another type of distortion is introduced due to the elongation of the slit as shown on one of the exhibits which i quite probable for the projection of the shutter aperture. This form of distortion is equally report. The camera which took this photograph being a box camera had a rotary wiping type shutter.

2. In clarification of comment in sub-paragraph b; paragraph 2, Comment N: the following explanation is given: In the photographic processes it is quite possible to increase the contrast of the finished product over the original print contrast of
the original object by increasing developing time of the negative and printing the object archive on a hard or contrasty paper. As stated in the report by Mr. that the negative being gray blended with the gray overcast clouds. It also appears that the underneath side of the aircraft or object in question not to be lighted by the sun i.e., there would in shadow would not reflect as much light - to impress it's image on the film, as would the clouds which are diffusing the light from the sun. The photographic contrast is obtained through the processing means outlined above.

1. In reference to sub-paragraph a of paragraph 2, Comment No. 2, the following explanation is given:

a. There are various types of shutters utilized in Cameras. The three (3) present types are the Between the Lens type, Focal Plane type and Rotary type. The distortion produced by the so respective shutters are indicative of the type with which the camera is equipped. - In the case of the Between the Lens type shutter, which starts opening from the center to the maximum aperture and closes in the reverse manner, the distortion would be only along the axis of travel of the object being photographed. In other words blur resulting from this type of shutter would produce no distortion along the axis natural to the direction of travel of the object. In the case of the Focal Plane shutter, for an object traveling in the same direction as the opening of the curtain, the distortion can be either that of elongation or for shortening of the image due to the traveling of the aperture with the direction of the image or against the direction of the travel of the image, the distortion becomes one of elongation. In the case of the circular and Iris type, the abnormality normally would be that of a radial distortion or by section because of the type of blade that constitutes the aperture. The aperture of those types are straight, symmetrical blades when photographed with a focal plane shutter. The blades are normally bent.

Incident #40 -- Phoenix, Arizona -- 7 July 1947

No astronomical explanation seems possible for the unusual 
object cited in this incident.

This case is especially important because of the photographic 
evidence and because of the similarity of these photographs to the 
drawings by [Redacted] (incident #17). The two incidents are sepa-
rated by slightly more than two weeks, and, of course, they occurred 
in different localities. It is, however, perhaps more than coincidence 
that these two best-attested, entirely independent cases should agree 
so closely concerning the shape of the object and its maneuverability.

The present investigator would like to suggest that this in-
cident #40, being one of the most crucial in the history of these 
objects, be reopened for investigation. The actual camera used by Mr.
[Redacted] should be examined, and the original negatives preserved. Since, 
from the size of the image on the photograph, we can have an accurate 
estimate of the angle subtended by the object, this in connection with 
what appears to be a fairly reliable estimate of the distance, can give 
us an estimate of the forces and accelerations involved in the tra-
jectory described by Mr. [Redacted] (It is unfortunate that a competent 
investigator was not dispatched at once to "reconstruct the crime" with 
Mr. [Redacted] and to obtain sketches of the trajectory, etc., before de-
tails faded from his memory). It would be important to know what

While many incidents thus eliminated, there remain thirty-two which contain some evidence tending to support one explanation. None of these thirty-two cases was the answer completely evident and there is slight possibilities that other factors than physical and psychological factors may have contributed. However, all of these phenomena is explained rationally as reviewed by Ruppelt, Chop, Fournet, the Office of Naval Intelligence Adviser, and other unnamed advisers (1947).

Major Aerie of the Arlington Hall Collection is known for the following conclusion).

(Conclusion - continued from previous page)

There are sufficient psychological explanations for the unidentified flying objects to provide plausible explanations for points not otherwise explainable. There seems in identifying individual cults chiefly from individuals to maintain a pose, distance, idea,

out of the remaining 74 incidents are treated in detail in this
report. These incidents form no pattern in regard to areas of sightings or dates or manner of performance. There are indications that these sightings were introduced by similar projects, probably well near the been escape of number of reports of been in publicity.

(Section missing here.)

Summary and Evaluations of Remaining Reports

VII. Summary of ATIC Evaluation of Remaining Reports

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix "B") exhibit a common characteristics. Two of the forty statements of the report could not have been made into witnesses not read of them.

Absent (relation to 17), Most were published without pattern throughout the United States. A few were outside the U.S. The two descriptions of appearance or performance were greatly alike. The unexplained sightings occurred at various times of day and year.

APPENDIX B

In the following section of this report, each remaining unidentified incident is considered separately. It is not important to identify any specific phenomena or observances, but each case has inherent elements which causes to be discarded. The numerical designation is merely the date of two of the incidents in the projects files.

TO MCIA FROM MCI DATE 19 Feb 43 COMMENT NO. 1

1. Reference is made to the films taken by Mr. _________ (Incident #40) which were
Forwarded for examination. The following data were derived from a study of the specimen:

2. It is concluded that the image is of true photographic nature, and is not
due to imperfections in the emulsization, or lack of development in the section in question.
The image shows too hard an edge, and the proper type of distortion due to the type of
shutter used, the speed of the object and the fixed speed of the shutter. This "trializing off" combined a good indication within in this report.

b, The report states the object was seen at approximately 2000 feet at the
time of exposure. The observer also reports being able to see clearly a canopy or enclosure. The visual quality of a reverse personal would show for this perspective, but certainly not much further as the subject had low visual contrast, being gray against
a gray sky. If we can establish the distance from camera to subject, we will have
quantity fig. The report states that a 620 camera was used, indicating several possi-
bilities, since the 620 is nomenclature for the spooling and width of the film we may
have negatives 2 1/4 x 2 3/4" and extract from the same. The subject had been ruled out,
it was not possible to establish the exact frame size samples 2 x 2 1/2 size was out and
larger size 3 1/4 x 4 1/4". If that 3 1/4" film. This 29th film, film had a small lens, it
would be 4", said using 2000 feet as the approximate subject distance and the image size
at 764/7, we have an approximate size of 44 feet as the diagonal of the object. Now if
we choose the latter value of 5" for focal length, we have an approximate value of 55'
for the diagonal. Points of measurement are indicated from X to X on Exhibit "A."

c. It should be pointed out, the need for more detail in reports is brought
out in this report. A summary would suggest the following points:

(1) Name of camera, type of film used, developer as well as time and tem-
perature, exposure time, focal length of lens and F value used.

(2) If possible, the camera should be aimed to include some ground and
horizon as this will help fix this distance from camera to subject by
imaging reference points. These reference points can be referred to
for evaluation.

TO MCIA FROM MC/CI DATE 19 Feb 43 COMMENT NO. 1

1. Reference is made to the films taken by Mr.  (Incident #40) which were
forwarded for examination. The following data were derived from a study of the specimen.

2. It is concluded that the image is of true photographic nature, and is not
due to imperfections in the emulsion, or lack of development in the section in question.
The image exhibits a "tail" indicating the proper type of distortion due to the type of
shutter used, the speed of the object, and the fixed speed of the shutter. This trail-
ing off confirms to the general information given in the report.

3. The report states the object was seen at approximately 2000 feet at the
time of exposure. The observer also reports being able to saw clearly a canopy or en-
closure. The visual out say of an average personnel would allow for this perception, but
certainly not much further as the subject had low visual contrast, bolng gray against
a gray sky. If we can establish this distance from camera to subject, we will have a
quantity for. The report states that a 620 camera was used, indicating several possi-
bilities, since the 620 is nomenclature for the spooling and width of the film we may
have negatives 2½ by 2½, 2¾ by 3½ and 2¾ by 4½. The same would be had on a new and
latest 620 roll, 2¼ x 3½, 2¼x3½. If we extrate from sn2, the 2 by 2¼ size was ruled out,
leaving us with an area of either 3½ by 2¾ the Savioar format. Again by rough calculations
would be 4², and using 2000 feet as the approximate subject distance and the image size
at 7/64"", we have an approximate size of 44 feet as the diagonal of the object. Now if
we choose the latter value of 5" for focal length, we have an approximate value of 55'
for this diagonal. Points of measurement are indicated from xx to XX on Exhibit "A".

4. It should be pointed out, the need for more detail in reports is brought
out in this report. A summary would suggest the following points:

(1) Name of camera, type of film used, developer as well as time and tem-
perature, exposure time, focal length of lens and F value used.

Analysis

Preliminary analysis of the negative and prints leads me to doubt the story told by Mr. ████████████.

Judging from the dimensions, the negative was exposed in a simple camera of the box type, which usually has a fixed focus (about 10 feet), fixed shutter speed (about 1/25 of a second) and a simple lens of the Meniscus type. Because of the above mentioned facts, it is unreasonable to assume that sharp outlines such as appears on the negative, could be secured from an object at 2,000 feet, traveling 400 to 600 mph.

Furthermore, according to the story the object (flying craft) was painted gray to blend in with the clouds. But, even if the object would be painted jet black, under the circumstances described, to obtain a contrast such as appears on the negative is also very doubtful.

On all of the prints, excepting the print marked "exhibit A", judging from the outlines, the object has a rotating motion (revolves around its center) instead of a forwarded motion, considering the version stated by Mr. ██████████.

The details are quite grainy and not clearly defined, and the object has a somewhat blurred and shadowy appearance against a uniformly light background, likely the sky or a simple backdrop. There appears to be a contrasty, dense part at the center of the object extending to the right side.

Text or markings in the image are not legible due to the quality and resolution of the image provided. If there is any text present in the document below or above the photograph, it is not visible in the image you provided. Therefore, as an OCR system, I cannot provide an output of any text from this document.

1. ITEM NO.                   2. SECURITY CLASSIFICATION                3. DATE TRANSMITTED
                              CONFIDENTIAL                              11 June 1952

Lt. E. J. Ruppelt, ATIC______Capt Fournet, AFOIN-233

Security Information. Reference TT 143 dated 10 June 52, CSAF Item No. ATIC
has no negatives of the unidentified object that were taken by Mr. __________ 
_______ in July 47. In addition, there is no information available as to whether 
or not Mr. ________ ever sent his negatives to the Air Force or whether he just 
sent prints. We do have some rather poor quality prints of this object. As 
you know, we have concluded that these photos were probably not authentic.
It seems as if Mr. ______ attempted to get on the "picture selling band wagon"
and if he can prove he sent the negatives to ATIC or to the Air Force and they
were never returned, it may lead to a touchy situation. Will you recover Mr.'s
________or do you request that we enquire? Copy requests of the prints can be
made if you so desire, however, the originals are not here.

                                                                       DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
