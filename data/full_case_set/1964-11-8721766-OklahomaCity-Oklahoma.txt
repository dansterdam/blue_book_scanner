Dear Hayden,

This is in reply to your letter of 26 December 1964. We received the Ray Stanford duplicate picture which you forwarded to Chicago, Illinois for duplication by Kodak and returned to us. The original film was sent to you previously. 1 February 1965. My analysis of the Rand Stanford film depicts an independent evaluation of the objects which appeared on the 12th. The images on the Ray Stanford film depict a different incident, glowing the intensity in an independent evaluation.

J Allen Hynek has also evaluated the movie and he has determined the image to be the same. We appreciate your forwarding this film.

Regarding the fragments which you sent us on 9 November 1964. This arrived several weeks ago. There was an amount of postage due and we did not receive this object until December. We submitted the fragments to ASD for chemical analysis and the report indicated that the particles appeared to be common to that portion of Oklahoma. A copy of the analysis is enclosed.

It appears that nothing unusual contained within the object. I would like to reiterate our thanks for your obtaining the fragments from this location. It would seem that careful observation of the sound would indicate that the impact point would be in excess of 300 miles from the point of observation.

The fact sheet is in the process of being printed. A courtesy copy will be forwarded to you upon completion. We are investigating this matter which is included as one of our case histories.

Sincerely,

We are attaching a list of the UFO organizations and hobby clubs. We would appreciate any additions or comments regarding discontinuations of those no longer active.

Please refer to the attached information regarding evaluations such as the Focus City sighting. Information regarding evaluations by the Air Force is also available to indicate status and the press. It is good this does much to clarify reports and to eliminate doubt in the minds of some researchers. This information supplied by our office regarding the Air Force investigation policy. No further information must be released through the Air Force rather than the office of the Director of PBBO.

Your six page article is being returned with a few comments by Sgt Moody. These comments are to be used for your information and/or guidance in future articles. The following comments or points appear pertinent:

(1) The Air Force accepts only essential fact regarding life and intelligence on other planets and does not engage in speculation.
(2) Information from almost 9,000 cases indicates that unidentified flying objects exist as reports of aircraft, balloons or stars, planets, but have a multitude of "natural" explanations. The nature of these other space-objects under intelligent control. The letter of 3 Sep 47 did not state that UFOs are real, but that they have sufficient information to determine if they were visitors from outer space.
(3) We would appreciate a statement of the information in your files which indicates that they are objects of interplanetary origin.

Sincerely,
Major QUINTANILLA, Jr.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Thank you for your two most recent letters in answer to my request. I hope your Christmas was a happy one.

I still have one comment to make, and will let you know as soon as I receive the copy that was made from the enclosure. Enclosed is a copy of the letter I wrote to Mr. Manley giving a lecture to the Ohio T.S. society member, and it is hoped that he will pass this information on to you.

On November 7, I sent you several fragments believed to be the rilobacterium along with that information. Did you send these fragments to Dr. Brooks for analysis? I would appreciate knowing what results, if any, came about from this.

I am looking forward to the new Fact Sheet.

Yours truly,

I appreciate the information which you have sent and you can be sure it will not be published.

I did feel that a follow up story was due on the September 1964 incident. As I told you while I was at NICAP, I felt that this matter could not be given full publicity without revealing some identifications which I had hoped to have cleared up before making them public. I do not believe they will be published in the future either.

I assure you to read the new issue of the NICAP article. I do not believe they will publish it, but I had to state our position - maybe they could have the articles as news for us.

You believes the UFO sighting is at St. Petersburg, and wrote a report about why she thought this, but have not received a reply. It must close for now.

The image appears to be a newspaper article or report describing an incident where a "meteorite" allegedly gave a city boy "once in a lifetime show". The article discusses how the meteorite supposedly hit the boy's car, creating a shower of sparks, and how the boy later found that a small piece of the meteorite had survived. The article also mentions that the boy was able to make some money by sharing his experience with others.

Meteorite Gave City Boy 
Once In A Lifetime Show
By FRANK LEE
Preliminary findings on the strange meteorite which reportedly struck a city boy in his car last Friday night, near Oklahoma City, indicate the boy may have been able to make some money out of his experience.
The strange incident involving the 17-year-old Rick Barnes: 3020 SW 41, witnessed an extremely high speed object hit his car last Friday night, around midnight.
Next he saw a shower of sparks all around and, according to Dark Johnson of the Dark Johnson Meteorological Society, Barnes had been struck by a meteorite.
Barnes, though it hit the rear of his car, did not see the meteorite. The force of the object, however, caused extensive damage to the right rear fender and rear quarter panel.
Saturday morning, Barnes was out searching the area and found what he believes to be fragments of the meteorite. He found several small pieces in the immediate area of the point of impact.
Johnson said he has analyzed the small fragments of the metallic object and finds it to be a nickel-iron meteorite. This type of meteorite is very high in nickel content and is extremely rare. The meteorite he examined was a "stony" type, meaning it had a very high nickel content.
Others are composed of silicates and other types of metallic content which gives the "stony" meteorite a different appearance.
The "stony" type, which is what Barnes found, is most likely of silficate (silicon) with other metallic content of aluminum, magnesium, etc. This type is what Johnson calls the "star dust" variety and have a meteorite a "showery" type, meaning it can break up in the atmosphere and fall in multiple fragments.
Johnson said Rick had a most unusual experience that "only happens once in a lifetime." He was able to find and keep fragments of the meteorite for his method of scientific analysis.

The field in the 4400 block near Southwest 32nd and Santa Fe, Oklahoma City, Friday night. Two boys, Dale Johnson and Steve Barnes, found the pieces of "meteoritic" material in the field where the "falling star" apparently fell to the earth in Southwest Oklahoma City Friday night. Dale Johnson, 12, said he saw the "object" fall about 9:15 p.m. Barnes, 13, said he saw the "object" about the same time. They said they found the piece* of "meteoritic" material in the field Saturday. The "falling star" was not seen by several persons from the Planetarium staff members who called to examine the material, but they indicated they had found the material had been artificially burned, as if from intense heat. Thompson, an amateur astronomer and geologist, said Sunday: Two pieces, one square and one irregular, "about the size of a fifty-cent piece," were found together in the field. He said this could be one piece that was broken into two pieces. Thompson said he planned to take a cross section of the material for examination, and that even larger chunk could have fallen.

The image contains a photograph of a strange object or entity described as "Fiery Cinders - Unique Find?". The accompanying text discusses reports of sightings of unusual objects in the sky near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and the investigation by the Air Force. However, the image does not contain any human faces or identities.

Now, acting as an OCR system, here is the text found in the document:

(Continued From Page 1) 
The group interested with an Oklahoma City police station official reported they had 'Unidentified Flying Objects' in the area. The investigation of the sightings was conducted to searchplanes near the area on which the objects were found.
FIERY CINDERS - UNIQUE FIND?   
'Fiery cindery mass'- only about the size of a softball - has attracted wide attention, but Army experts say it's really nothing to get excited about. The object is currently in possession of Olin F. Shults, of 8301 N.W. 34th Terrace, Oklahoma City, who found it on his patio last Friday night. Shults says it could be a meteorite. He says it fell from the sky about midnight last Thursday and struck his patio with a thud, shattering into several fragments.
However, Air Force experts who have examined it at the Oklahoma City Air Defense Command Radar Station say it is unlikely the object is a meteorite. It appears to be a different phenomenon, although just what it is remains a mystery.
It is an estimated 500 degree hotter than a normal house temperature, and it still has not cooled as much as expected, according to the Air Force experts. They are unable to identify it or say where it came from.
In the meantime, other witnesses reported seeing a mysterious glow in the sky Thursday night near Shults' home, and another reported seeing a flamelike object in the southwestern sky about 8 p.m. the same night. The Air Force is investigating these sightings, but has not been able to determine their exact nature.'

OKLAHOMA CITY'S RARE VISITOR FROM SPACE

Little did Rick Rume realize that before the occurrence seldom seen in such case, The main object, a search of the
literature revealed nothing alike, was merely a small blackened, triangular-shaped hunk of rock, which over 200 small fragments had broken off during its fiery descent. Preliminary analysis of the 21 pound object indicated this was basically a ferrous meteorite, the administration lab at Houston, Texas, the result of a very preliminary and cursory examination of the sample. The specimen appears to be a meteorite, the spectacular display and pyrotechnics seen by many were caused by an unusual object from outer space striking the atmosphere at high speed and partially burning up. It was merely another visitor to our planet to be added to the many which have visited here periodically since the dawn of time and will continue to do so.
Bona fide investigators have pointed out that the so-called Unidentified Flying Objects, reported by many in recent years, may well be nothing more than natural phenomena in the skies, such as meteor showers, ice formations, and mirages. There have been some cases, however, where some substance, usually in the form of unusual metal or mineral, has been recovered after the observation of such celestial visitors. In the present case there is solid evidence in the form of the rock fragment recovered.

I may add that both organic and inorganic are present. The chunk of plaster-of-Paris was partially crystalline and rather hard. The above mentioned composition does not fit any form of known crystalline minerology. The specimen will be sent to the Geological Survey for further study. In the meantime, I will continue my own research to determine the nature of this most interesting material.

I have entertained several hypotheses in regard to possible identification of the specimen. One possibility that you picked up some fragments of the former magnetic lines of force was discussed. Another remote possibility was that it represented carbonized and fused material from a meteoritic impact. Perhaps the so-called meteorites that we have periodically had on Earth have had this glass-like fragment as a component. This is so highly speculative that I place very little credence in it. Lodge melaphryes do not normally occur in Oklahoma, to my knowledge. They have been found for years on the surface of the Earth.

These fragments, like the one I have examined, give every evidence of having been subjected to a very high temperature and have been plucked off the outer surface of a meteorite after fusion crust was formed. The fusion crust is not present on these fragments. The color, texture and crystalline structure indicate that they did not originate from a high temperature fusion between the air and the entering meteorite. The fragments are more likely the result of a prior meteoritic impact which involved high temperatures and pressures, resulting in the fusion and crystallization of certain materials.

To my knowledge this is the second occurrence of mysetoidal material showing an unusual crystalline structure, partially fused interior, and exhibiting evidence of having been subjected to intense heat and pressure. The first specimens I examined were in material from the Tunguska event in Siberia back in 1908. At that time, the unusual nature of these Tunguska fragments was not recognized. They were classified simply as unidentified solid material, catalogued, and filed away. It is only recently, in the light of our present knowledge and understanding that these fragments are now recognized as probable impactites resulting from a meteoritic or cometary event.

Meteorite Cave City Boy Once Lifetimes
By FRANK LEE
Projects Manager of APRO
Proponents of the "Meteorite" 
theory regarding the UFO sightings 
of Rick Randle, 14, of Oklahoma City, 
may seem to have the possibility of 
a case, but there are several factors 
which purportedly indicate that The 
"meteorite" was probably nothing 
more than the old "swamp gas" or kin 
to that possibility. 
Just what did Rick see? According 
to his story as told by Dale Johnson, 
a teacher at his school, Rick was in 
front of his home when his attention 
was drawn to a bright object in the 
sky. The object darted here and there, 
suddenly swooping down to within 
an estimated 300 feet of the ground. 
Here it hovered briefly, then shot 
back up into the sky and was gone. 
Next he saw a shower of sparks, 
"like a Roman candle" descending 
to the ground and, according to Rick, 
the object might possibly have been the 
cause. 
Analysis of the incident: It is true 
that meteorites do on occasion pro-
duce a shower of sparks as they enter 
the earth's atmosphere, but the angle 
and behavior of the "object" as de-
scribed do not seem to fit the pat-
tern of a typical meteorite. Meteorites 
usually appear as brilliant, steady 
lights moving in a straight line across 
the sky. They seldom, if ever, hover 
or dart about. The object Rick saw is 
much more likely to have been one of 
the various "Unidentified Flying Ob-
jects" which have been sighted in 
most parts of the world, and in this 
particular area in recent years.
Johnson said Rick has described 
the object as a large, silver, disc-
shaped craft, similar to the "Pan- 
cake" Saucers. The small pieces that 
descended to the ground might have 
been the result of some sort of mal-
function or the craft dropping portions
of itself. Johnson explained that the
material of the craft is often compared
to "stainless steel, aluminum, and 
metal." Another kind consists of "a
black material that looks like plastic
or glass covered with metal." Still
another kind is a "white, glassy 
material with tiny traces of metal."
Johnson said Rick has described
the object as a "very large craft with
very high sides." The small pieces that 
descended to the ground seemed to 
make a soft, slapping sound.
So in summary, while the meteor-
ite theory cannot be ruled out com-
pletely, the preponderance of evidence 
strongly suggests that Rick saw a gen-
uine "Unidentified Flying Object" 
rather than a shower of meteorite
fragments. The craft is not equipped
with a complex analysis by this
writer.
