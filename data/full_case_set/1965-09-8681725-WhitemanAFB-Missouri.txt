(1) The preparing officer has no comments or conjecture as to what may have been the object observed, as nothing unusual was seen at his station near the runway and he did not see it nor any of the control tower personnel. Furthermore, nothing unusual was observed at the SAGE radar center, the ADIZ center, or the Whiteman AFB and that other personnel had seen them as well. Apparently no report was made in these instances.
