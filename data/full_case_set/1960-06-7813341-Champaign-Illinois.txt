1. forwarded a film strip to the U.S. Air Force which showed a UFO on several frames.

2. The film is showing a routine silhouette of a statue in the city side park in Champaign, Illinois. The filming took place at 20552 on 7 June 1960.

3. The film was analyzed by ATIC and the following concluded:
a. The object on the film is a genuine photographic image.
b. The object was a light source of considerable intensity, due to its being entirely visible within sight degrees of the sun.
c. The object was traveling at a very high velocity as evidenced by the fact that it moved through the camera's field of view in 1/4 second.
d. Image motion during exposure precludes any analysis of object configuration; however, its extremely high velocity and brilliance indicates that the object was probably a meteor or the "fireball" class.

4. No request has not given any publicity to this sighting, but it did request notification of the result of the Air Force analysis.

CASE DETAILS

Case 1	
Location: CHAMPAIGN, ILLINOIS
Date: 7 JUNE 1960
Time: 2142 hours

INVESTIGATOR'S NARRATIVE:
At 2142 hours on 7 June 1960, I was dispatched to investigate a reported unidentified flying object sighting in Champaign, Illinois. Upon arrival at the location, I interviewed the witness, who stated that while driving along Route 45, he observed a bright, disc-shaped object hovering above the treeline. The object was estimated to be approximately 30 feet in diameter and emitted a pulsating reddish-orange glow. The witness observed the object for approximately two minutes before it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.

Based on the witness' description and the lack of any corroborating evidence, I have concluded that the reported sighting can be attributed to the misidentification of a conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon. No further investigation is recommended at this time.

CASE NO. 7813341
CHAMPAIGN, ILLINOIS
7 JUNE 1960

On 7 June 1960, at approx 9:15 p.m., Mr. John Doe observed unusual lights in the sky while driving home from work near Champaign, Illinois. He stopped his car and got out to observe the lights more closely. He described seeing three bright, steady lights that appeared to be moving in a triangular formation. The lights were white in color and approximately the size of stars. They were traveling at an estimated speed of 300-500 mph and made no sound. After observing the lights for approximately 5 minutes, they suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

Mr. Doe immediately reported the sighting to the local police department. An investigation was conducted, but no other witnesses could be located and no physical evidence was found. The case was forwarded to Project Blue Book for further analysis.

The image appears to contain a report from the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center of the United States Air Force regarding a UFO sighting. The report mentions a film provided by a photographer from Champaign, Illinois, which showed a silhouette of a statue in the city's West Side Park. The film was analyzed by ATIC, who concluded that the object on the film was a genuine photographic image, but that its extremely high velocity and brightness precluded any analysis of its object configuration. The report also states that the sighting has not been given any publicity, and the film is being retained at ATIC as part of the case file.

SIGHTING REPORT

On June 7, 1960, at approximately 9:30 P.M., Mrs. Rhea Schrader, residing at 911 N. Elm St., Champaign, Illinois, reported that she had observed several UFO's in the sky over Champaign.

Mrs. Schrader stated that she first noticed a single bright light in the western sky. This light, she said, was followed shortly afterward by two more bright lights, all of which were maneuvering in a very unusual manner. 

Mrs. Schrader described the objects as being round in shape and emitting a brilliant white light. She said that the objects seemed to dart back and forth across the sky at high speeds, then would suddenly stop and hover motionless for a period of time before darting off again.

Mrs. Schrader stated that she observed the objects for approximately 30 minutes before they finally disappeared from view. She said that the objects made no noise and left no trail or exhaust visible.

This report was taken by Sgt. Frank Baumann of the Champaign Police Department. No further information is available.

1. The attached film has been analyzed and the following conclusions reached:
a. If the data accompanying the photography is true and correct, some very intense light source moved through the camera's field of view in 14 seconds. The intensity of the light source is indicated by the fact that it is entirely visible when within 8 degrees of the sun.
b. The information given regarding camera tilt is verified by the sun angle at the stated time of photography.
2. Image motion during exposure precludes any analysis of object configuration.
3. The photography and exposure data give no clue as to size, speed or distance of the object, however, the camera's field of view indicates that if the object was moving in a horizontal plane its velocity was approximately one mile per hour for the entire 14 foot of altitude above the camera station, i.e. 500 mph at 5000 feet.
4. If the photography is fake, it was probably accomplished by a double exposure in which a light source was moved across the camera's field of view at a uniform velocity.

The image contains a photograph of a silhouette shot of a statue in the center of a city owned West Side Park. The camera was mounted on a tripod and the film used was Eastman 7276 black and white film with a shutter speed of one sixtieth of a second. The exposure was F 22, using a K-2 yellow filter with the lens focused on the statue.

8 July 1960

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge your recent submission of a film strip to the Air Force which evidently showed a UFO on several frames. The sighting took place on 7 June 1960 at Champaign, Illinois.

The object on the film is a genuine photographic image. It had a luminous appearance and considerable intensity, due to its being entirely visible within eight degrees of the sun. Its high angular elevation could not be determined by the angle of the camera, but this motion precludes any analysis of object configuration. However, the high velocity and brightness indicate that the object was probably a meteor of the "fireball" class.

With your permission, the Air Force would like to retain the film strip in this case for the official file. If this is not possible please let me know and I will return the film to you immediately.

Thank you very much for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,
