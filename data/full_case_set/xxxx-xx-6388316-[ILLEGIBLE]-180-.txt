Synopsis:
Investigation requested by Colonel W. E. CLINGEMAN, Acting Chief, Intelligence Review Division, A-2, Intelligence Section, A-2, regarding an unidentified "flying disc" sighted near South Bend, Indiana. This "flying disc" was alleged to have been seen from the ground by an unknown type of plane in the vicinity of South Bend, Indiana, on or about 21:40, 28 September 1948. The object appeared to be rotating and moving at great speed. The object was in view for only a short period of time. The observations were made by an executive engineer, Body Engineering Department of Studebaker, who at that time had a clear sky over the area. The object appeared to be an unknown type of plane, made of light-colored metal, reflecting sunlight, and was traveling at a great rate of speed. The object was in view for only a short period of time, about 2 or 3 seconds. The object had been observed to maneuver erratically at a great rate of speed, and then disappeared from view.

UNCLASSIFIED

This investigation was requested by Col. R. R. GINNERMAN, Acting Chief, Intelligence Division, Headquarters, Air Force Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Branch, Wright-Field, Dayton, Ohio. The incident occurred on 13 October 1948 near South Bend, Indiana, according to information received from a source that an aerial sighting had been reported from South Bend, Indiana. Said source contained an incomplete list of investigations to be initiated, entitled "Elements" or "Essential Information".

AT SOUTH BEND, INDIANA

On 13 October 1948, Mrs. MINNIE DALY, 1205 North Olive Street, South Bend, Indiana, an Executive Engineer for Body Engineering, Studebaker Corporation, South Bend, Indiana, stated that upon this date, at approximately 4:45 A.M., she was awakened from her sleep by what she termed an aerial sighting from her office window. She stated that the aerial sighting was very close to her home, that it was silver in color, and that it appeared to be stationary in the sky. She stated further that she watched the object for about five to seven minutes, and that it then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from her sight. She said that she was alone at the time and that no other witnesses, to her knowledge, observed the object. She stated that she did not actually see this object take off, but that she assumed it did not actually leave the area, but rather disappeared. She stated further that she was frightened by the incident and that she discussed it with her associates at the Studebaker Corporation later in the day.

South Bend, Indiana, also has the aerial sightly that was reported to the Air Force on 13 October 1948, and the report indicated that the object was silver in color, stationary, and did not actually take off, but rather disappeared from sight. However, the report did not identify any specific witnesses. This report falls within the category of the "Elements" or "Essential Information" referred to in the initial request.

The Project Officer in the Production Division is Chief Engineer of the Air Materiel Command and he was briefed on the details. During an interview with the writer, the Chief Engineer stated that in his opinion, the variety of Miss DALY's sighting was not unusual, and that the Air Division of the Studebaker Corporation, South Bend, Indiana, had not noted any unusual incident on its files.

It was determined that in this case, the variety of Miss DALY's sighting was not unusual, and that the Air Division of the Studebaker Corporation, South Bend, Indiana, had not noted any unusual incident on its files.

Transcribed text from the document:

ON 3 DECEMBER 1948, MR. X, CHIEF CLERK, ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, STUDEBAKER CORPORATION, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, REPORTED TO THE CHIEF, ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, STUDEBAKER CORPORATION, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, THAT ON WEDNESDAY, 15 OCTOBER 1948, AT APPROXIMATELY 11:45 HOURS, HIS ATTENTION WAS CALLED TO THE SKY BY WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A SHOOTING STAR. HE STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE FLASHING ON AND OFF AS IT TRAVELED ACROSS THE SKY FROM WEST TO EAST. HIS ATTENTION WAS ALSO CALLED TO THE UNUSUAL APPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT. THIS OBJECT SEEMED TO BE LARGER THAN A SHOOTING STAR AND HE BELIEVED THAT IT WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. HE STATED THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME NEW TYPE OF TEST AIRCRAFT.

G. MR. SOUTH BEND, ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT, ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, STUDEBAKER CORPORATION, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, STATED THAT HE DID NOT SEE THE OBJECT AND SINCE HE HAD PASSED THE 60TH BIRTHDAY, HE DID NOT SAY ANY MORE ATTENTION TO CALIBER EMPLOYEES, AND WERE, IN HIS OPINION, TWO PERSONS THAT COULD BE REGARDED AS RELIABLE.

G. IN AN ATTEMPT TO GAIN MORE INFORMATION, THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL CHECKS WERE MADE:

A. THEY WERE NOT SURE THE OBJECT WAS ROTATING, BUT GAINED THAT IMPRESSION BECAUSE OF THE FLASHING OF THE SUN FROM ITS SURFACE.

B. THEY WERE NOT SURE OF THE OBJECT'S ALTITUDE, BUT FELT THAT IT WAS NOT TRAVELING OVER 1,000 FEET PER SECOND.

C. THE OBJECT WAS TRAVELING AT A VERY HIGH SPEED, ESTIMATED APPROXIMATELY THREE TIMES THE SPEED OF A PROPELLER-DRIVEN TRANSPORT. (DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE OBJECT COULD HAVE BEEN READILY SEEN FROM MISS...WINDOW SHOWED SHE WAS ABLE TO MAKE THIS COMPARISON.)

D. THERE WAS NO VAPOR TRAIL AND NO NOISE THAT COULD BE HEARD FROM THE OBJECT.

F. THE WRITER ASKED IF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN ESCAPED WEATHER BALLOON, AND THEY WERE BOTH POSITIVE THAT IT WAS NOT SPHERICAL, BUT LOOKED LIKE A PIPER CUB IN OUTLINE.

THEIR EMPLOYER AND HELD IMPORTANT POSITIONS WITH THE CORPORATION. THEY CONSIDERED THEM TO BE HIGH TYPE PERSONS BY REASON OF THEIR YOUTH, TRAINING, AND EXPERIENCE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THEM IN SOUTH BEND OR MISHAWAKA, INDIANA, COULD BE LEARNED.

THE UNCLASSIFIED REPORT
On December 1, 1948,
out through our office a report received from the following incident:

"At approximately 12:10 am on October 13, 1948, while looking darkness towards Clear (indecipherable) of their flying objects, bright that they could see the. The fact that they were a vehicle other than a car as they travel fast and west, or southeast. And travel about flight elevation of about 500-600 feet and (indecipherable) of vision for perhaps 15 to 20 seconds."

While I watched the object described place faded as moving toward the southwest. Whatever the object was, it was traveling at a high rate of speed and left no visible trail. However, on observing it through binoculars, I thought I saw what appeared to be a small white light near the rear which seemed to be blown off, though I cannot say definitely that this occurred. 

The object appeared to be a bright white light of the approximate size intensity of a star of the first (indecipherable) though we were able to distinguish it as a distinct and separate object from the stars. At the termination of its flight, the light appeared to dim in intensity before disappearing. Its speed was so great that it was not possible to obtain more than a fleeting observation. The movement of the object was unlike that of a meteor, airplane flare, or shooting star. And travel lasted what I estimate to be between 15 and 20 seconds.

December 1, 1948

On Wednesday, October 13, 1948 at approximately 11:35 A.M., the [REDACTED] sighted an object which we believe to be a disc or ball traveling across the sky. It was moving very fast and was traveling in a straight line but at a slight angle from the horizon. The object appeared to be silvery in color and was estimated to be 6 to 8 inches in diameter at arm's length. It was under observation for a period of 5 to 7 minutes. As the object traveled across the sky, there was no trail or vapor, and it made no sound. In fact, it seemed to move without any propelling force being observed. At intervals, the object would seem to oscillate or wobble slightly, but it maintained a steady course from northwest to southeast. Its speed was estimated to be several hundred miles per hour, but the [REDACTED] was unable to give a more definite estimate of its speed, as he had no basis of comparison. This is the first time we have ever seen anything like this.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO : Commanding General
Air Material Command
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio
ATTN: MCICO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, GIAXS-2-2, dated 9 March 1949, subject: "Unidentified Flying Objects." Your first indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incident summarizes 173 through 233 have been checked against the information which was made by the Air Force, Navy and Intelligence Bureaus. Comments based on this review are included.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigation of Unidentified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 3, "Direction of Flight" of flight of objects should be clarified so that "vertical motion" is distinguished if possible, and so that motion is qualified as to speed which should be recorded. It is difficult to secure reliable estimates of speeds of objects observed. The observation and recording of this type of data requires careful techniques and should be standardized.

T-Sgt. Frank M. Hale:
Highly recommended as to character. Ability to judge
color; O. K., ability to estimate speed & size of objects fair.

At 1711, observed object in sky. While watching a conventional plane failure
from view another object caught the attention of witness. At first the object was a pinacle or space of paper but on closer oberservstion noted that it was much higher that it would be possible to see a piece of paper. As the object became larger, the witness observed that it was silver in color and seemed to be turning or tilting. The shape could not be determined sitize the observer was certain it was not an airplane. It appeared to be traveling a direct course from northwest to southeast and was seen for periods 15 to 20 seconds.
