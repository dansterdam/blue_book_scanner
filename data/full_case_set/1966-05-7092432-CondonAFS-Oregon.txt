PRICE: 636 Radar Sq (63600) Condon AFS, Oregon 97023
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 21 May 1966
TO: Headquarters Foreign Technology Division (AFSC) (TDEW/UFU) Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433

1. Reference your letter, 7 June 66, subject same as above and attached DD Form 250, the following information and explanation is submitted:

2. The objects sighted were bright white and red lights that appeared to be about ten (10) degrees above the normal horizon in a northerly direction from Condon, Oregon. These lights appeared to be on and disappear at intervals in an irregular pattern. There was no apparent movement when viewed through binoculars or the naked eye.

3. Since the lights persisted I drew a reference line on the window pane as I was looking through binoculars from inside my quarters to check for any parallax. Suddenly the lights reappeared and I checked again and found that the position coincided with the reference line. This seemed to indicate that the lights were some distant object and not vehicles in the area. A check with the highway department revealed that a new road had recently been opened across the mountains, subjecting viewings revealed the lights in the same location as the new road and the reference line on the window. Therefore, it is reasonably certain that the lights were vehicle head and tail lights.

2. I regret the delay in answering your letter. This was due to my departure from Condon AFS on an extended leave shortly after the sighting.
