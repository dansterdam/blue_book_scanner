5. Elaboration on information previously furnished in 
initial report:

a. Item A (2)
Initial Mr. ______ was asked about the size of object at 
arm's length; he estimated the object could have been 
folded in half, would cover object.

b. Item A (3)
Mr. ______ was not able to furnish a specific 
reference. He was asked if the object had previously heard 
power lines make noises such as a "hum." Mr. ______ replied, 
"Yes, but this was a high-frequency, louder "buzz," and the 
noises the power lines could make at that distance. Real loud."

c. Item B (4)
Object moved east parallel with power lines until 
it changed its course to the south. This will be shown in 
illustrator's conception when completed.

6. Mr. gave the following sequence of events.
He was driving along about 12 o'clock at night, and saw something in the sky. What is said to be a couple of words (frankly i was scared) and a light went out and came back. He said we didn't get out of the car, we just sat pretty good, lead on the lead on the car. We lost sight of it for a little while. We saw it again and did not lose sight of it again until it seemed to make a swing with the stars. We did not see it again.

7. It is again reiterated that Mr. seems reliable and information requested in your letter dated 21 Dec 1966 will be forwarded when completed.
