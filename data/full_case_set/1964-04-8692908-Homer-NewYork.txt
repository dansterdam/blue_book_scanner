This whole episode took place in about forty-five minutes and ended in about thirty. However, the fact that all four stars attraction. However, the enclosed clippings are what prompted me to write to you relative to the New sighted at an altitude of 15,000 feet. I must admit that the report from there sounds wierd, but during World War II I was a pilot in the U.S. Air Force and all my flying experience was within the Continental limits of the United States. In all that time I never once, night or day, observed anything unusual in the skies. Now, at age 43, I have observed phenomena which are beyond my comprehension, and which has created in me a sense of reasoning and credulity.

LOCATION: HOMER, NEW YORK
DATE: APRIL 8, 1964

On 8 April 1964, at approximately 1930 hours, a civilian observer reported observing an unidentified flying object over the town of Homer, New York. The observer, whose name has been withheld, stated that he was outdoors observing the sky through binoculars when he noticed a small, bright object moving rapidly in the sky. The object appeared to be metallic in nature and was emitting a reddish-orange glow. 

The observer continued to track the object through his binoculars, noting that it made several erratic maneuvers, including abrupt changes in direction and speed. At one point, the object appeared to hover briefly before accelerating and disappearing from view. 

The observer immediately reported the sighting to the local authorities, who in turn notified the United States Air Force. An investigation was launched, and the incident was documented as part of Project Blue Book, the Air Force's official study of unidentified flying objects.

The accompanying photograph was taken by the observer during the incident and shows the view through his binoculars. A small, bright object can be seen in the close-up inset of the image. The quality of the photograph is poor, but it provides a visual record of the event as described by the observer.

This report has been filed as part of the official Project Blue Book archives, and the details of the incident have been duly noted for further investigation and analysis by the Air Force.

CASE NO. 8692908
LOCATION: HOMER, NEW YORK
DATE: 8 APRIL 1964

SUMMARY: At approximately 1830 hours on 8 April 1964, the witness observed several unidentified aerial objects in the sky near his home in Homer, New York. The objects were described as bright, glowing lights that maneuvered in an erratic manner. The witness was able to take several photographs of the objects before they disappeared. Upon investigation, no known aircraft or other conventional explanations could be found for the sightings.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a typed document containing a detailed description and analysis of a reported UFO sighting.

SUMMARY OF FACTS

Paint I. At first sighting of the dark end of the formation it was not giving off any visible surface. This happened as it neared the cloud formation and the vapor drifted to the North, according to my sight. However, I thought it was difficult to fly to the South as it disappeared and we can not agree.

Paint II. The vapor trail from the object was a great deal wider than an ordinary jet and wider than paint II had disappeared and should be discarded in the subsequent paints.

Paint III. The object appeared moving at a speed that I could not estimate and I could never the sight of the object with my two eyes. The object seen was a very large volume.

Paint IV. A very short time lapsed as object moved rapidly from left to right and then stopped again os shown in.

Paint V. There were no signs of other panels or jet trails in the sky below as the object was diving into two parts shown in clearly, the initial separation was indistinct and apparently positive to action.

Paint VI. As paint VI becomes to, and subsequently 5 as shown in closer or paint VII. Object should be more distinctly a globular shape.

At Paint 1 it is stated that the object did not continue to fall out speed to be absorbed and then disappeared into the cloud bank. At Paint II the object appeared to be divided into the distance or two smaller, (approximately) on horizon, if seemed with either light at some sluggish in Paint I delimitately appeared to be of material substance and not just a cloud formation.

Distance object traveled from Paint III to Paint IV where it shot forward seven times on a wider hat at one's length.

Dearborn Observatory, Northwestern Univ.

Dear Dr. Hynek,

Apparently our minds were operating on the same wave length last week, because of the time delay your letter of February 10th, I was in the process of assembling the sketches and data and putting them together in a presentable form. I was honored to receive your telephone call and was pleased to discuss the sighting with you. I have re-read my letter to you for the first time since it was sent and realize that I contradicted myself in some of the details.

One point is that the jet trails actually appeared from west to east as stated in the letter and not vice-versa as I had stated in my telephone conversation. Since our conversation I have returned to the location of the sighting and as nearly as I can remember it to be find that the tail of the object was actually nearer the south of Skaneateles Lake and not very far as I stated to you. I further had also forgotten that I had mailed a copy of my letter to you to Stephen R. Killian of Sciota, 1955, whose essay is UFOe. However, I never heard from him and the copy I sent him was doubtless in our dead paper. Other than that I have discussed this matter only with close friends.

It is a strange what details one can forget in six months time and you caught me at a very busy time in my office so that my recall was not too quick on the matters we discussed. I am enclosing herewith seven prints of the sighting which my wife assisted me just description of the same and I intend to return to the location to have photographs made for your reference.

In the event there is anything further wherein I can be of assistance to you in your research of similar situations, kindly advise and I will be very happy to do so. Thanking you very much for your interest herein, I remain,

Sincerely yours,

[Signature]

Dr. Condon, New York

Dear Dr. Condon,

I am still very much interested in the sighting which you made last April, but I am no closer to a solution than I was before. I write this to remind you that you promised to send the sketches of the sighting which I believe you said your wife made.

You were not certain whether the original sketches still exist, but you indicated that if they did not, you would prevail upon your wife to reproduce them as best she can from memory. I hope that you will be able to favor me with this in the near future as I would like to include them in the case file.

I trust that everything else is well with you and that you are carrying your camera around with you.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director

Dear Major:

You will soon give me because instead of giving unintelligible. I appear to be a hightransmission which of a letter in your office. THAT LAST WAS OVER ORIGINAL WORDS, as I am sorry something I have already reported. A. Maj., was originally "Reported by".

Shall I say again, I am no "crank". This is was official, reported to Air Force Base as some official - and all the attitude detailed some explanation of the event, a belief in fact, was over original - words which is more a matter of personal characterization, or estimate, than fact, would have seemed more to point.

One point only, as a clarian representative, I will make any report you submit is matter of fact, and devoid of personalization.

As per your request, I'll go through certain portions of the statement you inquired about, not all incidentally as some points were to the over general disposition:

The object first appeared as a bright star, which we noticed its unusual brilliance. It gradually increased in size, as it approached, of course the direction was south, coming from the south. As it came closer, we could see it was a very large, definite, solid object, not like a distant star. The color remained a steady bright light. There were no tail, trail or other luminosity.

The motion at first was straight and "level", as we described it. Then it started a series of "dips" or "nodding" motions, up and down. The speed appeared moderate, I would estimate 300 to 500 mph.

At one point it came directly overhead, at an estimated altitude of 3,000 to 5,000 feet. We had an excellent view at this time, as it passed directly over us.

Then it made a sharp turn to the west, and continued on in that direction until it disappeared from sight over the horizon. The time elapsed from first sighting to disappearance was approximately 10 to 15 minutes.

There is one portion of the statement I would like to clarify or modify. The statement reads "it was definitely a solid metallic object, reflecting the sunlight". This could be interpreted as meaning the object had a metallic surface. A more accurate statement would be "it appeared to be a solid object, reflecting a bright light".

I hope this clarification is helpful. As I mentioned, I am anxious to cooperate fully in providing any factual information to assist your investigation.

Sincerely yours,

Text from the document:

TAKE 1.
2-4-64 - SJ. The object was first observed about 9:30 p.m., 2-4-64 by the two main witnesses, Mr. A and Mrs. B, who were in the kitchen of their home. It was observed for about 30 minutes till 10:00 p.m. The object was described as circular in shape, bright orange in color, and it seemed to be hovering or moving very slowly. It appeared to be about a mile distant and at an estimated altitude of about 3,000 feet.
The object appeared to come to a sudden stop, then make an abrupt turn and head off in another direction at a high rate of speed, then slow down again.
At one point, the object appeared to send out a beam of light which illuminated the ground below for a short distance. The object was observed to repeat this action several times.
There were no clouds in the sky and the weather was clear. No other unidentified objects were observed in the sky at this time.
The two witnesses, Mr. A and Mrs. B, are considered to be reliable, trustworthy, and intelligent observers. There is no reason to doubt their integrity or the accuracy of their observations.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Director, Dearborn Observatory

Chicago, Illinois

Dear Dr. Hynek,

I can appreciate that you probably receive hundreds of letters of this type, but if the information submitted herein assists you in any way in your research of this more, I am happy to submit it to you.

On April 11, 1964, my wife, two children (age 10 and age 14), and I were having a picnic supper on a hill 1800 feet above sea level, about ten miles northwest of Homer, New York. It was 6:30 p.m., and the day was partially clear with just a few scattered clouds on the western horizon. At about 6:00 p.m., several jet bombers had left vapor trails up high, traveling from east to west, but these trails quickly disappeared.

As I looked up in the sky a little to the northwest of us at about 6:50 p.m., I noticed that there appeared to be a small white cloud appearing, and it was very large and seemed to be about 1 mile long. After it appeared, there was a break on the trail of about 1 mile. Then a very black spiral formation appeared to be smoke appearing. We remarked that the white trail was unusual and the black portion looked dark because of the angulation of the glow of the setting sun behind the western hill several miles away.

The white vapor trail hung in the sky and gradually drifted to the south, slowly dissipating. Up to this point we were observing that we could see the bright blue sky and the continuation of the usual spiral trail, but the space and the continuation of the white trail was missing.

Approximately two minutes had passed and suddenly occurred to me that the black spiral cloud had slowly moved to the best where the white trail had drifted southward. Also, the cloud became much darker and we all observed this. At this point I took my 7 x 35 binoculars to observe it and was shocked to see what appeared to be bellowing out. It was causing rings of smoke trailing out. I continued to observe it through the binoculars for about 5 minutes.

Transcribing the text:

Page 2.
May 13, 1964

Was now slowly approaching the distant status cloud formation. Still retaining its spiral shape, changing from the horizontal position to a vertical position. The witness smoke and resembled a smoking plane slowly falling from the sky. At the same time strange objects seemed to be falling but soon stopped as if they reached a certain distance. Then they moved upward again, to be repeated several times. This strange phenomenon plainly visible to the naked eye.

After about three minutes had elapsed while we were all convinced that what we were seeing would disappear as suddenly as it had appeared, a horizontal pencil shaped object suddenly appeared, resembling a "there's another one". It appeared as a horizontal pencil in length, but it could have been of larger size as seen from the left. For some reason it appeared to confirm the length, but it could not be agreed as to whether this was the original object or another corresponding with the first object, as the first object became obliterated by the cloud. 

As I was observing this with my binoculars, there was a flash of white light from the rear of it and it shot forward with incredible speed for a distance of about five times its length and as suddenly stopped, still maintaining the pencil shape, apparently hovering. My companions inside the house did not observe it as I watched it with the binoculars. It became thick in the middle and with a cloud of smoke emerging from the backward as if it had gone forward. Again it hovered and then the most incredible part occurred - from the saucer shape it developed into two parts, one moving away rapidly from the other. The top object, very small, remained stationary, while the second object seemed to expanded and contracted in size. The top object slowly became smaller, dimmer, and finally disappeared at a 45 degree angle toward the spot where it had appeared. The bottom object did not fade completely but the bottom object now shaped differently from the higher oval object. This pencil shape slowly faded away to the side. Then the pencil shaped object also faded from sight.
