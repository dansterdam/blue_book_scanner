The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report form. The form includes details such as the date, time, location (West Carrollton, Ohio), source (civilian), number of objects observed (one), type of observation (ground-visual), and physical evidence (none). The form also includes a "Brief Summary and Analysis" section, but the text in that section is obscured and not legible.

The image appears to contain two sketch illustrations. The larger sketch on the left depicts a compass rose, with the cardinal directions labeled. The instructions below the compass rose indicate that the viewer should place an "X" at the position of the phenomenon when it was first seen, and a "D" at the position when it was last seen, to schematically show the movement of the phenomenon.

The two smaller sketches on the right appear to show the observed phenomenon from different perspectives, with the sky and landscape visible in each sketch.

There is no photograph present in this image. The text that can be extracted from the document is:

"NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "D" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "X" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "D" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. THE ARROWS THAT IS SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT OCCURRED IN A STRAIGHT LINE OR ERRATIC, AND SERVE TO IDENTIFY AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE EXCESS SKETCH."
