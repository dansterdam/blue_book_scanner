Dear Sirs:
On July 20, 1969, at 12:42 p.m. while driving my car near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, I saw what appeared to be a large, metallic, disc-shaped object like a gelatine mold (for disn) traveling from North to South. It was traveling slowly at first. Then it made some erratic maneuvers and appeared to be in trouble, as if it was losing control. It speeded up and got out of sight in a matter of a couple minutes.
The object was of a bright metallic color and was cut off at the top and bottom, (it was) very disk-shaped. It was about 50 feet in diameter and made no sound at all. It was not too far up, estimated at from 1,000 to 2,000 feet altitude.
I am interested in U.F.O.'s and did not wake anyone else because I did not want to get laughed at. I did not notify anyone, I did not make a report to the Air Force because I'm not sure what I saw and I didn't want to be labeled a nut.
If you have any information I would appreciate hearing from you.
