MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD:

An attempt was made to recover the object that was reported to have fallen into Pensacola Bay on 15 July 1960. Due to the type of bottom, the presence of debris, and a shortage of funds, the recovery attempt was abandoned. The object observed was probably a large meterorite that failed to burn up in the earth's atmosphere, or possibly a part of an artificial earth satellite. However, due to the apparent size of the object, it was more probably a meteorite.

INVESTIGATION

3. This investigation is predicated on a telephonic request of 25 Jul 1960, from Major Thornton, USAF, CO, Pensacola NAS, Florida, to Hq, ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio, requesting the aid of Specialist Patterson. Major Thornton reported that an Unidentified Airborne Object had been sighted in the vicinity of Pensacola Bay, Florida, at approximately 2100 hours, 21 July 1960. Information was relayed to Specialist Patterson, who conducted an immediate field investigation. The facts, as determined during this investigation, are set forth as follows:

DETAILS

1. GENERAL DETAILS OF NAG-PENSACOLA, FLA, SIGHTING:
All 1, 1960, at approximately 2100 hours, CAPT T. F., LISAFO, on duty in the Control Tower at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, Florida, and his crew, observed and reported a large oblong object hovering at a high altitude over Pensacola Bay. The object remained stationary for several minutes and then was observed to take off at a high rate of speed and disappear from view.

CAPT F. provided the following additional details; The object appeared to be approximately 40 feet in diameter, oval or elliptical in shape, and of a dull metallic or aluminum color. It was estimated to be hovering at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet. The object gave off no light or visible exhaust, and made no detectable sound. CAPT F. estimated the object's speed at the time of take off to be in excess of 1,000 mph. The entire sighting lasted for approximately 5 minutes.

2. CORROBORATING EVIDENCE AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS:
In addition to the visual sighting by CAPT F. and his crew, radar personnel on duty at the Air Traffic Control Center at Pensacola NAS reported a target approximately 5 miles off shore, moving erratically and at a high rate of speed. These radar operator reported that the target appeared, hovered momentarily, and then disappeared from their scopes at a speed estimated as possibly seven or more times the speed of sound.

The radar data was further substantiated by Lt. G. USMC, who was conducting an instrument training flight in the area at the time of the incident. Lt. G. reported visually observing the unidentified object in the vicinity of Pensacola Bay, corroborating the details of the sighting as reported by CAPT F.

All persons involved in this incident are experienced, reliable aircraft observers, and their accounts are considered credible and worthy of serious investigation.

FLYING OBJECT REPORT
PENSACOLA, FLORIDA
JULY 7, 1960

1. On 26 July 1960, at approximately 11:35 P.M., Mr. and Mrs. [REDACTED] observed a UFO over Pensacola Bay, Florida.

2. The object first appeared to be a stationary light in the sky, but came down rapidly to an estimated 100 feet above the water and then hovered.

3. The object was brightly luminous and oval-shaped, approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. It appeared to have a row of windows or ports along the side.

4. On 26 July 1960, at about 4:30 A.M., Mr. [REDACTED], communications operator for the U.S. Navy, observed the object from the Naval Air Station. He was able to observe it for approximately 15 minutes. He stated that the object was at an estimated altitude of 100 to 150 feet and that it was hovering over the water and seemed to be searching the area, which might indicate that it was 
. From the Air Station, the object appeared very bright and luminous. It then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight into the southwest.

5. The area where the object was observed is an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico, and is a popular fishing and boating area. Several other witnesses reported seeing the object that night.

6. The Air Force, the Navy, and the FAA were all notified of the sightings, but no aircraft were known to be in the area at the time. The Air Force later stated that the sightings could not be explained.

FLYING OBJECT OR UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON

Into a shallow bay and lighted by an official light, the object hovered or "stood still" for several minutes, according to the report. The object was oval or circular in shape, a metallic color with a shiny, glassy surface, and it appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The object made no noise as to the sighting and were in accordance with the details contained in the official report submitted by the U.S. Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida, which was the responsible military agency for this area.

It had one main spherical portion and fins or protrusions from the rear section. The object was seen to occasionally wobble or oscillate on its axis. An individual, who was an American citizen, had previously been an employee of the U.S. Government and was at that time engaged in a civil capacity, reported the sighting. He was one of his charter party, and this person was an individual, who was well-qualified as an observer and who had had considerable experience in observing aerial phenomena.

6. On 9 Aug 1950, the military installation had an attendance at the Standard Oil Service Station that had recently been established nearby. The individuals were customers of the service station, and it was quite evident that they had seen some sort of aerial object, since they were in an excited and agitated condition, and their story was substantially the same as that contained in the official report.

7. On 10 Aug 1950, the individual who had made the original report visited the scene of the sighting. He could find no evidence of any physical disturbance, such as broken branches, disturbed foliage, or other indications that something had landed in the immediate area.

highly polished metal having the shape of two dinner-plate size faces to face. One
of the witnesses claimed that it had a diameter of 135 feet, and was 14 feet thick 
through the center. They transparency bubble projected from the bottom. 
The object was viewed by a family of 5 and took some 15 minutes to disappear. It

Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

I am writing again in regard to the UFO residuals which have been discussed in previous correspondence (see my letter dated 9 March 1960 which you answered 11 March 1960).

We have delayed sending this material to A. T. L. O. for several reasons. We feel for one thing that Air Force analysts should have an opportunity to study the complete history of the material before attempting tests on their own.

A complete report of this type has been prepared for some time but we have encountered problems in getting it published. These problems appear at present to have been resolved and copies will be forwarded to your office and to A.T.L.O. as soon as possible.

For reasons not entirely clear, you have chosen to withhold comment on our suggestion that the proposed tests be performed by an independent testing agency under the cognizance of USAF and APRO representatives.

I urge the sincere consideration of this procedure for this reason: The accumulation of evidence for the existence of these phenomena is such that certain grave inconsistencies between fact and Air Force public information releases have resulted. In a sense, our public confidence has been sadly shaken as frankly speaking, is shared by the military services. If we can arrange to have the results of any such tests on the materials concerned demonstrated, the good faith of all parties concerned.

I would also like to inquire whether or not the Air Force has reached any official conclusions concerning the following listed cases and, if so, what those conclusions are:

(1) The case at Red Bluff, California, August 13, 1960, involving Sgts. Scott and Cazen and Miller Clarence Fry (simultaneous viewing from two locations provided range and altitude data).

(2) The incident near Holloman (in Colorado Left Hand Canyon) on 11 August 1960 involving Ray Hawks. He stated "saucer" "repaired" itself in mid-flight, gained evidence of his director being shut off and described emotional reactions symptomatic of gamma radiation.

(3) The case at Locke, Wyoming involving five employees of the San Francisco Chemical Company who described a UFO hovering as if to land on a slag dump on July 3, 1960.

Sincerely Yours,
Coral E. Lorenzen

The Red Bluff, California sighting was probably due to the refraction of common objects such as aircraft that were seen in the general area during the period of the sightings. Information received about the general area does not indicate any unusual or reliable for each sighting cannot be determined, it is highly probable that the UFO seen by the highway patrol officers were the planet Mars.

Dear Mrs. -

This is to acknowledge your letter of 17 October 1960 concerning the possible UFO residuals that your organization claims to possess. We will, of course, be most interested in examining this material and any report or reports in connection with this data if made available.

The Air Force does not withhold comment on your suggestion that the separate incidents cannot be performed by an independent testing agency and I suggest that you do wish this with some responsible laboratory, or with us inter-service activities at the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center.

The Red Bluff, California sighting was probably due to the refraction of the moon through clouds which produced several light phenomena during the period of the sightings. While the actual object responsible for such sightings cannot be determined, it is highly probable that the U.F.O. seen by the highway patrol officers was the planet Mars.

The U.F.C. film mentioned could not contain any new significant evidence regarding cases of U.F.O. sightings occurring at Boulder, Colorado, 11 August 1960, or at Leets, Wyoming.

July 4, Mr. Mariqueta, Venezuela. The object was disk shaped, 22 feet in diameter, and was hovering about 500 feet above the ground. The family who witnessed the sighting said their house had been surrounded by a strong light for several minutes. When the object started to move, the light dimmed. The time was 10:00 PM. A plane was passing at the time but it was not the source of the light. The object was observed for about 15 minutes.

early morning hours of July 2nd, and three other occupants of his automobile were extremely frightened while driving through Illinois. According to the witness, the whole sky was lit up with a bright light, and according to the witness, this light appeared to be attached to a dark, elongated object. The witness stated that, when this phenomenon was first observed, it was directly overhead and appeared to be stationary. The witness further stated that, after a short period of time, the object began moving slowly toward the north.

FLYING SAUCER 
On July 5, 1960, at 5:15 A.M., I observed from the terrace of my house a white form moving in the sky. This form was circular and white, and many in size. It was in sight. It was clearly defined borders like a disc, very bright on the upper. It can be compared to a telescope focused on it with a small telescope, focusing on the form of light emanating from it. My wife, who was sleeping at the time, also saw this form as I called her. This is not an airplane, nor a star or planet, as they are known to us, and the stars were visible. I live in a place where the sightings have often been big and impressive. 
The form was at an approximate angle of 40 degrees from the horizon, slightly south-southeast, and was observed by me at approximately 40 degrees from the horizontal. It disappeared completely at 5:54 A.M. 
I am an attorney at law, also a master sergeant discharged from the army. I had the rank of captain. There are remarks that have some training in observation and objective analysis. - a. l. cam- , San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Gentlemen:

SUBJ: UFO Sighting Around July 4, 1960, Revere Beach, Mass.

After six years, you are probably wondering why I finally decided to report my sighting. Curiosity, time, and courage to write are my answers. I am now a somewhat member of the child, and I was in the library the came day and decided to obtain a book on UFOs.

A certain file was showing air force and UFO's. I came across a 1.5" folder (not name of author's correct name). In that book, I noticed that most letters from civilians are answered, even if a few time border the ridiculous.

Could you please tell me whether anyone reported this sighting and whether it has been explained or not. Approximately 3,000 people might have been watching the same Fourth of July fireworks and seen the same thing. Here is my story.

The Fourth of July Fireworks were held within a few days XXXXX of the 4th, 1960. My then boyfriend XXXXX of Sellem, Mass. (who has not been for five years) and myself were parked along the beach waiting for the fireworks to begin at about 10:00 p.m. About 9:45 p.m.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

I watched or strange disk in the sky a little piece of ground of center of ship (drawing to follow) I mentioned to be so and he said to had been watching the disc in sky, they gave call on phone close nearby 11:00 p.m. We then continued to watch this object which was not moving. Put his head out the window to make sure It wasn't a reflection. We pulled out the moon for reasons I can't remember now. We watched it for about another twenty minutes before to move slowly down in direction of town. It was hard to tell how low to the horizon as It was out some distance. That was about 5:10 p.m. that we began to move. About ten minutes later it seemed another disk like object move to the right of the one we had been watching. His first one could not be seen. We watched about another ten minutes before they disappeared. We were amazed at what we saw because it was so unusual and we both closed by the time first class. We watched about another 20 minutes before they were way to the right of the car and heading to the night of the car and seemingly had nothing to do with what we saw. I had to answer me and tell me "whether there is any explanation for this sighting," because it took a lot of courage to tell it.
