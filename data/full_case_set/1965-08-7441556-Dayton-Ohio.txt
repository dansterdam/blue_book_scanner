The image does not contain any photographs, but rather includes a sketch or diagram. The sketch depicts a curved horizon line and a compass rose, along with instructions for the observer to mark certain positions on the diagram to illustrate the motion and position of an unidentified object or objects that were observed.

"27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Call from Virginia Lovett (NICAP Member), 101 Marathon, Dayton, Ohio, she observed an unidentified object on 5 Aug 55. Sgt Moody said that from the description she was giving and at the time she saw it the object was apparently the satellite Pegasus I. She kept insisting that it couldn't be this and that she was going to report her sighting to NICAP. Sgt Moody said that was her privilege to report it to NICAP if she wanted to. She consented to fill out an AF FORM 164 that we would mail her.

(Use as much space as necessary)
I saw a lighted object or objects which had a round, circular shape and appeared to be a group of brightly lighted objects, with pulsating or flashing lights. The objects appeared to move up and down and from side to side at a very rapid rate of speed. The objects did not appear to have any distinguishing features other than lights. The objects did not appear to have any wings or other obvious structural features. The objects appeared to be moving at a very high rate of speed but did not appear to make any sound.

Based on the image, there is no photograph present on this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains only text and illustrations.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" the object you first saw, then on "B" the location of the object when you first saw it. Place on "C" the direction the object was traveling when you first saw it. Place a "D" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Place an 'A' on the curve: line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an 'A' on the compass where you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the compass where you last saw the object."

The image also contains a drawing prompt that says "28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on 'A' at the beginning of the path, a 'B' at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course."

This page from the Project Blue Book file does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a questionnaire or report form with a handwritten response in the space provided.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: [Blank]
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

The handwritten response states:
"The fight may center on noise & the sighting appear to be somewhat insignificant, but the significance of their actions is important, for they had no visual object to confirm their chase. This is the type of incident that needs to be taken seriously, for it may mean nothing, or it may mean a great deal - with no physical evidence."
