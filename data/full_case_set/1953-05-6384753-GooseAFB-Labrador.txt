4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 2
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 45 minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground and airborne
7. COURSE: Circular
8. PHOTOS: Yes
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
10. CONCLUSION: The objects observed were considered to be unidentified flying objects and could not be positively identified as any known type of aircraft, meteor, or other natural phenomenon.
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: At approximately 1900 hours local time on 7 February 1953 two unidentified flying objects were sighted from Goose AFB, Labrador. The objects were observed on a circular course at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. They remained in view for approximately 45 minutes before disappearing from sight. Visual observation and photographic analysis indicated the objects were definitely not conventional aircraft, meteors, or other known phenomena. The objects remained unidentified.

SAGINTSUM No. 726 - Goose Bay, Labrador
At 0302Z and at 0325Z on 2 May 1953, two unidentified objects were observed from Goose Bay Control Tower. This sighting was investigated by an F-94 pilot, who was scrambled to intercept the objects. The pilot tried but could not make visual contact with the objects. The objects were first sighted by the F-94 controller, and were described as luminous and approximately 500 yards in length. According to this source, the light was probably an unidentified a/c.
The second observation was also from the air, when the pilot and copilot of a commercial airlines reported sighting two luminous objects approximately 500 yards off the right wing of their a/c. The plane was located 120 miles SE of Goose Bay at the time of sighting.

NEGATIVE ANSWER- THE CONTROLLER IN THE GOOSE TOWER ALSO TOLD ME THAT ONE PERSON WAS HURT AND ASSISTED FIRST AID. A LARGE OBJECT WAS SEEN FLYING OVER TURF STATION AND THEN IT CAME DOWN AND DUE SOUTH GOOSE AS AIRCRAFT WAS IN A PORT ORBIT WHICH WAS ABOUT IN THE SAME AREA WHERE FIRST SIGHTING. ACCORDING TO THE TOWER THE SIGNAL OFF THE OBJECT 22293792 WAS RECEIVED BY THEM, 2ND LT BROWN, WHOM THE TOWER RELAYED THIS TO.

I HAVE 1292 HOURS FLYING TIME OF WHICH 2080 HOURS ARE AS JET AIRCRAFT. THIS IS THE FIRST SIGHTING I HAVE EVER SEEN. ASIDE FROM THE STRANGE BEHAVIOR OF THE OBJECT, THE MOST REMARKABLE THING ABOUT IT WAS ITS TREMENDOUS SPEED AND THE APPARENT LACK OF ANY VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION. AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST SIGHTING IT WAS AT AN ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 2500-3000 FEET AND THE OBJECT CAME DIRECTLY TOWARD ME ATTAINED A SPEED OF PROBABLY 1000-1500 MPH AND THEN MAKE A SHARP 90 DEGREE TURN AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. I WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN ATTEMPTS TO MAKE RADIO CONTACT WITH IT. BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE CONTACT COULD HAVE CAUSED, I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO INTERCEPT OR FOLLOW IT. I HAVE A STATEMENT FOR THE 15-7 REPORT THAT I WAS PREPARING, CAPT EMBERS REPORT.

Text transcription:

THE TIME OF THE FIRST SIGHTING WAS AT 2:00 P.M. AND THE OBJECT WAS FIRST OBSERVED FROM THE GROUND BY SEVERAL CIVILIAN OBSERVERS WHO MAINTAINED A VISUAL CONTACT, BUT UNEXPLAINED MANEUVERS, BEFORE DISAPPEARING INTO THE CLOUDS. THE OBJECT EMPLOYED RADIO CONTACT WITH A GOOSE AFB RADAR BUT NO OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA COULD MAKE RADAR CONTACT WITH IT BECAUSE OF THE ANGLE OF THE OBJECT FLIGHT AND ITS APPARENT SPEED. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR WITH ONLY A FEW HIGH SCATTERED CLOUDS. THERE WAS NO LOG EXHAUST OR ANY CHANGE IN COLOR OF THE OBJECT AS IT MOVED. DETAILS OF SPEED AND APPARENT SIZE WHEN COMPARED TO THE BACKGROUND BY THE OBSERVERS AND PILOT WERE UNABLE TO BE DETERMINED ACCURATELY EXCEPT THAT IT WAS MOVING AT A SPEED MUCH GREATER THAN ANY JET AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA AT THE TIME. THERE WAS NO SOUND COMING FROM THE OBJECT. THAT LOOKED LIKE AN F-84 WITH AFTER BURNERS TURNED ON. AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES THE OBJECT MADE A RADAR CONTACT, WHICH LASTED FOR A BRIEF PERIOD BEFORE DISAPPEARING AT A VERY HIGH SPEED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN DIRECTION.

PAGE FOUR JEXER 7c
OBJECT - BOTH OBJECTS WERE MOON SHAPED, WAS SIGHTED DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF CLOUDS AND GIVEN CHASE BY 1 L T. GOY, GOOSE AFB PILOT, AT 16,000 FEET. ONE OBJECT APPEARED LARGER AND BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER. THE VISIBILITY OF THE AREA WAS UNLIMITED FOG OR VAPORS WERE NOT ENCOUNTERED. THIS PILOT DID NOT HEAR ANY ENGINE NOISE NOR SEE ANY EXHAUST FROM THE OBJECTS. COMMENT - PICTURES BEING TAKEN OF OBJECTS AND NO PLANS EVALUATED AS IDENTIFIED WHEN COMPARED TO KNOWN BALLOONS OR OTHER AIRCRAFT.
CONFIGURATION - COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY'S PILOT AND CO-PILOT MARITIME CENTRAL AIRWAYS, STATED THEY HAD SIGHTED SIMILAR LIGHTS AS UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS. MESSAGE RECEIVED THIS HQ 2314393.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

On the night of 6 May 1953 I was the pilot of F-94C, Ser. No. 51-13451, call sign "SLICK 23". At about 2350 hours local time while flying at 25,000 feet over Goose AFB, Labrador, I saw an unidentified luminous object.

The object was first observed approximately 30 miles west of Goose AFB, and was traveling in a northeasterly direction at an estimated speed of 1,000 to 1,500 knots. It appeared white in color and seemed to pulse or change in brightness at irregular intervals. The object made no sound and left no trail.

I attempted to intercept the object but it pulled away rapidly and disappeared from view within 60 seconds. I lost visual contact with the object at a range of approximately 20 miles.
