RELATIVE SIZES. (3) COLOR - THE SIX LIGHTS ON THE PERIMETER OF THE
CIRCULAR PHENOMENON WERE DESCRIBED AS BEING A DULLISH YELLOW AND
STAR-COLORED. WITHIN THE CENTER OF THE


MOVING CIRCLE WAS A BRILLIANT, BLUISH-GREEN LIGHT AND SLIGHTLY TO
THE RIGHT OF THAT LIGHT, STILL WITHIN THE CIRCLE, WAS A SECOND
REDDISH LIGHT. THE LIGHT WHICH TRAILED THE OBJECT WAS A DULL
ORANGE. HE ALSO DESCRIBED IT AS LOOKING LIKE A FLYING CHRISTMAS
TREE AS IT APPROACHED. (WHEN OVERHEAD, ITS CIRCULAR SHAPE WAS
APPARENT.) (4) NUMBER-- TWO OBJECTS. (5) FORMATION-- BOTH TRAVELLED
VERY CLOSE TOGETHER AND REMAINED IN A CONSTANT POSITION RELATIVE TO
EACH OTHER DURING THE SIGHTINGS. THE SECOND OBJECT WAS BESIDE AND
SLIGTHLY TO THE REAR OF THE THE LEADING ONE. (6) OBSERVER SAYS HE
COULDN'T DISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT THE LIGHTS. HE AVERRED THAT HE DID
NOT see ANYTHING RESEMBLING AN EXHAUST FLAME. HE EXPLAINED THAT FOR
LACK OF A BETTER TERM, HE CALLED THE LAST TRAILING LIGHT A TAIL. (7)

NO CHANGE IN LIGHT CONFIGURATION DURING THE FIRST THREE PASSES. ON
FOURTH PASS, HOWEVER, THE OBSERVER STATES HE SAW AN EXPLOSION-LIKE
FLASH AND THE CONFIGURATION HANGED TO FOUR SMALLER, SOLID CIRCLES
OF LIGHT. IMMEDIAIELY AFTER THE EXPLOSION (NO SOUND) THE ORIGINAL
CONFIGURATION WAS NOT VISISLE -- INSTEAD, ONLY THE FOUR CIRCLES.
THE CIRCLES SEEMED TO HOVER MOTIONLESSLY IN A SQUARE PATTERN. THEN
SUDDENLY TWO ACCELERATED ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY AND ZOOMED OVER
THEIR HEADS INLAND AT AN ENORMOUS RATE OF SPEED. THE TWO REMAINING
CIRCLES RETURNED TO THE CONFIGURATION WHICH BY NOW WAS AGAIN VISIBLE.
THAT ALL HAPPENED SO RAPILY THAT THE OBSERVER CANNOT BE SURE WHETHER
