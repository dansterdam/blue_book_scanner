AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

1. On 3 November 1952, at 0002Z, R-29 1/12, on route from Argentina, encountered a brilliant light which came up through an overcast. Location of the sighting was Lat. 49째27' S, Long. 53째30' W, over the Atlantic Ocean. Pilot stated that he observed the light for approximately 1 minute and 25 seconds. The light was a brilliant white color and seemed to disappear as it went into the overcast.

2. At the time, the Airport advised that no other aircraft except the R-29 was in the area. No other aircraft or surface vessels under their control were in the area at the time.

3. Flight No. SA-10 #4028 was dispatched to investigate the area of sighting at 0120Z. A search was conducted for approximately one hour but no further information was obtained due to a second incident.

4. Both the pilot and co-pilot overheard VHF traffic on "DB" channel and, according to their statement, were convinced that some sort of reflection of aircraft were near the area. Voices were described as being unintelligible.

5. To clarify this incident further, an investigation was conducted by the Intelligence Officer relating the background information. The crew of the R-29 is well acquainted with the sighting. The sighting was considered unusual and merited investigation.

UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
IR-072-F
Date: November 23, 1951
At 0430, 6 November 1951, a light was sighted and arrived at 0443Z. The light was bright and visible, was off and on, and flashed green and white. It was flat above and convex below, and was estimated to be about 40 feet in diameter. There was no sound or trail, and it appeared to approach a plane at high speed and then pull away. No radar contacts were recorded, and it was reported that the light could have been a flash of lightning. A low search was instituted, but no clues were found.
The overall evaluation of the investigation by Captain Orin was that this instance appeared to be an unidentified aerial phenomena, and many illusions which easily could be confused as a pilot. The U. S. Coast Guard did not utilize these objects in any way, and vessels only in cases of distress or emergency.
