Sighting of Unconventional Aircraft, Sioux City, Iowa
IOWA
23 Jan 51

1. Reference is made to Teletyp. no. 13 OSI 87, dated 22 Jan 51, from OSRNT R-4, regarding sighting of an unidentified object.
2. The subject sighting can be classed as confirmed information since two power contrellers have observed the object as 5:45 on 23 Jan 51, and their observations confirm the earlier report.
3. The general trend of the reported sighting is similar to previous sightings which indicate that the unidentified object had the characteristics of an aircraft but behaved in an erratic, unconventional manner with a speed and performance exceeding that of contemporary airplanes. The pilot of the transport airplane then concludes to give a fairly detailed description of the color, size, shape, maneuvering, and above-normal performance capability.
4. On the basis of the above analysis, it is desired to point out that an interpretation of certain local reports indicates that this incident could be easily discredited.
5. The reported final conclusions are difficult to state at this time. However, revealed information gives rise to a belief that the identity or nature of this object might be more closely related to some unusual celestial phenomenon rather than an aerial vehicle of this world. The unusual lights observed in the sky in colors varying from yellowish-white to red seems to verify this.
6. Action has been taken to have the CIC-3D forward the additional data as soon as available. It may be necessary to institute additional measures on the subject sighting until the additional data is received.
7. The responsibilities of the Air Defense Command in connection with visitations of this kind should be more firmly established than currently appears to be the case.

Kearna City, Missouri
28 January 1951
C.I. 23 January 1951. At 2:26 hours, I was piloting a P-51 Gentilen interceptor, callsign to the Sioux City Tower Airport and landed by a forced landing at approximately 3:30 hours. When our aircraft was 48 miles northwest of the field. We were unable to lower the landing gear, and as a result we were forced to make a belly landing. After a thorough inspection, it was determined that the difficulty was caused by a complete failure of the electrical system. The object was reported by the trailing pilot, Ltn. Doyle C Erwin, to be a bright light, approximately 8 to 10 feet in diameter, observed at 3:20 hours, estimated to be 3 to 5 miles ahead of the aircraft.
It was moving in a north-to-south direction at a high rate of speed, estimated to be in excess of 600 mph. The object was sighted out of the corner of the eye and as the object was approached, it suddenly disappeared. No other details could be determined, and there were no indications of any damage or malfunction of the aircraft as a result of the incident. The object appeared to always be under perfect control, and moved at a wide arc around the aircraft and was observed to be gaining in altitude as it moved away. The observer, Ltn. Erwin, stated that it appeared to be "shooting upward" and that it was visible only for perhaps 5-10 seconds.
The tower operators also reported seeing the object as it moved away from the aircraft. I can add nothing further to this report, except that the object appeared to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed and changed direction and altitude with ease, which was not characteristic of any known aircraft.

Sight Strange Aircraft Over Sioux City; It Does Tricks New to Pilots
Airline Flier Describes Amazing Performance By Huge Ship

Kansas City, Jan. 27. - (AP)- A veteran airline pilot Sunday night told of sighting a strange aircraft at Sioux City, Iowa, that did something "you just can't do with airplanes today."

Larry W. Vinther, of Kansas City, Mo., said the incident occured over Sioux City. He said the pilot who has been flying airlines for 23 years and has never seen anything like it before.

Vinther said the incident occurred while he was flying a transport plane west of Sioux City. He said he and the co-pilot suddenly sighted the strange craft in the air.

He described the strange aircraft as being as large or half again as large as a B-29 bomber. He said it had a long, slender fuselage, long wings and was traveling "very fast" and higher than his own plane.

The mystery plane was observed by Vinther's First Officer, James V. Bachman, and also by the co-pilot of another airliner which was following just behind Vinther's plane. 

Vinther said the strange aircraft was first sighted just off the side of Sioux City. It then circled the town and then zoomed straight up into the sky, making a 90 degree turn, and then zoomed straight down again. 

"There were no engine noises," Vinther said. He said the wings were straight, not swept back like on the B-29 and other jets. "There were no jet pipes visible," he said.

Vinther said the craft was seen by his copilot, James V. Bachman, of Kansas City, and one of the 18 passengers aboard.

"As it was getting lower, clear-ing for take-off from the Sioux City field, it suddenly zoomed straight up at terrific speed - about 25,000 feet I'd say," Vinther said, "the tower asked us to check on the strange light in the sky." 

Vinther said when they looked again, the plane had disappeared. "We saw the plane had some sort of fuselage light in addition to the ordinary lights. The plane made all kinds of maneuvers that would be utterly impossible for any known plane," Vinther declared.

"It was able to make turns and stop and start that you just can't do with airplanes today. It maneuvered in a way that left us absolutely bewildered. We were in consultation with the control tower and the other plane and no one could understand what it was."

Vinther said his DC-3 was doing 150 miles an hour and the other craft was going faster than that in the opposite direction. "It had just turned my head when there he was again, flying straight toward us about 200 feet to our left, going in the same direction we were."

Text from the document:

"Elf in a Mid-Continent Airlines Craft said 'No wings were straight, not a swell- nothing like one of our jet bambers, and there were no jet ports visible.'  James J. Stechscher, of Spence Air and one of the 11 passengers aboard, said 'As we took off from the Sioux City field at 6:20 o'clock,' Vintner said, 'the tower called in to say something was wrong with the flight in the sky.'
'We spotted the light and it seemed to be hovering, we followed it,' he said. 'Then the light went out just like that,' he said, snapping his fingers to illustrate.  Vintner said his DC-3 was doing 120 miles an hour and the other craft was going faster than that in the opposite direction.  'I just turned my head from watching him go past our wing when there he was again, about 20 feet to our left, going in the same direction we were,' he said.
'They mystified him because 'we just can't turn as fast.'  This strange plane flew 'very, very fast' and 'at a terrific speed.'
The strange plane flew below the DC-3 and Vintner said he checked his compass and found the plane was flying southeast at Omaha.  He said he checked the airport and found no air-force jet planes scheduled in that area."

Reports grew today of a startling performance by a strange plane over the city Saturday. The plane, which was moving at a high rate of speed, was observed by several persons, including Captain Richard L. Keith of the Iowa air guard and First Officer Donald H. Schuck of Central Airlines.
Captain Keith said the plane was first spotted by him and Schuck shortly after 1 p.m. Saturday as it passed over the airport at an estimated altitude of 3,000 feet.
"We were on the ground at the time," Keith said, "and we both saw the plane go over. It was moving at a terrific rate of speed - much faster than any jet plane I've ever seen. I'd say it was traveling at least 1,500 miles an hour."
Keith said the plane disappeared in a northeasterly direction. A few minutes later, he said, it was spotted again, this time over the downtown area, where it was seen by several other persons.
Robert McNeely, Sioux City, said he saw the plane as it passed over the downtown section. "It was traveling at a terrific rate of speed," he reported. "It appeared to be silvery in color and was going in a northeasterly direction. I'd estimate its altitude at about 3,000 feet."
The plans described by the fliers and other observers were similar to reports received by the air force of "flying saucers" and other strange aerial phenomena.
At the Sioux City air base, it was stated that "we have no knowledge of any high-speed aircraft in this area at the time the plane was reported seen."

The text of the article is as follows:

A STRANGE AIRCRAFT IS SEEN OVER SIOUX CITY BY KANSAS CITY PILOT
WHAT CANNOT BE PERFORMED BY THE AIRPLANES OF TODAY? "WINTHER SAYS"
A VETERAN air line pilot told of seeing the strange light in the air near Sioux City tonight. Vinsther, Continent Airlines pilot who has been flying for 20 years, said that while approaching the Sioux City airport he saw a strange light in the air.
The light seemed to be about the size of a B-29 with a long narrow fuselage and four long, straight wings, Vinsther said. The light seemed to be about 5,000 feet up. 
"The exhaust glow," Vinsther said, "seemed to be coming from the wingtips and I saw no other lights on the craft." 
Vinsther explained he watched the craft for some time and it seemed to be maneuvering at the edge of the field, he said. However, there were no navigation lights, in addition to the strange light illuminating the craft.
Vinsther said when he got back to the city, his first action was to tell his co-pilot, James P. Hawthorne, what he had seen. Hawthorne, Vinsther said, was more interested in the business of getting the plane landed, but one of the eleven passengers, a woman sitting directly behind the pilots, also saw the strange craft.
Vinsther said the craft was getting lower and lower until it finally disappeared when the plane was on the ground, and he could not see it any longer. He said the plane was not attempting to land and that it seemed to disappear into the darkness.

ANOTHER SAUCER MYSTERY
This article is reprinted from the RIO GRANDE VALLEY TIMES, HARLINGEN, TEXAS, with permission.
HARLINGEN, TEXAS - More evidence of strange objects in the sky is available this week as a result of the report received by the Air Force from the Sioux City, Iowa Airport.
A civilian pilot, Captain E. S. Lewis, apparently saw a strange object in the sky over Sioux City, Iowa, Friday afternoon, January 5, 1951, shortly after 1:30 P.M.
The report received from the Sioux City Airport was forwarded to the Air Force which is investigating the incident as part of Project Blue Book. The Air Force report states that Captain Lewis was flying at an altitude of approximately 4,000 feet when he sighted the object.
The object which Captain Lewis observed was described as being approximately 50 feet in diameter, disc-shaped, and having a silver color. The object was observed for about 20 minutes as it seemed to hover and then moved rapidly away.
No sound was heard by Captain Lewis as the object left the area. The object was also observed by a number of other people on the ground in the Sioux City area. Their reports generally agreed with the description given by Captain Lewis.
This sighting adds to the growing body of evidence of strange objects in the sky which have been reported in various parts of the United States and other countries in recent months. The Air Force has been investigating all reports as part of its Project Blue Book and has stated that so far no definite conclusions have been reached. The reports continue to come in, however, and there is still much speculation and discussion concerning these mysterious objects which have been observed.
