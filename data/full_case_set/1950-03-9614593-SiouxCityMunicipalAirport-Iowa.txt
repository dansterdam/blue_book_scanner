11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Flight while a T-6 A/C flight was above and below this. This was below 1000 ft. to be about Â½ the size of the A/C. The object moved rapidly. Shaped like a small parachute. No noise. Object traveling northwest. Collision with A/C during this trip. Course headed my way. Weather was hazy. This may be an illusion as not reported. Disappearance was rapid after the collision. Possible that debris from the A/C was the cause of this sighting.

Weatherman Spots a Saucer High Over Iowa

SIOUX CITY, Iowa, March 31 - Fourteen Iowans today joked the sighting of a rain-racing, mysterious "object" here Friday. 

A C. Jesse, employee of the U.S. Weather Bureau, said he saw the strange saucer-shaped object as he was leaving the Weather Bureau office. He first thought it was a weather balloon, but when I decided it wasn't, he said.

Mr. Jesse said the object appeared to be about 1,000 feet up and was moving at a tremendous speed, perhaps 10,000 to 12,000 miles per hour. It flashed out of sight in a second and a half. Mr. Jesse said it was shaped like a "flying saucer" and was shiny, pencil-shaped.

Other witnesses who were interviewed said they saw the object as well, but have denied any knowledge of the saucer.

Weatherman Spots a Saucer High Over Iowa
By the United Press
SIOUX CITY, Iowa, March 31 -- Fourteen Iowans, including the sweaihig ranks of the U.S. Weather Bureau, said they saw a silver discus-like object, which they thought at first was a weatherman's weather observation balloon.
"Then I decided it wasn't," he said.
Mrs. Jess said the object appeared to be about the size of a small automobile and that it flashed out of sight. At the same time, she said, the object made a slight roaring noise.
Simon City officials who have had some experience in observational work at the Municipal Airport said the object appeared to be white, round "something" apparently following a straight line course. 
U.S. Air Force officials repeatedly have denied any knowledge of the saucer reports.
