The image contains no photographs, but there is a sketch consisting of two oval shapes with a line indicating direction and a compass rose depicting orientation. The ovals appear to represent the purported UFOs with an arrow indicating their motion from West to East. There are also handwritten notes on the wind direction near the bottom right of the page.

The image appears to be a grayscale, somewhat overexposed photograph of what seems to be a parachutelike object or some type of aerial downed craft descending from the sky. The object has numerous lines extending downward, which are likely cords or shrouds, attached to a central point or assembly, which is consistent with a parachute design.

[Redacted] Insert Sputnik II at Atlanta after [Redacted] for an ...
Scientists at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in
calculating the course of Sputnik II was somewhat over the south
part of the U.S. at that the reported sighting. They stood by an
earlier prediction that the satellite would come within Saturday
afternoon or evening.

What was presumably the same object was seen by the pilot of a
F-47 jet somewhere flying near Monroe, La., and the pilot of a T33
jet trainer from Keesler AFB, Miss. The latter said it broke in two
and looked like a missle.

The sightings were reported to the air traffic control tower at
New Orleans, which referred them to the Air Force Flight Service
at Montgomery, Ala., for further checking.

At the Air Force Base, Montgomery, Ala., Major and Public Relations
had no report of the sighting.

A Hathaway, La., housewife, Mrs. [Redacted] [Redacted] reported seeing the object going west to east.
She said the object was "brilliant (orange colored) light" and about the size of
the moon on the second.
