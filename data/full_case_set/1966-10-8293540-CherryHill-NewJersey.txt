Dear Mr. [redacted],

Reference your letter of 9 February 1967 reporting a recent unidentified flying object by yourself and other witnesses. The information submitted to the Air Force by way of your letter is insufficient for a detailed study. It is requested that you complete the enclosed AF Form 164 so that a more comprehensive evaluation is possible. We would also appreciate it if your wife and [redacted] would complete the Form 164.

We do not discourage the release of any type of information. This is your privilege and not that of the Air Force.

Dear Friends:

After receiving your letter of March 16 I sent a copy of it (with your names and addresses omitted) to my friend Dr. R. W. Engstrom, president of the Radio Corporation of America.

He opines that "I have checked with a number of my associates and have not found anyone who is aware of any incident which would result in the report of the landing of an RCA building in Cherry Hill, New Jersey." From RCA's point of view, we believe that it is perfectly proper for the person who made this observation to explain to you exactly what he believed he saw on this occasion.

I suppose we will have to leave it at that unless you have some suggestions about other things that ought to be done.

Sincerely,

EUC: kes

Feb. 9, 1967

Dear Sir:

We did learn of your position as head of Project Blue Book to investigate U.F.O.'s, from the article published in LOOK special issue on Flying Saucers.

We have for some time been wondering whom to contact (as we do not want to be made fun of) to relate the mysterious flying sauchin we witnessed in flight as seen over our home in our small town community, as prominent manufacturers of electronic and computing equipment. 

We feel we should not give too much information at this writing as we do not want to write any description other than the facts that at about 5:00 p.m. one evening, my wife and I observed a tremendous speed and lights, this much we mention to convey to you that this incident could be a more accurate and vivid discription could be given, but in the event this is a classified or security type aircraft, as we understand you need security clearance to even enter the building on whose roof this aircraft, nor attached to the roofs or hovering over ground, and a considerable amount of activity such as vibrations was between the aircraft and the ground during several minutes while in sight.

We were parked approximately 300 feet away and for the length of time of ten minutes and from two different locations, this giving us a pretty good view. The aircraft first attracted our attention as it popped into space at tremendous speed and brilliant lights. As soon as it came, it dropped down very rapidly to about 10 or 12 feet above ground and this craft would not pass over, but just hung there as I looked up directly into the source of the bright lights that engulfed the highyly.

We would like to know if we could release the description of this incident, as we feel after reading some of the sightings which are being mentioned, but none of them what we have read about can give an account such as what we witnessed and where it took place.

Sincerely Yours,

SAFOI-CC/MAJ Rademacher/JSd/796759/19 Jun 67

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Blank,

This replies to your recent correspondence of May 25, 1967 in which you reported information on your unidentified sighting of October 25, 1966.

Unfortunately, you did not bring your sighting to our attention until February 28, 1967. The delay in reporting your observation prevented a timely investigation, since air activity records are normally destroyed within six months.

In the future, if you should observe another unidentified object, please contact the UFO Investigator at McGuire AFB, New Jersey, or Capt. Thomas J. Murnane, extension 4925.

Your observation has the flight characteristics of the Goodyear airship. Similar phenomena are associated with the Goodyear Company in the Northeastern United States and are usually attributed to one of their sightings. On October 30, 1966 one "Mip" was in California, and the other was enroute from Mason, Georgia to Daytona Beach, Florida.

A check of the records did not reveal any additional sightings on October 30, 1966 from the Cherry Hill, New Jersey area.

Sincerely,

BARRET B. YOUNG

Friday - 17 th. March 1967 
Day Month Year

Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I and my wife Mrs. G.T.H, first encountered this strange aircraft, Sun., Oct. 16,1966, 1:30 daylight saving time from Eagle Shade,N.J., to Camden,N.J. on Rt. 130, in our 1966 Chev. Station Wagon at the intersection of Cooley Ave. and Cuthbert Blvd., Cherry Hill, N.J. 

As we drove along we observed this object, it was brilliantly lighted, and as we approached it, the light changed from 0 to 45 mph, the complete area became brilliantly lighted as if it had turned on daylight. It showed distinct thinkinbgs the brilliance had become dim and switched to high beam, and this seemed to make any difference. I stopped in the middle of the road and looked through my side window and looked through my window on the passenger side. The object was still there and remained hovering at tree top height. It then changed from its hover to move directly overhead, and this seemed to me very large dirigible shaped aircraft hovering to my left at tree top height from the east. It would down and climb, and looked directly up at the starboard side of the ship which had a row of very large AMBER colored vertical windows whose sutrface was diffused, and if the surface of the windows were sand blasted to give them a degree of opacity. They are approximately 7 feet high and 10 feet wide. Emitting an eerie light that shown through them, and as they came together, they were separated by a curtain-like material a foot wide, forming a pattern. As it moved over us I looked down to see the brilliant lights on the starboard side of the craft, they would seem to go from south to north to south to north at tree top height with absolutely no noise, which passed directly over the car. I stopped and watched as it hung motionless for a split second. These lights are very large round electric arc or quarts lightning where are two of them, one on each side of center line of ship. There is a brilliantly lighted and exhaust system, which are used in conjunction as landing lights. If sighted to the side (passenger side) of the car which she did, as the ship moved over the car to the north and again hung motionless to could see the complete pattern which had a row of AMBER colored windows the same as the starboard side, running the length of the ship. The brilliance of the lights on the starboard side of the craft showed COLD RED and AMBER lights. We decided to continue on our way, not that we were afraid, but we had to pick up our daughter from her sitters in Gloucester, N.J., which was the reason we were on the highway at that hour of the morning. As we continued on our way, stopped to get gasoline, it was observed no. else was out making an unscheduled stop for gasoline, as we arranged, and on the way back, heading east on Rt. 38 above 5 AM we saw the vehicle again. The strange air ship we saw, and that it might be still in the area where we saw it. We went under the overpass of Haddonfield road slowly to about 10 mph, to see the area for this aircraft. When we looked past the Cherry Hill Inn to the R.G.A. building the strange aircraft was still above the roof. We continued to follow it to the R.G.A. building, it remained stationary above the roof. We shut off the motor of our vehicle and killed the ignition, and parked at the entrance road to the plant for about 5 to 10 minutes. 
The ship is silver metallic, egg or dirigible shape, approx. 3/2 feet long, and about 138 feet high. It has approx. 14 windows (4 on each side) on each side, these windows are approx. 20 feet wide, and 20 feet high, which forms an Amber band.

along each side. These windows , when the ship is parked or hovering, or in flight approx. 50 mph land speed in our atmosphere are still amber in color. The nose of the ship is like a large beacon which contains the inside front cowl' s, and passengers as a white light, from which could be seen that a radar type probe aerial, protruding from the cone, would direct through some internal survey controls. From which the only thing that could be determined was when this object was connected to a line or a cable which was in contact with the R G A roof' in the yards of one of the large tripped buildings, which extended 20 to 30 feet above the roof. There are several pulsating or blinking lights on the top edge of the ship from front to back. They are bright beacon type lamps, which appear to be used for navigation or flight clearance lights. The brilliant shifting or flashing light within the ship is only visible or on, when the ship is in flight, not while hovering or landed, as far as we saw it. There was no landing gear or curved bottom part of the ship which resembles an exit or entrance way, what looked like a cable type ladder to the foot of the R G A building, which could not be reached.
We parked there for 10 min. then moved to the entrance of the Cherry Hill base, still on the project, where the observation continued. We vacated the area, because we felt we might be observed.
We are still puzzled about this astonishing aircraft, that we witnessed. It would like to have our experience published, but we do not want to violate U.S. and R G A are working on, then we would refrain from any conversation about the subject. If on the other hand we could have your permission to publish this story, we would appreciate any information you would care to volunteer.

Lt Colonel, George E. Freeman, Jr.
USA Chief, Civil Engineering Division Office of Information

Dear Sir:

We are answering your letter of March 15, 1967, which accompanied PTD Form 164, relative to the dirigible type aircraft that flew over our car and anchored it's self to the roof of the R.C.A. plant in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. 

We filled out these forms with great detail and enthusiasm, and mailed them back within a couple of days, which has been about two months ago.

We are at this writing asking you for your comprehensive evaluation, that you said would be made upon filling out these reports, as we have become more aware of this dirigible type airship.

We have been enlightened considerably, but we are very interested in your findings about this airship. We would appreciate an early reply.

Yours truly,
Mr. & Mrs. [redacted]

Dr. Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138
Dear Dr. _____,
We read your letter and we are grateful, you took the time to answer. We untill the dirigible for over and looked as we described it the attached letter. We hardly ever gave the saucer reports any more than a passing glance, and hardly ever discussed them. Since we have been exposed to this airship, we started a little research program of our own, to find out about this dirigible. It is interesting what we have come up with, as most of our information has been found in our local library.
We have read where an airship that toured across a dozen states passing over many cities of our country, and this was before the seppiah was local inventors, this look place in 1896 - 1897. The ship we describe fits the description of many of the sightings that I have read, which were made by reliable spotters.
It seems incredible that this aircraft could fly and attached it's self to the Cherry Hill R.C.A as building and cause them to light up the entire plant at once on a early hour on a Sunday morning. And to leave an aware of it's presence or to completely disappear while the security that must exist in an industry doing Government work.
We have not say the while to enlighten this worldly ship, as we have a question that comes up when ever we sit and talk about the matter. The question is "if the ship is really of local origin as the answer to Cape Kennedy and it's efforts to go into space?. If the ship that did we learn from it and what did they learn from us, the night the ship visited R.C.A. Cherry Hill, N.J. If you could give us your own thoughts on these questions we would like to hear them.
Yours truly,
Mr. & Mrs. _____

OCR Output:
My wife and I first encountered this strange air-craft Sunday, Oct. 30,1966, at 1:30 A.M. EDT, while traveling west in our 1966 Chev. Station Wagon, when we encountered on Rt. 23 a strange Ave. light, which we estimated to be in the center to control traffic going east and west. We stopped to wait the green light, no overhead light, observing this strange light about 30 ft above the ground, and hovering over the highway. As we approached we noticed the headlights had become dim and watched as high beam and this seemed to make no difference. We stopped in the middle of the road and this seemed to make a difference as far as the headlights were concerned. The strange light was about 25 to 30 feet in diameter and was lowered to about 8 to 10 feet from the ground, and appeared to be glowing and the color of the glass, as if the surface of the window was semi-lighted, to give a degree of opacity. They may have approximately 20 feet wide and 30 feet high, running the entire length of the starboard side of the ship. The ship then veered slightly clockwise, which I can control flashing, going north-south at a tower height with it's lights in the center line, became more intense, this position seemed to keep pace with the moving car, as if were taken a seated position on the window sill with my arms upon the roof of the car, and looked as it might into the bulb lighted like momentaries for a split second. These lights are very large round electric no or quartz type, likely there are two of these on each side of center line, according into the bottom of the craft. He estimate these lights to be about 10 feet in diameter. The ship then lifted as straight up about 200 feet and hovered some for a minute, then proceeded to take off at a great rate of speed in a southerly direction with not a sound. When it got up to about 500 to 600 feet, it made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the East and rapidly disappeared from sight. The most amazing part of this sighting was that no atmospheric disturbance or sound of any kind accompanied the arrival, hovering or departure of this strange craft. I am not one to get excited over sensational stories, but I am convinced that whit I saw was not a natural phenomenon, I would like to add this, in moving in a southerly direction, it would be going in the direction of a secret military installation, attached to the NAS Cherry Hill, N.J., and played down the fact that such an installation existed to the general public. I would be interested to know if any other sightings of this type have been reported in this area. It was an unforgettable and unbelievable experience to this writer, who regards the phenomena as being of extraterrestrial origin.

extends 20 to 30 feet above the roof. There are several pulsating or blinking lights on the side of the ship. about 5 feet in diameter, some of these lights appear to be circling or circling the ship. The movement or blinking of these lights seems to be controlled or regulated. These appear to be running or blinking lights. The brilliant white light bulb that was visible from the bottom, is only visible or on when the ship is in flight, not while hovering or landing. A thin ray of light appears to be coming from the center of the bottom part of the ship which resembles a searchlight or beam. At times this beam of light appears to be a reaction of the round bottom part of the ship when illuminated by both the lights on the side and bottom. We parked there for about 10 minutes, and then moved to the Cherry Hill Apts. parking lot entrance, and parked there for about 5 mins. and observed the tail or rear of the ship. we might have observed and everybody on the scene at that time noticed that the some light on the nose of the ship was made up from several curved blended, and diffusing to give the appearance to be sending. This light is also made from certain that appears to be sending these light do not blink as one would say a light blink in a sign or a distance plain sight. There are several other witnesses, who saw the dirigible, the same night, and shortly before we saw it at the Irving light.

Mr. & Mrs. [REDACTED]  
Maple Shade, New Jersey 03052
Dear Mr. & Mrs. [REDACTED],
Thank you for your letter of June 15. I have no idea what it was you said you have given no few facts. In the first place, I do not in any sense believe that you saw a dirigible. I do not believe it was any form of a ship. It had nothing whatever to do with Cape Kennedy I am sure. And again I am quite sure that the ship does not come from outer space. My only point in writing you is to try to find out whether indeed you really saw something. And indeed, what kind of stimulus it was that provoked your reaction.
I am well aware of the mythical air ships of 1895-97. And indeed your description fits the recitals that I feel there is definitely some sort of relationship. I have discussed these sightings in books, "Flying saucers" published by the Harvard University Press in 1953, and in "The World of Flying Saucers" by Donald H. Menzel and Lyle G. Boyd, published by Doubleday. The second one is still in print and available at your bookstores. It is second one that may be of greatest interest to you and available in print and available in print.
Your descriptions are too detailed, too pat. If something of this sort had been in the area we should have had hundreds of reports, not just a few. 
We do not know whether the sky was clear or cloudy or many other things. One explanation that occurs to my mind is that a bright searchlight on clouds might have produced something similar to what you reported.
Sincerely yours,
Donald H. Menzel
