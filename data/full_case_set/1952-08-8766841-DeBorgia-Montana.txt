The sane are an apparent "air funnel" or "ring formation" hovering over the road about a mile north of DeBorgia, Montana at approximately 4:00 P.M. MST on August 7, 1952. The ring formed and floated for about five minutes before disappearing. It was grayish-white in color and was quite solid and definite in outline. It was reported to be about 50 feet in diameter and appeared to rotate slowly as it floated. It was not a normal cloud formation.

Than one other person may have seen this occurrence, as it was allegedly seen by several people in the DeBorgia area at that time. 

I was very cautious to observe this phenomenon objectively, as I was not sure if "flying saucers" were real or not. However, after seeing this definite object which did not fit any conventional description, I am now convinced that such things do exist and are worthy of serious investigation.

I came on a business trip to the Bainbridge Island area near Seattle. I went on Friday afternoon July 18, 1952 and came back the next morning, Saturday, July 19. 

The round thing I saw was in a wooded area across the road from where my family and I were camping near DeBorgia, Montana. It came over the trees, turned sideways, and came down to about 300 feet. Then it went up over the trees, turned sideways again and went away.

This thing made not a sound and the night was clear. It was a bright clear night and I could see it very well. I watched it for at least 15 minutes. I was mystified as to what this thing was. It looked like aluminum colored with bright lights, 25 to 30 feet across, shaped like a disk.

I want to emphasize that I am not a nut and have never been a nut. I have a masters degree and consider myself a very rational and stable person. I have never told this to anybody before but felt I should report it because I think the government should know about things like this. It was a strange and unexplainable experience.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten document with text that seems to be part of a UFO report or investigation. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text found in the document:

Favorable winds only and at times a mere

and I was so startled I did not think to
get the time tho I glanced at my watch
at the time. There was no engine noise
what ever or jet stream visible it just appeared to 
be a solid object of some kind gliding at
great speed and at great altitude it did not
appear to be an aircraft of any kind that I 
have ever seen.
