The image does not contain any photograph. The document appears to be a "DISPOSITION FORM" related to a "Request review of UFO reports from Okhotsk area".

FILE NO.: AFOIX-413
SUBJECT (U): Request review of UFO reports from Okhotsk area
FROM: AFOIX-454
DATE: 18 June 1958

The key points in the text are:
1. Attached reports are forwarded for review as possible indications of foreign missile activities.
2. The characteristics, descriptions, and patterns in the reports are those of a "true UFO sighting" as identified.
3. The reason for submitting these is that within two months substantially the same objects, in the same area and within 30 miles of each other were reported by both the Air Force and Navy. A rough plot of the direction or travel indicates the point of origin might be the same, although the direction of travel is in another direction, proceeding on the same assumption.
4. Your comment by reply hereon would be appreciated.
