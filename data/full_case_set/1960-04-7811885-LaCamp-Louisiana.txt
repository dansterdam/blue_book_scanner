Examination and Results:

The material, much of which adhered to the containing envelope, was drained out and subjected to qualitative analysis. The material, which was retrieved from the envelope, was drained out and subjected to qualitative analysis.

Sample #1 (C-1):
The only major element indicated was iron, with a very small trace of chromium.

Sample #2 (C-2):
These appeared to be less than 2 mg. Iron was indicated as the major element; no other elements were detected.

Sample #3 (C-3):
Major amounts of iron, major amounts of chromium were indicated.

Conclusions:
It was concluded, from the analysis, that the dark colored material which appeared to be metallic in nature was found to contain a major amount of iron, and a minor amount of chromium.

STATEMENT

1. On 25 Apr 1959, I was working the shift (23.30-07.15) on the llth of April 1959. I had just turned a C-121 type aircraft out on departure and checked his low equipment, also aiding in the preflight. 

I noticed this A/C out approximately 35 miles and cleared him engines on.

I was sitting at the scope position talking to Tower on the land line for approximately 10 minutes more. I then hung up and was watching the Radar scopes which was set on the 20 mile range with ten mile range marks.

I observed an UIP target coming in from the Northwest at approximately 5 miles out. It appeared the target was moving at a tremendous speed. I immediately called and alerted Tower for a possible radio out aircraft. Tower looked for a/c and reported none. The UIP target came down the extended center line of runway 11 and disappeared in the vortex of the scope for approximately one minute and then I observed target going back out on a heading of 330 degrees. The target when visible indicated speeds I & 3 for positive identification.

I changed my Mode selector to Mode 2 and target disappeared. I then turned my Radar beacon off, and target disappeared. I then switched my selector back to Mode 1 and 3 and turned beacon on again. The target was approximately 6 miles out on 3t5 - outbound. I called New Orleans center for a/c in vicinity of Alexandria and they reported none. I called local GCI site and asked them if they had the target on their weapon. They reported negative, but had BIF target ringing the scope. I kept tracking target until he was 20 miles to the Northwest in which time GCI never reported contact. The target then disappeared from my scopes with a capability of 100 miles radar coverage. I watched the 200 mile secondary scopes and the only target within 200 miles again was approximately 190 miles.

REPORT NO.: 15-4-60  
DATE: 15 APRIL 1960
PAGE: 1 OF 2

This report contains information obtained by interview of persons who claim to have observed an unidentified aerial object. Based on the information provided, evaluation has been made and conclusions drawn. This report is furnished for your information and should be considered in conjunction with other information on this subject which may be available.

The individual who reported the sighting was interviewed. He stated that he could not provide any information regarding the identity of the object sighted since he did not see it clearly enough to determine what it was. He said that he was in a boat fishing at the time of the sighting, which occurred at approximately 8:30 PM on 10 April 1960 in the vicinity of the Gulf of Mexico near the Louisiana coastline. He said that the object was visible for only a few seconds, and he did not have time to make a detailed observation. He said that some "pranks" had occurred in the area recently, and he wondered if this sighting might be related to those incidents, but he could not be certain. He said that the people in the area were still talking about the incident, but that he personally had no additional information to provide.

WHERE INDICATED:
Contracts with persons in the general area have been made. ALL
INDICATED CONTACTS HAVE BEEN INCONCLUSIVE. No further action is contemplated unless additional information, which would justify it, is received.

the having stated that persons in the entire area were concerned that some kind of flying object appeared the skyline over the ority of the area. Various indications reflect that the abject or objects displayed unusual characteristics which create a great deal of interest among the people in the area. An attempt to obtain detailed information from the witnesses concerning their observations was made. However, the witnesses were unwilling to furnish additional information over and above what had already been provided. Interrogation revealed that the witnesses were not willing to discuss the matter further until they had the opportunity to consult with others who had seen the objects. It was ascertained that a closer examination of the alleged object or objects was not possible since they disappeared from view soon after they were first observed.

NO SIGN OF ANY TYPE EQUIPMENT IN THE AREA AT THE

SAID THAT WHAT MUST OF A GET BLACKED OUT FOR ABOUT FIVE (5) SECONDS
AFTER IT PASSED OVER. APPROXIMATELY 150 YARDS FROM THE SOURCE
A HIGH WHINE FOLLOWED BY ABOUT TEN (10) FAST EXPLOSIONS.
SOUNDED LIKE ARTILLERY SHELLS, SINCE THESE
TWO MEN LIVE ON THE BORDER OF FORT POLK RESERVATION, THEY HAVE
MUCH EXPERIENCE IN ARTILLERY SOUNDS, HOWEVER, FORT POLK
DENIES ANY ARTILLERY FIRE IS BEING ACCOMPLISHED. SO
MONROE ARNOLD HAS LITTLE FORMAL EDUCATION BUT IS A KEEN OBSERVER
WITH A PASSION FOR ACCURACY. HIS STORY IS COMMON WITH COUNTRY FOLKS
OF THIS SECTION. HE HAS HAD JATO BOTTLES FALL ON HIS FARM

3. It is suggested that your office instruction (Catch #2) be expanded to include the following:
a. Requirement action for investigators when physical evidence is located -
(1) If the exact location of the landing area is determined to be radioactive, it should be roped off, properly marked, and a guard posted. ALSO, if the object is covered by debris and grass, the site should be left undisturbed. Since precautions are only necessary if the level of radiation is determined to be potentially harmful to personnel.

b. If the position of the object relative to security forces and civilian population is indicative of a possible crash, the area should be secured until chemical and radiological survey personnel arrive.

4. In all instances where it is determined that physical evidence in the environment is present, an intensive analysis all fragments and other material will be made to the fullest extent possible.

OPERATOR'S REPORT RECORD

SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

1. On 30 April 1960, a report of an unidentified flying object sighted in the area of La Camp, Louisiana (02450) LOC) on 25 April 1960. This report was forwarded to ATIC by the Intelligence Division, USAF, England.

2. The object was reported to have been seen by two witnesses. The witnesses stated that the object was a round disc or sphere, apparently about 25-30 feet in diameter, and was observed for approximately three seconds.

3. The investigation of the details of this report revealed evidence that some object had hit the ground at some point within the area, but there was no other confirmation that what the witnesses saw was actually the object that hit the ground. The search of the area, on foot and by helicopter, failed to reveal the object.

4. Investigation of the points of impact revealed evidence that a foreign material had struck the ground, but the investigation further revealed that this was most likely a meteorite impact rather than any man-made or unidentified aerial object.

5. On 21 April 1960, Major Tripp of the Aerial Phenomena Group, ARDC, conducted an interview of the witnesses. This interview was made with the full cooperation of the local Air Force Base, which assisted in the investigation.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Report of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

1. On 13 April 1960, a report of an unidentified flying object sighted in the vicinity of Lake Charles, Louisiana (XXXX XXXX) local on 13 April 1960, was reported to the Air Intelligence Division, LCLD Tr. 

2. The object was reported to have been seen by one witness, in a rural area west of Lake Charles, Louisiana. The witness stated that the object was first sighted in the southwest sky and appeared to be hovering or stationary. The object then moved in a northerly direction and descended to about tree-top level, and then rapidly gained altitude and disappeared from view. The witness stated that the object had flashing lights and that four or five explosions was associated with the sighting.

3. The Wing Intelligence Officer of the LCLD Tr visited the area of the sighting and determined that the object had not been seen by any other persons in the area. An investigation was conducted on foot and by helicopter failed to reveal the object reported.

4. Investigation of the points of impact revealed evidence that a foreign metallic substance had been deposited on the ground. The analysis of this evidence is that the material is inert. (See Atch 1, Point 6, Photo 3) The condition of the ground at the points of impact was undisturbed. (Atch 1, Point 7, Photo 7) Samples of this evidence has been recovered and sent to ATIC.

5. On 21 April 1960, Major Friend of the Aerial Phenomena Section, AMC-AFSF, visited the LCLD Tr. Major Friend was assisted in the investigation by representatives of the intelligence division. Major Friend obtained negative results in his attempt to locate the object reported. No other sightings of the object were reported during the period of his investigation.

A piece of supposed Bark and a Portion of supposed Tree Leaves Collected under cover of darkness 2 Mar 54.

This item was collected at the impact area considered 1/ the possible location of an unidentified Flying Object that crashed 13 April 1954.

Reason for collection and the basic description of the specimen is evidently because the leaves and bark were visually observed in the impact area. This is apparent from the spanish discourse on 4 Incidents related to this possible crash the evidently revealed by the USAF. This is related to AF Form 112 missing because the leaves and bark have already been shipped to rear area for analysis. It is not known if the analysis revealed anything significant.
