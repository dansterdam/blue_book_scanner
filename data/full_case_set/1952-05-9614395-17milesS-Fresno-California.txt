A sighting took place at about 9:00 p.m. on May 9, 1952, 17 miles south of Fresno, California. The report states there were unusual lights in the sky which did not conform to normal aircraft lights. The lights reportedly maneuvered in an unusual manner, making sharp turns and accelerating rapidly. The lights were observed for approximately 10 minutes before disappearing.

The observer, who was a civilian, reported the incident to the nearest Air Force base, and this sighting was subsequently investigated. The report indicates that the investigator was unable to determine the nature of the unidentified lights observed. The case was classified as "Unknown" in the project Blue Book files.
