A. CERTAIN
B. FAIRLY CERTAIN
C. NOT VERY SURE
D. UNCERTAIN 

23. HOW DID THE OBJECT OR OBJECTS DISAPPEAR FROM VIEW? AFTER LISTENING UP (CASE BELOW) FOR 3RD. LINES DISAPPEARED TO START TO PORT BEHIND A DISTANT CLOUD, THEN GONE. 

24. WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT SOMEONE ELSE DO AFTER SEEING A PICTURE OR A SIGHTING SUCH AS THIS?  WE WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO IMAGINE THAT YOU COULD CONSTRUCT THE OBJECT THAT YOU SAW.  WHAT MATERIAL WOULD YOU USE TO MAKE IT?  HOW LARGE WOULD IT BE, AND WHAT SHAPE WOULD IT HAVE?

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF WHAT I HAD: I HELD IN MY HAND A KEUFFEL AND ESSER HALF-CIRCLE PROTRACTOR.  NEAR THAT, I TRIED TO CONSTRUCT BY SIGHT A HUGE QUESTION MARK, BUT IT WAS TOTALLY INADEQUATE TO THE TASK.  IT WOULD TAKE A HUGE GEODESIC DOME TAPERING TO A POINT, BUT THAT TOO WAS INADEQUATE.  I'M CERTAIN IT WAS VERY MUCH LARGER THAN ANYTHING I COULD EVER CONSTRUCT. (THIS SOUNDS QUITE INSANE, BUT THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED.)

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet summarizing an incident that occurred on June 19, 1953. The text provides details about a "skiff" or small boat that was sitting in a storm off the Bahia Honda, Florida area and observed strange lights and phenomena in the sky and water.

Text transcription from the document:

U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)

On June 19, 1953, at 1913, EST, a skiff was sitting in a storm of 40-knot winds and close to anchor on the Bahia Honda, Florida area., 24°44' North Latitude, 81°23' West Longitude. The skiff's operator, , observed a strange light descending at a 45-degree angle at a speed estimated to be about 1000 mph. The light remained stationary approximately 30 seconds, then shot straight up at a speed estimated to be approximately 1500 mph. The skiff's operator stated that the light was about the size of a half-moon and was a greenish-white color, with a greenish-yellow trail. After about 2 seconds, the light went off for about 2 seconds, then illuminated again for 3 seconds, made a 90-degree turn, and disappeared behind a cloud bank.

There were no ships or anything showing in the stream, and not even a ripple. There was no noise of any kind, and indeed, no skiff in any place near us. There was no moonlight. The night was partly cloudy. The sea was running more or less due east, and a light breeze approximately 10 mph was blowing from the WNW. The light was observed through 7 x 50 binoculars. Estimated height, 8000 ft. The size was similar to that of a half-moon. At the end of the maneuver, the scene was illuminated for approximately 2 more seconds and then became dark.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document or report related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text on the page describes the witness's account of observing a strange object in the sky and provides details about the object's movement, altitude, and other characteristics. The witness expresses uncertainty about the nature of the object and cautions that their recollection may not be entirely accurate. The text also mentions the formation of the object, which is described as a "round half-moon that was brightly lighted, but there did appear to be a dim, half-after-part - triangular in shape, attached to the base of the main formation."

USAPTIS
I was able to follow the path of the object somehow, even when it was not luminous; and knew exactly where it should emerge. The distance that the object ran during the some 13 seconds we had it in view was approximately 11 nautical miles. My reason for stressing the cloud bank formation and its distance is that it is by means of this that I am definitely sure as to the true size of the object.
When the object had an altitude of about 300, and my recollection is that it disappeared, its altitude was approximately 10°. This would indicate that the object was very large. If my recollection is correct, it would give a clue to the height or the object when at its maximum altitude.
(1) That the object was abnormally silent, so silent in fact that I was conscious of my own hearing or lack of it. 
(2) That I misjudged the run of the object before it disappeared, believing it to be impossible as its disappearance seemed completefy fantastic). 
(3) That the object gained altitude on the run (this latter, in my opinion).
To me the most striking feature of the fantastic episode was not the obvious fact that something out of the ordinary had occurred, but rather the impression that all three of us who witnessed the disappearance of the object were absolutely certain that "Jesus Christ, what's that?!"
It is my opinion that Captain ___ and I both saw the object simultaneously and that when I did. The three of us were able to follow it during the entire run.
The formation, as mentioned above, was that of a round half-moon that was brightly lighted, but there did appear to be a dim, half-after-part - triangular in shape, attached to the base of the main formation.
I have heard, but do not know of my own knowledge, that the object was picked up on Key West radar.
Respectfully submitted,

23 June 1953

Statement of Ral Mathias EUNG, Chief Radio Electrician, U.S. Navy, attached to Fleet Tactical Support Squadron, VU-6, U.S. Naval Air Station, Key West, Florida, who resides at 1215 Patterson Avenue, Key West, Florida.

This is my detailed account of a strange object observed in the sky on the 18th past, at about 1930. It was a clear night, according to my observation, and while I was looking skyward, I observed a very bright light moving at a rapid rate of speed from west to east. The light appeared to be oscillating or vibrating and this oscillation seemed to become less as the light approached its zenith. The light seemed to focus upon us and well, seeming to attract my attention by its brilliance. It assumed the appearance of an unusually bright star. This light was very intense, whiter than the planet Venus and it remained in view for about 5 or 6 minutes.

After two or three minutes, another light, similar in appearance, arrived from the west at the same rate of speed and this second light appeared to orbit or circle the first light. The two lights then proceeded in an easterly direction until they disappeared from view. The motions of these two lights resembled nothing I had ever observed before. The oscillating or vibrating motion, the fact that they appeared to focus upon us, and the fact that one appeared to orbit the other are very unusual phenomena. The oscillating light seemed to increase and diminish in intensity during the time it was observed. It seemed to be propelled under its own power as it showed no signs of being a lighted aircraft as we know them, nor did it show any trail like a jet or conventional aircraft.

This light then was recalled to several direction and their was much speculation as to what it might be. It was estimated that the light or lights were approximately 80 to 90 miles distant from our location on Big Spanish Key. This light then traveled several miles in approximately 10 seconds, a speed far in excess of any jet or conventional aircraft. The light or lights showed no signs of being an aircraft, no sound was heard, nor were any exhaust trails noted. The light did not flicker or blink as do conventional aircraft lights. In manner and continued in a very steady and direct motion for the entire time they were under observation. I am familiar with the many types of aircraft, both military and civilian, and this display of lights was unlike any I have ever observed before. The lack of any trail or sound, the extremely rapid rate of speed, and the steady and direct motion of the lights, the oscillating or vibrating effect, and the fact that one light appeared to orbit another are very unusual phenomena. This is the most incredible and strange manifestation of lights I have ever witnessed.

The image does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a page from a typed document or report. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

Flight condition was right at dusk, around 1900. In this area it was still light enough to see most things. The objects looked to be about the size of a good many stars. There were 5 or 6 of them, some closer in the sky. As a matter of fact the other object as they were going off seemed to be in the sky. As I was watching the objects they seemed to be traveling in a straight line, behind each other, one following the other. The time of day is was, just before the stars came out. I have observed many aircraft at this time of day and these objects did not behave like any aircraft I have ever seen. They were traveling very, very bright light. It was a very bright light which seemed to be directed or focused on a spot. The objects would come to one spot and then it would come on another spot as if they were trying to light up a certain area. What they were doing I do not know, but it was something I have never seen before. The objects appeared to be about the size of stars, but much brighter. As near as I could see and from where I was, it would be between 15 and 20 miles due south of here.
I should say within 20 miles. Not closer than 20 miles. Well, it was closer than 20 but not as close as 15 miles. How close, I was not able to determine. However, I was not able to determine the exact location, but I know they were over 15 miles and not closer than 20 miles. Now on the size, the objects were about the size of stars, but much brighter. As I recall any size which is about the size of the largest star, a bright star.
I was observed of this daily, for a period of 15 days, continued every night and day, a total of 15 days and 2 months and 28 days naval service.

AIR FORCE FORM 112—PART II
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1951

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT UNCLASSIFIED

FROM: (AGENCY) 8th Intelligence Section

TO: Commanding General, Air Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Incident at Key West, Florida, 25 March 1953

A final "Top Secret" security clearance dated 25 March 1953, given to the Commanding Officer, U.S. Naval Air Station, Key West, Florida, was in connection with the interrogation of the pilot and observation of the incident. The interrogation lasted approximately two and one-half hours during which time the pilot submitted a written statement of the incident.

The pilot stated that the object was observed in the sky above him at approximately 4,000 feet for a period of ten to twelve minutes. The object was described as appearing to be metallic in nature, round in shape, and was estimated to be approximately 50-60 feet in diameter. The object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and at one point came to a complete stop and then accelerated rapidly, making an abrupt change in direction of flight. The pilot believed the object was not an aircraft or any known type of missile.

No unusual meteorological conditions were noted during this period. There were thunderstorms in the area and it was raining, but the object was observed clearly through breaks in the clouds at 22,000 feet and below broken clouds at 10,000 feet.

No physical evidence of the sighting was found. No flights were conducted in the area close to the time of the sighting.

1. Observer and his wife did not return to Key West until 20 June and, since he
was on leave at the time, he did not report the incident until this date. According to
his statement, the sighting was reported to the base legal officer at the time it
occurred. This was approximately 2230 hours 19 June 1953, when the observer and his
wife observed an unidentified object at approximately 2,000 feet altitude hovering
in the air and the base legal officer was immediately notified. The object departed
in a north-northwesterly direction at a very fast speed, leaving no visible trail.
2. An interview was arranged at Key West on 1 July and it was decided that due to the
lack of any additional information or details to substantiate the observer's report,
this case could not be satisfactorily explained and must be classified as an
UNIDENTIFIED.

JOINT MESSAGEFORM
FROM: AFOIN-ATIA-7-16-E  UNCLASSIFIED
ATIC has received AF Form 112 on 16 June 53 Key West sighting by WO Paul M. Laino. Request you determine whether T/2N aircraft specified in report was operating searchlights at the time of sighting. Also request you determine whether other local aircraft noted were engaged in any unusual lighting operations. ATIC believes five second duration of sighting does not allow observer accurate estimate of object's course. T/2N therefore may have headed toward him then flew away and therefore could have caused sighting. ATIC regards your report as officially complete.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a document titled "FLYOBRT, Larne" regarding an incident at the U.S. Naval Base in Key West, Florida on June 20, 1953.

The text of the document is as follows:

U.S. NAVAL BASE
KEY WEST, FLORIDA

From: Commander, U.S. Naval Base, Key West, Florida
To: Headquarters, 456th Troop Carrier Wing (H)
Ref: (a) Hq. 456th Troop Carrier Wing (H) RID ltr to CO NAVBASE
Key West, Fla. of 20 JUL 1953

1. The information stated in the third paragraph of reference (a) has been checked with the Commanding Officer at the Naval Air Station and it has been determined that there were no aircraft in the air during the time indicated. The pilot departure from the area was at 2330 on 19 JUN 1953, this being the only flight activity at that time.

2. We were unable to determine that any aircraft with searchlights were in the air in the Key West area at any time close to the time of the reported sighting.

3. The information you have on the two local flights was apparently obtained from a misdocumented flight schedule of Air Develoment Squad-ron ONE. These two flights were cancelled prior to the scheduled time of departure.

25 February 1954

Mr. [redacted]
New York 21, New York

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Because of our geographical proximity to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, the Air Technical Intelligence Center and its control station at Orlando, we frequently receive from ATIC reports of unidentified flying objects which indicate, from the initial data recorded from the observers, that an astronomical or meteorological interpretation of the phenomenon may be in order.

We have received your report of the phenomenon witnessed last 19 June near Key West, Florida, and we were particularly impressed with the fine job done, both in observing and in reporting.

A few additional questions come to mind which, we feel, might help us clear up the incident.

I shall be in New York some time this week, and would appreciate the opportunity of discussing this with you personally, since this is somewhat of a problem which would be willing to contribute her report as well.

I trust you will find it convenient to cooperate with us in this matter. I shall probably contact you Wednesday morning.

Very truly yours,

J. R. Gluck
Astrophysicist

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this document. It appears to be a typed page from a Project Blue Book report, containing text describing an investigation of observations made on June 19, 1953 in Key West, Florida.

Summary of Investigation of Observations, 19 June 1953, Key West, Fla.

Interrogated Mr. & Mrs. They talked a great deal, not waiting for questions to be put to them.

Mr. X, a deliberatelyBrcareless, highly sophisticated individual of 54, was extremely close-mouthed. He considered himself full-length upon the couch and pouring himself out, not less than 5 minutes, giving himself the opinion of observers; in fact, he states he can see stars in the daytime. As he reached over to reach his flas who could not believe him. The character of the observers is, I believe, relevant to the interpretation of the observations.

The observers reconstructed the incident; namely, that they, along with a medico-lfitimatey, had been fishing off Key West. 19 June 53. The time was at twilight, everything was still, no clouds at all, except suddenly, a dull, aluminum-colored object appeared in the sky. He studied it for a few seconds and said, "It's a disk out of range". He watched it slowly disappear in the direction of the north.

It descended to an estimated altitude of 12-14,000 feet, the speed would have been 3,400 mph and the rise of the object 600 feet.

Evaluation:
1. The incident took place within 2 minutes of sunset.
2. We can saw the moon at the same time. However, on 19 June, the moon was at 1st quarter, putting it near the meridian at sunset - almost exactly the complement of the described orientation: that the moon was not a factor.

Now, how could anyone be able to see Polaris, a 2nd magnitude star, in very bright twilight, and yet fail to see a quarter moon, which, as they had been facing south, must have been looking them square in the face?
