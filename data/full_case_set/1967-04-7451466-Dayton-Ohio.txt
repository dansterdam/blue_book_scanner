27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

The image does not contain any photograph or visual depiction. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report document. The text on the page consists of questions and instructions related to an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting, including questions about the object's movement and appearance, as well as a request to draw a picture showing the shape and direction of the object. The filename indicates this is page 48 of the document "1967-04-7451466-Dayton-Ohio.pdf".

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object did not disappear while the witness was watching it. The witness describes the object as maneuvering in various ways, but does not indicate that it disappeared.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
According to the document, the witness answered "Yes" to the question "Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?". The document then instructs the witness to "IF you answered YES, then tell what" was behind the object.

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
The witness answered "Yes" to the question "Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?". The document then instructs the witness to "IF you answered YES, then tell what" was in front of the object.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Silent and no sounds
b. Color: Red, orange and white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The witness provides a detailed description of their attempt to measure the angular size of the object using a match stick held at arm's length. They state that the object would have been "approximately 10 degrees" covered by the match head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
No drawing or sketch is included in the document. The section labeled "19." is left blank.

26. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
The object I saw was oval-shaped and metallic in appearance. It seemed to be hovering silently in the sky, changing direction and speed without any visible means of propulsion. It was quite large and appeared to be solid, with no discernible openings or appendages. The object emitted a faint glow or halo around its edges, but there were no lights or markings that I could make out. It was a very strange and puzzling sight that I have never encountered before or since.

The image contains a sketch and a compass diagram, but no photograph. 

The text from the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "B" on the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw the object. Place a "B" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "D" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

I am quite certain that what I saw was not a natural phenomena that is, some astronomical object or conventional aircraft. From the manner in which it moved, hovering slowly at times and then rapidly accelerating and disappearing from sight, I feel certain it was some type of unconventional or unconventional craft of an unknown nature. I have never seen anything like this before although I have observed many airplanes, etc., in the sky. It was unlike anything I have ever seen.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram with instructions for observers to follow. The diagram includes a horizon line, an object in the sky, and a compass rose. The instructions ask the observer to imagine the object's position relative to the horizon and to mark its location on the compass.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "X" on the curves' line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you last saw the object.

23. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
