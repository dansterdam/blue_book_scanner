Case 212, Twin Falls, Idaho, Sept. 7, 1956—Said the Idaho Falls Post Register: "A Twin Falls attorney reported that a flying saucer swooped down on his ranch 40 miles south of here when I saw a strange object about 200 feet in diameter flying over. It had a whirling effect on top and gave off a glow. It came in fast overhead and swooped to the ground near a spot where a 400-pound whitefaced steer was standing. The object sped off like a streak of light and the steer was gone." Rayburn reported this story to the sheriff's office: "I was at my ranch about 40 miles south of here when I saw a strange object about 200 feet in diameter flying over. It had a whirling effect on top and gave off a glow. It came in fast overhead and swooped to the ground near a spot where a 400-pound whitefaced steer was standing. The object sped off like a streak of light and the steer was gone." Rayburn said two employees on the ranch, Joe and Dick Farley, also saw the object, and the employees found the remains of the steer.

FLAMING RED SAUCER

Saints Preserve Us, I Had It In Me Mits, Then Poof!

MONEYMORE, Northern Ireland, Sept. 8.--An Irishman named Thomas Hutchinson reported he saw and captured a flaming red flying saucer-- but it got away.
"I had difficulty in holding it down," he explained.
Just as the incident happened this way: He was sitting at home with his wife Maud about noon yesterday when an object dropped from the sky and hit the ground in the middle of a bog 200 yards from his home.
Hutchinson said he hurried to the bog and found the object lying motionless. "It was bright red," said Mr. Hutchinson, "and it must have been about three feet high and 18 inches in diameter."
He put a hammer lock on the thing but it was pretty powerful and "it kicked me over," said the Irishman. "That is returned to the original position."
When he got down on his hands and knees to capture the baffling object, "it shot up suddenly and disappeared into the sky," he said.
He put a hammer lock on it but it was pretty powerful and "it kicked me over," said the Irishman. "That is returned to the original position."
When he got down on his hands and knees to capture the baffling object, "it shot up suddenly and disappeared into the sky," he said.
The police at Lotp, Hutchinson had to get through a thick hedge, "down for a moment," he said, "and what do you think? It started spinning again."
Before he had time to throw himself on the queer colored invader again, it disappeared into the rain-laden clouds.
The cops at Lotp called the Royal Air Force station at nearby for help, but the commander said the object did not belong to the R.A.F. When the Royal Air Force officer arrived, "he did not believe me," said Hutchinson. "I would not even hazard a guess" as to what the object might have been.

The image contains a newspaper clipping with a photograph depicting a "flying saucer" that was allegedly seen by a man named Thomas J. Hutchinson in Moneymore, Northern Ireland. The article describes how Hutchinson was unable to hold onto the saucer-shaped object as it quickly flew away. 

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

COULDN'T HOLD IT-SO FLYIN' SAUCER GOT AWAY!
MONEYMOEE, Northern Ireland, Se pt. 6. - ( A P ) - - - Farmer Thomas J. Hutchinson named a saucer-shaped object as the only dry piece of ground in his midedle of a bog pond--but police preferred the farmer's version.
He had difficulty in holding it down, savs Hutchinson, a Royal Air Force officer said when questioned. Hutchinson said he and his wife spotted the object hovering about three feet high and is inches in diameter.
It started to rise quickly and disappeared into the clouds, he said. Hutchinson said he tried to hold it down but it managed to break away.
The Hutchinson farm is located in a long hand-rent area. "In the south of the country do wn where I live," said Hutchinson, "a saucer-shaped object is really something."
THOMAS HUTCHINSON IS NOT taking this thing lightly," he said. "We plainly saw it, but police preferred the farner's version."
THE HUTCHINSONS WATCHED THE object for a few moments. "Then the man kicked it over," said the Irishman. "But it returned to its original position."
When he got down on his hands and knees to examine the object more closely it started to rise again.
"He put a harness back on the same object, but it was pretty hopeless," added Hutchinson. "The odd thing was that it was the only place in the middle of a boggy field where the ground was dry." 
But on the way to the village of Bangor, it is thought he had to get busy again.
"I put the saucer down for a moment," he said, "and it started spinning again." 
Before he had time to throw himself on the queer colored invader it rose quickly and disappeared into the clouds.
The case is now being investigated by the Royal Air Force station at nearby Aldergrove.
The commander and the Royal Air Force sergeant who questioned Hutchinson said the official opinion was that he would not even hazard a guess at what he had seen.

Florence, Kentucky

Case 216, Florence, Ky., Sept. 9 1956--Jack Juell and two witnesses while driving in a field observed an "extremely bright light in the sky, the nature of which was identified as an aircraft". Following the light, the witnesses watched the strange light and to their surprise, when the aircraft circled, the light was lowered--then with a burst of speed shot upwards to a great height, easily identified, and disappeared. But, to the astonishment of everyone, it came into view again, followed by a mysterious light during which the plane, on a straight course, this incident while the plane was suddenly accelerating, cut off to the west, the UFO suddenly accelerating, made a circle, the unknown pursued and disappeared. Said Juell, "The most unusual thing I've ever seen."

And another Texas paper, the Fort Worth Sunday News, in September, 1956 by Officer William Van Dyke of the Idaho State Police, at Severill, Idaho (on the Utah border). It shows two distinct disc-shaped objects, according to reports, they were taken over a spot where an automobile accident had taken place at the same time. The victims of the accident told State Police that they had encountered the peculiar white substance, and an investigation was supposed to have been made. (We are checking this and hope to report more fully later.)

Norwood, Ohio

Case 208, Norwood, Ohio, Sept. 3, 1956 - Eugene Kingman, a radio operator in the Air Force during World War II, was coming down a ladder outside his home. Looking up he saw the sun and to his surprise, another object, bluish white, came into view and passed near the same object. With Kingman were two other observers, one a former skeptic of saucers. Together they watched the bluish white objects. These were joined in a triangular formation - the two in rear less intense in luminosity than the leader and according to Kingman, "appeared to be larger than the others." After an immeasurable minutes stranger passed by and joined in watching the spectacle and immediately pointed out two more luminous objects, looking like primitive battle. Said Kingman, "the outstanding feature about these two objects was the 'streak of lightning' which seemed to connect them in their flight. The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes, during which time, no sound was heard."

1956,Sept.3--Whenupai,New Zealand-6:42 p.m.--A glowing UFO with a white "haze" flashed across the sky as a Squadron-Leader was landing his hastings-aircraft.Another Pilot saw it,too.
The report states that the witnesses saw an object with "about four windows in the side" traveling west across the harbor from Devonport. They said it was cigar-shaped with blue flame shooting from the rear. Observers mostly agreed the object was flying very low, maybe only 500 feet high, and made no sound. It gave off a reddish or pinkish glow. Everyone agreed that it was flying straight and level.
One of the witnesses, a farmer of Kaponga, near New Plymouth, estimated the object to be 70 feet long, 30 feet wide, and to be flying at around 500 feet. He said it passed over his farm about 1,000 ft. Mr. McIntosh, president of the Auckland Astronomical Society, said he knew the witness and found him "obviously a meteor."
