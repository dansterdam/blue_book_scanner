The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed memo. The memo discusses reports of UFO sightings that were received by the Air Sciences Division. It provides details about the sightings, including the time, location, direction, and appearance of the UFO. The memo also requests that the recipient provide their comments and calculations related to the sightings.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Captain Mixter - AGIN-4/31
SUBJECT: General Orbital-Track Checks for Air Sciences Division.

1. This office has received a number of UFO reports from COG points in the Etain AEB, France, describing the sightings and Minneapolis areas. A cursory check discloses that these are primarily stuffed with high school students or vocational school boys, this time or their hands. Their reliability is obvious. However, would appreciate if a check for stability could be made on the hand of the following observed in that area:

a. Time: Between 2130 to 2140 hours (local).
b. Date: 12 July 1958.
c. General direction: SSW to ENE.
d. UFO appearance: Very small, white and round.

2. Just received UFO reports from Air Attache, France - there were four military observers - basic data:

a. Place: NE France (50 N - 4 E).
b. Time: 2137 Z (GMT for that area considered C. Therefore, local time seems):
c. Date: 11 July 1958.
d. General direction: 190 - 190 degrees to 4-30 degrees.
e. Appearance: Round, white. In sight approximately one minute.

3. Your comments and results of your computations may be hand written directly on this memorandum. Would appreciate it if you would give us a call.

Text from the document:

Comment re sighting No. 1
Date: 12 July 1958 
Hour: 0230 - 0240 local
Place: Area near Greenway, Wise.

Over Lake Huron at 123 miles altitude, a Sputnik III rocket was seen at 0240 h on 12 July 1958. Using general observation point of 45 degrees N - 90 degrees W, the satellite (1958 Alpha 2) of Sputnik III followed the rocket portion by about 8 minutes at this particular time. It's orbit was about 115 miles to the east of the rocket but it is visually much brighter and larger and remained in view for about half or lower visible time. This case of Sputnik III, although a direct reflection of motion is considered to have been condition of sighting sufficient to clear off the eastern horizon to be seen in the area described. 

Comment re sighting No. 2
Date: 11 July 1958
Time: 2127 Z 
Place: NE France (50 N 4 E)

1958 Ar (rocket) should have been in the vicinity of the sighting at 2127 Z on 11 July at an altitude of 165 miles traveling in a direction of 25 degrees.
