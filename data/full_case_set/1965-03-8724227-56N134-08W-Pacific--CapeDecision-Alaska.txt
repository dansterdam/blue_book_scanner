DATE - TIME GROUP: 5 Dec 1964
LOCATION: 56N134-08W-Pacific--CapeDecision, Alaska
CONCLUSION: DEFINITELY A PROBABLE AIRCRAFT IN DISTRESS BASED ON TIME, DURATION, MANEUVERABILITY, AND PROXIMITY TO CAPE DECISION, ALASKA
BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: Extremely bright light, approximately 20,000 feet, initially stationary, then moved slowly SW, then rapidly NE. Maneuverability and duration of 8-10 minutes indicate it was probably an aircraft in distress rather than a UFO.
