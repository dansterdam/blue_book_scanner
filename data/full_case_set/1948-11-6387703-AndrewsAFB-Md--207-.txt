Incident 207-3

Statement of S/Sgt John J. Kushner corroborates account of 2d Lt 
Kenwood N. Jackeon and 2d Lt Henry G. Combs. Sgt Kushner was on
ground duty when he heard a noise. Turning his head in the direction 
of the sound, he saw a shining object coming across the sky. It 
made a sound similar to a P-47 only twice as loud. It seemed to
him to be coming from the direction of the 2239th Engineering Hangar 
across the field toward Hanger #1. It wasn't very high. It couldn't 
have been a P-47 and witness did not see an exhaust. Shortly after-
wards, he heard the same noise only higher up over the field. He 
stated the object did not resemble an aircraft.

Incident 207

Object first sighted at approximately 2145 18 Nov 48, it was flying from northeast to southwest across Andrews field at 1700 feet. Plane then descended from 4,000 ft to same altitude as object which was then coming back across Andrews Field from the Southwest on a Northeast heading. Object and plane then flew in circles, object on outer circle, Plane followed it to 700 ft. As plane descended plane made 3 to 4 passes at the object to identify it. While climbing plane approximately 270^0 position, object would then climb vertically, drop below plane from behind and continue circling the field. In a last effort the plane switched on a landing light and the object momentarily gave off a dull glow. It appeared oval with no wings and no tail surfaces. After the object was sighted in the landing light, it headed to the Northeast climbing rapidly. Plane lost sight of object at 9,000 ft; the time was then 22:03

Weather at the time: CATU – no clouds, haze or smoke.

Taken from signed statement of Kenwood W. Jackson, 2d Lt., AFRes., AO-941113

Statement corroborated by Glen L. Stalker, 2nd Lt., USAFR,

Incident: 207A

At approximately 2200 hours Lt Henry G. Coombs sighted an object flying on a
360/70 pattern to East over Andrews AF Base. The object had one continuous 
glowing white light. Coombs thought it was an aircraft with the wing
navigation lights turned off or burned out. He then made a pass to check.
Object then took evasive action. First contact established at 1700 feet
over Andrews AF Base. When object started taking evasive action, Combs
switched wing and tail navigation lights off. Maneuvering his ship so
that his exhaust flame would not be noticed in an effort to get the object
on his left he proceeded to close in but the object quickly flew up and over 
his aircraft. Then Combs attempted to maneuver the object between his ship 
and the light of the moon. This was done by maneuvering very tight 360 turns with flaps down while making a steady climb. Object was able to make
turn inside of Combs' aircraft even under this condition. Another amazing
feature was the quick variation of airspeed from 0 MPH to 500 or 600 MPH
Combs remained in contact with the object for some 10 minutes with the 
object between the lights of Washington, D. C. and his aircraft. He could
only see on oblong ball with one light and no wings and no exhaust flame.
Trying to close in again he remained in sight of it up to 6000 feet, then
down to 3500 feet to 4000 feet but it always easily evaded him. When
object and Combs finally climbed up to 7500 feet, Combs pulled back up sharply
and came underneath the object within 500 ft to 1000 ft. He then turned
his landing lights on it. It had a very dull gray glow to it and was oblong
in shape as mentioned before. Object then performed a very tight curve and
headed for the East coast at about 500 to 600 MPH.

Witnesses agree that (1) Object was highly maneuverable,
                  (2) Seemed aware of the presence of a following aircraft
                  (3) Capable of almost vertical flight
                  (4) Was smaller in size that [than] F-6F type aircraft.

Witnesses were uncertain as to whether source of light observed eminated
from entire object or was exhaust type in nature.

5.  Usual hobbies, such as sports, modeling, and events in aviation, were
    admitted by all observers.

6.  Since all personnel stated as observers of object in question have had
    experience as crew members or pilots of aircraft within the last three
    years or more qualified to eliminate good details in relation to
    airborne objects is considered above normal.


7.  Reliability: Source, A2 records and available 202 Magazine Personnel
    and other Files.

    Through investigation of current and available military
    records of subject observers, reliability is considered good since no
    unfavorable comments, entries, etc were revealed.

8. Objects sighted from airborne aircraft in limited traffic position
    by same observers, all claims to have sighted or chased objects were
    grounded. Attention was possible to observe phenomena through
    duration of long motion lighted object - Therefore objects were strange that
    moved advanced aviation.

9. None

10. All observers of object in question are considered to be of average or
    above intelligence, None of the observers illustrated any peculiar
    inclination to auto suggestion since all the circumstances; rather have realised
    to this treated producing every detail and omitting major details unless
    it is believed that sound generated by round object can be attributed to
    sound omitted by ultra high speed jet, as indicated by calculation of other
    observers. Each observer was convinced that what he saw or heard was the
    same as far as he was concerned. Each as available information to sub-
    stance can be determined on which to base any question as to the final dis-
    position and or rate and present conveyance.

The document image appears to contain two photographs. The first photograph, situated towards the upper portion of the document, seems to depict an aerial object that is small and distant, thus its details are not clear. The second image, towards the bottom of the document, looks like a blurred, elongated smudge or smear, which is difficult to identify or describe due to its indistinct nature.

The document contains strings of numbers, letters, and symbols, arranged in blocks, possibly corresponding to codes or shorthand used for recording observations or data. It is unclear without context what these codes represent. The information seems to be of technical nature and may relate to observations, measurements, or reports, as one might find in a historical military or project document. The handwriting appears to identify the document as page number 23.

- page 17 -

There are no photographs present in the image provided. It appears to be a page full of numbers and some text. However, the text is mostly illegible due to the low resolution and quality of the image. I would attempt to transcribe it, but the text clarity does not allow for a confident transcription of the entire content. The only discernible numbers at the bottom are "36" which is likely the page number. If a clearer image is provided, I may be able to offer a transcription.

The image depicts a page with multiple lines of what appear to be alphanumerical codes or data entries in rows. There is no photograph present on this page, only text.

The image you provided is a scanned document that does not contain any photographs, only text that appears to be part of a tabulated data set or report. Due to the nature of the document, it is filled with alphanumeric characters arranged in rows that seem to be codes, timestamps, or other numerical data. The text is not very clear, so interpreting the specific content accurately is challenging.

Here is the text from the document as best as I can interpret:

The rest of the text appears to be more of the same, with alphanumeric codes and references that might be related to navigational data, timestamps, and possibly error codes or warnings.

Since the document contains more rows and columns of similar data, the entire text cannot be transcribed accurately due to lack of clarity. Some annotations are present, such as "---MAINTAIN---" and "MAGISTRATE", and some handwritten notes or signatures. There is some more handwritten text on the bottom-right corner, including underlined numbers and a circled number "1", but this is not clearly legible.

To provide a complete text transcription, a higher-quality image of the document would be needed, as the existing quality and the nature of the content within the document make it challenging to ensure accuracy for every line of text.

Incident No. 207 -- 16 Nov. 1948, 2200 hours, Andrews Air Force
Base, Maryland.
The pilot of a F-6 reported seeing an object over the base at 1700 feet.
Object was an oblong ball with one light, no wings, no exhaust, in land-
ing light of F-6. It had a dull gray glow and was thought to be smaller
than the F-6. Pilot made passes and object evaded by going above air-
craft. F-6 tried to close in very tight climbing turns, but object
turned inside the aircraft. Object was lost after ten minutes at 7500
feet. Its speed seemed to vary between 40 MPH and 600 MPH.

AIC Opinion: That the object described was a symptotic balloon.
Dr. FITE's report shows that it is very difficult for the observer to
separate target motion and his own motion even in daylight, and prac-
tically impossible to do so at night. This fact has been substantiated
by the writer, who in controlled experiments attacked ordinary balloons
with a T-6--in daylight, and with knowledge of what the object was and
what it did, all the above described maneuvers were duplicated in ap-
pearages.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #207, a, b, c -- Andrews Air Base, Camp Springs, Maryland---
18 November 1948

There is no astronomical explanation for the objects observed
in this incident.

The similarity of this incident to #172 is striking, and it
suggests a common origin for the objects. The two incidents were sepa-
rated by a month and a half and by half a continent. The hours of ob-
servation were about the same. It may be significant that ground ob-
servers in each incident did not report the evasive tactics described
by air observers, and it is tempting to hazard the guess that such tac-
tics were largely the result of relative motion. It should be inves-
tigated whether a lighted balloon caught in the prop wash could give
the appearance of a rapidly-manoeuvring aircraft. In fact, this inves-
tigator believes that it would be an interesting experiment to have a
typical lighted balloon paced by aircraft at night, with a competent
observer along to record apparent relative tactics of the balloon.

(It is not clear whether the two observers in this incident
who reported evasive tactics were in the same plane, or not, but it is
presumed that they were.)

      Air Material Command
      Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
      Dayton, Ohio
      ATTN: AC/INLO-X
      
  1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, MCIAAIS,
  dated 19 March 1949, subject “Unidentified Flying Objects,” and files
  indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.
  
  2. The incident summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
  against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
  and Weather Bureau, and based on this review are inclosed.
  
  3. It is recommended that the “Guide to Investigation Of Un-
  identified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows: Item Do, “Direction
  of Flight of Object,” should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
  zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is
  specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
  “Relative to Radar Sighting” should include a statement of the type of
  radar set used.

18 NOV 4P

With 703b indications thus eliminated, there remain thirty-four
which contain some evidence but have no apparent ready explanation. This statement is true only under the assumption that the evidence is 
considered as reliable and accurate. When psychological, and physio-
logical factors are taken into consideration, all of these 
might and invariably are, accounted for by General AAF Weather 
Service in Weather Command norms in the SWORM (5211 and 5031).

(Investigation and analytical methods by Weather 
Services concluded)

There are sufficient psychological explanations for the 
majority of these upsets to provide plausible contradiction - 
psychological origins explain these phenomena in distracting 
attention results chiefly from inability to establish speed, distance, 
size. 

All of the remaining 34 incidents are resolved in detail in the
report, Chapter 4, in this form: No pattern is found in the 34
types of objects or lights for all the experienced aeronauts are 
witness evidence reports were overlooked by the earlier project 
reports or the incidents were completely individual or sporadic 
and not following:

Products Group
3 Survey of CIO Realizables of Remaining Reports

(VI. Summary of All Evaluation of "Tentative Remainder")

The remaining unexplained incidents (see Appendix F) are 
so current characteristics so widely various statements of the more 
than 1000 weather responses were just not read out of place.

(incident incidents No. 77). Most remain unresolved without pattern
throughout the United States. A few more outside the U.S. No two
descriptions or appearance or performance were exactly alike. The re-
ported sightings occurred at various times of day and years.

In the following section of this report, each remaining unidentified
incident is considered separately. It is not the intent to generally
disprove character as observers; in each case is undisputable discrets as
they may be viewed. The present dispensation is merely the same 
as for this incident in the project files.
