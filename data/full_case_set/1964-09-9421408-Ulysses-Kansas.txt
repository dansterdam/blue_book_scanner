CAME AT THE APPROXIMATELY 3 FEET OFF THE GROUND ABOUT 40 FEET FROM ME. THERE WAS A BUBBLE ON TOP BUT IT WAS THE SAME COLOR AS THE REST OF THE CRAFT. WHEN THE OBJECT BANKED TO GO ABOVE ME I COULD SEE A SMALL OPENING TO THE BOTTOM THAT SEEMED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE GROUND. THERE WERE NO VISIBLE MOVING PARTS TO THE OBJECT BUT GAVE THE APPEARANCE OF WORKING BY MAGNETIC FORCE. IT SIMPLY BANKED AND CHANGED DIRECTION.

The text in the document is as follows:

This is in reply to your letters of 10 Sep and 24 Oct 64. We hope that we can give you a satisfactory explanation regarding the sighting of the object to which you refer. We are sorry that we cannot comply with your request for the complete file and details with which the sighting was investigated. It has been the policy of our agency to release only the names of principal witnesses. I am sure you will understand our reasons for not releasing these.

The statistics provided yearly, contain all of the information that can be given on the statistics. The last release on the evaluation of UFOs for the first half of 1964, was mailed to you on 2 Oct 64. In this release I noted that "UFO EVIDENCE" I made that the Stanford films were commented on as photo case #31, 18 Sep 56 and Project Bluebook, File #1382 indicated they were not accepted as genuine films and are considered as dubious. The attached letter from Dr. Hynek indicates that the opinion of the Camera Consultant, a project staff member, is that this film "since the location was committed by NICAP in their publication."

Regarding your question about a training film at Lackland AFB, on the subject of UFOs, we have no knowledge of the existence of such a film. Should you desire further information it is suggested that you contact the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force.

The sighting from Ulysses, Kansas, 11 Sep 64, presented certain conditions which would indicate that the object was something like a satellite.

The image contains a photograph depicting a "Flying saucer" sighted September 11 by a motorist near Ulysses, Kansas. The text below the image provides details about the sighting, indicating that the conditions suggest this could be a possibility of the Interplanetary Intelligence of Unidentified Flying Objects (IUFOUFO), as headlined.

TEXT FOUND IN THE DOCUMENT:

tumble used rolling down the road and being driven by the wind.
The following conditions were noted by the observer during this sighting:
The object was first observed to drop to a slightly lower altitude, then resumed a steady course. The sighting lasted approximately 1500 hours in either case the sighting occurred at dawn or just before dawn. The main body was described as being approximately 40-50 feet in diameter with a dome on top in the center giving it a somewhat bulbous appearance. The detail indicated. The description of the object was a dull color similar to brushed aluminum or stainless steel. The object followed the road for a short distance, then made a sharp right turn and disappeared from view in less than 5 seconds. It was driving 50 mph and appeared to be trying to avoid the observer's car at one point. Evidence of physical effects such as landing or taking off were not observed. In all probability the speed of the object was greatly in excess of the fastest conventional aircraft operated at the time. The acceleration and maneuverability attributed to the item or other projections of the object. The circumstances for the sighting and the characteristics led to an extensive examination of the situation by the observer. The driver of the car undoubtedly contributed some element of surprise or excitement which influenced her interpretation of what she observed. No other reports were received or any Campbell's.
and any comments which he may have regarding the siting. I would like to extend my appreciation for the model of a flying saucer.
