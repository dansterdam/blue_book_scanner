There are sufficient psychological explanations for this not
understood flying objects to provide plausible explaination af
port not otherwise explainable, the unknowns in identifying 
alone results chiefly from inability to estimate speed, distance, 
or size. 

All of the remaining 34 incidents are tabbed in detail in the
report. These incidents form no pattern in regard to time, of 
type or visibiity, of nature or geography or trend or ingredient
over; the times and range were difficult or impossible to judge
probably no injury have been experienced witnessed or reported
from age reliability.

Project Comments

APPENDIX I

In the following section of this report, each remaining uncle
incident is considered separately. It is not the inten to geney

of return to disappear. The traditional definition is merely the disc.
story of that incident in the respective files.

---

Incident No. 62 -- 5 September 1947, 2200-2230 hours, Logan, Utah.
A man and his wife, to...er with five other unidentified people, observed two
groups each of 15-50 small objects, yellow-white in color, flying several
thousand feet in the air at a hi... rate of speed. The weather was cloudy.

ANALYSIS: From the l...ited evidence submitted, it is practically
impossible to formulate a conclusion. Fast motion could be attributed to closeness
rather than to tr... linear distance. In an atmosphere of darkness, any illu-
sion may be enormous. Glare... light reflected from moving, low-hanging,
clouds, themselves not vi...ble, could readily account for this report. Light-
colored birds are another possibility.

UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #61, Gila -- Logan, Utah -- 8 September 1947

        This incident, and incident #62, which clearly refer to 
the same objects (witnesses were together at the time of observa-
tion) do not have an astronomical explanation.

        Since it was dark, any judgment of distance can be greatly
misleading, and extremely fast motion might be ascribed to close-
ness rather than to true linear distance.

The document is a structured report form with listed criteria for reporting a UFO sighting. The answers provided are incomplete and illegible in parts, making it difficult to extract accurate or meaningful information. This is typical for historical documents that have sustained wear over time or have been poorly preserved or reproduced.

There is no photograph present in the image you provided, just some text at the top with a lined pattern above it.

Here is the text output from the document:

A disc was observed by one experienced observer to be the length of a plane. Body elongated. No sound heard. Ten minutes were spent on the observation. Travels much faster than a plane.
