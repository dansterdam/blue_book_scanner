Buffalo 22, New York 
Mar 1, 1960

Mr. Lawrence J. Tacker 
Director, USAF
Public Information Division 
Office of Information Services 
Department of the Air Force 
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Tacker:

The Buffalo,Olean, Times-Olean, New York, dated 4/21/60, about 1:00 P.M. saw a group sighting of U.S.O. at about 11:25 P.M. by two observers in OHIO.

REPLY TO: AFOIN-44E2

SUBJECT: UFO Letter (Ref your )

TO: SAFOI-3D (Maj Tacker)

The Olean, New York sighting of 16 April 1960, has been evaluated. 
The ATIC conclusion is that birds were the probable cause of this sighting.

REMARKS: The answer here is that there is not sufficient information for a definite conclusion. Preliminary analysis indicates the possibility that it was migrating birds flying high. You cannot rule out the $10,000 fine.
