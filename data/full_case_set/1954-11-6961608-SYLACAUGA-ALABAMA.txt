AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: UNEXPLAINED INCIDENT AT SYLACAUGA, ALABAMA ON 30 NOV 54. 

LOCATION:  SYLACAUGA, ALABAMA

DATE/TIME: 30 NOVEMBER 1954, 1457 CST

SUMMARY: At approximately 1457 CST, 30 NOVEMBER 1954, a woman was struck on the left shoulder by a metallic object while working in her garden. The object is described as a dark gray metallic fragment approximately 8 to 10 inches long, 4 to 5 inches wide, and 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick. After striking the woman, the object was observed to skip across a road and come to rest about 40 feet from the point of impact. The woman was not seriously injured.

Examination of the object by the Anniston Ordnance Depot revealed that it was composed of a meteoric material weighing 8 pounds and 9 ounces. The outer surface was partially fused and the edges were sharp and jagged. The object contained several imbedded mineral and carbonaceous inclusions. 

The area over which the object traveled was thoroughly searched and no other fragments were found. The trajectory of the object indicated it entered the atmosphere at a shallow angle and impacted the ground at a point approximately 100 yards from the woman. Accurate astronomical data was obtained and a 180 degree parabolic curve was plotted from the point of impact to a point 6 miles distant which indicated an entry into the earth's atmosphere at an altitude of approximately 50 miles.

Air Rescue Squadron presently had a helicopter in Sylacauga to obtain the object reported to have fallen in that area, and it was expected to return to Maxwell APB at approximately 1712 hours.

At 1700 hours, 30 November 1954, the late edition of the Alabama Journal, a local newspaper, was screened for publicity concerning the cited reports. The following items were listed from the front page of said newspaper and are quoted verbatim below:

"PILOT REPORTS BLAST 60,000 FEET ABOVE MONTGOMERY"

"A pilot flying over Montgomery early this afternoon reported sighting of an unidentified object over Montgomery, about 60,000 feet up."

"The object exploded about 1:30. The pilot was not identified."

"Meanwhile, a resident of the Cloverland area reported she saw an object, which she described as larger than a housetrailer, disintegrated before it hit the ground."

"Police said they did not have any report of the alleged explosion and the Highway Patrol reported that a search was on in the Sylacauga area for an unidentified object which fell with a splash in an area north of Montgomery and southeast of Birmingham."

"Reports received here 2 times said what appeared to be an explosion was heard high over Sylacauga. An unidentified object fell through the roof of a home and injured a woman."

At 1730 hours, 30 November 1954, R. B. ROBERTS, Captain, 23792A, 48th Air Rescue Squadron, pilot of helicopter referred to previously, returned from Sylacauga, Alabama, and released to Special Agent the object which he had recovered. This object, upon examination, was found to weigh approximately nine (9) pounds, and was of a rock or metallic substance, and was of the general color. ROBERTS advised that he had obtained this object from Mayor EDWARD J. HOWARD and Chief of Police W. P. ASHCRAFT of Sylacauga, Alabama.

17. On 1 December 1954, ATCHLEY and the writer, interviewed Professor FREDERICK H. MORRIS, Geologist, concerning the SYLACAUGA, ALABAMA, REPORT. Mr. MORRIS is Director, Geognostic Institute, concerning the object. After considerable deliberation and examination of the object, Dr. MORRIS advised this office to express a reluctance on the part of the USAF to release this report to Wright-Patterson AFB, which would permit him only a very limited examination of the object. He could definitely it considerably as a matter of secrecy to avoid another demand meteoric or of the object. MORRIS was briefly convinced it 18. On 1 December 1954, JAMES G. PRATT, Colonel, Commander, Maxwell AFB, was briefed on all available pertinent information concerning the object by Special Agent CONLEY, D/1, SPIOI, I/G, Alabama and the writer. PRATT telephonically contacted the Operations Officer, 4602nd AISS, Ent AFB, concerning this information and acknowledged that Headquarters made a decision to not allow the object to leave its present place because of security reasons. This step was taken in view of increasing publicity resulting from numerous and frequent protests made by HOWARD MENGEL (HUGHES) concerning the USA'S withholding the object. It was determined from local newspapers that MENGEL had this data obtained an attorney for the purpose of obtaining the deliverable from the USAF.
19. The following information from the Montgomery Advertiser, a newspaper of Montgomery, Alabama, and from the Birmingham Post-Herald, a Birmingham, Alabama newspaper, both of 1 December 1954, is quoted verbatim below:

"FRAGMENT OF REPORTABLE CRASHES SYLACAUGA HOME

"SYLACAUGA, Ala., Nov. 30 (AP)- A meteorite crashed through the roof of a house here today and slightly injured Mrs. Hewlett Hodges, 32.

"George Swindal, field representative of the U.S. Geological Survey, stated the meteorite, though damaged and identified, it as a saphetic meteorite.

"A mysterious explosion in the Sylacauga area, about 25 miles southeast of Birmingham, set off a three-state search today in which 35 or 20 planes took part. But there were no planes reported missing.

"The explosion was seen as far south as Phenix City, on the Alabama-Georgia border.

"Dr. Walter E. Jones, Alabama state geologist, said evidently a meteor exploded southeastward Alabama, and Mrs. Hodges was hurt by a particle of it."

"Swindal, who is conducting a water survey in Sylacauga, said after he identified the meteorite, it was taken to Maxwell Air Force Base at Montgomery, where the Air Force is required to examine such objects."

"Swindle said Mayor Ed J. Howard has assured Dr. Jones the meteorite will be placed in the state museum at the University of Alabama when it is returned by the Air Force.

"Sylacauga police rushed to the Hodges home when the object crashed through the roof about 1 p.m.
"Mrs. Hodges said she was lying on a couch in the living room of the frame house when the meteorite smashed a three-foot wide hole in the room and came tumbling through the ceiling.

"'It hit our radio at one end of the couch and bounced off on me. It hit me on the arm and hip,' she said.

"Police summoned a doctor when they arrived and Mrs. _____  was treated for bruises. She was reported in good condition tonight.

"'We had a little excitement around here today,' she told her husband when he came home from work.

"'A meteorite fell through the roof.'

"He is a tree surgeon and knew nothing of the incident until he came home from work. He had been trimming trees for the telephone company.

"'If don't believe I want to talk to anybody else for a while,' said Mrs. _____."

"'She said there must have been several hundred,' he added.

"He said he had no insurance on the house, and didn't estimate the damage.

"Swindle said the meteorite was about six inches in diameter. He said the inside was a metallic, grey granular substance, which resembled to tests given for ensilpinde. The outside casing was a black shiny appearing substance.

"'Dr. Jones said tonight he would welcome the meteorite, since the University museum does not have such an object from Alabama.'"

"A woman who lived directly across the street from the house, Mrs. ***, was in her front yard, planting shrubs when the incident fell. 
"But I didn't hear anything," she said. "I didn't even know anything had happened until somebody came and told me about it."
"Mrs. *** said she didn't hear anything either. 
"She was asleep on a sofa in the living room, sleeping with her face toward the back of the sofa, her left hip up. 
"She describes how it knocked her across the room and struck her on the hip and injured her hand and arm which were lying on the hip.
"I woke up and thought the house was falling down," Mrs. *** said. "It was in the next room booming. She came running in and asked me if the house was falling down. 
"If and I didn't know. I thought it was the chimney. I got up and started out of the house. Then my hip started hurting. 
"I hadn't even seen the rock!"
"Then she and her mother found the hole in the roof and saw the 'rock' on the floor. They called the police.

"Van Sandt said that the object was cold to the touch when he arrived.
"Mrs. *** and her mother had not disturbed the meteorite.

"Mrs. *** thought at first the object had fallen from a radio set in the corner and hit her. 'But now I don't believe it did,' she said. 'The radio might have been hit by a piece of the ceiling or roof.'"

"After he viewed it, an employee of Bell Telephone Co. said he thought he could 'get enough evidence that the thing fell in my house.'

"Swindle said Sylacauga Mayor Ed J. Howard gave assurance that the object will be placed in the State Museum of Natural History at the University of Alabama when it is returned by the Air Force.

"But Mrs. _____, his husband, who didn't know about the incident until he got home from work early last night, was furious about the loss of the meteorite.

"'I'm going to demand that the Air Force return the stone to me,' he said. 'They had no business taking it away in the first place.'

"Swindle, the geologist, said the meteorite was six inches in diameter. He said the inside was a metallic, gray granular substance which responded to tests given for sulphides.

"The outside coating was a black satin appearing substance.

"Besides striking Mrs. _____, the meteorite caused quite a stir in Sylacauga.

"Almost everyone in town saw the smoke which followed the explosion and a goodly number saw the explosion itself.

"A country store operator and farmer, was outside his home when he heard the explosions.

"'First there was a loud boom,' he said. 'Then in a few seconds there was another one and then a third.'

"He said after the first and second explosions, he located the direction of the noise and looked aloft and saw the third. There was a little fire and a lot of black smoke."

"Police summoned a doctor who took x-rays. He did not find any broken bones and sent her home.

"Her husband did not know of any of this until he arrived home from work. 

"'We had a little excitement around here today', she told him in a wife-like fashion. 'A meteor fell through the roof.'

"The home is one of the oldest houses in the Sylacauga area. It is a rambling wooden house set among groves of old trees.

"One witness to the explosion said that before it exploded, the meteor appeared to blaze on fire.

"'It was a blaze of fire with a lot of smoke', said Miss XXXXX, 22, a waitress at the Depot Grill near Sylacauga. 

"She was standing outside waiting for a bus with two other women.

"'One of them said to look at the plane on fire', Miss XXXXX said. 'We looked and there it was.'

"Just at that moment, she said, it blew up in a blinding flash and a lot of noise.

"'It appeared to come out of the southeast.'

"Several other persons in Sylacauga thought it was a burning plane also, and a search with some 30 or 40 airplanes got under way shortly to look for the crash. 

"There were variances in the descriptions of the smoke from the explosions.

"In Sylacauga, it appeared black.

"In Birmingham and in other places at a distance, it appeared white.

"There was immediate reaction to the meteors story from over the nation.

"Experts agreed unanimously that XXXXXXXXX was the first person known to have been struck by a meteorite.

"'The curious astronomer and registrar at Birmingham-Southern College, said he never had heard of it before.'

"Dr. XXXXX, head of the astronomy department at Agnes Scott College, at Atlanta, said that the injury to XXXXXXXXX could be attributed to a meteor."

(T James E. Pratt) it was mutually agreed that the 4602nd should obtain
the object in accordance with the provisions of AFR 200-2 (UFOB Reporting).
The object was returned to Ft 2-C headquarters located at Dobbins AFB, Georgia
where arrangements for mailing it were initiated. A complete narrative report
is listed as attachment #2 of this file.

ATIC ACTION
On 2 December 1954, Captain Hardin, Chief, ATIC-5, received a telephone
call from Col. Dennison (Exec. Off. of the 4602nd Air Rescue Squadron, Maxwell
Col. Dennison stated that he was "under pressure" to return the object to
Mrs. [REDACTED]. Capt. Hardin assured Col. Dennison that ATIC would not harm the
original appearance of the object in any way during the examination. Capt
Hardin suggested Col Dennison contact Mrs. [REDACTED] and reassure her the object
would be returned to her as soon as possible.

As of 3 December 1954, the object had not been received at ATIC. Capt
Hardin, ATIC-5, placed a call to Ft 2-C of the 4602nd to inquire as to its
status. Prior authorization for direct contact with a field unit had been
obtained from Hq 4602nd AISS, Ent AFB, Colorado. Capt. Hardin was informed
by 1st Lt Richard C. Vaughn, OCT, Ft 2-C, that he had encountered some
difficulty in transporting the object to ATIC. He stated that he would
immediately by first class mail and register it.

On 6 December 1954, the object, enclosed in a wooden box, was received at
ATIC and signed for by T/Sgt Drapperd, ATIC-5. The object was then
examined visually by Dr. Robinson, ATIC-4, whose evaluation is listed as
attachment #3 of this file.

Text transcription from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

"numerous astronomers state in books on the subject that no one ever has been struck
of billions which strike the earth's atmosphere each day.

"Most of them are tiny particles of sand-like material, remnants of lost
worlds that exploded cons ago and swarm around the sun like bats.

"Some are in regular orbits and when the earth passes through these meteor
orbits more stay than normally-

"Only rarely does one last more than an instant of a second before being
burned to a crisp by earth's atmosphere.

"The burning of the meteors is caused by their tremendous speed as they come
into contact with the earth's atmosphere.

"Meteors generally start burning at about 100 miles up and burn out before
they hit the ground. If one is large enough to survive the miles of air it crosses, an 8 pound
meteor hit a cane field and exploded in a manner similar to one which blew up over
Sylacauga.

"The pieces then drift down over wide areas, hitting the ground at only
moderate speeds because the air resistance slows them down.

"The fact that the Sylacauga meteor exploded at a tremendous height is substantiated by the fact that the explosion was seen from three states.

"It was seen at Phenix City and a wild report started there that the meteor
was a flying saucer and that a woman saw a man get out of it.

"Guardsmen went out in planes, jeeps, ambulances and helicopters trying to
find the object.

"But Guardsmen were unable to find anything, even though they scoured the
area.

"The bright flash across the sky was reported simultaneously at Atlanta, 
Newnan and Columbus, Ga., several parts of Alabama, and as far west as Greenville, Ala.

"In Atlanta, the Air Force and State Patrol received several reports of a 
probable plane crash near Sylviana, 40 miles southeast of Atlanta. Two patrol cars
searched the area for two hours before calling off the search.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"Radio Station WCOH in Neunan reported numerous calls from persons who said they saw an unidentified flaming object in the sky.

"A Civil Aeronautics Adm'r. employee in Montgomery saw the falling meteor. He described it as 'a bright light like the trailing end of a meteor's tail which fell across the horizon from a great height.'

"A Maxwell Air Force pilot who was flying at high altitude also sighted it and gave a similar description.

"National Guard Sgt. Joe Clark of Elba was with the Guard in Phenix City.

"In Sylacauga, the descriptions of the explosions were as varied as the persons who heard it.

"No come, it was just loud 'boom, boom, boom'.

"Others heard small crackling noises and popping sounds between the big explosions.

"A Sylacauga city councilman, B. J. Phillips said it sounded like thunder to him. 'He said the sights during the explosion occurred.'

"Being the first person to be hit by a falling meteorite was of almost no moment to her when asked how she felt about the dubious honor, she said: 'I feel bruised.'

"It was only when the stars fell on Alabama at last."

The report is signed by Dr. L.V. Robinson.

Text extracted from the document:

AERO PRELIMINARY EVALUATION 2 December 1954

The UFO which struck the house in Sylacauga, Alabama on 30 Nov 54 was initially a meteorite, i.e. a meteoroid striking the earth's atmosphere. It showed a bright display of itself similar in appearance to those observed in 1872 and 1855 when the great meteors shot through the sky. The internal condition of the meteoroid which had a period of about 3.3 years shows that its orbit was the same as that of the cmomet or Giacobini-Zinner, which had a perihelion in 1946 and disappeared after 1952. The great showers or 1872 and 1885 occurred when the comet head disappeared. The same condition apply now. Only the remnants of the debris of the comet are seen: and it is possible to see members of the shower almost any time of the night. Only the brighter ones, however, could register their occurrence by an explosion during the daylight hours. Some are seen every year because the debris of the comet has been strewn along the whole path of the comet and the earth in its motion around the sun crosses the path of the come on 30 Nov each year.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document titled "JOINT MESSAGEFORM" from the "AFOIN-ATIC" division, discussing the details of the Alabama meteorite, which is described as a dense stony matter with many grains of nickel-iron alloys (aerolite type meteorites). The document mentions that the outer portion of the meteorite showed evidence of heat erosion from friction with the earth's atmosphere, and that the meteorite was seen to explode from Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. It also notes that some other fragments distributed over a large area remain to be recovered, and that the speed of the meteorite when it entered the earth's atmosphere was probably in excess of 15 miles per second. The document is dated December 5, 1954.

JOINT MESSAGEFORM 
FROM: COMDR ATIC
TO: D/I HQ USAF WASH D C
INFO: 
FROM AFOIN-ATIC-R2775E
The Alabama meteorite is made up of dense stony matter with many grains of nickel-iron alloys (aerolite type meteorites). The outer portion of the meteorite is blackened, giving evidence of heat erosion from friction with the earth's atmosphere. The original meteorite was much larger than that portion which was recovered, since the main mass appears to have exploded from Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. Some other fragments distributed over a very large area remain to be recovered, and much of it must have fallen as ashes. The speed of the meteorite when it entered the earth's atmosphere was probably in excess of 15 miles per second. Evidence indicates that the Alabama meteorite was a member of the Andrómid shower, occurring between 24 November - 7 December. These generally came from the north as in this case. If it is from this shower, it is from the debris of Biela's comet which disintegrated after 1852. Fragments from this comet have fallen for centuries.

The document discusses the examination of meteoritic material and the increase in meteorite activity observed by Mr. Castillo during November 1954. It also mentions that one set of meteorite photographs were given to Dr. Taylor upon his request.

8 December 1954

On 7 December 1954, ATAI-5 was visited by Dr. Taylor and Mr. Castillo from the G & N Laboratory, WADC. They visually examined the meteoritic and agreed with Dr. Robinson's original evaluation. Mr. Castillo stated he has been monitoring effects of ionization on HF radio signals through an oscilloscope for the past two years. He has been especially interested in the returns he has been receiving from meteorite trails. He continued that during the month of November, 1954, there had been a mark increase in the meteorite activity. The attached photograph is one that he obtained on the night of 21 Oct 1954 which vividly depicts a fair size return of a meteorite trail. Mr. Castillo operates a station VHF in Springfield, Ohio. He continues that during the week of the Athina incident, he received unusual amounts of meteorite returns on his graph.

One set of the meteorite photographs were given to Dr. Taylor upon his request.

1. Reference report AF Form 112, P2-C-UFO8-1, dated 2 December 1954, from Robbins Air Force Base, Georgia. Enclosed for your information are two duplicate sets of prints of photographs taken on 9 December 1954 at the Air Technical Intelligence Center.

2. The object was received at the Air Technical Intelligence Center 1000 hours 3 December 1954, and was forwarded to ATIC-3-5 at 1200 hours 3 December 1954, where it has been loaned to the Smithsonian Institution for study.

3. The following is the preliminary analysis of the object by the Smithsonian Institute's examination:

Glasses and meteorities may be divided roughly into three classes. One category includes those fragments which are completely vitrified, often called aerolites. This category (called the iron meteorites or nickol-iron alloys) appears to be an aerolite, weighing 3 pounds, 8 ounces.

Most meteors and meteorites are quite frequent. Explosions of very large meteors are quite frequent. Some showers have been known to produce hundreds or even thousands of separate meteors moving with high speeds, that therefore explode. The Alabama meteors were seen to explode. Some other fragments were distributed over a very large area that remain to be recovered.

The average limits of altitudes of meteor paths are known. They select appear at greater heights than 50 miles, for as greater heights there is insufficient air to cause one to burn, and generally they burn up before getting as low as 10 miles. Only those large ones reach the ground as aerolites.

1. Reference report AF Form 112, F2-C-UFOB-1, dated 2 December 1954, from December 1954 investigation. Two duplicate sets of prints of the Sylacauga, Alabama meteorite/flying object photographed on 6 December 1954 at the Air Technical Intelligence Center.

2. The object was received at the Air Technical Intelligence Center 1000 hours on 6 December 1954 and was forwarded to AFOIN-T at 1200 hours 6 December 1954, where it has been identified to the Smithsonian Institution.

3. The following is the preliminary analysis of the object by the final evaluation as pending the results of the Smithsonian Institute's examination:
a. Meteors and meteorites may be divided roughly into three classes. One class is almost completely opaque, metallic, etc.; another is largely stony; and another, members of which are frequently called siderites, shows evidence of some internal crystalline structure with many cavities (from Alabama) appears to be an aerolite, weighing 8 pounds, 5 ounces.
b. Explosions of very large meteors are quite frequent. Most meteors are found larger than the head of a pin, and these burn up miles above the earth. On account of the heat generated, the larger meteors move with high speeds and therefore explode. The Alabama meteorite was much larger than the smaller part discovered, for it was tom into several smaller pieces on impact.
c. The average limits of altitudes of meteor paths are known. They seldom appear at greater heights than 70 miles, for at greater heights there is insufficient air to cause sufficient friction to heat them to the point of burning. They burn up before getting as low as 40 miles. Only those large enough to withstand the retarding effect of the air throughout their path reach the ground.

2. The object was received at the Air Technical Intelligence Center on 6 December 1954 and forwarded to ATIC:K at 1200 hours 9 December 1954, where it has been loaned to the Smithsonian Institution for additional study.

3. The following is the preliminary analysis of the object by ATIC; the final evaluation is pending the results of the Smithsonian Institute's examination:

a. Meteors and meteorites may be divided roughly into three classes. One class is glassy, compact, and another is largely stony; and another, members of which are frequently called specimens, is composed of dense masses with many cracks or minute cavity-like holes. The material from Sylacauga, Alabama, appears to be an example of the last class, weighing 8 pounds 3 ounces.

b. Explosions of very large meteors are quite frequent. Most meteors are larger than those seen at ground level. On account of the heat generated, the larger meteors moving with high speeds must therefore explode. The Alabama meteorite was much larger than the small part recovered, for it was seen to explode some 50 miles other fragments distributed over a very large area remain to be recovered, and much of it must have fallen as ashes.

c. The average limits of altitude of meteor paths are known. They seldom appear at greater heights than 90 miles, for it is greater heights there is insufficient air to cause one to burn up before getting as low as 40 miles. Only those large meteors which burn up at very great heights are known.

1. Reference report 17 Dec. 54. Preliminary report to ADC of unidentified flying object. From Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia, sighting report of two daylight sightings of unidentified flying objects. The sightings were at Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia on 8 December 1954. 

2. The object was observed at 1300 hours on 8 December 1954, red elliptical in shape, approximately 1200 feet altitude, speed estimate in excess of 600 M.P.H. The object was tracked on radar approximately 1200 hours 8 December 1954, where it had entered the pattern at approximately 1200 hours, 8 December 1954.

3. The following is the preliminary evaluation in possible explanations:
a. Meteors and meteorites - one class is almost certainty another is largely stony, and appears to be very dense, like rock, somewhat like aerolite, weighing 3 pounds, 8 ounces.
b. Explosions of very large meteors at high altitudes, well above the earth; not resulting in craters or anything striking the ground, because they do not come to the earth. Some other fragments remain unrecovered, and much of their mass may be scattered.
c. The average limits of all phenomena observed.  They seldom appear at greater altitudes than 100 miles, where there is insufficient air for combustion and they burn up before reaching the earth.

Ltr, ATIC, SUBJ: (U) Unidentified Flying Object Recovered at Sylacauga, Alabama

Through a penetrate all the earth's atmosphere actually hit the earth, and these are called "meteors." Velocity of a meteor plays an important part on whether or not it hits the ground. At the time a meteor hits the earth's atmosphere--100 miles high, say--its velocity will range between 9 miles per second and 26 miles per second. Since the earth's motion around the sun gives it a velocity of 18 miles per second, one therefore finds velocities between 26-18 and 26+18 miles per second.

If one knows the exact direction from which it came and the time of the day, the data evidences seem to indicate. However, this the Alabama meteorite was a member of the Andromedid shower, occurring between November 7- December 7. These come from the north, but the exact direction depends on the time of day they are seen. Ordinarily they would travel either higher or lower than 9 miles per second. If it is a member of this shower, it is from the debris of Biela and cones which disintegratedafter 1852. Fragment. At this time, it was spherical, perhaps being a stone weighing 260 pounds which fell in Alsace, November 15, 1492.

4. Arrangements have been made for the meteorite to be returned directly to its owner from the Smithsonian Institute.

LT., ATIC, SUBJ: (U) UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT RECOVERED AT SYLACAUGA, ALABAMA

The record demonstrates all the earth's atmosphere actually hit the earth's surface and these are called "meteorites". Velocity of a meteor plays an important part on whether or not it hits the earth. At the time a meteor hits the earth's atmosphere - 100 miles high, say - its velocity will range between 6 miles per second and 46 miles per second. Since the earth's motion around the sun gives it a velocity of 18 miles per second, the average velocity of a meteorite is 26 miles per second, one therefore finds velocities between 26-40 and 26-18 miles per second.

The speed of the Alabama meteorite can be estimated only if one knows the exact direction from which it came and the time of day it fell. The evidence seems to indicate, however, that the Alabama meteorite was a member of the Andromid shower, occurred between November 8th and December 7th. During some from the north, but the exact direction depends on the time of day they are seen. Ordinarily their speed is 20 miles per second, but this figure may be augmented by "cosmic velocity" - the debris of Biela's comet which disappeared after 1852. Fragments from this comet have fallen, sometimes perhaps being a stone weighing 260 pounds which fell in Alsace, November 16, 1492, between 11 and 12 A.M.

Arrangements have been made for the meteorite to be returned directly to its owner from the Smithsonian Institute.
