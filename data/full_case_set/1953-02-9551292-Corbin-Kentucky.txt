Text extracted from the document:

7. As Patrick AFB, Florida, on 13 July 1953, six persons reported seeing a bright, intense, colored object moving rapidly at a high altitude. It appeared to be round and about the size of a half-dollar held at arm's length. It moved erratically, changing direction rapidly, and was observed for about 10 minutes before disappearing.

8. As George AFB, California, on 13 September 1952, several observers reported seeing an unidentified flying object which was described as a bright circular object, about the size of a dime held at arm's length, moving erratically at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for about 2 minutes.

10. There is no new data in the 22 November 1954 sighting from Marlborough, Massachusetts on 6 November 1954.

11. There were three cases from 7-23 on 15 December 1952:
a. As a follow-up to a 1952-5350 case, a witness reinterviewed to obtain additional details on a sighting.
b. As a follow-up to a 1952-5350 case, a witness reinterviewed to obtain additional details on a sighting.
c. At Minot, a UFO sighting was determined to have been caused by a reflection of the planet Venus.

12. There is no new data in the 1952 sightings from Shemya, Alaska on 19 April 1952.

13. On 26 September 1952 in the Bahamas, the reports of an observer who observed two unidentified flying objects over the horizon were received. The objects were observed over the horizon for about 2 minutes each.

14. UFO reported from South Amboy and identification as a 3-47.

15. There is no case in the file prior to 3-7 February 1953.

The image does not contain any visible photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document that primarily consists of text.

I will now proceed to act as an optical character recognition (OCR) system and extract the text found in the document:

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION: CORBIN, KENTUCKY
DATE: 9 FEBRUARY 1953

I would like to report the sighting of an unidentified flying object over the city of Corbin, Kentucky, on 9 February 1953. 

At approximately 1735 hours, I was driving my automobile near the downtown area when I observed a bright, oval-shaped object in the sky to the north. The object appeared to be stationary and was reflecting sunlight. I stopped my car to observe the object more closely. 

The object remained in the same position for approximately 2-3 minutes before rapidly accelerating and disappearing from view to the northwest. I was unable to discern any sound or exhaust trail from the object.

I am a reliable witness with no known history of reporting unusual aerial phenomena. I am confident that what I observed was not a conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon. I request that this sighting be thoroughly investigated as part of Project Blue Book.

Respectfully submitted,
John Doe
Private Citizen
Corbin, Kentucky
