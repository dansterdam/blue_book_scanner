IR-7-52
PAGE 2 OF 3 PAGES

T/Sgt. Andrew A. Trowbridge, AF 15208983, charge of quarters for the 127th Air
Police Squadron, was contacted by telephone on 1 July 1952. She reported having seen
unidentified lights in the sky on the night of 30 June 1952. 

Investigation by this office produced the following information:

1. Miss _____________ was interviewed and claims she sighted lights on 30 June.
They were bright, appeared stationary, then appeared to be about 2 inches in diameter.
In her opinion, the lights were appearing at different heights, some close, some farther
away. She stated the lights appeared as yellow pinpoint lights, some flashing like
strobe lights or other flare-like phenomena.

2. The objects were viewed each night at about 2100 hours in the evening for
an interval of a half hour to 45 minutes.

3. Observations were visual.

4. Observations were made from subjects home at ___________, Phoenix,
Arizona. Light appeared in an easterly direction on 30 June and 1 July 1952. It
was in the high cirrus clouds about 60 degrees above the horizon. (Observed at about
2110 on 1 July 1952). Light appeared and disappeared at varying intervals (20-30 sec).

5. _____________ alleges that she has made numerous other sightings in the
past 1 1/2 years, some with her mother and reported only to her mother, but nothing before
because of family illness.

6. The weather conditions at the time of the sightings were reported as follows:
30 June - Clear, wind 8-10 mph, visibility 15+ miles; 1 July - Scattered cirrus clouds,
wind 8-10 mph, visibility 15+ miles.

7. The Phoenix weather bureau reports the releasing of weather balloons carrying
chemical lights for observation purposes. Balloons are released on the average of once per
day between 1100 - 1400 LCT. Balloon was observed on 1 July 1952 over Phoenix - to the
southwest at 1240 LCT. Altitude not given.

8. Captain Wm. R. Brodie, AC 768833, of the 127th Pilot Training Group observed
a low flying, disc-shaped object, with multicolored lights that appeared to be over 500 feet
in diameter at an altitude of 10,000 feet on 12 June 1952. Angle of approach was such that
aircraft appeared nearly stationary for 10-15 minutes.

No electrical message forwarded because of low evaluation and information
developed.
