Dear Mr. _______,

In response to your request, please be advised that the incident reported in your letter of 7 February 1965 has been evaluated by the Project Blue Book staff.

The incident as described, which allegedly occurred near Fort Knox, Kentucky, on 2 January 1965, has been classified as a possible satellite or space debris reentry. This classification is based upon the physical description and behavior of the object as reported, which is consistent with known characteristics of such reentries.

While we appreciate your interest, we do not believe the incident warrants further investigation at this time, as it is likely explained by this natural phenomenon. If you have any additional information which would indicate this classification is incorrect, please let us know.

Sincerely,

The text in the document reads:

Dear Sir:

Yesterday, January 4 at approximately 4:35 P.M. an Army aircraft (T-28) was flying over this area and an unusual phenomenon was observed. The aircraft pilot reported seeing a high speed object slightly to the east of the aircraft. This object appeared white or light in color, circular in shape, and was estimated to have been approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. The pilot stated the object appeared to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, estimated at 3,000 to 5,000 mph, and was observed for approximately 5-10 seconds before disappearing from sight.

TRANSCRIPT:

At approximately 6:25 p.m. on 10 January 1965, myself and Wendell Wayman, a Deputy Sheriff of Hardin County, Kentucky, were called to investigate a report of a strange light or lights observed in the area of Fort Knox, Kentucky. 

Upon arriving at the scene, approximately 7 miles east of Vine Grove, Kentucky, we observed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be hovering. The light was bright white in color and seemed to be approximately 50-100 feet off the ground. The light appeared to be approximately 50-75 yards in diameter. 

After observing the light for approximately 15 minutes, it suddenly began to move in a southerly direction at a very rapid rate of speed. The light was so bright that it illuminated the entire area for several seconds. The light then seemed to fade or extinguish as it moved out of sight to the south.

While observing the light, we received several reports from local residents who had also observed the strange light phenomena. All reports were generally consistent in their description of the object.

This report is submitted for your information and consideration.

Respectfully,
Patrick J. Sheeny, Sergeant
Hardin County Sheriff's Dept.
Dec. 29 65

Transcription of the text in the document:

Since the report of the observation of the flying object at Ft Knox, Ky, on 8 Jan 65, the observer, M/Sgt (redacted), has been interviewed on two occasions to obtain additional details. The interview was conducted by Capt (redacted) and myself.

The main points developed in the interviews were:

1. Object was first sighted at approx 1845L, 8 Jan 65, as M/Sgt (redacted) was driving his car from Ft Knox to Louisville, Ky. He was about 2 miles SE of Ft Knox on Hwy 31W when he observed the object.

2. Object was first sighted in the south-southwest portion of the sky and was moving in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed.

3. Object was observed for approx 30 seconds during which time it proceeded across the sky in a straight line and disappeared from view in the northern portion of the sky.

4. Object was described as being elongated or cigar-shaped, silver or aluminum in color, and about 20-30 feet in length. No wings, tail, or other appendages were observed.

5. Object did not appear to be an aircraft, balloon, or any other known type of flying object. The speed and manner of flight were not characteristic of conventional aircraft.

6. Weather conditions at the time were clear, and the object was easily visible against the sky.

M/Sgt (redacted) impressed the interviewers as being a credible observer who was very careful in his description of the observed object. He has had several years of experience in aircraft identification, having served as a crew chief on various types of military aircraft.

"Report of a Collision of a Bright Light
One man said he was going to work at 5:30 AM 
about 8 miles from Fort Knox, Kentucky, when he saw a
bright light in the sky. At first he thought it was a star,
until it seemed to come closer and closer. Then it appeared
to be hovering about 100 feet off the ground. At one point 
it came very near the car and then seemed to go back up
into the sky. He said the light was so bright he could not
look at it directly. After it went up it seemed to disappear.
No more sightings were reported in the area."

their merely an taken to show a convoy wowing along. Come one could find to
Cane from articles 4 or 5 mile away. Our came a very mote object move slowly
any than across the sky, moving from East to West. When it to reached about the
center of o sky it stopped and hovered for about a minute. It then moved back
the way it came from East to West with the same deliberate and
pace. During this time it appeared to at times become brighter and at times
dimmer. At the time of the sighting, there were high cirrus clouds in the sky
but the object was definitely above these clouds. The abject was not noticed by
any of the persons in the convoy and the only reason it was observed was
because one of the vehicle drivers happened to glance up at the sky. The
quality of the report would indicate that it was something quite unusual and
not easily explainable as any known type of aircraft. The observer was a very
mature and reliable person and his description of the sighting appears to be
straightforward and factual. He indicated that he was very familiar with the
appearance of conventional aircraft and this was definitely something quite
different.

UPO WASH WASHINGTON, D.C. - 1965 
January 14, 1965 

The Washington Post carried an AP dispatch on 13 January 1965 which stated that Colonel David R. Modica, the Deputy Commanding General (Air Defense) of the Fourth US Army at Fort Knox, Kentucky, reported that unidentified flying objects had been sited over the installation during the period 6-10 January 1965. He said that his headquarters had been notified by the U.S. Army Air Defense Command and that the objects had also been picked up on radar. Colonel Modica said the objects were cylindrical in shape and that one of them had hovered over the post at an altitude of 2,000 feet. 

Later Lieutenant Tice, according to Mr. Paul Seay, reported over the telephone that objects had again been sited over Fort Knox during the evening of 14 January 1965. These objects were observed moving at high speed, hovering, and then accelerating at terrific speeds. These sightings were also seen by others who had a had been given orders to refrain from discussing the incidents. 

The Washington Post on 14 January carried a brief item stating that several other calls by observers were confirmed by NORAD and FAA reports which showed the objects.

JETS CHASE FLYING SAUCERS OVER WASHINGTON, D.C. - "An incredible UFO sighting was made in the nation's capital on the afternoon of January 23, 1965. Five US jet interceptors from Andrews AFB near Washington chased a formation of fast-moving unidentified objects over the city for nearly an hour. The pilots reported that the objects were metallic, round, and maneuvered with fantastic speed and evasive tactics that seemed to defy the laws of physics. Two or more of the objects appeared to be much closer than the others and seemed larger in size. The pilots stated that they were convinced the objects were under intelligent control. It was an incident that received national attention and whose significance has never been fully explained. There was no question in the minds of the pilots that they were dealing with visitors from another world, whose technologies were vastly superior to our own. They expressed frustration at their inability to shoot down these elusive craft, and amazement at the seemingly impossible things the objects could do. The news of this sighting eventually became public, but the Air Force's official explanation - that the pilots were actually chasing the planet Venus - was met with widespread skepticism and disbelief. Many feel that the truth about this and other dramatic UFO encounters is still being kept from the public.

UFOs Over D.C.
The Amateur Radio Tracking of Some
Unidentified Objects on January 15, 1965
By Rod Henderson
(The following document was mentioned in a recent article in FATE on the UFO activity over the Washington, D.C. area on January 15, 1956. The first time many readers have had a chance to see the original account.)
On Saturday night, January 15, 1956, amateur radio operators in the Washington, D.C. area picked up radio signals that were being exchanged between two or three unidentified objects which were moving rapidly through the night sky over the nation's capital. The observers at the Warrenton, Va., Amateur Radio Tracking Station were following the movements of the objects and radioing information to the Washington Post for publication.
The newspaper article stated that when the objects disappeared from radar, the Post would receive a "big turn down" and they would know the objects had moved out of range. A large number of people telephoned the newspaper with reports of seeing strange lights in the sky, and many more heard the story on radio and television.
The sightings caused considerable excitement and the Air Force and the Federal Aviation Agency became involved in the investigation. The Washington Post for 15 January contained an article about the sighting and stated that the objects were apparently not aircraft or satellites.
Jan. V. Zdenĕk, who was one of a dozen or so amateur radio operators monitoring the signals, stated that the objects were transmitting on a frequency of about 143.58 megacycles. Ed Kydd, who was two or a dozen or so amateur radio operators assisting, said the objects were traveling at tremendous speeds which cannot be measured by amateur equipment.
In the article several hypotheses were put forth as to what the objects could be. And they may well have been tests of some new secret devices, but the Pentagon and the Air Force have firmly stated that nothing "new" was being tested that night.
The Defense Department said these things are now common with them, but must be kept classified lest the Russians and others pry into them. The Washington, D.C. area had the same comment on previous occasions, namely, "they were exercises in connection with air defense problems." So there.

D.C. phenomena were a commercial interest near the flying things... While rumored or claimed to be about USAF Northern Command aircraft or some such, the identified objects.

"An Irwindale, California observed a light-colored object cross the sky on January 13th, 1965 at about 6:30 p.m. It was visible for about 2-3 minutes and was observed to make several abrupt changes in direction and speed. It appeared to be shaped like a saucer and had a glowing or luminous appearance. It rapidly changed directions several times during the observation period. The witness felt this was not an aircraft, satellite, or any known object that could be readily identified."

Jan. 13, 1965
Riverside, Calif.
Dear Sirs:
On Jan, 10, 1965, at approximately 10:05 P. M. I witnessed a strange object in the night sky while driving home from work. This object was triangular in shape and appeared to be stationary, except that it was oscillating slightly and moving rapidly from side to side. 
The object was lit up brilliantly on the underside, and on the topside the lights were very dim. It did not blink. It made a slight "whining noise" - no other sound. The estimated altitude was about 1,000 feet, and the distance was approximately 1 mile away. 
For about 3 to 5 seconds, the speed of the object was very slow, then it accelerated tremendously and was out of sight in a matter of seconds, leaving no trail.
The brilliant lights shining down made me think at first that it might be a helicopter, but it was moving in a very unnatural way and was too high and too fast for a helicopter.
I would appreciate any information you could give me concerning this incident.
Sincerely,

Special Incident Report 35-6m
Investigation - Ft, Knox, Kentucky
Seri no. 64-2207
Date: Jan 8, 1965

Mr. G2-3 contacted me on Jan 5, 1965 and advised that on Dec 26, 1964 a military policeman stationed at Ft, Knox, Kentucky had observed a strange light or object in the sky at approximately 2250 hours. The military policeman had reported his observation to his superior officer and a report was forwarded to the commanding general of Ft. Knox.
The military policeman stated that while on patrol he observed what appeared to be a very bright light in the sky to the north of his position. He stated that the light was stationary for some period of time and then began to move rapidly to the east and then to the west, making several changes in direction at high speed. The military policeman reported that the light was observed for a period of approximately 10-15 minutes and that it was brighter than any star or planet he had ever observed. He further stated that the light did not resemble any conventional aircraft with which he was familiar.
The commanding general of Ft. Knox requested an investigation of this incident and a copy of the report was forwarded to the Air Force.
I was directed to contact the military policeman who made the original observation and to obtain a detailed statement from him concerning the incident. I was also instructed to contact the commanding general of Ft. Knox and obtain any additional information he might have concerning the incident.
On Jan 6, 1965 I contacted the military policeman who had reported the observation. He reiterated the details of his original report and stated that he was certain that the light he observed was not any type of conventional aircraft. He stated that the light moved in a very erratic manner and at extremely high speeds, far in excess of any aircraft with which he was familiar.
I then contacted the commanding general of Ft. Knox and he advised me that he was very interested in this incident and requested that I forward a copy of my report to him as soon as possible. He stated that he would appreciate any additional information I could provide concerning the nature of the object observed.
This report is being forwarded for your information and further processing.

January 13, 1965...The Lieutenant Commander Family of the 3rd Armored Division, stationed at Ft. Knox, Kentucky, reported an unidentified object of 60-90 feet in diameter hovering over his residence for approximately 15 minutes on the night of 7 January 1965. The object was described as round, glowing in color, and making no sound. It illuminated the area and cast reflections. The object was observed by the witness, his wife, and two children, and was seen to depart at a very high speed.

Lights in S ky,
Auto Is Startled
Near Entered

The Kentucky Militia Officer was driving hie auto on U.S. 27 near Fort Knox, Ky., when he observed a bright light in the aky near the aorth horizon. The light appeared to be moving in a westerly direction and came to a halt near the road.
As he approached the area, the light suddenly extinguished. He drove up to the spot, and then noticed a faint glow or light about 20 feet in diameter on the ground. This light seemed to be giving off a dull, reddish glow. The officer then observed a strange metallic object about 20 to 30 feet in diameter on the ground, which appeared to be the source of the light. The object was about four feet high and seemed to be constructed of a shiny, metallic material.
The officer approached to within 50 yards of the object and then it suddenly shot up into the air and disappeared from sight. He stated that the object made no sound and left no trace on the ground.
The Kentucky Air National Guard was notified of the incident.

The text details the incident, including the sighting of a saucer-shaped object that hovered for several minutes before departing at a high rate of speed. The document mentions that multiple witnesses observed the event.

SAUCER IN SKY STILL AUTO IN VIRGINIA: Another incident in same area of Virginia occurred between the towns of Zuni and Wakefield on Route 10. At about 6:45 PM on 23 December, several men and about two children were outside their homes watching a saucer-shaped object hovering and slowly maneuvering between 1000 and 3000 feet altitude. It appeared to be about 30 to 50 feet in diameter, and seemed translucent, or lighted from within. After hovering for about 5 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated to a very high rate of speed and disappeared to the South-east in about 2 to 3 seconds. Estimated speed was several thousand miles per hour. There were several witnesses, including the Chief of Police of Wakefield, Virginia. The whole incident lasted only 15 to 20 seconds.

Mysterious Light Observed Friday Evening
MANCHESTER, N.H. - Jan. 3, 1965
According to the report from the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, several men fishing in the Piscataquog River at Manchester, N.H. on the evening of Friday, January 1, 1965, observed a mysterious light in the sky.
The report states that at about 7:45 p.m., the men noticed a strange light overhead. According to their observations, the light appeared to be round and stationary, and varied in intensity from a bright glow to a dark dull red, then back to the bright glow. This cycling of intensity reportedly continued for about 30 minutes.
The light was estimated to be about 200 feet off the ground and about 100 yards from their position. The men said the light seemed to be about the size of a basketball at arm's length.
The report concludes that the "nature of the light was unexplained." No further details are provided.

Transcript of the text in the document:

"Mystery Light
Seen After TV
Stops Working

At approximately 7:30 PM on the evening of January 7, 1965, the undersigned was watching TV in his home in Manchester, NH. The TV suddenly went off, and remained off for approximately 10-15 minutes.

Shortly after the TV went off, a bright light appeared in the room, about 4-5 feet from the TV set. The light was approximately 4 inches in diameter, and appeared to be spherical in shape. It hovered about 3 feet off the floor, and remained stationary for about 2 minutes.

The light then began to move slowly toward the wall, and as it approached the wall, it gradually dimmed, finally disappearing completely. The light seemed to have some depth to it, and gave off a faint glow, but did not illuminate the room.

The witness was alone in the room at the time, and was the only one to observe the light. He is certain that the light was not caused by any known source, and was not a reflection or an hallucination. He also noted that the light had no visible means of support, and seemed to float in mid-air.

This incident, which lasted a total of about 5 minutes, is considered to be of great interest, and may be related to similar reports of "mystery lights" observed in connection with electrical disturbances."

THOMAS C. TURNER -- WITNESS:
I was in my back yard on the night of 10 December 1964. A Luminous object, hovering high over my house, drew my attention. I watched it for about 20 minutes. The object was round, disc-shaped, with a glowing dome in the center. It seemed to be about 500-600 feet in diameter. The object was silent, moved up and down, and from side to side, without any noticeable forward motion. A Concord man reported sighting the same or a similar object at about the same time. The bright light and lower strobing lights stopped after a similar object was sighted over the hills. The downward motion and hovering led me to assume it was not an aircraft, but some sort of advanced aerial vehicle. REMARKS: This report seems to contain a good description of a typical UFO sighting. The witness is apparently reliable, and his observations are consistent with many other similar reports.

Mystery Light
Report Made
At Lakehurst

On 27 December 1964 at about 1645 hours, a mysterious light was observed in the sky near Lakehurst, New Jersey, by two soldiers from the Nike Hercules Missile Site. The light was observed for about 15 seconds, and then disappeared. The light was described as being yellow-orange in color and flashing. It was moving at a high rate of speed, and slightly descending, when it disappeared. The light seemed to be slightly larger than a star, but smaller than the moon.

The two observers, Private First Class Amos and Private First Class Barnes, both of the 9th Missile Battalion, reported this observation to their site commander, who in turn reported it to the Combat Center at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. No other sightings were reported in the area at that time. The location of the observers was about 5 miles southwest of Lakehurst Naval Air Station.

SAUCER LANDING IN VIRGINIA: A seven-page report from a "concerned citizen" was received by the Air Force on 18 January 1965 concerning a saucer landing incident which allegedly occurred in the vicinity of Ft. Knox, Kentucky on 14 March 1963.

The report states that several witnesses observed a silvery disc-shaped object, approximately 50 feet in diameter, slowly descend and land in a wooded area near the fort. After landing, several humanoid figures were seen to emerge from the craft and move around it briefly before re-entering and departing the area at a high rate of speed. The witnesses, who included military personnel, were reportedly quite shaken by the incident. 

The report further states that an extensive search of the landing site was conducted by military authorities, and some ground markings were allegedly found. However, no other physical evidence or debris was recovered.

Connecticut Has January Flap
What is the other reason some reports indicate Connecticut had more than its usual number of UFO reports this January?
On Friday, 8, at Hartford, a witness reported seeing a bright light in the sky at 5:30 p.m. Two Phillips women stated they saw the object hovering and maneuvering for about 15 minutes. They said it appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and 30 feet off the ground.
A 10-year-old Glastonbury girl reported seeing a bright light in the southwestern sky at 8 p.m. on the 20th. It had "flashing blue lights" and was about 30 feet above the ground. As it passed overhead, it made a humming sound.
An A.P. man that same evening saw a strange object with two white lights in the northeastern sky at 8 p.m. It appeared to be about 25 feet in diameter and was moving rapidly toward the east.
According to the reports, these sightings were among several investigated by the Eastern Branch of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, who on the basis of their inquiries are inclined to the view that something unusual was seen in the Connecticut sky during the last few weeks.

10-Year-Old
Reports Seeing
Flying Saucer
Corbin, Kentucky. - A 10-
year-old boy here, Hartford
Lassiter, said he saw a flying
saucer hovering over his home
Saturday night and watched it
for 15 minutes before it dis-
appeared. 
He said it was about the size
of a five-gallon bucket, was made
of "bright, shiny metal" and
floated about 20 feet above the
ground. 
The attention was attracted
to the scene by his mother and
seven-year-old sister, who also
saw the object.
"He said he could look in the
object and see something like
a man in the window, but could
not make out what it was."
Last July 16 he saw a similar
object that disappeared after
about 20 minutes, the boy report-
ed. 
The lad, his mother and sister
are all said to be highly respect-
ed in this area. The story has
caused quite a stir and some per-
sons are inclined to believe the
boy's story.
"It's his favorite subject and
it's a favorite with his schoolmates.
They like to discuss it," said his
mother.

The night sighting in a aircraft matter and received a report of that nature but could not be substantiated due to delay in reporting and fact that only one light was seen. The light appeared to be stationary for a period of time and then accelerated to a high speed, within a few seconds disappearing to the east. Estimated speed of 1500 to 2000 mph. Estimated altitude of 35,000 - 40,000 feet. The sighting was witnessed by 2 military officers and 1 civilian. PGED 5/14/65 5:52 p.m.
