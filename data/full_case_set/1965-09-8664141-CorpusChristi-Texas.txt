Jonestown RD Describe Unio Flying Object

Flying objects hovering just above the tall trees were seen by two families in the vicinity of their home at Jonestown. The two families live about a mile north of Jonestown on Route 22and both saw the strange objects at the same time.

On Saturday evening the objects were heightened as an yellow-orange in color. Mr. and Mrs. Charles S. Martin and Mr. and Mrs. Walter Shuey, who live across the road from the Martins, both watched the strange objects hovering over the top of the high pine trees. 

The objects, according to the observers, did not appear to have any surface markings and were of a definite solid shape. The objects remained stationary for some time. Mrs. Martin said, "they just hovered over the trees and then slowly moved away."

The objects moved at a slow rate of speed and then increased their speed before disappearing from sight. The observers believe the objects were under intelligent control. They said the objects were silent in operation.

MYSTERY IMPRINTS

Small imprints left in the ground were also found in the area where the unidentified flying objects were reported seen on Sunday. The imprints, both round and rectangular, seemed to have been made by the landing of some object ather than human feet. These imprints were found on the other side of the sand pile from where the flying objects were spotted.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page of text from what appears to be a Project Blue Book UFO report document. As per the instructions, I will proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Apparently there was some interference going on. Near the edge of the woods Ronald reported sighting the object. Coming out of the woods it seemed to glide and then came out of the woods in back of the house. About a few hundred yards it disappeared. The object did not make any sound. Earlier they did say out neighbors. Mr. and Mrs. They claimed to have seen something. The report was apparently made in the standard manner. As usual nothing was on the face of the house. Watermeyer family reported that no unusual prints or marks appeared on the lawn or house and that no strange odor was noticed. Except for the unusual "look" and "hand prints" at the trees, their report seemed to be straightforward and reasonable in view of the circumstances. Apparently traces of the incident were later found which seemed to indicate the presence of "humanoid" type creatures. Traces taken of the apparent landing site further substantiated this. However, Watermeyer was unable to furnish any additional information concerning the size, shape, or number of these creature traces or prints. As previously stated, no such marks or prints were found around the house or on the lawn itself.

The image contains a newspaper article with the headline "Sunday's Saucer Was Blimp; What Was Last Night's?". The article describes a reported UFO sighting on Sunday night, where the object was later determined to have been a blimp. The article also mentions another reported UFO sighting the previous night, the details of which are not yet known.

LEBANON, PA., THURSDAY EVENING, SEPTEMBER 23, 1965
Another UFO Sighting
Sunday's Saucer Was Blimp; What Was Last Night's?
Those unidentified flying objects (UFOs) sighted in the downtown area Sunday evening apparently were nothing more than a blimp, it was learned today.
A blimp, flying at a low altitude, was sighted by numerous persons in the Lebanon area Sunday night. In fact, it was so low that it seemed to be just a few hundred feet off the ground.
None of these UFOs were known to be aircraft, according to Air Force officials. They viewed the object through powerful telescopes, and it appeared to be a blimp.
This blimp, on duty Sunday night, told the Lebanon Daily News that Sunday night's sighting was a false alarm. Meanwhile, about 20 people saw another UFO the night before, but its identity remains unknown.
Larry Ives, 201 N. Penn Ave., Palmyra, who spotted the blimp Sunday night, told The Lebanon Daily News that he had studied the object through binoculars and definitely identified it as a blimp.
The two persons who were driving in a car on North Ninth Street, seen the blimp seem to move slowly toward the ground, but Ives said it actually appeared to be coming nearer the ground on a field in South Annville.
The Harrisburg airport reports that the blimp was passing through this area about 9:30 Sunday night, so this apparently solves the mystery of Sunday's "unidentified flying object."
But what about Friday night's sighting? That still remains a mystery, with no explanation given so far. Airport officials said they knew of no aircraft or other objects being in the skies over Lebanon at that time.
"I don't know what it was," said one man who spotted the thing Friday night. "It was big and bright green and white lights twinkling on it."

He said it hovered over the goverment area about 15 miles wide at about 15 to 20 miles an hour. Several said the speed was felt to be around 100 miles per hour.
Sunday Night Sighting
Dallas, Texas, 7:50 P M Citizen George F. Cornet, his wife, and two children, aged 4 and 6 years old, were driving about 10 to 15 miles west of Corpus Christi on highway 44. They said they saw an object about 30 feet in diameter appear out of the clouds about 20 degrees above the horizon. This was to the east. They said the object seemed to be revolving or spinning as it hovered over the area. When Mr. Cornet stopped the car and got out to get a better look, the object then began to descend toward the ground. He said he was able to see the bottom of the object before it disappeared behind trees and power lines. He reported his sighting the next day, September 5, to the Corpus Christi Air Force Base.
The police, which appeared to be disinterested in the report, said they had received several other calls on this incident. The object was described as being around 30 feet in diameter, and about 4 to 5 years old. Browns said he was on his return trip home from fishing all day, and was about 20 to 25 miles southwest of Corpus Christi when he saw the object. He said it appeared to be 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and was hovering about 30 to 50 feet off the ground. He said he watched it for about 15 to 20 minutes before it began to move off to the southwest, increasing in speed as it went. The area where the object was seen is just outside the south Gate to the Kingsville Naval Air Station.

SUMMARY:
Unidentified flying object-Continued to be reported as irregular in form. Report contains an eye witness account by one of the Chilean National Air Force pilots. The report indicates the object was in sight for several minutes and was observed to change color from white to red and then back to white. Sensational declarations made by the pilot to the Chilean newspaper. Chief of LAN declares this was something very extraordinary. He said this was not precisely a machine but rather a projection of light. The object maneuvered evasively and left at tremendous speed.

CIASS: As all the crew members saw a strange flying object in Aries on 26 August 1965 and the previous declarations made by some of them, it was decided to identity their experience.    

I saw the object approximately at 15.30 hours in Aries and it was a brilliant star-like object yellowish-white in color and had a strange flickering effect. It oscillated and then It disappeared very rapidly, traveling in a northerly direction. I saw it for approximately 2 minutes and I do not believe it was a meteorite. I am Capt. O'Neill, DC 65 LAN FLT. #901 as Chief of Flight Operations. I have never had a similar experience in all my years of flying.  I didn't believe in "THEM" until I saw this. 
The speed of 500 - 600 knots. The night was cloudy and without stars -- the object was not part of the atmosphere. I could not be identified as a planet, star, or satellite. It was not affected by the atmosphere and I observed it at a distance of about 30 miles. Suddenly it disappeared at a tremendous speed, without leaving any trails.

CHILE- 
The pilot who allegedly saw the UFO was interviewed by L. Nacinr when he returned home from the president's office.
Comments: Many sightings have been reported in the northern area of Chile. Special conditions in the atmosphere and meteorological factors may account for an unusually large number of sightings. To the observer's advantage, the area in question is sparsely populated, fortunate enough to catch sight of one.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a text-based description of a "street sighting" incident. The text describes the reported sighting of an unidentified flying object by multiple witnesses in Corpus Christi, Texas on September 6, 1965.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed using OCR:

The Hrmac City, Corpus Christi, Texas, 6 Sep 65.
Witnesses: Mr. & Mrs. Rene Brizuel, 1109 S. Alameda St., Corpus Christi, Texas, who reported the sighting to a newspaper reporter, KIII-TV News, Corpus Christi, Texas.
At approximately 2000 hrs, 6 Sep 65, the witnesses observed a large, bright, pulsating light in the sky traveling in a straight line from east to west at a high rate of speed. The object was visible for approximately 30 seconds. No noise was heard. The object was reported to be much larger and brighter than any aircraft the witnesses had previously seen.

The image does not contain any visible photograph. The document appears to be a report from Project Blue Book, describing an incident involving a near-collision of a Chilean plane with a UFO on the night of September 6th, 1965. The report details that the UFO was sighted at a distance, and the incident resulted in a collision course. However, the UFO soon disappeared, and the Chilean plane was able to continue its flight without further incident. The report states that the unidentified object was soon lost from sight, and that there was no such plane - the unidentified object soon closed up and disappeared under the craft. Overall, the document appears to be a written report from Project Blue Book, describing this UFO incident, without any accompanying photographs.

NEAR-COLLISION OF A CHILEAN PLANE WITH A UFO

On the night of September 6th, an airplane of the Chilean National Airlines spent two anxious min utes in a near-collision with an unidentified flying object while en route from Antofagasta to Santiago.

The pilot reported that he first saw the UFO at a distance. It appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and on a collision course. He took evasive action but the UFO passed within a few hundred yards of his plane. The encounter lasted only a few seconds.

After the incident the pilot reported that he had requested Santiago to contact the control tower at Rio Hondo to check on any other air traffic in the vicinity. He was told there was no other traffic. The UFO disappeared from view immediately after the near-miss.

It was reported that there was no physical damage to the Chilean plane. The unidentified object soon closed up and disappeared under the plane when it was in a higher altitude, and the pilot continued on his way without further incident. For fear of panic, however, the UFO was not sighted in full by the passengers although they sensed "something unusual" was going on. The details of the incident were reportedly released subsequent to an urgent meeting of the directors of the Chilean National Airlines after the return of the plane to Santiago.

But Argentina, still seems to be the favorite haunt of the mysterious UFOs. A story published General Pico, La Pampa, Argentina - dated September 6 1965,
mentions one observed on that date. It states that on the night of September 6th, at approximately five o'clock in the morning when the incident occurred. The light was a high intensity light and appeared for about an interval of two or three minutes, it was basically a white light, with incandescent reddish-orange hues, it was so bright that it lighted up the surrounding countryside. After a little while later it came back and again showed its dazzling light to a top.

Flying Headlights

A number of people who have seen the bright lights of flying saucers actually make the mistake of referring to them as "flying headlights." They say the lights were similar to a car's headlights, except that no car body was visible. In many cases, what they saw were simply disc-shaped craft showing only their lights, with no visible structural details. Because these craft show little or no outline, and because their lights are so intense, they do seem very much like large headlights in the night sky. Those who have seen this type of UFO describe the lights as being round, oval, or slightly elongated, usually two in number, and sometimes blinking on and off. The size of the lights reportedly ranges from just a few feet across to as much as 30 or 40 feet in diameter. The lights are said to be so brilliant that they light up the entire surrounding area.

From the Sidnig Times of September 17, 1965, came the following report:
"A local family in the Graham's Town, Grahamstown, area on the night of September 17 saw a strange light in the sky. It was in the shape of a mushroom and was glowing. It was just like a silver or white balloon expanding and contracting in size, and appeared to be traveling at a very high speed, according to their account."

LANDING IN BRAZIL: On 10 September 1965 an incident, on territory, but in which no landing (sic) taking place, was reported. A farmer, who was working in the fields, observed a bright object land at a distance of approximately 200 meters from his position. The object was about 15 meters in diameter, bell-shaped, and while landing and talking among themselves, the occupants were observed through field glasses. After a short time, the object took off, ascending vertically, and disappeared over the horizon. In the area where the object landed, burns in the vegetation were found, as well as impressions on the ground.
There being no other evidence to corroborate the incident, the case is being treated as a possible landing by unidentified flying objects, but their occupants could not be identified.

The objects were described as being about 250 meters in diameter, and the inhabitants also found a kind of "soldier's water-bottle" near the objects. There are also mentions of other physical evidence found near the site, such as pieces of a substance resembling glass. The report states that the objects seemed to have landed in the district a few days prior to the incident being reported.

SAUCER LANDING IN SOUTH AFRICA: In the first important UFO report from South Africa, an object is seen to land on a main highway near the capital city. The object landed briefly and then took off again, leaving behind a circular impression on the road surface and vegetation apparently scorched.
The object was reported by several persons who examined the spot where the incident occurred. Grass on both sides of the highway was burned, indicating that the object had been resting on the ground. It was stated that the object was cylindrical in shape, silvery in color, and about 30 feet in diameter.

Triangular UFO Over Valladolid
Our contributor is a nun-in-Waiting at the Dominicos College in Valladolid, in Spain.

YESTERDAY AT 8:25 P.M. (September 7, 1965) the nun was sitting in the church sacristy of the college, when through a window she saw a triangular-shaped object pass directly over our school. A father and a brother, who were in the sacristy at the time also saw the object.

According to the nun's description, the object was completely silent, and about the size of a car. It was a dull, dark color and seemed to be metallic. The object moved very slowly and smoothly, without making the slightest noise. It passed over the college and disappeared towards the northeast.

The nun said that what she saw was so unusual that she immediately called the attention of the father and the brother who were in the sacristy. They also saw the object and were amazed at its strange appearance and behavior. The nun stated that she had never seen anything like it before.

We all think that this was a genuine UFO sighting. At 7:55 p.m., the UFO began to be seen, and it disappeared at 8:00 p.m. What a pity it did not come down, otherwise we would have had a splendid opportunity to examine it more closely.

The top surface was dome-shaped and had a dark, dull finish. The bottom surface was flat and gleaming. The craft appeared to be hovering at treetop level. 
Behavior: The craft was observed to be ascending and descending slowly, and moving east to west very fast.
Remark: The witness is an employee of Rocketdyne, and thanks for consideration.

A NEW NOISE

An add from Jimmy Gurlier came me the story of Mrs. Glenn McLain, who was visiting the area from her home in Corpus Christ during the Thanksgiving holidays in 1964 when she heard a strange noise which awakened her about 3:30 a.m. 

Mrs. McLain's attention was attracted by a sound described as a "hissing roar" which seemed to come from outside her motel room. She went to the window and saw nothing unusual, but the sound continued for some time. She was afraid to open the door, fearing the sound might be that of an airplane about to crash. 

Mrs. McLain could not sleep after the incident and she reported it to the motel management the following morning. The manager stated that no other guests had reported hearing any unusual sounds.

Two mysteries
The Daily Mail of September 28 reports that an unidentified flying object was sighted over Corpus Christi, Texas, on the evening of September 19. Two students reported seeing a strange bright light in the sky, hovering and then darting rapidly away. The "object" appeared to be making a humming sound, and was seen for about 15 minutes.

A few days later, on September 23, another sighting was reported in the same area. This time two young men saw a "huge bright object in the sky" which appeared to be moving slowly and silently. It was in sight for about 10 minutes.

G.P. Brame, reporting the incidents, states that "both reports have the ring of truth about them." There has been no explanation from the authorities.

Nightness car ride near Warmister, England

The writer, 12, with three others (names given) were driving from Bristol to Warminster when they saw an object in the sky. The writer describes this object as "one of the most amazing things I have ever seen." It appeared to be a large, glowing object, bright enough to light up the whole countryside around them, and it was moving very slowly across the sky. It finally descended rapidly, passed just over their car at a height estimated at about 100 feet, and then shot up into the air again at tremendous speed.

After these maneuvers it had disappeared completely, and they could see nothing further. It was reported that 30-40 people also saw the object and reacted in much the same manner - some were quite frightened by it. It was watched for about 5 minutes, and during this period the 1,000 car speedometer registered absolutely no movement, although the car was running.

The Langenhoe Incident
By Dr. Bernard E. Finch

On September 4, 1965, a very interesting sighting occurred near Langenhoe, a small town in Essex, England. This incident was witnessed by an intelligent engineer by the name of Paul Green, and it is his eyewitness account that follows.

Approximately 8:35 P.M. on the evening of September 4, 1965, I drove home from a business trip. As I approached a country road near Langenhoe, I saw a bright clear light in the sky that appeared to be coming down rapidly towards me. The light was pacing my car and kept altering its direction from over Langenhoe and then towards me. 

As I approached the straight road south to Langenhoe, I slowed down and watched this approaching bright light. It seemed to hover over the road, then suddenly darted down and appeared to come to rest on the ground approximately a quarter of a mile ahead. I drove on slowly, as I wanted to get a closer look at this phenomenon.

As I got nearer it appeared to be a large oval object, silver in color, about sixty to eighty feet in diameter. A beam of light was shining down from the underside of the object illuminating the ground below. The object was rotating slowly, almost imperceptibly, whilst the beam of light seemed to scan the area it was illuminating.

Suddenly the light went out, and the object shot straight up into the sky disappearing in a flash. I continued on, but could see no trace of where it had landed. The whole incident lasted approximately five minutes. Later I reported the incident to the police.

Two policemen see saucer on main road

On the night of from 15 Sep 65, two policemen were driving on the national road near the VADERLAND when they noticed a bright light in the sky. They stopped to investigate and saw a saucer-shaped object hovering above the road. 

The two policemen said that they had been sent to investigate when a call was made to their office. They saw the object for some time before it sped off faster than they had ever seen anything move. It was emphatic that there had been no sound. The object then disappeared in a flash of light.

The C.S.I.R. was requested to take samples of the charred grass where the object had landed, but there was no sound. 

The two constables said that they had been sent to investigate when a call was made to their office. There was no sound.

"Spokesman for the C.S.I.R. to comment that it appears could not have been propelled by con- trolled agencies. 
"Long after the object had vanished the far on the horizon, the flames kept burning. The flames kept to a short distance above the surface of the earth and resembled a child's toy top and a farm wagon, which was continuously associated with flying saucers. I have thoroughly investigated the case, but cannot find any reasonable explanation to account for what was seen and observed, but after this I shall be the first to admit that such things are real. The object left no trace and there was no sign of heat. They saw no sign of life, however, nor was there any sound." 

"The constables state emphatically that the object was silent and without motion. They say it was distinctly visible in the light. They say that when daylight appeared, the "strange machine" had disappeared without a trace. They saw no smoke or flame.

"The people of Corpus Christi are greatly puzzled by this latest incident, which they say is clearly unusual. It does not indicate that something unusual has happened and that the rumors of unidentified flying objects stirring alarms and causing commotion as to be expected as the flames had died out shortly after the object had disappeared and the sky was clear." 

Both constables stated emphatically that the object was "buckled." Both constables stated emphatically that the machine came to rest in the field and they saw no signs of it having taken off. 

In a patch where the flames coming from the object were clearly visible, they found no trace of burning, and the surface was badly scorched. A large black patch, perhaps 6 ft. in diameter, was left on the ground. There were no indications of any landing gear or landing gear marks, no disturbance of the ground inside the white line in the middle of the patch.

At the scene of the incident, the constables and the Fire Depart-ment, spent over 2 hours searching the area. They found nothing, no trace, no evidence whatsoever.

The report states that the Police Department, including the Sheriff's Office, have had numerous reports of "Flying Saucers" in that general vicinity over a period of several years, but this was the first time an actual landing had been reported and confirmed by the authorities.

INITIAL REPORT:
Hanning object" takes off from the road while they were proceeding home, two witnesses reported. The object showed that the road surface where they saw it ascending was very bright, and they saw a puff of white smoke or steam just after it took off.

Two young residents in the area - a husband and wife - reported seeing a bright unknown object take off from the road about a few hundred yards from their home. Residents in the area were excited by the report and the Civil Aviation Administration office in Corpus Christi took the report. Nothing suspicious was reported from any other sources.

Visual Evidence:
The two couples were interviewed on the night (September 17) they were informed that they were interviewed, and they reaffirmed their report as made. They were told that their stories were being taken seriously because no reasonable explanation could be found. The sighting was described as a bright flying object take off from the road and disappear In a bright flash.

STARTLING CONTACTEE STORY FROM 1951 RECENTLY REVEALED: Barney and Betty Hill, of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, made headlines back in 1961 when they told a bizarre story of being kidnapped and examined by a band of humanoid beings. Now, some additional details have come to light on a similar case which took place in 1951 out in the Southwest. 

New Hampshire's white mountains on their way back from a trip to Canada, the Hills observed a disc-shaped UFO following them. They became convinced that they had suffered a strange encounter sometime during their trip, but the details had been almost completely blotted from their minds by a process of hypnotic amnesia. In a series of hypnotic sessions, the Hills were able to recover a memory of being taken inside the UFO and subjected to what seemed to be a thorough physical examination by humanoid creatures.

Similarly, there was a couple in the Southwest back in 1951 who had an almost identical experience, and there is physical evidence to the effect from that case too. The person involved made a tentative report about the incident at the time, but apparently the information was discouraged and the case was effectively buried and forgotten. Some years later, working with a sympathetic mental health professional, the persons concerned in this earlier case were able to piece together what had happened to them under hypnosis, and the results are very similar to the Hill case.

On a starry night in 1951, the husband and wife were driving back from an errand. Suddenly they noticed a strange aerial object approaching them at low altitude. As it drew nearer, it became clear that this was no ordinary aircraft. The object was a huge, elliptical-shaped craft, about 60 feet in diameter, with a central dome. Bathed in a soft glow, it made no sound as it hovered silently over their car for several minutes. 

Terrified, the couple watched as a beam of bluish-white light suddenly shot from the craft and enveloped their car. They were then drawn upward into the interior of the UFO. There, they encountered a group of bizarre humanoid creatures - about 5 feet tall, with large heads, pointed chins, and large, luminous eyes. They seemed to communicate with their minds. 

The couple were then subjected to what seemed to be a thorough medical examination, including the taking of tissue and blood samples. Afterwards, they were returned to their car - dazed, confused, and missing over 2 hours of time. 

The physical after-effects were strikingly similar to those reported by the Hills: both experienced a tingling sensation in the body, skin discoloration, and mysterious linear markings. The husband also found a small, metallic object implanted in his body, which was subsequently removed by a physician.

Apparently, the couple was so frightened and bewildered by their experience that they were reluctant to report it. It was only years later, when the Hill case was publicized, that they finally felt able to come forward and recount their own strange encounter. They have since undergone hypnotic regression, and the details of their experience are said to be consistent with the Hill case.
