UNCLASSIFIED AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

CANADA 
HARMON A.F.B., NEWFOUNDLAND 
28 January 1953 
28 January 1953

OBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object ("Bright Light")

1. On 23 January 1953 at approximately 1945 hours, a bright light was observed by CAPTAIN, USAF, Harwell, some officers and enlisted men, Harmon AFB.

2. The object was visually observed for about 10 minutes as an approximate 1" diameter object with no apparent trail or exhaust.

3. While some observers estimated the distance of the object from the station to be 25 miles, others felt it could be as close as 10 miles. The object disappeared to the northeast.

4. Instrument readings indicated that the light was not steady, but flickered at variable rates of speed.

5. Although the light was visually observed, no other phenomena of the light was reported.

6. All observers concurred that the light had the characteristics of either a very bright star or a celestial body.

7. Weather at 02302 23 January as reported by the local Weather Department indicated gusty winds to 20,000 feet with visibility 10 miles. The moon was in the first quarter.

COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICER:
1. The planet Venus (Magnitude 4.3) was located on a true bearing of 260 degrees at an elevation of 55 degrees above the horizon at the time of the incident.
2. It is considered probable that the light reported in this incident was caused by the reflection and movement of Venus and was not an unidentified flying object.
