Subject: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

Dear Sirs:

I have been reading articles in various newspapers concerning your interest in the investigation by a Committee of the Congress to prove the UFO sightings in Michigan and other parts of the nation.

Both my husband and myself had occasions, four years ago, of witnessing the same flying object, lasting approximately 45 minutes, to what we seemed to be a large, very bright, shiny metallic object, hovering over our home near Carpentersville, Illinois, though we should advise you of what we saw. The following:
Four years ago, my husband and I were on a fishing vacation at Ox Bow Lake, near Presque Isle, Wisconsin-Michigan border. We noticed a large, bright object hovering over the Highland woods, some 8 miles away. It was shaped like a football, and as we were watching it, it suddenly took off at a fantastic speed, and was gone. This occurred about 10:30 P.M.; it was completely dark, but the sky was very clear, which was ideal for such observation.

I was looking straight out over the expanse of water and sky, when suddenly appearing from the direction of Escanaba, Michigan, was a very bright and large, sparkling, glittering object. Based on a spiral very speedy course, it was mid-way between the horizon and our viewpoint. It was one of the most magnificent sights we have ever seen. As soon as it came into view, just as suddenly, it was gone. We could not understand or explain this, and then suddenly all was dark; it was dark in a flash, but did not fade out of our sight; it just became absolutely dark. We were very puzzled about this bright light at the end when it suddenly was nothing as when I first sighted it.

This bright, starlike phenomena was very close to us; and it seemed illuminated and aglow like a football or sun-fish, was very good-sized. It was shiny like a mirror and seemed to flashing or sparkling. Its color was at times copper, green and gold. It remained still for some time, in a stationary position, then suddenly took off at a fantastic speed and was gone. This was hard for us to fathom; it seemed so close, yet it disappeared so quickly. We do not believe under any circumstances that we saw a natural phenomenon, or a meteor. We are convinced that this is something strange and unusual, beyond the reactions of any known aircraft, and possesses self-controlled course, straight, and had all the aspects of a controlled flying object.

We would appreciate your acknowledging this letter and information sent you. Thanking you, we are,

Yours Truly,
Major Hector Quintanilla, Chief of the Project Blue Book Office
Colonel Richard H. Bolley
Dayton, Ohio

NO. Case (Information Only) 
3 January 1962 
Woonsocket, Rhode Island

Jan. 2 - Mr. ___ reported three maneuvering lights observed near Pawtucket Dye Works Plant, along with many other observers. During 1962, I was able to uncover two top UFO stories, which never would have reached the news wires, had I not made sure they were followed to proper conclusions. These two reports were only two of many that I personally received and investigated. There had been a number of sightings and incidents reported from the Woonsocket area during this period. 

LT. These two reports concerned the sighting of three discs that maneuvered over Woonsocket, Rhode Island and were sighted by Mr. ___ and a group of other eyewitnesses on January 3, 1962.

Jamaica
JAMAICA:
Many visits
Some of the accounts that have been received from Jamaica
indicate a large number of unidentified flying objects have
been reported over that island during recent months. The
reports indicate that the sightings are not confined to any
one section but are scattered over the entire island.
One of the contributors, writing from Mandeville, states that
on several occasions he has seen UFO's over that town. On
one occasion, he reports, a bright white light, much brighter
than he could account for as an aircraft, was observed hover-
ing in the sky for approximately 30 minutes. The object was
estimated to be about 45 to 50 feet in diameter. On other
occasions, discs and other types of UFOs have been sighted.
Another observer, writing from Montego Bay, states that he
and his wife were awakened one night about 12:30 a.m. by a
brilliant light shining through their bedroom window. They
observed a large, brilliantly lighted object hovering about
200 feet above the ground. It remained in view for about 15
minutes and then suddenly shot upward at a terrific speed
and disappeared. The witness states that the object appeared
to be approximately 75 to 100 feet in diameter.
It would appear from these and other reports received that
Jamaica is experiencing an unusually high incidence of UFO
sightings at the present time. The reports received indicate
that the objects being observed are of several different types
and sizes, but all apparently are displaying characteristics
that clearly distinguish them from known aircraft or other
conventional aerial objects.
