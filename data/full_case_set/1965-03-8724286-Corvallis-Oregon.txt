BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Two witnesses reported observing an unidentified object in the sky for approximately 10 minutes. The object was described as bright and metallic in appearance, maneuvering with quick, darting movements. No sound was heard. Due to the object's unusual behavior and lack of identification, the conclusion is that this was an UNIDENTIFIED sighting.

CORVALLIS, OREGON
4 MARCH 1955

Two observers, a driver and a passenger, in an automobile, were driving slowly on Toria Road, southeast of Corvallis, Oregon, when they sighted three lights, similar to roman candles, rising from the ground, several seconds apart. The lights appeared as yellow balls, about the size of a tennis ball and emitting a light. The flight path was almost straight up to an altitude of about 200 feet where it disappeared.

Observer stated that on the next day he went back to the area where the object was spotted and there was a dark spot on the ground. There were no other visible tracks or markings to the observer. The observer obtained a dirt sample from the darker areas in his field.

COMMENTS
Although the sighting is similar to a fireworks display, no evidence was uncovered that anyone was shooting flares or fireworks. Meteorological personnel and personnel of the Portland Air Defense Sector have revealed no correlation of this sighting with known air activity or natural phenomena. An analysis of the dirt indicated it contained a petroleum hydrocarbon base oil and no additional chemicals, such as nitrates or sulfur. Considering the information available, there is no explanation for the alleged sighting and the case is carried as unidentified.

SUBMITTED BY: FTD (Sgt. Moody)

I. PURPOSE:
To analyse the sample for organic components that would be foreign to earth samples.

II. FACTUAL DATA:
A sample of dirt was submitted to the Analytical Branch and assigned analysis branch number 35-53. An analysis (Marsh extract) was extracted with carbon tetrachloride and an infrared spectrum obtained. The spectrum showed the residue to be a typical hydrocarbon, similar to petroleum. The amount of oil extracted was on the order of 1%.

III. CONCLUSIONS:
The dirt sample was analyzed and found to contain a petroleum hydrocarbon base oil.
