MEMO FOR THE RECORD: 19 October 1965
SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING: 17 Oct 65.
The witness, an unidentified woman, Dayton, Ohio, observed an unidentified object on the night of 17 October 65 between 11:35pm - 11:45pm, observed for 10-15 minutes, object looked like it was a star. Noticed it because it was weaving and went up and down, was in the Northeast, she couldn't really tell the direction. Did not look like an airplane. She said that maybe if she went out again she could tell the direction. I asked if we could send her a form to fill out. She asked that we also send a form for her friend who observed object with her. Forms were sent to her on 19 Oct 65.
Checked EGRO I & II, PEGASUS, F.I.T. & III schedules (negative)

The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page appears to be a questionnaire or form filled out with information about a reported UFO sighting.

Text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
The object was visible for several minutes at a steady rate of descent until it disappeared into the haze and distance.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

16. Did the object move in front of anything at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle one): Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound Very still and silent
b. Color Greenish white, slightly luminous

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and mark how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
The object appeared to be approximately 1/8 the size of the full moon, so the match head would have covered a small portion of the object.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially indicate trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
(The witness has provided a hand-drawn sketch with an arrow indicating the direction of motion.)
