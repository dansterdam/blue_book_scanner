September 23, 1967

Major Hector Quintanilla 
Project Blue Book

Dear Major Quintanilla,

I am writing to report concerning two U.F.O.'s which I witnessed on the night of 3 September 1967. The objects were of a group of about 8 to 10 and were about 200 feet in diameter. And were sighted in 
the southern sky just after dusk. And were stationary for some time.

Then about 7:19 P.M. O.C.T. the objects began to move, at first very slowly and then increased in speed rapidly.
The objects traveled at a tremendous rate of speed in a westerly direction.
The strange thing which I noticed was that there appeared to be a control tower or antenna-like structure on top of the objects. I do not know whether this was some type of guidance system or
what its purpose was. That is about all I can recall concerning this sighting.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

P.S. There were 5 other witnesses of these objects.

September 23, 1964

Major Hector Quintanilla
Project Blue Book

Dear major Quintanilla,
I am writing to inform you concerning two U.F.O.'s which I observed on the night of September 21, 1964. The objects were observed through 7x50 binoculars and were large and bright. And were sighted in the Nashville area just after dark, approximately 19:30 PM. The objects remained stationary for over an hour and then suddenly darted away at a high rate of speed.
The report is being submitted to you for any action you may deem necessary. The objects traveled at a very fast speed and then suddenly stopped. It is assumed that they were under intelligent control as the speed and maneuvers were far beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. But I assure you that this report is not motivated by any type of sensationalism. I am simply reporting what I actually saw.

P.S. There were 3 other witnesses of these objects.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 16 October 1967

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I wish to know but do not know what the objects were. They seemed to travel at artificial satellite velocities which I have observed before. 

Amongst the other observers say they saw material a little differently but I must assure you the observation was very strange.

The image contains two drawings. The larger drawing is a compass rose, with directions labeled around the perimeter. The smaller drawings appear to be sketches showing the positioning of a phenomenon relative to the observer, with instructions on how to complete the drawing.

Here is the text from the document, transcribed as requested:

SA. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE COURSE OF THE PHENOMENON. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.
