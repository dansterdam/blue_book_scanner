STATEMENT
At approximately 0235Z, the Base operator at Lockbourne Control Tower stated that the Franklin County Sheriff's Office phoned and wished to talk with us. The tower accepted the phone call from the Licking County Sheriff's Office and advised of the report of a UFO sighting from there. A deputy sheriff from this county had spotted a high speed object moving in an east-west direction.
The UFO was reported as having no tail and gradually faded out. The tower observed a bright object fast of this. But the controller's visibility was limited due to some haze. At the same time, 3107, C-47 type aircraft was airborne and was asked if possible to identify the object.
The aircraft Commander of C-3107 advised not positively identify the object as an aircraft. Detroit Air Defense Sector was notified of the object in Lockbourne area.

STATEMENT

(UFO SIGHTING)

I observed an UFO about 20-30 degrees above the horizon, which was white in color and traveling at a high rate of speed in an easterly direction. As it made a tight turn towards the west, tracking it with my eyes, the UFO faded out and disappeared.

I observed no navigational lights, no grime, "red", and no other distinguishing features, but it gave off an appearance of two bright white lights.

The observation was passed to the tower authorities.

I swear this to be a true statement of the incident this 23rd day of September 1965.

STATEMENT

(THIS STANDING)

At approximately 0235Z, I observed a white round object east of
Lockbourne AFB heading southwest. Over the SW of Lockbourne, the object then
went behind some low clouds. At that time, a dark gray elongated cylindrical
object for possible identification.

I no longer observed the object due to the fact that it was working
at the local communications and this position required more immediate attention.
