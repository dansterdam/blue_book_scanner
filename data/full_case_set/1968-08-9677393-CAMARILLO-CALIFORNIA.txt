PROJECT 10079 RECORD
1. DATE-TIME GROUP 29/07/1968
2. LOCATION CAMARILLO, CALIFORNIA
3. SOURCE CIVILIAN
4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS 1
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION 9 SECONDS
6. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observers at one point described the light as brightly illuminating a large flat object, somewhat larger than a 100 foot airliner. No mention is made if there were any marks or not. Also, the object is described as giving the appearance of 100 feet in diameter but it could have been considerably larger. The sighting may have been of a plane, a meteor, or a UFO as given in AFR 80-17. All that can be said is that there is not enough information to determine what the light was attached to.
10. CONCLUSION
INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVALUATION

APR 60 -17(C
A NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE PRINT OF ANY ITEM, EVENT, OR ACTIVITY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE IS ATTACHED AND MARKED ACCORDINGLY.

The text in the document reads:
"Continuous lights in the sky, possibly minature 20-30' above the ground, showing small signs of movement, rapidly shifting in a sharp descent, and hovering for quite some time. Had light havening under its way for about 30 minutes, in a shape of a diamond and rounded at the ends. It seemed to be in a stabilized position, moving only to descend and ascend again. When watched it moved slowly, moving in a jerking motion (possibly) taking still in a curved line. It would be impossible to estimate its size, but it was not consistent to be any known airborne object. It moved in a pattern unknown to me, and when observing it, it seemed to disappear from sight."

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

CAMERA VIEWED: BINOCULAR
FOCAL LENGTH: 
SHUTTER SPEED: 
DISTANCE OF WITNESS FROM OBJECT: 
ESTIMATE OF SIZE OF OBJECT: LEVEL FLIGHT (LEVEL)SPEED OF THE OBJECT: 
ESTIMATE OF ANGULAR VELOCITY: SO SLOW THAT I COULD NOT FOLLOW IT WITH CAMERA. DAZZLING AND BRIGHT LIKE VERY INTENSE LIGHT. 
WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE DISTANCE FROM YOU TO THE OBJECT? APPEARED TO BE SOME DISTANCE BUT COULD NOT JUDGE ACCURATELY.
WHAT WERE THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT DETAILS OF COLOR, SHAPE, AND MOTION THAT YOU NOTED? SEEMED TO BE OF BRIGHT METALLIC MATERIAL WHICH APPEARED NEARLY WHITE. MOVEMENT WAS VERY SLOW AND LEVEL AND STEADY.

Along with the image, this would also be the output from the OCR system.
