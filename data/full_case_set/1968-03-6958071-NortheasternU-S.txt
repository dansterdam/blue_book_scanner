Output of the text contained in the document:

Across the eastern United States, from Northern Tennessee to north eastern Pennsylvania, Sunday evening, 3 March 1968, was clear and cold. The sighting, as the duty officer of the eastern Pennsylvania district controller's office, Edwards Air Force Base, told me, was reported by three observers, John R. Wilson of Alexandria, Pennsylvania, Dade City, Florida, and his wife who saw the objects from their farm about 15 miles southwest of Dade City, Florida. At approximately 8.15 pm. John R. Wilson, the informant, saw three bright lights in the sky, traveling in a southeasterly direction. They were in a tight line formation. At first, Mr. Wilson thought they were stars, but as they approached, he could see that they were not. They were about 30 degrees above the horizon. As they approached, Mr. Wilson said, "like a single small white light in the sky ahead" of the observer the objects suddenly changed direction and sped away at a tremendous rate of speed. So fast, in fact, that it did not blink! It was so constant. As it approached, it grew larger and looked like the "whole of a plane". Then about the same time, Mr. Wilson thought, the whole object or objects grew dimmer. Then directly behind the first object came a second. Then directly behind the second, there was a third. They weren't planes, they weren't even bright. The first one was a little brighter than the other two. According to the times given, this sighting lasted three to four minutes. At times the length of the objects, it was a beautiful sight to behold and the wonder was that, with all this speed, there was no sound.

About the same time on the outskirts of Daley Springs, Nebraska, two people described that he saw an object, due east about 40 to 50 degrees above the horizon. Mr. Daley described this object as a "small American-type jet' as it passed over going in a northeasterly direction. The object was about the size of a B-29 bomber. The "American Association of Variable Star Observers" were in session three miles, closer together, he wrote. The leading one was about 30 feet in front of the others, which were about 30 feet apart. The three objects were of equal brightness. The American Association of Variable Star Observers were three yards like objects, close together, "The leading one was about 30 feet in front of the others, which were about 30 feet apart. The three objects were of equal brightness, brilliance scale. The first one seemed to get smaller than the others, to slow down then to increase speed, to get larger then to get smaller, then to disappear like a meteor". He lost sight of the objects when they were within five degrees of the horizon.

These accounts and others like them--about a couple of dozen in all--came in a tiny corner of the United States on 3 March 1968--in the three-quarter of an organization known as the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). 10 accounts of this particular incident on 3 March 1968 are in the Central Phenomena Office of the United States Air Force at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.

It is now apparent that the March phenomena was part of a much larger series of sightings that came later in the year, through the spring and summer, along the entire United States. Union's satellite Zond II--an apparently abortive moon probe, Zond II, was launched on September 30, 1965. The satellite, after a flight of 660,000 miles, entered the earth's atmosphere and it was announced it had been placed in a parking orbit until it would be position for launching further into the earth. The assumption was that the satellite was intended to travel to the environment of the Moon so maneuvering into a parking orbit, waiting for the right launching conditions, and of a rendezvous with the moon on Sunday night at approximately 0245 or 0345 GMT. However, it never reached its parking orbit. It was evidently forced down along the eastern area of the United States. It presumably landed somewhere on the eastern coast of the United States. It is believed that this activity prompted a great many of the sightings of UFOs that came into Project Blue Book during this period.

27. INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT BUT WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTERNATELY, PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING:
The sighting I saw occurred on March 21, 1968 between 17:53 and 18:02 hours in the vicinity of Northeastem University, Boston, Massachusetts. The object was first noticed by a fellow student who called my attention to it. I then observed the object for approximately 9 minutes.
The object appeared to be about the size of a basketball at arm's length, oval in shape, with a silvery metallic exterior. It was observed to be hovering stationary at an estimated altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 feet. No wings, fins, or other appendages were visible.
The object appeared to be emitting a fluorescent glow which seemed to pulse or fluctuate at an irregular rate. During my observation, the object remained stationary and did not move from its original position in the sky. There was no sound or trail associated with the object.
At one point during the sighting, the object appeared to be surrounded by a faint halo or "corona" which was visible for a brief period.
The object eventually disappeared from view, apparently by simply fading out or becoming obscured, I do not know which. There were at least 4 or 5 other witnesses to this sighting, all of whom were fellow students in the area at the time.
I feel that this sighting represents a genuine unidentified flying object, as the object displayed characteristics not consistent with any conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon that I am aware of. The behavior and appearance of the object was very strange and unlike anything I have ever seen before or since. I can find no rational explanation for what I observed that day.

UFOs JUST DEBRI, BL
By DALE HUFFMAN
Daily News Staff Writer
At about 3:15 p.m. EDT on July 3rd, a
group of four persons reported seeing two
objects flying north on I-75 between Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. The objects later maneuvered and appeared to be coming down
"in perfect formation" about 3 miles apart, according to the eye-witness account of three
they observed in the sky.
They were in perfect formation, the
witness's later reported to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and they appeared to
be five minutes, trying to keep an eye on
the flight and going into a cloud.
BUT IN HOUSE no one would
think they were highly imaginative or insane,
the main theme at the objects seemed to be
the military would have to come up as the
mine if they were flying horizontally or
descending.
On the same night, Master Sgt.
Ricky Story, a home in Springfield for the
past
three years, was driving on U.S. Route 68
near Dayton. He observed the sky glow as if
from the flame of a jet engine and several odd,
unidentified lights in the sky.
Back in 1961, a case was called "out for
a better case" at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base.
WHAT THEY SAW, Mike reported
yesterday that the object which appeared to
be an Buick was observed with a small object
trailing it like a satellite orbit.
Reports poured into Lt. Col. Hector
Quintanilla, chief of Blue Book. One housewife said her dog had barked between two
objects as they approached and "seemed
petrified to death"
when they left
an area.
Another man said he had to

Please send me information on what the do in the event of a future sighting. I have often wondered about reports of landings, why people did not shoot at them or attempt to capture or something. I think some effort should be made on the part of sighting to obtain proof and detail information on what takes place since he is the only one around.

Dear Sir:

I am writing this letter in regards to the satellite that was seen on March 3, 1968, around 9 P.M.

On that date, I saw something in the sky that looked like a ball of fire. As I was watching, it broke into three different parts, each part disappearing at different times. I'd say that there was approximately three to four seconds between the disappearance of each (this is a rough estimation). One part could be seen longer than the others, but I can't tell you if it also died out or not. I did not hear anything like a clap of thunder.

If I can be of further help, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

"They said Quintanilla. "I do not personally know anything about these objects. I am asked this frequently. We will send the full reports and records on the whole matter to you directly."
"But as long as there is some physical evidence that something was seen, and a reasonably qualified observer saw it, I believe there are aircraft or objects in space that are perhaps more than just natural phenomena. As to what they might be, I am always interested to have people provide more concrete information."
"YOU NEWSPAPER people have done it all.' Quintanilla said. "In 1957 a Newspaper reported the word 'flying saucer' was already out of style. You were right. It has been almost 20 years that this term has been used." 
"In his official record here, Quintanilla adds that this is only one object coming under his investigation which has not been identified. A citizen in Chesapeake City, Md., reported seeing a bright object in the sky on the night of March 3. He estimated the object he saw was about one quarter the size of the moon, was circular in shape with a bright orange and green lights."
"WE HAVE NOT FOUND much to work on in this case," said Quintanilla. "That is why we are asking it in we can get any more concrete information." He added, "I don't think we ever will end up with a 100 percent solution."

OBSERVERS LOCATION: Driving west on Rt 6, one mile east of Kane, Pa

GENERAL COMMENTS: The observer was driving west on Rt 6 when he first saw the object. When he first saw it, there were three, well above the horizon. My own estimate from talking to him was 30 to 40 feet in size. The objects were traveling northwest. As the observer drove on, the objects moved in number down to one, and he followed it for less than one-fourth mile (1/4), until he found a parking place. He stopped and got out. During this time of him observing the objects, they disappeared (the observer did not see them disappear). The observer only saw the one object at the last, which seemed to be going at about 30 to 40 deg west of north and disappeared in the NE or NNE at about 30 to 40 deg elevation. The object appeared to slow down just prior to its disappearance. The observer could not give an estimate of how bright the object was, but said the full moon is. As you can see by its light, it will cast shadows, and you know how bright the light is. The observer could only say that it was very bright, like a first-quarter moon or perhaps brighter. The observer did state that as the object passed directly in front of him the observer's visibility seemed much greater than when he first saw the object.

NOTES: An AF Form 117 will be sent to Mr. (as per his request) so he will provide more specific directions and elevations.

Enclosure: Map of Kane, Pennsylvania Area

Dear Lt. Tobey:

The letters recently forwarded to GAC regarding aerial phenomena sited by local residents of north central Pennsylvania on 3 March 1968 have been examined.

It is concluded from this new information that at least three pieces traveled beyond impact area A, reported earlier. Two of these three pieces could have landed in area B. The third piece evidently continued beyond area B, probably landing in area C.

If you feel it is warranted a more exact analysis could be performed using the GAC 3-degree-of-freedom re-entry program. However, such an analysis would only be worthwhile if additional information can be made available regarding the orbit of these items.

Dear sir:

This report of the sighting is apparently not acceptable, as the case had been closed sometime ago. The reasons for this at the time of the original report are not clear.

Careful screening of 1968 records shows that there has been no known occurrence of unusual lights or objects northeastward of Boston, Mass. during the date and time period mentioned.

Accordingly, there is no further action which can be taken in this instance. The incident appears to have been a routine observation and not a matter which would warrant more detailed investigation.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Sir,

I was thinking about our conversation last night. I am Fred S. Gray of Stamford, Conn, and I have some information that I think might be of interest to your organization. I was in the newspaper office of this publication a couple days ago concerning a sighting of an unusual light that occurred on Saturday night, February 3, 1968.

I did not see anything myself, but I was in the newspaper office when a couple of people came in to report what they had seen. They described seeing a very bright light in the sky over the Long Island Sound area around 8 p.m. on that date. The light was described as being much brighter than any star or planet, and it maneuvered in a very unusual manner, suddenly speeding up and then hovering, changing directions rapidly. This event lasted for 10-15 minutes.

The newspaper staff was quite interested in the report and planned to investigate further and possibly publish a story. I am passing this information on to you in case it might be of interest or value to your organization. Please treat this information confidentially. 

If you have any questions or would like any additional details, please let me know.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

P.S. It was forwarded to me by N.E.T.O. N.L.O. Adviser.

Dear Sirs:

On March 4th, one of our local newspapers, "The Nashville Tennessean," published an account of sightings of an UFO and put it on front page. The Tennessean gave a report that I shall copy in parts --- March 15, 1960 --- traveling from southwest to northeast in a flat trajectory.

Descriptions of the UFO varied slightly, but, in general, as it flew over Nashville, it was described as fuselage-shaped with lights that appeared from windows. All agreed that it was flying at a high rate of speed and made no noise. Many reported an orange-reddish-brown light at the object. Officially it is to be BLUE BOOK (subject) said they had numerous reports of sightings. They also reported that the UFO had been seen in Little Rock, Ark., Memphis, Tenn., Jackson, Tenn., Lexington, Ky., and Roanoke, Va. A person named that the FBI had reports of sightings all over the southeast.

I have written a report containing a description of my sighting of the UFO and its flight as I observed it over Nashville, Tenn., while standing beside Mayor. I wrote my description from notes I had taken a few days after the event, as I had learned in school that for better accuracy, one should take notes early. I feel it important to relate to you, though alcoholic beverage that I had consumed prior to my UFO sighting. Also, I feel it important to relate to you some references as to my character.

March 2nd, I consumed no alcoholic beverages -- or drugs of any kind.
March 3rd: I consumed no alcoholic beverages (or drugs) until we arrived.

Text from the document:

NASHVILLE MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM
CONVENTIONS • SPORTS EVENTS • TRADE SHOWS • EXPOSITIONS • SPECTACULARS • CONCERTS
METROPOLITAN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE
VOLUME I NO. 3 JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1958
THE PARTHENON
In Centennial Park 
Nashville, Tennessee

One of the extremely valuable contributions made by Nashville to the cultural life of our nation is the magnificent architectural offering of the Parthenon, known as the "Athens of the South." This building was first erected in 1897 for the gallery of fine arts for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. After the Exposition closed, the Parthenon was abandoned and fell into a state of decay. But in 1927, the people of Nashville raised funds and restored the beloved building to stand for nearly 30 years. The Board of Parks Commissioners got together and decided that this Parthenon should be a permanent part of Nashville. But Nashville is ever-growing and this parcel of ground upon which the Parthenon stood is now considered to be too small for the present reproduction. 
The present Parthenon, at Athens, was begun in 438 B.C. and was the shrine of Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom. The Parthenon is a great example of Doric architecture with the surrounding sculpture and statuary depicting Greek history, philosophy, and mythology, as well as the statue of the Goddess of Wisdom, in order that the replica here in Nashville may reflect the true Parthenon.
Nashville's Parthenon differs from the original in Athens in several features. There is a difficult light overhead as opposed to the more even light of the sun on the original. This is essential due to our colder winters during which time the great bronze doors must be closed. We have passageways from the interior to the exterior to provide additional light. The Greek laymen were not permitted to view the interiors of this sacred temple, but we have made available much of the interior structure. The reproduction here in Nashville was of marble re-enforced with steel, the last process being unknown in Greece.
The Parthenon, as it stands today, is concrete re-enforced with steel which, in several respects, is more durable than the original, the Baptistery excepted. They possess it, but these are not the originals, the Baptistery was cast from molds of the first. The Greeks used their Parthenon for 900 years as a temple; the Christians used it for 900 years as a church; and the Turks used it for 200 years as a Mosque.
There is a basement for the Parthenon for the enjoyment of visitors. It houses several permanent fine arts exhibits. It is not to be the reproduction and should not be so interpreted as such.
The city of Nashville accepted the restoration of the Parthenon in 1927 and it functions today under the authority of the Board of Parks and Recreation. Around 500,000 visit this great structure each year. The visitors come from far and wide to visit and study its pure classic beauty. They are students of art, history and architecture, as well as people on vacation and school groups.

THE JIM RICE STORY
Mr. Jim Rice, Auditorium Manager, since October 1962. And I might add a very capable and graphic manager. Mr. Rice was a native of Nashville, Tennessee. As a young man, he became associated with the Nashville Theatre as assistant manager. In 1932 the Auditorium had its grand opening, and Jim Rice became the manager. He has held this position to the present time. Through the years, his management and his contact with all types of entertainment have made him extremely important to the fulfillment of our Auditorium program. With his keen insight to Nashville's financial needs, he has proven a major asset to Nashville financial institutions.
In the facilities in this $8-million structure, with a seating capacity of 10,000, we have been able to attract many major conventions that we would not have been able to secure without this Municipal Auditorium. It houses major shows, sports events, concerts, expositions, spectaculars. It is adjoining 500-car parking area, giving us truly an accommodation for Nashvillians and the visiting public.
We wish to congratulate our Municipal Auditorium Commissioner, Mr. James H. Armistead, Vice President and Advertising Director of The Nashville Banner, for winning national first place for promotion of a recent advertising series for the American Petroleum Institute. The first place plaque was presented to Mr. Armistead in New Orleans in January at the convention of the International Newspaper Advertising Executives Association.
Mr. Armistead, it is very gratifying to us at the Nashville Banner as Nashville's leading newspaper, to be accorded this national honor. We are indeed proud.

THE NASHVILLE SOUND . . .

The acts include: The Pompoff-Thedy Comedy act, making their first appearance; The Aacal Sisters, Willy Necker's amazing leaping Dalmatians, the finest dog act on stage today; Colonel Senbright and his amazing way pole act; Dave Overton, popular WSM radio personality, will make his first appearance as master of ceremonies; and finally Jack Gregory and his show band will put music to Music City's top stage show.

General admission still the lowest known in America - only 50 cents for adults and 25 cents for children. The proceeds go to Sunrise charities. Advance tickets may be bought from members of the Nashville Sentinel Club and at a number of business establishments throughout Metropolitan Nashville. This great show is brought to you as a community service by The Nashville Sentinel Club and The Nashville Tennessee.

in My or Beverly Briloy Home, which was about 4:45 PM Central Standard time.
At this time, I was served about 1 1/2 oz. bourbon whiskey, ice and water. I sipped this drink from an "old fashioned type glass" until about 5:30 when my glass was replenished with the second serving of bourbon whiskey. This second drink did not look as strong as the first. At the dinner table, about 6:00 PM, I started sipping one wine glass full of rather dry wine. We began our dinner.

During dinner, I sipped down the second helping of the same wine. I enjoyed a HUGE DINNER. We remained seated around the dinner table engaged in conversation. Around 7:00 o'clock, I was served an After Dinner drink -- (Irish or Scotch Mist, I think they called it). Since then, I have not bothered to ask questions concerning amounts or brands of liquor served to me. A little while later, from the same tiny glass, I drank another After dinner drink of another brand. It was sweet tasting, not potent, and definitely was not "absinthe".

I FELT MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY ALERT BY 8:45 PM !!!

As to my mentality, I would say that I was at least, a good average, being that I graduated in the top 1/4 level of my high school class. I attended 2 years of college before marrying_____

I am 47 years old and my vision is nearly 20-20 at a distance. (I need glasses for close viewing only.) Nashville, Tenn.

I have been taking Art lessons since Summer 1957. (Art lessons to each persons to be keener observers.)

In the 1940s, I became Girl Scout leader and served in that capacity for 8 or 9 yrs. I was also Girl Scout Neighborhood Chm. for Hillwood School, Nashville, for a number of years. I was a Nashville District Chm., Girl Scouts (volunteer work) and also served on the Nashville Girl Scout Council.

Around 1959, I became Den Mother to a Cub Scout Den and served in that capacity for 3 years.

My husband and I have recently completed our investigation and recreation. Also, he was elected as a member of the National Recreation and Parks Assoc. "George" has advised me to send my report to the U. S. Air Force officials.

You may make copies of my report and letter in the event that you want to send them to other Gov't offices. However, I do not want the enclosed material to be released for public reading. I hope that my report will serve some use.

Thank you.

Yours truly,
Mrs. [redacted]

P.S. I am enclosing one of our Metropolitan papers in which I have marked with red, some facts and two statements that are included in my report.

Sunday, March 3, 1968, - - - -,Nashville and Davidson County). It was me, my wife and the Baileys. George and I had enjoyed dinner at the Baileys' home in Nashville. About 8:45 PM Central Standard Time and I left the house and walked to the parking lot where the three of us stood talking. I saw a light traveling in the sky a little above the southwest horizon. This light seemed only a bit larger and brighter than a star, and it seemed to be the same color as a star. As I yelled to the others to look, the light became brighter and larger. While I was observing this "traveling light" from a great distance away, it did not look to me that it was traveling in a flat trajectory. Rather, it seemed to travel in a slight arc, and at this point of flight, I began to note the "orangish-colored" trail of light behind the "star-colored" light. You know what I mean. This "orangish" tail or trail was an annoying distraction to me while I was trying to listen for some sound, so I bossed loudly, "Hush with your mouth!" The three of us stood silent, almost motionless, and very much in awe as we realized that the "thing" was headed our way and was coming surprisingly near us! There were some leafless trees in the distance that partially silhouetted our vision, but the "thing" remaining a moment. Then - - VANISH!!! For me, the "thing" is recalling to be the impact on my emotions, for with breath-taking suddenness, the "thing" was merely overhead and seemed to be quite large and close. To be more explicit, the "thing" looked like it was headed directly over the far corner of the house. It was shaped like a fat cigar, in my estimation. I was impressed that it seemed of considerable size - the size of one of our largest airliners, or larger (there goes my minute estimations!). It appeared to have rather square shaped windows along the side that was facing us. I remember the urge to count windows, but other details flashed by too rapidly for me to be positive of the accuracy of my observation.

in view and my curiosity made me "jump to other observations." For an instant, I thought I caught a glimpse of a "metallic look" about the fuselage, and this really made me feel that the "thing" was close! (Later, after the thing was more visible, it seemed as though a faint light reflected on the fuselage.(Perhaps the faint light came from the lights of the city or from the lights of the "thing.")) It appeared to me that the fuselage was constructed of many pieces of flat sheets of metal-like material with a "riveted together look." It appeared to me that the fuselage was not of smooth contour. The gray "windows" seemed to be lit up inside the fuselage. This light seemed to be about the same color as light coming from the windows of our homes. I did not observe anything other than the light in the windows. (It occurred to me that I might see objects or persons, but there was too little time for a good look.) My rough estimate is that 2/3 or 3/4 of the fuselage near the front end, had windows that were lit up. About 1/3 or 1/4 of the fuselage toward the rear end was dark or without lights. I did not observe any blinking lights on the "thing" like we have on our planes. From out of the back end of the fuselage came a wide (roughly about the width of the fuselage) --- long, "grayish-orangish-yellowish" stream of dusty fire. It seemed as though particles of dust were on fire. These tiny sparkles seemed to make up the light from it, and the light appeared to be of quite low light intensity when compared to the lighting from the "windows."

I listened intently for some sound from the "thing" but I didn't hear even a whisper of sound!!! This was the most eerie part of my whole experience!! Certainly, there should be some sound from an aircraft that looked to be so near!! 
It flashed in my mind that perhaps the sound was yet to follow.

Then--- HULLABALOO!! --- We all started talking at the same time! In the course of our expressionism, the conversation went something like this:

Someone: "It didn't make any sound!" (That wasn't a meteor, because a meteor doesn't have windows, but I'll be damned if I'll report it!) "I'm not going to report it either!" (Laughter) Someone: "Tremendous speed!" "What time is it?" (Looking at his watch) "Quarter to nine." "How high would you guess it was?" "Not more than 2,000 to 5,000 feet, or maybe lower. That thing was really low!" "What direction?" "Southwest to northeast." Whatever it was, it will be in the papers tomorrow." ------- As we excitedly compared notes, we agreed that we had seen some sort of our observations. This "agreement" seemed to comfort me, for I certainly didn't want to think that I had just experienced my first hallucination while I was wide awake - All three of us agreed that we had seen something other than any plane we had seen or had read about from our Earth. We thought that we had seen a "craft of some sort, except 2,000 or 3,000 feet from our Earth," or that we had seen a "craft from Outer Space." It was chilly outside and Mayor wasn't wearing a coat. Besides, our short discussion of the event seemed to suffice. It didn't seem strange that, so soon after, all three of us went back to our routine of daily living, for, after all, can anything really surprise us these days in this scientific era!

Most sincerely written,

I was impressed with what looked to me like low altitude of the craft at this point of my sighting -- I thought, around 1,000 feet or less. Also, when the craft was flying near us, it did seem to travel in a flat trajectory.

I toyed with the idea that it even slowed down somewhat -- for how else could we observe so much detail in a mere flash across the sky? (It didn't think it slowed down.)

The craft was headed away from us now. I concentrated on the "trail" of fiery particles that seemed to come from out of the end of the fuselage. I was expecting to see a bright ball of fire close to the fuselage end, but I saw no bright ball of fire. However, I noticed that the trail's light intensity did increase somewhat (the observer noticed this increase in trail brightness too) but, this was undoubtedly since we were looking at a longer stretch of trail as it passed by.

In other words, length of trail view instead of the previous width of trail view. Because the flight pattern of the craft was at a slight angle from where we were standing, it was possible, for a brief moment, to see near the "fiery trail's end" and one or a few lit up "windows", simultaneously. Upon this observation, I concluded that there must be an outline bulges in the fuselage, especially after I had lost account that there were no windows in the near end. Also, this simultaneous view of nearly full "trail light" and "one or a few lit-window lights" gave me the opportunity to compare light intensities again. The light from the window or windows seemed brighter than the trail light.

All too soon, the "thing" was flying away, low and over the treetops towards the northeast. I could see only the "rectangular light of the trail" now. Certainly, SOUND would come from this craft!!! The three of us remained quiet while looking and listening. I was still expecting to hear noise, but, instead, there remained that unbelievable silence!!! The three of us remained quiet for awhile, even after the craft was well out of sight. We all were baffled by that SILENCE!!!

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of a UFO. The sketch shows a cigar-shaped object with several windows or portholes along the sides. The text describes the author's attempt to sketch the UFO as they saw it, noting details about the windows, the overall shape, and the author's observations regarding the symmetry and size of the object.

Text transcription:

Page 5.

However inaccurate I may be, I have taken it upon myself to try to sketch the UFO as I saw it. The part of my sketch that I am the most unsure about is the windows. My "mind's eye" was far too slow to count windows, but I feel safe to estimate that I saw 10 or more. I would not state that these "windows" were exactly square or exactly rectangular, but I think that I saw "squared corners." A possible bulge in the craft's fuselage, the fast speed of the craft and my trying to observe fuselage, shape and color, color of light and make up of trail, leaves me in quite a bit of wonderment about the windows.

Also, I was more interested in looking into these windows than I was in studying window shapes. However, I feel strongly that the windows had definite symmetrical shapes, were clearly outlined as the craft passed by and were lined up in a row horizontally. I feel safe to stress that the windows did not look blurred or fuzzy, but had clear, definite shapes. I observed, also, that the windows looked quite large -- I would say larger than the windows we have in our planes.

Fuselage area was dark here so I didn't notice that "metalic look" here like I did around window area.

Dear Sir:

I am sending you my observations of a UFO that was sighted in many parts of the USA on Sunday Night March 3, 1968.

I hope this information will be helpful in identifying the object or objects.

My observations are as follows:
1) Time of observation - 9:46 pm March 3, 1968
2) Place of observation - Oliver Springs, Tenn. 
3) Direction of observation - Approx. N 45 seconds
4) Approximate duration of observation - Approx. 1:30
5) Nature of UFO - The UFO was first seen as it passed tangent to the lower edge of the near full moon, then appeared to be inclined at a nearly ecliptic angle as illustrated.

As the UFO moved east, it passed in front of the constellation CASSIOPEIA, and disappeared in the NE in the vicinity of Constellation DRACO.

9) Apparent size - 1/4 to the length of the diameter of moon, at the time it was observed passing the view of the observer. The size of the object appeared to be from 1/4 to 1/2 the width of the adult hand held at arm's length viewing.

The width of the UFO could have been obscured from view partly, as the edge could not be clearly distinguished from a point due north the craft appeared to come on the scene. It appeared to slow down to a point where it was going to hover or stop, and the object also appeared to slow down and to come closer to the observer, and then it went away rapidly. The brightness of the light from the object became much brighter, and the UFO disappeared behind a hill. When the UFO reappeared, the intensity of the fire one was about 1/4 that of the initial intensity.

10) General comments - I have viewed the skies for twenty years for so-called UFO and this is the first thing I have never been able to identify or explain to my satisfaction. Taping my observations I did not note if any of the stars were observed from view as being part of the space scene. From my observations I could not deduct at the space could have been occupied or illuminated. The UFO did not behave as any known meteor or satellite. I would appreciate being informed of the outcome of the investigation of this UFO.

Yours truly,
[Redacted]

Text extracted from the image:

Last night, March 34, 1963, I stayed over night with my cousin, as we had planned in advance. He had wanted me to visit him and his family for some time. Upon arrival we settled in and made myself at home. Then about 8:30 p.m. the children and I went outside for some kind of recreation-colored object fly across the valley. About two or three minutes later my wife came running up the house yelling and pointing telling me about the same thing. I immediately went outside and watched very, very carefully for about one half an hour. The object came up over the tree tops or mountain range and it was absolutely still, stationary, for several minutes and then shot off towards the west again very, very clearly, and was just a blur in a few seconds. All colors of the rainbow, red, green, blue, yellow were visible on this object. It remained stationary from horizon to horizon, very bright and seemed about the size of the business end of a lead pencil held at arm's length. It would have been seen very, very clearly by all those enjoying the good weather outside their homes in the area. I was reminded of the UFO near the windows I would have seen them them. As I indicated, my cousin, the children and myself all saw the object and it had remained stationary and then shot off towards the west as I mentioned before. We called the air base and reported the sighting and it had been reported on the outskirts of Medford. We compared notes with five other observers and the intelligence observer from the police station, who interviewed us the next morning. They asked us many questions. I'm quite sure that the other five observers and myself know the UFO was there. But the other five observers and myself know the UFO was there.

Dear Sir,
This will reply to your letter of March 1, 1968, in which you described an unidentified flying object (UFO) that you observed. 
Thank you for reporting this observation. However, as you will realize, the observed object does not fall into the technical or physical realm; your technical analysis, therefore, will be able to investigate the matter further.
Thank you for your interest. Please report it as a "good" UFO which I can further investigate.
Sincerely,

Transcription of the text in the document:

"U. F. O. Headquarters
4. G. Air force
Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen:

On the night of february 23, at 1920 hrs., a disc-like object was sighted and observed for 5 minutes. The object was oval or elliptical in shape, approximately 30' in diameter and observed at an altitude of approximately 1000 ft. It was silent and moved across the sky at a high speed, between 350-400 mph. The object was observed by two independent witnesses simultaneously.

At about 1940 hrs., the same object reappeared and was observed for an additional 5 minutes. The object was again observed at an altitude of approximately 1000 ft. and moved at a high speed, estimated to be between 350-400 mph.

I feel compelled to report this incident as I feel it has significant bearing on the community of intelligence relative to the subject. If you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,"

"length of time they could be kept in the air. Strange maneuvers seemed to be made by the little lights overhead. a maneuverable disk or craft as some of the objects were called. none of these was commented upon any control authority, line of sight indicated position and movement. as far as we could determine, there was no characteristic shape or configuration that could be relied upon to identify such objects in the future. the sightings of course covered only a brief portion of the actual time the objects were in the air. some appeared in the early evening and remained visible until dawn the next day. a portion of the objects seen appeared to move about independently, not in formation. no photograph or other physical evidence was obtained, although efforts were made to obtain such evidence. the sightings were so brief, unexpected, and generally at night that obtaining photographic evidence was extremely difficult. we must caution that due to the uncertain nature of the sightings and the almost complete lack of reliable physical evidence, it is difficult to make any definite identification or evaluation. the reports indicate that the objects were quite real and were seen by competent observers, but further research seems essential before any firm conclusions can be drawn."

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
Subj: UFO Observation, 3 March 1969
Writer: Dayton, Ohio 45449
called to report an unidentified flying object that he observed at 9:45 pm on 3 March 1969. He worked for the General Motors Corporation as a Supervisor and has been trained for proper observations for and data.  He has never seen an UFO before. He saw three flying in a formation that he couldn't identify. The objects were going very fast, there was no sound, it left a trail. The brightness was not consistent, it seemed that the two on the side were more consistent, appeared like a flame and was sparkling. He dives in slightly hills and saw the object go from the horizon in the SW to the horizon in the NE. Way up high. It was going a terrific speed. He compared it to a meteorite, however the observation was much too long for that of a meteorite, saw it for one to two minutes. He said that he often watches for the meteor showers. He would like to complete an AF Form 117 on his observation.

Dear Sir:

On March 3, at approximately 9:45 pm - we were 25 miles west of Elizabethtown - coming in on the Western Ky Parkway. When we sighted a figure-shaped object directly ahead - slightly to the left of the North Star.

The object appeared to be vertically ascending. When first sighted it was brighter and as it climbed more ghost-like in appearance until it was no longer visible.

Hope this will be of some help to you.

Sincerely yours,

On March 3, 1963, between 9:45 and 9:50 p.m., EST, numerous observers in the Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania area sighted several whitish to bluish white lights that appeared to have orangish-red tails. The majority of the observers stated that there were three objects traveling in a northeast direction. 

These objects were sighted by numerous ground observers and also by several aircraft pilots. Indianapolis FAA Center was notified at the time of the sightings, but did not pick up any objects on radar that could be correlated to the UFOs. The Space Detection Center reported that they were certain that the sightings were the result of the decay of space debris into the earth's atmosphere. The sighting is being carried as a satellite decay in Project Blue Book files.

MARTIN MARIETTA CORPORATION
Baltimore, Maryland
March 4, 1968

Captain [REDACTED]
United Air Lines
Station Field
Denver, Colorado

Dear Captain [REDACTED],

Captain John Morrison, whom I have met here at the Martin Marietta Corporation, has asked me to write you regarding a UFO sighting by me on the night of February 3, 1968.

I was flying a Lockheed Jetstar at 33,000 feet and indicating Mach 0.82. The weather was clear and winds indicated visibility. A beam UHF light was observed at a flight of fifteen or twenty thousand feet higher. At first, the light appeared to resemble a flight of two aircraft in trail. The light moved at a high rate of speed, at a steady course and altitude. My heading was 87° so I would guess its heading was south.

As it passed at 12 o'clock, they definitely appeared as two distinct light sources. Each light source consisted that I would describe as a pencil beam of light. This beam had no taper, did not trail off but maintained a constant cross-section and simply disappeared in seemingly a instant. I would describe it as white in color changing to phosphorescent. The changes in color were subtle and did not appear modulated.

When these lights moved to 1300 o'clock the front light seemed to be outdistancing the rear light. The rear lights at this angle appeared as two distinct lights of similar intensity and both boiled and roiled in identical pencil beams of light. A few seconds later, it all disappeared from sight because of the distance.

The time was approximately 10:45 p.m. EST. My course was a doppler track from 270 degrees to 105. Drift was six degrees right. The total time this was observed was between 40 and 50 seconds. All this observation is as it was actually witnessed and my contact confirms with everything as it is stated here.

However, since the road curved he could not say positively. He was pretty sure that it passed to the north.

The observer was flying over London, Kentucky, VOR at 10,500 ft (about 13:1 miles south of Cincinatti VOR) wherein first sighted the objects to the west at what appeared to be 18,000 to 20,000 ft. The time was 0500 pm and the object was in sight for about 8 minutes duration. When the objects passed in front of the observer they seemed to be about 60 deg single with the horizon. Others seemed to be along side, and one was trailing the others. The observer compared the sightings to lights shining on contrails. When first seen there were numerous lights but some of the lights went out after they had passed. It seemed like the observer was passing well below the objects.

The course of the objects was at about a 75 deg heading. The objects just seemed to fade out of sight before going over the horizon.

TDPT (UFO)
March 3rd re-entry

Mr. [redacted]
University of Colorado
Boulder, Colorado 80302

Dear Bob:

Reference your memo of 9 July 1969. It has been my experience that a small, rumble, or a swift is associated with the re-entry of a object.

The characteristics of the sound depend upon the shape and size of the object. Smaller fragments tend to make a swish, larger fragments a rumble; depending upon the shape and density of the object. A swiftly moving object in a straight line will produce a sharp, cracking sound, the smaller fragments, within a much, much smaller radius. 

On the 3 March 1969 incident, we could find no evidence of anyone hearing a sound. The night was cold and clear and the people had their windows closed and there was a light wind. This could be an indication that the re-entry fragments fell in a densely wooded area. The best possibility that the re-entry fragments fell in a densely wooded area, East of the recovery. We have no sound; however, we might be looking in the wrong place for the recovery of the fragments.

Thank you for the article, I will be looking forward to seeing you in the near future.

Sincerely,

GEORGE QUINTANILLA, Jr. Lt Colonel, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Office

"Hector:
I'm sure you've seen the attached by ____ in case you haven't _____________. I'm interested to know whether anybody who reported this thing suggested he heard a sonic boom? Would you expect that there ought to be a report of one? Of course, there is no lift associated with a re-entering object, and, from reading, this literature on sonic booms, I conclude that lift is more responsible for sonic boom than volume. Even so, there would be a boom in connection with the Zond 4 re-entry. Maybe, for such an object, the noise of the re-entry is very minor, and you would not expect a report. What has been your experience in such matters?
Sincerely yours,
B. G."

I compare this with meteorites, missile re-entries and satellites I have seen and am certain this is none of these. I hope this information is helpful. I have no other information to add and heard perhaps half a dozen air carrier pilots make similar reports.

Drop me a line when you compare this and next time I am in Denver, I would enjoy a chat with you.

Text from the document:

Flaming Objects Seen, Many Traced to a Soviet Space Shot
By WALTER SULLIVAN

At about 9:45 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on March 6, a woman in Ravenna, Ohio, looked through her kitchen window and saw a procession of fiery objects fly past. In about two minutes there were half a dozen or more, she told the United States Air Force.
"Two or three minutes later," she reported to her United States Air Force base, "my cousin, my aunt and my husband came running into the house telling me to come out and see the U.F.O.'s (unidentified flying objects) they had just seen."
It was at an altitude of about 30,000 feet, she said, and was seen very clearly across the sky, going very fast and in a straight line. All of the observers agreed that it was no aircraft they had ever seen before. They could distinguish no wings, it was on fire both in front and behind, and it seemed to leave a trail of sparks, she said.
A woman in Ohio told how she saw the U.F.O.'s pass over, had lain between trash cans in her driveway and had been "frightened to death." 
In Tennessee, a woman said she had "an overpowering drive to stand" and watched a U.F.O. in 1956. In Tennessee, a woman was reported as sighting a U.F.O. in 1956.

FLYING SAUCER I TRACED TO SPACE SHOT BY SOVIET

At the time, they lights would have been considered highly slight since the predicted objects to plunge were considered were a good sight, as some 10.000 feet or were only a few thousand feet above them. A 93-cent Bargain
A study of this file also illustrates the excitement that seems to come observe both when confronted with unidentified flying objects. It also shows that others, such as airline pilots, can have similar encounters with such objects, some of which they report as definitely "unidentified," particularly when their reports seem sufficiently amazing to warrant such characterization.
Included in the file are reports from a Eastern Airlines pilot over Pennsylvania, a United Air Lines pilot over Iowa, and an American Airlines plane over Tennessee, among others. Each pilot reported spotting formations of bright objects which gave the impression of being intelligently controlled, even though in most cases the objects were spotted so briefly and at such long distance they could not be identified positively as anything more than unidentified.
Such reports continue to come in from various sources, and while the majority are undoubtedly due to astronomical phenomena or various man-made objects, a significant percentage still defy explanation, even after the fullest possible investigation. This is certainly one of the reasons the U.F.O. remains a problem that the Air Force and other interested agencies must continue to study.
In the "summary" section of the file, the observation is made that "many of the pilots' reports indicate the existence of a previously unidentified aerial phenomenon that appears to be of considerable scientific interest and importance." The report continues, saying that while the majority of sightings undoubtedly have natural explanations, "a significant percentage" defy explanation, and that is why the U.F.O. remains a problem to be studied.

Text from the document:

Dear Sir:

I am presently enrolled as a student at Bethany College, Bethany, West Virginia. On approximately 9:30 p.m. Saturday night, as I was returning to my dormitory after leaving the Bethany College campus, I noticed two bright, light-colored objects in the sky traveling at a high rate of speed.

The objects appeared to be one of the others. One appeared to be of greater speed traveling at a greater or lesser speed than the pursuing object. The pursuing object seemed to have emitted two object in rapid succession, and seemed to be closely watching the first object were slower, the fires and the pursuit appear more intense.

The objects were clearly visible, the first object more distant. The pursuance more close and the phenomenon strange. I was standing and observed it for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The objects appeared and disappeared. The wind was calm, sky clear, and the temperature was rather cold.

I would appreciate any information regarding this phenomenon as I am most curious as to the exact nature of the sighting. If possible, please return this letter to me at the above address.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Fourth sketch by Mr. ______ of an object description given to him by a pilot of a spacecraft in flight at time of sighting. Time was shortly after 2:55 a.m.

Pilot stated that it looked like four rocket pods would lock in if moving in toward the center surface. Cruise bell-shaped and suggested motor out or rocket. Bottles nearly suggest size of such an imaginary rocket.

Photograph was Westbound and 10 miles west of Northeastern. Pilot estimated their altitude as being in the neighborhood of 20,000 feet. They were moving at a very high speed.

Pilot was impressed by the white or silvery color of the craft to the four objects, stating that each was about one-half a mile in length.

Weekly Staff Report Item 		12 March 1968
Subj: Satellite Decay
On March 3, 1968, between 9:45 and 9:50 p.m., EST, numerous observers in the Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania areas sighted several whitish to bluish-white lights that appeared to have orbited together. The major concern was that the lights might be either fragments from a satellite decay or unconventional aircraft. The reports appear to have passed between Pittsburgh and New Castle, Pennsylvania on an approximate northeast heading. The Air Force Office is currently contacting airports, air bases, and police departments in Pennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts in the areas of reporting for any additional information.

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968
TIME: 9:45 PM 
DURATION: 1 Minute
DESCRIPTION: Thought it looked like something burning up in space. Three main objects in formation, however, I think there was something within the objects. I could only see the fire trails, yellow orange-red lights where they came across the horizon. The object disappeared over the horizon. The object seemed to be coming in from the atmosphere but it didn't lose any altitude - they were in formation, one out in front of the other. This is the only case of the other. though it looked like a burn in. I was about 20 miles from Cleveland.
FIRST SAW: 30 - 45 degrees elevation, traveled in an easterly direction.

Mr. saw a UFO and said he didn't know how to describe it. 
It seemed to be "V" shaped, like three jets in formation. I didn't think it was jets because the last two were too close together, left a stream of smoke across the sky. He was sitting in a drive in theater on Rt 30 at the time of the observation. Object was going west to east. 
I didn't think much of the observation until I heard about it this morning. Saw it for about fifteen seconds, quite high, couldn't estimate altitude, and couldn't describe the object. When it started overhead I saw it.

DETAILS: I saw an object at 9:51 pm for 75-85 second, it seemed much longer but it probably wasn't. She made sketches of the object. Saw it through field glasses and when it was looking up it first appeared like a meteor or comet. I always take my field glasses along when I let the dog out. Saw one object and it was coming straight down at 80 deg are, was rapid speed but then as it got closer to the horizon it slowed down, then it suddenly became three. It was not a falling star because of the colors. Orange-white-red-orange. Similar to the color of the sun. They flew in a perfect military formation. The object was flat and the bottom part had a protrusion, moved very slowly in a NNE direction. I have four college degrees and I'm not sure, I teach science. I was afraid of getting the camera for fear I would lose the object and I want the objects to come and see us. There were no sparks, just a solid red-orange trail. Coming straight down and disappeared behind a house. Flashed a flashlight at the object in morse code, SOS and then again four times to the object. Also her dog is afraid of the cold and so he crawled behind the speaker can and layed down and whined. wanted to fill out a form and send her sightings to us.

ZOND & DEBRIS REENTRY OF 1968 MARCH 3

On this date at approximately 5:45 p.m. M.S.T., a rather brilliant object appeared, being reported to one of our active A.M.S. members, Glen Wells, at University of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky. He at once had a fireball questionnaire published in a local paper. Due to this, reports came from many people. The writer at first assumed that it was a fireball with time of visibility greatly exaggerated, but as all reports showed a great duration it became evident that it was something unusual. Soon thereafter Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio sent a large number of reports which had come to them. And ---- at Denver, Office of United States, received a number of reports from many people. Later Professor V.H. Chappell, Abrams Planetarium, East Lansing, Michigan, sent several reports and a key one came from Sky and Telescope. Eventually over 60 were available from all sources. Only with this prompt and efficient assistance, which is most gratefully acknowledged, could this solution be made.

It was obvious that this case could be handled by the same methods we use for fireballs. Hence the usual chart was prepared with all stations plotted thereon and the azimuth lines to sub-beginning and sub-end points drawn. Each such solution represents its peculiar difficulties and, in this, it is that too many stations lie quite near the vertical plane of body's motion. For some it actually crossed this vertical plane.

zenith. Hence an excellent direction of motion and azimuth of the radiant is obtained, but determining the heights are more troublesome as few usable reports came from well to the side. Fortunately, the report from SHB, Oliver Springs, Tennessee, by _ of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is most complete. His diagram shows that the object grazed Moon's lower limb. As we already had the path's azimuth this gives an excellent height near the beginning point. We were even more fortunate in that Professor J.F. Phillips, Florence State College, Florence Alabama, was using a 6-inch telescope pointed to U Venus, and had the body cross its field. While we take in the beginning point. The two corresponding heights are 74.0 km and 74.2 km respectively. We assume therefore, that H1 is 74.1 km. For the end point at STP, Hubbard, Ohio, gave an excellent drawing of the path on a star map showing that it ended at E Bootis. This gives H2 as 37.6 km. The average of 5 other altitudes which seem reasonably good also gives H2 as 37.6 km. So we assume H2 was 37.5 ± 13.1 km. There were numerous other estimates of altitudes but many observers were so near the vertical plane of the path that the altitudes error in estpnate would affect the heights greatly. Some even referred the path to certain stars, we take the projected path length as 1122 km. Due to the excessively small inclination the true length can be assumed as the same. It is quite possible that the body was some.

became visible before seen at S69, and the end point is even more right to the original two bodies disintegrating into many, so persons at different distances would see a different end. However, the 1122 length and the given 11 and 12' fully define the coordinates of the atmospheric path.

Observers in general reported a practically horizontal path. Some further south reported two objects and that, as the object continued on it broke into more separate pieces, until near the end it became practically a "shoal" or fragments, moving in parallel paths, many times as long as broad. No long enduring trail was reported. As to brightness, it certainly was much less than full Moon, but several reported it as brighter than Venus. It showed a definite disk. There was more than usual agreement that the color was white-red. 

As to the velocity in our atmosphere, we have 23 estimates running from 6 sec. to 6 min. The estimates are complicated in that some say only part of the path, also that nobody had a stop-watch, and for durations of over 10 seconds estimated durations are subject to great errors.

About this time, I was informed that the Space Defense Center was predicting the decay of debris from found b into the atmosphere for the time and along the same ground trace as observed for the problem in question. Since the velocity would have been on the order of 5-7

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

Since writing you in regard to a probable error in the orbit I sent you, I have given considerable thought to the matter. In fact, the corrections for curvature and zenith distance are so enormous, thatthe tables for the letter are far from accurate when the object's present is practically on the horizon, and the longitude corrections are so great, that this case. Also what you are interested in is the path in the atmosphere. The heliocentric orbit I tried to calculate had no reality, and was indeed a waste of time. Also with corrections to radiant's position so great, in any case it would be most uncertain.

In view of these facts, I am asking that you destroy page 3 of my original paper, and substitute enclosed page 3. This will in no way make the paper less use for your purposes, and I.on mature consideration, will feel much more comfortable when the uncertain and wholly hypothetical case is suppressed.

I regret troubling you with these changes, but the present form will be much more suitable, and less likely for criticism.

Most sincerely yours,

Dear Colonel Quintanilla:

Following my last letter of a few 
days ago, I have recomputed the orbit of the March 3,1968, object, putting in the curve-ture correction with the proper sign. Fortunately it does not change the text in any respect nor the sidereal path, only the last 6 digits need change with data on the orbit. I will now put the figures in as they should be:

Radiant corrected           a 52" h -7"
                           R.A. 58" Decl. - 32"

Parabolic orbit:  Inclination      18"
Long-Ascending node       164"  
Long. Perihelion          327" 
Perihelion distance       0.93 A.U.

I regret the necessity of having 
to ask that you make the corrections, but fortunately they are at the very end.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

This morning I was working on the corrections for a fireball and was about to put the corrections for Kitt anning in. To my dismay I suddenly remembered that I had put it in with a 3 min. 30 sec. error in the orbit I sent you so please hold publication until I correct this.

Fortunately this error I made does not effect the atmospheric path at all, nor the computed distance to the radiographic path, the error changed only the altitude of the terminal point and the parabolic orbit.

As I believe you plan to publish until after 1969 begins, I suggest you do not be serious - it is a hope that you will accept the corrections I sent you only for ten days and let it off to you. As said before, no other significant changes in the paper. Only from the radiant coordinates on, will changes be needed.

I naturally regret this, but for some years now do all my work alone, and have no one to check with me. This inevitably leads to some errors, which are not so rare. I found by me.

Sincerely yours,

The two editors I put this idea across. But the next one I invited on India interrupted me, and this is not clear and I drifted.

However, I wish that I follow American custom in the matter, and as they had changed my capitals to small letters, I shall continue to do so. Please do not send me any more country data, as I do not think it is worth while to do more of them.

Kindly sent me this date, as you kindly wrote. I received it July 2; fireballist, and while it is dated Continental, I hope to be completed in the near future. Your cooperation in sending fireballist data has now in many cases permitted the solution of their paths and orbits. I write to tell the continuance to me benefits.

Ballistic Reentry of 1966 March 3

On this date at approximately 5:48 p.m. E.S.T., a brilliant object appeared to descend rapidly, emitting a bright-blue trail, to the horizon northwest of Northeastern University, Boston, Mass. The object was observed by a large number of people, including members of the faculty and student body. The observer is first a retired man, a college professor who has had several previous sightings. Due to this report, a number of other people came forward to furnish their observations. The observer is familiar with the phenomenon of satellite and meteor visibility, but he is convinced that this object was neither a satellite nor a meteor. The object appeared to descend vertically to the horizon, and its brightness and speed of descent were such as to make it clearly distinguishable from any known phenomenon. Only after some prolonged observation did the object appear to change its rate of descent, exhibiting some oscillating motion. This oscillating motion seemed to indicate a stabilization or check of its course of descent, suggesting some type of controlled maneuvering. By the time the object reached the horizon, its brightness had diminished considerably, and it appeared to blend into the haze. The reports from witnesses describe this object as appearing to "land" on or near the horizon, but it is not clear whether this was an actual landing or simply a disappearance from view.

The Air Force explanatory report on this incident, which was submitted to the Northeastern University, Boston, Mass., stated that the object was probably a meteor or satellite. However, the observers insist that the object was not a meteor or satellite, and they contend that it exhibited characteristics not typical of either of these phenomena. The observers believe that the object was some type of aircraft or vehicle under intelligent control, although they do not claim to know its origin or purpose.

The time is servis tivaly, we presume thereso-e about HL Jr Ph.D for the end 2211 at 372, Hubbard, Ohio,------ it extends for the of the path on star mag 8. This is at most at Bootes. This gives H2 as 37.6 km. The average of 5 other officials wrich seem reasonably good taso have H2 as 37.6 km. So we presume H2 is 37.6 Ky.
We are so near the vertical plane of the north that the length in azimuth would be about the height. Some 600 ft. The altitude to be estiin stars, is take the good adjusted path length as 1.8° km.
Due to the excessively small angular size the true length can be a surprise at only 4.8 meters, the size observed 3.69' and the end result is even more 3.1 It is exposed that die to the original tr bodies 'distant remain' into many, to describe effect different diameters to many a different end. However, the 1822 length and the given H1 and H2 still remain the coordinates of the atmospherics path.
As to the velocity in our 7? observed, we have 28 estimated run-ning from 6 min. Curve'ly: range 26 m/sec. Again dropping those of under 26 and over 90 sec. n= 63 m.sec. Using the unusually full reports from 89 55 sec., 340 45 sec., and 270 50 sec., the mean would be 46.2 sec. 'this means the observed velocity would be 23 m/sec, and the greatest is most probable 24 m/sec, an estimate not improbable. The distances are so short that the relio:)ne precision is the rate and most improbable. The criteria are so 3.1° that no doubt the step-tan, the arc cur- tions of over 10 second, estimated directions are a doubt to report.
However, in oeneral 1 report remarkably, noiline that. Some further data south report 3 objects report, to the oldest about mid Boon.

Dear Col. Quintanilla:

Your letter of July 2 reached me. recently.

Such calculations as the 6:25 of the annual report of the American Meteor Society. Jut I am sorry to say that I do not have copies of the 1968 annual report of the American Meteontical Society. I shall be happy to send you a copy if I can obtain one. This appearance even more keen here. I am sure that I should, though so far I have been very fortunate.

The above informs you can publish this article to the Blue Book for the report which would be distributed to you and others and dated 1936. The actual finished article is in my desk at U- * I will probably not see these until middle or next week. You are prohibited from publishing, circulating or quoting this article in any way until given permission. Please do not use the tabular data for any purpose.

The actual sub-sent point: due to the changing fortunes of this Bureau which E consider so difficult, I am very anxious that we continue to avoid any publication or inquiries from institutions other than our own. Thank you again for all the valuable reports which I return herewith. Please return this letter in conclusion.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Col.Quintanilla:

As last I have made a full reluotion for the atmospheric path of the 1958 March 5 object, which I have been informed was the sighuing of a certain USAF missile.

Also for this curiosity I have made a solution of it's orbit, as it appears to be quite irregular and of low altitude.

As you may know, many of the reports came from the Philade;phia area if you would like to publish this solution in the next Bluebook release, it would be about 300-800 words of text, as I guess.

A publication may not be feasible due to security regulations, but I thought you should have this for your files. In any event, I have nothing on the 12 April ob3ect of which you write.

Dear Col.Quintanilla:
Very many thanks for the "translation on Chinese Meteor Showers"
which have just come and necessarily looked over. It do not have it and am most happy to
receive it. It is very interesting.
Incidentally, it is too bad that their so-called government is so hostile to us,as I do not think old enough to remember how many times AGC and was the best friend China had and gave them back all this money they paid for damages.
I have a path worked out for the March 25/ object on which you sent me a letter. This is workable reports that take care of April 6 and 13 and they are satellites. It was a meteor or reentry as satellite was at 3:20.5 east, if you have a century listed for data, please let me know as it seems listed for early date.
O.S.I. over general region long-lag L.W int. 55W. Three reports came in from planes, sent by NORAD to Denver. Do you by chance have any reports of on their ?50 they would be most gratefully received.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1963
Conversation with Greater Pittsburgh Airport, Office of Information, indicated that: 
had observed an unidentified flying object on the night of 3 March 1963. Three lines of fire with all defining characteristics of meteor observation: bright enough to light up the area, lasted 10-15 seconds, and disappeared at the horizon.
On 5 March 1963 we attempted to contact Mr.   , however, he was not in. We will call us on 6 March.
On 6 March 1963 Mr.   called the Aerial Phenomena Office. He said that on the night of 3 March 1963 he had observed an object in the southeastern sky at about 2115 hours. He said that at first there were three objects, the one broke into a shower of four objects, like a bridge of flames. They were heading from the south to north, main NNW. He stated that the objects were travelling extremely fast, so fast that they were possibly exhaust but then they became elongated so as to resemble a 30-7 Second like the main object's tail could cover the length of a mile. When the objects disappeared in the north they were flying almost in perfect line abreast. When the front one broke into two the others more or less seemed to shorten, break up and disappear. It disappeared as if they would into the clouds. The visibility was excellent that night. Mr.   could have seen them for a wide angle. He thought Mr.   observed a satellites decay.

Aerial Phenomena Office
Dear Sirs:
This morning our local paper carried a request for a sighting of a "UFO" on March 3. 
On that date at 10:10 PM my husband and I saw a large falling firebell in the southern sky at approximately 45° from the horizon. It was a large fireball with a long tail and it wavered in its path as if the object could be rolling. 
I saw it as it started to burn and called my husband across the room. It lasted about forty five seconds and burned out as we watched. There was no sound.
I have been watching for a request in the papers because I did not know where to send such information.

is about 30 miles from Berlin,

was as a small community called Gorman's
Valley on route 146 north of Deerfield,
N.H. when out ahead of us (the
way we were going north on route 146)
about 3 or 4 miles away was this
object that looked (to the human eye)
about the size of a small car. It
appeared to be going the same direction
we were traveling and about 2 miles
off the ground. It had a steady light
about the color of a mercury vapor light,
but considerably more brilliant in intensity.
That's the main thing I remember, that
it was exceptionally bright.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed memo for record. The memo describes a UFO observation that occurred on 3 March 1968 between 9:45 pm and 10:00 pm. The memo states that several objects (at least 6) were observed in the sky in the NE area, and that they would definitively have crossed a N-S line south of the airport. The duration of the observation was one minute and thirty seconds. The observer was at an elevation of 20-25 degrees above the horizon (about 5 degs above the moon) and the visibility was clear. The observer only saw the object for thirty seconds because he had to issue a clearance, and when he looked at it again, it had disappeared, so he turned to do something else since the object was passing out of sight due to the distance.

Dear Sir,

This will reply to your letter of March 14, 1968, in which you described an unidentified flying object (UFO) that you observed.

Without additional supporting information, we cannot offer an explanation of the object you saw. However, if you will complete the attached 'Report of Unidentified Flying Objects', our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base will be able to investigate the matter further.

Should you ever sight another UFO, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force Base. Each base has a UFO investigator who is in a better position to make an on-the-spot investigation which usually results in a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, we are sending you some literature that may be of interest and which you may find useful in reporting it to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

S.F.C. president

Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen:

I have what appears to be of considerable importance to the U.S. and to any government which is interested in sightings of unidentified aerial objects. 

On the night of March 3, 1968, a young couple, the Lewinskys, observed an object in the sky which they stated was approximately 315 meters in length and about 60 meters in height. It appeared to be a very brilliant illumination which seemed to be making an erratic flight path. At one point, it came to an apparent stop and then resumed motion. The object was observed for about 9:20 - 9:40 P.M.

While the viewing was not as scientifically detailed as would be desired, it was very clear and extended over a fairly long period of time, with the object being viewed from several angles. The observers are reliable individuals who have no tendency toward hallucination or hoaxes.

I believe this sighting may be of considerable interest and importance to your office. I would appreciate any response that you may care to make regarding the matter.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

According to the text in the image, the key points are:

"These objects were observed about 9:40 P.M. - 10:00 P.M. on March 6, 1968 in the eastern sky over Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.

There were about 30-40 lights in the sky - some appeared larger and brighter than others. The objects remained in the sky for about 20 minutes.

The witness described the lights as being 'about a mile apart', 'not too high up', and 'not too far away'. The objects were also described as 'very distinct' and 'quite bright'.

The lights did not blink or move during the sighting, but suddenly disappeared. The witness stated that they could not explain what the objects were."

Text from the document:

Dear Sirs - 
I am presently enrolled as a student at Bethany College, Bethany, West Virginia. At approximately 9:30 pm Sunday night, 3 March 1968, my roommate and I observed a curious sight in the western sky from our residence. 
We initially noticed two bright objects approaching from the west at high speed. As they appeared to be in pursuit of each other, one object seemed to be traveling at a higher or greater speed than the one pursued. The objects were observed intensely, and looked as if it was maneuvering and attempting to shoot the other one down. The four objects then passed behind some trees and the gymnasium, by which time they were receding and diminishing in distance.
I mention this to two fellow residents who were coming up the walk. If references or witnesses be needed.

- page 276 -

The image contains a handwritten document with a diagram. The diagram depicts various shapes labeled as "moving object", "apparent object", and "actual object". The text describes an observation of "bombera flying over Bethany mountains" that occurred on March 13, 1952 and lasted for approximately 60,000 ft or above, with the objects being invisible to the naked eye. The document also mentions weather conditions at the time of the observation.

By the OCR:

UFO Observation, March 3, 1968

1. Your letter of March 4, 1968 to Dr. Hynek has been received at the Project Blue Book Office. Unfortunately, in this particular instance, we were unable to obtain enough accurate reports so that the identity of the source of the sighting could be quickly verified. We received reports from Indianapolis, Richmond, Dayton, Xenia, Columbus, Pittsburgh, some small towns in Massachusetts of Pittsburgh.

2. The Space Detection Center, at Colorado Springs, was aware that a place of satellite lights was transpiring our atmosphere and was especially vigilant during this time. Because of visual observations, such as yours, it was determined that this was a recurrent phenomenon, normal in scope, and it was determined to be the remains of a satellite or satellites which apparently failed to reenter properly in some area either over the northeastern United States or southern New York, if the fragment survived reentry. We have not been successful in recovering the fragment, but we are hoping that it will turn up when people start hiking in some of the off beaten trails in that area.

3. On behalf of the Air Force, let me thank you for submitting your report to Project Blue Book. Your report will be added to our satellite reentry behavior data base.

WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO 45433

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: ASGS/S-5552                    11 April 1968

SUBJECT:  Reported Sighting - UFO

TO:        FTD (Dr. A. J. Cacioppo - TDGS)

1. The attached letter from Charles W. Inglet of the National
Cash Register Company is self-explanatory. Also attached is a
clipping from the Dayton Journal Herald of Thursday, March 7, 1968.

2. I am submitting this material to you since the reported sighting
has a broader implication than a normal UFO. It is apparent that the
objects were space objects with high behavioral characteristic being of
particular interest.

3. I know Mr. Inglet very well through many close community
associations with him over the past eight to ten years. He is the 
Director of Community Relations for NCR, and highly professional in
the areas of government (national, state and local), political science,
organizational and business administration. I consider him as one of
the most capable individuals that I know - outstandingly articulate,
intellectual and exceptionally well versed in national and interna-
tional and complex administrative problems. He has degrees of BA
and MA in Government from Oklahoma University, and has done addi-
tional graduate work at Northwestern. He is of unquestioned integrity
and a very staunch friend, close associate and supporter of the Air
Force.

4. I have discussed this sighting with him. His principal
interest in reporting this sighting is to provide his observations as to
the maneuvering character of the objects and that it was not just another UFO
sighting. Recognizing that the characteristics of the sighting correspond
to a large degree with the probability that some type of space objects
were observed, it was his desire to bring the particular maneuvering
aspects of such objects to the attention of the Air Force.

5. The following particular points were brought out in the discussion
with Mr. *****. [This name has been redacted].

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report containing text.

Contrary to the article in the Dayton Journal Herald, the objects were moving north-ward instead of east.

b. As described in his letter and as brought out in the discussion, the objects changed course, first northwestward and then back toward the northeast.

c. The direction of his travel by car on I-75 was essentially straight and northward, although changes in the direction of his travel was admitted as a possible reason for observing an apparent maneuver in the travel of such objects, his reaction was that any recognized curvature in the section of I-75 being travelled at the time of the sighting would not account for the maneuvers.

d. Curvature noted in the tails extending back from the objects would correspond to the observed maneuvering.

e. The relative positions of the objects were not observed to change in such maneuvers.

f. I am bringing this matter directly to your attention for reasons of overall ETD interests in the implications of the maneuvering characteristics of the objects observed.

Extracted text from the document:

EXPLANATION OF
WEATHER PHENOMENA
Weather phenomena are the chief source of UFO reports, and every effort should be made to discover their probable explanation. The atmospheric effects that are often seen are many and varied. The surface and structure of the atmosphere are constantly undergoing change, with temperature, pressure, moisture, and wind velocity all subject to continuous variation at all levels. The atmospheric conditions that may lead to the appearance of UFO's are frequently the result of the complex interplay of all these factors.

The letter - "WW" - is understood as meaning "Weather Watch", and the symbols are used to describe various atmospheric conditions and their associated descriptions.

The lower part of the document presents a grid with various numbered descriptors that correspond to different weather-related phenomena, along with their descriptions.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

OF THE WEATHER
The boundary of any clouding affecting the weather may be indicated by a distinct line of demarcation in the sky. This boundary may be well defined and show abrupt changes in cloud formation. Frequently, however, the boundary is not well defined, and the change from one type of cloud to another is gradual. When this is the case, the boundary zone must be described rather than an exact line. The boundary of the clouding may be observed at the ground as well as in the sky. The clouds often show marked differences in thickness, density, and texture on opposite sides of the boundary. Surfaces fronts are drawn to indicate these differences.

DESCRIPTION
I - Scattered - up to 2/10 sky covered. 
2 - Scattered - 3 to 4/10 sky covered. 
3 - Broken - 5 to 7/10 sky covered.
4 - Broken - 8 to 9/10 sky covered.
5 - Overcast - 10/10 sky covered.
6 - Partial obscuration - partially obscured.
7 - Sky obscured - totally obscured.
8 - Indefinite ceiling - ceiling not definite.
9 - Sky clear of clouds - no cloud coverage.

Flaming Objects Seen by Many
Traced to a Soviet Space Shot

BY WALTER SULLIVAN
At about 6:45 P.M., Eastern Standard Time on March 8, a woman in Indiana looked out a window and saw a procession of seven or eight flaming objects in the sky.
Two or three minutes later, she reported the sight to the United States Air Force the next day. Many others had reported similar phenomena.
"It was at about treetop level," she said, "and was just a few yards away." The continued. "All of the observers saw the objects at varying angles, and from vehicles with both in front and behind. All the observers also say many with them.
The woman in Ohio told how she had put her children to bed and then returned outside to sweep trash cans in her driveway and whispered. "She was startled."
The woman, although she had slept 10 hours the night before, said the flaming object did not scare her or power her drive to sleep." She had the same experience after seeing it two times the previous evening.
In Tennesse, a woman reported that she saw one of the objects, and it seemed to be a lighted craft with radiating metal fins glowing and what seemed to be a pointed metal nose. The oblong of some kind was estimated to be about 1,000 feet overhead. The observers saw the Air Force "fly over the scene" later, and the security officer said the vehicle could have been only a Soviet space shot that the United States knew about. It was subsequently determined that the object was a part of the Zond 4 Soviet space probe that had been launched that day after a daylight launch the day before. A Soviet Union announced on March 9 that Zond 4 had been placed in the proper position for launching into returning to the Earth's atmosphere.
Some thought it may have been photographed the moon and return to the Soviet union, but apparently the mission was unsuccessful. An Air Defense Command confirmed its assessment that the objects observed in the eastern United States were debris from the Zond 4 launch.

FLYING SAUCER IS TRACED TO SPACE SHOT BY SOVIET
Continued From Page 1, Col. 3
WASHINGTON, July 1, — The U.S. Air Force said today that a reported flying saucer sighting in Ohio and several other areas was traced to a space shot launched by the Soviet Union.
The Air Force said a Satellite-tracking team had actually identified the bright lights seen in the sky over Lexington, Ky., and Pittsburg, Pa., as the rocket stages of a Soviet satellite launched on May 1, 1968. This satellite is designated Cosmos 216.
The office has been piecing together the details of the incident, which came in the wake of a nationwide sighting on June 15. The office said the June 15 sighting, which received wide TV and newspaper coverage, also has been identified as a natural phenomenon - probably the re-entry of a Soviet satellite.
The Air Force said there have been several other recent incidents in which U.F.O. reports have been traced to space shots or natural phenomena.
It said the latest Ohio "sighting" was the result of a March 6 Soviet space shot that released a rocket stage on re-entry. A number of the reports received in that case, it said, could be attributed to seeing the re-entry of that missile stage.
In the Ohio case, the office said, the Air Force received several reports, some of them from police departments, that a bright object had been sighted in the sky, apparently descending. It said these reports were received over a wide area, including Dayton and Portsmouth, Ohio.
After investigation, the office said, it was able to identify the object as the rocket casing of a Soviet satellite launched on March 6, 1968, which had re-entered the atmosphere on that date over the Ohio area.
The office said it reached this conclusion after a study of satellite-tracking reports and information developed by the U.S. Air Force Satellite Control Facility and the North American Air Defense Command.
The Air Force said the Ohio sighting, like the June 15 nationwide incident, had stimulated a large number of enquiries and reports to the U.F.O. office. It said that in both cases, its investigators were able to trace the sightings to natural causes.

Transcription of text from the document:

"HEADQUARTERS of ASTRONAUTICS, July, '68

This section of the office has lately received from various sources information concerning UFOs or "flying saucers". From time to time we receive such reports, but usually they are of a nature not to warrant any official investigation or action. Most of the reports received recently, however, deal with a rather large number of such objects over the Northeastern United States, and we feel that a brief report on the nature of these recent reports would be of interest.

These reports, which have come in steadily over the past eight years, generally describe circular or disc-shaped objects, some of which have been observed to land and take off again. In a few instances, the objects have been seen to emit beams of light, apparently for illumination purposes, and in one case, the object was reported to have extended some form of appendage.

Some of these objects have been observed by military and civilian personnel, and in a few cases photographs have been taken, which have been submitted to higher authorities. We have received the reports that these photographs are inconclusive and do not prove the existence of "flying saucers". The objects described, when seen, seem to move with considerable speed and maneuverability, often in an erratic fashion that would be difficult to duplicate with any known type of aircraft.

While these reports are of interest, it is felt that no immediate or drastic action is warranted at this time. The matter will be kept under constant surveillance, and any developments of a more tangible nature will be promptly reported. For the present, it is considered that the reported objects, while unusual, do not present any immediate threat, and our present investigations indicate that they are probably of a natural phenomenon not yet fully understood, rather than indications of any hostile intent or action."

Flaming Objects Seen by Many Traced to a Soviet Space Shot
By WALTER SULLIVAN
At about 9:45 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on March 8 a woman in Indiana looked out of her window and saw a strange sight - a series of fiery objects fly past in the sky.
She reported to the United States Air Force that she had seen, along with her cousin, a number of fiery objects moving rapidly through the sky, she said. The woman, who asked not to be identified, tying to tell me about the U.F.O.'s (unidentified flying objects) they had watched.
It was at about treetop level, she said, and was seen very clearly and was moving away, she continued. "All of a sudden they just flew out of sight. We could not make out any wings. It was on fire and seemed to be burning. All in a formation as they flew down in the U.F.O.'s."
A woman in Ohio told how the objects she had seen, which had passed over, had lain between 6 and 17 minutes in her driveway and had frightened to death.
The woman, although she had all along been skeptical about U.F.O.'s, said she had had "an overpowering desire to stop" and was "feeling a U.F.O. is 1968."
In Tennessee, a woman reported to the United States Air Force that she had seen, along with her cousin, a number of fiery objects moving rapidly through the sky, she said. The woman, who asked not to be identified, was apparently telling the truth. For Air Force experts have now concluded that the objects she saw were not U.F.O.'s but were part of the firing of a Soviet satellite into space.
The Air Force said that on March 8 the Soviet Union had launched a satellite and during the firing of the upper stage of the rocket, fiery pieces of the rocket were apparently seen from the ground by observers in several states as the rocket stage reentered the atmosphere in a spectacular display.
The Aerial Photographic Interpretation Center of the Air Force has determined that the objects seen in Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee on March 8 were not U.F.O.'s but were in fact parts of the Soviet satellite launching.
Meanwhile, the Aerial Photographic Interpretation Center of the Air Force has determined that the objects seen in Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee on March 8 were not U.F.O.'s but were in fact parts of the Soviet satellite launching.

in the air. Another said that 72 perons on the ground told the Air Force that they saw the object.
In 1968 the U.S. Air Force launched a Thor-Agena satellite into the skies with the U.F.O. visit. A science magazine, which told of this incident, said, "The official conclusion is that this 'flying saucer' was identical to the U.F.O. with a Satellite-tracking antenna on its nose."
The U.F.O. reports are channeled through the United Air Lines office in Denver, which channels them to the Federal Aviation Agency in Washington, which in turn channels them to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, known as NICAP, in Washington. NICAP is a private organization that collects pilot and other U.F.O. reports.
Despite the March flurry of reports, Air Force officials said yesterday that the over-all rate of sightings has remained about normal for the last four years. In Washington, a spokesman for the Air Force said the office had received only 19 reports by the end of March, compared to 77 during the same period last year.
The Air Force, however, says it keeps no statistics on sightings, although the Air Defense Command's monitoring stations do receive some calls. The Air Force says it investigates only those reports that come through proper Defense Department channels.
There was also a slight drop in reported U.F.O. episodes in Michigan and other states during 1967 compared to the previous three years, according to NICAP. The agency has received 196 reports since Jan. 1, 1968, of which 176 have been identified as aircraft,
satellites, planets, stars or other known objects. The remaining 20, covering the period from 1964 to the present, are still under study.

Dear Major Quintanilla:

Two letters from you March 18 are another result from an earlier communication from your AFB will now require.

First: object of 1967 Oct.27- Report from Blytheville, ARK, on subject above said report..... 

Second: Report by description of 1968 Feb.25 20:02 G.M.T. Observations were recorded by three observers of which I was one, at the Flower and Cook Observatory in the University of Pennsylvania. The pilot say it 'all erratically' on Bearing 165 at Elevation 10 degrees 24 minutes. Due to large difference in longitude it could hardly have been same.

Third, unknown object of 1968 March 6 at somewhere near 9:40 p.m. E.S.T. As I merely see it as a report in the press I have no further details concerning it, but questions arise.

Sincerely yours,

Transcribed text:

Sighting of fireballs. On March 3rd at about 6:30 p.m. Eastern Standard time, James L. Whitley, William Doelling, and Barbara Dodson, Wilmington, Delaware, observed two bright, fast-moving objects. Moving slowly from southwest to northeast, there were two of these objects which disappeared in about 13 seconds, finally breaking up and disappearing rapidly in about 2 seconds, from northern horizon to south.

It was only two objects of magnitude C, as per Dr. J.R. Winn. Having an angular size of 30 minutes of arc. If these were astronomical objects, this size would make them between 40 to 50 feet in diameter.

The intensity was that of a 1st magnitude star. The frequency is unexplained. The origin is also unexplained.

The use of a telescope revealed no detail, merely increasing the size of the object slightly.

This sighting has been the subject of much investigation by the Center.

When called from Wright-Patterson AFB, A.F. D.D. on Div. F. AF was unable to elicit much information re: this or any other sighting. Due to inability, if seen different object(s) or watch it travel. We could well account for this since we know lights alone can be deceiving and it is natural for witnesses to "be careful" as to height, course & speed, etc. of object. It is quite understandable that they would be somewhat evasive or reticent in reporting details of an incident of this nature.

AF Identifies UFO's
An Air Force spokesman at the Pentagon disclosed today that the Air Force has identified three objects sighted over the Washington area on Sunday as air force aircraft. Sightings were made in a widely-spaced area of the sky but all three objects were identified as air force planes. The spokesman said the Air Force is conducting an investigation to determine why the objects were mistaken for unidentified flying objects. The sightings occurred between 8:30 p.m. and midnight Sunday, he said.

MEMO FOR RECORD
5 March 1968

SUBJECT: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968 

Between 0945 and 0950 pm EST numerous observers in the Indiana, Ky., Ohio, and West Virginia areas sighted several whitish lights that appeared to have reddish red tails. The majority of the observers stated that there were 3 (three) objects and that they were traveling in a NE direction. The objects were sighted by numerous ground observers and also by several aircraft pilots. Indianapolis ground observers stated that the objects were blinking but did not emit any objects that could be correlated to the UFOs. The Space Detection Center reported that they were quite certain that the sighting was the result of the decay or Space debris into the earth's atmosphere.

The image appears to contain a blank form, likely from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The form includes various sections for the observer to fill out details about the sighting, such as the location, direction of movement, and duration of the phenomenon. However, there is no photograph or image included in this particular page.

Transcript of the text:

Data you can-review this questionnaire: 17 MARCH 1968
1. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

As I have stated earlier, I have never seen a jet trail on it after the sighting. There was no sound. The object stooped the year end, a distance of several miles, and there was no sound. There were several details for sound of the "jet" plane. There were no sound. I must emphasize that very strongly.

Here is the text contained in the document:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass rose to show the direction that you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass rose to show the direction that you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and allow any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

THE NATIONAL CASH REGISTER COMPANY
DAYTON, OHIO 45409

March 4, 1968

Dr. John E. Keto
Chief Scientist
Aeronautical Systems Division
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio 45433

Dear Dr. Keto:

I have the impression that Project Blue Book often has some difficulty in ascertaining whether a UFO sighting has come from a credible witness. Hoping not to add to your many problems, I must submit the narrative below to you, in the hope that you will pass it along to the responsible authorities; and I shall depend on you as the first witness as to whether I am insane, or highly imaginative, or otherwise unreliable.

At approximately 9:30 p.m. Sunday, March 3, 1968, I was driving alone northward from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Dayton, Ohio, on Interstate Route 75, at a speed of approximately 65-70 miles per hour. Due north and directly ahead of me I sighted three objects which, so far as I can ascertain, were unidentified flying objects.

These three objects were flying in a more or less perfect formation, with one substantially in the lead and the other two close together, side by side, at the rear. Where first sighted, they were approximately 45 degrees from the horizontal surface on which I was traveling. The objects appeared to me to be flying at a very high speed and at a very high altitude. I could not ascertain, with absolute certainty, whether they were flying horizontally or whether they were ascending or descending, but the angle at which I saw them was essentially high, the objects displaying no perceptible change in their relationship to the horizontal surface of the earth while I was observing them. Therefore, considering that I was behind them and considering their speed, they could have been flying horizontally or they could have been descending, toward the horizon.

The sky was quite dark. I could not ascertain the shape or size of the objects themselves. (The reason for my being able to see them was the fact that they were silhouetted against the sky, moving in a direction toward the front. The foremost point of each tall protrusion was the object itself, which I could not see at all.

- page 356 -

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter describing the observation of three unidentified objects in flight.

Dr. John E. Keto 
March 4, 1968

I watched these three objects in flight for approximately five minutes. I watched intermittently in order to be able to continue to watch the road and drive safely. At the end of that time, after a period of watching the road and traffic around me, I looked up again and noted that the three objects were no longer in sight.

Two characteristics of these objects interest me especially: 
(1) The tail extending back from each object was distinctly golden in color, and therefore was unlike the jet exhaust or rocket engine I have ever seen before.
(2) The three objects, flying in a consistent formation, executed a distinct curve in their flight path. This was unmistakable: the lead object first entered the curve, swinging out toward the left (west) horizon; and then the following two objects followed the same curving course; then the three of them straightened out again toward the north-northeast. At one point in this trajectory, each till was unmistakable.

I should appreciate it if you will pass this information along to Blue Book, with any comments you might care to make. If it should be useful to the Air Force in any way, I should be glad to reconfirm these details in an interview.

Many thanks, and best wishes,
Sincerely,

MEMO FOR RECORD
4 March 1968

SUBJECT: Satellite Decay, 4 March 1968 (1420 hrs)

We are quite certain this was a piece of debris from the USSR launch ZOND-4 which is the most recent launch. It, the debris, was about 15 minutes ahead of the main pieces of the launch. We have as visuals, but are putting ground tracers on it. All observers, from SAO, had reports from Louiseville, Kentucky.

Lt Barlett suggested that we state that it was debris without reference to origin. However, if asked directly we could certainly call them that it was debris from ZOND-4 and that it was of Russian origin.

March 5, 1968
Greenfield, Ohio

Director
Museum of Natural History
1720 Gilbert Street
Cincinnati, Ohio

DEAR SIR:

This letter concerns my witnessing the U.F.O. sighting last Sunday night while crossing the bridge over Weston Lake, south of Greenfield.
I noticed a large glow in the sky to the west. As it came closer I noticed that this was not a plane. There were no signs of lights four to six in number, evenly spaced, with trails similar to meteors. I requested the lady cab driver to pull over so I could get a better look.
As I got out of the car, the object passed directly overhead, moving rapidly. The lights and trails did not diminish or change. There was no sound. The cab driver and her eight year old daughter watched these lights with me. They agree to the above and feel this was a person who has amateur experience in stars and night observations. It is suggested that I contact this number to think this was authentic. Common sense suggests to me that this was a space flight.

Personal note: I am not a kook or individual prone to imagination. I feel this is worth your investigation.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

The objects may have impacted the earth shortly after the last reported sighting in the Pittsburgh area.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
5 March 1968
Subject: UFO Observation, 3 March 1968.
It Marano spoke with Captain Shea, SAFOP at 1300 hours regarding release of information on the UFO report of 3 March. Captain Shea informed Lt Marano that the whole question on the release of the information on this sighting was coming more and more complicated.
He said that NORAD is reluctant to say that this is a piece of ZOND -4. NORAD won't buy the fact that it is positively ZOND-4. Kitchens from NORAD doesn't want to say this. Lt Marano informed Capt Shea that Lt Earlett had said "We are quite certain that this is a piece of debris from the USSR launch ZOND-4 which is the most recent launch. It, the debris, was about 16 minutes ahead of the main pieces of the launch. We have no visuals, but are putting ground tracers on it. Al Waters, from SAO, had reports from Australia, Kentucky," Shea said he could say that to DOD.
He says they are having problems with NASA and Kitchens. Lt Marano gave Capt Shea the following short brief description that could be used in place of the previous release given to Shea earlier today.
"On March 3, 1968, between 9:45 and 9:50 pm, EST, numerous observers in the Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania area sighted several objects which appeared to have orangish-red tails. The majority of the observers stated that there were three objects traveling in a northeast direction. These objects were sighted by numerous ground observers and also by several aircraft pilots. Indianapolis FAA Center was notified at the time of the sighting but did not make any objects on radar that could be correlated to the UFOs. The Space Detection Center reported that they were certain that the sightings were the result of the decay of space debris into the earth's atmosphere, and it is believed that these objects may have originated from the Soviet Union."

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire with various questions related to the sighting of an unidentified object.

20. Do you think you can estimate the speed of the object? (Circle One) Yes No IF you answered YES, then what speed would you estimate?

21. Do you think you can estimate how far away from you the object was? (Circle One) Yes No IF you answered YES, then how far away would you say it was?

22. Where were you located when you saw the object? (Circle One) a. inside a building b. in a car c. Outdoors d. in an airplane (type) e. At sea f. Other

23. Were you (Circle One) a. In the business section of a city? b. In the residential section of a city? c. In open countryside? d. Near an airfield? e. Flying over a city? f. Flying over open country?

24. IF you were MOVING IN AN AUTOMOBILE or other vehicle at the time, then complete the following questions: 24.1. What direction were you moving? (Circle One) a. North b. Northeast c. East d. Southeast e. South f. Southwest g. West h. Northwest 24.2. How fast were you moving? miles per hour. 24.3. Did you stop at any time while you were looking at the object? (Circle One) Yes No

Transcribed text from the document:

AS SOUND SOME VERY STRANGE
10. WE WISH TO KNOW THE ANGULAR SIZE, HOLD A MATCH STICK AT ARMS LENGTH IN LINE WITH A KNOWN OBJECT AND NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE HEAD OF THE MATCH. IF YOU HAD DESCRIBED THIS EXPERIMENT TO US, COULD YOU KINDLY DO SO AGAIN AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD?
19. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OR COLOR OF THE OBJECT OR OBJECTS. LABEL AND INCLUDE IN YOUR SKETCH ANY UNUSUAL OR EVIDENT CHARACTERISTICS, FOR EXAMPLE, VAPOR TRAILS. PLACE AN ARROW BESIDE THE DRAWING TO SHOW THE DIRECTION THE OBJECT WAS MOVING.
20. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN ESTIMATE THE SPEED OF THE OBJECT? (CIRCLE ONE) YES NO IF YOU ANSWERED YES, THEN WHAT SPEED WOULD YOU ESTIMATE?

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document containing a questionnaire with text responses.

As an OCR system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

23. DRAW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE MOTION THAT THE OBJECT OR OBJECTS MADE. PLACE AN "X" AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PATH, A DASH AT THE END OF THE PATH, AND SHOW ANY CHANGES IN DIRECTION DURING THE COURSE.  

29. IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE OBJECT, THEN HOW MANY WERE THERE? 
DRAW A PICTURE OF HOW THEY WERE ARRANGED, AND PUT AN ARROW TO SHOW THE DIRECTION THAT THEY WERE TRAVELLING.

30. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS, OR A SIMILAR OBJECT BEFORE. IF SO GIVE DATE OR DATES AND LOCATION.

31. WAS ANYONE ELSE WITH YOU AT THE TIME YOU SAW THE OBJECT? (CIRCLE ONE)   YES   NO

The image contains a photograph or diagram showing the sighting of an unidentified phenomenon. It appears to be a form or questionnaire used by the U.S. Air Force project Blue Book to collect information about UFO sightings. The diagram shows the observer's perspective and an illustration of the observed object's position and movement relative to the horizon.

THIS QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PREPARED SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING YOUR OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. PLEASE ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS. THE INFORMATION YOU GIVE WILL BE USED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY AND WILL BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL. ACCORDING TO CURRENT REGULATIONS, THE AIR FORCE IS REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE ALL REPORTS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS. YOUR COOPERATION IN COMPLETING THIS QUESTIONNAIRE WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. IN ADDITION TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE, PLEASE SUBMIT ANY PHOTOGRAPHS, MOVIES, OR SKETCHES THAT PERTAIN TO THE SIGHTING. IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION NOT COVERED BY THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, PLEASE ATTACH A SEPARATE SHEET.

The image contains two illustrations. The larger illustration is a compass with directional indicators, likely used to determine the direction of an observed object. The smaller illustrations depict a person's perspective from the ground, showing a wide landscape view. There are no identifiable humans in the illustrations.

TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENlER OF THE COMPASS NOISE. PLACE AN X ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
YOU REPORTED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OECJECT WHICH FIRST SEEN. PLACE A AT ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
WHICH THE OBJECT MOVED.

7. THE SKETCH BELOW, AND A MAP AT THE TOP POSITION, WILL AID IN DESCRIBING THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A MAP AT THE
BOTTOM WILL HELP IN DESCRIBING THE SUBSEQUENT COURSE OR MOTION OF THE OBJECT. CAREFULLY STUDY THESE SKETCHES UNTIL YOU UNDER-
STAND THEM COMPLETELY. THEN DRAW ON THE GRID BELOW AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE SKETCHES TO SHOW WHAT YOU OBSERVED
IN THE LARGER SKETCH.
