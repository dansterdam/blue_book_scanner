UFOB INDEX CARD
AIRS-UFOB-251-55
1. DATE: 22-4-1955
2. LOCATION: San Diego, California
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 01/0507Z August 1955
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: a. Ground-Visual
b. Air-Visual
5. SOURCE: Civilian (GOC) 
6. NUMBER OF OBSERVERS: Three
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Approx twenty (20) Minutes
8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: One and sometimes three objects. There appears to be two small objects to the observer, which rotated around a larger object. These changing to yellow. Appeared and disappeared in the NW.
11. COMMENTS: Due to the age and probable inaccuracies of the observer the veracity of the data contained can be doubted. It is possible that while looking thru binoculars at a star the objects could attain color in the binoculars and appear to move, the binoculars and any slight movement would tend to give movement to the object. The fact that the object remained in the same position would tend to support the star theory.

Foreign UFO sightings are generally difficult or impossible to thoroughly investigate or evaluate. They should be considered as reflecting some interest on the part of foreign countries in this phenomena, rather than as providing any real evidence in support of the existence of extraterrestrial vehicles.
