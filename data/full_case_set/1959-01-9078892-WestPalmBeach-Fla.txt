SEVERAL RESIDENTS OF WEST PALM BEACH, FLA., REPORTED SEEING A FIERY OBJECT STREAK ACROSS THE SKY LAST NIGHT. THIS HAPPENED SHORTLY AFTER THE LAUNCHING OF AN ATLAS MISSILE FROM CAPE CANAVERAL. THE OBJECT HAD A LONG, VAPOROUS TAIL.
A BALL OF FIRE WAS REPORTED BY SEVERAL PERSONS TO HAVE PLUNGED INTO THE BAY AT MOBILE, ALA. AUTHORITIES SAID NO PLANES WERE KNOWN TO HAVE CRASHED IN THE AREA, AND NO EXPLANATION WAS GIVEN.
