3. The sighting was reported to the Air Force authorities, and investigation was ordered. No further information is available.

This image does not contain any photograph or visual information other than the text on the document. The text in the document appears to be a "Statement of Robert L. Vick" from the U.S. Air Force, regarding an unidentified object observed on October 11, 1951 at Neubiberg Air Base in Germany. The document provides details about the observation and Vick's recollection of the event.

STATEMENT OF ROBERT L. VICK

AT 0815, hours local, 11 October 1951, I was standing in front of the 525th Fighter-Bomber Squadron Hangar at Neubiberg Air Base, AGO 65, US Air Force, when an object appeared in the sky overhead. The object was motionless and appeared somewhat egg-shaped, and was illuminated brilliantly as if light was being emitted from within. It remained in one spot or moved at an extremely slow rate for about 10 to 15 minutes, then disappeared from view. The object seemed to remain in one spot or moved at an extremely slow rate for about 10 to 15 minutes, then disappeared from view.

The object's appearance and behavior was extremely unusual and difficult to explain, especially since it hovered or remained in one spot and did not conform to the normal flight patterns of known aircraft. While I watched the object, I tried to get others to observe it, but only a few airmen joined me. I am unable to estimate the size or exact altitude of the object. I can only state that it appeared to be approximately the size of a pea held at arm's length, and that it was estimated to be at an altitude of several thousand feet.

This document was unclassified.

STATEMENT OF CARL E. LUCAS

AT 0845 on 11 October 1951, Sergeant Robert E. Vick called me from the control tower and stated he had observed an object in the sky. He swung his hand toward the southwest and instantly saw the object. It was about 2 miles distant and appeared to be at an altitude of about 5000 feet. It seemed to be metallic and had a dark center. As I watched, it seemed to oscillate or shimmer like a reflected light. After observing it for about thirty (30) odd seconds, I looked for about thirty (30) odd seconds and immediately left to get someone else. I did not see it again.
