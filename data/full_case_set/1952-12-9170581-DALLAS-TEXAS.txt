SUBJECT: DALLAS, TEXAS
DATE OF INCIDENT: 31 DECEMBER 1952
TIME OF INCIDENT: 1235CST
SUMMARY: (give details of incident. Use additional blank space if necessary. Expand any abbreviated words)
Automatic Gunlaying Radar set (similar to one half of a AN/APS-ll equipped with an APQ-13 installed in the nose under the bombardier's compartment) noted several bogies being tracked intermittently by the ATA of the AGC. Radar set for a period of approximately 90 minutes. Pilots of F-86's observed a flight of unknown objects which were identified by the ATC and ARTC radar sets. The flight plan and report are attached.
Although nothing could be seen by any of the members of the crew, the following facts are noted:
a. The phenomenon was detected by both radar sets.
b. The behavior of attempting to remain 3000 to 4000 yards in front of the F-86 during descent from 40,000 to 15,000 feet was unexplainable, and seemed to indicate that something intelligent was guiding it.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

ITEM: Phenomenon sighted at 12:15 EST (13:15Z), 21 Dec 52, intermittently for a 1-1/2 hour period or a total of 20 minutes. The phenomenon was observed on the radar at the various radar stations, and visual observations were taken by the personnel.

The image appears to contain a photograph, but it is not visible in the provided document. The text in the document describes an incident related to an AN/APG-11 indicator and some details about the maneuvers and behavior of the phenomenon observed. The text is provided below:

The scope face of the AN/APG-11 indicator was slightly out of focus, and the pictures that it gave the operator, took in a search do not show the phenomenon clearly. As the operator explained on the search, prolonged surveillance of the phenomenon on the APG-11 indicator produced no clear photograph.

Weather conditions: Immediate area was clear, nearest cloud formations were approximately 10 miles distant. There was a cloud deck below the B-36 at a low altitude.

An AN/APG-23 phenomenon was similar to recent AIFEC release of PPI photographs of sightings made over Washington, D.C. 

PPI photographs of AN/APG-11 scope are available. These are the G-15 films referred to and discussed in 3 above. These and the Krichen film referred to in 3-2 above will all be available in the Armament Procurement Engineering Building 22, Post 24A, Phone 20121 or 26235, and the office symbol is WCRGL-1.

The maneuvers consisted of turns, climbs, and dives (to the extent of the B-36's capabilities) so that they pointed towards a point in space traveling a path parallel and then suddenly disappearing with the air speed indicator on the B-36 indicating a speed of 2000 miles per hour. Whenever the B-36 established a new heading so that the phenomenon was estimated to be in front of the B-36 this new reading was so fast that the phenomenon was 2 or 3 miles ahead of the B-36 before they lost it. Then suddenly the phenomenon would reappear and the G-11 would again detect and lock on it. (see the AN/APG-11 operator's statement (item 8) for details.

No air traffic was observed in the Dallas area at the time of the electronic sighting.

DALLAS, TEXAS 
CASE NO. 675 
9 December 1952 

WITNESS:
WALLACE G. BRITTEN, 1825 Kessler Blvd., Dallas, Texas

SUMMARY:
Mr. Britten reports observing an unidentified flying object about 3:30 AM on 16 November 1952 near his home. The object was described as circular in shape, about 10-12 feet in diameter, and emitting a bright glow. It moved in a somewhat erratic manner and was observed for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing. No other witnesses were reported.

DETAILS:
Mr. Britten states that he was awake and looking out a window of his home at about 3:30 AM on 16 November 1952 when he observed a bright light in the sky. He states that the light seemed to move erratically, hovering and then darting about. 
He estimates the size of the object to be about 10-12 feet in diameter and circular in shape. He describes it as emitting a bright glow, illuminating the area around it.
Mr. Britten states that he watched the object for approximately 5 minutes before it suddenly disappeared from view. He reports no other witnesses to the incident.

EVALUATIONS:
This report has been evaluated and found to be of insufficient information to permit a definite evaluation. The description of the object and its movements are inconclusive. No other witnesses or physical evidence are available.

LAW:
This case is being forwarded to the U.S. Air Force for any additional information or evaluation that may be available.

Text from the document:

MARCH 8-
SUBJECT:REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING - DALLAS, TEXAS

1. The following report is submitted based on an interview with the observer, Mr. A. J. CROWDER, Dallas, Texas, on 7 March 1952:

2. On 9 December 1951, between 1930 and 2000 hours, Mr. CROWDER observed an unidentified object in the sky approximately 20 miles southwest of Dallas, Texas. The object was first observed by Mr. CROWDER while he was traveling west on U.S. Highway 80 between Dallas and Mesquite, Texas.

3. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: Mr. CROWDER reported that the object was disc-shaped, approximately 30 feet in diameter, and was completely silent in flight. He stated that the object appeared to be illuminated and emitted a yellowish-white glow. The object was estimated to be traveling at a speed of approximately 500 miles per hour.

4. FLIGHT OF OBJECT: Mr. CROWDER stated that the object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes and disappeared in an easterly direction. Upon first sighting the object, Mr. CROWDER stopped his automobile and observed the object for about 1 minute. He then continued his trip toward Dallas for approximately 1 mile, stopped his automobile again, and observed the object for an additional 1 to 2 minutes.

5. WEATHER CONDITIONS: Clear sky, with visibility estimated at 20 miles. No wind.

6. CONCLUSIONS: The reported sighting of an unidentified flying object by Mr. A. J. CROWDER is considered reliable and authentic. The description of the object coincides with reports of similar unidentified flying objects observed in this area within the past 12 months.

CONFIDENTIAL
SECURITY INFORMATION
SUBJECT: INVESTIGATION REPORT
1. GENERAL:
A total of 37,428 persons participated in the retrieval of 11 badly burned objects. It appears that these objects were a part of a meteor shower or the dispersal of an artificial satellite.
2. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECTS:
The objects, when retrieved, were extremely hot and in a deteriorated condition. The objects were dark in color, irregularly shaped, and seem to be composed of a light, brittle material. No positive identification of the material has been made.
3. LOCATION OF OBJECTS:
All other bases were notified to be on the alert for any other similar objects. No additional objects were located.
4. EXAMINATION OF OBJECT FRAGMENTS:
The object fragments were examined on an immediate basis to determine if they were of extraterrestrial origin. The examination was negative. There was no evidence to indicate that the objects were of anything other than natural origin.
RECOMMENDATION: Discontinue further investigation. The incident appears to have been the result of a natural phenomenon and does not warrant any further action.

SUBJECT: FLYOBRPT

Statement by AN/APA/11 operator on 21 day December 1952, Convair flight on ship 44-92054, type B-36:

While flight testing AN/APA/11 radar on nose of B-36 oh, 12-21-52, I encountered a spurious target during work with fighter aircraft. Thinking that it might be cloud trouble, I asked pilot (C. I. Davis) what kind of cloud cover we had around this region. He replied that there was none and the spurious target was still there. To confirm the return, I asked the pilot to turn the ship. The spurious target again triggered the ALG and made a very firm lock on. At this point I asked the ARC-33 operator for confirmation on target. He confirmed that he had seen spurious target at same range. The spurious target persisted from 2000 to 4000 yds but varying in azimuth of 60° to the right or left of the ship's course. It did not behave as you would expect if asked the pilot to maneuver the ship after lock on to prove trackability. This showed the target to be very stable and unaffected by maneuvering of the ship. I had spent some 30 minutes with this target and when I did turn off the set, the target stayed with us down to about 8,000 ft. At this point the target was no longer seen.

This target did not look like normal return that you get from other aircraft. The only thing that I have ever seen resembling it was spent 20 ml shell cases which I have tracked before on the APA/11. I am quite certain this target system in unknown.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, specifically the statement by an AN/APS-23 operator dated 24 December 1952 regarding a Convair flight.

The text of the document is as follows:

SUBJECT: FLYOBJECT

Statement by AN/APS-23 operator, 24 December 1952, Convair flight on 21-12-1952, type B-36.

The AN/APS-23 with C-l12 control is used as search radar on this airplane. At the time it was requested to aid in detecting the phenomenon I was in search position and was also informed that in level flight, search condition, the best ground return was obtained with -7 degrees antenna tilt. It then reduced range to the stock position which removed the five mile range mark from the scope, and upon this fact I was informed that the minimum range on the scope at 14.5 miles should be considered. A target then appeared coming from the 5 o'clock position and antenna tilt to zero position on scale the described targets began to appear. I then found my next targets range from were to 26 degrees.
Since the targets were in the same proximity as the AN/APS-41 had indicated, I also observed a more distinct outline in similar CFI attitude. In similar CFI attitude, I would say that they would be between 20 to 25 miles distant, they appeared to be locked on. The AN/APS-41 operator would call out range of lock on, and my range would be comparable to his. I detected a second target further out (approximately one mile), and on several occasions I could see another target to the right by 15 degrees either side of the one up the center. These targets were very sharp and bright, and followed it out of the scope and with RF gain could be turned very bright. However, they were unusual in the fact that they did not track but rather the edge of the scope but would appear on the scope at a range of two to four miles. They also might remain constant for several sweeps, and then the next sweep they would be gone. Several sweeps later they might again appear. In this manner they would disappear at the same time the AN/APS-41 would unlock.

RE: INCIDENT DEC. 9, 1952 DALLAS, TEXAS.

On the above date, I was in Dallas, Texas, on business. At about 2:30 P.M. I was stopped at a traffic light in the 2300 block of Main St. when I was attracted by a strange object in the sky. At first I thought it was an aircraft, but as I watched it, I realized it was not an aircraft of any type I had ever seen before. 
The object was round, or disc shaped, and appeared to be revolving or spinning. It was of a bright silvery color and seemed to be reflecting the sunlight. It was at an altitude of approximately 1000 to 1500 feet and was traveling in a northeasterly direction.
As I watched, the object suddenly accelerated at a terrific rate of speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. It did not leave a vapor trail or any other indication of its passing.
I immediately reported what I had seen to the Dallas Police Department. A report was taken, but I have not been able to ascertain if it was forwarded to your headquarters.

I am convinced that what I saw was not an aircraft of any type, nor was it a weather balloon, a reflection, or any other known object. I am positive it was a strange and unidentified flying object.

I would appreciate your acknowledgement of this report and any further information you can provide regarding this incident.

Sincerely,
(Signature)
