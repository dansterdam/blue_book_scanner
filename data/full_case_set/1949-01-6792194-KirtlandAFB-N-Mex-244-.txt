AT KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE1 UNCLASSIFIED

On 13 January 1949 Dr. --------- provided a letter from one
of his students at the University of New Mexico, relevant to
an observation of 5 December 1948. The information contained in this letter
is summarized below:

At about 2000 hours, 5 December 1948, while walking along the west
side of Varsity Village, a University housing area, --------- saw a bright
green "meteorite." The color was a brilliant green, as in a traffic signal,
or a neon tube. There was a definite tail to the object, i.e., it was not
merely a point of light. Venus was very hard to determine, but was esti-
mated on the third that the gu title that planet - was visible in the daytime.
He discounted any claim of noc as to the size, however, saying
that ----- could not definitely say. The object appeared in the western sky,
vertically about five degrees. There was mi definite corona or halo effect,
but no sparks or trail were produced. The sky was hazy and there was a
cloud cover at the time of the sighting, but ---- did not recall any
extent of the cloudiness. No stars were visible in the part of the sky where
the "meteor" was observed.

NOTE: No other report of observation for 5 December gives a time element of
20D2 hours. ----------- will be contacted by Dr. LaPaz in an effort to obtain
precise measurement of his observational angle.

2. The report of observation by Lance SARL WILLIS, A333, was provided
by Lt. Col. JOHN A. CAROLIN, Chief Inspector, A333, Los Alamos, New Mexico on
17 January 1948. This report provided the following data:

Date: 6 January 1949 Color: Brilliant green
Time: 0310 Elevation: 3 to 5 degrees
Direction: Azimuth 30 degrees Trajectory: Flat
Speed: Slower than a meteor Observation 101

The object was visible for about two seconds, low in the sky to the
northwest. It moved in a straight line at high speed. It looked like a
bright green incandescent light. No estimate of size could be made. Direction
of movement was east to west, flew on a level course, disappearing behind the
mountainous horizon to the west. (Inclosure 1)

3. On 7 January 1949 the Chiet, Physical Security Branch, Sandia Base,
New Mexico, (S/ATH/S.J. DOYLE), forwarded a report of observation by Pfc.
------------------- 5450th MP. Group.
that on 6 January 1949, while guarding an aircraft near the Ordnance Area,
Kirtland Air Force Base, he had observed a bright object travelling across
the sky. The time was approximately 1730, and the APO specified, providing
a clear blue background. The object was aimed shaped, about two feet long,
bright white in color, and moving at a high rate of speed. Altitude was
estimated at 1500 to 2000 feet; altitude traverse was estimated at 500
feet. There was no sound or trail. Two other persons with -------- did not
see the object. (Inclosure 2)

  4. Dr. L A E transmitted a report to the District Commander, 17th
District Office of Special Investigations, on 6 January 1949 relative to
certain unexplained sound phenomena observed at Los Alamos. Pertinent summary
of this report follows:

      Anomalous sounds were heard at four different Security Stations at
Los Alamos on the night of 30 December 1948. Three of these stations were
visited in company with the AFS3 Inspectors who had heard the sounds. At
Station 340 Inspectors_____, and _____ were questioned. _____
said that at approximately 2010, 30 December 1948 they heard a sound as
of a truck laboring up the hill. The sound was so definite that they went
out to inspect the truck, but could find no sound source_______ aside
from the fact that this was part of the foggy rainy spell. When on their way back
to Station 340, the sound recurred and they went on to ____ the source.
_______ found nothing but at 2020, the sound was gone and they checked the AEC
records. This spot this sound occurred gave a duration of eight and one-half
seconds and height was of no moment then made due to observation on the
aenograph and they discussed the matter for about a half-hour. Then a "bogy"
alarm was given over the communication net by Headquarters. _____ and _____
just before the alarm cam in and his place was taken by_____. The noise
was heard again at 2050 by _____ ______. This time 'twas definitely not an
aerial noise. Both men said that an airplane motor came close to being the
cause of sound, but insist there was no visible object the sound was
wholly similar to that of an aircraft. Timing of movement showed a probable
duration of 10 to 15 seconds for the aerial sounds. Azimuth and elevation
readings were take for each estimated position of the sound.

      At Station 360, Inspector _____, also interviewed relating to
the sounds he reported by him. He said that he had heard the sounds reported
at 2010, 2020, and 2050, but that about ten or fifteen minutes after the
"Bogy" warning, he heard the motor ___ ____ with his hand a sound like heavy wagon
on the roadway, and later a sound like the whistle no ____ made by some airplanes
in a flight. The time was between 2110 inclusive. Azimuth and elevation
readings were taken of the estimated position of the sound.

      Inspectors ____ and _____ were interrogated at
Station 350. According to _______, at approximately 2010 on 30 December he
heard a noise which he believed to be the motor of a 140 horsepower Cub air-
plane. The sound lasted about 5 minutes. At about 2020 he heard the same
noise again, this time for about two or three minutes. At about 2050 the same
noise was heard. The "Bogy" alarm was then sounded by headquarters, and
_______ believes that his reports of the sounds were responsible for the
alarm. _________ thought that he first noise sounded like a light tank coming
along the road. Azimuth and elevation readings were taken of the position,
as indicated by _____.

      Inspector _____ and ____ had been at Station 350 at 2010
was interrupted by telephone. ________ who told them was informed 1010
and saw a “craft” orbiting directly overhead, then moving off to ____ than
_____ an aircraft at very low altitude. Total time __ to _____ was
30 minutes.

Text from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED
In his summary of the above interviews Dr. LA PAZ finds that the
sounds were unlike normal aircraft sounds, that a Cub could not have operated
at the altitude needed to conform with the figures given by the transit read-
ings, that no heavy machinery or tanks had been operating and two other
Inspectors had heard similar sounds on the morning of 31 December at about
0540.

Calculations based on the transit readings indicate that the sound
originated at a point with coordinates 106 degrees 17 minutes, 35 degrees 52
minutes.

5. AACS at Kirtland Air Force base was checked by the writer and so far
as their records show no aircraft were near Los Alamos during the times of
the sound observations.

6. AACS at Walker Air Force Base was checked by Special Agent BIERMAN
H. CAIVITE, and reported that no aircraft were shown near Los Alamos by their
log during the critical times.

According to Inspector ------, he and the guards observed at Station 340 at 2010, 2020, and 2050; and at Station 300, but some 10 to 15 minutes after the boys at 340 report heard both the sound ------, heard what first sounded like the rumbling of heavy wagons on a roadway and what later sounded like the whistling noise made by some airplanes while in flight. The duration of the sound as determined by a stop-watch measurement of relay motions in going outside, returning to the communication tent, and again going outside, was 45 seconds. However, Inspector ------ reports this was heard the sound probably for a minute or more after he went outdoors the second time. According to Wyrss, the azimuth of the sound heard at 2100-2105 was 420 00' and the elevation 10° to 15°.

4. At Station 350 statements were obtained from ABSS Inspectors ------, ------, and ------. According to Inspector ------ the initial approxi-mately 2010 and December 30, he heard a noise in the air which he believed to be the motor noise of a 140 HP., Cub.

5. In addition to the men personally interviewed at Stations 340, 350, and
330, a telephone conversation was held with Inspector [redacted], who
had also heard the anomalous noises at Station 350. According to [redacted]
he first heard this noise (identified as the airplane motor of a Cub) at approx-
imately 3010, at which time the noise to him seemed to be almost directly over-
head at Station 350. The plans (noise) seemed to orbit his position for
approximately 2 minutes, and that the plane (noise) slowly receded toward the
northeast and continued to orbit at very low elevation in that direction for
approximately another 38 minutes.

6. On the basis of all the interviews held, the following summarizing
statements can be made:

    6.1. Each man interrogated was asked if at any other time during
    his experiences he had heard such noises as he heard on the night of
    December 30. Without exception, all answers were to this question were in the
    negative.

    6.2. Although six of the seven observers interrogated, in one way
    or another, associated the anomalous sounds with airplane noises, and
    questionings each man admitted that at certain respects the noise heard
    were unlike any planes noises he had ever heard. It was quite apparent that
    the men were attempting to describe very unusual sounds in terms of those
    aural noises with which, as former Air Force flyers, they were best
    acquainted.

    6.3. Since Weather Bureau reports indicate that the under surface of
    the overcast blanketing the Los Alamos area was at an elevation of approx-
    imately 13,000 feet, the identification of the noises observed with motorc-
    icles or of any type planes is obviously impossible. This impossibility
    had already occurred to all of the men interviewed, although they had
    estimated the under surface of the overcast to lie at a height of not more
    than 11,000-12,000 feet.

    6.4. The existence of the overcast not only suggests the possibility
    that the noises observed were really surface noises originating in the
    operation of heavy machinery and reflected from the overlying cloud layer
    in such fashion as to simulate sounds of aerial origin. Lt. Ohlson
    states that this possibility has been exhaustively investigated and is
    definitely ruled out. No heavy machines and none of the tanks stationed
    in the Los Alamos area were in operation during the interval when the
    noises were heard.

    6.5. Another possibility which occurred to nearly everyone who heard
    the noises was that: instead of originating in a low-flying Cub type plane,
    the sounds had their origin in a heavier aircraft plane flying above the
    overcast and presumably lost. This hypothesis is regarded as inacceptable
    for several reasons. In the first place, careful investigation has failed
    to reveal than any plane of the sort described was actually in flight over
    the Los Alamos area. In the second place, no radio distress signals or

Incident #242 --- Los Alamos, New Mexico --- 6 January 1949

The information offered concerning this incident is meager, and there was only one observer. Accordingly, to the description, a brilliant green incandescent light was seen low on the horizon for about two seconds; speed was "hi" but slower than that of a meteor. In view of this scanty evidence, no definite conclusion can be drawn.

If it were not for the fact that this incident appears to belong in the family of low-axis 7 green flashes," this object would be considered to have been a slow meteor, even though the time of night of this sighting does not favor that hypothesis. It is much more probable, however, that this incident falls into the pattern of those dealt with in detail in the report on Incident #2235. See that report for further discussion.

other attempts by the crew of another aircraft lost plane to make a
position location were observed. And Finally, two ASIS inspectors
(who had no knowledge of the anomalous sounds observed earlier on
the night of December 30) reported precisely the same sort of anom-
alous sounds as heard at Station 370 at 0540 on the early morning of
December 31. These sounds were heard for several minutes and were
reported to have receded slowly toward the southeast.

7. If we assume that Stations 340 and 350 observed the same sound
sources at 2010 and 2020, then these sources as found to project into
points lying near the paved highway which leads up the mountain side to
Station 340. On the basis of the elevation determinations made at Station
340, it is furthermore found that as a "first source" would be about 100 feet
lower in elevation than Station 350 and the second source approximately 1350
feet lower than this station. The second differences in elevation could again
seem to suggest that the sound sources may have been situated on or near the
paved highway. However, the very general observations made by our experi-
mental man, Lieutenant at Station 350, are entirely incompatible with
the assumption that the sounds as heard at 2020 was only some 1350 feet
lower than Station 350. Actually, more than observation shows that
this second source was at an elevation of or 2020 feet, not feet above the
horizontal plane through Station 350. This means there has been approxi-
mately 10,000 feet ABOVE, not below, Station 340. This, impossibly large
discrepancy shows that our initial assumption is untenable and it there-
fore seems impossible to establish a concordance between observations made
at Stations 340 and 350 PRIOR to the bogey warnings, i.e., during the times
when the observers at Station 340 heard the sound only from within their
observation post in contrast to the observers at Station 350, who made their
observations in the open air. The observers inside the house at
Station 340 actually heard sound emanating from a group located high
above them, in accordance with the conditions imposed by the oppressive
atmosphere, what they heard might well have been so distorted by the struc-
tural materials surrounding them and by their predisposition to assign all noises
to high-flying traffic sources that they would have been led to report such
elevations as were measured for them at Station 340 on January 5.

8. In sharp contrast to the discordances noted in the observations pre-
ceding the bogey warning at 2050, the open-air observations made at and
immediately following this warning show a quite satisfactory concordance.
In fact, if we assume that all three stations, 340, 350, and 390 were listen-
ing to the same sound source at 2050 and shortly thereafter, then the actual
elevation above sea level of this sound source as computed from the angular
observation observed at Stations 390 is 11,230 feet, at Station 350 is 12,213
feet and at Station 340 is 10,196 feet. The rise or that is, the

measurements were made, it is felt that such a discrepancy in the projections
is not surprising.

9. Unless some as yet undiscovered surface source of sound, which might
have produced by reflection from the overcast such apparently aerial noises
as were observed at Stations 340, 350, and 390 is uncovered, the facts set
forth above would seem to prove that on December 30 between the hours of 2000
and 2100 some sound producing source was in motion in or possibly beyond the
overcast above the Los Alamos area. Whether this could have been a conventional
airplane or not must be decided by those who have access to experience
and information not at the command of the undersigned.

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

1742-3 Jan. AET.: An object which appeared as a bright green incandescent
light was seen for a period of approximately two seconds low in the sky to
the northwest. at 0310 6 Jan 1949. The speed was slower than that of a 
meteor. It moved in a straight line at a high rate of speed. No surmise
could be made accurately as to its actual size or altitude. Direction of 
movement was East to West. Course appeared level without apparent angle of
descent. It disappeared behind the mountainous western horizon.

To: Lt. Colonel Doyle Rees, Commanding Officer
    District No. 7
    Office of Special Investigations

From: Lincoln LaPaz, Director
     Institute of Meteoritics

Subject: Report of Anomalous Sounds Observed by AESS personnel at Los Alamos
           on 1948, December 30

1. On 1949, January 5, Major C. L. Phillips, USAF, and the undersigned
under the guidance of Lt. Earl D. Highmower, AESS, visited three of the four
stations at which anomalous sounds were heard during the night of 1948,
December 30. In the present preliminary report, a summary of the pertinent
facts is given and, on the basis of azimuth and elevation readings taken at
the three stations where sounds were heard simultaneously, an approximate
determination is made of the location of the sound source in space.

2. At Station 340 statements were obtained from AESS Inspectors
and according to them both heard what they at first thought was a truck laboring up
the highway to blow their station. The sound was so definite that they arose
from their beds to go to the door to make the customary inspection, only to find the
roadway was empty. The sound terminated within a second or two after they open
ed the door and stopped outside. The next sound of their operations and observation
room, which was within a few yards upon what was occurring. The sound approximated
about 10 minutes later, at approximately 2020, the same incident occurred
Again, both men raising from their chairs, opening the door, and stepping
outside only to discover that the roadway was again empty. A stopwatch
determination for this case gave a duration for the count of 35 seconds.
This sound repetition of the unusual sound made a considerable impression
on the inspectors involved and the matter was under discussion during the
half hour that elapsed before a bogey alarm came in over communication at
approximately 2050. By this time, men had left Station 340 and the third
observation was made by and. According to these inspectors,
the noise heard at approximately 2050 was definitely an aerial noise in
contrast to the noises heard at 2010 and 2020. Neither man was willing to
identify the noise as ordinarily originating from an airplane, although both
agreed that the sound of a plane motor probably came closest to representing
what they heard. A slow whoosh terminating in a loud a diaphragm of 90-95 lbs
pressure for the aerial noise. Because the inspectors felt that their minds
were secure to determinations of compassing for the second and third incidents
run for the first, azimuth and elevation readings were taken only for the
occurrences at 2020 and 2050. Indications of position, therefore, are exact or present
as exact as 2020 was 40-37 and 79 elevation, 2020 location; 2050 location.

FROM:     Chief, Physical Security Branch

SUBJECT: Reported Observation of Unidentified Light or Flare Moving Across
                the Sky on 6 January 1949

1. On 7 January 1949, the writer interviewed Pfc. Meredith J.
Everitt, ASN 38552954, Headquarters, 450th AFB Group, concerning
the unidentified light or flare which he had reportedly seen moving
across the sky.

2.  Pfc. Everitt advised that on 6 January 1949 he was guarding
a C-97 airplane at the landing strip located adjacent to the
Ordnance area, when at approximately 1750 hours he noticed a bright
object travelling across the sky, from the Southeast towards the
Northwest. He related that the object was diamond shaped, approxi-
mately two feet long, and appeared to have a bright star in its center
than at the edges. The estimated that the object was approximately
1500 to 2000 feet in the air and travelled approximately 500 feet,
horizontal to the earth's surface, before he lost sight of it. Pfc.
Everitt was unable to estimate the speed of the object, but stated
that he has seen low flying jet planes, and that this object travelled
much faster than the jets that he has observed. There was no smoke
or other vaporous material visible to Pfc. Everitt around. or follow-
ing the object.

3. At the time Pfc, Everitt witnessed the object, he stated
that the sky was clear, furnishing a light blue background, and that
the object appeared to be a bright white light, with no other appar-
ent visable color.

4.  Standing guard with Pfc. Everitt were Sgt. Richard Woolsey
and Cpl. Wilson, and according to Pfc, Everitt, neither of the other
men saw the object. Everitt explained that he called to Sgt. Wooley-
sedge, who was standing at the other end of the plane, and told him
to look at the object in the sky, but by that time it had disappeared.

5. Pfc. Everitt stated that he attended Flight School, under the
G.I. Bill of Rights in Houston, Texas, during the year 1947, and that
he has had some experience in observing aircraft.
