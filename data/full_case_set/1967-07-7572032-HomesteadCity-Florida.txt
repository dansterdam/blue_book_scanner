GIRL STICKS TO 'SAUCER' STORY
By GERRY CROSBY

The article discusses a 15-year-old Florida girl who claimed to have seen a "flying saucer" in the vicinity of the Homestead Air Force Base on July 24. The article indicates that the girl continues to insist on her story, despite some skepticism from authorities.

Transcript of the text in the document:

"Sighter Story - The witness, Delila, stated that at about 10:00 P.M. on August 7, 1967, she was sitting on her porch at her home in Homestead, Florida, when she noticed a bright light in the sky. She said the light seemed to be hovering or remaining stationary. She immediately called her husband, Merle, to come and see it. Merle stated that when he came out, the object was still there and appeared to be a bright-white light, larger than a star, but smaller than the moon. It seemed to be about 8 to 10 feet in diameter.

The object remained in view for about 10 to 15 minutes, and then it started moving very rapidly to the east, and in a few seconds it disappeared from view. Delila and Merle both stated that the object made no sound and that it did not appear to have any discernible shape other than a bright-white light. According to the Pennsauken, N.J. report, the couple called the police and the sheriff's office, but no officers were available to come to the scene. Delila and Merle stated that they were both convinced that what they saw was some type of UFO."

South Dade's UFO Probed
By GERRY CROSBY
The recent increase in reported sightings of UFO's (unidentified flying objects) may possibly result in South Dade's own University of Colorado UFO investigation, being sponsored by a grant from the Air Force.
NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) has completed a study of the sightings in the South Dade area, carrying on a study of UFO reports made to the growing list of people who have spotted them, according to John B. Hoelscher, a psychologist that South Dade may hold the key to the nation's continuing UFO mystery.
Hoelsberry is closely scientific-minded. Members go into the field, try to prove or disprove who claim they have spotted UFOs, gather the data, and send the reports to Washington D.C. and the University of Colorado.
Hoelsberry visited the Perrine-Homestead area as a result of a "flying saucer" story published August 2 in the Miami Herald. He checked the reports of Everett-Harold Rubrooks, a Jewish Creek. NICAP was also interested in the South Dade sightings, as well as other South Dade persons mentioned in the story.
Hoelsberry's file on South Dade's residents, who have made UFO sightings, is quite impressive. From a ne wstandpoint, NICAP's stand, according to Hoelsberry, is that some of the sightings could not possibly be explained away as conventional aircraft or natural phenomena.
