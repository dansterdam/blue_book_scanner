When you saw these objects, exactly where geographically could you fix their position?
At about 2:50 AM over Bradley California. I observed them over the Naval Air Station, south shore of the Salton Sea. Three disappeared and two headed south.

What was your line of sight or vision, did you have to look high or at an angle?
At an angle.

Then you are not quite sure what they were?
They are correct, except that they had lights, traveling fast, and circling. They were circling quite tightly.

Did you ever see them at night?
No.

Interrogation of Desk Sergeant Imperial, California, at 1945 hours on 15 May 1952:

Will you please relate what you actually saw on the early morning of 13 May 52?
I was on duty as the desk sergeant at the City Police Department here in Imperial, California, when a call came in concerning an address. As I was coming down the street searching for an address, when I saw an odd glow coming down from the sky. I stopped the car and got out to take a look. I observed five objects circling. They would disappear and reappear and disappear again. This occurred for about 2 minutes. Then they headed off in a southwesterly direction over the Naval Air Station. They were very fast and high up.

Do you know a jet when you see one?
Yes, I'm quite definite.

What steps did you take? 
Immediately I called the Radar Station and reported to the Desk Sergeant who was on duty.

Have you heard of this or discussed this with anyone else?
Just police officers, and I read about it in the paper also.

How high would you estimate these objects were?
About a mile high.

What about the weather?
Clear.

Were they any US aircraft, airborne?
Not that I could tell. They were gone in a few minutes later.

Where were they from? 
I don't know.

COMMENT OF D/I:
It is quite possible that an aircraft of the USAF, a B-47, may have been observed, following or sighting the air target in various maneuvers. The close tight formation observed could have been an actual USAF air operation. However, the interrogation is designed to evidence that a definite weakness exists in the civil defense system and there is an immediate need for improved intelligence activities during peacetime when unidentified aircraft are sighted.

The text in the document is as follows:

APPENDIX V

EL CENTRO, CALIF. AREA - 13 May 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
In the El Centro, Calif., Area on 13 May 1952 four separate reports of unidentified objects were made as follows:

a. 1115Z - Hovering over El Centro, five "flying saucers" as large as B-36's, with a light underneath, disappeared at a terrific rate of speed. They were reported by the El Centro Sheriff's Office.

b. 1113Z - An FSFE pilot taking off from El Centro Naval Air Station reported what appeared to be a shooting star about 60 degrees to the east.

c. 1130Z - A sheriff's car at Holtville, Calif., sighted a strange object resembling a parachute and the bottom of the Salton Sea.

d. 1150Z - A control tower operator at Yuma, Arizona, sighted an orange and blue object 500 and 700 miles across hovering for a short time in one position. It changed to another position. Operator said it was sighted for two periods to be a falling star.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
There were no AF fighters at the time but four FSFE's from El Centro Naval Air Station were airborne from 1100Z to 1230Z.

III. CONCLUSIONS
a. It is possible that the FSFE's and what appeared to be a shooting star account for the first reports.

b. What appeared to be a shooting star was probably a meteor.

c. No conclusions.

d. The tower operator stated that he had observed the same phenomenon several times before and had been instructed that in reports of such phenomena the reflection of sunlight from aircraft at high altitudes might not be entirely the reflection of suncats.
