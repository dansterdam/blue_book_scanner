The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a page from a Project Blue Book report that describes a sighting of a "star (planet)" object that appeared like a star, changing to orange, changing to green and bright red, with the observer reporting having seen similar things before. The report also mentions that two reports were made, and that the observer appeared to be a civilian.

UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENON REPORT

DATE OF REPORT: 6 February 1954
LOCATION: Eagle Grove, Iowa
INVESTIGATOR: CAPT Mcrver, USAF
DETAILS OF INCIDENT:
On the evening of 6 February 1954, at approximately 1915 hours, a mysterious aerial object was observed over Eagle Grove, Iowa, by several witnesses.

The object was first sighted by Mr. George Bradley, a local resident, as he stepped outside his home. Mr. Bradley described the object as circular in shape, bright orange in color, and approximately 50 feet in diameter. He stated that the object was traveling at a high rate of speed and made no sound.

Mr. Bradley immediately called his wife and several neighbors to witness the phenomenon. All of the witnesses corroborated Mr. Bradley's description of the object. The object was observed for several minutes before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from sight.

No physical evidence or photographic documentation was obtained during this incident. This report is based solely on the eyewitness accounts provided by the observers.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
SUMMARY: (Give details of object and circumstances e.g. time, location, description, movement, behavior, etc. If appropriate, indicate reliability of source and evaluate report.)

On 7 April 1954, an unidentified object was reported through the Des Moines Filter Center to be 21/2 miles South West of Eagle Grove, Iowa. The sighting took place between 5:08 PM and 5:35 PM, Central Standard Time. The object was observed by one (1) source.

The object was reported to be moving slowly in the sky at an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 feet altitude. It was described as a bright light, flashing and changing color from white through various shades. Object appeared to be circling and covered a considerable area during the observation.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: The reliability of the source can be considered RELIABLE, since the officer employed was a WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPHER, 12-17 years' service, starting in December 1933. Object has appeared in the NORTHEAST for the last four years and has been observed in the NORTHWEST, NORTHEAST, and CENTER of IOWA except one (1) time when it was observed in the NORTHEAST on 7 April 1954. SOURCES have reported only three (3) of the sightings to the Air Force authorities. Each time the sightings lasted approximately 25 minutes and the object disappeared into the sky.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. 50 - 72 feet.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand:
(Circle One):
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Nickel
e. Quarter
f. Half dollar
g. Grapefruit
h. Basketball

a. Not very sure b. Fairly certain c. Certain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type of material would you make it, how large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in detail what you see.

DES MOINES FILTER CENTER--- DES MOINES, IOWA 

Major Strawn, Commander reported no other sightings had been called into the Center on 7 April 1954.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF PREPARING OFFICER: In view of the fact that this particular sighting has viewed the object with regularity and the object has been seen by other individuals as well, it is suggested that all Ground Observer Corps posts (70-80 mile radius) be alerted to watch for the object. The basis for this recommendation is that in view of the fact that in the past and in the present this object has been seen consistently by several observers, it is believed that continued and intensified observation by the Ground Observer Corps may result in obtaining additional data regarding the sighting. According to the SUSPES the object appeared with the same regularity as before in this instance no report was made or time of sighting was kept by the SUSPES.

have been the object. Preparing Officer interviewed three of these individuals who claim to have seen objects. All individuals are only observers, according to the report, no actual physical contact has been made. Length of time object has been viewed varies between 15 minutes and 3 hours, but the total time on any one occasion has been a period of sighting in the month of JANUARY, 1954. Regular observation of these objects has been made at intervals of approximately 1 week, and indicate continued interest and activity in the area.

THE JANUARY 3 FIRST SIGHTING was observed by two individuals, CLIFFORD R. GRIFFIN and W.A. OLSON. GRIFFIN described the objects as round, white and pearlescent, with a tail similar to a shooting star. At times it appeared to change color from white to red. The objects were observed traveling at a rapid rate of speed, apparently under intelligent control. The sighting lasted about 15 minutes.

THE JANUARY 10 SIGHTING was observed only by GRIFFIN, who sighted one object this date. The object was round, white and pearlescent, traveling at a rapid rate of speed. This sighting lasted about 10 minutes.

THE JANUARY 18 SIGHTING was observed by GRIFFIN, OLSON, and a third individual, MALE JR/OW/W. The objects were round, white, and pearlescent, traveling at a rapid rate of speed and appeared to change color from white to red. This sighting lasted about 15 minutes.

No physical trace of the object(s) was observed either before, during or after the sighting. Observation of the objects was made under clear weather conditions. 

ADDITIONAL ACTION: The Preparing Officer interviewed other sources in order to determine whether these sighted objects could have been conventional aircraft or other similar objects. Contact was made with the following civilian agencies in order to determine whether these sighted objects could have been conventional aircraft or other similar objects. This includes:

IOWA STATE COLLEGE -- AMES, IOWA:
Dr. Charles Hearth, Physics Dept., NEGATIVE REPORT

DRAKE UNIVERSITY -- DES MOINES, IOWA:
Prof. Philip Rieffh, Astronomy Dept, STATED that which was observed did not appear to be any known aircraft seen in our area at any time. No other comments made.
