The image provided appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. There is no photograph or image present on this particular page. The text on the page appears to describe a UFO sighting that occurred in Buenos Aires, Argentina on July 18, 1965. The report provides details about the sighting, including the appearance of the UFO, the reactions of witnesses, and media coverage of the event. The text also mentions that the object was tracked by local authorities, and that the sighting was reported to Project Blue Book, the official U.S. Air Force program for investigating UFO reports.

Here is the text from the document:

The Buenos Aires Sighting

On the night of July 18, 1965, several persons were watching various lights in the sky over the city of Buenos Aires. According to the news item, camerasmen of two newspapers snapped a photo of an object in the night sky which later developed into a round luminous object. As the first object disappeared, a second object appeared on the photograph. The included object showed as a point of light. In the second photograph the second object appeared larger and brighter. The witnesses reported that the objects moved very rapidly back and forth in the sky.

The object was apparently seen by many people, radio and television switch boards were jammed for quite some time with calls reporting the object's presence. Newspaper clippings showing the object reported by APROFE were clues which showed various points of light which apparently are stars and the "typical line" of light which could be described as a pulsating glowing medicine capsule. The glowing object also fits the general description of the object seen over the Buenos Aires Weather Bureau on the 11th.

FLYING SAUCER REVIEW

16 Jul 65
Argentina

Buenos Aires and Rosario
Typical of the many sightings of UFOs over the 
cities of Buenos Aires and Rosario, are two reports
that people saw UFOs over the area on July 16 and
thereafter, which drew widespread interest.
In Buenos Aires, at 8:40 p.m., a disc-shaped
object was seen stationary, and a cupola was
visible at its top. The object remained there
for about fifteen minutes, then moved away at
high speed. 
In Rosario, at the same time, a similar 
object was seen and remained visible for some
fifteen minutes before vanishing southwards. Just
before 7 p.m., channel 13 of the local TV service
was blacked out for two minutes. During the 
transmission, radio interference occurred. Simultaneously,
a powerful light was flashed from the object in the sky.

The object was described as being over Buenos Aires 
on UFO-busy nights.

I NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT OUT OF MY WINDOW THAT WAS MOVING AWFULLY FAST. IT WAS ABOUT 6:45 AM AND I HAD JUST FINISHING GETTING DRESSED FOR WORK. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A PLANE, BUT AS I WATCHED IT I REALIZED THAT IT WAS NOT MAKING ANY NOISE AND ITS SPEED WAS FAR GREATER THAN ANY PLANE I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT SEEMED TO ACCELERATE AND THEN MAKE A SHARP TURN. THE SHAPE SIZE AND MOVEMENTS WERE UNLIKE ANYTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE. HE SAID, "SURE IT IS. I SAID, "NO IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE A UFO!" AND HE SAID, "LOOKS LIKE YOUR BOSS IS GOING TO BEAT YOU TO WORK TODAY!" WE BOTH WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 5 MIN. AND THEN IT SEEMED TO GO BEHIND SOME CLOUDS.

UAO On Argentine Border River
On 10 July 1963, within hours of the spotting of the object over Buenos Aires, a group of six people who were swimming on a beach near Colonia, Uruguay, saw a cigar-shaped object over the Rio Plata. The Rio Plata is a 35-mile wide river that separates Argentina and Uruguay.

One of the six observers was Jose Alarcon, 17, of Colonia. He and his companions reported the object to police and said it was cigar-shaped, reddish in color and about 10 meters (33 feet) long. It moved above the river and not far from the beach. Larrauma said it moved upward when he focused it and bent at a slight angle, similar to a jet trail. The other five people, two of whom were adults, confirmed Larrauma's report and description of the object.

SUBJECT: Report, Vol. 12, No. 4
DATE: Aug '65

SAUCER LANDING IN URUGUAY: On July 12th, a group of six teenagers in Colonia, Uruguay, saw a flying saucer land for two minutes in the sand near the shore of the Rio de la Plata. They called some adults, who arrived in time to see the UFO, which was by that time hovering about fifteen feet above the land. There it remained for several minutes before taking off toward the horizon at an altitude of 500 yards. All the witnesses agreed that the object was shaped like a disc and was about 25 feet in diameter. The UFO made a humming sound and left an imprint in the sand in the form of the latter 'X', which made many people believe it was a genuine incident. This made news in many people and was photographed by a special correspondent of a Buenos Aires newspaper. The light on the object was so bright as to be blinding, said the young teenagers. They tried to approach it and touch it, while it was on the ground, but were prevented by the intense light. Pedro Inchausti Gares, one of the adult witnesses, confirmed that the UFO was hovering very near the surface of the ground, where he saw it, but was also great in distance from him in its ability to elevate. When the officer reached the location where he told his story simply and with apparent sincerity.

STRANGE OBJECTS IN SKY
Mystery Flying
Objects Reported

BUENOS AIRES (UPI) - An early type of unidentified flying objects were sighted in the sky over the River Plate here and again in neighboring Uruguay, an Argentine navy spokesman said today.

The observations were in line with a number of similar sightings over the past week in various parts of South America.

The Argentine navy spokesman said the objects were observed last night and early this morning "coming and going from various directions across the river." He said they were described as bright, cigar-shaped objects which seemed to have a small, reddish tail.

The objects were observed from both the Argentine and Uruguayan sides of the River Plate, he stated. They were reported to be traveling at "tremendous speed" at an estimated height of 3,000 feet. The deputy commander of the Argentine navy's Rio de la Plata command said the observations were being investigated.

FLYING SAUCERS

(...) reported yesterday over the River Plate, Argentina and Uruguay.

CHILEAN REPORT, TOO 
Argentines See Queer
Flying Objects in Sky

BUENOS AIRES (UPI) - A number of unidentified flying objects have now been observed in the skies over Buenos Aires and elsewhere in Argentina, and also in Chile, it was reported here today.

The latest sightings, according to accounts reaching here, occurred over the last few days. 

The objects were described as flying at high speed and apparently controlled, and sometimes appearing as a heavy dazzling light.

Officials said that the observations were being carefully studied to try to determine the nature and origin of the flying objects. However, it was admitted that no satisfactory explanation had yet been found.

One unconfirmed report said that the objects were observed to change direction suddenly and with great speed, an action which caused difficulty in tracking them with instruments.

Scientific circles here appeared to be puzzled by the numerous reports of similar unidentified flying objects coming in from various parts of the country as well as from Chile.

The sightings, they stated, seemed to be increasing, though they continued to lack a satisfactory explanation. (...) similar to that of a jet airplane, but much faster.

STRANGE OBJECTS IN SKY / Mystery Flying Objects Reported

BUENOS AIRES (UPI) - An array of strange flying objects have been reported over the flat pampas of Argentina and Uruguay this month.

CHILEAN REPORT, TOO
Argentines See Queer Flying Objects in Sky

BUENOS AIRES, AP - A number of Argentines, who are not known for being excitable, have reported seeing strange objects in the sky in recent weeks and some Uruguayans have had similar experiences, according to Francis B. Kent, a United Press International correspondent in Buenos Aires.

"These things turn up suddenly in the sky, hover for a minute or two and then disappear suddenly," Kent reported. "They seem to be structured craft rather than ordinary aircraft."

The report said the strange objects were seen by members of the crew of a transport plane and truck drivers as well as by residents of rural areas. One truck driver said he and two companions watched one of the objects for 10 minutes before it disappeared.

Kent said the objects did not resemble conventional aircraft or satellites and some observers doubted they were caused by any known natural phenomenon.

He said reports of similar phenomena have come from various parts of South America in the last few months. In neighboring Chile there have been reports of unidentified flying objects, according to Kent.

ARGENTINE NAVY
DISCLOSES IMPORTANT
UFO CASE

An official Argentine Navy UFO report, labeled one of the most important Argentine UFO cases, contains information in connection with a mysterious event that occurred near the Rio Gallegos, Argentina region on December 15, 1962, according to the report.

During the night of December 15, 1962, says the official report, a large UFO (unidentified) was sighted from the deck of the vessel. The huge UFO was round-shaped, and it was moving at great speed. It displayed no lights, and made no sound. As it approached, the needles of the ship's magnetic compasses "suddenly and simultaneously" swung off course, pointing toward the UFO.  The power which caused this disturbance was so strong, the report states, that the UFO was 2,000 meters (well over 1 mile) away from the ship. 

The transport commander radioed the Commander-in-Chief of the Argentine Navy. The Base Commander was so concerned that he accompanied the Hydrographic Service instrument experts to the scene. They found no electric or magnetic effects other than those caused by the presence of the UFO.

No magnetic instruments survived the disturbance, which experts determined was strong enough to affect the operation of the ship's engines, as well as equipment on board submarines and military and civilian aircraft, leaving the UFO undeterred.  

According to C.R. Dicani, whom the Secretary of the Argentine Navy appointed to investigate, several reports on the incident have been forwarded to NICAP.

Performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document:

THE flying saucer-shaped object climbed rapidly to an altitude of about 30,000 feet, moved over widely separated parts of the ground in a matter of seconds, then hovered motionless for several minutes before speeding out of sight, reports Walter Webb, of the Charles Hayden Planetarium.

This followed sightings of white objects in the last two years by American Airlines crews and others near Ardmore, Okla. Planes took photographs of one object and revealed that it was 300 to 400 feet in diameter and at a height of about 40,000 feet.

Mr. Webb said the latest sighting was by several civil defense observers and sheriff's deputies at Ardmore last Tuesday evening. 

The observers, he said, watched the saucer-shaped object for about 20 minutes as it performed various maneuvers high in the sky. Allen Hynek, scientific consultant to the Air Force, verified the report.

TALK WITH MEN WHO SAW THAT THING

THAT'S WHERE IT APPEARED

from GRAHAM GAMBLE
CANBERRA, Saturday.- The "Cosa of the thing" this week has been a great flying-saucer mystery. Everyone 1 spoke to here said they were certain that flying saucers don't exist, but they would not easily be persuaded that "the thing' was merely some figment of the imagination.

The brilliant ball of light which shot across the Canberra horizon outside the city, and which was also seen in other parts of the eastern States, has left the scientific world of Australia puzzled and perplexed.

The "thing" appeared about 7.45 p.m. on Thursday and was observed in our own Commonwealth Observatory and other observatories throughout Australia. The Director-General of the Commonwealth Observatory, Dr. R. V. Dodson, and other scientists here, are still arguing about it and they have no real explanation for what they saw.

That is the situation in Australia today.

STILL A MYSTERY

As is pointed out in the Press, the "thing" appeared to be going at an incredibly high rate of speed, much faster than any known aircraft in existence. It seemed to be travelling on a level trajectory and was followed by a tail of light which was not like any normal trail of a meteorite.

The "thing" was seen in other parts of the continent and a great deal of speculation has arisen as to what it could have been. Scientists have not yet ruled out the possibility that it may have been a meteorite of some kind, but some of them are loath to make a definite pronouncement on it.

"STEEL DISC" 
Mr. Lindsay Teall, of Narrabundah, in Canberra, claims that he observed the object through binoculars. He says that what he saw was not a meteor or a shooting star, but a large, bright, steel-coloured disc which glowed brilliantly as it shot across the sky.

Mr. Teall said that the object was visible for about 45 seconds and was travelling at terrific speed.

Here, I think, is evidence which suggests that whatever the "thing" was it was certainly not a meteor or any normal celestial phenomenon. Meteors do not normally have the appearance of a steel-coloured disc which glows brilliantly. Neither do they have the apparent speed and trajectory which this object seemed to have.

"STEEL DISC"  

So the "thing" remains a mystery, and the scientific world here is still discussing and arguing about what it could have been.

The image contains a photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO) reportedly photographed over Buenos Aires, Argentina. The text below the photograph describes the incident, stating that the UFO was observed by members of the staff at the Santa Maria Airport in the Argentine capital on Friday. The object was described as a white, disc-shaped object that hovered over the city for 10 minutes before disappearing. The text also mentions that the Argentine government observatory had no record of any atmospheric disturbances at the time.

Text from the document:

1. An unidentified flying object reported on June 13, 1962 over the Antarctica.

UFO'S PHOTOGRAPHED OVER BUENOS AIRES

BUENOS AIRES (UPI) - An unidentified flying object was photographed over the Rio Plata, the 35-mile wide river that divides Argentina and Uruguay, spotted by several individuals on Friday. The object, which was described as disc-shaped and white in color, hovered over the Argentine capital situated across the river from Montevideo, for 10 minutes before disappearing. Members of the staff at the Santa Maria Airport in the Argentine capital observed the object on Friday as they reported sighting to the airport manager. Airport authorities said the object was observed for 10 minutes while the individual white object was videotaped to observe the objects. However, no success was reported. Several persons reported spotting unidentified flying objects over Buenos Aires shortly after sunset Friday, they described the objects, some of which were photographed, as clear-shaped and emitting red and green lights, careening from high speeds to hover.

During the period that the flying objects were seen over Buenos Aires, the broadcasting of one of the city's television stations was interrupted because of atmospheric interference.

The government observatory of San Miguel, Argentina, reported, however, that it had not recorded any atmospheric disturbances at the time.

Report head - 20 July 1965
At 2040 hours on 19 July 1965, a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, citizen reported seeing a large, orange-colored object hovering in the sky in the vicinity of the Monongahela River. The witness stated that the object appeared to be approximately 200-300 feet long and emitted a bright orange glow. The object reportedly hovered for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from sight.
The Air Force investigator interviewed the witness and collected additional details. The witness appeared to be a credible observer with no evidence of fabrication or hoax. No other reports were received from the area at the time of the incident.
Based on the information collected, the Air Force has classified this incident as "UNIDENTIFIED".

- page 34 -

The image contains two photographs that appear to be related to a UFO sighting report. The first photograph shows an object described as a "glowing object" in the sky. The second photograph shows a close-up view of what appears to be the same or a similar object.

The text in the document states:

From the Antarctic camp came a report that an unidentified flying object, maneuvered at terrific speed over Wilhelmina Bay near the scientific base.
Camere man James Barretts, confirmed that several persons had observed the strange object.
The object, viewed at amazing speed, maneuvered suddenly and was gone in a matter of seconds.
The object itself was very difficult to distinguish in detail, but was observed to be round in shape and to emit a brilliant glow. It was watched for several minutes, then disappeared as swiftly as it came.
He also reported that the object had caused electrical interference with radio communications and with the equipment of an automatic weather station in the vicinity.
Then came a report from Otis where a "flying man" said he saw the thing.
"It was a glowing object, larger than a star and the size of a half dollar held at arm's length. It came in from the west, descended about 1,000 feet and hovered in the sky over the town for about three minutes and then was gone in a flash."
Finally, the very day that Mariners was observing most intensely, a "curious glowing object" was reported over the Mariners control tower, said to be under radar observation for several minutes.

The image contains a newspaper article with two columns. The left column has the title "Flying Saucer on Sydney Beach - Man's Ceerie Story" and appears to describe an unidentified flying object sighting. The right column has the title "THE THING ON THE BEACH" and includes a sketch or illustration of a UFO, as well as a detailed description of the sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

FLYING SAUCER ON SYDNEY BEACH
Man's Ceerie Story

THREE times a busineesman saw a strange object last night on Vaucluse beach. He said it hovered Ove Blank
for 10 minutes before it took off, and vanished in clouds over Manly.

CLOSE-UP: GLAMPSES
The busineesman, who did not wish to be named, said he saw the object hovering over the beach for about 10 minutes.

"As it took off, it sent a blinding light of blue-green color all over the beach, and the light was dazzling to look at. It then climbed straight up Towards the clouds over Manly at a terrific speed. It didn't make any sound at all. The whole thing lasted about 10 minutes."

Dogs barked

Two dogs, a Labrador retriever and a smaller dog, barked continually when the object was over the beach. 

Three less

Earlier, the same busineesman claims he saw a similar object three times over the same beach. "This is the fourth time I have seen this object over the beach," he added.

"On the other three occasions it was seen quite late at night - around 9 or 10 o'clock. It would just come in over the headland, hover for a minute or two, and then disappear."

THE THING ON THE BEACH
Queer Glowing Object Near Vaucluse Stuns Onlooker

According to Mr. Denis Crane, of the Shell Co., who was first on the scene, an unidentified glowing object that rose from a Vaucluse beach last night has taken on a "local interest not seen before, even in the flying saucer field."

Mr. Crane explained: "I was within 50 yards of the object when it rose from the beach. It appeared to be about 18ft in diameter, circular, and glowed with a blue-green light. As it rose, it seemed to be under intelligent control."

Near disc or saucer

Mr. Crane said the object's flight was horizontal, not at an angle. 
"It rose slowly, about 50ft from where I was standing. I watched it for nearly a minute as it gained height, and then it suddenly, without any acceleration or time lag, just took off at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight."

Mr. Crane said the object was near disc or saucer-shaped, and appeared to have a slight dome. He said it was between 50 and 60ft in diameter.

The object was first sighted by a passer-by, Mr. Leslie Murray, who was walking on the beach. "I first noticed a bright, pulsating light on the sand," Mr. Murray said. "As I approached it, the light rose vertically and then took off at a speed which I can only describe as incredible."

SAUCER LANDING IN AUSTRALIA: On July 12th, a man named Denis Crowe made an unusually detailed sighting of a UFO which took off from a beach in Vaucluse, Australia. - The object - a giant disc - was observed in an erratic glow when he came upon it while walking his dogs at about 5:30 a.m. Although the object took off without a sound, the glow was detectable up to several miles away. The object's height was 9 feet, including what appeared to be its protruding from the bottom. The craft displayed a greenish-gray color. There was a hollow in the top that could have been a dome. 
This claim comes from the landing of the dogs. However, when the object took off a few seconds later, a yellowish glow appeared beneath it, and a whistling sound - which Crowe could not attach to any conventional aircraft - was heard. After the reaction of Manly. Strangely enough, as soon as the object was in the air, the dogs suddenly stopped barking.
From various parts of Australia during late July and early August, at least one photograph was taken.

PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SAY THEY ARE SEEING MORE IN SUMMER SKIES THAN BUZZING INSECTS AND BIRDS. ON 12 JULY 1965 A REPORT CAME TO WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE INDICATING UNUSUAL FLYING OBJECTS IN THE AIR SPACE AROUND CAPE COD AREA, MASSACHUSETTS.

DETAILS INDICATE THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE REPORTED SEEING TWO UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS THAT REMAINED IN THE SKY AND CAUSED A COMMOTION FROM OHIO TO MASSACHUSETTS.

AIR FORCE SAID ONLY 957 REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED, AND MOST SIGHTINGS REMAIN UNEXPLAINED. HOWEVER, A MORE INFORMATION BLUEBOXAT WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE IN DAYTON, OHIO, IS DESIGNED TO OBTAIN ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE INFORMATION REGARDING THIS SUBJECT.

COMMITTEE FOR AERIAL PHENOMENA IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

BASED ON THE CONCLUSION OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS, AND SCIENTISTS EVALUATIONS, IT IS THAT THESE UNUSUAL FLYING OBSERVATIONS MUST BE PROVEN SOME STRANGE OR INTELLIGENT ORIGIN, BECAUSE THEY DEFY ALL EXPLANATIONS UNDER OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE.

THOSE REPORTS ARE FROM PEOPLE WHO CONTINUE TO INSIST ON EXPLAINING THE SIGHTINGS AWAY IN EUROPE, JULY 7, HER HUSBAND AND WIFE SAID THEY OBSERVED TWO LUMINOUS OBJECTS NEAR THE SOUTHERN SIDE NEAR VALENSOLE, FRANCE.

MAURICE MASSE, A FARMER, REPORTED THAT ONE OF THE OBJECTS DISAPPEARED AND THE OTHER LANDED IN A FIELD WITH A LARGE PROJECTED BEAM OF LIGHT. THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED WITH CHANGING SCIENTIFIC FOLLOWUPS.

GENE-TAC VILLA DO PORTO, WEATHER STATION IN THE AZORES, SAID A GLOWING OBJECT APPEARED ON JULY 13 NEAR HIS OBSERVATION POST.

AROUND THE CLOSE ON JULY 13, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OFFICERS, AND VARIOUS PEOPLE OBSERVED STRANGE LIGHTS AND UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WAS VISIBLE FOR MOMENT THAN DIS APPEARED.

ANOTHER SIGHTING WAS REPORTED LAST NIGHT AT WEYMOUTH, MASS. A BALL OF FIRE PASSED OVER THE AREA 9:27 PM AND SOUNDED LIKE A FLYING SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE.

THIS PICTURE is one of several taken last July during a fantastic saucer sighting in South Argentina. The picture was taken by a news photographer in Bahia Blanca, Argentina, named Jose Palma, who was called out at 8:30 p.m. on the night of July 15th to interview a group of people who had just seen a UFO. In the course of a somewhat frantic viewing interview and photography, this photograph was made. Dozens of other saucer reports in July and August came from Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Honduras, Ecuador, Paraguay, Brazil, Venezuela, Chile, and many scattered parts of Argentina.

SAUCER LANDING IN ARGENTINA: On the night of July 13th, several people in a small town of Bahia Blanca, Argentina, saw a strange operation of a "saucer" ship landing near their homes. A picture was taken, just a few days earlier. In the landing incident, which is not described in detail to the article, the UFO gave out a blinding red light for several minutes as it moved about in the sky. Then, smaller objects came out of the larger one, and headed toward earth. After five minutes or so on the ground, the "scout ship" took off again and disappeared in the distance. It left behind scorched earth where it had landed, and traces of a physical evidence, which was taken away by local authorities to be analyzed.

UFO SIGHTING SUMMARY SHEET
UFO REPORT - 7/15/65

WITNESS: __ ________ , Watertown, Massachusetts

AGE: 22
OCCUPATION: Marine Stewardess Training School, Watertown, Massachusetts

PLACE: Watertown, Massachusetts (Residential Section)

DATE: 19 July 1965 TIME: 4:20 AM EDT

CASE BACKGROUND: On July 21, 1965, the witness reported that on July 19, 1965, between 4:15 AM and 4:20 AM EDT, she observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over Watertown, Massachusetts. The witness stated that she was the only person allowed to enter the plane, which was a regularly scheduled U.S. Marine flight. As she was about to enter the plane, she observed the object which she described as a "round shaped object with a bright blue and white light around the outside." The object was hovering and made no sound. It remained stationary for about 5 minutes and then accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared. The witness was quite upset about the incident.

DETAILS: The witness was lying in bed when she was awakened by a bright light shining through the second-story window. She got up and looked out the window and saw the object hovering over a nearby residential area. The object was round in shape with a bright blue and white light around the outside. There was no sound emitted from the object. The witness observed the object for approximately 5 minutes, during which time it remained stationary. The object then accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view in about 2 seconds. The witness stated that the object looked like a metallic or aluminum surface and there appeared to be no protrusions or openings. She indicated that the object was between 75 and 100 feet in diameter. The witness was quite disturbed by the incident and reported it to the authorities.

FACTS: Two UFO Reports/Observations, Mass. 7/25/65 - S. Hadleytown)
Outdoor conditions were generally clear and warm. There was a slight wind from the south-southwest. The object was first seen at approximately 8:30 PM and was visible for around 10 minutes.

EVALUATION:
- had never seen a UFO before - claims the object was metallic and bright. It was observed near a tree-line and seemed near the ground at first, then rapidly climbed and moved off to the west. The object did not emit any light or sound.
- is a reliable witness. She did not read literature on UFOs. She is not the type who looks for UFOs, but this sighting startled her greatly. This was her first and only UFO experience.

MOON: - The moon (first quarter) was lightly in the western sky, and provided limited illumination in the general area of the sighting.

STARS: - were and bright, and the brighter stars in the western sky were visible. This aided in the visual evaluation of the object.

BALLOON: NEGATIVE: The object moved much faster than a balloon, and its rapid ascent and departure was not characteristic of a balloon.

Speed: Rapid, the object first appeared close to the ground, then rapidly climbed and moved off to the west at a high rate of speed.

Direction: The object first appeared near a tree-line and moved off to the west at a high rate of speed.

Size: Small - about the apparent size of a star when first sighted, but seemed to get larger as it climbed.

Infrared: The object moved soundlessly and gave off no glow or exhaust, which indicates it was not an aircraft or conventional craft.

Possible but HIGHLY improbable: The object with an apparent metallic luster and rapid motion could have been some form of highly unconventional aircraft or device, but this is considered most unlikely given the lack of distinguishing features and the rapidity of the sighting.

I telephoned the Air Force Coordinator for UFO sightings in Boston and reported the details of this sighting. The Air Force officer stated that my report would be made part of the official Air Force files on UFOs.

FLYING SAUCER REVIEW
Jan-Feb 65

Deltavalent and Disaster 
The sky was clear and bright at about 9 p.m. on 
future (date salute to unnameation), when certain 
phenomena were observed in Northern Chile. An 
Airaamarin northern Chilean saw a pale blue-green, 
elongated object in the sky, which, glowing, suddenly 
appeared and finally as an elongated tube. When first 
seen, its colour was predominantly pale blue, but 
gradually the colour changed to a vivid green, with an orange-
coloured section at one end. The light then grew even 
brighter and finally vanished altogether.
Towards an area distant that then about 20 
kilometres up and down, the flight of Chile was
witnessed by numerous people, but they could not 
calculate its exact speed. The object seemed to be 
homeless and the Government declared a state of 
emergency, such as is customary in the cases of 
natural disasters where material damage has to be 
repaired and aid provided for the afflicted, and there was 
much commotion with the full-strength forces on the 
alert.
We feel nothing but sympathy for the unhappy
victims of this strange, unexplaile. mid-air sighting 
of a strange object and it is not surprising that 
such a commotion should be aroused at 12 by the
unusual spectacle. However, in this connection, 
I would refer readers to a rather peculiar article about the 
"Caer ny t Gath", in the July-September 1964 issue of
FSR (Vol. 10, No. 3), as quoted in the El Mercurio of
Santiago, Chile. It appears that the same kind of 
extraordinary and terrifying "celestial accident" occurred in
Wales in 1955, when the area of that particular 
object was estimated at being in the region of a 
square mile.
Our present reports indicate that the Antofagasta, 
Argentina incident caused severe panic, similar in kind, and from the 
description of the light and colour changes, the shape of the object-and the 
car troubles which culminated in the vast explosion- it would seem that this
was a phenomenon akin to what is currently to be
described as "V.F.C." (Vertical Flying Cylinder), with 
intense colour changes, heat so great that it could 
have caused a sudden upward surge, or explosion 
fully of winds to fill the violently-created depression. 
It is possible that there has been men which continue the
rather too hastily-held doctrine of the
for who would stand to watch an object in the sky
which might by the full destructive force of an 
atomic bomb?

The image does not contain a photograph. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document describing a reported sighting of a UFO or "saucer" in Chanaral, Chile on July 20, 1965. The text provides details of the incident, including the witness's description of the object and its reported characteristics.

Text from the document:

"SAUCER LANDING IN CHILE: On the night of July 29th, a civil engineer named Carlos Videla Lira saw a UFO which landed for a period of about 4-5 minutes. It was no more than 150 yards from the hotel where he was staying overnight. In the post city of Chanaral, Chile. It was a luminous object, metallic in appearance, and shaped like a top, which landed for a period of four or five minutes. The object gave off a strange light which produced no shadows. It had a diameter of 10-12 yards, and stood about 8 feet high. It illuminated the surrounding area about 30 yards above the sand, and then disappeared briefly at an altitude of about 30 yards above the sand, and then descended again to the same altitude. Several newspapermen based in Chanaral said they investigated this most interesting sighting, which was recounted in detail in a Buenos Aires newspaper.

The same newspaper tells of several less spectacular sightings on the night of July 29th. In Chanaral, numerous people saw a red and green object fly at low altitude over the city. A few nights earlier, a motor photographer had noticed a strange object which performed curves and turns which his movie camera was able to record for several minutes. The image was so faint that it can barely be seen only when the film is examined carefully frame by frame."

The objects were observed by three different groups of residents, who reported their sightings to Station WXOX. The objects were said to be traveling from south to north, descended to the base, and then "danced from side to side" before continuing their flight to the north.

On the 29th, a strange, round-shaped object was observed by many people in the afternoon. The object was estimated to be at about 15,000 feet altitude. The object took off with a trail of multicolored lights and after hovering over the city for a few seconds, it sped off, leaving a trail resembling a comet's tail, which remained in the sky for about a half hour after the sighting.

SUBJECT: UFO Report - 15 July 1965 (Westmont, Massachusetts)
DATE: 29 August 1965
FROM: Raymond D. Fowler - 237 Howard St., Framingham, Massachusetts 01701
TO: NICAP

The following report is providing information concerning the sighting of a UFO at Westmont, Massachusetts on 15 July 1965 between 10:30 PM and 2:00 AM EDT. The observers were a resident of Westmont and a licensed civilian pilot.

This phenomenon is still in the process of evaluation, over 40 UFO reports received from early to late hours of sighting. Several have been eliminated as hoaxes, a high-flying aircraft, the moon, satellites and misidentification of an aircraft. Because of the volume of reports being received, detailed accounts and our evaluation will be slow in reaching NICAP. The continuing "study" is actually reading an interpretation.

U.S. COAST 
INFORMATION ONLY 
July 23, 1965

Mrs. D A P
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mrs. P:

This is in response to your request for information on the UFO which you saw on the above date in the Washington, D.C. area. I regret that I was unable to supply this information to you sooner, but I have been in the field in connection with another siting in this area.

The siting you reported, which occurred at approximately 9:15 p.m. on the above date in the Washington, D.C. area, has been investigated and the pertinent details are as follows:

The object was described as a bright light in the sky which appeared to be moving in a northerly direction at a moderate rate of speed. The duration of the sighting was approximately 5 minutes. No sound was heard and no other unusual phenomenon was reported.

Investigation has failed to identify this object as any known conventional aircraft or other identifiable source. The Air Force is continuing its investigation of this incident.

I trust this information is helpful. If you have any additional details which you feel may be pertinent, please do not hesitate to provide them.

Sincerely,
[signature]

The object passed over my automobile
The terrific speed of the object was
remarkable. The object as it passed
over my automobile went in a straight
line and made no sound whatsoever
The object at first had exceptionally
bright red lights. As it passed over,
the lights diminished to a dull glow. The
object was shaped like an extremely
bright star, but very much larger.
There was no exhaust or flames
emanating from the object.

Handwritten observations of sighting.
The object appeared to be a bright object, hovering at a low altitude. It was observed for over 3 minutes by the witness, who was a mechanical engineer. The object was a bright, metallic, saucer-shaped object which suddenly accelerated and disappeared at high speed. It seemed to have a bright, white light on the underside which dimmed and brightened irregularly.
9:50 P.M. Eastern Standard Time
10:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time
2:15 A.M. - Memorandum
These are the precise & detailed observations as reported by the witness. The object was observed for over 3 minutes at a low altitude, estimated to be less than 1000 feet. The witness states that the object definitely was not a conventional aircraft, meteor, or other known object. He feels certain it was a UFO.

- page 70 -

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten document or report, likely related to Project Blue Book, an historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

note, the distinctly visible object of study over your family's home. It's clear that the object in question was of unusual size and shape. Its movements and behavior seem consistent with the accounts of other reported UFO sightings from that time period. The effect it had on your family suggests that its presence was quite remarkable. It's understandable that such an encounter would leave a lasting impression. This report provides a detailed first-hand account that contributes to the historical documentation of the UFO phenomenon during that era.

The image does not contain any photograph or visual content. It appears to be a handwritten document with text written in cursive.

The text in the document reads as follows:

Some description of phenomenon as seen. A bright light moved rapidly across the sky. It seemed to be descending slightly at first then leveled off and moved on a straight course for about a minute and a half traveling north to south at an estimated speed of 1000-1500 mph. The object was not visible, but a bright light reflected in the clouds below it. The light was a steady white, not blinking or pulsing.

I consider this report evaluatively potentially significant. The time of observation, location, and description of the observed phenomenon suggest it may have been an authentic UFO sighting.

Thank you.

Text output:

22 Jul 65 At approximately 2030 - 2100 hours this date many calls were received from individuals also reporting observations of UFO's. The general description cigar shaped with red exhaust. The duration varied, PAA, Allegheny and North Hills residents were contacted. The observatory and planetarium conducted that the description of objects sighted were similar to those associated with the satellite launching. 

23 Jul 65 Several reports received from residents of the Pittsburgh area. General description, oval shaped orange discs traveling in various directions.

27 Jul 65 Several reports received from local residents. Orange sphere sighted 2130 - 2200 hours, sphere rotated back and forth, dropped, then rotated and disappeared over the horizon. No flame, no noise.
Also reports of silver shaped object seen. Type reported 22 Jul 65.

1 Aug 65 Several reports received. Silver sphere object sighted. One report stated silver shaped object smaller could be seen 1635 hours. Further questioning revealed report unreliable.

3 Aug 65 Report received of high pitched whine heard 0335 hours. However, individual say nothing.

4 Aug 65 Report received of red haze in the sky 2110 hours, object sighted football in shape, no sound, about size of north star, disappeared over horizon.

7 Aug 65 Report received, red object sighted revolving as it traveled. Object about the size of a cigarette lighter moving at a fast rate of speed.

11 Aug 65 Report received, round shaped bright orange object moving at a fast rate of speed, made a whistling sound, came down low and flew over residences. Also another report of flying saucer type object moving at a fast rate of speed, further investigation.

SUMMARY: The inspecting officer has observed nothing to date. ALL reports are checked and most reports to our knowledge are unreliable and possible hoaxes. Specifically recurring given UFOs and PAA has familiarized telephone reports and because of the number of reports, forms have been reproduced for collecting individuals who claim sightings. Directions have been distributed through the Information Office that reports are to be the case media. SARO has been contacted and the current reports on Project Blue Book have been resolved. Names, addresses and phone numbers of observers reporting UFO's are kept on file. The Air Weather Bureau, other military installations in the area, Allegheny Observatory, Buhl Planetarium have been informed to contact this organization when UFOs are sighted.

22 Jul 65 At approximately 2030 - 2100 hours this date many calls were received from individuals also seen radio concerning observations of unidentified flying objects. The object(s) were described as orange disc shaped, moving rather rapidly, and descended to near the horizon where they were contacted. The Observatory and Planetarium confirmed that the objects sighted were Nova which provided their own publicity to USAF.

25 Jul 65 Several reports received from residents of the Pittsburgh area. General description, oval shaped orange disc's traveling in various directions.

27 Jul 65 Several reports received from local residents. Orange sphere sighted at about 2300 hours. Sphere moved rapidly from east to west, then rotated and disappeared over the horizon. No clue as to bizing, also reports of other shaped objects, same type reported 25 Jul 65.

1 Aug 65 Several reports received. Silver sphere object sighted. One report stated silver sphere moved rapidly, estimated speed 1930 hours. Further questioning revealed report unreliable.
