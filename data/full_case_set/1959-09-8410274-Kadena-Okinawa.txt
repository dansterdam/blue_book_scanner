THE OBSERVERS, THOUGH QUALIFIES, WERE NOT ABLE TO GIVE AN ANSWER
TO THE SIGHTING. IT IS FELT THAT THOSE OBJECTS WERE A RESULT OF
ELECTRICAL DISTURBANCES AND WEATHER PHENOMENA CAUSED BY TYPHOON
"SARAH". SPEEDS OF OBJECTS WERE REPORTED TO BE VARYING FR 52-432 KT'S
PER HOUR. THE RADAR OPERATORS STATED THAT THE OBJECTS APPEARED
BRIGHTER ON THE SCOPES THAN A T-33 ACFT WOULD. OBJECTS APPEARED ON
RADAR SCOPES AS EGG-SHAPED OR OBLONG AS IN NORMAL ACFT RETURN.
