BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The observer watched a large red colored object in the SE. The object appeared to be bright then dimmer and larger. Several people in a group saw the object also. The object appeared to show high broken clouds that night which could have accounted for the light disappearance.
The description is consistent with that of an astronomical object, most likely a bright star.
