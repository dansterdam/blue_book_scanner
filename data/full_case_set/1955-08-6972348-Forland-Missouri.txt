Remarks:
CDC Weather at ADC was contacted with respect to this report. The undersigned was informed that there was a possible temperature inversion at the time and place of the sighting. This, in connection with data contained in the report, leads this headquarters to the opinion that the sightings could have been generated by a physical inversion or possible inversion. The UFOB Index Card will not be initiated on this report. This report is forwarded as a matter of record for analysis.

Text from the document:

The information given in this report, is well-substantiated from a credible source. This appears to be a ground observation, since there were no physical or chemical evidences obtainable (no traces or landing) which could be considered (except a reflected signal (echo?) by high buildings - grain elevators, store? etc.) if might be possible to more definitely establish the source of the observations. It is advisable to establish the source of the reflections.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

There was no AF evidence on the alleged target. It was never observed to move, and even though the original target was sighted by the witnesses, it was reported to be extremely bright before and immediately after DKT was in the area, it painted only very faintly while he was flying in the general vicinity.

The target was never seen to move, but after falling would always re-appear in another location.

It never took any other form than that of an aircraft target (in other words, it never looked like AF or weather).

Even though we plotted the track on 4 - 2:35 scope, it was impossible to overlap it to "Agree" for a track number, and through it was "probably" a "freak.

The above statement made by 1st Lt JOHN V. OLIVER, USAF, Director on Duty.

The report provides information about the sighting, including the date, location, and details about the object observed. It also includes observations and measurements related to the incident.

At approximately 01:52, 25 August 1955, I was motioned to see what I could see. I noticed a bright light in the sky, as I was looking out, the bright light began to slow down perceptibly at about 100MPH. When it faded in the distance it was bright enough still to be visible. The light would reappear and paint strongly at that point but would not move, and then it disappeared completely. I called "Captain Controller, Capt. Moore," to tell him I'm certain. He said if it reappeared again he'd call "Drop Controller" to get a closer look. It reappeared again shortly and was observed about 4 miles out. When he was about 3 miles out, the target was lost, it could have made maneuvers I was not able to observe.

DR 17 did not get a visual nor was he able to make any contact on his weapon. From then on we kept watching for other light displays. But, as soon as he had the 14 after headed toward us, it disappeared. Did exactly the same thing again. The next time it came back, the 14 tC would not respond. We continued to watch for a while, but the next time it was ready to make another pass, the 14 tC was not on the air. So, from then on, the RTCC began to suspect the track. We tried unsuccessfully to contact Radar again. Maybe the RTCC was correct, but it was decided the track was not valid.

There were several things quite odd about this incident:

1. Checker of the Recorder's Logs show a definite disturbance in speed from 021:27 until 022:07 and 022:27 and 023:07. Greater than 1,000 mph. This erratic operation seems to indicate something very fast and significant.

2. A constant check of the height-finder never gave a height indication.

3. A constant check of the upper beam both by myself and by DR 17 never revealed a track going through our area, yet when it faded, it had come almost straight down.

4. This track failed about the same place that the track Lt Forr observed earlier.

"Droptastic" 17 could observe no lights above or below him through it departed the radar-observed area, where there were no small towns. It was traveling so fast that no more than 3 or 4 sweeps were obtained. The target faded from my scope.
