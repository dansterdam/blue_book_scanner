SUMMARY (Brief Digest covering miscellaneous employments, if any un t are peaseant As notes at report as PE

1. The information contained in this report concerns the sighting by two USAF officers of an unidentified flying object near Frankfurt/Main, Germany on 25 January 1953. The officers, Lt. Col. Max O. Mitchell and Major David *, Pearsall, both members of he ATT Branch, are rated pilots and have been on flying status for several years, They are considered to be exceptionally reliable.

 2. Information concerning their experience is presented in reproduced copies of the U.S, Air Force Technical Information Sheet attached as Inclosures 1 and 2. Immediately after the sighting, Lt. Col. Mitchel wrote on a blank AP vorm 4 a descrip fion of the event. This description, a good summary of the sighting, is quoted verbatim in order to prevent any misstatement of facts surrounding the incident.

"On the night of 25 January 1955 at 1952 hours I observed the following phenomena. We were on top of an overcast at 7500 ft., flying on a beading of Oberurs el for all practical purposes unlimited. Temperature was O co. I sighted a vary bright light passing in front of us at a slight S@) elevation above is from our left to right. I called Major Pearsall's attention to the light and we both watched it move to our sight parallelly remarking that the light was moving at an oxtremely high rate of speed. In a s ew seconds it turned to the North (very high acceleration or turn moting and then turned again in front of us climbing slightly until it was straight ahead of us again, where it seemed  t o linger. The Majud judged at this time to be S-10 miles ahead of us. Then the light made several sturns naveying from just above the horizon to 15 o above the horizon. Then it paused for a few soconds, made several more maneuvers (as though in a dogfight) and then disappeared at a very high rate of speed to the North. ** reported this phenomena to Pankavrt airways and Corseleb. The object was in sight for only a total of approximately 1-1/2 minutes. I held a heading of o# all of this time. "

 5. It has come to the attention of the reporting officer that an unidentified flying object was sighted at about the same time and location by another USAF officer. This sighting was reported in PRI-60#5-55, dated 30 january 1953, from the 60th Troop Carrier Wing, Medium at Rhein Main Abs Base, Panerfort/Main Germany.

4. The 1900 hours Zebra weather reported at Rhein Ham Afr Base was:
 
A. No precipitation
B. 5/3 stratocumulus cloud coverage, base 3000 ft., tops 8000 ft, 3/8 stratus
cloud coverage at 1200 ft, scatter clouds at 20,000 ft.

3. The fact (old German sketch) section that this figure is at 70° above the horizon, the others aligned A at 180°, C at 160°. It was over this house at F, Stuttgart Meadows. It is bounded by green trees and in my sketch two sightings appear closer to me, (ufologist colored sketches). The color is typical Stuttgart blue, Greece (Belgian navy with light green earthy tones).

3. a) In the following sketch a majestic saucer appears at this position. Notice the display of green hues and the cosmic blue skies as the small figure points skyward, testifying to the magnificence of Stuttgart's town witness.

(SUNJACT 986).

It is desired that you indicate (by way of brief and general statement) all your qualifications and/or knowledge for analyzing and evaluating (based strictly on their technical aspects) the incidents involving "flying saucers, flying discs or aerial phenomenon of somewhat similar nature, i.e., your professional background, general and specialized engineering experience, medical knowledge, publications and/or articles written, etc. (This information is used for verification purposes and will be considered confidential, if so marked by you. See attached "General Information for Women's Panel on Engineering and Technical Assistance".)

13 February 1953

On the morning of 24 January 1953, Mr. Eckert (flash) point type light moved across the western sky at . about 5000 feet altitude.. The object was moving from north to south good visibility. He could see the silhouette of a “bullous shaped object. He stated that there was an indistinguishable noise accompanying this lighted object which appeared to him to be coming from an exceptionally high speed jet aircraft. There was no other sound other than a sound of “treet” hissing air. Object continued on south at a high rate of speed before vanishing out of sight after about 5 seconds.

On the evening of 25 January 1953, while cruising over Katowice, Poland, my radar man announced that we were being scrubbed by an unidentified aircraft to our rear at range of from 10 to 12 miles. I ordered highest speed my craft (500 mph) the unidentified aircraft ranged from 5 to 7 miles at the same or greater speed. After a few minutes following this action, this aircraft launched 4 missile(like objects from beneath object. The missiles travelled across the sky with incredible speed in a south-westerly direction where one over Czeckovakia, object merged into what appeared to be “string” of light, which lasted for 5 seconds and then dissolved and was identified in the radar scope. This unidentified aircraft immediately broke off from me toward the mountains at a very high speed. It seemed to be “tumbling” but unidentifiable.

On the night of 26 January 1953, our radar man spotted an unidentifiable object on the scope two miles to our left at a lower altitude with speed three times that of a normal jet aircraft closing in on our position in a sw pressence. As this unidentifiable object closed in,” I could, at times , make out what were unidentifiable, random lights of different sizes and colors. Object remained motionless just outside of radar til I attempted to identify it closer. I could identify no markings or positions which caused me to be highly skeptical. I ordered evasive action and dove to nearly tree top height to straighten out radar man upon leveling did not relocate this unidentifiable object either scope or visually.

Descriptive Data: Object was circular in shape very large at times and small at times that I was able to visualize. Object either radiated its own light or was of such a material as to allow it to observe light from any various direction. Object seemed to be controlled by a much higher intelligence then we have and for fear of causing possible misunderstanding and misinterpretation. Compliments were unusable except to constitute “funvee.” These observations were observed during 12 to 16 hours of oncoming flying and I was very much ill at the time and I lack much.

It is to be noted that on the evenings of these observations we were performing border patrol and reconnoitering over Poland and Czeckovakia. A number of differerent unidentifiable objects were encountered and were sighted during the time period but because of safety reasons I was unable to devote my fullest attention to each and cite. Have noted most relevent and rememberable occurrence.

The above observations are in compliance with instructions from Headquartes containing information designed which is in compliance with security regulations. Signature, XXX, Major, Air FgtCon , ALTILING - NOT ALTERNATIVE

Frankfurt/Main, Germany, 26 Jan 53, ATIC Document 111619

Air-visual sighting by two USAF pilots flying a C-47 over this locality state that
both pilots sighted a very bright light passing in front of them at an elevation of
about 45° moving from their left to right. Appeared to be moving at a very high
rate of speed. In a few seconds it turned to the North and then turned again in
front of the observers, climbing slightly until it was directly ahead of them, where
it seemed to linger and then go out of sight. The object was sighted for a total of
approximately 1 1/2 minutes. The pilot was on a heading of 0° during the entire
period of sighting. Weather was clear with a slight temperature inversion between
3 to 4,000’. A check with the Frankfurt Flight Service by the pilots revealed the
information that no jet aircraft were operating in the vicinity of Rhein Main at
the time of sighting, However, other C-47’s were flying in the vicinity and might
account for the sighting.
