UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

At 11:45 hours on November 17, 1967, a report was made to USAF OSRAC IDAHO, Ucon, Idaho, reported to the USAF OSRAC IDAHO that an unidentified flying object was observed during the evening of November 16, 1967. Mrs. U. S. Hignite, 191 person living at the time. She stated her location was about one and one-half miles east of Beech Corner, when this large, bright object came over a field on her left. It seemed to have many green and blue lights on it.

It is our understanding that the U. S. Air Force has a compilation of reports on U.F.O. sightings, and it was determined that Mrs. Cook considered a contact which could not be established with her until 1305 hours on November 17, 1967. This conversation is reported in the form of questions and answers as follows:

Question: What was the approximate time you observed the object?
Answer: It was about 6:15 p.m. on November 16, 1967.

Question: What were the weather conditions?
Answer: The sky was clear; but, of course, it was dark. Here there any other witness? 
Answer: I was driving alone at the time and don't know if anyone else observed it.

Question: Could you describe the shape and size of the object?
Answer: It seemed oblong and similar to a large meteor. Although I didn't think of it as being a meteor. It was larger, brighter, and closer than any I have ever seen. I could not guess at the size. It was somewhat like looking at the moon you know it is large but you can't tell how large.

Question: Did you detect any sound from the object?
Answer: No.

November 20, 1957

Question: What was the direction and speed of flight?
Answer: It came from the east and disappeared over a field to the west. It approached in a diagonal direction and seemed to be traveling at a steady pace. I would say its speed was about 40 miles per hour.

Question: How did you observe the object, and did you stop your car?
Answer: I observed it from the car window while driving. I would not stop the car. I did not stop the car. I would have if it had landed near.

Question: What was the approximate height from the ground at all times and the distance from you at its nearest point?
Answer: I couldn't guess at the height when I first saw it, but it glided down to about 30 feet off the ground when it passed the highway. The nearest it came to me I would estimate to be about one-half mile distant.

Question: Describe any system of lights and colors you observed.
Answer: Actually, I guess there weren't any definite lights, but the glow seemed bluish-green in color. It seemed to be self-luminous, not reflecting any other source.

Mr. Gray would add nothing more to the incident since the object was in view for only 30 seconds.
