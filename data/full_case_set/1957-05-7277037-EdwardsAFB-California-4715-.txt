1. The following information is submitted in accordance with AFR 200-2:

a. Date of Sighting: 7 May 1957
b. Time of Sighting: 1005 hours 
c. Location of Sighting: Edwards AFB, California
d. Source of Information: Private citizen

2. A private citizen reported seeing an unidentified object at Edwards AFB, California on 7 May 1957 at 1005 hours. The object was observed for approximately one minute and was described as round in shape, silver in color, and approximately 40 feet in diameter. The object was observed to move in a straight line at a high rate of speed and then accelerate and disappear from sight.

3. This report has been investigated and evaluated. It is the opinion of the investigator that the reported sighting was an aircraft of conventional design which was operating in the local area. This evaluation is based on the reported characteristics of the object and the fact that aircraft of similar description are known to operate in the vicinity of Edwards AFB.

OBJECT SIGHTED OVER EDWARDS AFB, CALIFORNIA 
1. On 7 May 1957, at approximately 2030 hours, 2 objects were sighted over Edwards AFB, California. 
2. The objects were observed from the control tower at Edwards AFB by several tower personnel. 
3. The objects were described as bright, self-luminous objects which appeared to be hovering or moving slowly in the sky. 
4. The objects were observed for approximately 10-15 minutes before disappearing from view.
5. No attempt was made to pursue or intercept the objects.

The image appears to be a series of black and white photographic frames, likely part of a Project Blue Book UFO report document. The frames show various views of what appears to be the same object, with vertical and horizontal lines dividing the individual frames. There are no clearly identifiable objects or subjects within the frames.
