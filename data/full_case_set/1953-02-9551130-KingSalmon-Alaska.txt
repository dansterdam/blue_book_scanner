On 6 February 1953 at 2055 A.M.P.S.T., the Officer in Charge Station reported that the 705th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron received a report from King Salmon, Alaska that a light was sighted in the sky to the west of the field. Nothing unusual could be determined by further investigation. The tower stated for sure information and was informed that the object had disappeared.

1550 hours, King Salmon, Alaska is an isolated G.C.A. airfield located at 58-41N 156-39W. There are no weather observers at King Salmon Airport to report they had not sent up any balloons that day. The only air traffic in the area was very clear and the temperature was very comfortable.

5. The Chief Controller later interviewed Staff Mr. Chief Airways Operations Specialist (Airport), WILLIAM M. DAISEY (Communications) 705th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Seattle, Washington. All administration personnel and all saw the light. Their signed statements are attached. The matter is still under investigation at the time of the interview from land marks observed at the time of the sighting.

STATEMENT

I, Victor Mailer, Aircraft Communications Operator residing at King Salmon, Alaska, make the following statement:

On 7 February 1952 at approximately 2207I, I received a call from the control tower operator at King Salmon CAA Control Center. I was in my quarters at the time and was instructed to go to the control tower immediately.

Upon arrival at the tower, I observed the light for about 1-2 minutes. The light appeared to be approximately 15-20 miles south of King Salmon, Alaska. It was a bright, steady, white light, and there was no definite movement to indicate it was an aircraft. The light seemed to be just hovering in one place. There was no definite movement to indicate it was an aircraft. The light seemed to be just hovering in one place.

After observing the light for about 1-2 minutes, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight in about 5-10 seconds. The direction of flight was toward the south. At the time I observed this light, there were no aircraft in the area that I was aware of. The light was observed to be at an approximate altitude of 15,000 feet. The entire observation lasted about 1-2 minutes.

The above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

The text in the document is as follows:

CLASSIFIED

INCIDENT

On 7 February 1953, at about 2200 hours, the undersigned was standing near the King Salmon Airport when he observed a very bright light in the sky. The light appeared when Plane No. 128 was taking off from the airport. The light was observed to be traveling at a high rate of speed and changing direction very rapidly. It was going from one position or altitude to another position or altitude at a speed which made it impossible to follow with the eyes. The light disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared. This incident was verified by the tower operator and other observers at the airport. No unusual sounds were heard.

The above is a voluntary statement and is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

"STATEMENT

I, Mrs. Marcelle L. Adair, residing at King Salmon, Alaska make the following statement:

During the evening of 6 February 1953 at approximately 10:30 p.m. Alaska Standard Time, I observed a strange object in the sky west of my home. The light was a reddish-orange when I first observed it, and it changed to a whitish-orange, then to a bluish-white as it moved slowly overhead. The light appeared to be about 10-12 feet in diameter and about 25 feet above the ground. There was no sound and it did not appear to rotate or vibrate. The light was visible for about 10 minutes and then it disappeared. This is a true and correct statement to the best of my knowledge.

I will now perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document and provide the output:

I, 1st Lt William F. Farley, AC 712 732, make the following statement:

On 7 February 1953 while on duty as observer in a C-47 aircraft (AF 9942) on a routine operational training flight, I observed the following:

At approximately 4:00 p.m. the pilot of the aircraft, Captain Donato from King Salmon, Alaska airport, sighted an unidentified object on the horizon approximately 10 miles away. It was described as being approximately twice the size of a C-47 aircraft and was flying at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet. The object was observed for several minutes and was moving so fast that it was from horizon to horizon in approximately 30 seconds. It flew a straight and level course.

I then interviewed Mrs Marcelle L. Adair, wife of Capt Adair, who corroborated the sighting. From her account, I gathered that Mrs Adair was also observing the object from the ground at King Salmon Airport. She stated positively that the object gave the impression of being metallic and disc-shaped and approximately twice the size of a C-47 aircraft. She also stated that the object was observed for several minutes and disappeared suddenly. She also seemed to be a very reliable and intelligent person.

I interviewed the weather officer at the airport and found weather conditions to be normal, with no unusual meteorological phenomena. The high pressure center was still stationed over the area at 10,000 feet.
