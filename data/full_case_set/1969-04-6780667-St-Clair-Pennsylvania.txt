ALTERNATIVELY PROVIDE A NARRATIVE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING:

It was a normal night. I was standing outside my home watching the sky when I noticed a light moving across the sky. It appeared to be very bright and was descending rapidly. As it got closer, I could see that it was a solid object, not an aircraft. It hovered silently for a few moments, then shot off at an incredible speed. The whole incident lasted less than a minute. I am not sure what I saw, but it did not seem to be any kind of conventional aircraft.

Dear Sir:

Your letter has been referred to me regarding the incident that occurred on April 17, 1960. There were no photographs or other physical evidence obtained in this case. I wish I could give you more definite and complete information, but the facts, as we have them, are rather limited. The incident appeared to have been a genuine sighting, but it is difficult to determine exactly what the object was that was observed. I will be glad to discuss this matter further with you if you have any additional questions.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]

GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION INDICATING WHAT CAUSED YOU TO BELIEVE YOU OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. INDICATE HOW IT APPEARED, WHETHER IT WAS SOLID OR TRANS-PARENT, WHETHER IT GAVE OFF SMOKE OR FLAME, OR SEMED TO INDICATE ANY UNUSUAL FEATURES.

It looked like a sort of glowing cloud that took on a peculiar reddish cast and a long trail or streamer behind it. As it came nearer, it seemed to take on more of a distinct form, although still rather amorphous, and there seemed to be some kind of "engine" or "propulsion" at the rear, although it was difficult to make out any detail. It was moving rather rapidly, estimated at 500-600 mph, and the bluish glow around the object seemed to indicate some kind of propulsion system, although it gave off no flame or smoke. The movement was smooth and steady with no apparent motion of the "engines," and it seemed to be under intelligent control.
