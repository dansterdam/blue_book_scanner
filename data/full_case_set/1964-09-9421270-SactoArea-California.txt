VICTOR W. KILLICK
SACRAMENTO, CALIF.
Phone 442-5227

Sept. 9.

To the Commanding Officer,
Master Air Force Base,
Mather Field, Sacramento, Calif.

Dear Sir:

During the last 12 years the writer has had charge of a observatory at Sacramento City College in the course of our operations which deal largely with celestial objects.

Most of the reported sightings concern astronomical objects I have never had a phone call or a report from anyone who has seen a flying saucer except last Saturday afternoon a woman, unknown to me, phoned and stated that her son-in-law had seen some strange lights in the sky the previous night. As I was not present at the time I am unable to say what the nature of this sighting was.

I replied that we had a report of a brilliant meteor which had occurred on Thursday night. On Friday evening a woman called my residence stating that her son-in-law had reported this to me on Thursday evening for details on what her son-in-law had observed. I told her that the incident had been reported to me and that I had replied to him.

He told me that shortly after sundown on Thursday night he had observed quite a brilliant light descending in the Sierra Nevada mountains in a southeasterly direction. It descended below the horizon very rapidly. I mentioned that this was most likely a brilliant meteor which sometimes give this impression of descending on the horizon and then disappearing below. There was no evidence of any discolored sky or any maneuver which would indicate a flying saucer, he is rather impressed with what he saw and was quite excited about it. I was able to assure him that this was a natural phenomenon and not a flying saucer.

I hope this information is helpful to you. If I can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to call upon me.

Sincerely yours,
Victor W. Killick

Text transcribed from the document:

On Sept. 4th. I received another telephone call from a young lady who said she was at my home and apparently connected from there with my other telephone, together with his brother. They brought along a long distance message that was given in conjunction with a direct telephone call.

I told them that the Air Force may want to investigate this matter. I do not plan to discuss publically, and gave assurances that confidentiality was attached to it.

If you desire to have the material investigated by an individual or organization you consider proper and rational, The carefully attentive military personnel have no story. They told me that I did give the report and cooperate without success. I have a certain degree of regretability, and sincerity. 

You desire to have this matter privately and confidentially, and your family will continue without the public and public disclouse. 

Yours very truly,
Victor W. Killick
