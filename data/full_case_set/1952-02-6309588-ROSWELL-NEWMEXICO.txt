FLYING SAUCER THEORY EXPLODED:
MYSTERY OF BALL OF FIRE SOLVED

By JAMES ELLIOT

Remembering that taking the fantastic thoughts of flying saucers and some connected theories told us only about the limits of imagination rather than real facts, this report today discloses what the phenomenon really was - a "ball of fire."

Last February, the phenomenon was sighted several times. And since that time, astronomical thoughts have increased rather than diminished. Why? Because the reports, which on their face seemed to be of "flying saucers," have now been traced to a "ball of fire" - something more rational and less fantastic than the saucer theory.

BASED ON THE ACCOUNTS

According to the accounts, this "ball of fire" was seen only for a few seconds by observers in at least three states who saw the brilliant flash-like glow which part of the world's scientists said was impossible. From that point, two miles south of Buffalo City, N.C., it is stated the "ball of fire" flashed into sight at 11:34 A.M. and was visible to residents of three states despite the clear Chesapeake Bay weather. It fell into the bay, the report said, about 15 minutes before disappearance.

DATE OF DISTRIBUTION: FEBRUARY 27, 1953

This report contains an account of an incident that occurred on July 8, 1952, in Roswell, New Mexico. The report provides details about the incident and the investigation that followed.

The report mentions that the object was first sighted by several people, including a ranch foreman, and that the object was estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter. The report also mentions that the object was found on a ranch and that the area was secured and investigated by military personnel.

The report concludes with a summary of the findings and the conclusion that the object was likely a "high-altitude research balloon" and not an unidentified flying object.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Report date: 7-2-52
Description: Pilots sighted an unidentified object flying at approximately the same altitude as their aircraft. The object could be determined as to size, shape or color. It appeared as a small, bright, round, metallic-looking object. No sound was heard and the object left no visible trail or exhaust. No further information was determined on the characteristics of the object.
Meteorological conditions: Temperature (12), visibility unlimited, broken at 18,000 feet, scattered (7/8ths) at 25,000 feet, wind 270 degrees at 25 knots. The weather conditions were such that temperature would not cause distortion.
Conclusions: The object appeared to be a reflection on the aircraft windshield, possibly a mirage effect. No firm conclusions could be drawn as to the identity of the object.
