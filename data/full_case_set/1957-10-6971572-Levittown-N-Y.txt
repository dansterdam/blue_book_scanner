Time Commenced first, via Mai Bogma - Levittown, N.y. Oct 6, 1957
Flying object noticed at 2:05 a.m. by observer, who reported rapidly north to south. At 2:07, an air craft loc. 2 miles east of Kirtland, Utah, fast bound on victor to appear rather unusual, quick pointed or jaillike from pile at an angle of 35 degrees to the earth and moving out at 25 miles east of Provo, Utah. Speed was estimated as Mach-1. Air Defense Command reported missile crossed his path, one 35,000 ft., 37,000 ft. and 33,000 ft., respectively were observed and gave locations of crash as Kirtland, Utah. The object was larger than the aircraft but not much. Brilliant objects were also observed. Checked with Central and Western forces, and they have no missing aircraft. The case is still under preliminary search and found nothing. No investigation taken as yet but I know of. No plane noise. Denver police stations stated they had received reports from persons observing the object.

The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather a newspaper article with the headline "AF Believes 'Fireball' Was Meteor". The article discusses a report from the North American Air Defense Command that an unidentified flying object seen over Pennsylvania was likely a meteor and not a fireball, as initially believed by some observers.

The text of the article is as follows:

AF Believes 'Fireball' Was Meteor
"The North American Air Defense Command said today the "fireball" reported in the sky over Pennsylvania Thursday morning was probably a meteor.
The Air Force investigating team which rushed to the area said they found no evidence of any crash or debris from a plane. They reported the object was probably a meteor which broke up as it entered the atmosphere.
Residents of Levittown, Pa., and surrounding areas had reported seeing a bright object streaking across the sky and apparently breaking up.
"It was a run-away satellite or meteor," said the Air Force. "We found no evidence of any airplane accident." The command said the "fireball" had been tracked on radar."

Here is the text extracted from the document using OCR:

THE INDIANAPOLIS STAR

Big Fireball Traverses Western U.S. Sky

Denver, Oct. 6 - A brilliant fiery object flashed across the sky from Colorado to Utah last night, the National Air Defense Command reported yesterday. It whirred so swiftly southward that it appeared to be a guided missile, but it was believed to have been a natural phenomenon, possibly a meteor.

The 15-man crew of the Transport plane said the fiery object came from the north, flashed through the sky, and disappeared over the horizon to the south, some 15 minutes later. The craft was flying at 30,000 feet when the fireball first was sighted. In addition to the crew, a number of persons on the ground also reported seeing the object.

Lt. Col. Paul Anderson, public information officer at Lowry Air Force Base, east of Denver, said observers described the object as being "as bright as magnesium flares." It was a bluish green in color and left a trail of orange sparks, he said.

Anderson said the object flashed by the Transport plane so swiftly that it appeared to have burned out about 1 second after being sighted.

"December 2, 1957

Dr. George Whipple
Astrophysical Observatory
Cambridge 38, Mass.

Dear Dr. Whipple:

Recently I made a fireball survey which revealed a situation that is frightening and I think perhaps you are the man who can do something about it.

On October 10, 1957, I was pilot of Lt. Commander Keyhoe, USNR, when we made a search for the reported sighting near Seix Flags over Texas. Just before reaching Seix Flags, we sighted a large fireball over Salt Lake City, which was much brighter than the one he had seen. It appeared to be rapidly descending. I proceeded to chase it and measured its speed at over 3,000 mph. It went to the ground northeast of Salt Lake City, within 30 miles. I immediately reported this to control tower and the Air Force. There were many sightings of this fireball as it was widely separated points but the north American Aerospace Command did not seem to know anything about it.
I suppose they worked on the theory that if it did hit the ground there would be no trace and so there was no point in investigating. I do not know why the Air Force and the military hid this object from the public. But I do know that my observation of its tremendous speed and its flight path strongly suggest that this was no meteor. Pilots all over the United States are doing their utmost to report anything unusual in the sky and yet we seem to meet with only apathy and ridicule.
The point is my survey has revealed that there were many hundreds of reports of these fireballs seen all over the country on that night and some on other nights too. The pattern of their behavior suggests they may be a reality a secret American or Russian missile program that we have never heard of.
I am certain that these are not meteors or comets and I am getting more concerned. There were over 10 major observations in the Midwest alone that night, extending over several hundred miles, and the characteristics were far too consistent and far too rapid for meteors.
I feel this is a matter of great urgency and I would like to know if you can do anything further to investigate this situation and perhaps you may be able to enlist other observatories in this work. If these objects are controlled as I very much suspect, then heaven help us, for they are obviously far in advance of our own programs.
I should be very grateful if you would let me know if you can do anything in this direction.

Yours sincerely,

FRANK HALSTEAD
BOX 426, SEDONA, ARIZONA"

It is of great coniidence in is necessary. Inasmuch as the information being furnished under the conditions of Project. But that it, is not the point of this letter. 
From official of the Jorth American Defense Command, it appears that neither the ment have been able to ientity and locate the object described in the sight similar survey, through the post 36 hours, and that all of the observation was determined to be false or of more in nature. It appears the visual and radar observations are valid, but that the object having disappeared-threat under present international conditions.
The DENVER POST OFFICF concerning the disappearance of this object. Anyone who nowledcerning the movement either the bject, or any similar unidentified object in their vicinity, could it approbcitively let this officT know. It is possible that any sighting or location data would be considerable nce in determining the character and the status of this sighting.
From now on, it appears to me that unless these is a positive reports from responsible observers will be entered into official recorthe s o n it will be considered indication of existence of some international cataclysmic-dL.hna. This would indicate in my opinion an extremely dangerous situation confronting our country and liberty, and literally bankrupt our country with some destructive action necessary would be considered. It is my hope that some means of correcting this extremely dangerous situation.

Transcription of the text in the document:

December 12, 1957

Dear Harry:

Your letter of December 2 is a very important one and I am pleased to tell you that I will do what I can to assist you in your investigation and analysis of the sightings. I will be glad to send you any information I can regarding the sighting, and I will also ask you for your permission and that of your friend to do more detailed work on the analysis. Your findings as to a good description of exactly how the sighting occurred would be most helpful to us, and I suspect that many other similar sightings may be usable by publication of this that might be unavailable by public account of this that might be unavailable by public release. I intend to discuss this carefully with the various persons concerned, and pass them around among the various departments and students.

In this field of endeavor much remains to be done, and your cooperation may be most helpful. Hope everything is going well with you.

Sincerely,

Fred T. Whipple
