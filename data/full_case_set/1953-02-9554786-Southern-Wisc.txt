SUMMARY: Lt. Williams reported that on the evening of 7 February 1953, he observed an unidentified object in the sky over Southern Wisconsin, which appeared to be more than 50 feet in diameter. The object was observed to move erratically, increasing and decreasing in speed, and exhibiting an extra brilliant white light. Weather at the time of observation was clear with visibility unlimited. Observers were unable to estimate size, altitude or speed of the object. The object did not register on radar screens at this station. No further details are provided in the report.

The report is signed by Lieutenant Colonel W.H. Hitt, Operations Officer.
