CASE OF ALLEGED SIGHTING 

BASIC INFORMATION: 

1. Date/Time Group: 2-23-66/2035I 
2. Location: Omaha, Nebraska 
3. Source: AF Form 112 
4. Summary of Sighting - WITNESS OBSERVED BRIGHT LIGHT IN SKY WHICH HOVERED IN ONE SPOT FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. LIGHT THEN MOVED OFF AT HIGH SPEED.

INITIAL REPORT: Witness telephoned reporting a bright light in the sky which hovered in one spot for about 10 minutes. The light then moved off at a high rate of speed. Witness was unable to identify the source of the light. CAPT J.T. MAYNE interviewed the witness, who appeared reliable and rational. CAPT MAYNE stated the sighting did not appear to be of conventional aircraft and recommended further investigation. 

INVESTIGATION AND FINDINGS:

After evaluating all available information, CAPT MAYNE concluded that the object observed was an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The object exhibited characteristics not consistent with any known conventional aircraft or other aerial vehicle. The sighting was reported promptly and the witness appeared to be sincere and reliable. CAPT MAYNE recommended no further investigation was warranted since no additional information was likely to be obtained.

Dear Major Quintanilla:
In reply to your letter of Aug. 4, enclosing four reports on objects seen night of July 13/14, 1966 from the Omaha,Neb. area, I have now gone over them carefully.
My opinion is that they refer to two ob-jects. The first has seven reports for roughly 1 1/2/0400 to the other for 1 1/2/0600 Z-and that seems a very rational scene as to observed data. This latter duration was approximately 2 minutes, which of course is quite the same.
The reports roughly from N towards S or SE. The reportsexcept for any variations then usual except for the second being 10 seconds, usually persist for 10 seconds, usually peri-odically to disappearance.
None of the objects have UFO characteristics that you may be especially concerned with as meteors, etc.
I hope this helps.if you feel any further study or follow up in that is needed, please indicate.
Sincerely yours,
AMERICAN METER SOCIETY
BETHLEHEM, PA. 9-9-72

Dear Dr. Olivier,

Reference the so-called unidentified flying object reports from the Nebraska area. These sightings appear to be better observations. However, the sightings would be compatible with observations of conventional aircraft.

We still have not received any late reports from the Norfolk, Virginia area.

Any assistance you may be able to provide on the Nebraska sightings would be appreciated.

Sincerely,

JAMES E. MCDONALD, Major, USAF

An Force Sighting Command

Attn:
Gentlemen:

On Wednesday, July 13, at approximately 10:10 p.m. I saw the object in the south western sky. We started to observe it and we could distinguish a deep red-orange colored object. There were distinct fluctuations in the light intensity where the outer edges of the object became brighter and then dimmer, giving the illusion of a pulsation. As it moved, it's light fluctuation increased. It stayed in close proximity to the horizon. I observed it until approx. 10:40 p.m. when it gradually faded from view.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
