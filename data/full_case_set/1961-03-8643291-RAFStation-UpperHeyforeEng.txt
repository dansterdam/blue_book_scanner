There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains a typed text document, which appears to be an excerpt from a report related to Project Blue Book. I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

PAGE FIVE RJDXG0 11
H. NOTHING UNUSUAL THAT CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGHTING. 
I. NO INTERCEPTION ACTION TAKEN.
J. THERE WAS NO AIR TRAFFIC OR KNOWN BALLOON RELEASE IN THE
 AREA TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGHTING.
K. THE BASE INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, RAF UPPER HEYFORD IS THE PREPARING OFFICER OF THIS REPORT. THE OFFICERS DID NO WITNESS THE UFO. THE ONLY THEORY THAT HAS THUS FAR BEEN ADVANCED
IS THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A TEMPERATURE INVERSION CAUSING
SECTIONS OF CLOUD DRIFTING WITH THE WIND. THIS WOULD ACCOUNT
RADAR RETURN. THE BRIGHT LIGHT CANNOT BE SO EASILY ACCOUNTED
ALL THE OBSERVERS INDICATE THAT THE LIGHT WAS VERY BRIGHT, T
SEEN TO NEGATE ANY THEORY OF REFLECTION. THE HEADINGS OF THE
AS TRACKED BY RADAR WERE MORE OR LESS CONSISTENT WITH THE WI
JECTIONS AT THE TIME. THE REPORTING OFFICER CAN OFFER NO LOG
PLANATION FOR THE SIGHTING. THERE WERE NO AIRCRAFT OR BALLOON
THE AREA THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGHTING AND INVESTIGA
TURNED UP NO INDICATIONS OF BALLOONS IN THE VICINITY. AIRCRAFT
TRAFFIC WAS NONEXISTENT AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING. THE MIDLAND
CONTROL HAD NO AIRCRAFT TRAFFIC FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS
21/05252.
