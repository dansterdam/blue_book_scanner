"Saucers" Sighted By Shelby Residents

Shelby, April 10 - Five Shelby residents believe they saw flying objects in the sky over Shelby Saturday night, the commander of the Foreign Wars Post here said today in a report on the sightings.

He said the objects were spotted at about 8:30 p.m. Saturday and were in the sky for at least two minutes, traveling at a high speed. He said they were seen by at least five persons.

The commander said the objects appeared to be round, about the size of a wash tub, and had a glow around them. He said they appeared to be two or three in number, and that they disappeared suddenly, as if they had shot straight up into the air.
