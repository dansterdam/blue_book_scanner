The image appears to contain a photograph, but it does not depict any human faces. The text is titled "THE PAUL VILLA SAUCER PHOTOS" and describes photographs taken by Paul Villa, a mechanic of the Los Angeles Air Force Base, who claimed to have seen and photographed a flying saucer in 1952. The text explains that Villa was able to photograph the saucer and its occupants telepathically, and that he had a good knowledge of much phenomenon. However, the text does not mention or identify any individuals in the photographs.

THE PAUL VILLA SAUCER PHOTOS

Most of the saucer photos we have been told are visually inferior quality, usually discredited, while the story behind this particular case seems to be one of the most astonishing and authentic that we have on record. 

Paul Villa (in 1952), a mechanic of the Los Angeles Air Force Base, claims to have seen and photographed a flying saucer. He says he was able to get these photos because of his unusual ability to see and communicate with "Space People" for the specific purpose of taking their pictures. 

Villa says that prior to 1952 he had been taught telepathically by "extraterrestrials" to communicate with them and take their pictures. He seems to have a good knowledge of much metaphysical information, which may be advanced by their teaching.

Villa says that prior to photographing his first saucer in 1952, he had talked with a spaceman previously. He said this being had told him something of their mission and that they were here for a special purpose, to increase public interest in them. Villa was instructed to tell his story to the Department of Water and Power in Los Angeles. This he did but they did not then understand.

There is a man about 5 feet 8 inches tall that Villa says he saw and communicated with. This person told Villa he was from a planet 15 light years distant. They realized that he was communicating with a very advanced intelligence, and he has since given them much information for our benefit. Villa says the "Space People" have our Earth's best interests at heart.

Then the spaceman asked me if I would like to see the craft and photographed the craft and flying maneuvers. Villa said the saucer occupants were entirely human in appearance, similar to us physically but very advanced in intelligence and technology. They radiated a warmth and glow and gave an impression of peace and friendliness. Villa realizes that he was chosen for this mission because of his advanced knowledge of science, as evidenced by their teaching him much previously unknown to our scientists.

Villa says that the advanced craft demonstrate that our Earth belongs to a grain of sand on a huge intergalactic organism. In relation to the unimaginable numbers of inhabited planets in our galaxy, our civilization here seems quite small and insignificant. The advanced technology and intelligence far surpass our own, demonstrating how much more there is yet for us to learn.

Villa states that he believes the Space People are in our skies. It seems that their craft are constantly coming and going over our surface, and that they plan more open contact.

The image appears to contain a photograph of a cloud formation that is described as resembling an Indian-shaped object. The text mentions that this photograph was taken shortly after another photograph, and that the cloud formation is still visible although it has moved due to a slow shutter speed.

The document appears to be an old Project Blue Book report, and the text discusses various details related to UFO sightings and photographic evidence. It mentions the locations of the sightings, the physical descriptions of the objects observed, and the perspectives of the observers.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. government program that investigated unidentified flying object (UFO) reports between 1952 and 1969.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

after the time these photos were released to us, there was a rush of saucer-sighting reports. They began on April 24, 1965 from an Indian reservation near Albuquerque, New Mexico. A team of investigators from the Air Force and the University of Colorado went to the area. There the Indian-shaped cloud is still visible, although it has moved due to a slow shutter speed. The craft appears to be moving. Photo #5 was taken shortly after photo #1, and shows a more distinct image of the Indian-shaped cloud, still visible, although moving. The three crewmen had light brown hair and tan skin. While searching the trees, they came upon what appeared to be a landed gas-shaped object, but the object was gone when they returned to the exact spot. Much new interest was stimulated in the saucer-sighting and #6 it appears to be the only good photographs of a Navajo Indian "flying saucer" with a central dome, a series of portholes or "windows" around the "dome" section, and a distinct separation or "chine" between the "dome" and the main craft section below. Paul Villa's saucer photographs have made a such an impression on the international photographers that even people will be quick to say that they never order photographs, we counter that. We ask them to consider the following: 1) the photos met our editors' requirements as verified by experts. 2) the craft is clearly observed, and from that viewpoint, any photographic object would have to be very special to gain that kind of exposure with reputable international photographers (in addition to your editor).

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a typed letter from the Project Blue Book Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base regarding some photographs that were sent in for analysis.

August 26, 1964

Dear Mr. *****,

Enclosed are the photographs which you brought over us and asked to have analyzed.

Our Project Blue Book Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has analyzed the set of photographs and finds them to be approximately 14 inches in diameter and 7 inches tall. The photographs are stated to be 20 inches in diameter and 14 inches tall. Photograph #2 shows the UFO at a close range with passing lights visible on the right side of the object and in a second set of flashing lights which are further away. Therefore the object is between the two sets of flashing lights which is further away. The project office considers the photographs to be a genuine UFO sighting.

If humanoids were inside of this alleged flying saucer, they would have to be 7 inches tall. The Project Office considers the photographs to be a genuine UFO sighting.

The photograph alleged fighting which lead to the photograph of the other object has never been officially received.

Sincerely,

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
DATE OF REPORT: 20 August 1964
SUBJECT: UFO
LOCATION: Albuquerque, New Mexico
DATE: 16 June 1963
PHOTOGRAPHY: Quality - Fair to Good
FMB - Photos returned to TDMI.
1. PURPOSE: This report answers WD #64-72 from Major Quintanilla (TDMI) to determine if an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) is a hoax or real.
2. ANALYSIS: The photographs have a sky background with an unobstructed view of the object. It seems unlikely that anyone photographing a UFO from several angles would have all good clear images.
The photograph #7 shows the UFO at close range with a leafless branch on the left side of the object. The two branch are not obscuring the image of the object. It is possible that these twigs are from the tree on the right which are further away. Therefore, the object appears to be a sharper image than the near and far parts of the photograph.
In photographs #1 and #2 the object appears to be a sharper image than the near and far parts of the photographs. This indicates the UFO is between the three and the camera.

Flying Saucer Mystery Still Unso!
BY HAYDEN C. HEWES Associate Director, UFOS
Today, as scientific space leading statements are being made concerning the probability of the existence of planets other than those in our solar system, another old controversy is being revived: the mystery of unidentified flying objects (UFOS)-commonly called flying saucers or discs. (Continued on Back Page) 
U.S. Air Force, are listed as having 'made a careful study of several thousand reports of unidentified objects. Only a few have been explained.' Earlier releases of information have disclosed that of 8,000 such reports over the years, only 12 percent could be satisfactorily explained by U.S. Air Force investigation. The rest are listed as 'unknown.' So, despite all the official denials, the reports keep coming in, the details to be explained.
We are told, too, that the Air Force has more than 10,000 reports of 'unknown' aerial objects on file. So there is obviously a mystery. What is it? This photograph was selected from among a series of shots credited to
Portiner A. Villa, who reports he took them near Albuquerque, New Mexico, some time in 1963.
Across California Sky," a few months later, I noticed an article entitled "Mystery Planet Hovers Over Albuquerque, New Mexico." It stated that on the same night as this photograph was taken, a mysterious object, estimated to be hundreds of feet in diameter, hovered for more than an hour over a spot near Albuquerque, New Mexico-the same general area as the location of the photograph.
The article stated further that the object gave off a pulsating, multicolored light, and that three local police officers and the New Mexico State Police observed the object as it hovered motionless for more than an hour, then shot away at fantastic speed.
The article continued to state that the Air Force denied any knowledge of the incident, and that the object has not been satisfactorily explained.
So, despite the Air Force denials, the UFO mystery is still very much alive. What is the answer? Are there really 'strange light floats' out there, as the old-timers say? Or are all these reports the result of over-active imaginations, or simply mistakes in the identification of known objects? There is still no definitive answer.
Perhaps, as the space age progresses, the mystery of the UFOs will be solved. But so far it remains one of the great unsolved enigmas of the 20th century.
All in all, there are over 100 civilian UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT sightings on record in the U.S. alone each year. The Air Force's own Project Blue Book has a working hand in hand with the International UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT Study Group of California [since] 1950. The two organizations together publish an official publication, "The Condon Report on UFOs," is published in detail.
But in all, the mystery still remains "Unso!"

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER FOR MAY 25, 1963

SUMMER STARS BEGIN TO APPEAR 
By JAMES STOKLEY

THE SUMMER STARS are beginning to show in the evening skies in the northern hemisphere. Mars, the only planet visible at this season, will grow more brilliant as the weeks pass.

The stars of summer, such as the bright blue-white Vega, the equally brilliant blue-white Altair, and the orange-red Antares, are starting to take their places in the evening skies which already are beginning to show the summer constellations. 

As the season advances, these constellations will become more prominent, while those of winter will fade from view. Saturn, for example, is now setting earlier each evening, and will soon disappear entirely from the night skies.

The chart accompanying this article shows the positions of some of the more prominent stars and constellations at about 1 a.m. local time in the middle of June (or 10 p.m. daylight saving time), a time when the summer skies are fully developed.

Scorpius Partially Visible

In the southern part of the evening sky, the brilliant constellation of Scorpius, the Scorpion, is becoming visible. Not all of the constellation is visible at the north, but the parts which are brilliant appear at that time.

This includes the brightest star, Antares, which is a red supergiant star that would appear even more brilliant if it were closer to us. But it is distant, and its great luminosity is lessened by the great distance.

As noted above, Mars passes close to the west of Antares during the month of June, and they will be so close together that they can be readily seen with the unaided eye. This event is one of the few occasions when the two planets may be easily compared, since Mars is so far north of the celestial equator that it is never very close to the region of the sky where the planets normally appear.

Here is the text from the document:

Dear Sir:

I would like to tell you of an experience which is rather interesting. On the night of June 4, 1963 at about 10:00 pm, as I was in my back yard, I saw a light silver, or a light aluminum color object which seemed to be about 25 or 35 feet in diameter. It was descending at about a 35 degree angle and moving at an estimated speed of about 35 mph. As it approached from the N.E. it described a semi-circular course and disappeared behind some trees. It was descending at too extreme of an angle as it approached from the N.E. to disappearance.

I tried not to get excited for it would not cause a commotion. I like to keep things like this to myself. My wife doesn't know about it and I don't want to tell her anything. I was just sitting there in my living room when I noticed something in the sky. Then it suddenly changed direction towards me. It came to within 100 to 150 feet above the plant, 200 to above the ground. It stayed there about 30 minutes. The object itself was round, like a puff of smoke, and was soundless. I'm not the type who sees a flying saucer and calls it a flying saucer. I would like to know your opinion on what you think or saw was witnessed. Your name can be given.

Sincerely Yours,

Mr. Wm. S. Grysik, UFO Researcher, made a call to IARA member. 
Mr. Grysik stated that on June 20, 1963, at about 9:50 P.M., he and his wife spotted a UFO at about 1000 ft. altitude. The object appeared to be a balloon or a small aircraft. However, Mr. Grysik suggested that it could have been a high flying plane, but he is puzzled by the strange appearance.

HONG KONG

Over the Peak
From The South China Sunday News.
Passed near the Peak and there was
an unusual and unaircraflike object flying over Hong Kong yesterday.
The object was seen by hundreds
of people on the Peak, and was apparently on a winding course, now
ascending, now descending and whe-
ling in the air. While passing over
the island, it changed colour several
times. It was described as being
bright, shining and sometimes brilliant. At times it seemed to be pulsating.
The object was, according to witnesses, of very considerable size, and
being over a thickly populated area,
caused much interest and amazement among the residents. It was
in sight for about 15 minutes.
Reported by residents on and near the Peak.

Search For UFO
In Minnesota

On the 4th of June 1963, Sheriff Dwyle Lindsay-Smith of Polk County, Minn., with two deputies, Howard Hough and Don Mieialis, KWAM radio reporter, were dispatched in three separate vehicles to investigate a strange multi-colored light which had been reported in the vicinity of Lyle, Minnesota short by after 8 p.m. that evening.

The deputies and the radio reporter chased the strange light which resembled a truck driver as it darted in and out of different vehicles on a rural road near Lyle. Several automobiles in the area also reported seeing a strange multi-colored light which appeared to settle momentarily on some trees near the Iowa border.

Highway patrolman Vernon Nefstead reported in a radio message that while chasing the object at a high rate of speed the light seemed to be guiding them and keeping a fixed distance between the patrol car and the object. When they stopped chasing it, it speeded up and went out of sight. The object was not found later in the vicinity of Lyle but found nothing unusual. Police at Albert Lea, Independence, Cedar Falls and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said they had received similar reports of a strange light in the sky that evening.

An Austin radio station said that after it had broadcast news of the incident, the station received calls from numerous individuals who said they had seen a multicolored light that seemed to descend and ascend in the Lyle area. The aerial phenomenon was also reported by residents of Conger, Hollandale and beyond as far as Brownsdale, Minn.

Wooded areas which would offer concealment were closely scanned.

The sighting occurred in England and was observed by 7 people. The object was described as a saucer-like object with a central dome and there was a bright light emanating from underneath. It was initially observed at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet and then descended to an estimated altitude of 500 feet where it hovered briefly before accelerating and disappearing rapidly. The witnesses described the object as being larger than a large aircraft and having a metallic appearance. Some strange effects were reported, such as a brief disturbance in radio reception, but no other details are provided.

The object's speed of approximately 800-900 MPH was estimated by the angle of elevation first seen over the trees was approximately 20 degrees elevation. It was lost behind the trees, then reappeared again at approximately 20 degrees elevation and almost directly toward them in an impossible and almost straight line path southward. He other lights were several, they seemed to show circles and other lights below the sighting, and estimated the altitude about 4 tenths at 4,500' and 4 tenths thin cirrus. Both boys reported only one sighting of this time (2 1/2 tenths or less) and that the object certainly was much higher than 4,500' and a reddish/orange in color.

Concordia, Argentina

Manuel Peron, member Concordia, Argentina Chamber of Deputies, informed us that a spherical object was detected over the city of Concordia on June 8, 1963. According to the report, the object was observed by several witnesses for more than 3 hours. The object was described as a silvery-bronze color, of unusual shape, and seemed to be the product of an advanced technology. It has no apparent propulsion system and demonstrated smooth, noiseless maneuverability, apparently defying the laws of gravity. This case is suggesting that it is experienced very high temperatures before falling to the ground.

'Tailed With Occupants'

Man Here Claims He
Saw Saucers 5 Times
By DWAYNE RARIDON

I don't know why they picked me,' said Remigio Lucero, 33, of Albuquerque. in speaking of what he claims were five flying saucer sightings.

Lucero said there was a purple-colored object about 30 to 40 feet in diameter that seemed to hover about 30 feet above the ground. He said it was round, silent, and without any apparent means of propulsion or mechanical support. 
Lucero said he saw the object 5 times in about five and a half hours, the last time at 2:30 a.m.
'Twice, he has talked to their occupants,' he says. He said the occupants were four to five feet tall with a yellowish complexion and eyes that were larger than normal. He said they seemed to want to communicate but failed to so, so he said he left the place.
With a roll of film if Villa claims to have taken pictures of the saucers but this film has never been developed.
Lucero, who lives with his mother-in-law and his wife and 3 children, said that when he first saw the object, his daughter-in-law, Louella, saw it too and that his wife and children also saw the object at another time.
Lucero said the occupants seemed interested in earthly things, especially in a truck, a jeep, and a car that were parked near the scene. He said they seemed to be studying, or trying to understand, these machines.
He says the rest was that there were no markings on the object and that it was able to make 'incredible turns and maneuvers in the air.'
'The occupants appeared to be studying us, just as we study animals,' Lucero said. 'But they were superior to us in all respects.'
He said he believes the saucers may have been on a scientific mission, perhaps to observe the earth's atmosphere and conditions on the surface.
Lucero said he had the impression the saucers were from another planet and that he believes they are a real phenomenon, not a figment of his imagination.
But he says he doesn't know whether they were manned by humans or by some other intelligent beings.
Lucero stated there was a feeling of uneasiness and fear when the object was nearby. He said he was afraid to approach the object, partly because he didn't know what the reaction of the occupants might be.
This, he said, was the main reason he hadn't tried to get closer to the object or to communicate with the occupants.
Lucero said he reported the sightings to officials but that they didn't seem very interested, although they did interview him. He said he believes the officials feel that people who report such things are not reliable."

Cigar-shaped object
over Taupo

The following report of an unusual sighting of an unidentified object over Taupo, New Zealand was carried in the Flying Saucer Review. Two independent observers in the area reported seeing the object on consecutive evenings over the same area. In both cases the object was described as cigar-shaped and in the first case it was said to leave a vapor trail much like the one left by a jet plane. One of the observers, a retired insurance man, reported that he watched the object for some time as it moved across the sky and passed over some commercial planes or jets in the area at the time.

Several weeks earlier on June 13, a North Dalles woman who declines to be identified, spotted the same or a similar object, which she reported on June 5.  The yellow-white light, she said, seemed to be plunging into the ocean off Seattle, but judging from its direction, it was doubtful back on its original course.  A few weeks later, on June 15 or 16, a Dalles woman reported she watched the same or a similar object hovering erratically for a few seconds.  This sighting was also reported in the Dalles press.  In all, 21 sightings have been reported to them.  All seemed to be the same or a similar object, sighted within days or at most 3 weeks of the Pettifor sightings.

NZ Youth Encounters UFO
The following is an account of an encounter between a youth and what appears to be a UFO, as reported in North City, New Zealand on June 18, 1962. From where he was situated in the garden, he noticed two bright lights in the sky coming directly toward him from the southwest. After about a minute they slowed down and were hovering about 250 yards away. After 5 seconds had passed, the lights suddenly moved off at a terrific speed. Their color was described as being pure white. No other witnesses were found and the local officials received no other UFO reports for that night.

Dear sir, 
On an about the night of June 12, 1969, I was out in my yard between approximately 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. when I noticed a very bright light in the northern part of the sky. The light was quite brilliant and seemed to be closer, larger and more clear than the stars in the sky. The object was oval shaped and appeared to be moving rapidly from west to east. I called my neighbor and several other neighbors also witnessed the object. We watched it for approximately 2 to 3 minutes as it moved across the sky. The object appeared to be glowing with a greenish blue color. It did not have any visible wings, tail or exhaust and made no sound. After a brief interval of being obscured by some trees, the object then appeared to suddenly accelerate and disappear from view. I have excellent eye sight and am an amateur astronomer myself. This object was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. I feel certain that what I and my neighbors saw was a UFO, and I would appreciate any information you may be able to provide regarding this incident.
Sincerely,

Last night a witness was traveling along a main road near Albuquerque. New Mexico when he observed a bright light in the sky. The light appeared very close and seemed to be moving up and down, as well as hovering at times. The witness described the object as being shaped like an elongated football, and estimated that it was about 50 feet in length. He stated that the object emitted a bright glow and made no sound. He watched the object for approximately 30 minutes before it suddenly disappeared. The witness could not determine how the object disappeared, but stated that it did not simply fly away. The witness also reported that the object appeared to be under intelligent control, and that it made abrupt changes in direction and speed during the sighting. The witness expressed that he was very disturbed by the experience and could offer no explanation for what he had observed.

2 December 1964
Rochester, New York
Dear Bill:
I've taken a long while to return your pictures, which I am doing now. I am a little surprised that you considered that what had been reported as Leonard de Vinci type objects were of such interest. Long time ago - in files in this office - I had material from a few people who claimed they had photographed some peculiar objects in the sky, but when the photographs were closely examined here, they turned out to be due to normal conditions, such as balloons, aircraft reflections, and the like. So it seemed unlikely that anyone photographing a UFO would have anything very remarkable. (For comments, unlikely to be valid, show this statement.)
But the photographs at Wright Field have come up with a story telling blow.
In critically examining1964 photographs made 28 August 1964, they seem to show remarkable objects. They are large, about the size of a house, and quite different from any aircraft known to be in that area at that time. It seems unlikely that anyone photographing a UFO would have anything very remarkable. (For comments, unlikely to be valid, show this statement.)
1) I have taken the liberty of having prints made from the negatives, which is the usual Branch on the left side of the print, passing behind the object and in good align ment with the shadows. 3t is never seen behind the object. Therefore, the object is between us and the Branch. On the right, which are further away. Therefore, the object is between us and the Branch, and is not attached to
it.
2) In photographs one and two the object appears to be at sharper image than the trees and blue green. This indicates the UFO is between the camera and the trees and nearer to the camera.
(If comments this is not the same objection as the Leonardo da Vinci case and is
one thing, this is not a matter of depth of
In short, I would not best even contemplate money on these pictures buying any validity.
The reason is that they show too remarkable. This is monstrously modern and
spooky. It is just as remarkable as any. I therefore conclude that these photographs are in some kinds. This is what makes our job at the Air Force harder these days. People are affected unduly by such stories, and it would take a lot of digging to get such a signal out.
but Cases when you see this. And ends very I hope your pictures so long.
