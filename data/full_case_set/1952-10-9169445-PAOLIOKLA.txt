Terrin Air Force Base, Tex.
(1) The one object sighted was round, bright-bluish in color; it was traveling from the southwest to the northeast at an estimated speed of 3,000 to 3,500 George V. Wafts, to be 600 miles per hour; it passed by one of the sources, George V. Wafts, to the east. There was no distinguishable exhaust but a bright glow. The object burst into fragments and simultaneously disappeared.
(2) Object was sighted at approximately 0035 hours, 29 October 1952. Length of time observed was about ten seconds.
(3) Observation was made visually from a C-47 type aircraft, altitude 5,500 feet.
(4) Location of observers was 35° 37'N, 97° 19'W, over the Canadian River, 5 1/2 miles east of the "Drumum Cave" airfield. The object was at 9,000 feet altitude and traveling east to west, straight line along, one of the crew members of the C-47 aircraft.
(5) All these observers have not previously experienced the sighting of unidentified flying objects. The two officers have responsible positions in a flying training group, Perrin Air Force Base.
(6) Weather at the time and place of sighting was fair. Visibility was good without any wind from the northeast.
(7) There was no known condition, meteorological or otherwise, which could have accounted for the sighting.
(8) There is no known existence of evidence such as fragments, photographs, etc., of the sighting.
(9) This case was reported to Oklahoma City radio station KOMA of the incident and also reported it to Range Control Oklahoma City. This base then notified Carswell Air Force Base, Texas, which did not recognize the C-47 aircraft.
(10) No air traffic was observed in the area at the time of the sighting.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document with a heading "SECURITY INFORMATION" and a sketch or diagram labeled "SKETCH". The document seems to be describing an observation or encounter related to a "UFO" or unidentified flying object. The text discusses details such as the altitude, speed, and appearance of the object observed.

OCR OUTPUT:

On the night of Tuesday, 28 October 1952, I was pilot of an Air Force F-51. I was on a routine night training mission at approximately 10,000 feet MSL. Over Paoli, Oklahoma, I observed a bright light which appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, estimated at 1,750 hours, or approximately 23 hours after sunset. The light descended rapidly and was observed for a period of approximately 15 minutes. The object appeared to be oval or cigar-shaped, estimated to be 1,000 to 1,500 feet in altitude. 
According to my knowledge, I reported the following observations to be true and correct: 
1. The object was traveling at a high rate of speed. 
2. The object descended rapidly.
3. The object was oval or cigar-shaped. 
4. The altitude of object was 1,000 to 1,500 feet.
5. The object appeared to illuminate the ground area in the vicinity of the object.
The object descended into numerous bright fragments. I do not believe this was an astronomical phenomena, but an unknown aerial object that appeared over the Paoli, Oklahoma, area.

SKETCH: View from Interior of C-47 Aircraft

I, 2/Lt George W. Watson to the best of my knowledge state these facts that follow to be true:

On the morning of 26 October 1952, I was flying in a C-47 (DC3) type aircraft with Capt. JACK F. McKNIGHT and 2Lt ROY H. HALE. We were watching for aircraft and as we looked out of the rear cargo door, which was open, we noticed a large disc-like aircraft glowing with a reddish glow and moving at a very high rate of speed. This craft passed under our aircraft and disappeared into clouds to the south. We were up at an altitude of 7600 feet, speed between 2,300 and 2,500 feet per minute, and this large craft passed under us in about 5 seconds.
