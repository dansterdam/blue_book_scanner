14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
At the end of observetion, it just faded away.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One): Yes - No - Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.
It moved behind, blocks

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

Indicate any additional information about yourself, including any special experience, which might be pertinent.
Born in Florida, had many strange encounters with unusual objects in the sky in the area where I live. Over the years I have witnessed several strange objects which I have never been able to identify or explain. The objects I have seen have been moving at very high speeds, changing directions abruptly, appearing and disappearing. Some of the objects seemed to be intelligently controlled, but I cannot say for certain what they were. I have reported some of these sightings to the authorities over the years, but nothing ever came of it.

33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object? Reported this sighting to the Air Force Base at Jacksonville, FLa. about 4 or 5 days after I saw it.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:    Day    Month    Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

(I talked this over to my wife, and she felt that I picked up my location around Boca Raton with a story, because to the best of our knowledge there are no large groupings of silver lights or starlike objects known to hover or move in the area. I picked up my location around Boca Raton with a story, because to the best of our knowledge there are no large groupings of silver lights or starlike objects known to hover or move in the area. I could not determine definitely an exact location where this object or objects was first observed. They were sighted first in a straight line north to south and later in a zig-zag fashion between ground and horizon. The objects seemed between 20 to 30 feet in diameter, were bright silver in color with a metallic appearance, and seemed to give off a soft white light glow. There were no other physical characteristics noted, such as wings, propulsion, or any structural details that could be discerned. The nearest object seemed to be at about 1,000 feet in altitude, and the farthest about 5,000 feet. The objects were observed for approximately 30 minutes and showed no apparent evidence of sound. At no time was any attempt made to communicate with or signal the objects. If this were something natural, I would have expected to be able to determine the exact location, whereas I could not. These objects did not seem to conform to any known aircraft or other natural phenomena. There was no evidence of any physical effects on the environment, such as radio or TV interference, animal disturbance, or any other effects noted. Based upon my experience, I would conclude that the objects observed were not of any natural or conventional aircraft origin, and represented a genuine unidentified flying object. I made no attempt to obtain photographs or other physical evidence, as I did not have the necessary equipment with me at the time. If this were something natural, I would have expected to be able to determine the exact location, whereas I could not. These objects did not seem to conform to any known aircraft or other natural phenomena.)

I was called at home about 4:45 am. It was a bright clear night with stars showing so that I could see a large, dark object silhouetted against the sky. It was hovering, absolutely motionless, about 1000 feet off the ground and about a half mile away. The object appeared to be about 40-50 feet in diameter and shaped like a typical flying saucer. As I watched, a bright beam of light shot from the object down to the ground, illuminating a large area. The beam seemed to pulsate or flicker as it remained stationary on the ground for about 30 seconds. Then the light went out and the object shot straight up at a fantastic speed, disappearing into the night sky within seconds. I turned on the portable radio transmitter I had with me and called the base. After about 15 minutes, a car arrived to pick me up. I was taken to the base and thoroughly questioned about what I had seen. I could give them no further information other than what I have described here. This was the most astounding and impressive sight I have ever witnessed. I am quite certain that what I saw was not a natural phenomenon and could only have been an intelligently controlled device of some kind. I have a technical background and I am quite familiar with all types of aircraft and aerospace hardware. Whatever this object was, it was not something built by any nation on earth that I know of.

Contact was made with Mr. [REDACTED] of the Goodyear Company, concerning the location of the Goodyear blimp during the early part of my 67. It was found that the blimp, Mr. Hilliard, did not fly on 7 May 67, thus could not have been responsible for the sighting.
