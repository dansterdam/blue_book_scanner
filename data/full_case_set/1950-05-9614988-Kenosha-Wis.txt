May 17 - 1950
Sighted at 10,000 to 15,000 ft, a slightly shining light, that moved in a direct line from north to south. I live in Kenosha Wis., on the 39' 31' west and 88' 15' long. It was sighted approximately by a friend and me. The weather was slightly cloudy, very slight wind from a 3 to 4 mi. per hour. wind coming from the north east. A connection. This light stopped on the southeast horizon and then started moving in a south easterly direction. It moved slowly and after a few seconds continued on its way until it disappeared from sight. There wasn't any other form behind it than the sighting was on May 17 nightlighters. Age is 13.
Tell what was it. Please don't use my name as I am curious to know of the strange phenomena and I am not inclined the publicity. Please also not reply.
