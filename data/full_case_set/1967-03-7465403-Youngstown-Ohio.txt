March 7, 1967
YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO
At approximately 6:40 pm the informant, who wishes to remain anonymous, was driving alone west on Route 82, about 2 miles east of Youngstown, Ohio. The weather was cloudy with occasional rain showers. As he drove he noticed a bright object in the sky, just ahead and to the right of his vehicle. At first he thought it was an aircraft, but as he continued to observe it, he realized that it was definitely not an airplane. It appeared to be a circular, disc-shaped object, hovering and drifting slowly to the north. It had a greenish-blue glow, and appeared to be about 2-3 feet in diameter. The object disappeared from view after about 2-3 minutes.
The informant immediately pulled over to the side of the road and attempted to get a better look at the object, but it had already moved out of sight. He did not hear any unusual sounds associated with the object.
The informant is a 27-year-old white male, employed as a salesman. He has had no previous UFO sightings and considers himself to be a rational, level-headed individual. He immediately reported the incident to the local police department.
