Receipt of UFOB report from RAM Ops at 03002
Type of craft: T-23A
Serial no: 1717893
Time of sighting: 0015Z
Place: 18 miles north of HUT
Alt: 6,000 ft 
Heading: 010 degrees
Speed: 150kts
Weather conditions: Soft haze in a clear sky with haze above them
The pilot comments: 
It was a green light roundish in shape hazy looking probably due to the haze above them. Was seen descending dead ahead on me, heading 010 degrees. 75 degrees to the ground. Was seen thru the sky looking about 30 degrees and down. The object descended quite rapidly, coming down from right to left. The total time of sighting lasted less than (1) second. It also could have looked like a commercial search light it was so bright around the edges but were they were very narrow.
Pilots name: CAPT. KENNETH P. BROOKS AG, DS OGGC, 5352 SCHOOL
Chetwits A.F.B., Illinois
there was a co-pilot and he also sighted the object but was unable to talk to him because he had already left due to a test he had to take early in the morning. Capt. K. B. Brooks stated he would contact him at home and have him leave his pilot information at the dispatcher desk
