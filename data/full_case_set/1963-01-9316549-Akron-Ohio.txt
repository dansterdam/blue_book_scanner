The object was in view for 20 to 25 minutes, and the time of the sighting was 6:00 PM. The object was motionless, had dull yellow lights, faded on and off, and was surrounded by a ring of bright lights. The object moved slowly to the southeast and was fairly close.

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
9 JANUARY 1963
RAVENNA, OHIO

The text in the document reads as follows:

RAVENNA - ROUSTOWN - Jan. 9, 1963 - 6:10 PM. Mr. Rice and two other observers were witness to a strange event in local skies... Their attention was drawn to a very bright light source almost directly overhead. As they watched, the light source described it as round. After ten (10) minutes the object split into three (3) parts; all three parts proceeded southward and disappeared. The object was like that of an auto headlight. The object was either very low or tremendous in size if this in fact was an estimate made at Arama Heights. (From KLYN's UFO program)

There does not appear to be a photograph in this image. The provided text is an incident report from Project Blue Book describing the sighting of strips of tin foil scattered over a wide area of farm land. The report details the witness's observations and actions taken, including contacting the proper authorities. I will now proceed to transcribe the text found in the document:

At 2015 Mr. ***** called to report the following:
While out hunting he noticed small strips of tin foil scattered over a wide area of farm land. He was curious at the time, but did not collect any samples of the material. He became more curious and concerned when he read that British bombers had penetrated our air defenses, and thought that perhaps the foil strips were some type of British radar jamming material. He contacted the CAP who suggested that he collect some samples and notify FTD.
Mr. ***** returned to the scene, but a recent snow fall had concealed the foil for the time being. He said that it is starting to thaw now and he should be able to find some samples in the next day or two.
Mr. ***** a machinist, described the strips as being about 1/4 to 5/16 in. wide and 2 3/4 to 3 in. long.
Thanked him for his report and advised him that report would be delivered to appropriate branch of FTD for action.
