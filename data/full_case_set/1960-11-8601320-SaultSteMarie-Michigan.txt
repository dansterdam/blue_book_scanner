5. COURSE OF OBJECT Long Range, From North to South
6. NUMBER OF OBJECTS Lone
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION 3 Minutes
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Called to window to observe large ovoid shaped obj. flying at high alt. from north to south. Obj. appeared steady, grey-white color, without observable shape or structure. About 1 degree apparent diameter. Silently flew almost due south on straight course. After 3 minutes, obj. passed out of sight. Obj. appeared luminous internally, giving off no trail or exhaust.
11. COMMENTS. Speed too fast for jet. Size, speed, and maneuverability not consistent with known aircraft. No known natural phenomena can account for visual observations made. This is one of best sightings in this area involving reliable witnesses. Object was tracked on radar by Sault Ste.Marie Air Force Station but was not intercepted. Determination of exact speed, altitude, and size not possible from this observation alone, but all indications are that this was an unconventional flying object of unknown origin. Sighting duration of 3 minutes, observed path and speed, and radar tracking all consistent with each other. This sighting deserves further investigation.

THIS OBJECT WAS SEEN BY TWO PERSONS AT THE SAME TIME (ONLY
ONE INTERVIEWED) THE INITIAL REPORT WAS CALLED IN ONLY A FEW
MINUTES AFTER THE SIGHTING TOOK PLACE, THE DELAY IN COMPILING
THIS REPORT IS DUE TO A MIX-UP IN OBSERVER'S PHONE NUMBER AND I.D.
LIABIIITY OF THIS OFFICER TO REACH SITE AND DETERMINE THE INITIAL CALL-IN
DETAIL MAY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED DUE TO ATTEMPT TO WATCH HICK'S  IT IS

QUESTIONED THE OBSERVER AT LENGTH AND HIS ANSWERS WERE ALL CLEAR

IF THE WEATHER BALLOON LAUNCHED AT LISHAME ND WAS STILL AIRBORNE
AT 22:32 24 NOV 60 WHICH IS 23:32 AFTER THE LAUNCHING TOOK PLACE
IT SEEM LIKELY THAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN WHAT THE OBSERVER SIGHTED.  
THE -76 -,/-CTION AND APPARENT STOPPING COULD HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED
TO CHA.-.7E EFFECT OF A TEMPERATURE INVERSION CAUSING THE OPTICAL

DECLASSIFIED 
KR. H. G. SAWYER, AT.G., MICH 

OBSERVATIONS-- I saw and identified as a large white light in the sky which was moving in a downward direction at a high rate of speed. The light was observed for approximately 15-20 seconds and disappeared from view. The object was first observed at approximately 1845 hours and was in view for approximately 15-20 seconds. NO SOUND WAS HEARD. The object was observed to be descending at a high rate of speed. IT APPEARED TO BE SILVERY-WHITE IN COLOR AND SEEMED TO BE OVAL IN SHAPE. IT COVERED A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 30-40 DEGREES IN THE SKY. THERE WERE NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY AND THE VISIBILITY WAS GOOD. I HAVE BEEN OBSERVING AND CHECKING THIS TYPE OF PHENOMENA FOR SOME TIME AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT WHAT I SAW WAS NOT A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. IT WAS MOVING TOO FAST AND DESCENDING TOO RAPIDLY TO BE A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. I WOULD APPRECIATE FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT.
