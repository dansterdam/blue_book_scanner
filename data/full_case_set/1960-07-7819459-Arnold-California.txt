APR 2 /1960 FIR 39/7282/3 AUG 60

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

There is no authenticated evidence that any of the numerous unidentified flying objects (UFOs) which have been reported actually represent vehicles or devices of extraterrestrial origin. The so-called "sightings" of such objects are either the result of misinterpretations of known or natural phenomena, or they are hoaxes. There is no direct physical threat to the security of the country from these objects, as they have not shown hostile or aggressive action. Nor have they interfered with the activities of the U.S. Air Force or other military units, which maintain constant vigilance for the defense of the nation. The public, the press or Congress should avoid speculation or controversy, as this leads to unwarranted alarm and public confusion.  

If an act of Congress, the United States Air Force is charged with the duty of investigating the validity of reports of unidentified flying objects. In connection with this vital and important mission, the Air Force must investigate, to the best of its ability, any reports or sightings that are made by responsible persons or agencies. Since the whole matter is a complex one, involving the interests of national security, individual privacy, and the advancement of scientific knowledge, the Air Force must necessarily be selective and guarded in the information it releases.

There is no intention, whatsoever, to conceal information from the public. But there are limitations and difficulties involved in this type of investigation which make complete and immediate disclosure impractical. The obvious aim is to arrive at the truth, whatever that may be, and to make it known to the proper authorities. The implications of the existence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe are so profound that such a discovery, if made, would unquestionably be announced. But the present state of our knowledge does not warrant such a momentous conclusion. Speculation along these lines should be avoided, as it tends to create more confusion than understanding.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output:

...TEST is the incident Richard L. Arnold ( continued) The document describes a sighting that occurred on 21 July 1952, as the Air Force 10.5 report. 
The sighting occurred on 21 July 1952, as reported by Maj. Gen. Albert M. Guidera, Commanding the 4th Air Division, Hamilton Air Force Base, California. He said that on 21 July 1952, he received a report of strange lights in the sky over Mount Rainier, Washington. He immediately dispatched an F-94 jet interceptor to investigate. The pilot made visual contact with the lights, which appeared to be a formation of 5-6 objects, bright reddish-orange in color, and estimated to be about 2500 feet above the ground. The objects were manuvering in a definite formation at an estimated speed of 600 m.p.h.
The pilot fired his jet's afterburners in an effort to close in on the objects, but as he approached them, they suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. The pilot reported that he was not able to get a closer look as the objects moved away from him at a very high rate of speed. 
Since this incident was reported through normal intelligence channels and considered a high priority at the time, it was never brought to the attention of Project Blue Book. If I may be of further assistance, please let me know.

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

FILE: 1955
ROLAND/DJS/73276/JDH
4 AUG 1960

Dear : In response to your letter of 24 June 1960 requesting information on unidentified flying objects, the following information is provided.

The Air Force position on UFO's is stated in Assistant Secretary of the Air Force Memorandum to the Secretary of the Air Force, dated 20 September 1951, a copy of which is attached. There is no authenticated evidence to prove the existence of Interplanetary spaceships. The Air Force will investigate any reports from reliable sources and maintain a continuous review of the subject. However, the Air Force cannot assume responsibility for investigating reports from individual citizens.

Article from the working air information service of 16 August 1960, subject: Evaluation of Unidentified Flying Objects Sightings, is attached which covers the policy in this matter. If the reports submitted appear to have sufficient merit, they are investigated to the extent necessary to establish identifiability and to avoid duplication.

"Per your further information and reference, I am positive you meant very sincerely what you said. That kind of sincerity will get positive results.

The report is unsatisfactory filed to indicate a careful examination and analysis of all pertinent data on the part of the reporting officer. It lacks the usual complete details, descriptions and diagrams and other data needed for a thorough and complete analysis. Pertinent details and data which are missing and should be obtained are as follows:

"size, shape, color, metallic, luminosity, objects and other details", "flying maneuvers, tops speeds" by "flying sources", "other comments" by "[REDACTED]"

Definitive statements are lacking to indicate whether or not the sighting constitutes an astronomical, meteorological or other natural phenomenon and, if not, what possible man-made or other explanation there may be. The report is therefore lacking in the information and detail needed to determine the nature of the sighting.

An investigation by a qualified and disinterested Field Investigator, supported by documentary evidence, photographs, diagrams, and the usual complete details, is therefore requested in this particular case in order to obtain the essential information and data needed for a thorough and definitive analysis."

On July 12, 1947, about 3:00 pm, at a place near Mount Rainier, Washington, Mr. Kenneth Arnold, a business man of Boise, Idaho, reported that he saw a formation of nine shiny objects flying at a high rate of speed. He described them as being shaped like saucers and estimated that they were about 40-50 feet in diameter. He stated that they flew in a diagonal, chain-like line and that they appeared to weave in and out of the high rock peaks of the mountain. He estimated their speed to be between 1200 and 1700 miles per hour. Their flight path was from Mount Rainier to Mount Adams. Mr. Arnold stated that he had never seen anything like it before and could not offer an explanation as to what they were. This was one of the earliest and most publicized sightings of unidentified flying objects in the United States.

"So Case (Information Only)
23 July 1950
Kennebunk, Me., Maine

Source: UFO Investigator, 1957-1958 1980

The source of this information is from a report by John C. F. Brown, Jr., a business man and inventor, concerning a UFO sighting which occurred on 23 July 1950 at Kennebunk, Maine. This report was forwarded to the Air Force and received by Project Blue Book in 1950. The report stated that at 10:30 P.M., 23 July 1950, the witness and his wife saw a bright, glowing, circular object in the sky at an altitude of approximately 3,000 feet. The object was approximately 100 to 150 feet in diameter, and consisted of a bright glowing whitish light. It made no sound and was observed for about 30 seconds before it disappeared. The report concluded that the object was definitely not an airplane or any other conventional aircraft."

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
25 JULY 1960 
ATLANTA, GEORGIA

Extract from Letter to the Honorable Richard B. Russell 
With specific reference to your inquiry concerning the alleged UFO which fell at Atlanta, Georgia, inquiry reveals that, on 25 July 1960, at 6:00 P.M., a practice bomb fell from the skies and landed on the grounds of the Atlanta Federal Prison Farm. No injuries or damages to property were incurred other than a hole in the ground which was 11 inches in diameter. The incident was investigated by Explosive Ordnance Disposal Detachment from Fort McPherson, Dobbins and Robbins Air Force Bases, Georgia. Fragments of the bomb were recovered which contained stock numbers and a manufacturer's name and which were identified as being part of an MA-1 Spotting Charge. The investigation further revealed that fragments from the bomb extend 25 feet to the bottom of the hole and recovered an MA-1 Practice Bomb.

Since this incident was reported through Explosive Ordnance Disposal, it appeared rather than through UFO channels. It was never considered a UFO and no UFO report, as such, was ever rendered.
