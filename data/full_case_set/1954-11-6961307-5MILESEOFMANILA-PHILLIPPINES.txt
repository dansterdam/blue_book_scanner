APO 323

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

BACKGROUND: On 6 November 1954, a report was received from the Operations Officer 5th Air Force, Far East Air Force, concerning an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) sighting in the Philippines.

DETAILS: On 5 November 1954, at approximately 1915 hours local time, an officer and enlisted man assigned to the 3rd Radar Plotting and Control Unit, located approximately 5 miles southeast of Manila, Philippines, observed an unidentified object in the sky. The object was first observed at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet and was moving in a northeasterly direction at a speed estimated to be between 300 and 500 knots.
The object was generally circular in shape and varied in size, appearing to expand and contract. The color of the object changed from white to orange and back to white again during the observation. The object was observed for approximately 5 to 7 minutes before it disappeared from sight.

COMMENTS: This case is being forwarded to your headquarters for evaluation and analysis. Please furnish any information or conclusions which may result from your study of this report. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

The image appears to contain a technical drawing or diagram rather than a photograph. The drawing depicts a bright orange-colored object with a symmetrical, saucer-like shape. The text at the top of the image indicates this is a "Source impression of UFOs", suggesting this is a technical analysis or depiction of a reported unidentified flying object.
