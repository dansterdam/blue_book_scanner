There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document with text that appears to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

P.S. I am unable to see any human faces in this image, so I will not identify or name any individuals.

Text from the document:
We have had a few calls during the past week regarding strange sightings over the Brooklyn area. Most of these calls have been from people who work at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The sightings were made during the evening hours, usually between 7:00 P.M. and 10:00 P.M.
The witnesses reported seeing a bright light, or several bright lights, maneuvering in the sky. The lights were said to be hovering, moving rapidly, and making sudden changes in direction. Some of the witnesses also reported hearing a humming sound associated with the lights.
We have not been able to identify the cause of these sightings. There have been no reports of aircraft or other known objects in the area at the time of the sightings. We will continue to investigate this matter and will provide any additional information as it becomes available.

The shared image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document or report. The text in the document appears to be written in cursive and discusses details related to a UFO sighting or incident.

Text from the document:

There appears to be about 8 or 9 inches of clearance below the instrument 
panel and about 4 feet clearance in front of the instrument panel, seat and 
controls (controls). The cabin interior is observed to be totally vacant except for
a single seat/couch on the left side. The interior color appears to be of dull silver,
gray or metallic appearance. No observable windows or portholes are present.
The exterior shape and contour (observed when landing) appears to be circular 
with a dome-like upper section and a rather flat bottom section. The estimated size
would be approximately 30 feet in diameter. The color of the exterior when observed 
just prior to landing appeared to be dull silver or gray metallic.
