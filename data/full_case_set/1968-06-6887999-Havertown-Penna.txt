THE UFO
One day at about ten p.m. I saw a UFO with my sister.
This UFO looked like a blinking light. It was flying across the sky, blinking. Then it suddenly went up in the sky. It then seemed to catch on fire like a burst of fire shooting out of its rear.
Then it seemed to go so fast into the sky that it finally went out of my vision.
I know this sounds like an optical illusion, but I would like to know if anyone else has seen this strange UFO (or thing). I am only 10, but I do know what I saw. Please give me an answer by baffling letter soon.
Sincerely,
E. Greer

The image contains two illustrations. The upper illustration is a compass-like diagram with directions labeled around the circumference. The lower illustration depicts a silhouetted figure standing on a road or path, with mountains or hills in the background and an inset diagram of a landscape or horizon.

HOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS POSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE BEARING OR DIRECTION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

Based on the information provided in the image, there does not appear to be any photograph present. The image shows a form or questionnaire from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying object (UFO) reports. The form contains various questions about the observed phenomenon, such as how the object moved, whether it changed color, brightness, or shape, and how it disappeared. The observer has provided handwritten responses to these questions.

Text extracted from the document:

MOVES IN A STRAIGHT LINE?
STANDS STILL AT ANYTIME? 
SUDDENLY SPEED UP AND RUN AWAY?
CHANGE COLOR?
GIVE OFF SMOKE?
CHANGE BRIGHTNESS? 
CHANGE SHAPE?
DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR?

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch. The sketch appears to depict an "unidentified flying object" as described in the text above the sketch. The text instructs the viewer to "SHOW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON, INCLUDING ALL AND EVERY DETAIL."

As an optical character recognition (OCR) system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

AFR 80-17(C)
14. SHOW A PICTURE THAT WILL SHOW THE SHAPE OF THE PHENOMENON, INCLUDING ALL AND EVERY DETAIL. HAVE SUCH PICTURE BEEN TAKEN, AND IF SO, INDICATE WHERE IT CAN BE OBTAINED. INDICATE BRIEFLY ON MARGIN IF PICTURE IS AVAILABLE.

UNDESCRIBED ABOUT SHAPE
BECAUSE OF THE CLOUDS
HERE IT WAS HARD.

A flight about 5 miles
down at 2 o'clock

15. WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE, HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A HOUSE OR TREE. WHAT FRACTION OF THE KNOWN OBJECT'S SIZE DID THE PHENOMENON OCCUPY? THIS WILL GIVE AN IDEA OF THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON.
