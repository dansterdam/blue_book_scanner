THE OBSERVATORY
OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN
March 10, 1956

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

Cambridge 38, Massachusetts

Dear Allen:

Many thanks for your letter of March 4th, and you should by now have received a copy of my letter ta ______ covering the composition of the voting delegation. Of course, _________ name should appear in place of _________.

I am amused by the matter of the UFO report. It so happens that on the evening in question I was out looking for Sputnik II with a friend of mine who works for the government. We did not see the Sputnik, because it passed over earlier than the predicted time, but I was rather startled to observe a stellar-like object, which appeared in the northeast at an altitude of about 30Â° and moved very rapidly, in about three or four seconds, in a rather flat trajectory across the sky before it disappeared almost directly in the west. I commented that because of its speed and direction, the object could not be the Sputnik. I had also never seen a meteor with such a long path, at least considering its relatively low brightness of about the first magnitude. My friend insisted that it ought to be reported and hence I did. It probably was a meteor.

With best regards, I am
