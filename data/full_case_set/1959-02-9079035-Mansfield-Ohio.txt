The image appears to be a scanned document titled "DISPOSITION FORM" from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force project to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document contains a request for evaluation and interpretation of an enclosed color negative, black and white negative, and black and white picture.

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

1.  Enclosed with the black and white negative and print is an enlarged color print which was developed from the color negative. This color print shows shadows of the vapor trails which were omitted in cropping the black and white negative. There is no indication that the black and white version shows the sky in a vapor trail.
2.  The two dark streaks accompanying the vapor trail are not parallel to it. We do not have an explanation for the possible shadows of the vapor trail cast upon the ground, but since we were limited to just the one frame we were unable to form any opinion.

Dear Sirs,

At approximately 4:15 P.M., February 12, 1959, I glanced to glance out of my laboratory window and noticed a strange object in the sky. This object appeared to be two overhead flying under a cirrostratus type cloud approximately 5,000 feet above the ground. 

The important thing was that the three lines were parallel so I immediately studied it closer to my photograph but found that it was too far away to photograph properly. The inclined photographs should give you an idea of the situation.

This was the second time I have observed this type object. About an hour earlier, the same type of object was observed but did not remain in view as long as the one mentioned above.

I am sure the USAF researcher and will appreciate an explanation of the phenomena.

Sincerely,
[Signature Redacted]
