COMMENTS NUMEROUS CALLS WERE RECEIVED (APPROX 30) CONCERNING THIS OBJECT BY THE BASE OPERATIONS DUTY OFFICER. MAJOR RAYMOND D. RICE, THIS REPORT SUMMARIZES THE REPORTS RECEIVED. SOME OBSERVERS THOUGHT THAT THE OBJECT MIGHT BE A BALLOON WITH LIGHTS. WASHINGTON CENTER AND APPROACH CONTROL REPORTED NO RADAR TARGET WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE SPECIFIED TIME. GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER REPORTED NO AIRCRAFT AIRBORNE AT THE TIME. THE LATEST U.S. WEATHER BUREAU BALLOON LAUNCH WAS AT 2300 Z/IL29 CUT FROM STERLING, VA. THE BALLOON WAS NOT LIGHTED AND CAME APART AT 0100 Z/IL30 PREVAILING WINDS WOULD HAVE CARRIED THE BALLOON WELL TO THE EAST BEFORE 2300 Z/IL29.

PAST 4 RUES UA72599 UNCLAS
OLOB ZULU OBSERVERS FROM WASHINGTON NATIONAL TOWER AND ANDREWS AFB TOWER UNABLE TO SEE THE OBJECT. POSSIBLE CAUSE FROM OBSERVERS' ACCOUNTS INDICATE THAT THE OBJECT COULD HAVE BEEN A LIGHTED BALLOON FROM AN UNKNOWN AGENCY OR BY PERSON OR PERSONS TRYING TO PERPETRATE A HOAX.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Observations, Maryland, 22 Aug 67
At 0215, 22 Aug 67, Major Quintanilla spoke with Captain Jensen and Lt. Nielson of the Public Information Office, Andrews AFB, Maryland. 
Lt. Nielson had investigated the reports on this particular UFO. He said he had asked Lt. Nielson if he had checked with the police department on this sighting. He said he hadn't but he had heard that the police department had made observations of the UFO. Major Quintanilla explained that we also felt that the observation was a balloon but confirmations from someone (like the police department) is needed before we can release a statement to the public that it was a balloon. Lt. Nielson said he would check with the police department but he wasn't sure that he could get a confirmation.
Lt. Nielson commented that NICAP was on an NBC report. The NBC film report left no doubt that it was a balloon for evidently this person had observed one go up the night before. Major Quintanilla asked Lt. Nielson to call the lady in the documentary and find out where she had gotten her confirmation. Lt. Nielson didn't understand why she should not get a confirmation from her since the film left no doubt that it was a balloon. Major Quintanilla explained that we needed a confirmation before we can release a statement that the observation was a balloon.
Captain Jensen then asked what Major Quintanilla's job was and who he was connected with. Captain Jensen also wanted to know who was interested in this. Major Quintanilla informed him that it was Public at large that had had the inquiries and that we must give them a statement. Captain Jensen said they would try to get a confirmation.
Lt. Nielson said that the sky was overcast to 12,000 ft and the air was very still. Their extension is 4511.

At 0930, Major Quintanilla spoke with Mr. Jim Newton of Public Relations, SAFOI regarding this observation. Wanted to know if Public was still getting inquiries on this sighting. Public had gotten only two press inquiries, however Community relations had had several. Major Quintanilla informed Mr. Newton that he had spoken with Andrews and wanted them to get us a confirmation. Major Quintanilla also informed Mr. Newton of the statement that was given in a news report that the observation was a balloon, and that Andrews was checking this out. Mr. Newton said the only release that they gave out was that the case is currently under investigation.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD 
SUBJECT: UFO REPORTS, Wash D C area, 23 AUG 67
Lt Nielsen of Andrews AFB, Ohio spoke with a witness regarding additional information he had been able to gather on the sightings made in the Washington D C area on 22 August 67. Lt Nielsen checked with the D C police department and Ft Melington police department. They were negative, no enforcement observed a UFO nor did anyone turn in a balloon. Lt Nielsen also talked to a private citizen and he told Lt Nielsen that he was standing in downtown Georgetown and there was a policeman on the corner who was also watching this object. Lt Nielsen has been unable to get in touch with the policeman, however, he comes on duty at 1300 and he will try to reach him then.
Lt Nielsen also spoke with Lt Col Bunita who is with the Scientific and Technical Division of DIA. Lt Col Bunita said that based on everything he has seen and heard the object was most probably a surface balloon with some kind of light tied onto it.
I also asked Lt Nielsen if everyone reported that the color was red and he said yes.
Lt Nielsen said that he had previously checked National Airport, which would have been in the area, to see if any of their pilots had observed the UFO. However, Lt Nielsen said he could personally check each airline if one of their pilots had observed the UFO if Major Quintanilla would want him to do so. I informed Lt Nielsen that would call him back in approximately 24 hours.

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: WIO/LT Nielsen/4511

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 22 August 1967, Washington, D. C.

TO: TDETTO

1. Reference is made to the message sent from this Headquarters, 23 August 1967, concerning subject sighting.

2. An investigation conducted by the undersigned has failed to positively identify the object sighted over Washington, D.C. at 2220 hours (August) on 22 August 1967.

3. However, it was able to locate a Washington, D.C. policeman (whose name was deleted by the censor) who claimed that he saw the object. He stated that he was on duty in the Georgetown area on 22 August 1967, when he noticed an unusual light in the sky. Like a flare. He said the object appeared to be about the size of a basketball and yellowish in color. He first saw the light after noticing other groups in the area and trying to determine what they were looking at. He said the light was almost overhead and that when he approached, the object moved away. He said it was standing on the corner of Wisconsin and Q Streets.

4. Capt stated that his first reaction to the object was that another policeman had been observing it at the same time and had said it was similar to what he had seen on the evening of 22 August 1967.

5. It is deemed this possibility of the object being the result of a prank. He said that was what he thought it was when he saw the object.

6. I asked to watch for the object to appear again and let me know if it did. He said he would and would advise the other policemen in the vicinity.

Nielson, 1st Lt., USAF, describing his opinion that the object sighted over Georgetown on August 1967 was likely a red lighted balloon released as a hoax. The letter is addressed to the University of Colorado, ATTN: Dr. Condon.

It is my opinion that the object sighted over Georgetown on 12 August 1967 was either a red lighted balloon released by someone as a hoax. I plan to take no further action unless the object reappears.
