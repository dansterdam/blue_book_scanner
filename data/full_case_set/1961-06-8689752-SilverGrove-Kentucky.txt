The image contains three sketches. The first sketch appears to be a curved line representing the horizon, with a labeled point "A" on the curved line and a labeled point "B" on the same curved line. The second sketch shows a larger curved shape, with instructions to refer to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch. The third sketch shows a landscape with a person standing in the foreground.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line if the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line if the object was below the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.
