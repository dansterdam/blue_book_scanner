24 Mr. Burns told me how to find the meadow in which the object was reported. I drove there. checked the area where the object was reported seen, and located a number of impressions not fitting any vehicle's description. I found the meadow, stepped off 100 yards along the edge of it where there is a fence. This revealed an area on the far side of the fence where the grass showed definite signs of something heavy having been there. I then drove to an old bridge which was reported as the location where the object was seen to rise and to the area from there. 45 to 50 feet from where the meadow started there were impressions of something having been on the ground. The dirt showed definite signs of disturbance, apparently the object had rested there for a time. I have no idea what could have made these marks other than a heavy body having been there. The object was reported as being dome-shaped and silvery in color. It was estimated to be about 60 feet in diameter. It rose vertically to an estimated height of about 500 feet and then accelerated rapidly out of sight. I next checked the area where the object was reported to have taken off. This area was about 150 feet from the initial landing area. Here again there were some ground markings, although not as distinct as those in the initial landing area. I returned to the first landing area and as near as I could determine, the ground impressions were about 6 feet in diameter. This was the area in which the object was reported to have been resting. I do not know what could have made these impressions other than a heavy metallic body having been there. I have had considerable experience in identifying various types of ground impressions, and these were definitely not characteristic of any known type of vehicle. They were not the type of impressions that would be made by a soft, rounded object, such as an ordinary balloon, but rather the type of impressions that would be made by a heavy, rigid metallic object.

Force of which 14 were classified as unidentified number of personnel and others attending the 17th "who only reported seeing the lights in the air again, and the effect on the power of his car, and any other observations they could make" Gorman case report:
Received on January 27, 1948Gorman fighters attacked case:
On the night of October 1, 1948 1st Lt. George F. Gorman of the North Dakota Air National Guard was engaged in a prolonged and unusual encounter with a strange light while on a routine night training flight out of Fargo, North Dakota. The object was tracked on ground radar, and intercepted visually by Gorman who pursued it for over a half hour, at times maneuvering around the object at high speed. Gorman repeatedly fired on the object without damaging effect, yet the object occasionally accelerated and made violent turns suggesting intelligent control. The air force concluded that Gorman had encountered an unidentified flying object. This case has been confirmed by competent radar witness and the pilot's account as written up in the official report. There is no doubt that Gorman had an encounter with an unidentified aerial object that demonstrated flight characteristics beyond the capabilities of known aircraft.
Strongly pleasing from the greatly detailed. 2 pages report from Mr. Bowen was any reference to all his earlier reports and attachments which he had made in regard to the particular case of Gorman and which they would easily have verified at the local weather station before making their final determination:
Hynek has made a recommendation to Project Blue Book that a scientific study be made of the Gorman case. The Air Force has ordered that a scientific panel be convened to study and re-evaluate the details of the Gorman case. This panel, it is to be hoped, will take another look at the evidence as presented originally, and include any other evidence which Project Blue Book engineers, Mr. Bowen, and others may have accumulated since the first hasty evaluation. Project Blue Book to date has refused to reconsider the Gorman case, feeling that their original evaluation was correct. However, the data as presented to them by the officials of the North Dakota Air National Guard, and the radar confirmation of the object by ground observers, should justify a more thorough and scientific re-evaluation of this incident.
Nine days after Hynek said he saw the 90 to 100-foot-diameter object near Clarence, New York, on December 14, 1957, Hynek wrote this admission in a letter: "The director of Wright Air Development Center personally suggested that my telling the Air Force officials at that time of the sighting would have been 'inadvisable,' and I have generally followed this line of reasoning in my associations with Project Blue Book."

Text from the document:

On the basis of this reinformation, that such radioactive strength signals have been received, I strongly recommend that a professional investigating team be sent to the area at once to investigate this phenomenon further. The details need to be discussed at the highest levels, and especially the matter of the background radiation, as discussed at the front of this report by Dr. Gehrman. It is vital that this be substantiated immediately.

The matter of radiation constantly lingers in my mind. First, was the strong signal picked up by this team. Second, was their particular instrument, which I have known myself to be highly sensitive and accurate in the past. And the signal was already quite strong - one and a half miles from the highway - rather an unusual circumstance, as I'm sure you will agree.

In this area, as you know, there have been a number of other curious occurrences reported - both in the skies and on the ground. These reports, of course, vary greatly in their degree of reliability. Some appear to be wholly fanciful, while others seem to be rather factual and to the point. Those reported by reliable observers such as police, air traffic controllers, and military personnel, I consider to be of prime importance.

This report contains a number of other such discrepancies. For the details, I refer to the information given in the body of the report itself. I hope that you will find this information of interest, and that it will receive the immediate attention it deserves.

Sincerely yours,

The A.P.R.O. BULLETIN
MAY-JUNE, 1965

Huge UFO At Staunton, Va.
Mr. Steve Burns, of Grottoes, Virginia, claims to have seen an 80-foot high UFO from this east of Staunton, Virginia, on March 12, 1964. It was circular in shape, 125 feet in diameter with a band of bluish-white light on the bottom. The object came out of the sky north of the highway, crossed the road about 300 feet in front of the car, hovered for 8 to 10 seconds, then stepped. He said his car seemed to come to an involuntary quick stop. He saw two men in the cockpit of the object, which had no visible portholes, doors or seams. The object then moved up and east at tremendous speed, leaving no trail. About two seconds later, there was a sound of rushing air. 
It ran all night. Professor C. D. Jackson, head of the Physics Department at Eastern Mennonite College, examined the site and was unable to find any evidence of landing. It was 5 days after the UFO had parked, so much physical evidence could be expected to have disappeared. However, no evidence of its having been there was found. 
The population of Staunton is 28,000. This is in conflict with Burns' statement that the object was 80 feet high. With a population of 28,000, this seems unlikely. Some of the testimony seems to conflict with the reports. A series of small holes leading to the woods near Glassboro, New Jersey, were reportedly found in the woods, and it is claimed that this was to the seen of a known UFO enthusiast and NICAP member.

Transcribed text:

On the basis of this misinformation, that such radioactive strength deposited on December 21 should yield a positive return on later analysis, it can be seen that this information would be highly inaccurate and misleading. This radioactive strength had dissipated completely, and in this way they disposed of the problem indicated by the opening sentence in this case. As far as this radioactive strength is concerned, it had completely dissipated and left no trace. 

The two questions continually bother in my mind. First, was the Air Force holding back any real facts that might have some bearing on this case? Secondly, unless I am greatly mistaken, I never saw in any of the Air Force reports any mention that seemed to indicate the possibility of this being the residue of an A-bomb explosion dropping in the Harrisonburg, Virginia, area. The reason I say this is that in the Air Force report there are a number of other quite serious items mentioned which the Sergeant nearly always held down close to the ground, probably indicating something was being covered up. In this Air Force report there are a number of other quite serious items mentioned which the Sergeant nearly always held down close to the ground, probably indicating something was being covered up. These things are by no means indicated in the Air Force report.

In this Air Force report there are a number of other quite serious items mentioned which the Sergeant nearly always held down close to the ground, probably indicating something was being covered up. I cannot account for all of the discrepancies I find in this Air Force report. Back in 1964, when this case was being investigated, the policy of the Air Force was very strict regarding the release of any information on UFO's. It is my opinion, based on the evidence, that the Air Force was holding back some very important facts in this case. Regarding Mr. Burns: "Without a thorough psychiatric examination, I cannot state whether or not this man's testimony is consistent with fact. How can one consider a witness credible when the facts, as presented, are so completely contradictory." Now, until we have a thorough investigation into Mr. Burns' mental condition, I do not believe we should place much credence in his testimony. Even though, on the surface, it may appear convincing, psychiatric examination is needed to determine if this is not the type of thing one might expect from someone who has a tendency toward hallucinations, even delusions, senility it is just as possible that he has nothing whatsoever wrong with him. However, until a complete psychiatric examination has been made, I do not believe we should place much credence in his testimony.

As for a quick rundown of some of these cases,

On 12 December 1964 at about 11:30 a.m., Mrs. Colman, a housewife, called up the State Police and informed them that she had just arrived at a local motel and found a glowing, egg-shaped object about 30 feet in diameter resting on the ground near the motel. She should have said "18 inches" in diameter. (2) The object observed was about 18 inches in diameter. He should have said "at an angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal".  (3) The direction of departure was about sixty degrees to the right of the direction I observed. He should have said "about sixty degrees to the left of the direction I observed". There were no landing impressions observed in the adjacent farmhouse and that they had seen or heard nothing unusual. The object rose to an altitude of about 500 feet and moved off at a high rate of speed. Mrs. Coleman, who is the head of a local UFO Hobby Club and claims to have had some experience with the matter, stated that she had observed and reported a number of UFOs in the past. This, to my mind, further lessens the credibility of this particular report.

P.S. Regarding Mr. Burns: "Without a thorough psychiatric examination, I cannot state whether or not this man's testimony is consistent with fact. How can one consider a witness credible when the facts, as presented, are so completely contradictory."

Attention: I have read this report and believe that it is a genuine document from Project Blue Book.

VIRGINIA SAUCER LANDING LEAVES HIGH RADIOACTIVITY: On December 21st, Horace Bugg, a Harrisonburg, Va. gunsmith, was driving on Route 259 a few miles east of Staunton, when he saw a UFO which he estimates to have been about 120 feet in height. The object was at about 300 feet in altitude and was cigar-shaped with a dome on top. It was whitish-green in color and appeared to be spinning or rotating as it passed overhead. As it went through his car's windshield, he noticed that the radio and electrical system were temporarily diminished in power. He also felt a "sense of force" and warmth, which he attributed to the UFO's power. The saucer disappeared at a high rate of speed towards the northeast and east. Bugg later reported that the ground over which the UFO had passed showed a high degree of radioactivity.

HQ. CASE (INFO™ MATION ONLY) SUBJECT: Harrisonburg, Va.

In our non-scheduled Newsletter #72 we gave the story of seven teenagers who reported seeing a light in the sky over Harrisonburg, Va. late last January. A photograph was also taken by the boys. In our report we indicated that further details on this case were forthcoming.

The follow-up on the Virginia landing story, as reported in our March 2nd issue: The information obtained indicates that the youngsters have now retracted their original story. According to the local newspaper, when asked by local newsmen to confirm or deny this rumor, the answer was given by the mothers of the boys that "the youngsters were merely joking and did not actually see a UFO or have a follow-up on the Virginia landing story." The information further states that the youngsters, when interviewed separately, confirmed this statement.

In regard to the "physical evidence" found along a New Jersey highway claimed to be part of a UFO, Laboratory analysis has revealed that the material is similar to parts used in the manufacture of a certain type of commercial aircraft. No access to laboratory facilities is given to any person who has access to the material. As yet, none of these persons have reported being in contact with the sample, and full details of the analysis received with the letter from Wright-Patterson dated February 24th, a copy of which was sent to the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, has not been identified the material.

C.B. DYE REPORT INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS PHENOMENA, WASHINGTON, D.C.
MEMORANDUM: On November 10, 1964, I received a report of an unidentified flying object (UF0) observed on November 6, 1964, near Harrisonburg, Virginia. The report was made to the State Police by WILLIAM VHEATLEY, living at Dayton, Virginia, who reported that he had observed a strange object in the sky while driving along Virginia Route 257, about 5 miles north of Harrisonburg. 
WHEATLEY stated that the object was first observed about 7:15 P.H. and that it remained in view for approximately 7 minutes. He described the object as round or oval in shape, about the size of a basketball, and glowing with a brilliant blue-white light. According to WHEATLEY, the object hovered motionless for a short time, then accelerated at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight. 
WHEATLEY stated that there were no other known aircraft in the area at the time and that the object was not accompanied by any sound. He stated that he was positive the object was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, or any other known flying object.
About two hours later, WHEATLEY reported the incident to the local state police, who in turn reported it to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. OSI then contacted the investigator, ROBERT PRATT, of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), Washington, D.C., who subsequently contacted me regarding the incident.
I immediately went to the reported sighting area to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. This was 3 days after the reported sighting. Although it was the gathering of physical evidence that was the primary objective of the investigation, the fact that 3 days had elapsed since the sighting made it very difficult to do so. However, a careful search of the area was made, and a few interesting points were noted:
1. There was a blackened area about 10 feet in diameter on the ground at the approximate location where the object was reported to have been hovering. This blackened area was not present prior to the sighting, according to WHEATLEY.
2. The visitor from outer space was reported to have been observed for about 7 minutes, during which time it hovered motionless for a short period, then accelerated at a terrific speed and disappeared. It was estimated to be about the size of a basketball.
3. WHEATLEY stated that when the object first appeared, it was about 150 to 200 yards distant and about 50 feet off the ground. It then moved closer to him, to a distance of about 75 yards, before speeding away.
4. WHEATLEY was positive the object was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, or any other known flying object.
PRATT informed me that he had interviewed WHEATLEY in detail and that WHEATLEY appeared to be a credible witness. WHEATLEY is a mature, responsible individual who has had no history of mental illness or any other condition that would in any way detract from the credibility of his statement.
This was 3 days after the UFO had briefly rested there. I could not be more definitive in my analysis, as the blackened area was the only physical evidence that remained and it was not possible to make a detailed scientific examination of it at that late date. However, the blackened area did seem to corroborate WHEATLEY'S report that something unusual had occurred at that location.
In summary, this appears to be another incident of an unidentified flying object being sighted and reported by a credible witness. While there is no conclusive proof, the physical evidence noted and the apparent credibility of the witness lend support to the belief that something unusual did occur. We hope any such will make the very unusual clear.

REPORT TO NICAP

Last saturday night something and unplanned observation of strange object in the sky taken place. Hereafter the details of the incident leading to the spot, but when the hour arrived for us to go to the place four mile from Harrisonburg, Virginia, on Route 11, we could not pick up the object, so we decided to keep the appointment with a lot of guns which burns had repaired for the dealer. I do not know just what he told me, but he said there in the news: "J.S. told me how to find the meadow in which the object had landed, and he said that we should see it from the edge of the field directly." We went to the dealer's, who said that the future course director had found nothing on the scanner when with the Geiger counter turned on, and I talked across the field eastward. When we got to the place some cornfield, the owner said he had observed nothing unusual and did not care to be disturbed. The needle swung off the dial a number of times, I know the probe stick my uncle gave me that way and, so then I stiffen up the landing area with the probe stick and walked far off the landing site, the needle would not return until I had planted it there. Unfortunately, before we were halfway through this investigation, our party Cook, fortnatly before his death, and someone threwing a rock at us, and I heard the men talking say that the UFO had landed somewhere in that meadow, saw me there, stopped their car and got out. The later counter I used is a Jordo Model 2612 portable Survey meter, and according to Geiger the needle would not drop to zero until it got near to the landing area. The several times that I had evidently picked up radioactive particles. The owner said on the last time that the Geiger counter indicated it was buried somewhere. The needle did not return to normal until I had withdrawn the tube with my hands. To clean it I had dripped the probe stick into the landing area with the probe stick and to clear it I saw the landing area with the probe stick the second time. to scend upward and did not "descend" this, I said above five may apparently strong indication what hour were striking the tube from various directions.

Jones 12 December Richmond reports: the bright afternoon, air force base, after telephone conversations had planned the pickup during the day, and they accompanied me with two assistant investigators of Captain Hammond's college, and we were instructed on what to do in sighting, both on the way and on arrival at the place of the sighting. Also the investigation of the high radioactivity. Dr. Lee Dallas Corley, reporter for the Richmond Times-Dispatch, who joined us while on the field.

Report to NICAP

Woody said, "This is an unusual sighting.  It's not routine.  If it was routine, I wouldn't be calling you."

As the new six of us walked into the field, still covered with four inches of snow, he said there was no little gratification to me to see the group exactly to the north of the circle, all together, looking as if discussing something. I noticed Bums and Horner at the time. It was now 8:20 p.m. when Horrace Burns and I had been near the place at the same time, after seeing the light in the east.  According to the analysis of the data presented, a real startling observation was gathered as follows:
The persons gathered apparently first saw something through the trees, which was seen floating 10-15 feet above the ground. It was very bright and appeared round or oval. It also was said to give off a glow, or some phosphorescence material. As the object started to rise, Woody said that the upper part seemed to open or spread out, with a definite light inside. When the object started to move again, the light seemed to diminish, and it then shot straight up in the air, with just a faint glow around the edges. Woody stated that during the entire observation, there was not the slightest sound. The object was in view for about a minute and a half.  

As the observers watched the object through binoculars, they noted that as it started to move, the glow was "dimming down" and when it shot straight up, there was less light around the edges. Woody said that as the object went higher, it appeared to be getting smaller and the light seemed to be diminishing. He stated that at least three persons who were there, including himself, could easily distinguish the details described. The shape was constantly oval or round, with no apparent protrusions or appendages. The color was described as a bright, dazzling white, with a slight bluish cast at times.  According to Horrace Burns, the main body of the object was from 50 to 60 feet in diameter, when observed at its closest, and the surrounding glow or halo was 12 to 15 feet across.

In view of all these facts, when it is reported that the air force had decided there had been no similar sightings in this area, it must be concluded that this sighting would constitute an unusual and probably inexplainable aerial phenomenon. It is the view of those present that a vehicle of this size would be clearly detected and identified by any competent observer, and the description given by these reliable witnesses would not be consistent with any known aircraft or space vehicle at this time. The presents both seemed substantially impressed by what they saw and did not seem to have any difficulty in clearly recounting the details.

Apparently the honest, straightforward, detailed testimony by Horrace Burns and its effect on the motor of his car, and my testimony supported by two reliable observers and confirmed by the investigating officers, would constitute evidence that there was something here that does not seem to be explainable on the basis of any information so far considered.

In view of the fact that the three main individuals concerned, and the 6 inches of snow and 2.3 inches of rain) exactly 1 inch per hour, there would be a total precipitation (3.7 inches of rain, 2.3 inches of snow water) exactly 1 inch per hour, there would be a total precipitation (3.7 inches of rain, 2.3 inches of snow water) exactly 1 inch per hour.

CONCLUSION: It is believed that a vehicle of this size would be clearly detected and identified by any competent observer, and the description given by these reliable witnesses would not be consistent with any known aircraft or space vehicle at this time. Apparently the honest, straightforward, detailed testimony by Horrace Burns and its effect on the motor of his car, and my testimony supported by two reliable observers and confirmed by the investigating officers, would constitute evidence that there was something here that does not seem to be explainable on the basis of any information so far considered.

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
The object was reported as tremendous in size, about eighty to ninety feet high and was described as cigar-shaped. It was reportedly white in color. The lighting condition was such that colors of the cars and other objects could be identified. The object was about six feet from the ground. This band of light was about 12 inches in diameter which would have been above a man's standing height.

MOTION OF OBJECT:
The object was first observed through the windshield in the upper left hand corner. The object approached from the north at an altitude higher than a transmission line.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted all the text found in the document:

Report to IIDAQ

Two questions continually linger in my mind: First, was this Air Force survey accomplished solely or mainly b y alpha rays? And, second, was their particular insistance on determining the direction of the rays even though experience has already shown that the detector may already been pretty reliable for use after the source of the rays has already been pretty adequately located with reference to the original fixed position.

In this air force report there are a number of other curious aspects and limitations: First, the very high incidence of these telephone poles at one point or another on highways. These telephone (sic) poles are approximately 75 feet in height. The report suggests that the objective is to be high enough to avoid or eliminate terrain masking, yet we are placing poles only up to 75 feet in height. This seems to indicate that the investigators had declared by USCO personnel to be as feet in height, which mass it by 40 feet is more than one hopes for from technically trained investigators and yet to the "determining" of Sergeant Moody's question that day, that he did not notice any spinning.

The report contains a number of other such discrepancies. For a quick run-down of these:

Instead of a (3:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. on Jan. 2) meteor body called my home at 11:30 a.m. on Jan. 2 to state that he had just "arrived" at a local motel and needed to shave and wash up and eat before going back to his "observation post", which he had just left.

(2) "In width", it should have said "in depth"

(3) "Injection of departure was about fifty degrees to the right of its approach direction." This would indicate that it is not 60 feet wide.

(c) "PARR & LEHMAN stated that he had contacted occupants of the station wagon and they had been notified." (Correction - However, more extended testimony of the two research engineers who shared my Geiger-counter readings at the local radio programs in the area indicates the 930 investigators a e number of the program on the subject of UFOs, although WSA on Dec 29 announced the existence of this peculiar singular case.)

The lengthy story(a) "At no time during the sixty minutes of investigation was the witness distinctly observing the highway" seems to indicate that no positive conclusion regarding hallucination is possible.

- page 14 -

The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present on this particular page. 

The text produced by the OCR system is as follows:

"Reliable witness not questioned. This seems like contradictory testimony. How can one consider a witness reliable, if one also suspects that he may be mistaken in his identification, or even hallucinatory, even hecklinq, possibly if it is not he who should have a thorough physical examination where 35 additional witnesses to the same sighting were examined. The lie detector test, while it is true that at the time the sighting was made, the object in school boys, and in that of Stanton, who saw a large OFD traveling rapidly about 500 or 600 feet in the air and the landing an after the sighting, which occurred about 3:30 minutes before the boys called the police. The object was first reported to the Air Force, about 10 minutes before the police were called but it is doubtful that this intervening period would do much to eliminate the possibility of mistake or hallucination on the part of the witness. This and the additional witnesses help to corroborate the reliability of the witness. Larry 11 and J. Richmond told - Dispatch articles that they saw the object had it any substantial supporting physical evidence. there was no additional witnesses. 

This paper does not exhaust the inconsistencies and discrepancies in the official report of its 'official investigation' one or two of which seem to indicate that the report should be considered less than fair and open-minded. As a consequence, a good many persons who have studied the data that is available, remain seriously unconvinced that the Air Force, in its haste to explain away the aerial phenomena, adequately investigated the case. The subjeot for reasons unknown to us, has not been adequately by the means available to the Air Force, Project Blue Book, has on force vs recommendations responsibility.

While on the whole we have very high regard for the United States Air Force, it's tremendous responsibilities regarding the security of our country, not to mention the strain in the scientific community and the public, we cannot help feeling that the aerial phenomena section of the foreign technology division, and some of its personnel."

Dear Major:

I am enclosing a toasted copy of a PFRO bulletin. Please note the reported details of the unusual light observed by the military personnel over the Montcello area of Virginia on 8 July 1958. It is clear if at all possible. Apparently there was some conversation between the observer pilots and the tower, but things like that can't get hipped in the bud at the very beginning. It gives an awful lot of details for the man who still U.I.F., it might know. We don't know why the newspaper reporter should be contacted to see just what the original stimulus was.

I am also enclosing a toasted copy of a note from Mr. ____ . He was the one who reported the Toledo case which was rather similar to the Montcello case. You might be interested in obtaining more details of the terrain around there.

Reference 18 August 1958, 200 miles east of Dover (Atlantic). Would it be possible to get the names of those witnesses? I would like to write to them and have each one give me a completely independent statement and drawing of what they observed. I feel this could be done in a way which would show the discrepancies and any common details which might appear. It might have been a relatively stationary balloon which balloons often appear to be. Since everything over the Atlantic would tend to move out to sea, it might be difficult to get the comments of the individual crew members. I would like to find out how much the object appeared to move in relation to the stars or horizon.

Last Sunday I took occasion while leaving around to call this German professor you will remember, the one who writes for us occasionally. He was not there but I did speak with Mademoiselle Colette, the secretary. She told me that X was then visiting some people who were called, as far as I could gather, Oeil. She did not explain the fact that no one else on a well travelled road would not have seen what the X object did by failing to call a possible line on their programme reality. Games gave a completely clean bill of health which, of course, I expected. I also wanted to know how, when the ground was covered with four inches of snow, there were no traces of anything having landed besides.

- page 16 -

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The text in the document is as follows:

The field is apparently moved, and he maintains that even without the snow a landing in a suitable field would be quite difficult. He said that those craft put him in mind of little boy's toys, and it shocked him that it would be very important to get the testimony of such witnesses because the public should be informed concerning the world. He said he would report to NICAP. When I get it, I shall send you a 'carbon copy' because I am not particularly interested in the 'little boys' toys' type of incident, and moreover, it seems that in all probability no one would have wanted to see anything about this particular incident, no point out that it took me some while to make his initial report. So one can take that for what it is worth. 

P. S. Egan maintained that while this was his only experience - you see my usual way of seeing anything of an unusual nature!

U.F.O. Investigation Office

Dayton, Ohio

Gentlemen:

I have a good friend at Eastern Mennonite College in Harrisonburg, Virginia who on December 23, 1963 experienced an U.F.O. sighting. He told me the following:

He was driving on the highway between Staunton and Harrisonburg when he saw what he thought was a large aircraft, but as he drifted to a stop the object passed directly overhead, circling the highway about 175 feet in diameter. He judged the object to be about 125 feet in diameter.

I have no more details and what happened after. However, he said it set there about two minutes and left at a terrific speed toward the mountain at a terrific rate. The speed was so great the motor seemed to drive away very suddenly. 

This is probably routine to you, but the significant point is...on December 26, 1964 he had him show me the area and we went to the spot. The Geiger counter showed intense radiation where the object was sited for the object was terrific, in my opinion. No doubt the area is still radioactive.

Dr. Ginman did not say what type of rays were present, but this should be of some help to you.

Landing and obtained a reading on the geiger counter which he indicated had a count of 7,000 counts per minute. Highway 250 has heavy traffic. At no time during the sighting was there any indication of radioactivity on the ground or any damage to the foliage at the landing site. He indicated that he would forward his investigative data and information but was requested to give no further information. The time of the sighting was reported as after dark during twilight.
Lights were reportedly seen descend on the highway and the object began on the highway. Sunset for 21 Dec at 1645. If the sighting was approximately 1645, allowance should be made for the mountains and the fact that the object appeared to contact the ground at a range of approximately 3 miles, thus visibility would be obstructed by the mountains for at least 30 minutes. The sighting lasted 11 minutes with a destination of plus or minus 6 min. placing the moon below the horizon. The time of the sighting is estimated as shortly after 1700.
ANALYSIS:
Radiation: The most pertinent fact in the alleged landing was the geiger counter reading by Project personnel. The radiation count of 7,000 counts per minute consulted Major James Sproul, specialist in radiation. Major Sproul stated that this count was not considered unusually high when related to natural background count rates. Since the geiger counter used by investigators indicated no abnormal readings, there is no alternative but to conclude that radiation is not a factor in this case.
CONSIDERATION OF POSSIBLE HALLUCINATION, PRANK OR A HOAX: 
 "During the conversations, interview and subsequent trip to the alleged landing site, there was nothing derogatory in the actions or statements of the witnesses to indicate that the conclusion regarding hallucination is possible. The witness's reliability is not questioned."
"Possibility of a prank or trick being played upon the witnesses is considered, since an unusual sighting and anomaly reported. However, no connection was established between the witnesses and any known factors to support this speculation, so no conclusion for this can be considered."
"It is considered that possibility of a hoax was considered. There is no apparent motive. It seems unlikely that the witnesses would attempt to deride if the sighting were determined to be a hoax."
CONCLUSION:
It is believed that a vehicle of this size would be observed by additional witnesses at the time and location of the reported event. There were no additional witnesses. There was no confirmation of radioactivity in the area. Grass and weeds had not been damaged. There was a total lack of any indication that an unusual event had taken place. Analysis of the data collected fails to reveal any evidence of an alleged landing.

Large UFO Reported Sighted in Augusta
By Dallas M. Kernes
The Virginian-Pilot, December 8, 1964
The reported sighting of a 30-foot diameter flying saucer near Harrisonburg, Va., Tuesday attracted the attention of the Military Air Command investigation team here. Sergeant Moody insisted that the object he saw was not a plane but an unidentified flying object.
Sergeant Moody, however, noted that his description of its appearance and flight matched that given earlier in the week of a similar object seen around 8 p.m. in the Shenandoah Valley area of Rockingham County.
After a field inspection with Moody as a witness, the investigators from the Air Force apparently are satisfied the report was valid. They declined to be quoted by name, but said they were convinced the sergeant actually saw something "out of the ordinary" in the sky.
Sergeant Moody said that at approximately 7:30 p.m. Tuesday he and his wife were driving toward Harrisonburg when they observed a brilliant white light in the sky. Moody said he watched the object through binoculars and saw that it was circular in shape, about 30 feet in diameter, with "pulsating colored lights around the edge." He said the object appeared to be hovering about 500 feet above the ground.
Moody said the object was "just as clear as day" and that it suddenly shot off at a high rate of speed toward the southwest, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds.
According to Moody, the object was accompanied by a loud humming noise.
After making his report to the police, Moody said he was questioned for more than an hour by two Air Force investigators from the Air Defense Command Center at Fort Belvoir. They told him they would make a full investigation of the incident.
Sergeant Gehrman, professor of geography at Eastern Mennonite College, said he was among several persons who saw the object Tuesday evening. Gehrman said he and others were driving to a Christmas party when they observed the light in the sky.
"We watched it for several minutes," Gehrman said. "It was a brilliant white light that seemed to be hovering and pulsating with light. As we watched, it suddenly shot off at a tremendous rate of speed, much faster than any jet plane I've ever seen."
Gehrman said he was convinced the object was not a conventional aircraft. "It was nothing like anything I've ever seen before," he added. "The speed at which it moved was incredible."
During this four years with Project Blue Book, the Air Force's official UFO investigation program, Moody said he has had four similar experiences. He said each time the object has been described as a brilliant white light that suddenly shoots off at a high rate of speed.

VIRGINIA SHERIFF WARNS: WATCH UFO'S, JUST DON'T SHOOT AT LITTLE GREEN MEN
RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Augusta County Sheriff John C. Bent says there's nothing to get excited about when Virginians see flying saucers in the skies. Just don't shoot at the little green men. 
"This thing has gotten completely out of hand," says Bent. "People last night at night are reporting unidentified flying objects (UFO) in several parts of the state. And some claim they have seen little Martians (types) wandering around on the ground."
Bent said his office gets calls "almost daily" from Virginians reporting unidentified objects.
"We tell them, 'Just watch them. Don't shoot.'"
Beside, he adds, even if anyone finds one of these green fellows, it's not going to do them any good to know down."
Even the Air Force has gotten into the act. It has discovered any evidence confirming existence of visitors from outer space. 
"Our cases are never closed until they've been positively identified."
Last week a pastor added his name to the growing list of persons reporting sightings. The Rev. H. Preston Holton, pastor of the (Salvation) Church in Harrisonburg, Va., said he watched with a group of people Dec. 23. He reported a high radiation level.
Cadets at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Va. - close to Harrisonburg - also were reported as spotting the lights on several occasions.
And at Staunton last Tuesday night, three boys said they saw-what they described as three tiny, half-foot tall beings on the ground. 
"It looks like some of these stories have been exaggerated," says Bent. "But the little green men we can do without."
The little green man was probably more than half-an-indef tall, whose features and physical characteristics are somewhat more detailed-statistic than five-foot-steigh points.

MAN TELLS OF ENCOUNTER WITH A 'FLYING SAUCER'
HARRISONBURG. - Horace Burns told a crowd of townsmen here that he encountered what he believes was a 'flying saucer' on Dec. 12 between Staunton and Waynesboro. Burns said the object was about 30 feet in diameter and hovered about 10 feet off the ground. He said it was shaped like a saucer and had a red glow, though there was no apparent source of light. Burns also reported that the object left a radioactive residue on the ground.
LEHMAN MADE A SKETCH
Lehman said he has received a letter from a USAF officer who said the incident "appears to be authentic." He also quoted a passage from the New Testament, saying the appearance of the object coincides with Old Testament references to "chariots of fire."
Lehman said a man named Gehman made a sketch of the object, which he said showed it to be about 30 feet in diameter and shaped like a saucer. Gehman said the object had a red glow and was witnessed by several people. Lehman said the object was seen for about 10 minutes and then took off and disappeared.
MORE UFO SIGHTINGS REPORTED
WAYNESBORO (AP) - Three flying objects or "strange formations" were reported seen over the Waynesboro-Staunton area were round, orange-colored objects, a Waynesboro resident said Thursday.
The objects were spotted by several persons, said to be hovering, and then shooting off at a high rate of speed. One observer was quoted as saying the objects appeared to be "10 to 15 feet in diameter."
Another witness described the objects as a "yellowish-orange" color. At one point, the objects were reported to have approached within a quarter of a mile of the ground.

power line to the left of the highway. These telephone poles are approximately 12 ft. in height. Department of the highwa4r has marked these poles in the vicinity of the witness stop-
ped as though the car had run out of gas. The car proceeded about 25 ft. down the road and the driver said he came to a complete stop. A total distance of approximately 100 yds from the highway. Total time of the landing portion of the reported observation was approximately 5 minutes. The object rose vertically and rapidly but less than two minutes. Mr Burns got out of the car walked around to the front of it and looked at the object. At the time he shot off the first round of about 200 ft from the near-est end of the object which disappeared in a shower of sparks. Disappearing in a manner of a flare dropping. Direction indicated that it went of in an upward direction. There were no exhaust or contrails noted.

CHECKS FOR RADIATION:

A thorough geiger counter check of the area was made. At no time was a reading obtained to indicate fallout or radioactive background radiation. The dial on the watch of the college student with the car indicated a reading of 1.5/mn. This instrument had been recently calibrated and was found to be in good working order. The range of the instrument is 0-2500 mr/hr.

Public Relations:
During the investigation at the alleged landing site, Mr Dallas M Keraey reporter for the Shenandoah Valley News Bureau, P.O. Box 846, Staunton, Virginia subscribed three articles to the 1 January 1965. A copy of an article is attached.

Examination of the field showed that grass and brittle weeds stems had not been depressed or broken over except where a large vehicle or object of any significant weight had landed in the field. This may have indicated that the land did contours had been disturbed but there were no house or structure damage and there had appeared on several local radio programs in the area. It was because of one of these radio programs that the search had revealed his contact the next day.On 29 Dec. On 30 Dec the search went to the area of the alleged landing.

Gentlemen:

I have a good friend at Eastern Mennonite College in Harrisonburg, Virginia, who is interested in U.F.O.'s. He told me that on December 21, 1964, as he was driving from his home in Broadway, Virginia, to Harrisonburg, he suddenly saw an object pass overhead and disappear very suddenly.  

As he drifted to a stop off the highway, a large flat bottomed, circular and domed object came over and hovered directly overhead at a distance of about 60 yards away. He estimated the object to be about 125 feet in diameter.

It had a glowing exhaust that followed the object as it moved away toward the mountain at a terrific speed. As it drove away very shaken up.

This is probably routine to you. The significant factor is that the object produced a counter from the Geiger counter he had with him. This showed intense radioactivity around it. No doubt the area is still radioactive to some extent.

But this should not be of some help to you.

Some Believe, Some Doubt

UFO Story

By Dallas M. Rernes
Times-Dispatch News Service
WASHINGTON. Jan. 13 -For three days before Christmas, skeptics and believers in unidentified flying objects
had it out here in a controversy that threatened to rival the Christmas controversy itself.

It all started when Gerald Hickman, a California mining engineer, told a press conference that he had sighted a
circular, flashing object hovering over the field at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico on Dec. 16.
The Air Force said this was "absolute nonsense" and that nothing had been picked up on its radar screens.
Shortly after, Gordon Cooper, an astronaut who is on the list of Gemini-Titan and Apollo space flight crews, lent credence
to Hickman's story by reporting that while a pilot in the U.S. Air Force he had sighted a UFO in flight.

Then the controversy began in earnest. Believers quoted other cases to back up the Hickman and Cooper reports.
Skeptics questioned the credibility of the witnesses and pointed to inconsistencies in the reports.

Until Sergeant Moody files special report, it's routine or normal. If it was routine & identified, it's not routine. If it was not routine & not identified, it's not routine.

Some said the reason Hickman's sighting was not picked up on radar was because the object was under radar level.

Others argued the object could have been a weather balloon or another type of aircraft.

This controversy was not resolved by the exchange of word-for-word statements. Like most controversies involving UFOs, neither side was willing to give an inch.

It is very possible that another sighting, perhaps one far ahead of us enabling us to travel across interstellar space, may be "explained away" as a weather balloon or some other commonplace object.

Major Keyhoe is main contention that the evidence he has accumulated leads to the conclusion that UFOs represent vehicles under intelligent control from outside this earth.

To date, no unidentified flying object has ever been explained satisfactorily, Major Keyhoe says. There is nothing in the Air Force files, he contends, that would enable scientists to explain any of the hundreds of cases on record in a manner that would convince ufologists that these were not intelligently controlled vehicles from some other world.

Regardless of what the future may hold for the problem of UFOs, there is no doubt that reports of these objects which presently are accidental remain one of the world's great mysteries.

Just Don't Shoot, Sheriff Warns

Virginians See Flying Saucers

By TOM PENDERGAST

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - All the little green men reported in the sky, Sheriff Rutland Hamm of Augusta County says, "Just don't shoot. I ain't going to let anybody in the county start shooting." 

"This thing has gotten completely out of hand," says Sheriff Hamm. 

If John B. Kent, of Augusta County, "is right, and we see reflections of these strange objects in the sky," then anyone carrying firearms accompanying them, "will be dealt with, says Hamm.  

"Besides, he adds, even if creatures from outer space have landed us - 'Who's got the right to move them down?'"

Even the Air Force has gotten into the act. It has discovered no evidence to confirm the existence of either flying saucers or little green men. But, for the record, "Our cause are never closed until the reported objects are satisfactorily identified."

Almost daily, Virginians are reporting "unidentified flying objects - UFO - in several parts of the state. And some claim they have seen little green men wandering around on the ground." 

"Anyone can go out at night," says Kent, "and see strange things in the sky."

GIGANTIC UFO LANDS NEAR STAUNTON, VIRGINIA

Unidentified flying objects were again sighted on the evening of December 21, 1964, about 5 miles east of Staunton, Virginia, according to the report received by the Flying Saucer Investigating Committee of Akron, Ohio. The sighting was reportedly caused by the air currents under it. It suddenly came straight up and disappeared into the clouds in a matter of seconds after being above the ground from 8 to 10 minutes. The object was described as silvery in color, and emitting a bright light. Its size was estimated to be 125 feet in diameter and 35 feet high. Its speed was estimated to have been about 10 miles per hour.

Two cars, one carrying Mr. and Mrs. Burns, the other carrying another couple from Staunton, saw the object again and were surrounded by a bright light from it. Mr. Burns stated that the object had illuminated the entire area and was apparently very much interested and concerned with the two cars. The next day, the local newspaper published the story and stated that many highway patrol officers had confirmed the sighting, and that the object had been tracked on radar. It is stated that many highways must have been closed by the USAF, as the object had landed on a highway. This account was taken from a report by Major Idadooe of the USAF, stationed at Langley Air Force Base.

Horace Burns went home and told Mrs. Burns the story of what he and his wife had witnessed. The next day, he called the local newspaper and reported the sighting. The newspaper, in turn, called Major Idadooe of the USAF, who confirmed the sighting. Major Idadooe stated that "this is the first time this has happened in my seven years' experience." He further stated that the "object emitted a bright light and hovered at about 500 feet above the ground for 8 to 10 minutes." After that, it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared into the clouds in a matter of seconds.
