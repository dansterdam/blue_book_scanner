    Day        Month       Year
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
    My twin daughters were with me on our East Patio. I called their attention to something unusual on the horizon, just over Verdugo Hills. We observed a very brilliant ball of light moving too slow for an air plane, to remain in the air unless it was hover or landed.

Manufacturers of my Products
March 17, 67

Edwards Air Force. 
Gentlemen: 

My twin daughters are 17 years old. I were through our office frequently when something came over us. 

It looked like a ringlees plane: could have been as long as the 707, maybe longer. 

It was moving very low over the back. 

It moves slowly north West; our home is in the Verdugo Hills on the extreme South tip of the hills. 1720 Hillcrest.

Her car does not know anything used by civilians could not have maintained altitude at the slow speed it was moving.

I have tried many articles, Police Dept. Lockheed. So far no one seems to know anything stronger than coffee!  

Know what it was?

Sincerely

The image contains a sketch diagram and a compass rose diagram. The sketch diagram shows the observed position of an object relative to the horizon and provides instructions for how to determine the observed altitude and azimuth of the object. The compass rose diagram appears to be a reference for determining the direction the object was moving.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "C" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? 
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

Only one
