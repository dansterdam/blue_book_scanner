ATTN: ATIAA-22

1. The following, received from the Cleveland Detachment of this District Office, is forwarded for your information:

On 5 August 1954, Mr. ----- ----- (Cleveland, Ohio), Equipment Co., advised Special Agent ------, -------, that he had sighted an object in the sky on 2 August 1954.

On 6 August 1954, Special Agent ---- --------, interviewed Mr. ------- at his residence. Mr. ------- advised that he sighted an object in the sky at 1717 hours, 2 August 1954, which appeared to be southwest of Lorain, Ohio. At the point of sighting, he advised that he was in the vicinity of the shopping center near the Cleveland-Hopkins Airport, Lakewood, Ohio. The object appeared to be the size of approximately a shirt button. He stated that the shape of the object was round and appeared to be rotating. There was a definite trail or stream of chromatic dispersions and the object was very clear in appearance, with no distortions observed. He estimated that the object was at an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet and he observed it through binoculars for approximately three (3) minutes. The object suddenly dropped vertically and came to an abrupt halt at approximately 2,000 feet, and then suddenly accelerated horizontally and disappeared. He advised that the object faded out, likening its disappearance to a TV set being turned off.

OD 21-21-51
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 25 August 1954

The document describes an observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) that was sighted on August 25, 1954. It states that the object was seen to be approximately six (6) miles from the observer's position, and that it appeared to be a "free fall" rather than an accelerated drop. The object was described as having no visible means of propulsion or visible lights, and its speed was estimated to be similar to that of a B-17 fighter plane in flight, having been observed to pass by three (3) times, or approximately 1,000 miles per hour.

The document further states that the observer, who is a member of the Cleveland Astronomical Society, has never sighted any object in the sky that he could not satisfy himself with its identity as an amateur astronomer. He advised that he was a member of the Air Force from November 1942 to November 1945, and that he had as a minimum four (4) or five (5) sources in aircraft identification.

The document concludes by stating that no further investigative action is contemplated by the District Office unless specifically requested by the Command.
