16. Comments of Preparing Officer: I am unable to determine the source of the reported lights. There was no air traffic in the area and the RAPCON MPR 14 radar did not "paint" anything at all. The relatively intense at Camp Lejune, close to the stationary lights, may have been a response to these flights. There were two distinct flights of migrating geese observed at approximately the time the lights were first observed. There may be some remote possibility that the beacon reflected the flying geese or the centered clouds is the area, but this is highly debatable. The moon is not considered a likely cause since it is believed the declination was 60 4.7' 8 with a local hour angle of 54 47.6'.
