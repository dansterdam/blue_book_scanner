Observer noted a silver-colored object about 25 feet in diameter with a blinking red light on the front and a blue light on the rear. The object was viewed through binoculars and was observed to be motionless. Photographs were taken but do not show the object clearly. It appears that the object observed, if any, was probably a balloon or some other natural phenomenon.

Colorado Springs, Colorado 
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

1. On 8 November 1966, at about 1730 hours, Mr. (name deleted) reported sighting an unidentified flying object (UFO) north of Colorado Springs, Colorado. The object was first observed as it passed over the mountains northwest of the witness' location and moved in a southeast direction. 

2. The witness described the object as being round, silver in color, and approximately 50 to 60 feet in diameter. It was observed for about 5 to 10 minutes as it traveled at an altitude of about 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the ground. The object was described as moving at a high rate of speed, estimated to be about 900 to 1,000 mph. 

3. No sound was heard by the witness as the object passed overhead. The object was observed to disappear over the horizon in a southeast direction. 

4. Based on the available information, this sighting is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. Technical analysis of the report failed to provide a conclusive explanation for the object observed.

The image contains a photo analysis report for an unidentified flying object observed in Colorado Springs, Colorado in November 1966. The report includes 7 polaroid prints of the object, which was photographed at night using a flash. The analysis describes the object's characteristics, such as its circular shape with a domed top and flat bottom, and the size and location of the light emitted from the object. The report was prepared by Douglas H. Crouch, an Investigative Research Specialist, and approved by William K. Turner, Chief of the Photo Analysis Branch.

TEXT OUTPUT FROM OCR:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 67-16
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 
LOCATION Colorado Springs, Colorado
DATE November 1966
AF
PRNS 7 polaroid prints (B&W) 
1. PURPOSE: This report is in reply to a request submitted by Major Quintanilla (TDSTR) to determine the identity of the object photographed.
2. ANALYSIS: Examination of the seven submitted polaroid-type prints has passed double blind analysis/reconstitution as contained in considered. The object, which appears only on photos one and two, was photographed at night using a flash. This is evidenced by the uniform shadows formed around the object. The object appears circular with a domed top and flat bottom having a diameter of 20 to 25 feet. The background indicates the object was situated approximately 250-300 feet from the camera. This is based on the small size of the object as it appears in the photos. By computing the camera focal length versus the size of the object as it appears in the photos, it is determined the object is approximately 250-300 feet from the camera. The light source which appears illuminating the object appears to be located on the ground and immediately beyond the perimeter of light emitted by the flash attachment. This location outside of the perimeter indicates the object is approximately 2-3 feet distant from the light source.

COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO
8 NOVEMBER 1966

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT - REPORT

1. On 8 November 1966, at approximately 2230 hours, the undersigned was traveling north on Interstate Highway 25 approaching Colorado Springs, Colorado, when he observed a bright light in the northwest sky.

2. The light appeared to be stationary and approximately 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be larger and brighter than any of the stars in the sky. Occasionally, the light would dim slightly and then return to its normal brightness.

3. The light remained visible for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, at which time it suddenly disappeared from view.

4. There were no clouds in the sky at the time of the observation, and the visibility was excellent.

5. This object did not resemble any known aircraft or celestial body. It is my opinion that this was an unidentified flying object.

SAPOIGG/Krs Cassel/nai/79079/3 Nay 6?
MAY 1 1967

Dear Kr.

The analysis of the submitted photograph revealed the following:
nThe photograph appears to be a negative of a flying obiect. Photo analysis of the submitted photograph revealed the following:
The object photographed at night using a flash attachment. The object appears to be illuminated by the photograph and that the object was of a clear white with a dome top and flat bottom. Indicating a disc-shaped obiect photographed has definite straight lines and sharp edges. The apparent high rate of speed or reflecting property is indicated by the blury effect of the outer edges of the object.
I hope this information is helpful. If y'ou have any further questions, please let me know.
Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.
