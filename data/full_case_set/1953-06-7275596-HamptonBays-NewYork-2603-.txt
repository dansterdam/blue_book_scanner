HAMPTON BAYS, NEW YORK 2603
On 6 June 1953, shortly after 10:00 P.M., a bright white sphere about 30-40 feet in diameter was observed by two witnesses for approximately 15 seconds. The object approached silently from the northeast and descended to an estimated height of 500-700 feet. It then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view to the southeast.
