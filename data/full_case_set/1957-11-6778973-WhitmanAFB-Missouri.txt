Request for Analysis - Electronic UFO Reports
AFOTN-491
Maj. Col. Hoffman

1. Request that the attached radar reports, together with any photographs, be reviewed and an analysis made of the information submitted.
2. It is understood that this matter is urgent and your assistance in this is appreciated.
3. The radar reports and photographs have resulted in considerable speculation regarding military aircraft traffic in the area. It is requested that a thorough and objective analysis be made of these records to determine if there is any truth to the rumors of unidentified aerial objects.
4. This office should like to be informed of the results of your analysis as soon as possible.
5. In accordance with paragraph 6, AFR 200-2, the identity of the observer cannot be disclosed unless required for the proper evaluation of the information. It is requested that this be kept in mind and that the confidential nature of the reports be preserved.

1. Reference is made to subject report submitted from Whiteman AFB, Missouri.

2. The information submitted, while voluminous, does not include a great deal of data which would be required for a thorough analysis of the report. The speed as stated is less than 3000 mph. As already reported, while speeds in excess of 3000 mph are not unknown, they are certainly rare. The altitude and size of the object, as well as its manner of flight, indicate it was not of interplanetary origin. (Much of this information is not included in the report.)

3. It is realized that the information submitted herein is of little comfort to personnel who have seen such returns on their radar. For this reason efforts are being made to secure a competent consultant on these matters who will be able to provide a more positive approach to the analysis of the subject incidents.

1. The contents of this disposition form provide description of a UFO sighting submitted from Whiteman AFB, Missouri, on 17 Dec 57.
2. The report indicates that the object sighted was observed from Whiteman AFB, Missouri, at approximately 1815 hours on 17 Dec 57. The speed, course, and altitude of the object are included. Estimates of date which would be required for a thorough analysis of the report are also provided. The report indicates that the greatest activity took place within 15 minutes of the initial sighting, and that visual tracks of the object were obtained.
3. It is realized that the information submitted herein is of little comfort to personnel who have seen such returns on their radars. For this reason efforts are being made to develop a more definitive approach to this subject than is currently possible.

There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a report from the 340th Bombardment Wing (Medium) (SAC) of the United States Air Force located at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri.

The text in the document states:

SUBJECT: (U) Unidentified Flying Objects

1. Reference message this Headquarters, DOI-750, dated 7 November 1957.

2. Attached are six diagrams depicting the tracks of UFOB's on the search radar that the initial inbound tracks appeared to home in on after sightings. The UFOB's remained in the area about 5 minutes, and then disappeared from the radar scopes. It should also be noted that there was no set pattern in regards to the direction of the tracks on the radar scope.

3. When on the radar scope, the UFOB's were easy to recognize and appear as large and bright as 5-6 B-47 targets. The pattern on the radar scope at the same time and thus it was possible to compare their radar returns. One difference noted between the UFOB's and the B-47 targets were that the UFOB's were not distorted by the radar sweep while the B-47 targets gave elongated returns.

4. As plotted on inclosures #1 thru 6, it appears that the UFOB's made sharp turns or changes in direction. However, their course gradually when viewed on the radar scope and was noted primarily by plotting the target bearings from the station.

5. Radar Photographs:
Precision scope photographs of UFOB's crossing the precision scope (6 September 1957) and from the acquisition scope (6 November 1957) are inclosed. The photograph is of poor quality as the camera was hand held and the face of the radar scope was not removed. The photograph was taken with color film, F-8 on one-fourth second. The time this photograph was taken, the UFOB target was comparable to the return of a B-47 aircraft and was tracked on both the azimuth and elevation sectors of the precision scope.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION SUMMARY

1. DATE OF OBSERVATION: 6 November 1957
2. TIME OF OBSERVATION: 1750 CST
3. LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: Whitman AFB, Missouri
4. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT(S): At 1750 CST, the Whitman AFB Radar Control Center observed an unidentified radar track on their radar scope. The track appeared to be at an extremely high altitude and exhibited unusual flight characteristics.
5. ACTIONS TAKEN: The C.I.O. was notified and a search was conducted for the object. No visual sightings were made.
6. CONCLUSIONS: After careful analysis of the radar data, it was concluded that the unidentified radar track was most likely caused by a meteor or other natural phenomenon. No further action was taken.

1. Except for the rather slow speeds reported, there is little of the unusual in these reported sightings. The fact that no discrepancies were attempind and also that no reference is made to visual observation or observation by other raders in the area make it impossible to determine with any degree of certainty whether the targets observed were true or false.

1. Reference message this Headquarters, DOI-7536, dated 7 November 1957.

2. Attached are six diagrams depicting the tracks of UFOB's in the vicinity of Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base, Oklahoma, from 22 October to 31 October 1957. The diagrams were received from the 5th Air Division (Def), Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base, Oklahoma, and are the result of radar tracking. The tracks show erratic maneuvers and change direction when
observed by radar trainers. It should also be noted that the turns were so sharp that normal aircraft could not have executed them.

3. From the radar scope, the returns were easy to recognize as they appeared unusually large and bright. Readings of airspeed, altitude, and heading as tracked by the radar varied from 5-7 degrees to 5-7 degrees, thus indicating abrupt changes in direction as well as a wide variation in speed. The difference in readings was not explained by the operators
as they were not correlated by the operators with any known aircraft.

4. Based on this analysis, it appears that the turns were unusually sharp and could not have been executed by conventional aircraft. The radar scope and tracks
suggest that the objects displayed performances beyond the capabilities of existing aircraft.

5. Radar photograph: As inclosure #7 is a photograph of the original film taken at 1113Z on 6 November 1957. The photograph is of poor quality, as the camera
did not hold the image of the radar scope. The photograph was taken with color film. At the time this photograph was taken, the 1330Z target was considerable
to the return of a B-47 aircraft and was tracked on both the azimuth and elevation scopes of the 1330Z target.

The image appears to contain a series of photographs, though they have been redacted and are not visible. The text indicates that "Enclosures #8,9 and 10 are photographs taken in sequence of an 'UFO' sighted while the search radar returns were taken on a C-47 aircraft with a K-17 aerial camera." However, the actual photographs have been removed from the document.

DOI, SUBJ: (U) UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
1. Enclosures #8,9 and 10 are photographs taken in sequence of an "UFO" sighted while the search radar returns were taken on a C-47 aircraft with a K-17 aerial camera. These photographs were taken on a partially overcast night and the target was in the center of the radar scope. The exact time intervals were not recorded. This target was approximately 30-40 miles away and was traveling approximately 600-700 mph.
