The diagram depicts the observer's perspective with dashed lines and angles marked in degrees, meant to indicate the position of the sighting in the sky. There are two points marked with "A" and "B" on a curved horizontal line which represents the horizon, likely indicating the positions of the phenomenon when it was first and last seen. Handwritten notations and a signature are also present near the diagram.

- page 2 -

The document image you've provided contains a compass rose diagram at the top and two sketched images at the bottom. I'll describe the images and then provide the text content.

Top image:
- There is a compass rose with cardinal and intercardinal directions marked (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, and the variations in between like NNE, ENE, etc.).
- Two letters are placed on the compass rose: "A" is positioned between E and ENE, and "B" is directly at E.

Bottom images: 
- The first sketch on the left shows a domed horizon view with clouds in the sky. A dashed line starts from the lower center of the image (indicating the observer's point of view) and goes up and to the right, labeled with an "A" at the start and a "B" near the top where the line ends, suggesting the path of the observed phenomenon.
- The second sketch on the right is similar to the first, showing the domed horizon but with a shorter dashed line connecting an "A" and a "B".

Here is the text as requested:

```
6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE
DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO
THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. 

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE
POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE
MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT
APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE
THE LARGER SKETCH.

The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document, presumably a report form related to an observation of a phenomenon, possibly a UFO sighting from Project Blue Book. I will now transcribe the text visible in the document:

It disappeared (below) eyesight.

PAGE 3 OF 9 PAGES

The handwritten notes include words like "It disappeared (below) eyesight." and there are various checkmarks in boxes, but the low resolution and faded nature of the handwriting makes it difficult to transcribe with certainty.

- page 4 -

The image appears to be a scanned page of a document and it includes a drawing at the bottom right section of the page. The drawing depicts a UFO, represented as a cylindrical shape with a dome on top. The main body of the UFO is shaded, suggesting it's dark in color, and the dome is annotated with the words "bright yellow." The handwriting appears to indicate characteristics of the observed phenomenon such as "dark greyish," and "domination" next to the main body, with "bright yellow" written alongside the dome.

Below is the text extracted from the document as requested:

The image appears to feature a hand-drawn sketch rather than a photograph. The sketch shows an oval-shaped object with an indicated direction of movement (shown by an arrow) and some form of exhaust or vapor trail underneath it.

Here is the text from the document:

The page contains two hand-drawn sketches and not actual photographs. The first sketch is a compass rose with the directions marked and the letters "A" and "B" to depict points of observation for an unidentified phenomenon. The second sketch shows a landscape with a depiction of the same phenomenon's path as it moves across the viewer's field of vision, indicated from "A" to "B."

Here is the text from the document:

---

6A. NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "A" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON TH COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

7. IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE "A" AND "B" WITH A LINE TO APPROXIMATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE PHENOMENON BETWEEN "A" AND "B". THAT IS, SCHEMATICALLY SHOW WHETHER THE MOVEMENT APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT, CURVED OR ZIG-ZAG. REFER TO SMALLER SKETCH AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO COMPLETE THE LARGER SKETCH.

1. Reference your unidentified observation of 20 November 1967. The FORM 117 which you completed shows the object as appearing in roughly the east and disappearing in roughly the north-northeast. Unfortunately, the form can be misleading as to the course of the object. Did the object seem to be approaching toward you at an angle (getting larger), staying the same distance, or moving away at an angle (getting smaller)? How certain are you of your directions? Did you use a compass? Since the sighting, have you talked to anyone else who saw the object? If so, could you provide their names and addresses?

2. This additional information is necessary before we can evaluate your sighting. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
