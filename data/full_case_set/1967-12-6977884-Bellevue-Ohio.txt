There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document, specifically Record 10073, which describes a UFO sighting in Bellevue, Ohio on 2 Dec 67.

The text of the document is as follows:

PROJECT 10073 RECORD
1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 2 Dec 67 08/00402
2. LOCATION: Bellevue, Ohio

6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: West
8. PHOTOS: [ ] Yes [X] No
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: [ ] Yes [X] No
10. CONCLUSION: Possible (AIRCRAFT)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
The observer sighted a saucer shaped craft with a light on the bottom and red lights on the sides. He picked up several friends and they tried to follow the object. The observer uses the term "it" to describe the objects. Several witnesses were contacted, but he stated that he saw only a red light that was a little like an airplane. The Bellevue contacted and requested to supply information, but received no similar reports on this night in reply to the request.

LT MARANO'S DRAFT
1. The observer wrote that "at the corner, I turned north, as I noticed that the sky was lit up to the N. W. I stopped and rolled down the window and looked up towards the sky. Then I saw the 'object' in #21, of the green form 164, he indicated that the object was only 300 ft away.
2. If the object was far enough away to light up the sky in the northwest, it certainly wouldn't be as close as 300 ft. Also, if the car was headed north, the driver should have had excellent visibility toward the northwest from the drivers front window. If the observer did have to roll down his window so as to see the object, the object must have been nearly overhead. What was the source of the light that lit up the sky in the northwest and caused the observer to stop? If the object was bright enough to light up the sky while 300 ft over the observers car, why is it that no one else in the area seems to have seen it at this point? Especially since his friends were only about 1500 ft away ("a quarter-mile away.")
3. "After telling the guys and pointing to the object, which was a quarter-mile away . . ." This seriously conflicts with the measurement of the only witness to return the forms that the object was only 300 ft away.
4. "Five in one car driven by _____, we started after yet the observer lists only three witnesses.

There is no photograph present in the image. The text appears to be a typed report or document describing a UFO sighting.

The text reads as follows:

The time was about 7:40, Thursday night. We were just getting off of church and school instructions. I turned North, as I turned I noticed that the sky was lit up to the northwest. I stopped and rolled down the window and looked up towards the sky. Then I saw the U.F.O. It was round and about fifty to seventy-five feet in diameter, and about ten to fifteen feet high, the bottom was curved. The sides were straight, but where the bottom touched the edges it was curved. 

The edge was lit all the way around. The bottom had a dome shaped object which was also lit up in white light. I turned around and started back to where I left rest the rest of the guys where. During the time I started back and the time that I got there, (about one-quarter mile) the white lights had gone off and the red lights came pointing to the object which now was at a distance of about a quarter-mile away. They jumped into their car. Five in the one car, drove off. We started after the object. We followed it for about three miles, till it had come out of sight. It did not go up but straight ahead and out of sight.

We stopped at the sign, we could still see about five ten miles ahead, we could tell that it stopped and came a little bit, but turned and went on.

The next day, another friend told me that at the same time that we headed west after that one, he was on his way home, and he saw one back behind our house. Then at the same time that we chased after the other one the one behind our house which seemed to be ready to land, then took off. It seemed to me that these two were together, and that as the one was getting ready to settle down to find a place to land, then the one that I saw may have seen that I saw him, and signaled to the other one that he was seen and that he was leaving. So the other one took off with it.

The airplane shaped object flew across from West to East. It was longer than a military fighter jet, maybe 40-50 feet long, and flying at a steady pace around 300-1500 feet in altitude. It had the elongated shape of an elliptical craft rather than a round flying saucer. The object was silent and did not seem to leave any trails or exhaust. I observed it for around 30 seconds before it disappeared from view.

- page 22 -

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an excerpt from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. I will proceed to act as an OCR system and extract all the text found in the document:

These three witnesses were each sent an AF Form 117 on 7 June 1966 but none of them completed and returned the form at that time. All three were sent an AF Form 117 again, on 27 March 1968. In question #1, the date of the observation is given as 17 September 1967, to the left of this date is also the date 7 December 1967. Also the witnesses in no way stated that the object "was saucer-shaped, that it had a revolving red light, that lighted all the way around, that the bottom was dome-shaped" as insinuated in Dr Hynek's letter but stated that he saw a light, "a little like an airplane" and that he saw the object a distance of 8 miles as indicated in question #12). Of interest are the fact that no one else in the area reported a similar sighting to us for that night. The police department feel it important enough to answer our letter and also the observer had a copy of the green 1219 reporting form on hand.

6. The duration, flight characteristics, the white light and red light in no way conflict with the evaluation of aircraft craft did not perform any erratic motions impossible to an aircraft in the words of the observer, "It did not go up but straight across out of sight."

7. I do not feel that the sighting represents any threat to the security of the United States; gives any evidence that the object sented any extraterrestrial craft or presents an information of scientific value.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram showing a sketch or illustration. The diagram depicts a curved horizon line and a trajectory path of an unidentified object. There are instructions and questions related to the sketch, such as indicating the position of the object relative to the horizon and drawing a picture to show the motion of the object.

Text from the document:

In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line that was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show the position of the object when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

1. We have something which the evaluation "possible" uncovered. It is all a question that can go in taking the above's testimony more or less at face value. It is interesting that two independent witnesses were in good agreement as to certain details. So much so that I believe still a third time, then said that it flashed and flicked, and both said that it last 15 minutes. If we make their composite testimony, then the direction of motion is unbekable. It can be adopted only if we severely discount statements that statement that it liked red and green alternately around.

2. I don't know where Bellevue, Ohio, is but I would suggest that next time it am in Dayton I make a point of investigating these witnesses even if only by phone. I think particularly on the length of time supposedly still. I believe this is a crucial point and if certainties that its standing still was the result of radial motion, one thin, how five minutes, then we have a substantial air observation in any case, identified, would apply for the moment until further interrogation.
