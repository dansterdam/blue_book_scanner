11. Captain John K. Frdina, Chief, Operational Intelligence. This is the initial report on this incident. Some observers were immediately of the opinion that the object was a weather balloon. A check of the weather balloon release schedule maintained by the weather section of K-55 indicated that the incident referred to was a launch of a weather balloon on 3 October 1957. The reporting officer observed the same phenomenon at 2000r.

a. The light came from a battery-operated lamp attached to a weather balloon.
Weather balloons are scheduled for release at 2000r but there is considerable local deviation from the schedule.

Previous report has on similar incidents have been prepared by 6th District OSI.
Report numbers and dates are:

a. RSF - 1-9-55-109-2-1, 25 June 1954.
