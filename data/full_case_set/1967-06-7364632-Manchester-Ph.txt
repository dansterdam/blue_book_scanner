The image contains a photograph that appears to be a hand-drawn diagram or sketch. The diagram shows a cross-sectional view of an object or structure, with labels indicating the "East", "Top", "South", "Bottom", and "West" orientations. There is also a question mark next to the word "Direction?", suggesting uncertainty or inquiry about the orientation or movement of the object depicted.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), so this diagram may be related to the documentation of a UFO sighting or observation.

JUNE 18 7:30
The object was first noticed in the sky at about 7:30 PM on June 18. It appeared to be a star or planet, shimmering and flashing with many colors, hovering over the treetops in the southwest. It remained stationary for about 10 minutes.
After about 10 minutes the object suddenly shot straight up at a high rate of speed and disappeared from view. The observation lasted approximately 10-15 minutes.
The observer, a resident of Manchester, New Hampshire, described the object as circular in shape, about the size of a quarter held at arm's length, and emitting flashing lights of various colors including red, green, blue and white. No sound was heard.
The weather was clear with unlimited visibility at the time of the sighting.

MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE 
JUNE 7, 1967 

Reported sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object or possibly Balloons in the Manchester, New Hampshire area on June 7, 1967.

The witness reported seeing a group of objects, approximately 10 to 15 in number, moving in a northeasterly direction over Manchester, New Hampshire at 9:15 PM on June 7, 1967. The objects were described as appearing to be in the shape of a cigar or sausage and appeared to be oscillating or wobbling as they moved across the sky.  

The witness indicated that the objects were at a high altitude, approximately 10,000 to 15,000 feet, and were observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before disappearing from view. No sound was associated with the objects and no other witnesses were reported.

This case was investigated and it was determined that the objects observed were most likely weather balloons launched from a nearby site.

 TITLE:
 UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA OBSERVED OVER MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
 REPORT BY: RONALD W. WILSON
 DATE OF OBSERVATION: JUNE 7, 1967
 LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
 TIME OF OBSERVATION: 0100 HOURS
 REPORTING AGENCY: PROJECT BLUE BOOK, U.S. AIR FORCE
 On June 7, 1967, at approximately 0100 hours, a male witness (name withheld) reported observing an unidentified aerial object over the city of Manchester, New Hampshire. The witness stated that he was outside his residence when he noticed a bright light in the sky which appeared to be maneuvering in an unusual manner. He immediately called the local police department to report the sighting.
 Officers from the Manchester Police Department responded to the scene and were also able to observe the unidentified object. Attempts were made to photograph the phenomenon, but the resulting images were blurred and of poor quality.
 The object was described as disc-shaped, with a bright white light at the center. It appeared to hover and perform rapid, erratic movements before accelerating and disappearing from view.
 This incident was investigated by Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects. After reviewing the witness accounts and the limited photographic evidence, the case was classified as "unidentified" due to the lack of conclusive information.
 No further details are available regarding this incident. The investigation did not yield any clear explanation for the observed aerial phenomenon.
