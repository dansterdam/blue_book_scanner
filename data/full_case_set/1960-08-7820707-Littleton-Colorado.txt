Dear Major Tacker:

I regret to inform you that the operation of the Air Force UFO information and evaluation service has been unsatisfactory. Several incidents of San Francisco residents sighting unidentified flying objects and believing that they were reporting these sightings to the Air Force have come to my attention.

I suspect that the public confidence in this service has been shaken through the experience of those San Francisco residents. It is my understanding that this service is designed to encourage the public to report UFO sightings, but I fail to see how this purpose can be accomplished if the public confidence is lost.

Also, several requests for information regarding UFO sightings have been made to the San Francisco office of the Air Force for the past several months with little or no results. The public is entitled to this information, and I believe it is the duty of the Air Force to provide it.

The above information will be strictly incorporated. Any cooperation you can extend to remedy this situation will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

STATEMENT OF KENNETH ARNOLD
7 AUGUST 1952 
On June 24, 1947, I was flying a Cal-Aero Clover Air Survey plane from Chehalis, Washington to Yakima, Washington.  At approximately 3:00 P.M. (PST) I sighted several very strange looking aircraft flying from north to south a little north of Mount Rainier. There were nine aircraft in the formation and they were flying at an estimated altitude of approximately 9,500 feet. The weather was very clear and the sun was shining brightly on the objects, reflecting brightly therefrom. As nearly as I could estimate their size, they appeared to be about the size of a DC-4 airplane. They appeared to be flat like pie pans and were trav

August 17, 1960
Pikes Peak Ranger Camp
On August 17th at approximately 5:00 PM, I sighted up in the Northeast sector of the sky some very strange objects. They appeared to be approximately 5 to 10 in number, traveling in a diagonal pattern, and climbing steadily higher and higher. Their formation was not consistent. The objects appeared to be round and silvery in color. After observing them for about 5 minutes, suddenly one of the objects began to drop rapidly and erratically downward. It seemed to dive and swoop and then level off again. Another object suddenly accelerated and took an abrupt turn to the right. The remaining objects continued on their diagonal course climbing higher and higher until they disappeared from sight. This is as accurate a description as I can give. I hope this report will be of assistance.

The image contains a sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting that occurred on August 17th at approximately 8 or 8:30 PM near the Plum Creek Prison Camp. The witness described seeing a dull light above the horizon that appeared to fade and then come back as a brighter object, moving from right to left across the horizon. The sketch depicts the observed movement and appearance of the light. No human faces or identities are mentioned or shown in the image.

Plum Creek Prison Camp

On August 17th at approximately 8 or 8:30 PM I went up in the forestry lookout tower to look around. About 9PM I saw a dull light above the horizon and it looked as though it was disappearing. Then it came back as a brighter light. This was observed by Mrs. -------------- and myself. The light appeared to fade and then come back as a brighter object, moving from right to left across the horizon. I lost sight of the light at times but it appeared to fade and then come back as a brighter object, moving rather quickly. It seemed to be headed in a southerly direction, disappearing from right to left at the same location. I followed it for many miles. I felt certain it was moving to my left, then upward. Because of it's pendulously slow at times, I lost it a number of times, and I managed to find it again.

No Case (Information Only)
11 August 1960
Boulder, Colorado

On August 11, 1960, at Boulder, Colorado Driver Ray Hawis reported the stalling of his tractor engine by a large UFO, which hovered about 500 feet off the ground. He said that his engine re-started after the UFO shot up, surrounded by "heat waves". A "thrumming sound" was heard and a steady blinking of lights was seen by Hawis in his close encounter. There were also several indications of attempted or actual "touch" landings.

CLOSE ENCOUNTER IN A COLORADO COUNTY: On August 12th, a farmer in Boulder, Colorado, Frank D. reported a strange experience he had had the previous day. He said that while plowing his fields, his tractor suddenly died. He estimated the UFO to be about 200 to 300 feet from the ground, and he could see no markings. After 10 to 15 minutes the object disappeared into the clouds, and his tractor again operated as usual. There was a sort of "velvet" appearance to the object, which was maneuvering carefully, and it appeared "in and out of sight" and "didn't seem to be in any great hurry". There was an all-pervading noise, like the humming of a swarm of bees. The object was hovering, and the farmer said it was about 50 to 60 feet in diameter. He did not notice any occupants. As the object went into the clouds, the tractor again operated as usual.

Dear Sir:

I am writing again in regard to the UFO residuals which have been discussed in my previous letters dated 7 March 1960 (see my letter dated 7 March 1960). 

I have delayed sending this material to A. T. C. for several reasons. First, for the fact that Air Force analysis should have an opportunity to study the complete history of the material before attempting tests.

A complete report of this case has been prepared for some time and was authorized for forwarding to your office as soon as practical. However, due to the rather complex nature of the case, and the desire to insure that every possible facet be covered in this report, the final preparation has been delayed.

For Francis Gary Powers' observation, you have probably observed that the proposed tests are not intended merely to prove or disprove the UFO nature of the observation. Rather, the intent is to obtain all possible information concerning the nature and characteristics of the object observed, in order that a better understanding may be reached.

I trust the foregoing clarifies my position in this matter, and I hope that the report will be forwarded to you within a reasonable time. If you have any further questions or comments, please feel free to call on me.

Sincerely yours,

(1) The case at Red Bluff, California, August 13, 1960, involving Sept.
15-23, 1960 observations provided range and altitude data.

(2) The two-day observation of a UFO near Holloman AFB, New Mexico, August 1960 involving May Hawks. As stated "excepted" detailed missile track information from AFMDC, Holloman AFB.

(3) The case at Tremonton, Utah, July 2, 1952 where 16mm motion pictures were taken.

Dear Sir:

I am writing again in regard to the UFO residuals which have been discussed (see my letter dated 9 March 1960 which you answered 11 March 1960).

We are very anxious to obtain any additional information regarding several reasons. We feel that Air Force analysts should have an opportunity to study these complete histories of the material before attempting tests.

A complete report of this type has been prepared for some time but we have encountered problems in getting it published. These problems appear to me to still be present to have been resolved and copies will be forwarded to your office and to others as soon as possible.

For reasons not entirely clear, you have chosen to withhold comment on our suggestions that these proposed tests be performed by an independent agency, rather than under the auspices of USAF and ATIC representatives.

If additional information on this procedure seems appropriate, I would be pleased to elaborate.

The accusations of Donald Keyhoe together with certain grave inconsistencies in certain Air Force public information releases has seriously undermined public confidence in your agency. The procedure we recommend would eliminate any basis for such public concern regarding the good faith of all parties.

I would also like to inquire whether or not the Air Force has reached any final conclusions concerning the following listed cases and, if so, what these conclusions are:

(1) The cave and surrounding area (simultaneous viewing from two locations) provided and range and altitude data.

(2) The incident near Boulder, Colorado (In Left Hand Canyon) on 11 August 1960 involving "tremendous object". He related "frantic" reactions symptomatic of Gamma radiation.

(3) The case described to you involving two employees of the San Francisco water department who observed a UFO hovering above a dam on July 13, 1960.

Sincerely Yours,

Satellite Relays -
2-Way Phone Call
"We're Reading You Loud and Clear," 
Californian Says in Historic Hookup

HOLMDEL, N.J., Aug. 13--A telephone call 
through space today established the first two-way con-
versation via an artificial satellite.

A tele-communication experiment was conducted 
with the use of the Echo I, 100-foot MYLAR plastic bal-
loon satellite which passed over the horizon and came
within range of receiver stations on both sides of the 
coast. A two-way telephone conversation took place be-
tween Holmdel, N.J. and Goldstone, Calif.

A newsman at 3:13 a.m. EDT "wasn't much of a
conversationalist," the scientists said, but President 
Lyndon B. Johnson and Vice President Humphrey spoke
both ways - "loud and clear" - through the satellite.

The COMMUNICATION opener was a telephone call 
from Goldstone, Calif. to Holmdel, N.J. which came 
through space at the speed of light.

The first two-way communica-
tion over the satellite had fea-
tured recorded messages by 
President Eisenhower and Senate 
Majority Leader Lyndon B. John-
son. The latest attempt was a
live phone conversation.

As monitored on tape, here is 
how it sounded:

"Are you reading me out there?"
"Yes, we're reading you loud and
clear," said Jones. "You sound
pretty good."

ECHO I STREAKS OVER PORTLAND, ORE.
40-Second Time Exposure Catches Satellite.--AP

AFTER 750 A.M., the balloon
passed to a point no longer on a
line between Holmdel, N.J. and
Goldstone, Calif., unavailable for
further experiments by the Bell
Lab group for 12 hours.

The bone-tired engineers and
lab assistants, many of whom had
been working intensely 13 straight
hours, "said little. They will re-
turn to concentrate on minutely 
detailed work to improve the 
length and quality of the calls.

At the dramatic moment of the
first phone call, though seeming
tense, there was little outward ex-
citement in the Bell lab.

5-WAY ASSAULT ON SPACE
U.S. SCIENTISTS RIP PAGE FROM SCIENCE FICTION

CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA. - (UPI) - America's space scientists
scored a new record yesterday in an historic milestone on space conquest. With the blast off of a 150-mile-a-minute rocket carrier, President Eisenhower's administrative team sent U.S. science a big step forward toward mastery of the heavens.

ANNOUNCED THAT a fresh cargo of the latest additions to the earth's artificial satellites—Discoverer XIII—in orbit they plan to send a radio signal back, possibly within a month.

Just as the Air Force test pilot Shepard shot up 115 miles to the world's altitude record of 115,700 feet last week, the U.S. scientists yesterday scored the biggest day in space science.

Fired an Atlas Intercontinental ballistic missile carrying a nation of radio-dispersal-experiment sensors into space. It can be seen by nearly every nation, including Russia, from over 15,000 miles per hour. 

After more technical troubles that threatened to postpone the experiment, the satellite WHICH WAS SENT INTO ORBIT FOR RUSSIA - was sent into orbit around the earth. The coast-to-coast experiment WHICH BOOSTED THE PRESIDENT'S Satellite-Discoverer XIII-in to space showed Echo's feasibility as the anchor to a global communications network.

SERIES OF Echo-type satellites could mark a new phase in world-wide television and almost instantaneous world-wide radio communi cations.

The successful recovery of the satellite—called Echo by scientists—proved it is America's seventh satellite success, paved the way for the Air Force's announcement that it would fire a thing into orbit soon.

It's No Meteor, That's Echo I Flitting By
According to the latest reports, Echo I, the inflatable satellite launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on Aug. 12, 1960, is now visible to the naked eye over the Dayton area as a small bright object traveling slowly across the sky. This 100-foot diameter satellite, launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., is being used to bounce radio signals around the world. It is now about 1,000 miles from the earth and will soon be visible each clear evening about 20 minutes after sunset, traveling generally from the west to the east. Echo I appears as a star that is brighter than the stars around it. It takes about 10 minutes to cross the sky. If you watch, you may also see a faint trail behind the satellite. This is caused by the ionized gas in the satellite's wake reflecting sunlight.

Be-Laps I To Join Stars
Over Dayton Tonight
Here is the latest news on the flight of Echo I, the inflatable satellite launched by NASA on Aug. 12, 1960:
Echo I will be visible again over Dayton tonight, about 10 minutes after sunset. It will be visible for about 10 minutes, traveling generally from the west to the east across the sky. The satellite appears as a bright star, brighter than the stars around it. Watch for it!

Discoverer XIV Goes Into Orbit
1 Missed Explodes After Launch; 
2 Others Fired Successfully

WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 - The Discoverer XIV satellite, carrying a man-made recovery capsule, was launched into polar orbit yesterday on the west coast. Although the recovery capsule failed to eject, the satellite itself was placed in a successful orbit.

The satellite, riding on a Thor-Agena rocket, was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., at 3:17 p.m. (EST).

The firing of Discoverer XIV came two days after the unsuccessful launching of Discoverer XIII, which was intended to be the first American satellite to recover a man-made object from space. The Discoverer XIII capsule failed to eject properly.

The Discoverer XIV satellite, like its predecessor, is part of the Air Force's Discoverer program, designed to develop equipment and techniques for satellite recovery. The ultimate aim is to recover film and other material from satellites for study without the need for them to return to earth.

Echo Gains In Altitude After TV Demonstrations
WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 - The Echo I balloon satellite, used for communication experiments and television demonstrations, has gained in altitude since its launching.

The communications satellite, launched Aug. 12, 1960, continues to circle the earth at an average altitude of about 1,000 miles - some 50 miles higher than originally planned. This altitude change is being studied by scientists.

No Flying Objects Seen in Tehama County Last Night
RED BLUFF, Calif. (AP) - "Those, a sonic boom. None was heard." 
Jack Stewart, a San Francisco newspaperman, his and his wife saw mysterious flying objects "like luminous meteors" near here Sunday night. But state highway patrolmen did not make an appearance last night. The county sheriff's deputies said they never did make an appearance on an "official call" Sunday night.
"The only clue-type spokesman said they never saw any searchlights near Mineral, just west of Red Bluff.
"Almost every week, local citizens report seeing "flying objects" flitting at "terrific" speed without making a sound. 
Almost two dozen others said they were with Stewart and his wife when they saw the objects last Sunday night in the Mineral area. TV newscaster Gonzales said the things flew in a circular formation, brilliant white with a red spot or spots. He said they were traveling unbelievably fast and moving at simply unbelievable speed - so fast that "they didn't make a sound." 
If an object exceeds the speed of sound it will create a sonic boom.

Invert'r *5 in California

An unusually complex combination of events produced an epidemic of UFO Sightings in northern California during the weekend of August 1-2, 1960. Nearly 20 night flights (from dusk to dawn) through numerous localities from Thunder County and the Mount Shasta region (about 180 miles north of San Francisco) reported UFOs at various times and of various descriptions: round, bright, metallic UFOs glowing a reddish-purple fluorescent type of light, cigar-shaped UFOs trailing a long fiery exhaust, oval UFOs with red lights at each end and white lights showing at the window. Radar-equipped UFOs like a flying railroad car with flashing red lights at each end and white lights showing at the window and radar scopes were reportedly plagued with phantoms, as the state was apparently invaded by a whole fleet of patrolling saucers. The important factor in these sightings was the weather; prolonged and extensive temperature inversions prevailed in the area all that week. From southern Oregon through northern California.

FINAL GALLEY PROOF

Galley 94--THE WORLD OF FLYING SAUCERS
Formal multiple inversions of 3 to 36 degrees occurred nightly. Under certain conditions, practically any light shining into the sky will be projected as a mirage and to perform weird antics. Determining what was the actual source of specific phenomenon is almost impossible.
Authenticating factors, certain heavenly bodies made their own contribution to the excitement. Most of the objects observed last night and watched for periods of one to three hours or more, seemed to have moved off the earth or Alekarian or the planet Mars.
Some of the most spectacular sightings were those reported from Red Bluff the nights of August 13-14. Two highway patrolmen were chasing a speeding motorcycle when, at about 11:30 P.M. P.D.S.T., they saw what they at first supposed to be a brilliantly lighted aircraft falling directly toward them, jumping out of their car, they watched its descent and then it shot upward into the eastern sky. The performance continued for more than two hours. Because of this, the the Air Force base at Red Bluff was notified, and a crew of several officers who were witnesses watched and set up photoelectric cells to record the phenomenon. They determined that the UFO first noticed by the patrolmen was probably the star Capella, which at Red Bluff is circumspolar. It rose at 10:50 P.M. and at the time of the sighting was about 47 degrees above the horizon. About an hour later (12:48 A.M.) Mars, rose also in the northeast and close behind it (1:35 A.M.) came the bright star Aldebaran, which made a striking pair with Mars. With these brilliant heavenly bodies just above the horizon, on a night of fantastic multiple inversions of temperature and humidity, the only surprising fact is that the number of UFOs reported was not larger.

A person who has never been lucky enough to see a good mirage may feel skeptical about the phenomenon. But those who have encountered a spectacular example--for example, the Chicago sky line projected upside-down above Lake Michigan--know how startlingly real it can seem. When the source of the mirage is not apparent, the displayed image can seem mysterious and even frightening, as to many UFOs.

Near midnight, August 13, 1960, Red Bluff (Calif) police officers CHARLES A. CHASE and STANLEY SCOTT watched an oblong object with red and white side lights hovering in the eastern sky directly ahead. Among its characteristics: silent hovering, rapid and acute maneuverability, lights incapable of identification as any known aircraft. 

The officers, keeping a watch which lasted more than two hours, radioed a local Air Force radar station and got a swift, startled reply: "unidentified." Civilian authorities with calm powers of observation expected law enforcement officers watched the object—occasionally beaming its lights to the ground—until it vanished below the horizon.

On August 13 at Corning, California where police officers chased a red-lighted UFO for 2 hours the following was reported: Twice the unknown machine approached the police car, one of its red lights beaming the ground like a searchlight. One policeman swung their searchlight upward, and the descending UFO swerved away. Throughout the encounter, a static-like roar drowned the police radio. In the meantime radar screens at the nearby Air Force Base at Red Bluff, California reported a good "hard return" of the unknown on their screens, which indicated a solid object in the vicinity.

SAUCER "FLAPS" IN CALIFORNIA: The incident described on page 12 seems to have been one of the most interesting waves of UFO sightings on record. At least 20 people saw a large, dull grey, metallic-looking object, variously described as 60 to 80 feet in diameter. It was hovering above some trees at an estimated height of 500 to 800 feet. One of the witnesses, a well-known businessman, at least 20 people saw a bright light, a metallic gray object and some greenish lights around the craft. The object made no sound and moved very fast. The entire sighting lasted about 1 minute.  
The object came into view from the east and after making a horizontal flight of about 2 miles at a constant speed and about 600 feet altitude, it disappeared suddenly. One of the witnesses stated that at one time blue and white lights were displayed and diving at tremendous speed. They were dazzling and as they descended, the craft came closer so that the size could be estimated more accurately. The duration of the sighting was about a half minute. The observers stated that the craft was tilted at an angle and the motion was like a disc which seemed to be spinning. All of the witnesses were highly reliable. Most of them are business and professional people, and some are former military personnel.

PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
CONCLUSIONS
During the past 20 years, a total of 12,618 reports of unidentified flying objects have been received by the Air
Force. Of this total, 11,917 have been analyzed and either identified or are considered to require no further analysis.
The remaining 701 reports are considered to be "unidentified".

The percentage of reports considered to be "unidentified" has steadily decreased from about 25% in 1952
to about 6% at the present time.

The evidence contained in the reports indicates that most UFO sightings can be explained as misidentifications
of known objects or phenomena. However, a few cases remain which cannot be explained as such. These
cases tend to have unusual characteristics, such as high speed, unusual maneuvers, and lack of sound,

Although a few reports seem to defy explanation, extensive studies indicate that these cases do not provide
evidence of visitors from other planets. There is no convincing evidence that unidentified flying objects are
extraterrestrial vehicles.

Based on the factors of speed, flight path, appearance, and lack of sound, a few cases have been classified
as "unidentified". The lack of physical evidence or data precludes satisfactory explanation of these cases.

The Project BLUE BOOK staff has carefully reviewed all the unidentified cases, and further analysis is not
considered likely to provide positive identification.

The Air Force does not have any evidence indicating that the objects classified as "unidentified" represent
technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientific knowledge.

There is no evidence that the unidentified flying objects constitute a security threat to the United States.

Amazon & scary thought of the past - the scene Arose at the time 1959 - this was undoubtedly seen in 1958 - My wife saw it and carefully lead my eye to it; insisted I must see it - it measured generally about 25 feet in diameter and was hovering 25 to 30 feet above the ground and ahead of us in the area - Littleton, Colorado.
When this object came into my area from the north, I thought it was an aircraft below the clouds or
a low flying plane. But then I looked more carefully and saw that it was not an aircraft or anything I was familiar with. It was quite steady, perfectly still, and bright - some kind of luminous whitish color. There were no lights or openings on the object - it appeared as a uniformly lighted round object, higher and larger than a normal aircraft. After several minutes it slowly moved westward, maintaining its great altitude, and simply disappeared out of sight - no sound, no vapor trails, just disappeared. My little story has remained firmly in mind and has been a curiosity over the years.

TEHAMA COUNTY
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTAL CRIME REPORT
1960 4:00 P.M.

"More Objects In Sky?
New Reports Are Made"
In Mineral Tehama County, Deputy Sheriffs at Mineral Lodge reported that they received several reports during the day of bright lights and unidentified flying objects being seen across the sky. According to J. Gonzales, who is the Manager at the Mineral Lodge, "Up to the present" the "Manager received about three daily reports of such objects being seen." Gonzales stated that all UFO appearances were also reported to the Air Force Office at Red Bluff.

"The tree lines from the Lodge indicate that the objects were visible for a long distance" and some observers said the lights were 'very erratic in motion and changing colors". The objects were seen during the daytime as high as 20,000 feet, according to observers. Gonzales also said the objects were picked up on radar at the Red Bluff Air Force weather station. Law enforcement agencies throughout the County received a number of reports of the sightings.
Perry and Gonzales said the objects moved at high speed and made abrupt turns, which they said would be impossible for any conventional aircraft. Alton Brown and a Mrs. Carlson both reported seeing the objects and both gave similar descriptions.
They said the objects appeared as "whitish and red lights" that seemed to "hover and dart" across the sky. No other details were reported.

Gonzales said that in his opinion it was not possible for the objects to have been conventional aircraft. He would estimate the speed of the objects to have been around 1,000 mph. However, he could not make any definite statement as to what the objects actually were.

At 1:45 a.m., 16 August 1960, Sgt. ****** *******'s attention was called to a strange light in the S.E. sky by a neighbor. He observed a large, bright, round, white light which appeared to be about 35-40 feet in diameter. The light appeared to be located a short distance above the horizon, moving slowly in a SW direction. After observing the light for about 3-4 minutes, it suddenly disappeared.

Sgt. ******* reported this incident to the USAF Project Blue Book Office. According to Sgt. ****** "the light was brighter than the evening star, and was definitely not a star or planet. Also, it was moving in a horizontal direction, not rising or setting as a star or planet would do."

Feals positive that the original conclusion is that as stated above.
In instances where people say that they start driving toward the object that is a great distance away, it always gives you the impression of its being close with you without accurate estimate equipment. The angular variations are such too small for them to cover.

At approximately 7:30 p.m., on August 8, 1960, near Littleton, Colorado. They observed a bright light, round in shape, approximately 10-15 feet in diameter, at an estimated height of 1,500 feet above the ground. 

The light made a slight humming sound, and seemed to oscillate or emit a pulsating light. It was observed for a period of approximately 2 minutes, and then suddenly disappeared. The witnesses stated that the object did not seem to just go out, but rather appeared to accelerate at a high rate of speed and was gone in an instant.

UFO SIGHTING RED BLUFF, CALIFORNIA 
13-20 AUGUST 1960

Radio KBLF interview of officers _____ and _____ of highway patrol, Red Bluff, office. 

Saturday night, approximately 11:50, almost midnight.

Where did you first spot the unidentified flying object? East of Corning (?) about 4 miles East of Corning to be exact.

You were on the Hoag (?) road where the people know the area around here, right? Now what you spotted, we have had a lot of talk and people have called it different things and everything else, 30-some-odd years back, what way possible, Mr. Scott, if you could more or less identify what it is I would like from you, someone who were this time.

At first we thought it was an airliner coming down and after looking closer at it and stepping out of the car, we realized that it was not a conventional type aircraft. It was surrounded by a bright halo, a glow of light, and it was moving from the west going to the east, across the center of it, and on each end there was a red light which would sweep the countryside as the object turned. At pointed out the red light in the direction.

How many people were in the car with you at the time?

It is hard to say, not knowing the size of the object, it is possible that we were as close as a mile and a half to two miles at the closest.

Something I asked this afternoon, I'll ask him again: But right now, do you say, like to see your first feeling when you first saw this object? At first, I didn't have any feeling until the object had performed a few maneuvers and then the idea formed a few minutes and then it appeared to be coming straight toward the patrol car. At that time, I did get scared and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. 

Well, I did feel some just curiosity or shock, like you say? Well, I did feel fear just one time when it first started toward us and after that, it was more curiosity. We were then trying to find out what it was.

Well, to your own idea now, Mr. Scott more or less explained what it looked like-once again it looked like it had either a row of lights or a row of windows on the side of the object, is this right? Yes, it appeared to be windows. The windows were only visible when the object would turn at a certain angle to us. It appeared to have to manipulate the machine in order to get this beam to sweep.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Littleton, Colorado
Date (Local): 20 Aug 60
Hour (Local): 19:55
Hour (Z Time Group): 2:12 ZULU 20 Aug 60
Satellites: (Det 5 ATIC, Ext 3279) -
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc) -
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4B1): N/A
Natural Phenomena (Hail, Lightning, etc) -
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc. -
Other: Insufficient data
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Changes
Analysis and Conclusions: The object was in view for 30 to 30 minutes with very little apparent or no motion, which appeared to be low altitude. The object gave off a blue-green light or color at times, which occasionally flashed, and remained stationary most of the time. The object appeared to get closer at one point, giving the impression it may have been a large balloon. However, the lack of detailed description and the lack of movement make it difficult to confirm this possibility. Another possibility is that it was a satellite in orbit. There is insufficient information to determine the exact nature of the observed object.

I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

in the sense that the beam wasn't movable in itself, that the entire object had to move to move the beam light--this fixed light. This fixed light, was this one and the same or less the rear of the ship?
We only saw one beam in operation at a time but both red lights on the front and rear or sides, however the case may be, were always visible. 
Would you say it was round? The light or the object? 
No, the object itself.
The object was round--someone would say a flying saucer--that is what it looked like?
Yes, that's right.
And it was supposedly hovering over the ground at a certain altitude for a certain length of time. In that area?
That's correct, quite considerable lengths of time it hovered over the ground and appeared motionless.
Well, you know a lot of people have been talking about weather balloons and illusions and so forth, and how there might be two members of the California highway patrol who saw something the other night. Something that's the big thing we want to point out. And, in checking with the San Francisco city area--there were two balloons let out with red and white lights but these balloons were not in the area where we had the instance, no, if anyone had them.
And something else, too, is the fact that you or Mr. Scott put the red light on the object. Just what happened then? We'll, when the object moved away from us, and we followed it in the patrol car at which time we lost sight of it. We stopped after several miles and got out of the patrol car and as I recall, we climbed on the hood of the car to look over a knoll. There it was, the object still right up above us.
It was hovering about a mile away. At this time it appeared to be about a mile away.
Well, was saying earlier that at one time it was behind the hill, and all of a sudden it seemed to jump over the hill. That was the time. It appeared a lot closer that what it was.
How big would you say the object was? As large or larger than an airliner. Could you say on foot approximately? About 150 to 200 feet.

- page 88 -

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document containing text related to a UFO sighting report from Project Blue Book.

Here is the text from the document:

How close would you say that you ever got to the flying object? Well, like we said, not knowing the exact size of the object and just judging from the sighters, we couldn't get too much of an extremely accurate—it would be a guess, but we figure anywhere from a half mile to a mile and a half.

Well, let's see, in your own thoughts, naturally in your own opinion? What is your own opinion? Not in the slightest. I wouldn't even care to form an opinion. I would like to know what it is, still amazed!

This was Saturday night. We heard reports too, that it was also sighted near reports by residents in the area and it seems to be coming back to the same spots. Do you think there might be a possible change that would refuse to come back to the same spot sometime in the future? Well, could be, right?

Well, after all this night's work, Mr. Scott, what was your feeling after you had heard of course, on newspapers and magazines about people who spotted such objects and people saying things about them? How did you feel yourself, especially after you reported this to the high-way patrol office? Well, I was of course, thankful for the fact that there were other officers from different agencies that assist, plus residents of the area and people traveling through because myself—I don't think it had seen something before would have been pretty confused.

(Who Objects?): You and a couple of prisoners from the jail and some city police plus some residents from the area. It would really be quite a think to come across some thing like this. Were you in the area on a regular routine patrol? We were the only car in the county that night and we were covering the entire county.

After you had come across this think, you reported it to the highway patrol office? Yes, we reported it despite the sheriff's office. We don't have a dispatcher here all the time. They in turn sent down the stuff, was that the idea?

Yes, that is what they did.

You say then it was more of a saucer shape than a cigar shape? The way you described it this afternoon, it could be either one, and not getting the full view of the underside of the thing or never having the machine turn cross ways in front of us.

- page 89 -

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a handwritten or typed document. 

The text in the document is as follows:

(would be) difficult to say even in the daytime--you could not determine whether it was round or oblong.

Well, do you say this, that maybe perhaps it knew of your presence, there especially with this red light on? 
because it might believe it was looked at and the person of the light became involved and the thing was not a craft. As officer Scott brought the red light on, it moved directly away from us.
Well, then it did move away slowly or did it move away slowly or
did it do this all at once, with speed? 
Sight became lost, nothing more could be seen, it moved so swiftly that we lost sight of it totally.
Then, like it did not notice the red light and it was leaving the area. Then it did return after you put the red light out.
It came back towards us on one other occasion.
What is your feeling, how do you feel about the whole situation, I see how do you. If is it rather difficult to believe even after watching, it was amazing to sit out there for two hours and fifteen minutes watching this thing, and it is even more difficult to tell someone else what you saw, it is quite an experience.

That is all you could say about it.
So, if someone would say to you that they felt you saw a balloon or an optical illusion, what would you say?
I would say that I wish that person had been sitting where I was and had seen the same. scene. 
That's right, it was definitely not a balloon or optical illusion, I can see what you mean.

Well, there it is. In other words, we have an unidentified flying object, maybe never again. This is in the area on highway 99 E and as a guess it was approximately 200 feet (sq ft) in diameter, and had weird lights and so forth, and however over the ground it did not appear to be an optical illusion: it was there.

Well, I know you would like to say anything to sort of wrap this up. I know you have been driving along and both Mr. Scott and Mr. Carson have been with the wire service and the investigators all day, and now I have come concerned with information here from this experience through the press and from something else, what do you think of it now?

Oh, I think with the press it was quite an experience, I think most of the reporters and people we talked to were quite impressed due to the number of creditable people that saw the thing. I do feel sure if this had been, I would have some support and I was there by myself before it arrived.

The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text.

Isn't it true that someone in the area at the time traveling through called in somewhere and reported more or less, confirming your reports of the same object? Yes, two people from San Francisco called today to report that they had seen the object in the area at that time as they were passing through on highway 80 E.

How many people would you say saw the object that you know of? We have no idea. There was at least 5 or 6 of us at that time. However, the people we talked to within 24 hours of reporting that they also saw the object. Of course, this happened and we were talking to some of the residents of the area and they said too that the also spotted the object. (narrator)

Well, gentlemen, since time is running out I would like to take the opportunity to say thanks for a day's work with press and with the office work and so forth. I would like to thank you a lot for taking the time and coming out here. To me this is a fantastic story. I think it is just fabulous and like you said, "I am glad you weren't in alone because it I were in the position I would feel the very same way." 

We have officer Scott and officer Carson here. Highway Patrol, Red Bluff Office.

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

Officer and I were on Hoog Road, east of Corning looking for a speeding motorcycle when we saw what at first appeared to be two small airliners dropping from the sky. The objects appeared to be slowing and seemed to be in trouble. We observed them for about 2 minutes and leaped from the patrol vehicle in order to get a better position to watch. As we got out of the car the first thing we noticed was a mist clearing in the objects beginning to he an aircraft crash. Suddenly the objects shot straight up out of sight. We continued to watch until the objects were probably within 1,000 ft. of the ground and suddenly zoomed straight up and apparently left the vicinity.

There the objects stopped, at this time it was clearly visible to both of us and was undoubtedly not an aircraft of any known design. Families nearby were attracted by the slow hinking the ground or on the sides, or such side of the objects emitting orange or reddish lights. The objects lit up in this manner. We estimated the objects to be approximately 20 to 25 feet in diameter with a light colored or metallic finish, and the color varied during the observation. There the object descended rapidly and as it approached the ground the lights went out. We did not see the object again.

At this time we radioed Tehama County Sheriff's office requesting that they contact local radar bases. They advised us later that the nearest base at Beale AFB could find no radar contact during the time we were observing the objects.

Officer and myself, after our verification continued to watch the objects. On two occasions the object came directly towards the automobile, as it approached the object turned, swept the area with a huge red light. Officer observed the object though the red light and can verify the appearance of the object. We observed the object use the red beam approximately 6 or 7 times, sweeping the sky in various directions and we followed. We proceeded to the base where we were able to locate the object. As it moved away from us to the south, it moved near the first object and both stopped. The lights went out and that was the last time we observed them.

Finally both objects disappeared below the eastern horizon. We returned to the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office and met Deputy Sheriff Gooch and met Deputy Sheriff Hesse, who had been to Los Molinos and clearly described to us what we had seen. The night jailer also was able to corroborate the subject and its maneuvers exactly as we had seen them. 

The objects were about 1950 hours and observed for about 15 minutes. During this time there was experienced radio interference.

We submit this report in confidence for your information, we were chinh after our initial shock and decided to observe and record all we could of the objects.

REPORT ON FLYING OBJECTS, TEHAMA CO.

On Monday, August 3, 1959 at approximately 9:05 PM at the Tehama County Jail there was heard and felt two loud booms. The on-duty Jailer received a radio report from the Corning Police Dept. that there was a ball of fire falling from the sky. The on-duty officer appeared to be the following: 
On Officer Halliday reported to have seen the object coming and Officer Martinez and another officer also saw the object. 
Officer Halliday reported this to the California Highway Patrol Officer on duty at Red Bluff, as the falling object was thought to be a Aircrast or some sort and if reports from the above was neg. as to any of our Air Craft and no Fires.

On 8-3-1959 at about 11:30 PM another call came in about a flying object in the Tehama and Sheriff's Office and stated that they watching a flying object.

At 12:00 midnight this Officer and Officer Farst went to Los Molinas and saw a small object fly past them going fast, named Lt. Campbell called Blueberry Hill and at approximately 12:30 AM of 8-4-59 observed again the object they had seen and others in the eastern sky, they were traveling southwest and at times they would go straight up or down, one of the objects seem to stop and hover over the Red Bluff area. After a short time there was a 1 object seen going from the North to the South. 
On 8-4-59 at approximately 10:10 PM went out side of the radioei that he had picked up information that a object in the Los Molinas area had landed twice to the east of Los Molinas, on checking out side of the Jail observed a object committee in from the west to a position to the South East of the Jail appeared to stop and hover for a moment, and after a few seconds started to come out side and observe the flying object, but by the time they drove up arrived the Object was gone but was spotted in the north west by Mr who stated when the Object was hovering and it looked like a large ball and had a glow on it and two white blinking lights appeared along its in three or four planes which may have been windows or ports. The Object then took of in a southerly direction and passed out of sight with out any further bearing any type of motor sound found that the firing Object came and he stated that the object was West of Corning.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, describing an unidentified flying object sighting that occurred on 5 August 1960 between Moulis & Lille, France.

The text of the document is as follows:

"NO CASE (Information Only)

NEAR-LANDING. IN FIELD, one of the closest sightings in a long time occurred at Moulis & Lille, in France. It was seen by about 15 persons from a village. A square object of about 8-10 meters in diameter, which was very bright, round, red in color, and flew very slowly apparently for about 1 minute and from 30 to 70 meters high. The object descended to about 100 feet from the ground, and then rose again and flew away toward the north. The object seemed to give off a very bright light, and sometimes the light was reflected by the ground. The form was apparently square with a rounded top, and in the lower part there were some kind of black signs or designs. The object flew with a very slow and level flight, and there were no other witnesses."
