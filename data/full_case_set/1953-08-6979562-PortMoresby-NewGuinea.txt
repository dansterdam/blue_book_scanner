Unidentified Aircraft Sighting
12:00 hours 24 August, 1953

This is to confirm a verbal statement made by the Superintendent of Air Navigation to you on 24 August, 1953.

2. Mr. [REDACTED] reports as follows:
On 24 August, 1953, around 12:00 hours, he noticed a cloud building up in the vicinity of the Marine Base Workshops, Port Moresby. This cloud rapidly grew much larger, as though a southerly direction from Port Moresby, at a very great height.

3. Whilst this cloud, which grew in intensity for several minutes, was gradually diminishing in volume side as and assuming a much larger size, it appeared to take on the shape or possible form of some object, as it appeared slightly larger than the usual type of cloud formations. There was a very clearly defined vapour trail behind it until it finally disappeared with a rapid gain of altitude.

4. I had my movie camera with me and photographed the whole thing on the telephone lines. In an endeavour to ascertain what the object might have been, it appeared to me to be some type of very high speed aircraft.

As far as I know, Air Traffic Control knew of no aircraft movements in that area, and in any case, from the attitude of the object, it certainly could not have been a civil aircraft.

Weather conditions at the time were cloudless*.

Unidentified Aircraft Sighting
1200 HOURS, 24 AUGUST, 1953

This is to confirm a verbal statement made by the Superintendent of Air Navigation to you on 24 August, 1953.

2. Mr. reports as follows:

"At 1200 hours on 25 August, 1953, a circular object was observed in the vicinity of the Marine Workshops, Port Moresby, when a cloud building up suddenly in roughly a south-westerly direction from Port Moresby, at a very great height.

I watched this cloud, which grew in intensity for several minutes. Suddenly it opened, and in the centre I saw what appeared to be the shape or possible size of this object, as it appeared slightly larger than the cloud. But whatever it was, it soon disappeared in a very cloudy defined vapour trail behind it until it finally disappeared with a rapid gain of altitude."

I had my movie camera with me and photographed the whole thing on the telescope lense. I am waiting the results of the photograph to ascertain what the object might have been. It appeared to me to be some type of aircraft, high powered and of unusual configuration.

As far as I know, Air Traffic Control knew of no aircraft movements in that area, and in any case, from the extreme altitude of the object, it could not have been a civil aircraft.

Weather conditions at the time were cloudless.

To do not know of any operational performance implying this observation operating in this area at the time.

This is to confirm a verbal statement made by the Superintendent of Air Navigation to you on 24 August, 1953.

2. Mr. [redacted] reports as follows:

"At 1200 hours on Sunday, 23 August, 1953, I was in the vicinity of the Marine Base, Torokina, when my attention was attracted by a cloud formation which was forming in a Southerly-Southwesterly direction from Port Moresby. The cloud, as it grew larger, gave the appearance of some type of aircraft, and I watched it intently for several minutes, as it appeared to be stationary and difficult to identify very clearly. It could have been a normal type of cloud formation, but the peculiar manner in which it was forming, and the fact that it remained almost stationary, caused me to continue to watch it. I was unable to determine its exact nature, as it suddenly disappeared with a rapid gain of altitude."

I had my movie camera with me and photographed the whole thing on the selephone, but am unable to ascertain what the object might have been. It appeared to me to be some type of very high speed aircraft or other type of object which moved at incredible speed.

As far as I know, Air Traffic Control knew of no aircraft movements in that area, and in any case, from the extreme altitude of the object, it certainly could not have been a normal aircraft. Whether conditions at the time were "cloudy" I am not certain.

To the best of my knowledge, there was no aircraft of the Australian services in that area at the time.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
(Unclassified) JAG NO. 54-54
COUNTRY: Papuauda
SERIAL NO.: IR-32
SUBJECT: Unidentified flying object
AREA REPORTING ON: Port Moresby, New Guinea
DATE OF REPORT: 27 August 1953
PREPARED BY (AGENCY): Captain Ruppelt, USAF
EVALUATION: 4-6
SOURCE: 1st Lt. Norman B.Jenner

SUMMARY: (Narrative should be couched in summary paragraph. Last sentences all known to be true. Begin text of report on AF Form 112—Part II.)

At approximately 1330 hours, 26 August 1953, 1st Lt Norman B. Jenner, 54th Fighter Bomber Squadron, was on a routine training flight over the area of Port Moresby, New Guinea, when he observed a bright, shiny, metallic-like object in the sky. The object appeared to be disc-shaped and was at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet. Jenner immediately called the tower at Kila Airfield to confirm his sighting. The tower operator and other personnel also observed the object. The object was approximately 30 inches in diameter, disc-shaped, and was moving at an extremely high rate of speed. It appeared to pulsate or throb at intervals. Jenner watched the object for several minutes as it moved about the sky. At one point, the object stopped and hovered briefly, then accelerated and disappeared rapidly in a straight line. Jenner stated that the object gave off a bright metallic glow and moved in a manner unlike any known aircraft. There had been no other aircraft in the area at the time.

Jenner is a very reliable observer and his sighting was confirmed by other personnel. It is the opinion of this Command that the object observed was an unidentified flying object. There is no other explanation that can be given for this sighting.

There had been no other balloons or aircraft reported in the area within two (2) hours prior to the sighting. Nor did the object conform to the flight characteristics of any known aircraft.
