August 19, 1964

Dear [Redacted],

Project Blue Book Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has evaluated the UFO sighting you recently reported.

The observation contained in your report is possibly explainable. The sighting was of a high altitude aircraft contrail, which had just set off while the sun was low on the horizon, producing a temporary effect of brilliance that may have suggested a UFO.

Also, it is not likely that a balloon or similar aircraft could have produced the observed maneuvers and attitudes to the extent that was described. The object was visible for only about 15 minutes. This represents about the normal time that condensation trails from high altitude aircraft remain visible.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
MAJOR, USAF
Public Information Division

ATTN OF: TDEW

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information (Meredith Williams)

TO: HQ USAF SAPOI FB (Mrs. Geiser)

1. We have received a report from Mr. D. G. xxxxxxx, an observation of a n unidentified flying object on 21 April 1964. Mr. D. C. xxxxxxx has requested that this report be made available to you.

2. The information contained in his report indicates that the unidentified flying object was observed by several persons near Washington, D.C. for approximately 30 minutes. The object had just set while the ground light condition was dusk. The object could not be identified as any known type of aircraft or military vehicle nor could it be attributed to the constant speed, erratic flight, and duration of observation. Also the object made no sound as observed.

FOR THE COMMANDER

YOU - THE NUCLEUS OF SECURITY!

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Yes with the brilliant star of the West. Disappeared while adjusting telescope - could not relocate it.
15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.
16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? (Circle One) Yes No Don't Know. If you answered YES, then tell what.
17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object: a. Sound - b. Color - brilliant star - white
18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object such as color, size, number, etc., comparing the object with something with which you are familiar. The shape is hard to make out with look scrutiny as it was instantaneous and appeared as a transparent globe having one or two bright highlights - almost overhead (about 80Â°).

The image contains a sketch that appears to be a smooth, satellite-like motion. The witness has described it as a "Smooth, satellite-like motion".

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, or "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
Smooth, satellite-like motion

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Only one

Transcribed text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 17 July 1964
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
