DATE: 8 February, 1956

I left St. Louis Lambert Field at dusk January 5 with my passenger, Louis Lambkin. We climbed VFR to 5000 and flew SW. We were using Omni Range stations. At a speed about 160-175 MPH abeam Terre Haute, Terre Haute, Tom (can't explain) called this object below us in flying saucers? I'd passed it off and didn't even listen. This time I saw a very bright intermittent light that at first appeared to be a jet. But the light just seemed to stop and then start again like a jet but stationary. First reaction was that another aircraft was passing us very close above us, nearly lighting. Seconds later it was gone. Nothing to judge by - no horizon. We were at West Cook Airport. It was called Indianapolis radio and asked what that light might have been. Over Chicago called me and said "Glad you asked what that light was, I'm over Chicago and I saw it just like you described and it just disappeared." It seems the object was in the air because we had to be on the ground, at least 24,000 feet altitude, to see it.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing a brightness comparison at Indianapolis, where someone was opening a gas station or supermarket and had several of those portable strobe-producing lights. The document mentions that in contrast, they were candles in brightness. It also suggests that if this is Army photographic equipment, similar high intensity lighting sure would help on low visibility approaches on dark foggy nights.

For brightness comparison - at Indianapolis someone was opening a gas station or super market or something and had several of those portable strobe producing lights. In contrast, they were candles in brightness. 

Another point I had not thought of - after the light went out, or disappeared. I did not see any aircraft position lights. Suggestion: If this is Army photographic equipment, similar high intensity lighting sure would help on low visibility approaches on dark foggy nights.

DATE 9 Feb, 1956

2 dry 34 Louis Paumley Field at about 4:30p.m. with my wife, we observed VFR a 5000 rpm OBJECT in the air coming from the West & hovering about 10 miles toward the North & descending to a point near the Horizon then would start to climb again - This object was disc-shaped with a red top & a bright light on bottom & about the size of a pie plate & seemed to do a "Yo-Yo" movement about 10 miles from our position & would stay in view for about 1 minute at a time then disappear & reappear - while it was there it remained absolutely motionless - there is a an other OBJECT in the air that was moving very close to this one & was much larger in size and shape in the form of a torpedo which would remain in view for only a few seconds at a time.

This document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be handwritten text describing a UFO sighting or report.

Transcribing the text:

Was made shortly after dark and very definitely CAR was calling police and we were over 2/3 called me and said " had you noticed when (they) lights was over there about 2:30 and 12 to 1:00 and 1:30 and 2:30 AM" It amazed me for it was fact it the lights where on the ground the pilot in close by and seemed to come up. The object was 28 to 30 feet in diameter, The pilot in the jet seemed to be distracted or watching, for he was flying in level flight and seem to stay at the same height. 

For brightness comparisons - a Neon sign would not show as bright. It was a little larger than a 50 gallon oil drum. It seemed to be some 1000 ft off the ground and on the bright side of a hill The pilot was westbound The object was white or silver on the top and the bottom seem to be about the same color. The pilot never did fire his jets.

From indications conversation afterwards it seems that one of the city police cars or an army vehicle stationed at the base some 15 miles east of Indiapolis were on the roads over the area at the time. The pilot did not seem very disturbed nor did he alter his course.

My dear Colonel Evans:

My face as read: The day before that meeting I got out my log book. The year changed in the middle of this page, the dates were 1955- and in the middle began 1956. Consequently, my sighting of the previous report was on the night of January 5 that year. Try again and see what you come up with.

Very truly yours,

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT

SECTION
PART 1

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
This analysis of the Air Force's investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects was prepared for the Air Force by the Battelle Memorial Institute under Project Blue Book.

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REPORTED UFO SIGHTINGS
1. The reported data on sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 through 1952 has been analyzed statistically. The data are taken from the files of Project Blue Book, the Air Force's official investigative agency for UFO reports.
2. During this 6-year period, a total of 1,593 reports of UFO sightings were received and investigated by Project Blue Book. The 1,593 reports included in this analysis represent all known reports received and processed by the Air Force during this period.
3. The principal purposes of this statistical analysis are:
a. To determine the reliability of the reported data.
b. To determine the consistency and validity of the reported data.
c. To determine the distribution of sightings by location, time, and other factors.
d. To determine the characteristics of the reported UFOs.
e. To determine the reasons for the reported sightings.

RELIABILITY OF REPORTED DATA
4. Reliability of the reported data was studied by analyzing the degree of detail and consistency in the descriptions of the various sightings. A measure of the reliability of the reported data was obtained by examining the qualifications of the observers, the conditions under which the observations were made, and the specificity of the descriptions.

CONSISTENCY AND VALIDITY OF REPORTED DATA
5. Consistency and validity of the reported data were studied by analyzing the relationship between the various characteristics of the reported sightings. Particular emphasis was placed on determining the consistency between the descriptions of the UFOs and the stated reasons for the sightings.

DISTRIBUTION OF SIGHTINGS
6. The distribution of sightings was studied by analyzing the location, time, and other factors associated with the reported sightings.
