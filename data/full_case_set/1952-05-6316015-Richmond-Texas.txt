[The witness has drawn a sketch showing an elliptical object moving from left to right across the horizon with arrows indicating its motion.]
The witness described the object as flying the elliptical course very rapidly. It appeared to move silently, without sound. Generally several objects, up to 4, were following the first one. There were no vapor trails, smoke or exhaust visible. The object had no definite shape - just a bright glowing mass. The object was in view for about 3 to 4 minutes.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
[The witness has drawn a sketch showing an elliptical object with no distinct features.]
The object appeared as a saucer-shaped or football-shaped object. The object appeared to be metallic and was somewhat shiny. It was estimated to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter.

It was a young girl & her mother - saw the spacecraft at 9:30 p.m. - watched it for 10 minutes. The object was circular 40 or 50 feet across. [redacted]. The nights of 5/15/52 - other phenomenon. A brilliant light, a disc shaped object. All of these manifestations in the direct line northward - visual evidence - no physical trace at all of any nature - phenomena over a period of years. By the 7th do not still exist but many reports still go into district office - inconclusively. All these cases show there is something present over & above the usual planes. May interest the saucer group as they are all bona fide reports - not hoax or hallucination cases. The description of the object would tally with most reports. Daylight sightings should get more attention.
