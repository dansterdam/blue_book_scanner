MONDAY JUNE 14, 1954

GENTLEMEN:

I UNDERSTAND WE SHOULD REPORT "UNIDENTIFIED" OBJECTS. THIS HAPPENS TO EAST PASADENA, CALIFORNIA ON JUNE 13, 1954 AT APPROXIMATELY 9:00 P.M. WHILE VIEWING MY TELEVISION AND I SAW A RED FLASH IN THE SKY. GOING NEAR THE OBJECT, ABOUT THE SPEED OF AN AUTOMOBILE, THERE WAS A KIND OF LARGE BALL OF FIRE.

IT SEEMED TO HOVER AWAY FROM US. IT SEEMED TO BE GOING ALONG VERY QUIETLY. I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW ABOUT THIS. IT STAYED THERE FOR SOME TIME, THEN IT TOOK OFF AT A TERRIFIC SPEED, MOVE IT TOOK THAT STOP, MOVE THAT STOP.

IT WAS NO NOISE, AND IT TRAVELED AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED (POSSIBLY FOLLOWING IT?) 
IT SEEMED TO MOVE STRAIGHT AND IT LEFT A VAPOR TRAIL.

SINCERELY,
MRS. [REDACTED]
PASADENA, CALIFORNIA
