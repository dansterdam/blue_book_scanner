10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Roundish-silvery obj which appeared to be motionless in the western sky. In size it was
close to the diameter of the sun; however, 
not rnd, but oblong & at a 45° angle. After 
about 3 min, a thin white trail, about 1/4 
length of obj was noticed leading away fr obj 
in a parallel line. Shortly after this the obj 
began to move & disappeared into the clouds, 
climbing. Unlike vapor trail in that it was 
thin and fluffy. Went in house and got BX. 
Obj lost but appeared in clouds. Disappeared 
back into clouds.

11. COMMENTS
Obj possessed all the characteristics of an a/c w/the exception of the 
initial observation of being motionless. 
Obj was probably moving toward the 
witness or away fr him & gave the 
impression of being stationary. Contrail 
are often thin & fluffy. Evidence 
indicates that this was an a/c 
sighting.

Dear Gentlemen:

I am not sure as to what department 
handles U.F.O. sightings, therefore it is
my wish that you please refer this 
report to whom it may concern.

On the evening of July 5, 1959 at twilight
I noticed a reflective silver object which appear-
ed to be motionless in the western sky 
in size it was close to the diameter of the 
sun, however it was not round but dis-
tinctly oblong much like a fountain pen. 
As I watched, the object I noticed after the 
spacing of about 3 minutes that a thin white
trail about four times the length of the 
object was leading away from the object

in a paralled line. This white substance was
entirely unlike any jet vapor trail I have ob-
served. It is hard to explain the diffe r-
ence but it was perceptably different. For
one thing it was exceedingly thin and seem-
ed to have a fluffy appearance.

It was shortly after I noticed the trail
that if began to move. It was close to
some cirrus clouds and therefore I could judge
its movement which was steady and rapid.
Fearing that it would bee high out of I
ran into the house and found my pair
of 7 x 50 binoculars. through these I tried
to find the object again for about a half
a minute then it emerged from part of
the cirrus clouds and was perceptably accele-
ration in speed. It then passed into some
more clouds and then after this I was only
able to detect its reddish glow through
the clouds it entirely disappeared into the clouds.
When I first sighted it it was not hori-
zontal but about this [] I guess [] angle
it resumed this angle when it began to move
and appeared to be heading up toward
space and farther away from the Earth

Very cordially yours
[some name blacked out]
