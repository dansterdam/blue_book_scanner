UNCLASSIFIED

Incident #222 --- Furstenfeldbruck, Germany -- 23 November 1948

The tactics described by this object, if correct, and
the implied time in sight (long enough to call others to see it)
are strongly against an astronomical interpretation for the in-
cident.

The object might have been a balloon with a light on it.

```
No. 222, Winds aloft charts not available on this one. Object
sighted 2 1/2 hours after scheduled release time at which time it was
plotted by a radar DF station to be at 17,000. A short time later the
same station reported the object circling at 10,000, speed estimated at
between 200-500 M.P.H. Most likely not a balloon.

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, AMC/IXO,
dated 19 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and a first
indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents' summaries 173 through 233 have been checked
against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
and Weather Bureau. Conclusions based on this review are inclosed.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide To Investigation Of Un-
identified Aerial Objects" be changed as follows : Item 13, "Direction
of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and so that motion is
specified as the direction toward which the object appears to move.
"Relative to Radar Nettings" should include a statement of the type of
radar set used.

Incident: 23

at 2220 hours, local time, 23 Nov 18, C saw an object in the air directly east of Furstenfeldbruck at unknown altitude, It looked like a reddish star and was moving in a westerly direction across Munich turning slightly to the South-East and then South-East. Speed could have been between 200 and 500 MPH. Actual speed could not be estimated. C called Base Operations from his car and they notified Raccceard Er Station who reported nothing on the scope but stated they would look. Raccceard Station then called Base Operations to report an unidentified object 27,000 ft z top some 30 miles south of Munich. Later Raccceard Station called C back at to report that the object WSS climbing and was then believed to be at 10,000 ft altitude about 10 miles south of Munich and was circling. 

There were no F-80's (Jets) flying on this night.

Capt C (an F-80 pilot) is considered completely reliable and his facts stated above were verified by Capt C at the time of the sighting.

          1. The following report is submitted from information re-
ceived by this Officer from 1st Lt. ██████████, S-2 Officer,  
563th Fighter Group (Jet), this station.

          a. At 2320 hours, local time, on 23 November 1948,
Captain ███████, 23rd Fighter Squadron, saw an object in the
air directly east of FURSTENFELDBRUCK (M 49/Y 65) at an unknown
altitude. The object, observed by Capt. ████████ from the ground,
looked like a 90 lumen star and was moving in a Southerly direction
across MUNICH (M 49/Z 85), turning slightly to the South-East and
then South-East. The speed could have been between 300 and 500
MPH, though the actual speed could not be estimated according to
Capt. ████████.

          b. Capt. ███████ called FURSTENFELDBRUCK (M 49/Z 65) Base
Operations from █████ barracks and informed them of the sighting.
Base Operations then notified Rottenburg DF Station who stated that
they heard nothing on the scope but would look. Traceboard in Base
Operations BACK stated that they picked up an unidentified
object at 27,000 feet altitude, about thirty (30) miles south of
MUNICH. Traceboard later called Capt. ████████ at his barrack and
informed him that the object was climbing and was then observed
to be at 40,000 feet altitude, about forty (40) miles south of
MUNICH and was orbiting (circling).

          2. The weather conditions at this time (2320 local) were;
clear; a three-quarter moon shining; no cloud layers; visibility, 3 miles
with ground fog; winds aloft, from North 56 Kmos an hour.

          3. There were no P-80's (Jets) flying on this night.

          4. Both the █████████ and Capt. █████████████ reg-
ularily enlisted airman and are experienced.
