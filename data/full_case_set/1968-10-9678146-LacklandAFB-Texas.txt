Dear Sir:

Attributing this additional information to the above captioned address, I have been corresponding and contributing to the unidentified Fly object material that has been forwarded to Wright Patterson AF base.

That on January 15, 1967, I sent in the material, which consisted of a black disc and been transferred to Wright Patterson AF Base and I was advised that I send it to your department.

Just, all papers are included, together with his letter to the one on the subject of this visit in the third weekend in October 1966 and appears to be marking all documents to this package.

Furthermore, I will be more than welcome to assure you and will of course respond to your request if it will be of any help for your work with others and will be grateful for your name if it will be to your department.

Yours very sincerely,

The image contains a photograph of multiple circular objects described as "discs". The text accompanying the image provides a detailed description of the objects, their relative sizes, positions, and movements. However, the image does not contain any human faces, so I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals.

Introduction.
(1) Large disc, about six inches in diameter.
(2) Two smaller discs, about the size of a quarter.
(3) Seven smaller discs, below mother disc, and on different angles.

There were three performances, at these discs. The first being a flood pattern, a wave motion across the top of the mother disc, building up and diminishing again. They were there, and then they were no more, all in the twinkling of an eye.

PAUSE.
There was three phases of these discs - the first ones being in a smaller diameter, the larger one about six inches in diameter. On the right side of the mother disc, you could see very plainly three of the smaller discs, and on the left one of the smaller discs. This smaller disc was directly below the mother disc, and the others six inches away from her. This smaller disc was slowly going down the mother disc, and the others six inches away from her were going in a circle, the first they were there and then they were gone.

As of yet I am not certain as to this manifestation, was by their position.

Then I turned my eyes toward the mother disc. The two larger discs were emerging from the mother disc, and going - the relative same position as in the first phase, and turned the other way, and then they were gone.

FINALLY.
(This is my only possible conclusion.) Is it possible that these discs could be a jet pilot's technique or is it possible they could be some unkown scientific phenomena. If the former is the case, then the faster they appear, the faster they disappear, and they might have added the speed of the jet to the speed of the disc, to where it would be extremely fast disappearance. If the latter, I believe we have something hitherto unknown to science, and the people we should tell this too, are welcome to them, without further claim or proofs or money.

Yours very truly,

The image appears to contain a sketch or drawing of several circular objects, possibly depicting UFOs or unidentified aerial phenomena. The largest circular object is labeled "FIRST VIEW" and there are several smaller circular objects around it, with text annotations describing their characteristics. The image appears to be part of a document or report related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force investigation into unidentified flying objects.

FIRST VIEW
THESE SEVEN SMALLER OBJECTS WERE NOTICED SHORTLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER ENCOUNTERING LARGE OBJECT, WHICH MOVED AWAY MUCH FASTER THAN THESE OBJECTS. THEIR EXACT CAUSE AND NATURE IS UNKNOWN.

The image contains a series of hand-drawn diagrams and sketches depicting various circular shapes, some of which appear to be representations of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or other celestial phenomena. The diagrams are accompanied by handwritten notes and annotations.

OCTOBER 8. 1966, S.A. WAS ON GUARD DUTY. A BRIGHT LIGHT WAS OBSERVED IN THE SKY DRING THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING. THIS LIGHT MOVED ABOUT ERRATICALLY, AS IF UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL. IT MOVED SO FAST AND CHANGED DIRECTION SO RAPIDLY THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT. EACH GLOW WAS DEFINITELY PROPELLED FROM ONE POINT TO ANOTHER, AND THERE WERE SEVERAL OF THESE GLOWS OR OBJECTS OBSERVED BY THE WITNESS.

The image appears to be a photograph or diagram from an old UFO report document. It contains various sketched circular shapes and annotations. The central larger circular shape has annotations describing "these may be lights from ship" and other details. There are also several smaller circular shapes surrounding the central one, with annotations mentioning "same shape as above" and other notes. Overall, the image seems to depict some kind of UFO-related observations or analysis.

PHOTO ANALYSIS 
NOTES: CHARLES BLACK
THE PHOTO APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN AFTER I1AY 68
IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THE PHOTO MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM A MOVING VEHICLE AS THE MAJOR OBJECTS APPEAR SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, POSSIBLY DUE TO VIBRATION EFFECTS.
THE TWO MAJOR OBJECTS APPEAR TO BE "FLYING SAUCER-TYPE" CONFIGURATION AND APPEAR TO BE EMITTING SOME FORM OF LIGHT OR ENERGY. 
THE TWO SMALLER OBJECTS APPEAR TO BE MOVING AWAY FROM THE MAJOR OBJECTS AT GREATER SPEED.
BASED ON THE RELATIVE SIZES AND SEPARATION DISTANCES, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE TWO MAJOR OBJECTS ARE APPROXIMATELY 50-60 FEET IN DIAMETER AND SEPARATED BY ABOUT 1/4 TO 1/2 MILE DISTANCE.
THE TWO SMALLER OBJECTS APPEAR TO BE APPROXIMATELY 10-15 FEET IN DIAMETER.
THESE MAY BE LIGHTS FROM SHIP OR REFLECTIONS FROM SHIP COMPONENTS.
