The letter discusses a "flying object" that the writer claims to have seen, and requests that the recipient provide any information about this incident if possible.

Text from the document:

Dear Mrs. Eisenhower,
I was wondering if you could look up in the files of the White House anything about the sighting of a flying object on November 25, 1959 at 9:30 p.m. It happened on the sky over Bound Brook, NJ.
An unidentified flying object. The U.F.O. was a terrible sight of speed and a maneuver, direction and color and sound - and it ceased and landed north towards Raritan.
If you do know anything about this, please, if possible, reply to this letter.
Sincerely,
Bound Brook, NJ
