14 NOVEMBER 1956
MOBILE, ALABAMA

BY ROBERT SERLING 
UNITED PRESS STAFF CORRESPONDENT
WASHINGTON, D.C. - PILOT WHO ONCE DENOUNCED "FLYING SAUCERS" AS "BUNK" HAS REPORTED ENCOUNTERING A MYSTERIOUS UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT NEAR MOBILE, ALA.

CAPT. FULGHUM OF CAPITAL AIRLINES DESCRIBED THE INCIDENT IN A NATIONAL INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE COMMITTED TO AERIAL PHENOMENA. 

HE SAID THE OBJECT APPEARED "PERFECTLY ROUND" AND WAS PULSING BRILLIANT COLORS. LOTS OF PEOPLE. THOUGHT IT WAS TITLED "THE GIANT AIRLINERS STRUCK BY METEORS".

INVESTIGATOR WHO TOOK PLACE NOV. 14, 1956 SAID HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT MAN OR ANY MAN-MADE OBJECT WAS INVOLVED. HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A NEW TYPE OF BALLOON. 

HE SAID WHEN HE AND HIS CO-PILOT SPOTTED "WHAT WE THOUGHT AT FIRST WAS A METEOR" IT WAS DESCENDING RAPIDLY. BUT INSTEAD OF BURNING OUT, IT BEGAN A SERIES OF VIOLENT MANEUVERS. FASTER THAN ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT.  

HE SAID HE THOUGHT THE OBJECT MIGHT BE A JET FIGHTER. TURNING AWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THEN IT BEGAN A SERIES OF VERY SHARP TURNS, "MUCH SHARPER THAN ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT", ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATOR.  

HE SAID THAT THE OBJECT FINALLY BEGAN A SERIES OF VIOLENT MANEUVERS, SHARPER THAN ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT, AND SHOT OUT OF SIGHT. PRECISION FLIGHTS OF SEARCHLIGHTS FROM BELOW SUDDENLY PLAYED ON CLOUDS. BUT THIS WAS NOTHING REMOTELY RELATED TO THE OBJECT WHOSE BRILLIANCE OUTSHONE EVERYTHING. EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT WE SAW IT, I CAN'T GET OVER IS WHY IT DID NOT APPEAR ON OUR RADAR. IT MUST A REPLY UPWARD.

UFO ENCOUNTER CONVINCES AIRLINE CAPTAIN FORMER SKEPTIC
This remarkable encounter with a UFO, which took place on a flight from Redwing to Mobile, Alabama, represents one of the most startling incidents on record. The experienced airline pilot, Captain Hull, was widely known among his fellow pilots as a skeptic who scoffed at UFO reports.
In a 1953 article for THE AIRLINE PILOT entitled "The Skeptic," Captain Hull revealed his strong reluctance to accept the "supernatural" or "unnatural" explanations for UFO phenomena. His attitude was one of flat disbelief and he was convinced that all such sightings could be explained in mundane terms.
The present incident, however, has completely altered his views. While flying the same route over the Gulf of Mexico near Mobile, Alabama, Captain Hull was startled to see a brilliant light appear suddenly off the left wing of his plane. At first he thought it might be a reflecting surface on the windshield, but the rapidly expanding light soon dispelled this idea. It was a solid, metallic-appearing craft, about 40 to 50 feet in diameter, hovering motionless about 500 feet below the airliner. 
As the startled pilot watched, the craft began to move, accelerating with intense speed and disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. Captain Hull immediately radioed Mobile tower, asking if any other aircraft were in the area. The tower replied that no other planes were known to be in the vicinity. The captain then contacted Brookley Tower, but they also denied knowledge of any other traffic. 
At this moment, the UFO reappeared, this time hovering about a mile away. It was brilliantly lighted and seemed to be spinning or revolving. The captain said the object was "fantastic" in its speed and maneuverability. It would dart rapidly in one direction, then reverse its course and disappear, only to reappear seconds later in a completely different position. 
After several more minutes of this strange aerial display, the UFO suddenly shot straight up at an incredible rate of speed and was lost to sight. Captain Hull was left dumbfounded, his skepticism thoroughly shaken. As he remarked later, "I'm convinced that what I saw was no simple reflection or hallucination. It was a real, physical object of extraordinary capabilities."
This incident, together with other sightings reported by air crews along the Gulf coast, has caused renewed interest in the UFO problem. The U.S. Air Force, which has maintained a policy of official skepticism regarding UFOs, may be forced to re-evaluate its position in the light of such dramatic and well-documented encounters.

The text in the document states:

"CAPITAL AIRLINES' PILOTS SEE ACROBATIC NIGHT LIGHT
(The sighting which follows is of particular interest because it was made by an expert observer - a veteran airline pilot who was formerly extremely skeptical on the subject of flying saucers. In Oct. 1952) Captain John J. Barharts of Capital Airlines, on flight from Toronto to Washington, sighted an acrobatic light which he was able to observe easily for some 2 or 3 minutes with his permission. A slightly condensed excerpt from the letter to CSI President...)

On the night of November 11, 1956 I was flying a Viscount at high attitude from Los Angeles to Chicago. When we were about 80 miles west or slightly less from Needles, California, a brilliant light suddenly appeared at our altitude. At first I thought it was a brilliant meteor. We were flying south-southwest and it fell across the path from right to left, stopping at the top of the windshield, and I saw what we thought was a brilliant meteor. It did not diminish in size, as any meteor does when entering the denser layers of the earth's lower atmosphere. We watched it for at least 50 miles from Needles. It did not burn out, but suddenly made a sharp turn and went into the ground with a tremendous flash...

I immediately reported the incident to the Hobile Control Tower. "Bates Tower", this is Capital 77! Look out toward the north and east and see if you can see a strange light hovering in the sky..."

This text describes a UFO sighting by an airline pilot, including details about the object's appearance and behavior. The text appears to be an excerpt from a larger report on the incident.

Extracting the text from the document:

by this.
Towers called back, "Capital 77, we are trying to raise the Brockley signal."
Right at this moment the strange light began another series of crazy gyrations, they grew ever more fantastic, a sort of rhythmic, undulating cadence, the likes of which neither we nor had ever seen. Then, apparently coincident, the object had reached the climax of its brilliant rising at the most breathtaking angle and made a fantastic upward dash that diminished rapidly to a pinpoint and was swallowed by the clouds. 
This unearthly exhibition probably went on for at least two minutes, according to our best judgment. I glanced at the clock and noted it read 10:12.
The most puzzling thing about the encounter, aside from the dancing flight, was that the object, whatever it was, had remained at the same distance from us throughout the performance. It never increased in size, and yet we were bearing down on it at more than 5 miles a minute in the viscount. It is true that it was in view for only two minutes and performing in an ever more erratic series of maneuvers, but we could have had it nailed down by calculation, whereas it remained constant and the same distance away, no matter how it moved.
If you know southern Alabama, you know that it is pretty desolate country, with no cities or towns for miles. We were above the clouds, precluding any reflections of ground lights on clouds, and this was nothing remotely related. Likewise I am personally ruling out all devices (at least the ones we know) that have been launched within my ken. The one thing which I can't get over is the fact that when in company 2 I came strongly, powerfully impressed after my visual contact with this object that it was the most strange and odd thing I had ever witnessed on the earth!
We followed up on this spectacular sighting after landing at Mobile. The control tower operators had reached Brockley, and although a flight delay, but the controllers radar had not been energized at the time.
In case any of your members would like to know my background, you may give it to them. You will remember me as objectively skeptical and cynically critical of many pilots silly saucer sightings. I think you will agree I have been quite veteran and hard-boiled with 17 years of service, 15,000 hours and a million and a half miles as an airline pilot. But this I saw with my own eyes, and not a word has ever been printed about it until this moment.

SIGHTING REPORTS

November 16, 1956 - CSIL has received a confirmation of the observation by Miss -- of New Rochelle, that was reported in News Release #10. of 14 November 1956. The object seen is described as a large, shiny white object which appeared after 10 p.m. that night, hovering about a mile northeast, and moving "up and down and in other directions." It disappeared behind trees to the southeast, then came into view again for about 30 seconds. The object "was in view for about 10 seconds, changed color to yellowish-orange, maneuvered very slowly, and went out of sight again." The object appeared to have a dome on top and a row of lights around the bottom. Its size was sharply defined, the rear edge fuzzy, with a greenish-blue tail of light behind it. The object moved "in a fantastic manner", not like normal aircraft usually fly. She watched the object about 10:30 p.m., and her daughters also observed it. Undoubtedly these are the same objects that were described by Miss -- in the direction reported by Miss --, and the report by Miss -- appears to fit in quite well with the details.

24 November 1956
Dallas, Texas

Case #76: Dallas, Texas, Nov. 24. A bright light was observed about 6:15 p.m. by three witnesses, a housewife and two deputy sheriffs, according to the report. The object was described as brilliant, white, round, and about the size of a basketball. It was first sighted about 6:15 p.m., when it appeared to be about 300 yards distant and disappeared in the south. The object was seen for about 2 to 3 minutes and was observed by a neighbor. The object remained completely dark and emitted no other side of illumination. No sound was associated with the sightings.

Oscar Monnie, weather expert, tried to track down the sightings. He contacted the CAA at Love Field, Dallas, who stated they had no reports of any unusual aerial activity at that time. Radar at San Antonio and Abilene were also checked, but no returns were obtained. Monnie also contacted the Departments of the Army, Austin and San Antonio and the University of Texas, but no one had any knowledge of the sightings. The case is classified as U.F.0. Insufficient data is available to make a definite identification.

Case 272, Dallas, Texas, Nov. 24, 1956--Said the Dallas Morning News: "Residents at the Love Field control tower saw a brilliant fiery meteor" they thought was headed for them. "We sat there with our mouths open, wondering if it would hit Dallas. As it looked like it was coming down, it suddenly got very small and blipped out of sight." The phenomenon was first sighted about 6:13 a.m. by Ray Piper who described it as "like a big round ball. It was about 45' up in the sky, fell at an angle of about 20° and disappeared due south of Love Field." There was a loud noise like the falling of something heavy when it disappeared. The "tail" described as "at least 100 yards long, streaked across the sky and was completely dark." The center of the "tail" with long sparks shooting off the tail. The center of the tail completely dark. One side of the tail had a white and green fire streamed back as if blown back by a wind. The meteor streaked towards the earth, Oscar Monnie, meteoro expert, tried to track down the meteor and said that one was seen from Love Field must have been at least 5 seconds. He has been a big fellow with light for at least 15 seconds. The object at one point seemed to halt as if its end point was at least 150 miles south. Monnie had one report from a motorist 150 miles south between Austin and San Antonio and control tower personnel at Austin Municipal Airport also observed the meteor. Monnie said that meteors have a way of dropping into lightly settled land or wilderness and intelligence was guiding them under certain landings.

Case 274, Columbus, Ohio, Nov. 27, 1956 - Just for the record, another unexplained sighting. Reported the Columbus Dispatch, "A mysterious blast heard Tuesday morning by residents in the eastern and northeastern sections of the city through a flood of calls. A check with officials at local airports revealed the blast did not result from any locally based planes breaking the sound barrier. Investigators had not been able to determine what caused the blast." One report described the blast as "a double explosion and said it shook windows and rattled window panes."

The text of the document is as follows:

Case 275, Petersburg, Indiana, Nov. 30, 1956 - From a man of UFO reports sent to CIRPO by Frank Edwards. with Indianapolis, we quote from one as follows:
"Elvis Charles Martin, 606 N. Illinois St., an employee at one of the local produce houses, left his place of employment shortly after 5:30 p.m. to give the truck a test after he had worked on it. He turned the top of the hill and was driving to the first stop sign when he heard a noise at the rear of his truck, likened to 'three old time threshing machines all operating at the same time.' The object soon came into his view and he discovered that the noise was emitting from something that was slowly rising to the air from behind a woods about 1,000 yards distant.
"The object soon became visible and was spherical in shape, void of wings, had a diameter of about 15 feet and a height of 6 to 7 feet. It was further accompanied by a strange object some 150 feet away. The strange object ceased to make any sound and took off in a horizontal direction, traveling at great speed. Before it disappeared from sight, it made a sharp turn out of sight. Martin is a mechanic, and has been around airplanes and helicopters. He declares that what he saw was different from anything he ever saw. The object did not appear to have any windows, nor was it equipped with a tail. It arose vertically as though being pulled upward off the ground. He saw no land-ing gears or attached devices. He was surprised when it arose 150 feet that all noise ceased."
