FLYING SAUCER OBSERVED OVER SWEDEN

(Text)
"The unknown object observed this afternoon in the air in the neighborhood of Hassleholm, and which appeared and disappeared, Captain C. Johnson of the Trans Air Sweden Company told the Swedish telegraph service tonight. The first message which indicated the strange object described by the Defense Staff in a communique this evening. The object was also observed by his mechanism, Ole Johannson.
"It was something new I saw. Of that there is no doubt," he said, "who served in the BAF during the war of a career about 30 years from North Africa and Italy. "Suddenly, on my right, I saw something which I first thought was a narrow silhouette approaching with tremendous speed. I immediately warned my only passenger, Johansson, the mechanism. I had only four seconds in which to make my observations. Then the strange body came nearer I could see it was a metallic, silvery round or oblong celestial body. It proceeded below our aircraft without leaving any trace of gas or condensation. It was definitely not a meteor or other celestial body." It was about 60 to 70 meters below our aircraft at a height of 1,600 meters at the most.
"When I had seen the thing for about four seconds it disappeared under the none of our plane. But it had a better downward and rear-spoiled, could follow it for a further five seconds," Captain ------.
It was erroneously reported in our 1800 news bulletin that the object was observed for six to seven minutes. It should have been six to seven seconds.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
CIIIFS STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN 
TR-13 PAGE 2 OF 3

On Thursday, November 26, 1953, at about 19.37 hours, a newspaper scientist observed an "unknown object". The following is the translation of his report:

"The chief pilot of Transair, Capt. Uno Gustafsson, and his crew, Ghter. Staffanson and Stingstrom, all saw the same strange object at about 19.37 hours while travelling in the opposite direction from their aircraft which was on an estimated speed of 240 milOE per hour, at an attitude of 3,000 meters. Johann Stensson, who had good silhouette recognition, stated that what he saw was something abnormal perhaps birdlike. 

"The Transair plane was automatic control when the sighting occurred, Capt. Gustafsson did not take any note of the object, but the pilot and others noticed it and gave a verbal warning, saying: 'Look there - a new thing - quoi?' The object, according to the witnesses was about half the size of their plane." 

"Previously, I have been extremely skeptical about all the stories of flying saucers and so on, and our experiences now have tended to confirm my skepticism. However, now I don't know exactly what to think but I did see, with my own eyes, this strange object which flew past our plane at incredible speed."

"The object had a strong metal shining appearance. The Pilot, Johann Stensson, who could - see it very clearly, said it seemed to be shaped like a sphere or an ellipse and was excellent above the clouds, which were at an altitude of about 3,500 meters. The object was descending rapidly. The color was silver."

"The first silhouette I got was generally from the right. It was narrow, when slightly elliptical.

"Carefully looking, we could definitely not have waste gases or condensation trails."

"Stensson is strange, but usually quite cautious, disciplined Captain Gustafsson. Stensson has been just about everything in aviation and has very good silhouette recognition. From 1938 to 1948 he was a volunteer serving in ground crews."

IS THIS MYSTERIOUS OBJECT SEEN IN THE SKY OF SWEDEN
A SOVIET MISSILE OR A RADIO-GUIDED AIRCRAFT?

Stockholm, 18. A Swedish pilot and his mechanic who saw yesterday the mysterious missile in the sky of Sweden have considerably declared that the object was absolutely not a Swedish military plane.

They said: "I was sitting in the right seat of the DC-3 cockpit and could clearly observe the missile approaching to approximately 10 seconds. And so on what I could note, the object was not round or circular or elliptic shape. It had a light color between silvery and luminous."

To the question as of how he could determine the speed of the missile, which they had about 30 minutes - once again, according to the pilots, there were no persons aboard and no sound was heard. According to their estimation, the speed of the object had reach was several times the speed of light.

The Swedish General Staff is a carefully studying all the declarations and reports which have reached yesterday. They maintain that the spotted object is a missile (russian) provided with teleavision cameras and that it carried out a functional test while approaching the Swedish territory from the western side. 

He has been ascertained, for sure that it was not a military Swedish aircraft, not even a balloon loaded with leaflets, but available information makes this hypothesis also scarce.

A spokesman of the General Staff has reminded that Capt. ... and his mechanic are absolutely reliable and that the U.F.O. seen by them in the Swedish Air Force area are absolutely reliable.

The O.F.C.I.C.I. also said that the traces recorded by radar ground stations cannot be considered as mysterious or contradictory reports about unidentified objects overflying under uncertain trajectories. Many of such signals are not identified and precision necessary for such reports is lost in the normal routine of operational duty.

The text on the document discusses "night newspapers" and "unidentified objects" that were reportedly seen in the sky near Hassleholm, Sweden. The document states that these "unidentified objects" were likely misidentified, but their presence was confirmed by multiple witnesses. According to the report, the objects would be a "guided missile" or something similar.

For ATIC purposes, the clipping itself or a brief summary of UFO articles which appear to be significant will suffice.
