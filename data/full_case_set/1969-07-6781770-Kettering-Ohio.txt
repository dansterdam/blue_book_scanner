OCR Output:

THE PHENOMEN' >N RAPIDLY SHIFTED FROM POINT TO POINT, INDICATING THAT IT APPEARED TO BE OF A SOLID OR SEMI-SOLID NATURE . IT WAS SAID TO BE "TRANSPARENT" WHETHER THIS MEANS IT WAS SEE- THROUGH OR MERELY BRIGHT AND TRANSLUCENT IS NOT CLEAR. IT HAD A SORT OF RAGGED OUTLINE, INDICATING IT WAS NOT A SMOOTH, REGULAR OBJECT LIKE STARS, A LIGHT OR SATELLITE.

THE PHENOMENON HAD A LIGHT THAT SEEMED BRIGHT TO THE OBSERVER AND IN FACT THE OBSERVER STATED IT WAS ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST OBJECTS HE HAD EVER SEEN. IN SPITE OF THE BRIGHTNESS, IT DID NOT SEEM TO DAZZLE OR HURT THE OBSERVER'S EYES AS ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT LIGHT SOURCE CLOSE TO THE EARTH. IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 1/2 MILE AWAY AND ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL AIRPLANE.

IT MOVED ABOUT RAPIDLY, CHANGING DIRECTIONS AND ALTITUDE SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE SIGHTING, WHICH LASTED ABOUT 15 MINUTES. AT ONE POINT IT APPEARED TO EXTEND A FEELER OR TENTACLE -LIKE PROJECTION FROM ONE SIDE, WHICH SLOWLY RETRACTED. IT GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF HAVING PROBES OR ANTENNAE. THE PHENOMENON FINALLY SEEMED TO FADE OUT, GRADUALLY LOSING LUMINOSITY UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED ON THE HORIZON.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE BEHIND OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME?
No.

The image contains two sketches depicting the apparent movement of a UFO. The sketches show a lighted object with a trail, suggesting its trajectory. Based on the text, the object is described as being about 50 feet in diameter.

APR 20-17(C)I)
WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE? HOLD A MATCH AT ARM'S LENGTH IN FRONT OF A KNOWN OBJECT, SUCH AS A STREET LAMP 20 FEET AWAY. NOTE HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT IS COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD. THIS GIVES A GOOD ESTIMATE OF THE ANGULAR SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE OBJECT APPEARS TO BE COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD, THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT THE PHENOMENON WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE MATCH HEAD.

The image provided appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. It contains a compass rose diagram and two sketches depicting sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena.

The compass rose diagram provides instructions on how to use a compass to indicate the direction of a sighting. The two sketches show different perspectives of a sighting, likely from an observer's point of view.

Extracting the text from the document:

AS NOW INDICATED, YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. PLACE AN "X" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN. PLACE A "B" ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION TO THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN.

IN THE SKETCH BELOW, PLACE AN "A" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN FIRST SEEN, AND A "B" AT THE POSITION OF THE PHENOMENON WHEN LAST SEEN. CONNECT THE TWO POINTS WITH A STRAIGHT LINE.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch of two objects in the sky, a larger disc-shaped object and a smaller object. The text below the image provides some description of the objects, indicating that the drawing will show the shape and size of the phenomenon observed, and provide an arrow to indicate the direction the phenomenon was moving.

TEXT OUTPUT:
THIS DRAWING WILL SHOW THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE PHENOMENON. IT INCLUDES AN ARROW THAT MIGHT INDICATE BY AN ARROW THE DIRECTION THE PHENOMENON WAS MOVING.

WHAT WAS THE ANGULAR SIZE IN MILS OF THE OBJECT OBSERVED? ON THE STREET THIS OBJECT WOULD BE ABOUT AS LARGE AS (WHAT OBJECT) AND (HOW FAR) AWAY, JUDGING BY THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. HOW MUCH OF THE OBJECT WAS COVERED BY THIS MEASURED ANGLE, AND APPROXIMATELY WHAT ANGLE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBTENDED BY THE TOTAL OBJECT?
