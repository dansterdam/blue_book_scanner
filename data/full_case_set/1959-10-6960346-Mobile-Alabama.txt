Sir:

I wish to thank you for the copy of blue book report which I requested. however, I noticed on page 5 last paragraph, that it indicated that this sighting was mentioned in reports from October 8, 1957 - November 7, 1959, and attempted to determine if any other reports were included in files. I find 33 days of massive sightings that this element was almost air years ago but my friend and I had not it the original report as we expected. Our reason or interest in retracing it.

The transcription of the text in the document is as follows:

"This was reported to the city of Mobile, Alabama police station at approximately 1959 on the evening of 6 October 1959. The individuals who reported this incident stated that they were traveling on the U.S. Highway 90 approximately 13 miles west of Mobile, Alabama when they observed a luminous round object hovering above the highway. This object was described as being approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter and it appeared to be rotating slowly. The object was estimated to be about 300 to 500 feet above the highway. The witnesses further stated that the object appeared to be extremely brilliant and was lighting up the surrounding area almost as bright as day. After observing the object for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, it suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The witnesses were quite shaken and upset by this incident and requested that an investigation be conducted. This case is presently under investigation by the appropriate authorities."

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text describing a sighting of a satellite passing over the crater Copernicus on the moon. The key details provided in the text are:

- The satellite passed over the crater Copernicus on the way around. It was impossible to determine whether the object or its shadow was being observed.
- The average time of orbit was 6 minutes, and the object was seen every night.
- On November 9, the satellite either greatly increased its speed or was pursued by another object of similar likeness as a "double image" was seen. The object has not been seen since.
- A letter of inquiry to the Smithsonian Institute revealed they had not seen the object, but said such an object was reported.

would have to be traveling at 70,000 miles per hour and remote controlled. As I gave them only the time of orbit(I could compute nothing else), I am not even that under stand this figure.
I confirmed the readings; the object was also seen by my parents.
To date there is no indication of its origin or nature.
