SIGNED STATEMENT

I, Warren J. Sigmundson, 2nd Lt., USAF, AO 12613792, 34th Air Division 
(Def.), Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On Friday evening 17 October 1952, at approximately 2115 MST, I 
observed a strange object in the sky. While sitting in the Municipal 
Stadium, watching a local football game, I happened to look to the north 
and saw what appeared to be a very large meteor, the path of fall was 
almost vertical and toward magnetic north. The object gave off a bright 
bluish-green color, and emitted a sudden flash when it disappeared from 
view.

It is extremely difficult to describe the size of the object because, 
as the moon, it was only in sight for two (2) seconds. It was, however, 
larger than the average falling star, the object appeared to twist itself 
out rather than fall from sight. This was borne out by the approach 
flash at the end of the fall. Estimates on speed was other factors of 
which it would be impossible to give an accurate estimate due to the 
leet of comparable size.

SIORN STATEMENT

I, Charles R Coble, Maj. USAF, AO 9004755, 490th Air Base Group, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

At approximately 2110 hours, on the night of 17 October 1952, while traveling into Taos, New Mexico, I observed from the car window, high in the sky, a large blue object about the size of a volley ball. This object was traveling from a north to a northeast direction at about 45 to 70 degrees angle, and was bright blue in color. It would estimate its speed as approximately 2,500 miles per hour, and was approximately 10,000 feet above the ground.

I would say that I observed the object for about 2 or 3 seconds, and it then disappeared.

(Tec), Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

On Friday evening 17 October 1952, at approximately 2110 hours MST, 
I observed a strange object in the sky. While watching a football game 
at Municipal Stadium, I noticed what appeared to be a very large meteor 
east of Albuquerque traveling north. The object was a bright blue-green,
and falling very rapidly. It was only in view for about one (1) second,
and it was not possible to estimate any speed. The object appeared to 
burn itself out rather than fall from the sky.

SWORN STATEMENT

I, William J. Arrowood, 2d Lieutenant, USAF, AO 1650521, 490th Air Base Group, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

At about 2115 hours, 17 October 1952, I saw an object about the size of a football streak through the sky in a southwest to northeast direction. I was sitting in the public schools stadium in the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico at the time. I estimate the object to be traveling at a speed of over 2000 miles per hour and at an altitude of 30,000 feet. It seemed to me that this object was a meteorite and it was bright blue in color.

I would say that I observed the object for about 3 seconds, and it then disappeared.
