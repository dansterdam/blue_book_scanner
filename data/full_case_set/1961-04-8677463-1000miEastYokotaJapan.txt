AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
STATION: Yokota AB, Japan 
DATE OF INFORMATION: 27 Apr 61
REPORTING OFFICER: Major V. L. Sadowski
SUBJECT: Unidentified Object 

On 27 Apr 61 at approximately 1700 hrs, while on a routine flight from Okinawa to Yokota AB, Japan, the crew of a Far East American Airlines aircraft, a-1, observed an unidentified object. The object was first sighted at approximately 1000 miles east of Yokota AB at an altitude of approximately 35,000 feet. 

The object was described as being round in shape, silver in color and approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed for approximately 20-25 minutes. The object appeared to be stationary and was described as having a steady, brilliant white light.

When the aircraft approached to within approximately 15 miles of the object, it appeared to accelerate and climb rapidly, disappearing from view in approximately 10 seconds.

The reporting pilot, Capt American Airlines, stated that the object was not any type of known aircraft and that he could not offer any explanation as to what the object was. The weather at the time was clear and visibility was excellent.

The sighting was reported to Yokota AB control tower upon arrival and the necessary information was forwarded to higher headquarters.
