Text from the document:

South Boston, Va. 24592
Dear Lt. Richard Bin:  I am forwarding additional notes and sketches relative to the January 10, 1965 UFO sighting.

                 Richard Wharff 

                     South Boston, Va.

On the night of January 10, 1965, my daughter, two sons, and I observed a very unusual object in the sky. It was a large, glowing object which hovered at an estimated height of about 300 feet. The object was round and apparently had a metallic-like hull or surface. It was brilliantly lit from within. There were blinking lights around the outer edge which changed color from red, to green, to orange. The object made no sound whatsoever. It hovered for approximately 8 minutes and then began to ascend vertically at a rapid rate of speed until it disappeared from sight. My family and I were astounded by this experience and felt extremely fortunate to have been witness to such a rare and unusual phenomena. I hope these additional notes and sketches will be of value to your investigation. Please let me know if you need any further information.

Sincerely,
Richard Wharff

The object was described as cigar-shaped, about 50-60 feet long, and about 20 feet wide. It was a dull metallic color and appeared to give off a reddish glow. The object hovered for a few minutes, then moved away at a high rate of speed.
Mr. and Mrs. Johnson were the only witnesses to this incident. The case was investigated by the Air Force and was classified as "Unidentified".
