There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document is titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" and contains text entries with details about a "newspaper clipping" related to an unidentified flying object sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFO)

ORGANIZATION: 2169 HOURS (CENTRAL STD) 11 MAY 1961, WICHITA FALLS, TEXAS AND SHEPPARD AFB, TEXAS
A newspaper clipping from the WICHITA FALLS RECORD NEWS, dated 12 May 1961, concerning a report of an unidentified flying object seen over Wichita Falls, Texas, and Sheppard AFB, Texas, on 11 May 1961. 
The clipping states that several persons reported seeing a bright light in the sky at about 2100 hours on 11 May 1961. The light was observed for about 30 minutes. It was described as much larger than a star, changing colors, and moving about erratically.
AP Form 112 instead of ATIC Form 104, because this organization does not have ATIC Form 104.
