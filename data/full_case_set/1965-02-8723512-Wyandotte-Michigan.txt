The image contains a page from an old UFO report document, which appears to be part of Project Blue Book. The page contains a sketch showing a compass-like diagram with angles and instructions for describing the location of a UFO sighting. There is also a prompt for the viewer to draw a picture showing the motion and direction of the UFO object or objects.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the dashed line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it. Place a "C" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

Dear Sir
Our report here in Wyandotte, Michigan is about a strange incident which occurred near our home. At approximately 10:45 PM on February 5, 1965, my wife and I were in our home when we noticed a bright light in the sky. We went outside and observed a large, bright object, which appeared to be hovering approximately 100 to 150 feet above the ground. The object was roughly oval-shaped and seemed to be emitting a pulsating glow. It remained in the same general area for several minutes before slowly moving away and disappearing from our view. We have no idea what this object was, but it was certainly unlike anything we had ever seen before. Please let me know if you need any additional information.
Sincerely,
[redacted]

Dear Mr. ****,

Unidentified flying objects, as you know, are not classified on Project Blue Book. This is the current report on Blue Book which will answer the questions posed in your letter.

There are no photographs or other evidence submitted for this case. The radar reports submitted were determined to be a misinterpretation of natural or conventional objects.

Dear sirs,
I would like to inform you that I would like some more information about flying saucers. I would greatly appreciate it if you could give me any information you have on this subject. Also I would like to know if you can give me some idea as to what some of the information is about, and if we can't have copies of reports, can you give me some pointers so I can at least get a general idea of what is in your files. I know some of the information is classified, and you can't divulge it, but it would be very helpful to me if you can give me just a little more information so I can have some idea. You can give me whatever information you can, as I will greatly appreciate it.
Your friend,
