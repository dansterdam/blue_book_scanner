Text output:

COMMENTS ON THE DEPARTING OFFICER: As apparently about 0235 hours (JST) on 19 February 1958 an unknown radar target was detected at a US radar site in JAPAN. The phenomena was connected with the high speed apparent departure of two objects from the premises that an explosion was detected. It was known that there was an increase in the radar operation at that time. Additional details of the operation were also obtained from the Maritime and Air Staff Officers of the Department of the Air Force. Changes would be detected at Weather Stations in JAPAN. The phenomena occurred in VICINITY of MATSUE 35-28N 133-03E. An analysis of the operation was taken from this search. (Refer to CCCW 145, in 1958-58)
