Date you completed this questionnaire: 10-27-65
Day: 27
Month: 10
Year: 65

Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

I have mentioned in my earlier statement the number of points that I can recall, and I do not wish to repeat them. However, there are a few points and comments that I would like to make. The object that I saw was large in size, approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter, and was hovering about 50 feet above the ground. It was emitting a bright light that was illuminating the ground and trees below. The light was not concentrated in a beam, but rather a diffuse light that spread out over a large area. I am quite certain that this was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. I watched the object for several minutes as it hovered silently, then suddenly it accelerated and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. I realize that my report may seem unbelievable to some, but I can assure you that I am telling the truth to the best of my recollection. I hope that this additional information is helpful in your investigation.

"At approximately 12:45 a.m. CT on 8 October 1965, I was awakened by a noise outside. I looked out the window and saw a bright light which appeared to be hovering low over the neighbor's house adjacent to mine. The light slowly moved away to the southwest. It seemed to be about 30 feet long, 15 feet high, and about 10 feet wide. It was a white light, not blinking, and did not make any noise that I could hear. The light appeared to be solid and emitting its own light. It moved at a slow pace and was visible for about 3 minutes before disappearing from sight. Subsequent to this incident, I have had some weird experiences, but nothing as dramatic as this one."

The image appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document dated October 15, 1963, and is titled "FLYING SAUCER REVIEW". The page contains a report on an "Alarm in Ecuador", describing sightings of hundreds of saucers flying overhead and a large population watching a "luminous object" climbing up the volcano Recu Pichincha near Quito. The report mentions photographs, reporters, and many witnesses being present for the event.

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

Alarm in Ecuador

The governments of some of the smaller states are no longer ruling their fears that as invasion is imminent. Only the other day we had the scene of "Alarm, panic and commotion". (Noticias, Argentinas, Oct. 18). The towns of Quito and its environs, Ecuador, were the scene of the happening. Hundreds of saucers flying overhead, and an announcement on channel 6 of the local radio, that the population was at that moment watching a luminous object, certainly not a satellite, as it appeared to climb the volcano Recu Pichincha, east of Quito. Photographers, reporters, and many sighs netters were on the scene.

Bexhill posse
Reader S. P. Farmer (of Row Hill, East Sussex) tells of a sighting by himself and two friends on October 17, 1965.
He and his two friends, who live near Hastings, and was looking out across houses and fields towards the town when, he says, "I first took to be a bright star setting beyond a line of trees. About half a minute later I realized that it was not a star but an object suspended about 500-600 ft in the air. 
The possibility that the object was a planet was eliminated when it remained stationary in approximately the same position, and moving erratically upwards and downwards, for about 15-20 minutes.
Someone then suggested that it could be a light moving up and down, but our reader borrowed some binoculars and observed that the object was distinct and not of aircraft or any other known form of aerial transit, being about 50-60 feet in diameter.
At 6:30 p.m. it simply went out like a light. At that time I went into the house to a fire, and when I came out a few minutes later it had gone.
Not one of us who observed the phenomenon are given to flights of fancy, but we all felt that we had seen something which we just could not explain.

Hovering object in Transkei

From the Rand Daily Mail of October 22nd:
"A strange object was seen hanging in the air over Transkei this week.
The object was seen on Thursday by Mr. M. J. Comins, of Mbulane in the Middeldift district. He said he watched it for about five minutes as it hung motionless in the sky."

21 Oct 65
Transkei, Africa

A strange bright red and round object was
sighted over Transkei by many people. It
was seen over the Tuskies village area and
seen by the oncoming Boeing airliners. 
The object hovered for almost 15 minutes, 
then suddenly shot off at an incredible
speed and then vanished out of sight. There 
was no sound and no trail. We were all
amazed and excited. I was able to take a
look at it but it disappeared very quickly.
There was no noise, and the sighting lasted 
for about 15 minutes before it took off.

MORE CLOSE SIGHTINGS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE: On October 22nd, at least two very good sightings were made in New Hampshire. The first by a man named Oscar - "Tall man, in his forties, with gray hair..."He wrote to the newspapers to call the second an "enormous flying object over the farmstead" Shovted - "When he saw it, the bright flying object was over the farmstead. Shaped like a football, it gave off a greenish glow through its transparent sides and seemed to be about 50 feet long. He said it was disc-shaped, and glowed red, while the rounded sides were a bright glow." 
Five minutes later, the object left, travelling at a terrific rate of speed. The other man, "a little olderman", was driving on Rockrimack St., when he saw a similar bright light moving very rapidly through the sky. He almost had a collision with his car when the mysterious object finally stopped almost directly over him. Suddenly it took off at an unbelievable rate of speed and vanished. The object is said to have three bright green lights set in a triangular pattern about 20 to 30 feet across. It also had a red light. All the lights could be clearly seen against the dark sky. From time to time the object would suddenly move away rapidly, in a southerly direction. There was no sound except a "hissing" noise like that of a steam coming out of a radiator valve. (Manchester, N.H. Union Leader, 10/23/65.)"

Penge mystery
Reader V. K. Stanoevic of 29 Montpelier Grove, London, S.E.20, sent us the following account: "Last night, October 27, 1965, as I was driving home, I noticed a strange object hovering silently about 200 yards away from us, standing in the car park of the Crooked Billet Garage when my friend and I first saw it. As we approached it, moving away from us to our left and up and away from us, I continued driving this way, I suddenly realised the car headlamps were swinging wildly away from the object as I was pointing them straight at it. About 10-15 seconds it started to get brighter and brighter and then it suddenly became a brilliant white. Once again it moved, this time I have no idea how high it went, but in around 5 seconds it was a mere speck and had gone completely. It did not appear again. The whole incident took about one minute, I have no idea how high it was, but on ground of where I was standing, I could see it quite clearly. P.S. I hope this will confirm some-

FLYING SAUCER INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE
Regular Meeting ---First Friday of each Month --- 8:30 P.M.
November 3, 1955 --- Central Y.M.C.A. on Center & Dodge Streets - Akron,O.

SIGHTINGS
Several sightings have been reported to the Committee during the month of October. Information is continuing to come in relation to the summer sightings, and the reports have continued into this fall season.

N.I.C.A.P.? investigators in the Pittsburgh,Pa. area have completed an investigation of U.F.O. sightings in that Corry,Pa.section, covering the past year. A few details on their findings will be discussed at the meeting. George could give us a picture of some of the findings.
It was also reported that several sightings of a red-orange colored object have been made by responsible observers in the Pittsburgh area. The object seems to slow down and move towards the trees over which it is observed. The trail was not visible by these observers. The sightings denies had been confirmed by independent photographers. The picture taken from an estimated one-fourth-mile distance.

Locally, a daylight sighting was made by two employees of Columbia Chemical of Barberton, Ohio (St. Rt.619), on October 8,1955. The time was 10:45 A.M. on Friday,the same day as the Corry,Pa. sighting. The day was clear and snid had observed traffic passing in the area at the time. The object hovered low over the field for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing in a westerly direction very rapidly.

A few moments later, as they crossed a part of the field, they pointed to a place considerably lower than the jet-trail and asked 'Remote what it was he seemed to notice some indication that it was the same object which had just passed. The sighting was described as oval-shaped and about 25 to 30 feet in diameter. It hovered over the field, then accelerated at an extremely high rate of speed to the north and approached until it took a secondary position at an elevation of 2 degrees and remained in that position for 12 seconds. It then charged again and became a long range object reporting from its observation to the northwest.

On August 11, 1953 at 6:50 P.M. Gary Tall reported seeing a clearly outlined round object he could not identify. It was a dull silver color. It came from the direction of the man-made moon only 3.5 degrees in elevation. It traveled at high speed for approximately 5 minutes then made a sharp turn of right angles to its original course. Its path was generally S.W. to N.E.

On July 10, 1955, at 2:00 P.M. Joseph Brakat was driving U.S. Route 21, near Chagrin Falls, Ohio when he saw what looked like a large silver football high in the sky. He stopped his car, got out, but there was nothing there to see. The incident was described as a bright mirror-like reflection seen for several seconds.

Cleveland,O.--Oct.9,1955--(1) 8:10 P.M.--Gold disk with rotating lights on edge, with a pulsating halo was reported to NICAP by Joseph Neumann under investigation.
