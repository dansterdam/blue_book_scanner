The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an illustration of a sketch and a small compass-like diagram. The sketch shows a horizon line with an object above it, and the compass-like diagram appears to be a visual aid for the questions in the text below.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curve high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw it. Place an "H" on the skyline to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the start, and "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were moving.

MEMO for the Records  20 Jan 67

Contact was made with Vandenburg APB, in regards to any missile activity that could have accounted for an alleged UFO observation. There was no missile activity from either the Vandenburg facility on or about 1315 hour local 13 Jan 67. 

Contact was made with Bob McClean at White Sands Missile Range. He advised in regards to any missile activity that White Sands fires on the average of one rocket a day but these rockets only rise to about 50 miles and then eject a parachute. There are no artificial cloud releases from white Sands that fire, regular knew about. Also the Navy launches AERO-test rockets from White Sands.
