8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
    It was 9:15 p.m. CST and this object was noticed. It seemed to be a bright light and observed it to break into numerous parts. These lights faded in and out as if to disappear. Suddenly from as 3,000' elevation 25' in a straight line this object shoots across the sky and just faded out of sight in distance. Duration 3-4 min.
9. COURSE  Generally E
10. COMMENTS
    It is concluded that sighting resulted in a probable satellite re-entering Panda Bear refueling sector. Pattern of lights described by witnesses was probably those of tanker. Direction of travel seen in this instance is highly indicative of that INFORMATION AVAILABLE which indicates objects seen are unscheduled space vehicles or that they constitute threat to security of U.S.

I will now act as an OCR (optical character recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

I had both men trace out the apparent path and the path crossed the meridian at an elevation of about 30Â°. The path did not come any where near the zenith, as was originally indicated.
The lights apparently began their motion at the instant that the numerous lights appeared. The lights preserved their particular pattern and moved across the sky as a small, compact cluster that could easily have been covered by the thumbnail held at arm's length. Apparently the two lights may have seen like a single luminous sphere around the field, but he was not sure. Both men insisted that the six bright light was there and stationary at least three or four minutes before it was seen to break up into smaller lights.
The breakup apparently was not explosive as indicated earlier but they appeared in a sudden fashion. I asked the men to think calmly about how long it took the cluster of lights to fade to the disappearance point. The lights just faded out in the distance and then it was difficult to tell it down independent on seeing that I had provided them with.
When I opened the papers the results of the ballot was 3 minutes and 4 minutes. Both men, incidentally, confirmed the fact the cluster of lights was trailed by an "itty bitty a light" that differed from the others in color, apparently being more reddish, and which emitted sparks. Questioned about the sparks, he said that there was just an occasional spark from the light, perhaps about 2 an all during the interval.
The conclusion proceeded successively on the noise and no incident of coming back to the subject or attempting to knock them would shake them from the fact that the noise real and very easily audible after the tractors had been shut off. who had served with SACD as an engine mechanic, knows his planes and prided himself during his Air Force term of duty that he could recognize various types of planes at considerable distances by the sound of their motors. He did not concentrate on the lights but on the sound and was attempting to turn over in his mind during the entire sighting just what type of engine it might be. He could identify no single engine. The noise resembled that of a diesel, of a pulsating jet, and of the rumble of thunder; he said sound effects run might have produced it by shaking a large piece of tin.
The time of this sighting apparently is determined to plus or minus 5 minutes of 11:45 PM on November 20th (incidentally the date of the original report, November 15, is in error), the accuracy being ascribable to the fact that the boys had determined that they would not be home until their parents became uneasy and so noted the time.

work past midnight and had been watching their watches rather closely and were getting ready to call it a night. After the apparition the boys sat around in the field finishing their cigarettes and discussing what they would have done had the thing landed in the field and had they been invited to take a ride!
The next day, in the course of their official duties, they discussed it with their fellow airmen, getting a considerable amount of razzing, the story finally coming to the ears of Capt. Pilon. He had the men report this then through official channels. He personally was at first tempted to dismiss the whole thing but then felt that it was wiser to have the thing on record and officially recorded lest something should come of it later. (Good boy). On that very day, November 21, the same chap, a farmer, said that he had been lying in bed the previous night about that time and heard what he thought to be a diesel train coming up the track. It seemed to pass about 1/3 of a mile from his home. Both he and his wife apparently heard the noise, which puzzled them, because the train never seemed to arrive at the house and to pass by as is the wont of trains that travel on tracks that pass by people's houses. He did not get out of bed to investigate (serious lack of scientific curiosity). Also on November 21, another farmer who had been helping move one grain which procedure it is believed to have been moving, had taken his very fancy tractor to a farm during the course of the procedure. When the tractor started hovering over the tractor in an attempt to find out the trouble, the incident of the previous evening was apparently recalled just briefly,whereupon Dietrich exclaimed something about that he had seen the same thing, before the other two boys were able to go into any details. They did not discuss the matter further because they quickly turned to discussing the mechanical misbehavior of the tractor and to disassemble a portion thereof. Incidentally, asked is located six to eight miles from the field in question. Another piece of incidental intelligence, Capt. ____ is long-time employee of the Caterpillar Tractor Company and he knows personally the writer of the Alexander Botts stories of Earthworm Tractor fame in the Saturday Evening Post. Upon, I believe the name is, found writing the Alexander Botts stories so profitable that he quit his job at Caterpillar Tractor Company, and became a professional writer. When we had finished with the inspection of the field, we all called upon Mr. ______ who was the son-in-law of the owner of the farm. He was quite disturbed by the incident and felt that there had been some governmental intrusion upon his property, but his wife was more concerned about the boys who would be sure to have nightmares as a result of their experience. He said he intended to keep in touch with us and let us know if anything further developed.

There does not appear to be a photograph present in this page from the old UFO report document. The text describes the witness's account of seeing a low-flying plane with a row of square lights, which then proceeded to move silently and disappear from view. The text does not mention or describe any specific photograph.

WHO lives approximately 3 or 4 miles from the field. On that night of November 20, at some undetermined time, but definitely prior to 11 o'clock, and most probably between 10 and 10:30, ********* has been coming back from town and as he walked into his farmhouse, he looked up and saw what he took to be a low-flying plane with a row square lights like compartment windows. He associated no noise with the sighting. He walked unhurriedly into the house and called to his wife to ask whether she-'would care to see a flying saucer. They both looked out the kitchen window (and I did too later) and saw this object proceeding at a vague clip, actually no observer but he has a disarming honesty about his vagueness. He just didn't know anything other than he had seen some lights, a low-flying craft aircraft, and no noise and he wasn't even sure of directions until I had to identify them for him. As close as we can get, the craft was moving from south to north, and disappeared from his view in his northwest quadrant. His comment is a paragon of negative curiosity and a good 20 minutes' questioning yielded only a few crumbs, but well-repeated crumbs, of basic information.

Bidding good-bye to ********* shortly thereafter to *********** and I proceeded back to the headquarters of the *********** and I thereupon the Captain and Sam to have lunch with me at the nursery. After luncheon I did both those courtesies good-bye and reported in to the ticket desk only to find that my flight had been cancelled and that the next one left some four hours later. I retired to the nursery to sleep. I have now awakened from my nap and this is being dictated in the nursery of the greater Peoria airport. It is yet one and a half hours to flight time.

Suggested solutions: During the entire course of interrogation, two things kept coming to mind: One is that the white lights originally described so closely with landing light ends; Second, that the close cluster of lights likewise tallied with the sighting of my own about 1950 from the balcony of the Perkins Observatory. There I had turned a 8-inch telescope on to the apparition and studied the arrangement of lights quite closely. There were some 3 lights arranged in a cluster formation that somehow reminded me of a small Christmas tree making a stately cruise of the sky. This later turned out to be, after a good deal of puzzling and a gross many no's and denials that anybody knew anything, to be a KC-97 tanker. A tanker of this sort has, I understand, a large boom light and numerous running lights scattered over its vast expanse.

The text in the document is as follows:

"during refueling operations every light on the plane is on full blast. At the close of our first morning session, before we repaired to the field, I had pointed out this resemblance to Capt. *** and asked whether there were any tanker runs in the area. Capt. *** said that KC-97's one on the way out, but that there were two of them based at O'Hare and that conceivably they might have come down this way. I had pointed out this resemblance to his lights and that both this, and the fact that they had seen it stationary for so long, did not jibe with the tanker interpretation.

Nevertheless, when we returned to the squadron base after our interview with *** and found that *** had been doing some investigating of his own and had found that there was a tanker run called Panla Bear that operated between Indianapolis, Kansas City, Desmoines and Springfield and that the erratic motion on the map may very scene he had been had over Mackinack. It now remains to determine whether on the night of November 30th there was indeed a tanker run in progress.

The case as one might reconstruct it on a tanker hypothesis follows: the tanker was making circular runs of very large radius, as I used to observe in the Columbus area, near Lockborne Air Force Base. This tanker may have seen the boom light, which is reported to be/large,and bright, white lights on one of this wings around the field. On his next swing around, he may have spotted the tanker on a straight line run nearly parallel to his line of sight. From the tanker *** stated that he had seen the small light trailing. This would presumably be the jet on the stern chase, closing in for contact with the boom. The breaking up into several lights could very well arise from the fact that although originally resolved they were lost in the glare of the white light until the plane came close enough so that the angular separation of the lights was sufficient to allow the lights to be visible despite the white lights. This would give the appearance of suddenly having come into view. The noise could be explained by being the composite noise of the reciprocating engines of the KC-97 and the noise of the jet motors. Combined, these two sounds would make identification with any one type of aircraft a bit difficult! There is nothing in the remainder of the flight that would run counter to this interpretation other than the salient fact that no navigation lights were noted by. However, assuming that *** had seen the same plane an hour or so earlier (it was quite close), the rather erratic motions can be explained as the tanker making the circular runs to get in the proper position for the fuel transfer."

usual for the Lockbocne tanker to circle about for at least an hour) then this can be cleared up also, because , and his wife both felt certain, after a rather insistent recall, that there had been colored lights on the plane, on the draft, and they they must have been red and green, because if they had been anything else they would have noticed it. If we use this highly unspecific intelligence information for all its worth, we can make out a case for the plane having had navigation lights and that either and were so intent on the unusual formation or the rest of the lights that they failed to notice lights that were normal and which they would not have considered at all unusual, or that the tanker had momentarily flipped out its navigation lights in favor of the other bright lights. Even our experience, I can admit that the tanker lights I saw were so bright that I am not certain whether I also saw navigation lights. It is my best belief that I did not. Indeed, if I had, I would not have remained puzzled as long as I did by the apparition. Likewise, the jet should have had navigation lights and these were not reported.
The suggested solution is therefore by no means all-right, but, as a solution, depends crucially upon there being a tanker formation in the area so that time on thinks might, if so, then we must assume that either the navigational lights were cut or went unnoticed.
If this prove? to have been a tanker, it will serve as an excellent example of how an unusual but quite natural phenomenon can remain a UFO for a long while, sometimes permanently, unless investigated as soon as possible.

That is all!!!!!

A REPORT OF THE VISIT TO PEORIA ILLINOIS ON SUNDAY DECEMBER 10, 1961
TO Check Into the UFO Sighting of November 20, 1961.
In question
The sighting/was reported through to the Aerial Phenomenon Division by Capt. Ronald L. Pilon, Intelligence Officer of the 169th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 2325 Airport Road, Peoria, Illinois. To check into the facts of this case in accordance with our policy to have such facts by direct interview as soon as possible after the sighting.
I visited Peoria, Illinois on Sunday, December 10, 1961, arriving Peoria at 8:30 AM. I was met by Capt. Pilon, who had arranged a meeting at 10:00 AM in his office all the principals. Prior to the meeting, we discussed the points of this case as they had been reported to him. These were essentially the same as those reported by him through official channels.
A summary of the details obtained by direct questioning of (1) Mr. ---------------- (engine Mechanic attached to the Fighter Squadron), (2) Mr. ---------------- (also attached to the Squadron) and (3) Mr. ------------------ (farmer in the area who, with his wife, claimed he had seen 'the same thing independently'). Mr. ------------------ was unable to come to the general meeting so we sought him out after the meeting and after visiting the site (some 20 miles from the place of our meeting).
The principal witnesses were -------------- a recently married,young man whose father owns a 900 acre farm in Haddnack, Illinois. -------------- The father is retired and young ----------------- is running it is said to be much the prosperous young farmer. 
The farm buildings were in fine condition and sported one of the fanciest silos I have ever seen. In the midst of this prosperity, the 169th Tactical Fighter Squadron, an Illinois Air National Guard outfit apparently, was activated in the recent crisis, necessitating leaving a lot of farm work undone. In an attempt to meet his own crisis, Appenzeller is trying to do quite a bit of the farm work at night. The -------------- apparently have a very nice summer home in Northern Wisconsin and had visited them on occasion up until this obligation, because of this obligation, although he has no connection with it. He is a printer by trade, age 25. On the night of November 20th, we find these gentlemen plowing this field from 6:00 PM with the intention of

They are not absolutely certain they lit a cigarette at this time but they found themselves with . cigarettes after the sighting was over, so presumably lighted them just about that time. had just looked again at the white light, turned back tossed back and in a short instant looked back toward the light. In that short interval the light had broken up into numerous (8 to a dozen, they couldn't agree) other white lights, clustering about the main white light. These lights faded in and out with no apparent periodicity or pattern. They did not go completely out but while one dimmed and brightened three or four times another one might have dimmed only once. The lights were clustered close together and indicated that in the spaces between the lights there would have been only enough room to fit at most one other light. This cluster of lights then moved from an elevation of about 35* and azimuth 230, in essentially a straight line to an elevation of about 20* almost directly in the east.
