PROJECT BLUE BOOK SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS  
INCIDENTS REPORTED FROM OCEAN SPRINGS, MISSISSIPPI 
8 JULY 1962

OBSERVATIONS OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA

The purpose of this report is to provide a summary of observations of unidentified aerial phenomena reported in the Ocean Springs, Mississippi area on 8 July 1962. These reports were investigated by personnel from Project Blue Book. 

Multiple observers reported seeing bright, oval-shaped objects maneuvering in the sky on the evening of 8 July 1962. The objects were described as bright, luminous, and capable of sudden changes in direction and speed. Ground-based radar was unable to detect the objects. Photographic evidence was obtained, but the images were inconclusive and did not clearly show the objects in question.

This report provides details on the eyewitness accounts, radar observations, and photographic evidence collected during the investigation. No definitive conclusions were reached regarding the nature or origin of the observed phenomena.

Description of Accident:

On July 8, 1962, at approximately 7:30 P.M., CDT, a sighting of an unidentified flying object was reported by several witnesses in the Ocean Springs, Mississippi, area. The object was described as circular in shape, with a diameter estimated to be 30 to 50 feet, and was observed to be hovering approximately 300 feet above the ground.

CASE NO. PR 62 - 6186 DATE: 8 July 1962 LOCATION: OCEAN SPRINGS, MISSISSIPPI

SUMMARY: At 1925 hours on 7 July 1962, the witness, a resident of Ocean Springs, Mississippi, observed a bright, disc-shaped object hovering over the water near the Gulf of Mexico shore. The object was reported to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter and emitting a bright, steady light from its underside. The object was observed for approximately 10 minutes before accelerating and disappearing at a high rate of speed.

- page 30 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Azimuth (3) Object disappeared about 8" above the horizon at 65° 
(4) Object was 900' to 1000' feet from house. The object 
was moving very slowly from right to left at 65° at approx 
imately 30 mph. The object was quite large and cast a red 
glow. As it continued to move from right to left, it began
decreasing and increasing in intensity. 
She said her husband standing near her became alarmed and 
called to her to look at the strange object. When she looked
thru the open bedroom window she saw a large round red object 
and having no sound. She said the object would stop perfectly
still then make a very slow movement. At this time the object
began to move slowly fas
ter and repeated this movement several times, then would stop
.
Then it began to move faster, moving from right to left and
from left to right, up and down, 1 observed that it would
stop just for an instant, then go straight down to the same
level that it began, stop just for an instant, then repeat
this many times. It looked almost as if it were making a
square pattern, but the square was not an exact square. 
After moving 20" to 25" in azimuth it was reversed and made
the same square movement back to the starting point and down.
It appeared to increase and decrease in brightness and change
direction 90°. After returning to approxi-mately the starting
point the object then began to move faster, from left to right
and back, then paused, all within one second. After this flash
back and forth, it continued to move to the right, moving
faster than entering. As it passed behind a pine tree, measured
600' from the house, the top portion could be seen thru the tree
. Since beginning to watch the object, it stayed rectangular to
her, but tilted away from her. She stated that the object looked
rectangular to her.
(5) When the object, moving to the left, came out from behind
the tree, it appeared much smaller. This time it had a red
glow and seemed almost transparent. As it came nearer, it
appeared as they became aware of the sound of the engines of
an airliner approaching from the west, which then overheadand droned on to the east. Before the sound of the engines
faded a jet passed overhead. The object did not reappear. 
(6) The object was visible for about ten minutes.
Manner of observation:
(1) Ground - visual, thru open window, window glass, and thru
screen wire.
(2) Binoculars were used by her husband and the (rectangular
almost oval) object just became more distinct and brighter.

No air traffic at Keesler AFB or Gulfport Municipal airport from several hours before sighting until the next morning.
Capt Charles O. Williams, SAGE Weapons Controller Course, OGBD#4b, measured the distance to the targets and established that they were 10-12 miles away from the observer. The witness said "Approximately 10 years ago I had seen anything like this before." He stopped the truck he was driving and observed them for approximately 30 seconds.
I have not been able to determine any possible cause for this sighting. There were no balloons, search lights, or fireworks. There were no aircraft. There were no temperature inversions.

UFO Sighting of 20 July 1962 (Ocean Springs Sighting)
30 January 1963

Dear Sir,

I am writing from Wright-Patterson where the boys are trying to close up the 1962 UFO sightings. They would appreciate it very much if you could send them an account of the sighting on 20 July 1962.

I believe you said you had talked to these people and had communicated with the director. Some of them have been in correspondence with Lt Col Robert Friend, AFSC TD-3 (UFO) WPAFB, Ohio, as you know the sighting might have some bearing on the whole matter.

I hope to see you in Las Cruces.

Cordially,
