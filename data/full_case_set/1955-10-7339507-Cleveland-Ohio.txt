The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text describing a UFO sighting.

Text from the image:

(1) Sighting: Two miles west of intersection of Route 6 and 306. Between 1:30 to 2:00 a.m.
Object: Typically "flying saucer" in shape. Thirty feet across. Dome on top. A belt of green light struck the ground in front of it, open and swept to the rear. In English, "they" were from another planet.

(2) Sighting: Late July or early August (date indefinite) 1955. North of Mulberry Corner (Int. Route 6 and 306). 8:45 p.m.
Object: Size described as larger than house, and as flat, circular in shape. Hovered about fifty feet in the air for about five minutes. Two red lights on top, one larger green light underneath. Object then drifted away.

(3) Sighting: Cleveland, Ohio. Over 105th St. 
Object: Circular, bright orange glow, 500 feet off the ground. A shining from the bottom of the object towards the earth.

(4) Sighting: 22 October 1955, South Euclid, Ohio. 7:15 p.m.
Object: Large, wide as average house. Made gruff coarse noise. Seemed to be controlled in high, how of yellow lights around.
Results of Interviews: (1) Sighting: Proceeded to the house of person the witnesses, a 7:45 hours on 29 June 1955, with his foster mother, Mrs. Ellish. He produced some interesting information regarding this case. Additional details that he claims to recall after two years.

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document discussing a UFO sighting incident.

Results of Interview:
(1) Have seen the landing of the "saucer"; talked to the person who emerged from within it, and who gave him a message in English to the effect that communication is attempted, and that they (the saucers) are peaceful and friendly. Was advised to tell his story to the authorities. The message was delivered as "this is the most important event of your life".
(2) Sighting: on the evening of the same day (27 June) 1952, the witnesses who are Mr. and Mrs. X watched the sky, and saw a saucer-like object landed on the northwest side of their home. They had made the statement to this investigator almost word for word their previous reports, and in the course of a lengthy interview, had in this particular case reported up this particular case in their report to ATIC. The pictures submitted with this interview are not figures or the UFO sighted are erroneous, according to the opinions of the investigator conducting this interview. Also, some of the drawings of the UFO sighted are erroneous, according the investigator, and do not accurately represent what was actually seen.
(3) Sighting: in the latter part of the day (23 June), an attempt was made to contact the witness who appears to be a member of some kind of scientific organization in question. Inasmuch as Mr. X was not at home, the investigator was told that he was out of town, and had been instructed by Mr. X not to divulge any information concerning this incident. The investigator was left with the impression that Mr. X is sincere and unusual man, and was in insurance.

CONCLUSIONS:
A. OBSERVATIONS: This investigator did observe some unusual or unexplainable phenomena, but it is impossible to determine positively their nature and the cause. The witness talked to him in such a way that he now believes or alleges he believes this phenomenon occurred as described. However, his allegations are impossible oc investigate conclusively.
10. CASE: This was the only case of the four that did not disclose any discrepancies between the original UFO report. No firm or definite conclusion can be made due to lack of further information and the difficulty of getting additional details from the interview of the witness skipping from the first contact to the landing.
11. CASE: From his obvious susceptibility to suggestion, and description of his sightings "500 feet from the ground", the object is considered an aircraft preparatory to landing, and will be listed in this category.
12. CASE: Apparently an aircraft, but insufficient information.
13. GENERAL: All the individuals associated with the UFOSIG appeared to be people who, although good American citizens, have vivid imaginations and sincerely believe they are making the true discoveries of investigations from this organization.

Forward

We of the U.F.O.R.G. are civilians interested in the security of these United States. We operate on a non-profit basis and the time of our investigators is donated. Two of our members are civilians associated with these investigations of flying object sightings as they occur in the insurance and business fields. The committee is actually comprised:

We literally stumbled onto a sighting of an unidentified flying object like in 1955 and ever since we have been studying and investigating the matter in the interest of our country's security.

The sighting reports included in this paper are to be considered confidential as they may divulge scientific and technical data indirectly connected with the witness as the witness himself as the witness co-operates with us.

Because the Department of the Air Force has set up the special project "Blue Book" we feel it is our duty as Americans to prepare a complete report of our investigations, findings and conclusions for Air Technical Intelligence Center to aid in further accumulation of intelligence for this serious matter.

As a last word we would like to state that our investigators are firmly convinced that a more thorough study of the areas involved will turn up other past reports and possibly uncover an organized intelligence beyond our present comprehension, not only of a factual character, but also scientific facts that may or may not account for the unusual behavior in this one case.

                                                                   Director

Case File Number One
On October 22, 1955 I was driving north on Kemper Road (in Cleveland) when a girl friend. As I approached the intersection of Kemper and Fairhill at about 9:20 P.M. I noticed for the first time a light in the sky. It was directly overhead a silver ball type object. It was stationary at that point and my girl friend and the two of us watched the object. Suddenly the object seemed to accelerated very rapidly. I stopped the car to get a better view and the object seemed to disappear into the night sky. I immediately reported this incident to other investigators of the UFORC. The report was filed but not much was done about it, and it seems that no real conclusions were ever reached in the matter. On the following evening, October 23, 1955 I received a phone call at my home from a UFORC member called me to report a remarkable sighting over the Southern end of my home town. The person telling me this reported that he had just watched the same type of object the night before and that he was convinced after seeing it again that there was something very unusual about it.
"My name is W.  I am 28 years old, married and have one child - I was for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Cleveland 15, Ohio. 
On the night of October 22nd, 1955, while I was working in the basement of my home at 14404 Woodland Ave., Cleveland, Ohio, I became aware of a bright light through a window located on the west side of the basement. When I looked out I saw a craft, a bright silver, round object hovering over the west corner of Woodland and Woodhill Roads in the neighborhood. The object was approximately 1000 ft. above the ground and appeared to be 30-40 ft. in diameter. It was moving silently and I watched it continuously for about 5 minutes. It then accelerated away at a fantastic speed toward the west. The object seemed to tilt, shift and turn at various degree angles. It swept across the west door of the Technical Center Building and out of sight to the west. It was located on the side of a small shanty on the north side of the Technical Center.
Approximately while walking halfway to the shanty, the object began to glow with a brilliant light and as I approached the object closer, the light grew in intensity and seemed to pulsate. Suddenly I heard a loud noise like a very high pitched whistle. I observed a few searchlights circling the city. Suddenly the object seemed to shoot a stream of flame from its side and it accelerated away at a fantastic speed. It looked like it extended an average man's length away from the object when it took off. It leaned over at a 45 degree angle to the ground and then swept off over west 105th street at the very time it turned on its side it seemed to illuminate the surrounding area. Thereafter, it just disappeared into the west as it flew past.

me further away from the orange unidentified single object and at a higher altitude. The single object then appeared to increase in size and this increase seemed to produce a whistling sound. The orange object, as it turned further off what appeared to be its original course, was traversing toward the east and disappearing from sight. It then continued on toward the earth. It was flying at approxiately 7000 to 7500 feet. 

I then continued my rounds, entering the building as I did constanly my rounds on the inside of the building. I left the building again on the northwest corner and did look toward the direction wherein I had last seen the orange object. It was still visible but appeared to be fluttering at a very slow rate of speed. It seemed to flutter into the distance and disappear from sight. I watched it until it disappeared again over the horizon. It was flying at approxinately 1000 to 1200 feet.

I returned to the building and phoned this sight-into the night light division who told me to stand by while they notified the proper agencies over his matter

After listening to over the telephone report you iven, as detects what further steps could be taken on this matter, as you have stated that actual sightings were observed and the details concerning an unusual object flying over his home. The object was first observed at 7:00 or 7:15 p.m. on October 22, 1955 by your wife, who went outside and faced east. Object was flying low and moving slowly, and made a humming sound. It traveled from the western horizon toward the east and was in her view for approximately one-half minute.

Object was as wide as the average house, low, moving slowly, and made a humming sound as it traversed in a straight line, but described as being irregular in outline or some parts and slightly dimmer or brighter than others. It divided into two sections, upper and lower, and at that time the lower section disappeared or seemed to be lost from sight, but the upper section continued onward. As it reached treetop height and looked as if it were coming down, it then arose again higher and disappeared over the eastern horizon.

Believing that the sightings reported might be related, and in view of the fact that the objects involved were unusual and not in accordance with the C.A.A.'s altitude laws, then I would suggest that the following steps be taken:

Sound: No sound. Altitude: Was it 200 feet high? No, hell, no. Just as high as any plane.
Lights: Only wing or tail lights? No, just the yellow lights.
We all watched out and watched it and we did not get excited about it. (Though it had something to do with the football game, (he thought looked like a comet high up, south to north - seemed to be chased it, went east, with ends south to north - pushed it to east, to show how the lights moved.)
Note: .... sighting was near this location.

Does the blimp have green and red port lights? Yes, they are inside and can be seen from the bascindg. can cause cold color: the green and red lights while flashing might give the impression of something unusual.

C. Mr. Goodyear Wingfoot Airship Base, Akron,O.

Thursday, Oct. 27, 1955
If you saw a row of yellow lights as you looked up from your house, would you take it to be a blimp?
No. You might see some light in a blimp, but it would be pretty dim.
Did you have a blimp out that night?
No.
Any other blimp base in the general area?
Not that I know. We used to have one in Detroit last year.
Would that blimp be required to carry red and green lights as standard equipment?
Yes. It also had a sign on the side - we have these advertising frames; if you have 30 lights in a row, you can get, such, a view of 30 lights in a row.
Would green and red lights be required and usable?
Yes - these distance (long) you might not see them.

D. Mr. Night Traffic, Cleveland Air Taxi,Inc.,
Nov. 1, 1955
Our helicopters are grounded after 5:30 p.m.
Do they make a vibratory noise?
They make a slapping noise. Noise can't be heard over 750 feet, normally.

There is no photograph or image present in this shared content. This appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Do they have a row of yellow lights?
No.
Do they have red and green running lights?
Yes, a green, red and yellow flashing lights.
By the description of witnesses and our investigation, then, we know the object is luminous, Probably 500 ft. in diameter, and stationary. As a last measure, we took the case file to the Air Force for closer analysis. 
"Thursday, November 13, 1955 - Sgt. Lee" after hearing my report, called the Olden detachment and told them I heard their report and can stand by what I said. With an explanation to the sighting however, further analysis was needed for the last time. He had this to say:
"Well, it seems what you saw was an unidentified flying object, Most certainly Unidentifiable from your account. This was quite strange and unusual phenomena, which nevertheless defies any further reasonable explanation from your account. If this is really what you saw, then no civilian or military authorities can otherwise say this was just a mistake." 
However, we have orders to release nothing on it. It will be sent on to higher authorities at Wright Field."

In Conclusion
We of the Unidentified Flying Object Research Council are not fantasy-minded people nor are we casually fooled. We recognize that a great deal of effort and a great deal of truth-which-may-be-error is being expended in the analysis of these case files as thoroughly as it is possible for civilianized research. Some of the conclusions may be subject to considerable data fill substractions and limitations.
Our primary concern is the security and defense of American. It is our conclusion that these unidentified flying objects COULD be a possible threat. We are however certain that they are no immediate danger to us. We are also sure that we have no defense against them as they are superior to anything this country has produced.
The UFORG believes that some type of defensive action against the phenomenon might be necessary. At least the public should be informed of this potential danger. We do not say that aircraft alien to this planet are moving close to our property nor do we say that the sightings actually pose a threat for any unprepared people.
The air force report on UFO's, released by Secretary Connally in study is so sensitive that copies of it have not been made available for our research. But members of our organization have knowledge of this study. We believe that the objects such as those which the United States' radar have seen many times are not "hallucinations" as some of our scientists would have us believe, but members of other worlds - other civilizations. There is no evidence that unidentified flying objects DO EXIST.
All of the persons mentioned in this report are ready and willing to be questioned at any time. As for the UFORG, we are sure of our conclusions and will be glad to do so.
