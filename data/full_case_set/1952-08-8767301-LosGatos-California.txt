The image does not appear to contain any photographs. Based on the text in the document, it seems to be an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Estimate of 200-220 Mile per hour speed was made because there was very little lag to the sound and this object disappeared over mountains approximately five miles to the west of observation point.

I have been closely interested in aircraft for a long time, especially military, and I have a man who is a navy flyer as a close friend. Our further qualifications as an observer are that I was a technician on very and Air Corps (air 2) training and identification films of aircraft that were used in WW2. Also, I did main flying in private planes many years ago.

I give you this information so that it will not be rated as a verghot-headed look trying for publicity, and so that this report will have some meaning.

Additionally: This questionnaire was not received by me until September 10th, and the envelope had been opened and the enclosed self-addressed envelope removed before I got it.
