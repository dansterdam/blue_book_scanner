This page does not contain any photographs. It appears to be text from a Project Blue Book report regarding an investigation that took place in Stillwater, Oklahoma on July 7-8, 1952.

The text describes the details of the investigation, including the involvement of Special Agent J. W. Vallin and the observations made by witnesses. It mentions the sighting of two objects on the highway, the apparent disappearance of a dead animal, and the subsequent investigation and reporting.

UNCLASSIFIED
DETAILS:
This investigation was predicated upon information received telephonically from Special Agent WILLIAM S. HIGDON, Atlanta, Georgia concerning sighting of unidentified flying objects near Stillwater, Oklahoma the night of 7-8 July 1952.
AT ATLANTA, GEORGIA
The following portion of the investigation was conducted by Special Agent J. W. VALLIN, Atlanta.
At 0855 hours on 8 July 1953, Special Agent VALLIN, Atlanta Field Office, conducted an investigation, telephonically contacting the Atlanta Detachment, 0th District OSI, and advised Special Agent WAUGH of the details. SPECIAL AGENT WAUGH advised that he had been contacted by Special Agent HIGDON of the Stillwater Resident Agency, Eighth Air Force, who had received the following information given to him on 7 July 1952 by the following:
The two (2) individuals were driving on the Gainesville Highway (U. S. Highway 23) near Crabapple, Georgia when three (3) objects were observed on the highway. They stopped their vehicle to observe the objects, which immediately disappeared. One of the objects disappeared upward and the other two (2) went off in the object, which immediately disappeared.
SPECIAL AGENT VALLIN further stated that he had been told the 231st hike troopers brought the dead animal to the Atlanta Constitution (10 Forsyth Building, Atlanta, Georgia) where a veterinarian had examined it and pronounced it to be a coyote. SPECIAL AGENT VALLIN interviewed the veterinarian, who stated that he had never seen such an animal before. In his call to GSI, Special Agent VALLIN told them of the upward disappearance of the objects and stated that the information had been given to the FBI, according to AGENT HIGDON.
At 1000 hours on 8 July 1953, Special Agent JAMES M. WARD briefly interviewed the two (2) individuals who had observed the objects. They advised that they were driving on the Gainesville Highway (U.S. 23) near Crabapple, Georgia when the three (3) objects had just driven over a hill. The objects were described as being about 30 feet in diameter, silver in color, and one jumped for the moving road object and that two got on the object and the third one stayed with the animals and that the animals were identified as coyotes. The individuals stated that there were no other witnesses and that the animals did not appear to be affected in any way.

6. At 1515 hours, 8 July 1953, Captain XXXXXX was telephonically contacted at the Intelligence Section, 29th Air Division, Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia. He advised that at approximately 1100 hours, 8 July 1953, the following sightings occurred at Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia: XXXX XXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX

The Atlanta Constitution, Atlanta, Georgia, dated 9 July 1953, page twelve (12), contained an article which identified the dead animal as a monkey, which had been removed from the area. This article revealed that the story was developed as a result of a $10.00 bet with a friend that he could not get his picture in the paper. He was fined $40.00 for obstructing the highway and released at that time.

The image appears to contain a photograph of some unidentified aerial phenomenon. The text describes two elliptical-shaped white lights that were observed, with the object able to be covered by the observer's thumb at arm's length. The object was reported to disappear and then return, possibly indicating a short trail. The lights were said to become dimmer and then brighter again, and appeared to be like a ceiling light from a long distance. No further details about the nature or identity of the object are provided.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report or document, possibly from Project Blue Book, that describes an observation of an unidentified object. The text in the document is as follows:

9 July 1953

The following information was obtained by long distance telephone from Mrs. Lyle Coonradt, 1621 Old Town Place, Colorado Springs, Colorado. This information was given to me by Mrs. Coonradt on 25 July 1953.

1. As close as I could say it was elliptical, a dull white light, somewhat larger than a weather balloon. It was about 300 yards from me and about 500 feet elevation, moving in an arc from northeast to southwest. It was silent, appeared to be glowing and was a limited and irregular shape. The thing that would throw up a slight haze was the way the light seemed to oscilliate or pulsate. This pulsation lasted appr-oximately 30 minutes.

2. I may this object at approx-imately 2300 (11 pm) on 6 July 1953. I observed this object for approximately 1/2 hour.

3. I observed it from the ground with the naked eye.

4. I was outside on the ground at Cordell Call, Oklahoma. It was on the northern edge of a field approximately 1/4 mile from my residence. This field was located in the North Central part of Stillwater, Oklahoma.

5. I have two (2) years experience as Ground Observer Corps observer with the Stillwater Filter Center. I have approximately one hundred (100) hours in the air.

6. Further around towards North from 120° from East on up to North to the Northeast (about 150°) there was OME down to the horizon.

7. Meteorological condition is unknown.

8. I did not take any pictures and did not obtain any fragments.

9. There was no interference to my knowledge.

10. There was no aircraft in the air to the best of my knowledge.

- page 17 -

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or report discussing a UFO sighting.

The text of the document is as follows:

The following is a summation was obtained by long distance telephone from witnesses at Stillwater, Oklahoma, this morning:

1. Apparently remaining in control was Corporal ---as indicated on the document

2. Met I saw looked like two (2) bright lights that seemed to have some kind of connection between them, though they were some distance apart. The object or objects were first observed when one of the girls called the attention of the others to it. We watched them for several minutes and they seemed to move farther and farther apart until they disappeared from view. There was no sound nor did they appear to give off any lign to speak of, and they were of an unusual shape. This particular object had a peculiar type of blinking light within it that puzzled us considerably. I saw this for a few minutes until it gradually faded out. This object was not at all like an airplane. it was peculiar in shape - not circular but more like a rectangle with rounded corners, elongated and not much greater in width than in depth, without apparent appendages or protrusions. The whole thing appeared to be self-luminous, glowing faintly. It seemed to be slowly moving up and down in a vertical plane and gyrating in such a way that the blinking light was not always visible from our angle of observation. It seemed to be a distance over the city, perhaps 2 miles or more. The whole sighting lasted about 3 minutes.

2. I have this at approximately 2200 (10:00 PM) on 3 July 1953.

3. I observed these with the naked eye.

4. I was watching through the second story or the dormitory. There was a person on the window and the sighting was spotty, the objects appearing and disappearing from time to time.

5. I have had no experience observing aircraft. I was in the group of forces of the service for thirty-three (33) months.

6. I did not take any pictures.

7. I don't know anything about meteorology.

8. I did not take any pictures.

9. I don't remember hearing or seeing any aircraft in the air on that particular night.
