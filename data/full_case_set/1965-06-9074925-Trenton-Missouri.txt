This is to report a mysterious sighting which I saw in the sky at SAM tonight. At about 10:30 PM I have watching the skies and reports from others who might have also seen the same but just today I made mention in the Kansas City paper of observations and to the effect that you have a list of 557 sightings which are unidentified). -

I will start by saying that at the time and place mentioned above I was working in the yard in the northeast corner of my home at 509 East 10th Street, Trenton, Missouri, Grundy County, and when a slight but suddenly appearing object seemed to appear over southeast of my home where it seemed to stand still, then suddenly go into a motion and appear again a little to the northeast to west. It reminded me of a car light shining in, but realizing that that was impossible in the upper atmosphere, I soon recognized that that was something unusual.

To my knowledge no one else could have seen this as I was the only one outside at that time. I did not make any sound as it would be impossible to do so, I am sure. In the northeast I saw a fiery glow about the size of three full moons and it gave the impression that the sky was on fire. As I watched it appeared to roll and jerk and send out what looked like flames, but it did not move any closer to where I was standing and after about ten minutes began to slowly move to the ground, nor have I seen any original location. 

To my knowledge no one else could have witnessed this. I did not see account of it in our local paper nor hear of any one else seeing it. I did not call any of the neighbors as they would not have been up although my 87 year old father was the only other person in the home of my household. And I did not wish to leave the window but to wait until I could overnight. 

If you have other reports similar or know what I may have seen I would appreciate the information. I might add that I am 57 years old and have served in the Korean conflict and am now employed as a custodian in the northeast schools. This is my first report of this kind. I have not submitted it to the newspaper but to your attention, hoping an explanation can be offered.

Most sincerely,

The text in the "BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS" section describes the observed object as three times the size of the moon on the horizon in the Northeast. It states that the object was so bright that it hurt the observers' eyes, and the sky looked like it was on fire. The object appeared to roll and jerk and flames shot upward, and it gradually died down after being watched for 10 minutes.

Reference the attached letter from Mrs H G Rains reporting an unidentified object which she observed on the morning of 23 Jun 65. The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear Mrs Rains,
We have received your letter, in which you describe the observation of an object on the morning of 23 Jun 65. Based on the information provided, the object was traveling in a northerly direction at an elevation of approximately 060 degrees. Your letter does not mention the duration of the sighting or any other details concerning the position of the object which you observed. From the information which you have submitted, the Air Force tends to agree with your son's analysis of your observation. We also believe that you may have the sun rising in the northeast.

We have received no additional reports from this area on 23 Jun 65.

Dear Mrs. Rains:

This is in reply to your letter in which you described your observation of an object on the morning of 22 June 1965.

Based on the data which you submitted, the Air Force tends to agree with your contention that you may have seen a sun rising in the northeast even though you did not mention the position of the sun with relation to the position of the object which you observed. Sunrise occurred at Trenton, Missouri, on that date at 5:19 am on a heading of 060 degrees.

Sincerely,

This is to report a mysterious sight which I saw in the sky at Sam'S farm close to Trenton. I was unable to watch the papers for reports from others who might have also seen the same, but just today a neighbor mentioned in the Kansas City paper, about a vigorous observation and a statement that you have a list of 359 sightings which are unidentified.

I am a start-by starving farmer. That is the time and I mentioned above I was awake but still in bed in the northeast corner upstairs room of my home at 2:30 east, local street, Trenton, (Clinton County), when a very bright light suddenly appeared on the west wall of my room. If it had been car light shining in, but realizing that that was impossible in the upstairs room, I got up and went to the west window to investigate. Through the window I saw three circular objects full of light and they were accompanied by a fourth, smaller one. They were light beside side and it gave me the impression that the sky was on fire. As I watched it gradually disappeared and took about ten minutes until it was completely gone. But it did not fall to the ground - nor did any of the surrounding motor move from its original position. 

To my knowledge no one else in this community saw this. I did not see any account of it in our local paper nor any one else seeming to see it. I did not call any of the neighbors as they would not yet have been up that early and my telephone call might only have upset them.

Until it disappeared or I could decide what it might be, I did not move from the window. And I did not wish to leave the window but to watch until it disappeared, or I could decide what it might be.

If you have other reports similar or know what I may have seen, I would appreciate the information. A Mr. Edwin C. Neff who lives in Cincinnati, Ohio wrote that he had seen the sun rising in the northeast - but he is mistaken. I have seen the sun rise many times and there is no comparison. (I am 57 years old).

Most sincerely,
Mrs. M. J. (Bertha) Rainier
