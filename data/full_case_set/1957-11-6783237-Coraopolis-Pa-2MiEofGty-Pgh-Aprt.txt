TO: COMMANDER, 4TH FIGHTER GROUP, AD, CORAOPOLIS, PENNSYLVANIA
REFERENCE YOUR UFO REPORT, PS-42-INT, 25-NOV-57.  REQUEST FOLLOW-UP TO OBTAIN MORE CONCLUSIVE DATA AND TO POSITIVELY IDENTIFY OBJECT OBSERVED BY SOURCE.  REASON FOR THIS IS TO PREVENT REPETITION OF LARGE MASS OF REPORTS, ISSUE CALLS AND ADVERSE NEWSPAPER PUBLICITY TO AIR FORCE AS RESULT OF THE RECENT KEARHEY, LEVELLAND AND WHITE SANDS INCIDENTS. NORMAL INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES, COMMUNICATIONS AND CHANNELS DISRUPTED AS RESULT.  VERY PUZZLING THAT SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT 25 FEET IN DIAMETER WITH BLINKING RED AND BLUE LIGHTS HOVERED 150 FEET ABOVE GROUND OVER OR IN VICINITY OF BUSY AIRPORT AND NOT OBSERVED BY OTHER AIRCRAFT.  YET NO REPORTS OF ANY UNUSUAL OBJECT FROM OTHER RADAR UNITS, AIRCRAFT OR PERSONS IN THAT AREA WITHIN TIME GIVEN.  FACT THAT SILENCE IS MAINTAINED SIGNIFICANT TO THAT FIGHTER GROUP.  IF RELEASED TO PRESS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY TRIGGER OFF ANOTHER RASH OF UFO REPORTS.
