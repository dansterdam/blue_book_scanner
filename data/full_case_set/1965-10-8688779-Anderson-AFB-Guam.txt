UNCLASSIFIED

FAA CONTROLLERS HAVE WITNESSED THIS PHENOMENA. MR. WILFRIE F. GERKIN, AGE 53, ADDRESS: GUAM CERAP, C/O FAA, ROUTE 003, AGANA, GUAM, SUPERVISORY AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SPECIALIST, IS RECOMMENDED AS THE MOST QUALIFIED OBSERVER. ALL FAA OBSERVERS ARE CONSIDERED HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND RELIABLE. (O) WEATHER CONDITIONS NOT CONSIDERED AS A FACTOR DUE TO RADAR BEACON RETURNS. (1) ONLY OTHER UNUSUAL ACTIVITY OR CONDITION IS THE FACT THAT THE SOVIET TRAWLER, IZMERITEL, IS MAINTAINING STATION OFF THE COAST OF GUAM. (2) INTERCEPTION ACTIONS AS REPORTED. (3) NO BALLOON RELEASES AND NO OTHER KNOWN TRAFFIC IN THE AREA EXCEPT AS REPORTED. (4) PREPARING OFFICER IS LT COL HOWARD R. SCHROEDER, FR15510, CHIEF, COMBAT INTELLIGENCE DIVISION, DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS AS REPORTED PREVIOUSLY. (1) NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT SEEMS TO CORROBORATE THIS PHENOMENON. BUT AT PRESENT ARE UNABLE TO EXPLAIN THIS PHENOMENON. REQUEST ANY INFO YOU MAY HAVE WHICH WOULD ASSIST IN INVESTIGATION. GP3

The document appears to describe a UFO sighting witnessed by FAA air traffic controllers and investigated by the U.S. Air Force as part of Project Blue Book. It notes that the sighting occurred near Guam and involved unusual activity by a Soviet trawler, but does not contain any photographic evidence.

1. (S) The information included in YEA message COND/NO FORM/DI: 
03227 was reviewed, and the following comments are submitted:

2. (C) The data as submitted does not provide adequate analysis
of individual manifestations on the radar scope and normal
interferance effects are not discussed. Without such analysis,
in assessing the situation.

3. (C) The overall situation, as a whole, several facts
appear obvious on the face of the report:
a) Where visual observation are credible, they provide
confirmatory evidence that unusual real objects were clearly
visible to observers. This would substantiate that if physical
objects are detected on the radar, those detections are valid
(This is supported by the number of witnesses co-locating the
same visual and radar target).
b) The fact that rapid maneuvering was observed, as indicated
by the report, would suggest that the objects detected were not
normal aircraft under controlled flight. Such maneuvering
would be indicative of advanced flight capabilities beyond
normal aircraft performance.
c) The fact that the objects were observed to approach and
depart the vicinity at high speed, as stated, would also suggest
advanced flight characteristics considerably beyond current
aircraft performance.
It is reasonable that maintenance of the classification
status on the details of this incident is prudent, as release
of this information could be prejudicial to national interests.

(S) Simultaneous loss of the target by several radar and visual observers, and loss of the intelligence signal which would ordinarily have been recorded to confirm and changes in attitude can sometimes be attributed to the geometry of the reflecting or refracting pattern.

(S) The presence of the Soviet crawler is not believed to play a role in the cessation, if the sightings originated in this manner the presence would be expected to provide further additional data, which would tend to validate the observation. Obviously, this does not eliminate the possibility that the satellite solar panels could have produced the visual sightings, but the passage and the presence would not be logical and probably not be considered.

HAD EXIT HDG 310 DEGREES PLUS MINUS 10 DEGREES. ECHO. APPARENT

THE C-97 WAS VR AT 4,500 FEET, SAME ALTITUDE AS MEASURED AT THAT TIME FOR THE BEACON MENDENSON, AND PASSED DIRECTLY OVER IT OR INTO IT TWICE WITHOUT VISUAL CONTACT. PART IV. AN ADDITIONAL INTERCEPT ATTEMPT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO DATE, WAS MADE 27 JUN 65, AT 1443Z (23/0945 LOCAL) BY AN ANDERSON AFB RESCUE SQUADRON C-130, CALL SIGN FILE 74, EQUIPPED WITH APS-59. PILOTS WERE CAPT JOE KRAUPKA AND CAPT PETE GLEESON; VERY RELIABLE AND OBJECTIVE OBSERVERS. CONTACT WAS MAINTAINED FOR TWENTY MINUTES AT APPROX 2,000 FEET, AND NUMEROUS INTERCEPTS WERE ATTEMPTED. IT WAS A CLOSE MOONLIT NIGHT WITH SCATTERED CUMULUS AT ABOUT 10,000 FEET. LEVEL WHICH WAS TOO THIN TO PAINT ON THE RADAR. FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT ITEMS WERE REPORTED BY THE FLIGHT CREW: ALFA. THE CREW USED "PENCIL BEAM" ON THEIR APS-59 RADAR, GIVING ACCURATE HOMING CAPABILITY. BRAVO. RADAR CONTRACT MADE RANGED FROM 6-9NM. THE RETURN WAS IN THE FORM OF A NARROW SERIES OF DOTS SUCH AS AN ELECTRICAL IMPULSE WOULD GIVE. IT WAS APPROX ONE NM LONG ON THE SCOPE AND ALWAYS ORIENTED IN LINE WITH THE CENTER OF THE RADAR SCOPE.

WHENEVER THEY TRIED TO SPOT IT VISUALLY IT WAS ALWAYS IN A CLOUD. ECHO. THE TARGET WAS LOST TO BOTH THE FAA AND AIRBORNE RADAR AT THE SAME TIME, 1512Z. AT THAT TIME IT WAS 322/55NM FROM ANDERSEN AFB.

THE FIRST RETURN APPEARED TO ORIGINATE FROM A SURFACE VESSEL AT 1445Z. ONLY REPORTED INCIDENT OF THIS RETURN MOVED AWAY AND WERE AT ANDERSEN 322/55 AND 322/54 WHEN CONTACT WAS LOST ON BOTH OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME, 1492Z.
