Attached is a report of the C.I.O.V.I. (Center for Investigating Unidentified Flying Objects) concerning a case received 7 July 1958.
This report was given to this office by the Chief of Intelligence, Uruguayan Air Force, on orders of the Director of the UAF. The C.I.O.V.I. is a civilian investigation group. The reports whose purpose is to render an investigation of flying objects are prepared for other than Uruguayan Air Force. The UAF, however, professes no interest to be the only recipient of its other than furnishing to them to the United States Air Force interested in these reports.

COMMENT: All reports of unidentified flying objects have excited intense public interest and extensive press coverage. This is the first incident, however, which has been considered to be worthy of investigation.

REPORT OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE CENTER OF INVESTIGATING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (CIOVL): July 1958. 
This investigating committee, after holding five special meetings to consider this case, where all the proper technical investigations finds it necessary to make the following remarks:

CONSIDERATIONS: 
1) That the object observed was in the Republic which extends from the Department of Rocha to the Department of Soriano. The observers indicated some changes in position with respect to this object.

2) That the observers agree that it was a spheric object (except the observation which at its path illuminating vast extensions and which at its path illuminating vast extensions and which indicated six and color of the object).

1) That in spite of that, the light that it gave was a bluish white, it did not produce sparks and does not illuminate the object; a distance of more than 60 kilometers, making all the objects of the same color.
2) That one person who lived Pan de Azúcar reported that the population of the zone confirmed that when the light passed over the area it produced a tremendous noise, they commented on this fact, giving it importance.
3) Some of our suggestion to the field was to find if any sound was heard, this person agreed that it was around 11:30.
4) At 11:13 an AIR FRANCE plane reported to the authorities of Carrasco Airport, indicating that they had observed a strange luminosity over the zone, since the phenomenon that took place at 20:30 according to a report made.
5) The people which were in this moment at the airport could hear a strange sound and see the luminosity.
6) That persons who were on the observation terrace reported that they had heard a noise similar to that described by the residents 16 km de Sauce to Minas, kilometer 76, an object of different characteristics than those described above (as it is stated on the corresponding report), having certain physical effects of which

there are antecedents in other parts of the world.
1) That by the aircraft which has been exposed, this case has very special characteristics which make it difficult to understand in all its complex phenomenon, elements of which make it difficult to explain and appear to certain aspects that this object presents which are considered isolated.
This investigation committee has arrived at the following conclusions:
1) That the object seen in Montevideo, San José and Soriano is the same (according to the previous study of the observers).
2) That this object performed maneuvers which reveal that it was directed by an intelligence.
3) That the C.O.V.E. stated publicly by the press (without stating a deposit that maintains that it was a natural phenomenon such as a meteorite or a thunderstorm, which were the theories of local scientists).
4) That the difference in the appreciation of the size of the object is due to the distance of the observers with respect to the same.
5) That the object changed color (which, according to one of the most widespread theories, would be the product of the method used for its propulsion, electromagnetism).

1) That the luminosity which this object emits is phenomenon difficult to explain due to its peculiar characteristics.
2) That taking into consideration its luminosity and the sound which it sometimes produces, this could be the same thing which appeared on the afternoon of the same day.
3) That the sound as well as something similar to sparks or bubbles which were emitted on certain paths would be phenomenon produced by a special type of propulsion which has not been created by man up to this date.
4) That everything which has been reported in this connection has the characteristics of an unidentified flying object although it is similar to the "UFO-FIGHTERS" observed by the pilots in the second world war.

NOTES:
The pilots of both sides reported, after returning from fighter and bomber missions, that strange trails of different sizes and colors could accompany the movements of the flying objects, and that the opinion of the military authorities was that it concerned a secret weapon of the opposite side. But after the war this was contradicted and such phenomena continued.

10) That the observation of Mr. ---- and family is a different case within the same day as 11) that evidently that which occurred to these persons happened at the same time as 11) has been discussed.
12) That the object seen by the mission with a field of action more reduced than that of the other unidentified was fulfilling some specific mission within a field of action and for the topographical characteristics of the place in which the facts occurred this can be rigorously observed, it is possible to observe what occurred. It is necessary to point out that the tremendous luminosity of the phenomenon observed and the maneuvers of the luminosity give rise to the suspicion that the object may have been performing a special mission.
13) That there are antecedents in different parts of the world, especially in the United States and in Brazil, which respect to the annunciations verified which is to the same characteristics of those called flying objects and confirmed by the observers (Mr. ---- and family) confirms such statements.

Mr. ___ That this was the cause for the annulment of the electrical system in
Note: This is a strong statement to indicate that there were two objects
since only one was seen, the other object cannot be classed as a disturbance, that this did
not happen to witness the passage of the objects, even if this is very
low altitude. That the physical effects that were expressed could have a
radioactive origin.
That the object was also controlled by an intelligence since it made a
maneuver.
That the blue extension which was emitted from the center of the object
which later exploded producing a ripping sound has antecedents concerning color
and the explosive characteristics.
That the luminosity in this case could not only be due directly to the
disturbance caused by the study but also to this study and which made
its passage by that locality (Mr. ___ observation) at the same time.
That Mr. ___ and Mrs. ___ report, the "glow" was nevertheless antiluminous.

21) That due to all the exposed characteristics, this flying object discloses an unidentified
flying object type flying saucer whose dimensions were approximately at
20 or 30 meters.
NOTE: This investigating committee does not consider this case finished
with this study since if there are any other alternatives they would be added and
a new recommendation of the same would take place.
