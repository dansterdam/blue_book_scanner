Dear Sir:
History
                They seemed to be watching the journey of the car. when I had my binoculars again they were gone. This happened rapidly and seemed to indicate the ability to turn on and off some form of power (jet or rocket assisted). The object seemed to be cigar-shaped and changed from a point of light to a blurred outline and back again, maintaining the same general shape. I believe the object seen was not a distant star or planet because of the rapid changes from bright to dim and the ability to maneuver. It is difficult to give an accurate description. The report is based on what was observed by my 12-year-old son and myself in a rural area about 10 miles north of Baltimore early in the evening of April 7, 1964.

Text from the document:

May 19, 1964

Dear Mr. -

This is in reply to your recent letter in which you reported unusual objects on your television screen. These strange objects were, but our technicians assume that it was some unusual type of interference which caused peculiar objects to flash on the set. As you know, outside interference from electrical motors in your neighborhood could cause your television set to display these patterns, and there is no way to anticipate what form these patterns might take.

Inclosed is an Air Force Fact Sheet on the subject of "Unidentified Flying Objects" which we think will be of interest to you.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
