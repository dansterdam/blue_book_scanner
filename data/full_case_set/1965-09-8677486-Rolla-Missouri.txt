Re USAF RADTCC (Rla Hunt)
Reference is attached letter requesting information on the unidentified observations. The following is a discussed reply:

Dear ras:
We have checked the satellite schedule on the Zcho and those satellites for the night of 4 October 1965 and find that there were a number of satellites in the sky at that time but none of these satellites could have accounted for the observations you described relating to thirty satellites or third magnitude or brighter orbiting the satellite. Thus, whatever you observed, it could not have been any of those other satellites.

As to the sightings of September 14 or 16, it is probable that the observing astronomer was observing a satellite. However, this did not appear moving to the Northwest cannot be associated with that satellite, which would then indicate that a high-flying plane traversing across the sky at dusk could have been the objects you observed.

All known satellites have orbital flights with an easterly component whether Northwest or Southeast and have visual characteristics distinct from what you have described. This Air Force project on unidentified flying objects.

Dear Sir:

Recently, two unidentified flying objects have come to my attention particularly because this area seems to be one of the more active in the country. Their appearance has been frequently reported in newspapers across the country.

The first sighting was on the night of September 16(or possibly the 15, but one of those two days) at 7:00 or 8:00 in the evening(it is not certain). Something was observed in the sky which may or may not have been a star. I thought it was a star larger than I noticed it was moving toward the horizon. It seemed to take about 15 minutes to disappear about 35 toward the horizon where it disappeared. A red narrow object or objects could be seen at times drifting slowly about. This object or objects which followed with it as it coursed toward the northeast horizon where it finally was obscure and disappeared.

The second incident was last Monday, October 4, 1965. At approximately 7:20p.m. my husband and I were driving and observed a white object. It traveled in a straight line (part of a great circle around the earth).

To sum up some obvious conclusions and state some conjectures:

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document.

The text in the document is as follows:

1. Two objects were too high to be planes, their lights steady without blinking.
2. The red object was traveling away from the white object and
3. Could this red object be a reentering capsule of some description? What their sizes were is not clear to me
I hope you can confirm or disconfirm this information and justify their description as it seems my husband's observations.
We would be very interested to know if there is an official record of the sighting and the "reentering capsule". Or is there another more plausible explanation? Thank you.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
