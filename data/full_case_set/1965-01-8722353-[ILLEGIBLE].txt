Dear Major:

There are several things I want to talk about: 
1. I have an unexplained sighting of a bright object, apparently at 6 o'clock on Wednesday April 28. It was very brief - about 5 seconds - because I was watching the television and caught a glimpse of it out of the corner of my eye. It appeared to be traveling from the east to the west across the northern part of the sky. Without warning it accelerated rapidly and disappeared. I would appreciate any information you can give me about this sighting, or any other sightings in this general area during that time period. 
2. I have been studying the UFO problem intensively for some time now and feel I have come to some interesting conclusions. If you are interested, I would be happy to discuss these with you.

Dear Major:

This is in response to a copy of a letter from the 3rd Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force (S-2) dated May 6, 1965, which asked for a report on an incident investigated on January 9, 1965.

I had a long discussion with Dr. J.A. Hynek, our staff astronomer, and I feel that I can give you the full story as we know it, and that I can satisfactorily explain the inconsistencies in the various reports that have been submitted to your office.

We had not seen any large object that this matter was supposed to relate to and that the reports indicated had been observed. The sightings, as far as we are concerned, were of a bright star-like object that was observed for several minutes and which exhibited a pulsating or flickering type of motion. This is not at all unusual and could easily be explained as an astronomical phenomenon. We therefore feel that this case can be classified as an astronomical event and that no further investigation is warranted.

I hope that this report will be satisfactory and that it will clarify the situation. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

J. Allen Hynek
Dearborn Observatory
