2. DETAILS: A letter has been received from Mrs. Elizabeth Wagner, Elba, New York, which states as follows:

Dear Sir,
Since I read the piece in the Buffalo newspaper a couple of weeks ago, I have been meaning to write to you. My husband and I saw an object in the sky from our home on Main Street in Elba, N.Y. on September 19, 1950. It looked like a star, but was moving very fast and unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. It would stop, start, and change direction very rapidly. We watched it for about 30 minutes. Than it just disappeared. We have no idea what it was, but it was certainly no airplane or any celestial body I have ever known. I would appreciate it if you could let me know if this sighting has been reported before and if you have any explanation for it.
Sincerely,
Mrs. Elizabeth Wagner
Elba, N.Y.
