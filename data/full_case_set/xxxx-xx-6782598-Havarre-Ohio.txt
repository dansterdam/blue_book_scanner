BLACK BRANT IIIB ROCKET LAUNCHINGS

A more powerful Black Brant IIIB rocket, built by Bristol Aerospace of Winnipeg, was launched yesterday at 2:26 p.m. EDT by NASA at the Wallops Island, Virginia launch site.

The Canadian rocket, using a higher impulse solid propellant, carried a payload to an altitude of about 135 miles. The present Black Brant III is capable of carrying an 88-pound payload to 114 miles.  

Two of these uprated rockets were scheduled to be fired from Wallops Island for vehicle testing. The first was successfully launched at 1:57 p.m. on February 23.

NASA contracted with the company to modify the existing Black Brant III for a more powerful propellant to enable the rocket to reach altitudes in excess of 200 kilometers with nominal scientific payloads.

Ralph Bullock was the Bristol Aerospace Project Manager. Arthur A. Rudmann was the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Vehicle Manager, and Roger P. Havaree and Robert E. Smith were the NASA Wallops Island Project Engineers.

DAILY WEATHER MAPS

WEEKLY SERIES MAY 12-18, 1969

The lines on this map represent the contours of equal barometric pressure, where the pressure gradients are sufficient to produce motion of the air. This is indicated by the patterns of closed isobars, which show the wind direction and speed at the observational levels.

The Highest and Lowest Pressure figures show the maximum and minimum values in the 48-contiguous-state area for the reporting period, with the observational times at which they occurred.

The precipitation data includes the rainfall, snowfall, and state of the weather. The movement of cyclones, anticyclones, and fronts are shown as dashed lines, and are labeled.

The symbols used on this Daily Weather Map are defined at the bottom of the panel. They describe the observed current weather and compare it to the normal climatological conditions for the same period.

14 March 1952

1. On 14 March 1952 at approximately 2000 hours, this observer noted a round, luminous object of a yellowish-orange color approximately 20 feet in diameter hovering over an open field approximately 1/2 mile west of Havarre, Ohio.

2. The object was first observed at an elevation of approximately 70 degrees above the horizon and remained stationary in that position for approximately 3 minutes. It then began to descend rapidly in a vertical direction, coming to within approximately 50 feet of the ground before suddenly accelerating at a high rate of speed in a horizontal direction to the west, disappearing from view in a matter of seconds.

3. No sound was heard during the observation. Visibility was clear and the night was calm.

4. This observer has had considerable experience in the observation of aircraft and aerial phenomena and is confident that the observed object was not any type of known aircraft or meteorological phenomenon.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
WEATHER BUREAU
WEEKLY SERIES MAY 19-25, 1969
This report is for the period of May 19-25, 1969. The facts presented and the views expressed herein are those of the Weather Bureau and do not necessarily reflect the official position of the Department of Commerce or any other Government agency.
Major Synoptic Features:
The general circulation over the country during this period was dominated by an upper level high pressure system centered over the central Great Plains. This system, which developed early in the period, produced clear skies over most of the central and eastern regions. As the high pressure ridge spread eastward, temperatures gradually increased, reaching near normal or slightly above normal levels by the end of the period. Maximum temperatures during the last few days ranged from the 70's over the northern states to the 80's and 90's over the southern states.
Precipitation was generally light over most of the country, with only scattered showers and thunderstorms occurring, mostly in the southern states. The only significant rainfall occurred in portions of the Southeast, where totals of 1 to 2 inches were recorded.
Severe Weather: 
There were no major severe weather outbreaks reported during the period. A few thunderstorms produced locally heavy rainfall, gusty winds, and hail in some areas, but no widespread damaging storms occurred.

WITNESS STATEMENT

1. Name: 
2. Address: 
3. City, State, Zip: Havarre, Ohio
4. Date and Time of Observation: 20 August 1952, 2:15 P.M.
5. Location of Observation: Route 123, 2 miles west of Havarre, Ohio
6. Weather Conditions: Clear skies, light winds.
7. Description of Sighting:
I was driving my car westbound on Route 123 when I noticed a bright object in the sky to the south. At first I thought it was an aircraft, but as I watched, it began to move in an erratic and unusual manner. It would suddenly change direction and speed, then hover, then dart off again. The object appeared to be circular or disc-shaped and was extremely bright, reflecting the sunlight. I stopped my car to get a better look and observed the object for several minutes before it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view.
8. Additional Comments:
This was a very strange and puzzling sight. I have never seen anything like it before. The object's movements were unlike any aircraft I have seen. I am certain this was not a conventional aircraft, weather balloon, or any other known type of aerial vehicle. I believe I may have witnessed some kind of unidentified flying object.

Mystery in Sky Near Vina
By BOB KENNEDY
A large, bright object, described to be the size of a large car or small bus, was observed hovering over a field near the Wooster Bridge, near Vin
a, early this morning. Tom Kitchen, a ranch hand, reported that while he was working in a field on a tractor shortly after 4 this morning, the large unidentified objecto hovered behind him at treetop level. Tabana County Sheriff Deputies said Kitchen reported that the mysterious object was very bright, accor
ding to reports, Kitchen noticed his re-winding mechanism on his tractor was not working properly, and that the object seemed to be interfering with his tractor through a scope on his rifle. He then notified the sheriff's department, Highway Patrol and the Corning Police Department. Undersheriff Bill Gonzales said this morning that the object ws
sighted when officers arrived at the scene, and thrown high powered handsets, rocks and such, but the object appeared to tolerate these onslaughts without much change in its position and speed, much higher than a large star.
According to eyewit
nesses said Gonzales, the bright object came into the sky and it appeared to shrink, and then it grew to a bright light again, and back again to bright.
In the same general area, several area residents noticed a similar object was seen by two drivers nearby.
According to Gonzales, the deputy said that the object followed a passing train for some distance, then returned to where he was watching. What the bright mysterious object was remains a mystery today.
