The image contains a photograph of a star chart or map. The map shows the relative positions and brightness of various stars, constellations, and objects in the night sky. The title of the image is "Venus Most Prominent" and it discusses the prominence of the planet Venus in the evening sky during the current period. The text in the image appears to be a description of the map and the visibility of Venus.

Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars."

By JAMES STOKEY

When the sun sets in the southwest, night by night these evenings as darkness falls, a bright point of light begins to stand out more and more prominently in the southwest sky. This is the planet Venus, now rapidly approaching its greatest brilliance for the year. 

What is this Venus we see so prominently in the evening sky? What is its significance, and what is the nature of the phenomena associated with it at this season?

Venus, as all of us know, is one of the major planets of our solar system, the one nearest the Earth. Like the other planets, it revolves around the sun, but its orbit is closer to the sun than is the Earth's. This means that as Venus makes its circuit it passes through a series of "phases" like the moon, from crescent to full and back again. And just as the moon passes through these phases, so Venus goes through similar changes, though on a much longer time scale.

Venus Most Prominent
Venus, the only planet now visible in the evening, is a brilliant object in the sky and will soon be joined by the Leonids, "shooting stars." 

By JAMES STOKEY

When the sun sets in the southwest, night by night these evenings as darkness falls, a bright point of light begins to stand out more and more prominently in the southwest sky. This is the planet Venus, now rapidly approaching its greatest brilliance for the year.

What is this Venus we see so prominently in the evening sky? What is its significance, and what is the nature of the phenomena associated with it at this season?

Venus, as all of us know, is one of the major planets of our solar system, the one nearest the Earth. Like the other planets, it revolves around the sun, but its orbit is closer to the sun than is the Earth's. This means that as Venus makes its circuit it passes through a series of "phases" like the moon, from crescent to full and back again. And just as the moon passes through these phases, so Venus goes through similar changes, though on a much longer time scale.

Venus is at its brightest and most prominent as an evening star when it is shining as a "half-moon" phase. This occurs when the body of Venus comes between the Earth and sun, but only a portion of the lighted side is turned toward us.

This is the condition of Venus at the present time. It is an old astronomical fact that the planet Venus, when in this half-moon phase, shines with the maximum brilliance possible for this body. And that is the reason why Venus is now so very prominent in the southwest evening sky.

Its brilliance is accentuated by the fact that on the evenings leading up to the 15th of this month the crescent of Venus grows narrower and more pointed, and the amount of illuminated surface turned toward the earth increases, reaching a maximum on about the 15th. After that date, Venus will recede in its orbit and the illuminated portion will gradually diminish until it passes through inferior conjunction and then reappears as the morning star.

Just how brilliant is Venus at this time? It is the brightest object in the sky, other than the sun and moon. In fact, the planet is so brilliant that it can often be seen in broad daylight, if one knows where to look for it. This was dramatically illustrated in the case of an observer who saw Venus about six weeks ago, on Oct. 9, just after sunset. That was the time of Venus' last "inferior conjunction," when it passed directly between the earth and sun.  At that time, Venus was so close to the sun that it was actually superimposed on the sun's disk, a phenomenon that is rarely observed. But the observer noticed Venus as a dark spot on the sun's face, proving that the planet was bright enough to be seen even in the full glare of the sun!

Orders Season's Finest

This is Venus, our brightest planet, the one destined to shine with unmatched splendor in our evening skies for the next several months. It will continue to grow brighter in the coming weeks, reaching its greatest brilliance in the early evening of Dec. 4, when it will be the striking object that dominates the southwest sky just after sundown. 

Then, too, will come the annual display of the Leonid meteor shower, popularly called the "shooting stars." These tiny particles of matter, burned up high in the earth's atmosphere, are the debris of Comet Tempel-Tuttle, which swings around the sun in a 33-year cycle. The Leonid shower reaches its peak on or about Nov. 17 each year, and the glowing Venus, sparkling in the southwest, will serve as a brilliant companion to the many "shooting stars" that will streak across the sky.

Brighter Stars in the Sky

There are many interesting features that can be observed in the evening sky at this season. High in the south you can see the four stars that form the "Great Square" part of the constellation Pegasus. To the east you will notice the bright stars Altair, Deneb and Vega, forming the famous Summer Triangle.

And if you look closely on clear evenings, you may even be able to catch a glimpse of the Andromeda galaxy, a great island universe of stars so distant that its light has been traveling for over a million years before reaching our eyes.

I SAW A FLYING SAUCER

The following is in answer to your request for any information concerning any UFO sightings in your area. I would like to report that on November 26, 1957, at approximately 6:15 p.m. (CST) near the Allison Engineering plant in Indianapolis, Indiana, I and two other employees of the Allison Engineering plant were driving home from work when we observed what appeared to be a flying saucer.

The object was first sighted slightly to the south of us and appeared to be stationary. It was clear but a few minutes elapsed when we observed it moving in a northerly direction, gaining speed as it went. The object was a silver-gray color and appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. It moved in a straight line and seemed to wobble slightly as it gained speed. The entire episode lasted less than a minute. 

As the object gained speed, it seemed to move away from us. When it was approximately a mile away, it seemed to accelerate in speed tremendously and faded from view. The entire sighting lasted approximately 45 seconds to a minute.

I would appreciate any information your office can provide on this incident as I am very interested in this type of phenomenon. All are other personnel who witnessed this sighting concur with my description of the object. I realize you probably receive many reports of this nature, but I felt it was my duty to report this incident to your office.

Here is the text from the document:

MATTO T. MEARES, RESIDENT
907 SOUTH VALMONT STREET
DEL RIO, TEXAS
November 6, 1957

Dear Sirs:

I am writing to report an observation of an unidentified flying object which I and several other persons observed in the vicinity of Del Rio, Texas, on the night of November 5, 1957, at 10:30 p.m.

The object was first sighted by Mrs. Meares as she was looking out of a window in our home. She called my attention to it, and I immediately went outside to observe it. The object was hovering in the sky, about 2,000 feet in altitude, and was approximately 75 feet in diameter. It appeared to be a large, lighted, disc-shaped object. The object then made a sharp turn toward the south, then back north and remained in the same general area for several minutes. The object then proceeded to move rapidly upward and out of sight.

In addition to Mrs. Meares and myself, the following persons also observed the object: Mrs. Bertha Wisehart, and Mr. Everett Wisehart, Mr. and Mrs. C.B. Wisehart, and their three children. All five persons who observed the object are local residents and are known to me to be reliable and reputable citizens.

I am submitting this report to you as I feel that the object was definitely not an airplane, satellite, or any known conventional aircraft. I would appreciate any information you may be able to provide regarding this observation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely yours,
MATTO T. MEARES
