The image contains two photographs. The larger one shows a circular diagram with compass directions, while the smaller one on the right shows a distant landscape with a person in the foreground.

AFR 80-17(C1)

Now imagine you are at the center of the compass rose. Place an X at the position on the compass to indicate the direction to the phenomenon when last seen. Place a 1 at any of the compass positions to indicate the direction to where the phenomenon was first seen. Place a 2 at any of the compass positions to indicate the direction the phenomenon was moving.

In the sketch below, place an X at the position of the phenomenon when first seen, and a 1 at the position of the phenomenon when last seen. If the path was straight, draw a straight line. If the path was curved or zig-zag, refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
