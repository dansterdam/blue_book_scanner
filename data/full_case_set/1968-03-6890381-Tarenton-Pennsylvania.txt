March 11, 1968

26 R.O. investigators Cente
Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base
Dayton, Ohio

Gentlemen:

I am 47 years old & am sending you a sighting of a U.F.O. which I have
just encountered at about 7:30 P.M. May 10, 1968
about 4 miles north of Syracuse
Ohio.

As I was traveling on Highway 33, I sighted an unusual object in the
sky. It appeared to be circular in shape & seemed to be approximately
40-50 feet in diameter. The object was hovering or drifting at an
altitude of 500-600 feet. It had multi-colored lights flashing on & off
in various patterns & the object was illuminated from within. I watched
the object for approximately 3-5 minutes & noticed that as I got closer,
the object began to increase its altitude & speed. I decided it would be
best to stop & observe the object rather than to continue driving. As I
stopped my car, the object accelerated at a very high rate of speed &
disappeared from sight. I am certain the object was not an aircraft,
satellite, or any other known object that I am familiar with.

I hope this information will be of some value to your investigation. If
you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Here is the text from the document:

"About, 9:10 a small missile shaped craft about 100 ft length shapped like a space ship with a tail, no light. Coming along the horizon. so fast 20 minutes later disappered. It stoped, hovered, then went down at a steep angle and vanished. it was dark so could not details well see within the next 15 min. I had never seen anything like this, within its speed and sudden disappearing act , startling its near silence and the manner of its flight. It traveled out of sight smoothly and swiftly."
