- page 14 -

The image provided does not contain any photographs, but rather a document with a detailed graph or chart. The chart appears to be part of a report or file related to Project Blue Book, which was a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) between 1952 and 1969.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text present in the document, the output is as follows:

EXPLANATION
The object reported on this date and over this area does not constitute an unidentified flying object. The object observed was a weather balloon launched from the Detroit-Selfridge AFB on the same date for upper-air sounding purposes. The balloon was tracked on radar from Detroit control tower and its position corresponded exactly with that reported by the observer. The object was visible to ground observers in clear skies and its motion and altitude were consistent with the properties of a weather balloon. This sighting is, therefore, explained as a weather balloon.

The image appears to be a graph or chart with a temperature scale on the left side and grid lines covering the majority of the image. There are no obvious human faces or identifiable individuals present in this image.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a memo or document text discussing photographs that were taken of an object described as a "small street light located across the street in the direction of the UFO". The memo indicates that the object was photographed but the street light was not.

MEMO FOR THE RECORD:

Spoke with Major Nylus concerning the photographs taken by the witness. Major Nylus said that he had the opportunity to view the photographs and the only object that appeared on the photographs was a small street light located across the street in the direction of the UFO. Major Nylus said he went to the scene and did see the street light, but the object was not photographed but the street light was.

2. LOCATION: Grosse Point Woods, Michigan

4. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: Several minutes
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground visual
7. COURSE: Slowly to the NE
8. PHOTOS: Yes
9. X PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: Yes
10. CONCLUSION: Balloon(hot air)
11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers watched a reddish orange colored light in the NE portion of the sky. The object was silent and gave off a funny sound. At first the observers thought the object was a jet, but when the object maintained a constant position, they concluded it must be a hot air balloon. The description is consistent with that of a hot air balloon. There has been a rash of hot air balloon reports from the area.
