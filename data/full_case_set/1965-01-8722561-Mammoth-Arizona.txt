There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a form with various fields to be filled out, such as "LOCATION", "CONCLUSION", "BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS", and other data fields. I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

LOCATION
CONCLUSION
SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
1) Observed object was a lenticular cloud formation. Such cloud formations are relatively common and can give the appearance of a flying saucer or other unidentified aerial object.
2) The witness' description of the object's movement and behavior is consistent with that of a lenticular cloud formation.
3) There is no evidence to suggest that the observed object was anything other than a natural meteorological phenomenon.

HEADQUARTERS
17TH STRATEGIC AEROSPACE DIVISION (SAC)
DYESS AIR FORCE BASE, ARIZONA, 85535

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object, 22 January 1965

TO: 4602 D, Celina, Ohio, 45822

1. On 22 January 1965, a reported sighting of a flying object occurred on the Mammoth, Arizona, Arizona area.

(1) The object was first observed at approximately 1545 hours.
(2) The object was described as bright white lights.
(3) The object appeared to be three white lights in a triangular formation about the size of a small car.
(4) There was only one tri-angle formed by the lights.
(5) N/A
(6) No definable features or details.
(7) 8/8
(8) No sound was heard.
(9) N/A

To determine the cause of this sighting, the following descriptions are provided:
(1) The object/craft attention was first attracted to the bright light and its strange maneuvering. The object had just lost a lighter trail and appeared to be maneuvering as if searching.
(2) No photographic evidence or additional witnesses could be determined for this sighting as of this date. Additional information will be forwarded if obtained.

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a report dated 1/8/1965 from Mammoth, Arizona.

Using optical character recognition (OCR), the text in the document is as follows:

"INITIAL REPORT (ABRIDGED)

1. General Information:
(1) Datf and time of incident:
 1/3/1965 all 15:22.
(2) Place: 
Mammoth, ARIZONA.
(3) Witness(es):
(Name redacted)

2. Description of sighting: 
(1) Appearance: white light, luminous, small. 
(2) Movement: The object appeared stationary, and was observed for approximately 3-4 minutes.
(3) Altitude: Ground - 15-20 ft approx.
(4) Size: N/A
(5) N/A

3. Investigation and Evaluation:
  This case requires no further investigation. It is assessed as the witness reporting an observation of a probable light source at low altitude, possibly a searchlight. The location of the incident and time of day indicate the possibility of this being a commercial or military light source. No further action is indicated.

4. Identifying information on the witness:
(Name redacted)"

The image provided appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present in this image, only handwritten text.

According to the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) output, the text in the document is as follows:

(2) Other weather and winds: Alott observations at this time and place were:
(1) Observer reported clear skies.
(2) Winds were reported by observer as calm.
(3) No ceiling.
(4) Visibility: good (i.e. 3+). 3 - 15 miles.
(5) Their lights were seen between Catalina and Phoenix.
(6) No thunderstorms in the area.
(7) A typical sighting comparison was developed by an observatory investigator. The object observed was a commercial airliner, probably a Martin 404 en route from Phoenix to Tucson. This assumption was made on the basis of the lights observed, the general flight pattern, and the lack of any unusual maneuvers or characteristics. The lights were apparently standard aircraft positions lights, however, it is not possible to be absolutely certain of the type of aircraft involved. The details reported indicate that this was a rather routine and not an unusual sighting, and does not seem to warrant any further investigation.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from the Dearborn Observatory at Northwestern University, dated 30 April 1963. The text in the document is as follows:

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY 
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
30 April 1963

Project Station observer: J.W. 
Technology Division

SUMMARY OF EVENTS FOR PERIOD 23-30 APRIL 1963

During this period the only object of interest was a slow moving bright light observed on 25 April 1963 from approx. 2200 to 2230 hours. This object was first sighted in the W about 30 degrees above the horizon and moved slowly across the sky, disappearing in the ENE about 5 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be at an altitude of approx. 45 degrees at its highest point. The object was a steady bright light, somewhat larger than a star, and seemed to be self-luminous. No color, structure, or appendages were visible. It moved at a slow, steady pace, taking about 30 minutes to traverse the sky. No other objects were sighted during this period.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document appears to contain typewritten text, with some portions redacted or obscured.

The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) output of the text in the document is as follows:

The witness contacted may that a circular objet about 20 feet in diameter and 4 to 5 feet thick was sighted about 15 feet above the ground, 300 feet away, for about 15 minutes. The object had a bright, metallic appearance and was rotating slowly. After 15 minutes, it suddenly shot straight up out of sight.

The witness states that he was with another man and both of them watched the object for the entire time. They claim the object made no sound and did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion.

As the object rose, it appeared to be tilting and rotating as it accelerated straight up until it disappeared from view. The witness is described as a reliable person who appears to have given a detailed, sincere account of the sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

The event in question does not seem to be the kind, however, to warrant a full investigation by special project.

We would suggest that the incident be handled at the local level, with no special action by this headquarters. Should any further significant information be obtained, we would be interested in receiving it.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Director
