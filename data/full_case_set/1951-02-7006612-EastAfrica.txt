FOREIGN SERVICE DISPATCH
FROM: US EMBASSY
TO: DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON
REF: 710.2
SUBJECT: APPEARANCE OF AN ALLEGED "FLYING SAUCER" OVER KILIMANJARO, TANGANYIKA

The Consulate reports the alleged appearance of the first "flying saucer" to be observed in East Africa which is located next to Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanganyika. The observers reportedly saw a silver disc-shaped object hovering over the Mount Kilimanjaro area. When it started to move, it accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.

Details given by the crew and passengers describe the object as circular, about 50 feet in diameter, and traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. It was seen by several of the passengers, and they declared to have thrown objects at it in an effort to evaluate its composition. As soon as the "flying saucer" was observed, contact was made with the French Consulate in an effort to corroborate the sighting.

The saucer was seen for about 17 minutes by both the crew and passengers of the KLM aircraft which is bound for Nairobi, Kenya. The aircraft was cruising at an altitude of about 10,000 feet when the saucer was sighted. The operator is reported to have taken a picture of the object through the window, but no information concerning that photograph has been received thus far.

To make certain that there was no mistake concerning the evidence of this plane, it is reported that the incident was later discussed by the passengers and crew, and they affirmed that they had all seen the same object. It is reported that the object tilted at a 45 degree angle and then disappeared at a high rate of speed.

In view of the alleged occurrence of various "flying saucers", the Embassy would appreciate receiving any comments or additional information the Department may have concerning this incident.

FEBRUARY 10, 1951, Claimed by Capt. West African Air Force Cpl. Woodward, and several other civilians, at Kano, West Africa about 9:00 p.m. Local Time.

Captain Westlower, of the West African Air Force, and Cpl. Woodward were on duty at the airport at Kano, West Africa, on the evening of February 10, 1951. Captain Westlower had just relieved another officer who had been on duty, and was going to stay at the airport until 7 p.m. normally. However, as they were working, an object was sighted in the sky at about 9:00 p.m.

At first it appeared to be a star, but it soon became apparent that it was moving rapidly, and was heading in their direction from the northeast. As it approached them it slowed down and appeared to hover directly over the airport at a height estimated to be about 500 feet. It was observed for about 10 minutes or more.

During the time it was under observation, the object remained stationary, except for slight irregular movements, and a faint reddish glow was observed around its outer edges. No sound was heard from the object. Several other civilians, who were on duty at the airport, also observed the object. To all of them it appeared to be circular in shape, and about 30 to 40 feet in diameter.

Captain Westlower estimated the thing was over 300 miles per hour when first sighted, but slowed down to a complete hover over the airport. He stated that his impression was that the object was under intelligent control. He said it was easily observed, and that there was no doubt as to what they had seen. The object finally shot away to the northeast at a terrific speed.

Reported that if the object was a flying machine it was not going above 500 yards altitude but maintaining an altitude of something like 200 yards. The object was described as cigar-shaped with very bright lights at either end which appeared to be two separate objects but were still connected. The object was seen on Sunday and Monday for several hours each day. On Monday morning it was seen to appear to be rotating as it lay stationary in the sky. The object was yellowish in color and had definite extremities which appeared to be distinct sections. The object remained stationary and still in the sky for long periods and observers were convinced that this object was not an aircraft. The object finally disappeared in the distance and observers were unable to determine how or when it left. Apparently nothing definite was concluded regarding its nature or identity.

The image appears to contain a scanned document from Project Blue Book, describing an outstanding sighting that occurred on February 19, 1951 at Nairobi, Kenya, East Africa. The document does not contain any photographs, but provides a detailed description of the sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

AN OUTSTANDING SIGHTING
THE MT. KILIMANJARO SIGHTING
February 19, 1951, dawned bright and clear at Nairobi, Kenya, Colony, East Africa. 
At Nairobi West Airport, the regular Monday morning Lodestar was readied to take off for its morning flight to Dar es Salaam, and soon passengers filed aboard, little dreaming of what was to mark their return by the unusual events barely 20 minutes later.
At 7 a.m. exactly with 9 passengers and a crew of 2 aboard, the Lodestar took off. 
All went well until 7.20 a.m. when suddenly the radio officer drew the attention of his superior, Capt. J. Bicknell, to a bright object like a white, apparently circular, motionless vessel some 10,000 ft. above Mt. Kilimanjaro.
Capt. Bicknell's first reaction, he said later, was to say nothing. The thing was watched intently, however, because of its curious behavior of gliding silently through the air, apparently studying the locality, whilst the radio officer listened on the interphone, and prompted by a powerful pair of binoculars which the Captain was using, gave an excited call to Eastleigh nearby, giving an account and description of the thing.
Eastleigh's suggestion it seemed in reply was that the object might be a U.S. Air Force pilot testing new equipment. But checking on that, revealed nothing the Lodestar Captain had to examine that peculiarity. For when Capt. Bicknell found that he was observing it, the thing had already started to climb swiftly and sail away in the direction of Mt. Kilimanjaro, and disappeared at an apparently tremendous speed. The whole sighting lasted perhaps 17 minutes.
Capt. Bicknell estimated the thing was over 200 ft. long, bullet-shaped, and apparently constructed of metal which shone brightly. On first sighting, it seemed only a few miles distant, but afterwards it appeared to be incredibly distant, was its speed or manner of doing so that caused this impression.
There were no signs of movement, no sound, no exhaust, nothing. The thing possessed a square-cut vertical fin at one end. There were no signs of movement: it was absolutely stationary.
So it remained for 17 minutes. Passengers of the Lodestar were now taking turns with the field-glasses, and it had soon become the main topic of conversation.

FLYING SAUCERS:
The page describes observations of flying saucer-like objects that were seen slowly moving eastwards. The objects were first observed at a distance of about 6,000 ft, and appeared to be maneuvering without any visible means of propulsion. The passage notes that the objects were seen clearly for about 3 minutes, covering a distance of about 60 miles. It mentions that the objects were "bell-shaped" and seemed to have a "sort of a halo" around them. The passage also discusses the possible explanations and theories that were considered regarding the nature of these objects.

FLYING SAUCERS.

When taking photographs, the first thing began to move slowly eastwards, rising at first, and rising as it did so. Before it reached 6,000 ft, white it had a sort of a halo around it. It had a bell-shape looking object was such clearly to the sides of the "window"; whale-like objt wre seen quite clearly through a binocular, with a curious appearance slightly restoring.

The day being exceptionally clear, there were no cloud formations to mask the strange thing. As she watched for the 3 minutes of its visible movement, the bell-shaped object covered 60 miles; that is, it traveled at a speed of over 1,000 m.p.h. during the period of observed flight. It appeared to be nothing lust nothing as vapor trails and no visible means of propulsion.

During an interview some days later, Capt. Bicknell said that his impression was that the unidentified thing was some kind of flying machine, and with this belief he and the local villagers unanimously agreed, unhesitatingly agreed. "It was suggested as the possible mirage", was discussed as "mirage" are rarely seen without cloud", he stated, "nor would that explain the object's movements which were those of a flying machine. "It was 500 yards ahead of anything we have today".

Major Keyhoe finally said: "If this report had come from a few isolated individuals it would soon be dismissed, but it came from nine ordinary travelers". It too, dismissed both the balloon and mirage" theories, and concluded that this "natural" experience had begun to fade. Other theories ranged from Martian visitors to the sun-controlled hallucinations.

Fragmentary evidence accrued since then increases the sum total of knowledge about this little-known phenomenon. U.S. "Flying Magazine" early in 1952, published a sketch of the object, which showed it to closely resemble a "submarine-like" outline with a defined top and fins recently, in connection with learning the whereabouts of the photographs taken in East Africa, the authorities Flying Saucer Bureau learned that "the only known public photograph of the object" shows a "disc-shaped mass on the film". A relation pic shows the object with light emanating from underneath, or possibly, symmetrically. It is hard to tell which, that the man with the film is supposed to have disappeared.

So the case stands, at present, one of the most puzzling and enigmatic unexplained Saucer Sightings recorded in Australian Flying Saucer Files.
