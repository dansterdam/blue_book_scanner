RECORD OF INVESTIGATION
1. SUBJECT - (C) - Unidentified Flying Object Observed at Edwards AFB, California.

2. LOCATION - Edwards Air Force Base, California

3. DATE - 6 May 1957

4. TIME - 1345 hours (1:45 p.m.) Pacific Standard Time

5. WITNESSES - (C) - Lt. Col. Walter G. Winstead, USAF, Pilot, 4750th Test Squadron

6. DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING - (C) - Lt. Col. Winstead reported that while flying at an altitude of approximately 7,500 feet in an F-84F aircraft, he observed a small bright light in the sky at a position estimated to be about 3 miles northwest of his aircraft. The light was first observed at an elevation angle of approximately 40 degrees above the horizon. As the light moved rapidly in a straight line, the elevation angle increased to about 70 degrees above the horizon. The light then appeared to go out. The total duration of the sighting was approximately 10 seconds. Lt. Col. Winstead stated that the light did not blink or flicker, and that it appeared to move at a speed far in excess of any conventional aircraft. (C)

7. CONCLUSION - (C) - The identity of the object observed by Lt. Col. Winstead has not been determined. There were no other witnesses to the sighting, and no physical evidence or material was recovered. However, the rapid straight-line movement and high speed of the object as described by the witness are not characteristic of any known conventional aircraft or other identifiable aerial phenomena.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object, Edwards AFB, California

1. At approximately 1750 hours on 6 May 1957, Major XXXXX, USAF, and Captain XXXXX, USAF, were conducting a chase practice mission in F-86D jet aircraft over the Edwards AFB area.

2. While flying at an altitude of approximately 40,000 feet, Major XXXXX and Captain XXXXX observed an unidentified object in the sky. The object was described as being silvery in color, elliptical in shape, and much larger than the chase aircraft. The object was moving at a high rate of speed and appeared to be at a much higher altitude than the chase aircraft.

3. Attempts were made to close in on the object, but it quickly accelerated and disappeared from view. No other aircraft were observed in the vicinity at the time.

4. The sighting was reported to the 831st AC&W Squadron at Edwards AFB. The object was not picked up on radar.

5. This report is submitted for your information and evaluation.

THIS NARRATIVE REPORT CONCERNS OBSERVATIONS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS MADE BY PERSONNEL OF THE 4750TH PILOT TRAINING WING, EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA, ON 6 MAY 1957.

ON THE EVENING OF 6 MAY 1957, NUMEROUS PERSONNEL OF THE 4750TH PILOT TRAINING WING OBSERVED UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENA IN THE VICINITY OF EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA.

AT APPROXIMATELY 2030 HOURS, A NUMBER OF AIRMEN STATIONED AT THE BASE WERE OBSERVING THE NIGHT SKY NEAR THE NORTHWEST BOUNDARY OF THE INSTALLATION. SUDDENLY, SEVERAL BRILLIANT LIGHTS APPEARED IN THE AIR APPROXIMATELY TWO MILES NORTHWEST OF THEIR LOCATION. INITIAL OBSERVATIONS INDICATED THE OBJECTS WERE MOVING AT HIGH ALTITUDES AND HIGH RATES OF SPEED.

PERSONNEL MANNING A CONTROL TOWER ALSO OBSERVED THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS AND NOTIFIED THE BASE OPERATIONS OFFICER, WHO IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED AN F-86D AIRCRAFT TO INVESTIGATE. THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO VISUALLY ACQUIRE OR ESTABLISH RADAR CONTACT WITH THE OBJECTS, WHICH CONTINUED TO MANEUVER IN THE SKY AT VERY HIGH SPEEDS.

AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES, THE BRILLIANT LIGHTS APPEARED TO ACCELERATE AND VANISH FROM SIGHT. NUMEROUS PERSONNEL CONTINUED OBSERVING THE SKY FOR SOME TIME, BUT NO FURTHER ACTIVITY WAS DETECTED.

LATER THAT EVENING, SEVERAL OTHER ISOLATED SIGHTINGS OF SIMILAR UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA WERE REPORTED BY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES ON BASE. HOWEVER, NO FURTHER INVESTIGATIVE ATTEMPTS WERE MADE.

THE INCIDENTS DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT WERE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED BY OFFICERS OF THE 4750TH PILOT TRAINING WING AND REPORTED TO HIGHER HEADQUARTERS. NO CONCLUSIONS COULD BE DRAWN AS TO THE NATURE OR ORIGIN OF THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS.
