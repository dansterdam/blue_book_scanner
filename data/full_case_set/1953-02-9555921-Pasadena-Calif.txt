The image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and instructs the reader to place an "A" on the line to indicate where a high object was observed above the horizon, and a "B" on the same line to indicate where the object was observed later. The second sketch is a larger drawing that shows a road or path with trees on the sides, and two smaller sketches - one of a person standing on the road, and another of a sky with an object at the position marked as "A" and "B" in the first sketch.

Text extracted from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may report information that you have already given in the statements, and add any further comments, statements, or sketches that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they are needed.

NAME: [REDACTED]

DATE: 9 April 1953

These three bright, round, white objects came over faster than a jet, then stopped, hovered, and moved away again with darting and swooping motions. Startled and excited, I reported this to an officer. He said it was probably aircraft from Edwards. I asked him why the objects moved and stopped so erratically if they were aircraft. He had no further explanation, but he did not seem much interested. I should have reported this incident earlier when it occurred, but I was not sure at the time just what I had seen. However, the incident has remained in my mind, and I now feel it should be recorded. The objects were about 46 feet in diameter and appeared to be about 3 to 5 miles away. Their motions and speeds were vastly different from any aircraft I have ever seen.

The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a typed document or report with text describing some observations or information related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text extracted from the document:

Movement showed evidence of being traveling with air or weather mass.
Weather that day and day following showed a large area of disturbance....
Reason for reporting this: There is a war, weather and much discussion of GERM wars and such associations, the study evidently has content-
plation of this method of destruction.
There is also wide knowledge of the Japanese effort with balloons.
Therefore this small group of information.

Wind light. At first might was confused for star, then
may - be star, finally noticed it was seemingly
stationary. This change indicates later noticed
that it had moved very little if at all.
Then for a while it appeared to have a point on house with
twin lights (star-ward) after dark concluded it was
moving. Its diameter about 5 to 7 miles per hr.
This object at first seem to be very bright
object second may-be, about sunset it seemed to
get larger,brightness increased if anything.
Thought no point to determine definitely because
disappeared, when faded to rarity until it nearly
disappeared, when again reappeared in different place
with-out doubt.Have a point that could be used
to triangulate on.
/signed/
Further: Ballons or corp. flangen
Have picked up numerous remains of this equipment

Planned all investigations, several flights over details.
Conclusion: This object to large for weather
Balloon. No known aircraft this time
