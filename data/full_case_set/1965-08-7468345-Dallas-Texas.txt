- page 5 -

The image contains a diagram and instructions related to reporting UFO sightings. The diagram shows a curved line labeled "horizon (skyline)" and a compass rose. The instructions ask the observer to draw a picture of the motion of the object or objects seen, and if there was more than one object, to draw a picture of how they were arranged and indicate the direction they were traveling.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "C" on the compass where the object first appeared, and a "D" on the compass where the object last appeared.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, and a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

ADDRESS Street City Zone State
TELEPHONE NUMBER AGE SEX
Indicate any additional information about your case, including any special experiences, which might be pertinent.
33. When and to whom did you report that you had seen the object?

The image does not contain a photograph, it shows a page from an old UFO report document. I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire:      6      Day       1265    Month      Year

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

This sounds like a probable case - the lights were observed by several witnesses and the object reportedly moved across the sky in a peculiar manner. It was brightly lit, making observation easy, and the witness seems rational and impartial in their description. There was no physical evidence like burn marks, but the sighting was of relatively short duration. All in all, it seems like a reasonably well-documented and interesting UFO case, though without any conclusive proof or identification.

Thank you for your report. I hope this case will prove useful for further analysis and investigation.

I hope the OCR output is helpful. Please let me know if you need anything else.

part of it the rest remains skeptical. and they refuse to indentify
my case which I believe case as a minor and harmless and they
refuse to investigate it, it.

I have assured many things in the way in the past eight

i saw it clear every time at first it seemed

i could see it was not a plane or any other

DALLAS, TEXAS
4 AUGUST 1955

Observer was out looking for unidentified flying objects when at approximately 2215 hours a dim red object appeared moving due south, straight overhead. The light crossed half of the sky in ten to fifteen seconds. The light, about the size of a bright star, was moving faster than any aircraft the observer had ever observed. The object just disappeared. There was no sound or trail noted. The object wasn't bright enough to be seen clearly.

COMMENTS:
The presented data is characteristic of a meteor, however, no trail or tail was reported. As for being a satellite, balloon or aircraft, the duration and degree of arc through which the object passed discounts such an explanation. Observer has reported two other sightings to the Air Force. As such, with the information available, the case is considered as unidentified by the Air Force.
