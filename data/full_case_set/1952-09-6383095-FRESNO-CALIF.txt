30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important. Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

We are very familiar with flying devices and are much interested in this matter. I am also familiar with flying discs. Do not believe in this way as other people are so positive, we have little traffic of any kind of people from some other planets, and if so, what could they do for us? Have ideas as a matter of human welfare are very dubious and it is wise to be reserved from human feeling than to become excited over unidentified phenomena. Rational things would seem well for the object appears more mystically to human beings and might give rise to superstition and abnormal psychology. The objects observed were dim and first and then bright and distinct, and seemed to travel at a varying speed, sometimes slow and sometimes fast, and seemed to maneuver in a manner difficult to describe or reconcile with any known aircraft. What was seen did not appear to be any kind of standard aircraft and gave the impression of something unnatural. The objects appeared to fade from view and then reappear, but I was not close enough to obtain any detailed observation of their construction or method of propulsion."

Aerial Intelligence
March Air Force, California

1. Description of Object: The (1) or two (2) relatively short confirmations, or
trails of burning material, apparently hovering from a limited stationary and rising again at intervals, were observed on 7 September 1952, from about 2030 to 2130 hours PWT, by five or six persons near Fresno, California. The object or objects, at times completely stationary, moved slowly or not at all, and no trail was apparent during stationary phases. The object at times could not be seen distinctly and the trails appearing to extend out from it seemed to be nearly circular in shape. The color was a dull reddish-yellow at first, but becoming reddish-later.

a. 'Also, but shining, yellow at first, but becoming reddish-later.'
b. 'The brilliance or a brilliantly lighted half moon.'
c. 'Pronounced, or rotates, like the sun when you look at it at sunset.'
d. 'Not so mysterious but sort of light brown.'

Objects (or object) was in sight for approximately 1 hour. It was first observed at approximately 2030 hours and last seen at approximately 2130 hours. The 2 (two) objects were at times observed separately but were at others simultaneously. More than once an object (or objects) would seem to divide into two or more parts. At other times two objects came together, approached each other, and then appeared to fuse into a single object. The speed of movement was difficult to estimate but appeared to be relatively slow, sometimes appearing to be stationary, at others moving approximately 10 to 15 degrees per minute. No sound was reported. The object or objects appeared to be at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet.

2. Data: The most detailed account of this observation covered the period of
2008 hours to 2130 hours (approximately 1 hour and 12 minutes), 1952, and was reported as follows:

All of the observers at the observation point were reportedly normal and healthy individuals of the 'Fresno Weather Bureau' who had tracked objects with their instruments. However, from their observations, it was determined that no tracks or trails were recorded on their instruments. The visual observations did observe trails, but only visually. And from his residence during observation period, the base commander of the nearby Air Force base could not observe anything unusual in the sky."

b. Reliability of Information:
Californian: This man had no previous record of sighting unidentified aerial objects, however, his interest in this particular incident was obviously more than casual. His reliability is therefore considered as good, according to the rules for classification of witnesses established for the UFO investigations. This indicates the probability of visitors from outer world.

"The principal information obtained together represents a former USAF pilot, employed as a retired-secretary. However, quite stable and intelligent, and discussed his observation in a normal, consistent manner. All reported details related to make observation possible."

6. Weather: Clear sky--winds light and variable, of less than 5-15 velocity (as reported by Castle AF Base weather service).

7. Related Activities or Conditions: None determined.

8. Physical Evidence: None.

9. Intention or Identification Action: None determined. 

10. Local Air Traffic: Aeronautical facilities in the Fresno area were checked to determine possibility of any aircraft in the area at this particular time, but negative results were obtained. No local records were available to indicate what, if any, other significant air traffic may have been flying in the Fresno area at this time.

IR-150-52
9 Sep. 5, 1952, 3:40 A.M.

Air, was there an unidentified or known aerial object over the area south of Fresno and northeast of Coalinga? Yes, there was.

At about 7:05 a.m. (or 4 hrs if we westward (a little watch of west?), an object which seemed to be slowly descending from "centers" appeared. It appeared to be round, nearly the same brightness as the surrounding sky, and was estimated to be about 15 degrees in diameter. It could not be identified as a star, planet, balloon, or any conventional aircraft. It was in this position for about 10 minutes.

Incidentally the object appeared to be at least 50 degrees above the horizon. The reporting witness stated that the object turned northward, increased in brightness, and at about 7:20 a.m. disappeared in a little less than a minute. This unusually rapid disappearance led the witness to assume the object must have accelerated to an extremely high speed.

The object was not seen by another witness, but it was seen and described by two other individuals who live about 7.5 miles from the scene. Their description agrees closely with the report received. The object seemed to become a little larger and brighter as it disappeared.

So, my analysis, don't 5 eye olds, also observed that the object seemed to go "too slow for a jet" and the trail wasn't there as they watch.

No sound was heard (here).

I thought that newsworthy (from Fresno's KMJ or KST?) this morning might report to public this incident, but there were no reports to my knowledge.

The text on the page is as follows:

News Article Appearing in Fresno Bee 9 September 1952

JETS "TRAILER" IS BLAMED FOR "BALL OF FIRE"

Great balls of fire!

This is what many San Joaquin Valley residents swear they saw and northwest sky last evening.

In Hanford many people are reported to be to police Lieutenants to have told of a brilliant California Highway patrolman who followed it. He said it appeared to be moving northward and eventually disappeared.

To some it appeared elliptical, later shortening to nearly circular, but other reports said it looked like the still of a comet. 

Meteorologists of the Fresno Weather Bureau to whom it appeared to be an aircraft were puzzled. They said a red trail left behind and it was apparently at about 35,000 feet and moving at the estimated speed of 600 mph.

The thing had a pale, but shining, yellow color at first but became reddish later, and according to some reports, differed northwestward about 9:50 PM.

The vapor trail had the appearance of a brilliant, streamlined half-mile long bar-like form. Webb said he was standing near "Tulare" and Divisadero Streets where he viewed the sight. He said it appeared to be moving northward and eventually disappeared.
