NOTES AND CONDITIONS AROUND SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
WITNESSED IN LABRADOR AT CO-ORDINATES 62 23 N 65 45 W ON 6 NOVEMBER 1954.
OBJECT WAS FIRST SIGHTED AT APPROXIMATELY 4:30 P.M. MOVING SLOWLY FROM LEFT TO RIGHT CROSSING THE SKY APPROXIMATELY 45-60 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON.
OBJECT APPEARED TO BE FLAT WHITE OR SILVER IN COLOR, ELLIPTICAL IN SHAPE AND APPROXIMATELY 25-30 FEET IN DIAMETER. NO TRAILS, VAPORS OR SOUNDS WERE OBSERVED.
OBJECT MAINTAINED ITS COURSE AND SPEED THROUGHOUT SIGHTING. IT THEN SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IN A SOUTH-EASTERLY DIRECTION TOWARD THE OCEAN. 
SIGHTING LASTED APPROXIMATELY 2-3 MINUTES.
IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE ANY DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE SIGHTING. BECAUSE OF THE UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR AND APPEARANCE OF THE OBJECT, IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT IN USE AT THAT TIME.
