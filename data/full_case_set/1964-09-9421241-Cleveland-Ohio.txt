Appendix 4E
(Airman, Civilian, CAA Personnel, ete)
This is to certify that I have seen an unidentified flying object which I cannot explain. The object was observed on 28 August 1964 at approximately 2115 hours in the sky over Cleveland, Ohio.
The object appeared to be a solid, brightly lighted, circular object. It was silent and traveled at a high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes before disappearing from view.
