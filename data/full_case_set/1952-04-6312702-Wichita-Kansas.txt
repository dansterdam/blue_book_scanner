SUBJECT: Wichita, Kansas
22 July 1952
Major John J. Donahue, Intelligence Officer
at the USOGS:

ON 22 APRIL 1952, a report was received of the sighting of two round luminous objects, approximately 30 feet in diameter, seen over Wichita, Kansas at approximately 12:15 am. The objects were observed to be maneuvering at a high rate of speed and then disappearing. Photographs were taken but they did not show the objects clearly. The observation was estimated to be 200 yards in altitude.

Intelligenc report:
DEFENSE FLYING SAUCER INVESTIGATION
WICHITA, KANSAS
APRIL 6, 1952

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
Color yellow - a little that of ordinary household candle. Speed and directions of movement showed an obvious control over craft. No visible signs of propulsion.

COURSE TAKEN BY OBJECT:
The object was approaching from a southerly direction and passed overhead of the observer moving in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed. It traveled a distance of approximately 15-20 miles in about 10 seconds, indicating a speed in excess of 5,000 mph. After reaching a point slightly north of the observer, the object made a sharp turn to the northeast and continued in that direction at the same extremely high speed, disappearing from sight in the distance.

DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVER:
The observer was seated in an automobile parked in an open field at the time of the observation. He was facing in a northerly direction. The observation was made in daylight and the sky was clear.

LOCATION OF OBSERVER:
About 5 miles southwest of Wichita, Kansas, in an open field.

TIME OF OBSERVATION:
The observation was made about 3:00 PM on the afternoon of April 6, 1952.

The image contains a photograph of a handwritten document titled "Report on a Flying Object Observed Twice April 15, 1952". The text in the document describes observations of a flying object, including details about its appearance, location, and movement.

REPORT ON A FLYING OBJECT OBSERVED TWICE APRIL 15, 1952

FIRST APPEARANCE
1. Time: About 10:45 PM but not before 10:42 PM and not after 10:52 PM.
2. Description of Object: Bright light, round in shape and appeared to be moving at a high velocity (moon visible in sky very dark).
3. Location of Object: In field of view of observer engaged in conversation - position of head normal - but to center the object an upward lift of head was necessary. Object viewed from sidewalk adjacent to that residence.
4. Position of Observer: Approx. 50 ft. south from north line of property.
5. Direction of Flight: SSE.

SECOND APPEARANCE
1. Time: Approx. one minute after first appearance.
2. Location of Object: In field of view of observer engaged in conversation - position of head normal. Again the object appeared to rise slightly to center the field of view, object appeared over residences located on west side of North Belmont.
3. Position of Observer: Approx. 100 ft. south of position of first appearance.
4. Appearances: Color yellow - like that of ordinary incandescent electric source. Electric source - clear and slightly dim sky and disappearing close, approx. 1500 ft. Light source did not "twinkle" like a star - did not seem to brighten or dim - steady. First impression of this observer was that of a round electric light source traveling at a very high rate of speed. This impression was concieved because of the "streak of light" appearance. This seems illogical, because this object appeared to be of a single light source with no limits. The "streak of lights" were parallel - not fanning out. The light appeared solid throughout - no gradual appearance and disappearance by an electric switch - no gradual appearance and disappearance - a very instantaneous flash of a very bright point of light source traveling a curved course at a very high rate of speed.
5. Observation: It is the opinion of this observer that the light source was of a conic outline comparable to that of a "long banana" slightly curved.

This page does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing a UFO sighting report.

The text in the document is as follows:

Page 2
The curved section being more pronounced in the first half of the "Trail", is due, in part, to the length of travel approximating 1500 ft. The upper and bottom lines are virtually parallel. No resemblance to exhaust from jet or combustion type engine - no appearance of flames - no discoloration. Impression of speed 200 to 300 miles per hour - impression of height, approximately 500 ft. Impression of distance approximately 1500 ft. No noise noted.

6. Observer: OBSERVER: Wichita, Kansas - Age 45 
President, Swallow Airplane Company - graduate Aeronautical Engineer - class 1935 - continious aircraft experience since graduation.

Note 1: The second appearance was noted simultaneously by Mrs. Bloomfield and myself.

Note 2: The Wichita Evening Eagle of April 16, 1952 reports as follows: "Mrs. --------, 1413 Forest Drive, saw a strangely lighted object in the heavens Tuesday night and she is wondering if any other Wichitans living in that area had seen any "flying saucers" reports. Mrs. ------- said the strange light was in the southwest, in a matter of seconds. "A vivid green in color, it had the appearance of a huge kite with a long tail, perhaps 150-200 ft. in length" The woman said her husband tried to take a picture for which she was fitted Tuesday, but she insists she didn't have then on at the time."

Note 3: In each of the two appearances I estimate the time the light was exposed at 1.5 seconds.
