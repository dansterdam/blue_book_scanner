The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a US Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings. The document is a letter discussing an unidentified aerial object (possibly a meteor) that was observed and reported in the Williamsburg, Virginia area in August 1959.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Washington, D.C.

Subject: Unidentified aerial object (meteor ?)  
Sirs:
Not knowing what Government agency is interested in  
reports and description of unusual aerial objects, I decided  
to write to you, thinking you would have some interest in  
such reports, or could advise me where to send them.

Last September (1959) I sighted by chance an object  
moving through the sky in the manner of a meteor. It was  
larger than most meteors, however, and was bright green.  
The local newspapers had reported a day or two before that  
several green objects had been sighted in the early evening  
and were thought to be meteors. The object that I sighted  
was seen in the middle of the night, and I read no reports  
of it. I wrote down as detailed data as I could, all angles,  
etc. being estimated since I had no instruments.

If you should be interested in the data that I put  
down, I will be glad to send it to you. It will never about  
one page, typewritten.

It was only recently that I decided it might be of  
some interest or value. If this subject is not of direct  
interest to your organization, I will appreciate it if you  
will send this letter to the proper agency.

Yours truly,
[Signature redacted]

Dear Mr. _______,

This is in further response to your letter of August 3, 1960, in which you report the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

We wish to thank you for your interest in submitting the description contained in your letter. As you may know, a number of similar observations have been reported for which there is no particularly satisfactory explanation. This office has facilities designed to investigate such occurrences. We have, therefore, forwarded your letter to the Air Force which has the primary responsibility for investigating this type of phenomenon.

Very truly yours,

James A. _________, Secretary

REPLY TO ATTN OF: AFOIN-REPC

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTINGS  

TO: SAFOI-3d (L/Col Anderson)

1. Attached are copies of letters which were forwarded to ATIC by the AMA and the MASA scientific flight objects. The information contained in these letters is not sufficient for a conclusion to be reached by ATIC; therefore, request ATIC Forms #14 be sent to the witnesses for their completion and forwarding directly to this center, ATTN: AFOIN-REPC.

2. Addresses of the witnesses are as follows:
WITNESS #1: [REDACTED]
Lanett, Alabama
WITNESS #2: [REDACTED] 
Williamsburg, Virginia

3. If the above witnesses know of any other witnesses to the sightings, request this information be included in their reports.

Dear Mr. ***,

Your letter of August 8, 1960, addressed to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was referred to this office.

The Air Force is assigned the responsibility for investigating all reports of unusual aerial objects over the U.S., including those that have been labeled unidentified flying objects.

TO insure adequate evaluation of these sightings it is necessary that complete information be included. Since the sighting made by you occurred in 1959 it would be most difficult, if not impossible, to render an evaluation that would lead to a conclusion. However, I am enclosing AFSC Form 14, for you to complete if you so desire. This form should be forwarded to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, ATTN: AFOIH-4ZZ2.

For your information, I am also enclosing a copy of the latest Department of Defense fact sheet, Air Force UFO Report.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Very truly yours,

WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.

Intelligence Hq. 4th Tac Ftr Wg. This object was sighted by Glenn E. Pilot, OPS HATCH FWG Lt. Gaffeney, John L. Pilot the HATCH FWG, Lt. Gen'l. Howard McCaw, 7 years experience 1943-1 AACS. Seymour Johnson AFB, NC. They all stated that the object was moving at a high rate of speed at the 30,000 foot level, and was approximately 3 times the size of a normal B-66 bomber. They were unable to estimate the direction of travel since the object varied from the size of a dime to that of a silver dollar during their observation. Their estimated airspeed was 15 or more times faster than a jet aircraft. The direction of travel is contrary to known man-made satellites.

V. C. 1. None - no radar pickup by AC & W Site at ___ Beach.
