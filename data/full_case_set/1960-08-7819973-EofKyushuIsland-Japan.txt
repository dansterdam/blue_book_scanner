UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: E. of Kyushu Island, Japan
Date: 11 August 1960
Time (Z): 11:32
WX: Clear
Description: Seen as a ball of light with a number of orange sparks following behind it. The object was observed to make a 90 degree turn in front of the observer and its estimated speed was several thousand M.P.H. The object disappeared within 4 to 5 seconds.
Discrete of Motion: None
Satellite: (AFCIN-4F3, Phone 69219) None reported to be reentering at this time.
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.): None
Radar Analysis (AFCIN-4E1): None
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): None
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: None
Other: 
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Prob reliable

Analysis and Conclusions: There seem to be no additional reports to be questioned in this case. The initial sighting appears to be an authentic observation of an unidentified object crossing the sky at extremely high speed. The observer's description of the object making a 90 degree turn and disappearing within 4 to 5 seconds suggests the possibility of a meteor passing through the atmosphere.
