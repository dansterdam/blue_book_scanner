Flying Something Seen Saturday
The Spartanburg journal dated 24 July 1950. (Afternoon Edition) Spartanburg, South Carolina.

Reporter S-es Flying 'Thing'
Vernon Smith, a Spartanburg journal reporter, today reports that on Saturday night a "cloud-like flying object, glowing a dull red in the night sky near the Star-lite Drive-in Theater" was observed by him and others. 
The object, Smith says, was about the shape of a disc but seemed to be surrounded by a "cloud" that obscured its outline. It appeared to be about 2,000 to 3,000 feet in the air, traveling an estimated 500 to 600 miles an hour. During the 5 to 7 minutes the object was in sight, it moved to a point over another section of the city and then disappeared. Smith said the object made no noise and gave off no trail of any kind. He estimated its size to be greater than that of a conventional aircraft.
Smith says he saw the object again about an hour later, this time in another part of the city. He said the "cloud" around it seemed more pronounced on this second sighting and that the object appeared to be maneuvering or changing direction. Again it disappeared from sight after a few minutes.
The Spartanburg Journal report states that several other persons in the city also reported seeing the object.

SUBJECT: "FLYING THING"
FROM: PAO-49, Spartanburg, S. C.
TO: Chief, SID Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio

On 24 July 1950, Mr. T.T.F., a reporter for the Spartanburg Herald Journal, was interviewing Mrs. Gwynne, when he was informed by her about a "FLYING THING" that was reported seen by her Saturday night, 22 July 1950. Mrs. Gwynne and her husband were at the Star Light Drive-In Theater, which is located North East of Spartanburg, on the Asheville, N.C. highway. They were attending the last show, which started approximately 9:30 p.m. As their car was stopped watching the picture for only a short while, when Mr. Gwynne noticed an object in the sky which was round and made a slight surface shine as it reflected from a bright surface. The object was being reflected off and was an estimated two thousand (2,000) feet in the air and they watched the object for several minutes before Mrs. Gwynne got out of the automobile and went to the car that was parked in front of theirs to see if they had also observed the object. By that time the object had disappeared; however, only a few minutes later the object appeared again in the same place. Mrs. Gwynne kept track of the object's location by sighting from a light pole which the object appeared to pass on the left and a little to the right and she and her husband both observed the object. Approximately 5 minutes before the object disappeared again, the object appeared a third time and seemed to have lowered and a little more to the right of the position that it was observed the first and second time the object appeared. The bottom, which was round and the shape of a saucer, was being reflected from a bright surface suspended in the air. Mr. Gwynne stated that each time the object appeared it was surrounded by a slight amount of smoke, which he does not believe was a glow as he may have assumed could have been steam and clouds could have covered the object. The object did not move while it was visible to him and that it appeared to remain in the same place. The third time it appeared it had moved and was considerably lower and to the right of the position it was before. Mr. Gwynne stated that it was difficult to estimate its size and altitude, but it appeared to him that the bottom surface of the object was around two hundred (200) feet in diameter. He states it was about 2,000 feet altitude and was approximately 1200 yards from where he was observing it. Mr. Gwynne stated that he did not know what the object was, but that he had never seen anything like it before and that UNCLASSIFIED.

UNCLASSIFIED
Mr, his wife, and the other 2 observers all agreed that it's structural appearance was inconsistent with any aircraft known to the 4 of them, or that it could be a planet, and that it was very distinctly by all 4 observers and a discussion as to what it was and how to describe it better went on for approximately an hour after it had disappeared the last time. Mr. stated that he did not try to bring the object to anyone else's attention, other than the two men in the car next to him. The first and second time the object appeared to him, it was slightly visible and it was possibly a planet. The third time it appeared it was so large and looked so weird that his attention was called to the others as they were afraid that it would be best not bring it to the attention of the others as they were afraid that it would cause a disturbance.

On 24 July 1950, Mr. Control Tower Operator, Memorial Airport, Spartanburg, S. C., was interviewed and stated that he was on duty at the control tower on Monday night 22 July until 2400 hours and that he did not see anything out of the ordinary that might have been reported having been seen by others. He stated that he did not know who might have seen the object unless it was Mr. a also a control tower operator, who relieved him at 2400 hours that night. Mr. stated that he was off duty until 1600 hours, Thursday 27 July 1950 and is believed to be in Atlanta, Ga., at the present.
