11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The object was described as a bright stationary light in the southwest sky which was observed over a 3 hour period. The light appeared to be of uniform brightness and color, remaining stationary except for minor fluctuations in intensity. No definite shape could be determined. At times the object appeared to flare up and then dim down. The object was also observed by several other witnesses in the area. Based on the description and observed characteristics, the object is considered to be an astronomical (optical) phenomenon, possibly a star or planet.
