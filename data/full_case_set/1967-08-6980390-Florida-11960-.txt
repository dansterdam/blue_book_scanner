Project Blue Book 
Subject: Sighting of Unidentified Flying Objects on 6 August 1967 in Florida

Witness Name: REDACTED
Occupation: REDACTED

Location: REDACTED, Florida
Date: 6 August 1967
Time: Approximately 2100 hours

Description of Sighting: 
The witness observed 3 round objects of bright white light moving across the sky in an irregular pattern, sometimes forming a triangular formation. The objects were estimated to be 1,000 feet in altitude and moving at an estimated speed of 500-600 mph. The sighting lasted for approximately 3-5 minutes before the objects disappeared from view. No sound was heard.

The witness reported the incident to the USAF and provided the above information. No determination was made as to the nature of the objects observed. The case was filed and classified as "Insufficient Information" due to the lack of definitive data to identify the source of the sighting.

The image shows a black and white photograph depicting a night sky with some faint stars visible. There are three distinct streaks of light that appear to be moving across the sky, suggesting the presence of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The background appears to be dark, with no clear indication of any other objects or landmarks.

Project Blue Book was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1952 to 1969. This image appears to be a page from one of the reports produced as part of that investigation.

UFOS OBSERVED AT APALACHICOLA, FLORIDA 
OBSERVATIONS: At approximately 10:30 pm, EDT, on 6 August 1967, three elongated lights, traveling in a straight line and at a constant speed, were observed moving across the sky in a general NE to SW direction. The objects appeared to be at a high altitude and were observed for approximately 60 seconds before disappearing from view.
The lights were described as being elongated in shape, yellowish in color, and emitting no trail. The objects maintained a constant speed and direction throughout the observation period.
EXPLANATION: No explanation for the observed objects is offered. The objects did not conform to the characteristics of any known aircraft, satellite, or other natural phenomena. The objects were viewed by several reliable observers, and their descriptions were consistent. The report is considered to be of sufficient credibility to warrant further investigation.
