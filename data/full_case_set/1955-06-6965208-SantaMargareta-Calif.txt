The image does not contain any photographs, but rather an "UFOB INDEX CARD" that describes a sighting of a single object in Santa Margarita, California on June 5, 1955. The card includes details such as the date, location, type of observation, number of objects, and a brief description of the sighting.

Now, I will transcribe the text from the document:

5 June 1955  
DAYTIME GROUP  
Local 05/18/55, POST June 55  
CAT IV, June 1955  
1. DATE  
5 June 1955  
2. LOCATION  
Santa Margarita, California  
3. TYPE OF OBSERVATION  
Ground-Visual  
4. SOURCE  
Civilian  
5. PHOTOS  
 Yes  No  
6. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION  
Still in sight at time  
7. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING  
One (1) round, white object, the size of a small of a small house at arm's length, was observed for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. It moved in a northeast direction.  
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS  
One (1)  
9. COURSE  
Stationary  
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING  
Two reports arrived from approximately the same place (1.5 miles apart) and at the same time. The ground observer outside Camp San Luis Obispo said they took place at almost the same time. By coincidence or the two we see they are possibly the same sighting. Due to the fact that many brilliant objects are reported in these sightings, these sighting could fulfill the description of a Balloon. Possibly Balloon.
11. CONCLUSIONS  
 Was Balloon  
 Possibly Balloon  
 Was Aircraft  
 Possibly Aircraft  
 Was Astronomical  
 Possibly Astronomical
