Dear Sir,
On August 28 1966 at about 8:25 p.m. the writer observed an unidentified aerial object over Kettering, Ohio. The object first appeared to be hovering at about 2000 ft altitude and then moved off rapidly to the southwest. The object appeared to be round or elliptical in shape and emitted a bright orange glow. As the object moved away it appeared to change color from orange to white. The duration of the sighting was approximately 3-5 minutes.
(1) Yellowish-orange was the color
(2) lighted the side of a tree in a field 
(3) Bright the size of a star in the sky on a clear night
(4) Descended: one
(5) Unmentionable features: Blinking

(1) sounding a siren call to R.F.C.
(1) northeast
(2) flight paths and direction and
(3) Daylight time indicator of when the object was observed. The duration of the sighting was approximately 3 minutes. This object was observed at 9:50 pm. This object was observed to move at a very high speed, estimated to be around 2000 mph. It appears to have come from the east and gone west.

Dear [redacted],

Reference your unusual photographs which were forwarded to our office for analysis.

Photographic analysis revealed the following: Slide #1 - a normal one or two good transparencies highly magnified. There may also be some bad transparencies. This unusual quality of the transparencies may be due to the fact that they appear to contain shadows that do not appear on a normal good transparency.

The higher the magnification, the more focus on lack of focus can be observed. The image on slide #7 could be the image of an object. Any identification from the submitted photographs would be only speculation.

Your interest in Project Blue Book is appreciated. Please return your slides. Thank you for submitting them for our evaluation.

Dear [REDACTED],

Reference your unusual photographs which were forwarded to our office for detailed photographic study. Photographic analysis revealed the following: slide #1 is a normally exposed good quality transparency with one water spot or chip in emulsion probably caused in processing. Slide #7 may also be a good transparency, highly magnified. It may also be some object or reflection of some shape other than shown, but made to appear as two lobes with high lights and shadows by the extent of or lack of focus. The higher the magnification, the more focus can alter the image's size and shape. The image on slide #7 could be of an object, a light source, or a reflection of a light source. Any identification of the submitted photographs would be only speculation.

Your interest in Project Blue Book is appreciated. Darn retaining your slides. Thank you for submitting them to the Air Force for evaluation.

The image contains a photograph analysis report. The report states that the photography includes 8-35 mm color transparencies, 8 B&W 8 x 10 prints, and 8-35 mm B&W negatives. The purpose of the report is to analyze Work Order Number 67-12 submitted by Major H. Quintanilla, Jr. for analysis and determination of the objects' identities.

The analysis section describes the slides and prints, noting that slide #1 appears to be a normally exposed good quality transparency, and slide #7 may show a ship in emulsion possibly caused by processing. The report also describes the apparent movement and reflection of the objects in the slides, and mentions that the linear patterns shown in slides #12 and #13 may indicate trails of smoke, gas, vapor, or exhaust.

The OCR output of the text in the document is as follows:

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT NR 67-9 PAGE 1 OF 2 PAGES
DATE OF REPORT 14 February 1967
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS, CLINTON, MISSOURI
LOCATION CLINTON, MISSOURI
DATE AUG, SEPT, OCT 66
PHOTOGRAPHY
8 - 35 mm Color Transparencies, 8 B&W 8 x 10 Prints, 8 - 35 mm B&W Negatives
1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to answer Work Order Number 67-12 submitted by
Major H. Quintanilla, Jr. for an analysis and determination of the objects' identities, if
possible.
2. ANALYSIS:
a. Slides #1 & #7, from this analysis, appear to be as follows: #1 is a normally
exposed good quality transparency with one water spot or ship in emulsion probably caused
in processing. #7 may also show a ship in emulsion, but the details are not as clearly
defined. This condition may be the result of processing or of a dust particle on the
slide and is not of major significance.
b. Slides #10, and #11, were taken in the hours of near darkness
and slides #12 and #13 were taken in daylight. All four of these slides appear to have been
taken through the same window or nearly so, and all appear to show approximately the same
object or group of objects. Slide #10 shows what appears to be a source of light or
similar illumination, Slide #11 shows what may be a reflection or shadow of the same light
source, or a similar subsequent light source in the same approximate position.
Dependence upon the time lapse between frames, but do show changes occurring.
Slide #12 and #13 appear to show a trail or trail-like pattern, possibly indicating the
movement of the object and make the object or image appear longer. These conditions
have been met and the object or image has a longer density and appears smaller. An aircraft
compared to the same object is much larger and has a more significant wing span.
c. Slides #12 and #13 show linear patterns such as smoke, gas, vapor or exhaust
trails. These patterns appear to approximately the same as the lights or reflections in slides
#10 and #11. The linear patterns of the object in slides #12 and #13 are nearly parallel to the
apparent movement of the light in slides #1 and #11. The similarity of implied motion in these three
of the frames, together with the linear patterns noting in the same axis and
same direction, such as traffic on an airport approach or runway.

JUN 13 1967

Dear M

Reference your recent correspondence regarding your observation and observations photograph of an unidentified flying object (UFO)-. 

Examination of the submitted negative has negated double exposure and/or multiple image appearance of the negative revealed. Say smaller image is in addition to the bright light which is visible on the negative. This is rather unusual in appearance since the focus of the bright light was moved rather than the image moving to indicate the photograph was taken. Rotation around center of bright light produced this effect, normal exposure and focus was maintained. Without specific details, there is no way to determine what produced the image.

That the description of the visual observation is consistent with above conditions. The speed and motion operate is estimate, proper conditions prevail, they cannot be heard. Lack of sound is not valid reason to exclude encounter, the distorted image prevents hearing and detail recording of sighting although it was not photographed. 

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

The image appears to contain a typed report or document describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting that occurred in Minneapolis, Minnesota. There is no photograph included in this particular page.

As an OCR system, I will now extract the text from the document:

Gentleman of the Air Forces:

I have photos of a UFO. You people will call it something else, due to the fact that you put down people who tell the truth about these things until the time comes when they are proved to be right in our time and space or not.

My name is E. J. live in Minneapolis, Minn. On Aug. 2, 1966, at approx. 7:30 pm, the object was going south in the eastern sky. It was not a plane, it did not have the type motors, running lights, etc that planes have. I filmed the film somewhere, and was not able to find it again. It looked like pictures in late magazines on current subjects and that is the type object that was at about 2 or 3 thousand feet we would estimate.

Time was about 7:00 & 7:30 pm. No airplane was around at that time.

Path was zig-zag, shutter of camera was open at about 4 to 5 seconds, exposure was also not too long, and the film has unusual markings and shadows on it caused by the strange object. Sometimes, and made-made material in the sky does not zig-zag.

Speed was about or over 1000 miles per hour.

Color of object was orangeish-white and looked more disk than round.

Sky was clear ( see stars in picture ). There was no lightning, nor was it a child's kite. And there was no heat or sound of any kind connected with the object. I got the tail of the path of the object, but do not know much about the object itself, other that it made pictures out of the negative, said "I don't know what the object is-".

Please send photo back to:
Minneapolis, Minn.

The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, which contains a letter discussing the examination of a submitted negative and related observations.

Proposed reply to letter from [redacted]

Dear [redacted]:

Reference your recent correspondence regarding your observation and subsequent photograph of an unidentified flying object.

Examination of the submitted negative has negated double exposure and/or retouch. Close inspection of the negative reveals many smaller images in addition to the bright image which is visible on the prints. These smaller images appear to follow a course parallel to the path of the bright image, indicating that the camera was moved rather than the images moving as the photograph was taken. Rotation should be made of the fact that the images are located in the trailer section of the film and not in a normal frame position. Without specific details, there is no way to determine what produced the images.

The description of the visual observation is consistent with that of an aircraft sighting. Jet aircraft operating at altitudes above 20,000 to 25,000 feet can be usually observed; however, unless proper conditions prevail, they cannot be heard. Lack of sound is not a valid reason to exclude an aircraft. After detailed investigation, it appears an aircraft could have been responsible for the sighting, although it was not photographed.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Text extracted from the document:

Gentleman of the Air Force:

I have photos of a UFO. You people will call it something else, but this is the fact, that you can't deny. The United States government admits that life does exist on other planets, if they are in our air space and among us.

My name is Kevin Dicks, I live in Minneapolis, Minn. I saw a UFO on a clear day in the western sky. It was not a airplane, it was not a meteor or any known phenomenon.

I heard a UFO make a noise, and this is the motion picture I took of the object. And was, not able to find it, if I took pictures in the last August or early October(1966). The object did not pass over the trees and not ahead. The object was in the sky at about 2/3 of the overhead sky to the ground.

Time was about 7:00 & 7:30 p.m. No airplane was around at that time. The shutters of camera was open at about 4 to 5 seconds. Camera was also not moving and was on a base that did mod move by anything. Color of object was orangeish-white and looked more disc than round.

Sky was clear (see stars in picture). There than, there was no hittitness in sky and the object was right in about 4/5 of the sky between the object, and the ground. I have never seen the tail of the path of the object. The object did not make any noise, I can recall if i heard it make a whisper, who made silence out of the negative, said "I don't know what the object is".

Please send photo back to: Kevin Dicks, Minneapolis, Minn.

in front of: _____________

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound _________________
b. Color ____living light gold_____

18. We wish to know the angular size. Held a match stick or one's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? ________about 1/4________

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails.
Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

Dear Mrs. I_________________:

Reference your letter of 10 September 1966 in which you stated that you had photographs taken from the surface of the moon into a sunset.

A photographic analysis of your color transparencies revealed the following: The photography provided indicates central core fraction with an undetermined number of secondary refractions or reflections of the iris diaphragm in and on the optical system. The circles within the images appear to be diffraction patterns.

This is a perfect textbook example of a camera imaging its own lens diaphragm.

DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT:
In this case an atmospheric phenomenon was involved. The observer saw a bright light in the sky which at times appeared to break into smaller lights and then regroup into a single light. This effect was apparently caused by the light passing through varying lenticular atmospheric layers of differing refractive indexes. This caused a refraction and dispersion effect similar to that seen in a prism. The witness was mistakenly interpreting this as a "disintegrating" or "reforming" UFO.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely part of Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate UFO sightings.

The text in the document reads:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 1 Nov 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

I have the impression that I was sitting in the kitchen of my home looking out through the window. The sky was overcast with a low ceiling of clouds. Suddenly a bright, silvery,metallic object appeared in the sky above the trees out of nowhere and remained stationary for a few seconds. I pointed it out to my daughter who was also in the kitchen with me. She also saw the object. Suddenly the object accelerated and disappeared into the clouds. I considered calling the authorities at the time but decided against it for fear they would not believe me.

Lt Colonel George Freeman's letter has fascinated me for some time. I was thinking about his comments on the need to approach the question of Unidentified Flying Objects in a more serious scientific manner. I procured this questionnaire hoping that my experience, though apparently trivial, might be of some use in contributing to a better understanding of this phenomenon. However, I feel that the data it elicits would serve little purpose. Accurate recording and analyses of the many sightings which undoubtedly occur each month would be far more valuable than the sporadic and sketchy information obtained from a few selected witnesses. The resources devoted to this project would, in my opinion, be better employed in more fruitful areas of scientific research.

Gentlemen:
My name is [redacted] and I would like to submit the following UFO report.
On August 22, 1966, at approximately 7:30 p.m. EST my friend [redacted] and I were observing the sun more closely (we are both amateur astronomers). Taking a brief rest, we decided to take a stroll. As we glanced into the sky, we noticed what appeared to be two ordinary airplanes. At the time, the sun was setting so features on the ground were obscured. My friend noticed that the object had two flashing red lights, one at each tip. It appeared to be hovering and did not move. As the object approached zenith, I noticed it seemed to be slightly smaller than the green light of the sun. The object appeared motionless. At zenith the red and green lights went out, leaving a dull, yellow light that was apparently glowing in altitude. As the object approached zenith, the features were no longer distinguishable. It returned and finally disappeared in the west. Period of visibility was one minute, fifteen seconds.
Would you please give me your opinion of the sighting?
Yours truly,
[Redacted]

Gentlemen:
My name is [redacted] and I would like to submit the following report.
On August 22, 1966, at approximately 7:30 p.m., my [redacted] and I were observing the moon with my telescope in our back yard. As we glanced into the sky we noticed that appeared to be a star moving very rapidly. As it came closer we noticed it was no star. It seemed to be an unidentifiable object. My friend noticed the object had two lights on one side, one white and one red. The object was oblong in shape. As it passed over us, I noticed the main rectangular part of the craft. It seemed to give off a greenish-white light. When the object was nearest to us, I noticed the main rectangular part of the craft. It seemed to give off a greenish-white light. When the object was nearest to us, I noticed the main rectangular part of the craft. After it was past us and starting to go away, I noticed the two lights, still one white and one red, on the object. The object then began to speed up and was soon beyond the range of the telescope. It curved and finally disappeared beyond the horizon.
Very recently I reported this sighting to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and this committee was very interested in the report.
In order that the object might become more clear, I have drawn a diagram I hope will illustrate the sighting. Would you please give me your personal opinion of the sighting?

scientific investigation would have been undertaken. Your report
will be filed for information purposes only.
Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Gentlemen:
My name is [REDACTED] and I would like to submit the following.
On August 22, 1966, at approximately 7:30 p.m., my friend, [REDACTED], and I were observing the moon with my 6" Newtonian telescope (we are both amateur astronomers). Taking a brief rest, we decided to take a look around the sky. We noticed what appeared to be a weird flying object. At the time the sun was setting so features on the object were difficult to distinguish. My friend noticed the object had two green lights. The green light was slightly larger than the white light. When the object was near zenith, the two lights disappeared and only a uniform, yellow, blink-like light was visible. The object was motionless for a time, then exhibited a drifting motion to the northeast. The object had appeared in the west. Period of visibility was about one minute and fifteen seconds.
Very recently I reported this sighting to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and this committee was very enthusiastic about it.
In order that the object might become more clear, I have drawn a diagram of the object below. I assure you this sighting is not a hoax. Would you please give me your personal opinion of the sighting?
Yours truly,
[REDACTED]

REPLY TO
ATTN OF: TDSTR

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 23 August 1966

TO: Hq USAF (SAFOI OI)

1. Reference the attached letter concerning unidentified observations. This letter was forwarded to the Operations Office, U.S. Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi, Texas.

2. We have unable to specifically identify the aircraft which he observed on 23 August 1966. In the Texas area, there are many conventional and jet aircraft training activities, including USAF pilot training operations, Naval pilot training, and other military aircraft movements. The description given, in particular, is suggestive of aerospace functions, for they are the builders of the ECHO I satellite.

3. We feel that the observed ECHO I satellite on 23 August 1966, which was near the reported time of the sighting, could well account for this observation. ECHO I is clearly visible to the naked eye on a clear night.

FOR THE COMMANDER

Dear M.....

Your letter to the International Airport at Corpus Christi, Texas, has been referred to this office for reply.

We are unable to specifically identify the aircraft which you observed on August 16, 1966. In the Texas area, there are many conventional and experimental aircraft of various types which could be responsible for the observation. For example, it is not uncommon for aircraft engaged in aerospace research to exhibit unusual maneuvers or flight characteristics.

We feel you observed the ECHO II satellite on August 28 which was heading in a southeasterly direction at 2257 CDT. ECHO II is a 135-foot diameter inflatable satellite which is readily visible on a clear night.

Your interest is appreciated.

Sincerely,

GEORGE F. FREEMAN, JR.

Gentlemen:

Would you be so kind as to tell me what the following
flight movements were, or forward this letter to someone who can.

1) On August twenty-three at 1:20 pm I saw an aircraft moving over Ingleside, Texas. It was following a
curved course from West to East to North, was leaving
a contrail, but was moving at an incredible speed. The
only thing that set this particular craft off from any of a hundred
other high-flying planes I have seen was the fact that from a layman's point of view that it was moving
in excess of 1700 miles per hour.

2) On August twenty-eight around 9:30 p.m. perhaps
sometime after 10:00 p.m. I saw what appeared to be
a bright light moving from Southwest to Southeast. It
was only able to watch it for about 10 minutes
before it disappeared into the light of the moon.

Thank you very much for your kind attentions.

Sincerely,
