The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The document contains a series of questions and blank spaces for the witness to fill out their observations about a UFO sighting.

The text in the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? The object did not disappear, it just got very small and then went off into the distance.

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? The object was all covered by the tip of a match stick.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. The document contains a hand-drawn sketch of a large, disc-shaped object with a dome at the top.
