AT LAWTON, OKLAHOMA
On 16 October 1951, Mrs. ___ of Lawton, Oklahoma, was interviewed and stated in substance that on 31 August 1951 at approximately 1845 hours, while driving on the highway from White Flat to Matador, Texas, she observed an object which appeared to be about the same size as a Piper Cub airplane approximately 1-2 miles from her at an altitude of 200-300 feet. The object was between 125-150 yards from her automobile and looked to be about the same size as a bushel basket. It appeared to be glowing and made no sound. The object remained stationary for a brief period, then appeared to be bouncing or bobbing up and down, and finally disappeared in a "flash" over a mesquite thicket in the landing area.

Mrs. ___ stated that when she first sighted the object it appeared to be floating as a glowing object. As she drew closer the object appeared to be hovering in a stationary position and then it suddenly disappeared from sight. There was no noise nor sign of exhaust or smoke. The object appeared to be floating at approximately the same height as the derrick on the Job's oil well. (Described in referenced report as 120' overall height.)

In describing the object, Mrs. ___ stated that the only object which resembled the shape of the object was that of a pear. She further stated that the object appeared to be a door or window located on the tapered end of the object; that the object was flying with the tapered end forward. The luminous part of the object made an accurate glow and made no sound.

AGENT'S NOTE: Mrs. ___ appeared sincere and honest in her description of this incident and impressed this agent as an intelligent and serious individual.

MATADOR, TEXAS - 31 AUGUST 1951

I. DISCUSSION OF THE INCIDENT:
On 31 August 1951 at approximately 1:45 CST two civilian were driving in an automobile north of Matador, Texas. They noticed a bright light in the sky, apparently the size of a basketball, which readily reflected the sunlight. The object had a dark spot or core, which readily reflected the sunlight. The object had a dark spot or core, which appeared to be in the center of the main object. There was no sign of any exhaust and no noise was heard.

As the two individuals were driving northward, the object followed, the driver of the automobile first noticed the object about 150 yards ahead of the automobile. The object followed and both individuals observed the object until it disappeared from sight. It was drifting slowly in an eastward direction and appeared to be less than the speed they were traveling. Approximately 1-2 minutes later the object began to ascend rapidly and moved out of sight.

A background investigation showed that both witnesses were of excellent character.

This incident is of interest because it was observed during the same period as the objects over Lubbock, Texas (see Appendix I).

II. WEATHER:
A. 1:30 CST - Matador, Texas - 31 August 1951
Estimated ceiling: 6,000 ft., with thin scattered cirrus clouds, visibility 15 miles.
B. 1:30 CST - Childress, Texas - 31 August 1951
Estimated ceiling: 25,000 ft., overcast. Visibility 15 miles. Vind NE at 7 knots, temperature 88, clouds in 12 quadrants.

III. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION:
It has been reported that a road repair crew saw the same object later on the same day. Attempts will be made by project personnel to contact this crew and determine whether there were any additional reports or cross checking activity in the area, so attempts will be made to determine whether or not the witness could have seen this activity.

MATADOR, TEXAS - 31 August 1951

On 31 August 1951 at approximately 12:46 CST two ladies were driving in an automobile several miles north of Matador, Texas. The object was described as a circular-shaped object, about the size of a basketball, which suddenly appeared in the sky. The object was a definite metallic color and was moving at a speed estimated to be about 1000 miles per hour. The object was seen for about 15 seconds and no noise was heard.

As the two ladies were driving north from Matador, they suddenly noticed the object coming toward them at a high rate of speed. It appeared to be about 3 miles away. The object then stopped abruptly and began moving slowly in an eastward direction. It was observed for about 10 seconds. Seconds later the object began to ascend and in a few seconds disappeared. (Information at this point is based on the affidavit of the witnesses.)

A background investigation of the witnesses was made and their character was found to be of excellent reputation.

Weather:
a. 12:00 CST - Winds NW 5-7 miles per hour, temperature 90 degrees.
b. 12:23 CST - Winds NW 5-7 miles per hour, temperature 90 degrees.
c. 12:50 CST - Drifting SSE 3-5 miles per hour, partly cloudy, visibility 8 miles.

Status of Investigation:
It has been reported that a small animal was the object later observed, the report will be declassified due to insufficient evidence to confirm the sighting as being classified as a genuine unidentified flying object. There were also reports of "crop dusting" activity in the locality at the time, which may have contributed to the incident.

MATADOR, TEXAS - 22 August 1951

On 22 August 1951 at approximately 1:45 CST two ladies were driving in an automobile south of Matador, Texas. The object was described as a pear-shaped object, similar to an ellipse or ellipter in color, which refracted sunlight on some type of surface. It moved through the air at a very high speed, they judged faster than a jet plane. It made a sizzling or buzzing sound as it passed through the air. It maintained its course for about 30 seconds, then disappeared. There was a firm of any exhaust.

As the two ladies were driving north from Matador, Texas, the driver of the automobile first noticed the object. It appeared and disappeared within about 10 seconds. The object flew roughly in a northerly direction at an estimated speed of more than 1,000 mph. It was oval in shape and larger than the 5-seat required for the car. It was gray in color with no visible means of propulsion. In less than 10 seconds it moved out of sight to the west.

Status of Investigation
It has been reported that a road repair crew saw the same object later on the same day. Attempts will be made to contact members of this road crew and obtain their statements. There may also reports of crow hunting activity in the area, but if so, these would only account for a small portion of the incidents could have seen this activity.

MATADOR, TEXAS - 31 AUGUST 1951

On 31 August 1951 at approximately 2400 CST two Indians were driving in an automobile towards the town of Matador, Texas. The object was first sighted against the northern horizon. The object gave off a bright fluorescent glow. The object had a red or some type of pressure in the center. It moved through the air at a high rate of speed and forward. They judged the size to be about that of a T-33 fuselage. There was no sign of any exhaust.

As the two Indians were driving north from Matador, towards the driver's sight, the object was observed approximately 3 miles high and about 5-7 knots distant. They stopped and both Indians got out to observe the object. It was brighter than the stars required to be observed at that time of night. The object was seen to be of a rounded, circular shape. After a period of time, the object moved rapidly out of sight at an estimated speed of over 1,000 mph.

A background investigation shows that both women were of excellent character.

This incident is of interest because it was observed during the same period as the objects over Lubbock, Texas (see Appendix D).

REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

TITLE: UNKNOWN SUBJECT; Unidentified Objects 
in Flight Over Lubbock, Texas

CHARACTER: SPECIAL INQUIRY

REFERENCE: Spot Intelligence Report, DO 923, File 29-0, dated 7 September 1951. 

Investigation conducted upon verbal request of Air Provost Marshal and 2nd Air Force on 18, 20, 21 September 1951. Based upon classified information in Spot Intelligence Report, DO 923, File 29-0, dated 7 September 1951, copies of which were made available by 2nd Air Force. This report concerns reports of unidentified objects sighted over Lubbock, Texas, during August and September 1951. The investigation was conducted by 2nd OSI District, Investigator.

On 16 August 1951, several citizens in Lubbock, Texas, reported seeing a formation of 40 to 50 unidentified objects flying at an estimated speed of 1,000 miles per hour at an altitude of about 500 feet. The unidentified objects were reported again on 31 August 1951. Mr. Carl Hart, Jr., a former B-29 gunner, reported seeing about 30 of the objects and estimated their size as approximately 1 1/2 times the size of a B-29 bomber. The objects were reported to be luminous, and to travel in a diagonal or triangular formation. They were reported to have been seen on several occasions. Mr. W. I. Investor, a former Air Force pilot, also reported seeing the objects on 31 August 1951. He stated that the objects appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and to have a metallic surface. They were reported to travel in a diagonal formation and then to scatter, each object traveling at a high rate of speed. 

Unauthorized disclosure of information is prohibited and will be considered a violation of AFR 205-1.

Synopsis (Continued)
This synopsis was taken by an operations officer and former
Special Agent, Air Material Command, who investigated this incident. According to the report, on 23 June 1951, at 1620 hours, a jet pilot near Matador, Texas, in the air at 28,000 feet, visibility 3-5 miles, observed an unidentified object which appeared to be about the same size as the jet but at a considerable distance. The object was observed to be moving rapidly and erratically compared to the jet. It was lost to sight after approximately 30 seconds. It is apparently the same case reported over Lubbock on 25 June 1951.
