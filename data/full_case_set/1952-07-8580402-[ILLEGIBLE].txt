3. Observation was visual from the ground.

4. Captain Dougher was in command of the initial "burst" appeared in the display. His lights appeared to be several miles away at an unknown altitude but seemed to be in formation.

5. Captain Dougher is a pilot, not currently on flying status. He is classified and visiting his mother at the time of observation.

6. The weather at the time of observation was clear, no clouds reported, and visibility more than fifteen (15) miles. Wind (0) miles.

7. No meteorological activity has been reported for this period.

PERIOD COVERED: 3 JULY 1952
LOCATION: SYRACUSE, NEW YORK
REPORT RECEIVED: 8 JULY 1952
EVALUATION: UNCLASSIFIED
SUMMARY: On 3 July 1952, at about 2300 hours, an unidentified flying object was sighted by this station (F-47) from the 500 Radar Center at Syracuse, New York. The object was spotted as a single sighting of 20 to 30 miles of apparent size at 15 miles range. It maneuvered in an unidentified flying pattern for a duration of 5 minutes. The object was observed to move rapidly, gaining altitude very high and disappearing from radar coverage. Ground observers were unable to locate the object visually.
After 22 37Z sightings were intermittent, object seemed to be losing altitude and an approach control was vectored to track the object. However, the object disappeared from radar coverage.
The authenticity of this report is unknown as information was very brief and given by only one source.
This object was not picked up on the radar at this site at any time.

1. The following information was received from the 25th OSI District, Detroit, Michigan, in a spot intelligence report dated 4 August 1952:

"Refers to following article on page 2 of 23 July 1952 edition of the 'Traverse City Record-Eagle', Traverse City, Michigan:

'AT LONG LAST 
FLYING SAUCER CLOSE TO GROUND*

10:30 a.m. - Flying saucers or one description or another have been reported in nearly every state during the past few years and at last Oceana, Michigan saw what they believe d was a flying saucer.'

Mrs. J.D. Detroit, who was vacationing at the Otsego Club near Gaylord, Michigan, and her mother, Mrs. Leotis Cobb, both of Detroit, who were visiting in Oceana on Lake Huron saw what they believe d was a flying disc during Sunday about 1:30 P.M.

'The white light, when first noticed, was approaching from the south and gradually rising to a northerly direction. It appeared circular in form and as it passed through the sky, left what they described as a vapor trail behind it. The light first came into view at an estimated height of about 3000 feet and as it neared the observers, appeared to be about 1000 feet high. Estimating speed, Mrs. Detroit said it looked like a jet moving at a very high rate of speed. She added, "It made no noise, just seemed to be coasting. When it passed over us, it turned a silvery color, then faded into the distance".'

This is an interesting case, with two witnesses who are thoroughly familiar with planes, weather balloons, etc. 
Objects discovered are approximate 100 degrees in 45 seconds, had no visible aerodynamic features, had a bright afterglow and a gyrating movement. No sound. Object seemed to climb higher every second and move from in front of a cumulus cloud to in back of it. This object giving some evidence of distance. Object observed in thorough investigation since there were two adult witnesses and one 16-year old witness. It must be classed as unknown. I have rated it as a 2 C.

10. 25 June 1952, Japan/Korea area.
This is not a single report but a collection of 13 similar reports which occurred in 1951 and 1952. No adequate explanation has been given by the radar expert for any of them and therefore I can as any judgement as to their cause. This is one strictly for the radar experts.

11. 22 July 1952, Maxwell, Texas.
Evaluation as possible meteor is not tenable if object was seen to climb from 8,000 feet to 14,000 feet, then to hover, then to drop at an angle of 45 degrees, continue hovering, and fly around an area of 100 feet. This does not appear to fit the pattern of a meteor. There were clearly indications which should have been followed up in this identification: insufficient follow-up, or insufficient information.

12. 22 July 1952, Uvalde, Texas.
This is an interesting case, with two witnesses. Chief witness was the weather observer for Trans-Texas Airlines, who was thoroughly familiar with all planes, weather balloons, etc. Object covered an arc of approximately 100 degrees in 4-5 seconds, had no visible aerodynamic features, and a bright illumination. It climbed vertically very rapidly every second and moved from in front of a cumulus cloud to 1 back of it, then giving some estimate of 6 distance. Object observed in broad daylight. It is too bad that this one was not much more thoroughly investigated than it appears two adult witnesses and one 14-year old witness. Rated it as 92 67.

13. 24 July 1952, Carson Sink, Nevada.
Sighting just three to four seconds in duration, too short a time to make any definite observations. Case must be carried as unidentified.

14. 28 December 1953, Marysville, California.
A one-witness case. Even though observed by a fairly qualified witness it is very strange that there were no other witnesses since incident took place in a populated area.

SUMMARY: (Enter concise summary of report. Give significant in first one-sentence paragraph. List enclosures if any. Single line of report on AF Form 112--Part II.)

The objects were sighted at Lubbock, Texas at 9:15 pm on 22 Jul 52. They were seen by several citizens, including a teacher and some students. The objects appeared as a group of lights numbering from 30 to 50, moving in a formation and disappearing for short periods. The objects were soundless and appeared to be more than normal. The exact nature and identity of the objects are unknown.

The objects were observed again at Lubbock, Texas at 9:45 pm on July 22, 1952. They appeared as before, disappearing and reappearing in the southern sky. Their movements were erratic and fairly high in the sky.

The objects were again observed at Lubbock, Texas at 11:20 pm on July 22, 1952. They behaved as on the previous two occasions.

The sightings were reported to the 4925th Air Intelligence Squadron at Carswell AFB, Texas, and the 8th Air Rescue Squadron at Carswell AFB, Texas. Photographs were taken but have not been developed.

At approximately 2130 hours, 19 July 1952, I was flying at 6000 feet, in a T-33 jet trainer, approx. 15 miles east of Manchester, New Hampshire, on a heading of 359 degrees, when I suddenly observed near the horizon, a bright light which appeared stationary. This light was a brilliant white, about twice the size of a bright star, and in a constant position for several minutes.
As I observed this light, it suddenly began to move in a zig-zag manner, then in a sharp right-angled course, and in a few seconds, then accelerated to a speed that seemed in the neighborhood of 1000 to 2000 miles per hour. It followed by a slight pink, then blue-white trail, as it shot through the sky. As it moved, it suddenly reversed course and headed back on essentially the same path, only to repeat the same maneuver. This was done in the space of only a few seconds, with no appreciable loss of speed or altitude.
Being about 1 1/2 minutes into the incident, I decided to close on the object to take a closer look. As I did so, the object again reversed its course and accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed, moving from one to two seconds, then suddenly faded from sight. Assuming that this was a meteor or some similar astronomical phenomena, I would estimate the speed at two thousand miles per hour.
Sketch below is the general shape of subject object:

STATEMENT:

At approximately 2130, on 18 July 1952, I was in the Mobile Control Van at Osterburg Air Force Base, Manchester, New Hampshire.

When I observed a bright comet-type object descending through the trees, at a speed comparable to a fast jet aircraft. It appeared to be moving from northwest to southeast. At a shallow angle of descent at a speed comparable to a fast jet aircraft. The object seemed to be below ten thousand feet although I could not pinpoint the exact altitude. I observed it for approximately 45 seconds to 1 minute, during which time I could plainly see a definite trail (short) and a bright glow within the object (something like burning magnesium). At the time it appeared directly over Manchester, suddenly disappeared from the object and a few seconds later a puff of smoke came from the area where the object had been. It would seem that the main body of the object had descended to earth, creating the impression the object or similar size has crashed or came down.

In conclusion I believe the object to be a meteorite or similar heavenly body.

1. At approximately 2:35 hours, 17 July 1952, the undersigned was working at the "94th position" and monitoring the 1200A frequency. The aircraft was a P-47's, Raymond 35.
2. The mobile control unit was in position for runway 17 and was tuning in to the tower frequency of 126.18. The weather was 17 and visibility was good.
3. The object was at about 200 feet when it first appeared and descended before it
disappeared. The object appeared to be of a brilliant white light, and it was about 200 feet
in diameter. The object showed up on the APS-42 equipment and was. . . [ILLEGIBLE]
4. The object was in sight for about four seconds so those are the details we can furnish
on this unidentified flying object. The runway control officer and the pilot both reported
the object and the pilot replied he had seen the object and the pilot replied that he had
seen it also.
5. The tower personnel thought no more of it until General Powers called the officer who
was working that he had talked to General Cabell who stated that this object had
operations in control that he would take the necessary action. Thus, we have reported this
unidentified flying object, and I believe it will be investigated fully.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES
STATEMENT

This was scrambled from Misawa Air Base, at approximately 2001 hours, 8 Jul 52. It was at an approximate altitude of 10,000 feet, proceeding at a high rate of speed toward the southwest. It was observed to travel a distance of approximately 5 miles in approximately 5 minute(s) (5) and disappear to the west. 
A civilian pilot, who was flying at 9,500 feet, reported that he saw a greenish-white light approaching his aircraft. The pilot stated that the light appeared much brighter than the intensity of the running lights on his aircraft, and was traveling in a straight line. The radar operator was directing his attention to the scope at the time of the encounter. The object dove toward the scope and tried to follow it down, but reportedly dove below the scope coverage. A search of the area showed nothing unusual.

Dix TRAB Comments:
The "strange phenomenon" referred to in the statement by Captain Lamb was very brief in duration. As approximate 5-minute sighting of an object traveling several miles indicates nothing except a very brief observation which leaves no certainty of the true nature of the phenomenon. The radar operator was apparently distracted by other tasks at the critical moment, and missed making an accurate identification or tracking of the object. Little of value can be determined from this incident other than to note the report that it was seen and could not be tracked further.

Air Force Intelligence:
Dear Sirs,
I want to report a strange object I saw at 11:00 p.m. on the night of July 23-52. Also I have a rough sketch of the object and will enclose with this letter. Below is how I saw it.
After listening to the Democratic Conv. at 11:00 p.m. of 7-23-52 I went outside about the sky, for I had read in the past week of flying saucers reportedly seen over Louisville, and after that I begin looking for them, for I had previously saw them in 1948 & 1949. I live in Russel Co. which is located in the S. Eastern part of Ky. At time I saw object it was S. West of me, at a range I would say of from 50 miles to 150 miles., and at a height of around 5,000 ft. Its movement was West North West while I watched it. It moved in a bouncing line to the North for what I thought to be 5 to 10 miles, then it seemed to make a xxx slight swinging motion, and then it begin a dive toward the earth for what seemed to be 500 ft. and it looked as if it just stopped, but as I watched on it begin to fade into the distance.
There was no sound, and the distance I was from it. It looked about 2 to 3 ft. across.
What I have said and the sketch I have submitted resembles what I saw here in Russel Springs, and so I am writing to report this.
Sincerely,
[REDACTED]

Carson Sink, Nevada
July 2zt, 1952

Three unidentified flying objects (UFOs) were observed by two Air Force Pilots in B-25 aircraft at 11,000 ft altitude on July 2h, 1952 at 1540 hours, PST. The objects were shaped like silver-white arrowheads (somewhat similar to a Delta wing aircraft) and appeared slightly larger than an F-86 aircraft. The speed was estimated as very fast; total observation time was three - four seconds. The time was too short to make any definite observations. The sighting is carried in Air Force files as unidentified.

Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla 
4 June

10. 25 June 1952, Japan/Korea area.
This is not a single report but a collection of 13 similar reports which occurred in 1951 and 1952. No adequate explanation has been given by the radar experts for any of them and therefore I can not as yet as any judgement as to their cause. This is one simply for the radar experts.

11. 22 July 1952, Maxwell, Texas.
Evaluation as possible meteor is not tenable if object was seen to climb from 2,000 feet to 14,000 feet, then to hover, then to drop 5,000 feet. It was reported by four air police and a staff sergeant. This is clearly a case which should have been followed up, but proper classification: insufficient followup, or insufficient information. 

12. 22 July 1952, Uvalde, Texas.
This is an interesting case, with two witnesses. The weather observer for Trans-Texas Airways was thoroughly familiar with planes, weather balloons, satellites, etc. He observed an object covered as an arc of approximately 100 degrees at an estimated distance of 2 miles. It was observed to have a gyrating movement. No sound. Object seemed to climb higher every few seconds and move from in front of a cumulus cloud to 3/4 back of it, thus giving some estimate of distance. Object observed for several minutes. It is too bad that this case had not been more thoroughly investigated since there were two adult witnesses and one is carried as unknown. I have rated it 12 of 15 of reliability.

13. 24 July 1952, Carson Sink, Nevada.
Sighting just three to four seconds in duration, too short a time for accurate identification. However, two trained Air Force colonels flying a B25 at 11,000 feet saw two qualified witnesses, case must be considered as unidentified (limited data).

14. 28 December 1953, Marysville, California. 
A onesightings case even though observed by a fairly qualified witness it is very strange that there were no other witnesses since the sighting occurred over a populated area.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
COUNTRY: United States
DATE: 24 May 1952
LOCATION: Las Vegas, Nevada
DESCRIPTION: Three white objects were reportedly observed to the northeast by the Nellis Air Force Base and civilian observers.
SIGNIFICANT DATA: The objects were observed at approximately 11:45 AM and were not conform to any known aircraft.
DRAWINGS OF US EXPERIMENTAL AIRCRAFT WERE SHOWN TO THE OBSERVERS BUT THEY COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE OBJECTS AS ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT.

Air Intelligence Information Report
1. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT: 
On 8 July 1952, at approximately 5:30 P.M. local time, a pilot, en route from Washington, D.C. to Cleveland, Ohio, observed a formation of unidentified objects at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet. The pilot described the objects as being circular in shape, glowing white in color, and traveling at high speed in an easterly direction. The pilot estimated the speed of the objects to be in excess of 600 knots. After observing the objects for approximately 2-3 minutes, they disappeared from view.

2. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION:
The sighting was reported to the Air Defense Command and investigated by Headquarters, 20th Air Division. According to the report, the pilot was considered to be a reliable observer. The report further stated that the sighting could not be explained in terms of any known aircraft or natural phenomena. The object observed did not conform to the characteristics of any type of aircraft known to be operating in the area.

3. CONCLUSIONS:
The investigating officer concluded that the objects observed could not be satisfactorily identified as any known type of aircraft or natural phenomenon. The report recommended that the incident be classified as "unidentified."

Horizon

- page 114 -

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch of an overhead view of the horizon. The sketch shows the position of an object when it was first seen (labeled "A") and when it was last seen (labeled "B"). The text instructs the viewer to draw a picture that shows the motion of the object, placing an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end. The text also describes the object's observed movements, stating that it was spotted approximately 60 degrees above the north-northwest horizon, moving slowly in a generally northward direction at an elevation of 10-15 degrees, and then disappearing beyond the north-northwest horizon.

Text extracted from the document:

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.
Overhead
A                   B
Horizon           You           Horizon

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.
I had noticed the object about 60 degree above the north-northwest horizon. It moved slowly in a generally northward direction at an elevation of 10-15 degrees and then disappeared beyond the north-northwest horizon.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
(The object showed a rather carrier-like configuration with dimensions that appeared to be roughly 50 feet long and 15 feet wide. It seemed to have fuzzy or hazy parameters - not a sharply defined object. It appeared to have a definite glow or luminosity - not merely reflecting light, but emitting it. This was not merely a point of light, but an extended, three-dimensional shape.)

Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary.

Answer to 1942-0:
These questions cannot be answered in terms of the classical physics. Because of the complete strangeness of the subject, I cannot estimate their distance and size in appearance, and there is no apparent speed also deducible in distance. Assuming they were of 10,000, they would have been about the size of a small flame each, and again assuming that altitude, they would have been traveling at 2000 - 3000 miles to have crossed the arc of the sky in 5 seconds. This time is short, but in my excellent position for observation. There are certainly no known or conventional meteorological phenomena.
