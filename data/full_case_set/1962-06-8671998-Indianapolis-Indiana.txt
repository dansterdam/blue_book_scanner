RADIO FOR RECORD:

On 13 July at 1000 my wife called me and said that she and her children had just observed a flying object. 
The time of sighting was verified at about 9:45AM. The object was first observed going in a southwest direction across the sky very high and at a rapid speed.
The interval between the sighting of the various objects was approximately 3 minutes. 
The first object was seen for about 3 seconds, the second object was seen for about 3 minutes. The time lapse between the first and second object was about 1 minute and 30 seconds. 
The second object appeared to be larger and moving at a somewhat slower speed. It appeared to be stationary for about 3 minutes. 
Visual sightings began about 9:45 AM. 
The investigator did not see the object only as it appeared to my wife and children. 
The object appeared to be silver in color, elliptical in shape and larger than the first object seen. It appeared to be descending or gaining altitude rather than remaining stationary. 
Visual sightings lasted approximately 3 to 5 minutes. 
The investigator does not feel that this could not be a meteor or satellite as the movement was controlled rather than a straight trajectory, and the object appeared to hover and was larger than a satellite would appear. 
The children, my wife, and I are reliable and responsible persons and we feel that this was no more a meteor or satellite than the first object seen but it was different in nature and unidentified.

THE DUTY Of FILLY RECORDSPART THREE

THIS IS THE COMPLETE TEXT OF THE DOCUMENT BASED ON OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION:

HL AL. AND AIRCRAFT P-32, WAS SIGHTED. AIR SPACE CONTROL PROCEDURE PRESCRIBE THAT FLIGHT PLAN BE FILED FOP. ALL AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS NOT RADAR TRACKS.

IT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED IF FLIGHT PLAN HAD BEEN FILED. THE REPORT STATE THAT AIRCRAFT WAS OF SUFFICIENT SIZE TO HAVE BEEN SEEN BY WITNESS. LT COL KING, COMMANDING OFFICER OF 63RD AIR DIVISION, AND MAJOR FLINT, OPERATIONS OFFICER OF 63RD AIR DIVISION, STATED THAT THE AIRCRAFT COULD NOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR FROM THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF UPCOMING FLIGHTS. CAPABILITY OF THIS AIRCRAFT REMAINED UNKNOWN AND UNSUBSTANTIATED. PART SEVEN: G. (2) CLAIM: (2) OBJECT WAS OF SUPERIOR MANEUVERABILITY OVER AND ABOVE THAT NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH MANNED AIRCRAFT.

CANNOT BE CONFIRMED NOR ACCEPTABLE FOR ARMY OR AIR FORCE OPERATION. PART EIGHT: (2) OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT: BASED UPON THE PREVIOUS INFORMATION OBTAINED, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT:

1. THE OBJECT OBSERVED APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN AN AIRCRAFT EITHER VISUALLY OR ELECTRONICALLY OBSERVED THROUGH THE OVERCAST WINDOW WHILE LOOKING FOR A  CLOUD FORMATION. THE POSSIBILITY OF REFLECTION IS SINGULARLY POINTED TOWARD THIS EXPLANATION. THE OBJECT EXHIBITING SUPERIOR MANEUVERABILITY CANNOT BE FACTUALLY SUBSTANTIATED AS NOTHING SIMILAR TO THIS HAS OCCURRED BEFORE. THE COLORS TOWARDS FOUR COLOCKS COL KING STATES THAT HE FIRST OBSERVED TWO OBJECTS THROUGH THE OVERHEAD WINDOW WHILE LOOKING FOR A CLOUD FORMATION.

IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS IN FACT AN AIRCRAFT.

TO DETERMINE HOW CLOSE AND 
APPARENT CIRCLES COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SUCH OPTICAL ILLUSION.
COULD NOT SEE OBJECTS FROM THAT SEAT, BUT NAVIGATION LIGHTS ON WING TIPS COULD HAVE CREATED SUCH VISUAL EFFECT.
