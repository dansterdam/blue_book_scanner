11. COMMENTS
Description is characteristic of a ballistic-type observation. Altitude, although given as 20-30 degrees, is estimated and location and time of the observation indicate a probable astronomical phenomena, possibly a meteor. However, the brevity of the observation and lack of details preclude a definitive conclusion that the object was a known stimulus. The case must be listed as Insufficient Data for Evaluation.

Subject: Unidentified flying object

Date: 26 SEP 1960

TO: MAJOR GENE EVANS, ATIC WRIGHT-PATTERSON APB, OHIO

FROM: JOHN A. TRESH, CIVIL AIR PATROL, LAWRENCE & CLACKAMAS FIELD, OREGON

The Civil Air Patrol reported that this object was tracked on radar for about 2 hours. It showed no visible lights or flight characteristics typical of an aircraft. It made sharp turns and high-speed maneuvers that an aircraft could not perform.

The incident is a copy of the article which appeared in the Portland Oregonian September 22, 1960.
