Gentlemen:

On the night of August 12, 1962, about 9:30 P.M., my family and I saw an object which appeared to be about 200 to 300 miles above the surface of the earth. It was round in shape, and gave off a small blue-green light which seemed to disappear at approximately 9:37 P.M. E.D.T. The object was traveling in a south to north direction and left no trail behind it.

This is something like I have seen before, and if you could tell me anything about it, I would appreciate it. Also if this information is of any value to you, I would be glad to give you any additional details that I can recall.

Sincerely yours,
[Redacted]
Danbury, Connecticut

Dear Mr.  ,

We are unable to confirm the sighting you reported as an incidence of an unidentified flying object. Sightings of this nature frequently occur and are difficult to assess accurately. The phenomena mentioned in the inclosure that you describe are indeed quite ordinary and characteristic of the day to day activities in the area.

Fishings of the nature that you encounter are numerous and it is presumed that your sighting was of a similar character. In any case, we are unable to conclude that this instance was of an unusual nature closely attendant to the data contained in the inclosure.  

Thank you for your interest in NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center. 

Sincerely,

James E. Lowry, Jr.
Director of Public Information
