On Wednesday, August 30, 1961, my friend and I reported a moving object in the sky over Brooklyn, New York. It was about 7:35 P.M. when we first noticed the object. It was a brilliant light, larger and brighter than any star in the night sky. The light was approximately 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon, and was traveling in a straight, level path from southwest to northeast. The light was steady and did not blink or flicker. The object was visible for approximately 4 to 5 minutes before it disappeared from sight, traveling at a very high rate of speed.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed letter addressed to the United States Air Force from a person in Brooklyn, New York. The letter describes observing a satellite-like object passing overhead at approximately 9:35 P.M. on July 30, 1961. The writer asks the Air Force to identify which satellite was observed, as the newspapers do not have any information about it. The letter is signed by the writer with their address in Brooklyn, New York.

July 31, 1931

United States Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Gentlemen:

On Sunday, July 30, 1931, my friend and I spotted a moving object in the sky. It was moving in a northeasterly direction. We have already seen the Tyros satellite and we know this was a satellite of some sort. The satellite passed over at approximately 9:35 P.M.

Would you please tell us which satellite we saw? We called the newspapers but they know nothing about it.

Very truly yours,

[Redacted]
Brooklyn 25, New York

We are enclosing a stamped, self-addressed envelope for your convenience.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book, with a drawing space and various questions related to describing the observed object.

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound None
b. Color Like a dull white star

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch the object that you saw, such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show the direction that the object was moving. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

The drawing shows an oval-shaped object with an arrow beside it pointing to the right, indicating the direction of movement.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from what seems to be a Project Blue Book report, containing a series of questions and instructions related to observing and describing an unidentified object.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?
22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or pencil at arm's length with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match stick or pencil. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The image appears to contain two sketches. The larger sketch shows a person standing on a road with mountains and buildings in the background. The smaller sketch shows a person standing in a landscape with a curved horizon line.

Text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
