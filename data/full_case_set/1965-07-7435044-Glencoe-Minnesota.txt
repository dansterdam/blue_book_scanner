Dear Sir,

This letter concerns my sighting and investigation of an unusual object seen on Saturday, 29 May 1965, in the vicinity of Glencoe, Minnesota.

On that date, at approximately 8:50 p.m., I received a call from [redacted], a local resident, reporting that he had sighted an unusual object in the sky. I immediately proceeded to the reported location, arriving within 5 minutes.

Upon arrival, I observed a large, domed, metallic object hovering at an estimated altitude of 500 to 700 feet above the ground. The object was approximately 40 to 50 feet in diameter and had a reddish-orange glow emanating from the underside. After hovering for perhaps 20 seconds, the object suddenly accelerated and climbed at a very rapid rate, disappearing from sight within a few seconds.

I continued to search the area but was unable to locate the object again. There were no other witnesses besides [redacted], who remained on the scene with me until the object had departed.

I am forwarding this report for your information and any further investigation you deem appropriate.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
Commanding Officer

There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, containing handwritten text.

As requested, here is the text from the document produced by an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system:

As the object was moving over head it progressively glowed and became increasingly brighter. I watched it for about 15 minutes. It was so bright that I could see distinctly that it was oval in shape. It appeared to be oscillating or wobbling from side to side as it traveled. At one point it appeared to change directions slightly and then continued on its original course.  
The object was traveling at a very high rate of speed and was heading in a northerly direction. When it was directly overhead it appeared to be about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. After about 15 minutes the object simply disappeared from sight. The sky was clear and there was no cloud cover at the time. I might mention that I have seen other unidentified objects in the past but this was one of the most spectacular that I have ever witnessed. I would appreciate it if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter and let me know if you have any further questions concerning this sighting. 

Sincerely,
[Redacted]
