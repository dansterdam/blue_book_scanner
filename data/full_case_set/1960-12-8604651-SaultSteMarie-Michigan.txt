They observed a very bright white light that appeared to be hovering. The object was in their sight for approximately 1 minute. It appeared to be a half mile to three fourths mile distant and at an altitude of about 1000 feet. The object then accelerated and disappeared.

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
While looking at the night sky, Mr. X noticed a series of four or five white objects move across the sky in a northerly direction. They were flying at a high altitude and were traveling at a rather slow rate of speed. After they had been observed for about 5 minutes they disappeared from sight. Mr. X stated that this object was not an aircraft, and that it did not resemble any known type of conventional aircraft. He was unable to identify the objects.
11. COMMENTS
This report is one of several received by this office describing the sighting of a similar type of white object in this general area during the past several months. Several of the reports have come from reliable observers. However, because of the lack of detailed data for positive identification, the cause of these observations remains unexplained.
