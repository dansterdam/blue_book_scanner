Project 10073R Record Card
1. DATE: 2 November 1957
2. LOCATION: Between Tonopah and Las Vegas, Nevada - Desert
3. DATE-TIME GROUP: 23/1312Z
4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Radar
5. DURATION: 20 minutes
6. SOURCE: Military-Air Force
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 20 minutes
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS: 4 
9. COURSE: Straight
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Four disc-shaped objects observed from a ground radar station. The objects approached Las Vegas at a high rate of speed, when source approached objects they slowly disappeared behind nearby low hills with an almost unnoticeable climb that became completely invisible even when radar continued to track them. Objects reported as resembling targets of opportunity that were neither positively identified.
11. COMMENTS: Considered an optical illusion similar to a mirage, possibly due to wind, heat and dust conditions, half light conditions and flat country with poor horizon cal which makes distinction difficult.

NORMAN, OKLAHOMA

DEAR DR. ROTH:

THIS LETTER HEREWITH SUBMITS A CASE FILE CONTAINING THE ORIGINAL REPORT OF A SIGHTING OF A CIRCULAR OBJECT OVER THE DESERT BETWEEN TONOPAH AND LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, ON THE EVENING OF 25 NOVEMBER 1954.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN YOU AND CAPTAIN GREGORY, THE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER HAS RETAINED CUSTODY OF THE ORIGINAL REPORT AND SUPPORTING DATA, INCLUDING PHOTOS, SINCE IT IS STANDARD PROCEDURE TO SAFEGUARD SUCH MATERIALS AS A PART OF THE FILES OF PROJECT BLUE BOOK. REGARDING THE POSSIBLE USE OF YOUR SERVICES, CERTAIN PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE MATERIAL HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WHICH MAY PROVE TO BE OF SOME INTEREST AND VALUE TO YOU.

THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED SO FAR, BASED UPON A DETAILED PSYCHOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED IF YOU COULD REVIEW THESE DATA AND COMMUNIONS RESULTING FROM YOUR ANALYSIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

WE SHOULD LIKE VERY MUCH TO HAVE YOUR UTILIZATION OF THIS REPORT ON THE BASIS OF YOUR PREVIOUS WORK IN THIS FIELD, IN WHICH YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OR REPORTS ON UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS WOULD BE OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST TO US.

BACKGROUND MATERIAL AND CERTAIN POINTS WHICH MAY BE HELPFUL TO YOUR ANALYSIS AS FOLLOWS:

1. A "LARGE CIRCULAR OR 'SAUCER' AND 'CIGAR-SHAPED' OBJECT," SUCH AS OUR UFO PROGRAM HAS ENCOUNTERED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS SOME TIME AGO, WAS REPORTEDLY OBSERVED BY A USAF PILOT OVER THE DESERT BETWEEN TONOPAH AND LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, ON THE EVENING OF 25 NOVEMBER 1954.

DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT, AS GIVEN BY THE PILOT, GENERALLY INDICATES IT TO BE OF A TYPE WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS "FLYING SAUCER", GENERALLY DISC-LIKE IN SHAPE, WITH A SLIGHT DOME OR PROJECTION ON TOP AND BOTTOM, AND A COLOR VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED AS SILVER, METALLIC, OR WHITE.

ALTHOUGH THE PILOT'S REPORT CONTAINS CERTAIN OBSERVATIONS AND IMPRESSIONS REGARDING THE OBJECT'S PERFORMANCE AND BEHAVIOR WHICH CORRESPOND TO CHARACTERISTICS GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED TO SUCH UNCONVENTIONAL AERIAL OBJECTS, IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO CONTAIN ANY CONCLUSIVE OR UNAMBIGUOUS EVIDENCE WHICH WOULD SERVE TO IDENTIFY THE NATURE OF THE OBJECT.

ORIGINAL REPORT IS ON FILE AT THIS CENTER, AND SUPPORTING DATA INCLUDING PHOTOGRAPHS HAVE BEEN SECURED, THOUGH NOT REVIEWED IN DETAIL AT THIS TIME.

C. In this respect, this case may be considered as significant, inasmuch as elements of the air force are directly involved and implicated. Two separate, and equipuent, projected aircraft and sizable objects were sighted, and evidence of probable close encounter with these objects is provided by official testimony given during interview.

It is requested that this material be handled as discretely as possible, and that the damage to this craft, if any, be considered extremely minor, and with the understanding that this was not likely without rest, with the exception of a brief noise.

It appears to be a typed letter from The Ohio State University addressed to Mr. Howard Cross at Battelle Memorial Institute regarding an incident that occurred on November 23, 1957 near Tonopah, Nevada. The letter discusses the nature of the incident and the possibility of a deliberate hoax, as well as recommendations for further investigation. It also mentions consulting Dr. Ross McFarland, a Harvard University psychologist, regarding the officer's physical and psychological condition during the 72-hour period preceding the reported sighting.

THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
COLUMBUS 10
3 April 1956

Mr. Howard Cross
Battelle Memorial Institute
505 King Avenue
Columbus, Ohio

Dear Mr. Cross,

I have examined the Tonopah, Nevada incident of 23 November 1957, involving Lt. Joseph P. Long.

This is indeed an unusual report. With one important exception, it has many of the characteristics of the deliberate hoaxes and reports of psychologists and psychiatrists and pilots who actually see these sights, made by an Air Force officers, a pilot who took one of the photographs.

On the basis of the evidence in the folder I can only offer conjectures regarding the nature of this incident. These conjectures may be helpful, however, in the collection of additional evidence.

First, there is always the possibility of a deliberate hoax, even in an Air Force officer. To check on this possibility, I would recommend a discreet investigation of the officer's personal background -- the kind of investigation that is conducted before granting a security clearance. Specifically, do friends, neighbors, etc. know of any evidence in the officer's background that would suggest the possibility of hoax or hallucination?

Second, and what I consider the most likely conjecture, it is possible that the officer was suffering from a temporary condition such as fatigue or trance induced hypnosis on the occasion. Research on truck drivers, for example, who have driven off the road in order to avoid (entirely imagined) houses, bushes, etc., ahead of them on the desert roads, especially at night. This is most likely to occur on long desert roads, especially at night.

I suggest Dr. Ross McFarland, School of Public Health, Harvard University should be consulted on this point. He has made studies of road hypnosis. (He has also served with an Air Force Scientific Advisory Board study group and is an authority in aviation psychology.)

I recommend that a complete hour-by-hour analysis be made of Lt. Long's activities during the 72-hour period preceding the reported sighting. Was he subjected to unusual physical or psychological stresses during the latter phases of the survival course? Exactly how much sleep had he had during this 72-hour period? If he had been taking any drugs, stimulants or alcohol during the night's drive. If so, what and how much?

Mr. Howard Cross - page UNCLASSIFIED
3 April 1956

(Note: This investigation should be made through an interview with Lt. Long by a competent Flight Surgeon, and by means of a check-up with Survival Course personnel at stand at Las Banos.)

Third, there is a possibility that this may conform to the pattern of many previous flying saucer reports. As I pointed out some nine years ago in my first analysis, practically all reports are characterized by complete lack of observation of specific details of the object observed. (Note that here the object itself is never clearly seen it appears to be the mist and bright glare of its own luminous components (the "translucent glow") as well as the "hemispherical" handing gear for the object which were without definite structure. This appearance of roundness, lack of clear corners, edges, structural detail, etc., may have actually become the object is seen rarely as clearly as in a moonlit night when the edge outline becomes distinguishable. As this object moved, I am satisfied that he saw direct light source, or else his eyes are out of focus, or else the object is much further away than assumed. Lt. Long's account is clearly inconsistent with his statement that he was within 50 feet of the object. At 50 feet one should have been able to observe all structural details, such as antennae, radar masts and so forth.

If conditions should be true, I cannot speculate as to what was actually seen. However, I do recommend that a thorough check be made for possible meteors or other natural activities in the area.

I am at a loss to account for the high intensity noise together with absence of dust, smoke, or dust effects. It may be conjecture here is that the objects may have been much farther away than assumed. Sound travels to others to judge the impotence of this evidence.

As to the "several small impressions" in the sand I shall leave it to others to judge the importance of this evidence.

In summary, I strongly feel that this is just another case of mistaken identity or confusion in perception under unusual circumstances. This opinion must, of course, is based primarily on considerations that I have pointed out before from a scientific viewpoint, it is impossible to disprove in each case that the thing observed was not a vehicle from other space - it is not passing to prove the null hypothesis. However, in view of the now widespread and cumulative amount of negative data, my own inclination is to discount this and similar reports as having no remaining substance as evidence of an immediate presence.

Sincerely,
Paul M. Fitts

TO: District Commander
Fifth District Office of Special Investigations
ATTN: Major M. M. Rola
Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

1. In accordance with prescribed directives of AFR 200-2, this Center has conducted an extensive investigation and analysis of a UFO incident that occurred near Tonopah, Nevada, in the early morning of 23 November 1957. (Uncl)

2. In brief, the incident involves a subject officer who claims to have made close contact with what in connected observation has been requested by this Center disclosed that subject officer left immediately upon completing the USAF Survival School at Stead AFB. Neveda and all flight routes to Las Vegas, and encountered the alleged objects the following day. USAF Survival School students normally encounter numerous strange phenomena and objects during their training that are familiar with both current and projected aircraft, missile and helicopter designs, as well as aerial phenomena that is often unfamiliar or unconventional airborne objects, yet insisting in official testimony (Conf)

3. The matter has been completed within this Center's scope of responsibility, which embraces only the technical and scientific study and analyses of the incident. As such, it has not been resolved to full satisfaction of the Air Force, this is currently being pursued jointly by a Review Board established at the Ohio State University, to which the case was referred for their review and evaluation. Herewith is attached case file. Dr. Pitts has performed analyses, from the psychological point of view, the number of complete UFO cases for the Air Force. (Conf)

4. The case is now considered to fall within the requirements for a special investigation, if it is to be carried to its ultimate and logical conclusion. It is therefore requested that action be initiated to accomplish the following: (Restricted)

a. A discreet investigation of the officer's background, with emphasis on leads and indications that would suggest any tendency towards exaggerations or possibility of a hoax.

b. An hour-by-hour accountability of the 72 hour period preceding the alleged sighting, with full consideration given to those points specifically mentioned in Dr. Hynek's report.

c. Contact and coordination with both the Flight Surgeon and pertinent authorities of the Survival School, to determine the nature of the course, its possible effects on trainees, and any information regarding unusual physical conditions, performance and including his physical and mental condition during and at the completion of this rigid course.

d. This matter is considered urgent for the manifold reasons found in the attached case file, and particularly if this officer completes his tour of duty, or otherwise severs his relations with the Air Force prior investigations to determine the actual facts have been completed.

MEMORANDUM FOR Colonel Eriksen, AFCIN-4-Xl
Mr. Archer
SUBJECT: Special Investigation - 1st Lt J. F. Long, AO-392864O

1. I do not feel that the proposed OSI investigation is necessary for the following reasons:
a. If the OSI determines that the subject's background does not suggest any tendencies toward exaggerations or hoaxes, our present conclusions regarding the sightings are neither strengthened nor weakened.
b. If the OSI determines that the subject's background does contain indications that would suggest a definite tendency toward exaggerations or hoaxes, ATIC is then bound to take some follow-up action. Such action would be detrimental to the individual concerned, and would not positively disprove the alleged sighting.

The final paragraph of the report by Dr. Fitts seems to me to be an entirely acceptable conclusion in regard to this case. I recommend that this conclusion be accepted and that the case be closed.

The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document containing a report on a UFO incident that occurred between Tonopah and Las Vegas, Nevada on November 23, 1957.

The text in the document reads as follows:

MEMORANDUM FOR FILE:
SUBJECT: Final Disposition - UFO Incident, Tonopah, Nevada, 23 Nov 57.

1. PURPOSE: This memorandum was prepared to summarize the details of the background and events of subject incident; and to provide an official record of the developments leading to the "closing" of this case.

2. GENERAL BACKGROUND AND PERTINENT EVENTS:
   a. First report of incident was received by ATIC by priority (Flash) message 517-57, 6-57-0317/55. Telephone request made to Headquarters ATIC for a "full-scale investigation because of the unusual aspects and phenomena."
   b. Results of ATIC investigation received 22 January 1958 on Air Intelligence Information Report - UFOUB-779-57, Detachment 10, 1005th AISS.
   c. Careful review and analysis of all information and data from investigative reports resulted in advisability* and/or hypotheses:
      (1) Optical illusion/Mistaken Identity:
         Source was extremely fatigued; had just completed one of the most difficult courses with its known physical and mental demands; observed phenomena at a location, time and under conditions known to produce optical illusions and mirage-like conventions of strange things and phenomena for unusual objects; flat desert country, had the appearance of distance and vastness that could be very deceptive to the contrary notwithstanding. (Interrogations conducted always state that they felt they saw a wide awake - not in an impaired physical condition. Under no circumstances will they admit otherwise.)
      (2) A deliberate hoax/justification for considering this hypothesis is supported by the following facts, based on the investigations and substantiated interrogations:
         (a) Incident happened only a few days after the now-famous "Levelland UFO Chase" which attracted over 400 almost similarly described UFO reports in three states.

- page 19 -

There is no photograph present in this document. The document appears to be text from a Project Blue Book report or investigation.

TRANSCRIBED TEXT:

Except for the "contact" aspects, Lt Ione's description is not confirmative of the incident. Parallels Levelland, Texas case insofar as unusual antics, stops, hears high-pitched whine, notices objects emit a luminous glow.

Familiar with science fiction, "flying saucer" and "UFO" write-ups. 

Mouthed same thread-worn statements used by majority of pseudo-scientists and "flying saucer" authors. Accounts of this earth circuit - believe they were such ships.

Background checks disclosed source:
(1) His extensive officer - with probability of release upon termination of his current tour.
(2) His academic training, and education was to prepare him for TV and related work. 
(3) Opportunity this story would create in TV and press. See "Analyst's comments" in case file regarding positive motives for story, which includes:

Actual "unknown" Crafts: Although it cannot be conclusively proved that this craft charter existed, the following tend to indicate otherwise:
(a) Checks indicated orientation or any unusual reported from any U.S. radar units that scan the air space.
(b) Height check indicates the low, solid objects could traversed U.S. air space without being picked up on significant radar capabilities
(c) No reports of any unusual from military and civil flights, operations, and other activities in the area.

No reports from any persons or drivers in that area and controls State Highway Department which stated that there is always some traffic on U.S. Highway 95 and 6 where the incident took place) and that no one reported anything unusual from either that specific location or Arizona that day.

There does not appear to be any photograph present in this document. The document appears to be a psychological analysis of an incident, with text describing the analysis and recommendations.

Here is the text from the document:

a. Psychological Analysis of Incident:
(1) Undersigned officer considered it to the best interests of all concerned to have the entire incident, and the details of the psychological examination, analyzed and evaluated from a psychological point of view - before making any definite conclusions or recommending further actions.
(2) A visually psychological examination of the source, concurrent with his report was not considered advisable.
(3) Dr. Paul M. Fitts, Department of Psychology, United States University, was consulted and the case was turned over to him for psychological analysis and recommendations.
(4) Dr. Fitts was selected for this review on the basis of his previous experience with UFO cases, having previously performed psychological studies for the Air Force.
(5) Summary of Dr. Fitts' Comments and Recommendations:
(a) The report has many of the characteristics of details that are psychologically considered suspect.
(b) There is complete lack of observation of specific details - although observer states he was very close to objects, and inconsistent with his statement, his description was very general.
(c) Most likely conjecture: road hypnosis due to excessive fatigue and loss of sleep by the witness seeing objects ahead of them. (Many well documented cases, and is most likely to occur on long desert roads).
(d) Conclusions: Mistaken identity or confusion in perception; present evidence not considered conclusive) of the actual incident.
(e) Recommendations: An hour-by-hour investigation and analysis of Lt. Long's activities during the 72-hour period preceding the reported sighting.

3. RECOMMENDED COURSES OF ACTION, AND POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF EACH:
Upon review of Dr. Fitts' report the following courses of action were considered, along with their possible consequences. It is recommended that the case be reviewed by Centreal Intelligence Agency, Project Blue Book Staff, or Headquarters USAF for a command decision:

UNCLASSIFIED
Case 7, No. 15. Project 10073 Record Card Consequences: test would definitely establish if subject was lying, or was opposed to the release of information the Air Force was desirous to have the three strange objects (because of fatigue, road imprints, etc.) the case would remain unclassified. No indication at this time the objects would remain unidentified.
b. Close the case with the stronger of the two hypothesis advanced (dependence) dismissed. The sightings must be considered as unexplained due to insufficient data on the part of subject.
Consequences: Future sighteings of similar nature would be ignored and would not consider the Air Force's interest in the situation, lack of adequate data to determine the reason for not following-up the sightingon(s).
3. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION of Lt Long's actions, whereabouts, credentials, and physical and mental condition and other data gleaned for the period preceding his sighting to provide the basis with further facts or confirming information necessary to form adequate conclusion. If investigation reveals no conclusive evidence, the Air Force would probably accept the findings, and the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center's deliberate attempts to exaggerate or publicity seeking for personal gain at later date would limit mutual relations, and any future acceptance of reports from this subject would be extremely guarded, with as an example of "UFO Clubs" desiring to exploit the situation.
4. SUMMARY OF INCIDENT FOR GENERAL WATSON AND DECISION:
a. Detailed Summarization of Case: Brief summary of the case was requested by Mr. Arcier to be submitted to General Watson for review and for consideration. 
b. Summary viewed by Col Erikson, Deputy Commander, who received the investigation report and his concurrence.
c. Approved by Gen. WATSON for final action. Investigation requested by Mr. Arcier.
5. FINAL ACTION AND DISPOSITION:
a. Final letter to OSI for full-scale investigation submitted through channels for coordination and final approval on 21 April 1953.
b. Non-concurrence to proposed OSI action with memorandum to Col Erikson outlining reasons for the nonconcurrence, with recommendation that case be closed.

The text in the document is as follows:

SUMMARY OF TONOPAH, NEVADA UFO INCIDENT FOR GENERAL MASON

Priority report received on 24 November 1957 that an Air Force pilot had encountered four (4) so-called "flying saucers" early in the morning or 26 November 1957. West of Tonopah, Nevada, he observed it closely; in fact, approached within 50 feet of the object before it disappeared.

Numerous UFO reports from pilots and aircrews during the last ten (10) years have observed in the air, this no instance knows of any "contacts" by otherwise qualified military personnel. Headquarters ATC was requested to make immediate full-dress investigation, and reports to ATIC in detail.

3. A review and evaluation of this report indicated the following:

a. Officer had a background and studies in Speech, and related subjects for TV work.
b. Was familiar with names of well-known science-fiction and "flying saucer" writers.
c. Advanced the same classic arguments of "saucer" believers that objects were space ships, 1.e., did not resemble any known military or civilian aircraft.
d. He is a reserve officer, with the possibility that he may complete his tour of duty with the Air Force in the very near future, and would probably enter into TV work.
e. He just completed the very rigid USAF Survival Course at Stead AFB the day before, last immediately, and drove all night enroute to Las Vegas.

4. Checks during no ICBM or other unusual objects from radar, GCI, military and civil flight and other operations from that area. No reports from any other persons in that locality.

5. ATIC evaluation: (A) Probably mistook conventional objects because of fatigue from driving all night and the mental strain from the recent completion of survival course, coupled with his imagination of well-known "saucer' writers; or (B) a deliberate hoax.

6. In either event, the conclusions were considered satisfactory. 
7. The case file data was submitted to a well-known psychologist who had previously studied UFO sightings. His comments paralleled those of ATIC, but with recommendations that the officer be discreetly investigated further with a view of obtaining certain pertinent information to resolve the case.
8. The damage and embarrassment to the Air Force would be incalculable, if, this officer allied himself with the host of "flying saucer" writers, experts, and others who berate the Air Force with stand, the Air Force would have no effective rebuttal, or evidence to disprove any unfounded charges.

Address: 321st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, ADC
Las Vegas, Nevada

DETAILS: SOURCE will be at above address after 15 January 58. He is presently on special temporary duty at Stead AFB, Washoe County Airport, Wilmington, Del., where his former unit, the 29th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, ADC, was inactivated.

Age: 24
Occupation: 1ST LT, USAF, INTERCEPTOR PILOT

Education: GRADUATES OF HIGHSCHOOL-ACCEPTED FOR PILOT TRAINING. SIX MONTHS ADVANCED INSTRUMENT SCHOOL. FLYING QUALIFICATIONS INCLUDE INSTRUMENT SCHOOL, FLYING TRAINING, QUALIFIIED IN F-94 AND F-89.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: CONSCIENTIOUS, INTELLIGENT, AND HE WAS FRIENDLY AND COOPERATIVE. AT FIRST HIS RESPONSES APPEARED SOMEWHAT NERVOUS, BUT IT IS BELIEVED HIS NERVOUSNESS WAS DUE TO THE INFORMATION WHICH HE DISCUSSED AND HIS APPARENT EARNESTNESS IN RELATING IT ACCURATELY. HIS RESPONSES INDICATED NO ATTEMPT TO EXAGGEATE AND HE PRESENTED FACTS TO HIS BEST KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF.

III. CIRCUMSTANCES OF SIGHTING - SOURCE WAS RETURNING TO NEWCASTLE, WYOMING, ON APRIL 29, 1957 IN HIS AUTOMOBILE. AT ABOUT 8:30 P.M. HE WAS NEAR TONOPAH, NEVADA, ON U.S. HIGHWAY 95, ABOUT 10 MILES WEST OF LAS VEGAS. SUDDENLY HE OBSERVED TWO OBJECTS WHICH APPEARED TO BE IN MOTION NEAR THE GROUND IN THE DISTANCE. THE OBJECTS APPEARED TO BE AN UNUSUAL SHAPE, DISC-LIKE WITH RED LIGHTS ON THE UNDERSIDE, AND WERE MOVING IN A NORTH-SOUTH DIRECTION IN RELATION TO HIS POSITION. SOURCE SAYS HE SLOWED HIS CAR TO OBSERVE THE OBJECTS, WHICH PASSED OVER HIS CAR IN A NORTH-SOUTH DIRECTION AND DISAPPEARED TO THE NORTH. DURING THE LATTER PART OF THIS TIME WHEN THE OBJECTS WERE DIRECTLY OVERHEAD, HIS AUTOMOBILE RADIO STOPPED FUNCTIONING. LATER, WHEN THE OBJECTS WERE NO LONGER VISIBLE, HIS RADIO AGAIN BEGAN FUNCTIONING NORMALLY.

REPORT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
DE-EACH: Nov 10, 1606th AISS

That appeared hemispherical in shape, about two (2) feet in diameter was observed by the observer from his vehicle while traveling along the highway (U.S. 95) to the top of the dome to be about ten (10) to fifteen (15) feet in diameter. The object appeared to be solid, and there was no evidence which would indicate it was transparent. The object was observed within fifty (50) feet of the nearest object, the hum, which had been studied shortly before by the observer. The object remained stationary for a period of about one and one-half (1 1/2) minutes, then accelerated at a very rapid rate of speed and disappeared behind those hills. As the object departed, the observer noted the absence of any sound or vibration.

There was no odor or smoke or any other outward signs or indications on the bottom of the object of any kind of propulsion system. The object appeared to be solid, smooth and well-defined, with no indications of landing gear or any other external fittings or appendages. There was no evidence that any heat had been present, and the ground in the area showed no signs of disturbance.

The investigation of the impressions SOURCE returned to his car, obtaining telephonic reports from other witnesses who had also observed the object, and who substantiated the same general descriptions, i.e. smooth, solid, hemispherical, and well-defined in appearance. SOURCE advises that in his opinion the object had no visible means of propulsion, and that it maneuvered in a manner not characteristic of any known aircraft, and was unlike any aerial device with which he is familiar. SOURCE stated that the object made no sound, nor was there any trail or exhaust of any kind visible. SOURCE had no other information to add before terminating his involvement with the incident.

The time of day referred to above was given in Pacific Standard time. The sun was still behind the horizon, and there was no moonlight. There was no over-cast. The weather was dry, rather cold, and there was little or no wind. There was no observation to the best of the witnesses' knowledge, of the object's arrival or departure, other than its sudden appearance and disappearance.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: 
1. According to the analysis, the sighting was witnessed under weather conditions and the circumstances surrounding the sighting were well as the physical phenomena involved. SOURCES concluded that the sighting was credible that the exact technical nature of the phenomena involved might raise some doubt. It is deemed that the general characteristics and their behavior exhibited indicate a high degree of intelligence. other forms of intelligence exist, and that they may be well advanced in mechanisms beyond our present technological knowledge. In this is included the anomalous behavior manifested in the aerial vehicle(s) observed on 19 October 1956 at this location which could not have been any of the following - aerial vehicles, dirigibles, balloons, aircraft, helicopters, missiles, etc., because the size and the maneuvers clearly indicated that they were of a technical sophistication not attainable with any craft known to U.S. aeronautical technology at that time. 
2. SOURCES concluded the objects were experimental models of some type, and were apparently the result of a propulsion system and control methods utilizing principles yet undiscovered by contemporary U.S. aeronautical engineering. This was indicated by the performance observed and the speed and maneuverability so far beyond the capability of any aerospace vehicles known at that time.
3. SOURCES also concluded that attempts by any country to conceal any technological advance would probably be directed toward obscuring or diverting attention from their true nature and capabilities for obvious security reasons.
4. The SOURCES did not believe that the objects were from foreign sources, because weather balloons and other natural phenomena can be ruled out on the basis of the observed characteristics and behavior.
5. SOURCES stated that the only physical evidence other than the sighting itself, which could have substantiated the observations, would have been photographic or telemetric data, had it been obtained; but regrettably, no such data was available. 
6. The SOURCES have assigned a high RELIABILITY CONFIDENCE FACTOR to this analysis, based on the factors outlined above.

REPORT NO. 115-CUSOB-779-57 PAGE 11 OF 12 PAGES
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
The officer considering the excellent weather conditions and the circumstances surrounding the sighting, believes that the objects observed could have been either blimps, balloons or aircraft. He concludes from the facts that he considers verified that the opinion expressed by the sender of the original report of the appearance of the objects as like a strange or unidentified object or an unusual maneuver, is possible but considers it less likely.
The officer states that they could not have been any known or common type because he saw the objects clearly and is familiar with airframes of this type.
However, he did not believe that they were U.S. experimental models because he considered that the lights were of some duration and in an uncontrolled area, such as the vicinity in which the incident took place.
The officer rules out the possibility that the objects belonged to a foreign nation because he considers that the objects were probably not sophisticated enough for a foreign power to have been able to get into the area and conduct a maneuver and could have landed just as easily at a spot not visible from the road.
SOURCES ruled out the possibility that the objects were manifestations of natural or atmospheric phenomena, such as a mirage or lenticular clouds, because the sighting occurred during daylight hours and the objects were sighted over an extended period of time.
SOURCES did not believe that the objects were frank reflections in the desert sand because the objects were clearly visible in the air.
SOURCES ruled out misinterpretation or other weather phenomena because the objects were clearly visible and consistent throughout the sighting.
SOURCES stated that the only physical evidence other than the initial sighting itself was the fact that the objects caused radio interference which might have been due to electromagnetic forces which might have been produced. He assumed that this was the cause of propagation for the objects, "these alone never seen so believe that they were space ships, because we would have some hint if we were able to do such a thing."
(A certain amount of hesitancy, on the part of SOURCES could be detected by the interviewing officer, to conclude anything revolutionary as this for so many years.)

SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
Agencies such as flight service centers, air traffic control centers, weather stations, astronomical observatories, etc., will be notified as required to assist in the collection and reporting of information. Any pertinent data will be forwarded to the project as received.

The type of object was investigated and initial observations indicate that the progress of this report can not be satisfactorily established at this time. It is felt that any test experimental or other type of vehicle of unconventional appearance may have been observed. Attempts have been made to locate any possible witnesses, but so far no first-hand observers have been found.

The investigation is being continued in an effort to obtain additional information that may serve to clarify the nature of this incident.

Analyst's Comments Regarding Possible Reasons For Source Manufacturing:
1. Officer has reserve status. Will be eligible for discharge in future.
2. His academic training and education appears to be speech, dramatics, etc. For TV work.
3. It is assumed that upon completion of his prescribed "Reserve Tour" he will associate himself with TV work - either as a writer, editor, commentator etc.
4. If he has kept his thumb on TV's pulse, he knows the great public interest in "flying saucers" and "UFOs" - and the number of TV presentations on this subject.
5. Interrogation brought out that he is familiar with names of prominent authors and schemes of action which they have given on panel 11 as earth-made vehicles. The arguments given by a number of these authors regarding "flying saucers" or their attempts to prove that they are not earth-made vehicles.
6. Source is therefore not considered to be unaware of the lucrative opportunity and the sensational interest in his suddenly appearing on a TV presentation as a commentator (as is Kenneth Arnold), as a writer of a "flying saucer" eye-witness first person story, or as a guest lecturer or other TV program. He cannot lose: whether civilian or military he is qualified to speak on the only qualified observer, an Air Force pilot, to have seen and made an actual near contact with flying saucers - a "recently experienced up close" etc.
7. Therefore there may be other motives for source manufacturing such a story on the details of the above known facts; this is one motive that cannot be disregarded. Investigator lacks a cardinal rule in handling this case (see page 10, of IR) although the great length and pain to interrogate source and obtain detailed statements and opinions, not a single check was made on local facilities to determine if any aircraft was reported or observed in that area at that time by any person other than the source. This omission is now attributed by me for your consideration.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, containing text describing a request for psychological analysis of a UFO sighting incident.

The text reads as follows:

REQUEST FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS - UFO

SUBJECT: Mr. Waiters
AFCIN-43

It is requested that a review and analysis be made from the psychological point of view of the incident involving Mr. Waiters as a witness of a UFO sighting as reported in the enclosed file of Project BLUE BOOK, and a report of the results be forwarded to this office.

1. It is strongly recommended that Dr. Carl V. Hittie, Department of the Air Force, who has already conducted a review and analysis of other similar cases, be assigned this task. Dr. Hittie has wide experience in this particular field, having performed psychological analyses on other UFO sightings as a consulting psychologist to Project BLUE BOOK.

2. It is recommended that the interview with your witness be conducted as soon as possible. The information normally discussed between your office and a witness to a UFO sighting is essential to Dr. Hittie's analysis. It is anticipated that the information obtained can be transmitted to Project BLUE BOOK during the current funds to Columbus, Ohio.

3. Funding for the proposed consultation services shall be obtained from Project BLUE BOOK, and it is anticipated that the services will exceed eight hours of work.

5. The matter will require discreet handling. The fact that an Air Force pilot insisting and officially testifying that he walked up and talked to an occupant of a flying saucer could not only result in immediate and violent repercussions to this witness, but also have a very detrimental effect on the confidence and respect towards the Air Force. It is, therefore, deemed essential that the Air Force has yet to prove that these alleged incidents are without substantial foundation, as this matter could undoubtedly result in immense and violent representations to the authorities of the air Force. It is for this reason that all Avenue and suspects be explored before such drastic measures as a "witch-hunt" consideration.

1. Request that a review and analysis, from the psychological point of view, be made of UFO data and evaluation associated therewith. It is desired that this be accomplished through the established facilities of Project White Stork, and a report of the results be forwarded to this office as expeditiously as possible.

2. It is strongly recommended that Dr. Paul M. Fitts, Department of Psychology of Ohio State University, perform the required review and analysis. Mr. Fitts made a very fine contribution on this particular project, and having performed our analysis, is well acquainted with the background and requirements of this report on the subject for the Air Force.

3. For the sake of expediency, and in accordance with your suggestions informally indicated between your office and this office, it is recommended that the necessary arrangements be made to expedite this work during the courier runs to Columbus, Ohio.

4. Funding for the proposed consultation services shall be obtained from the AFCIN-43c and is not contemplated that the contract services will exceed $500.00.

5. The matter will require discreet handling.
