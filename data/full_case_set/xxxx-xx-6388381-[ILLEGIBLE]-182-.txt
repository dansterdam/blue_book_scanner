The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed text document describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) incident that occurred on October 17, 1944 in present city, California.

The text reads:

Incident #2907, A. B. C. -- present City, California -- 17 October 1944

This incident has no astronomical explanation. 

Although the four observers had no technical training, their reports are remarkably consistent. The object was in sight several minutes, too long to be a meteor; it made a banking turn of 45Â° and appeared to reflect sunlight very strongly. The speed was great but not excessive.

The object seen could have been an advertising balloon, a balloon, or an aircraft. The banking turn appears to rule out the balloon, unless this was a suggestive impression caused by the turning of the balloon in the wind.

ATTN: MCIAIO-3  

1. Your letter from your Headquarters, MCIAIO, dated 1 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects", has reference. The incidents summarized through 233 have been checked against previous evaluations made by the Air Force. Reports and further information on these incidents are inclosed.  

2. It is recognized that the "Guides to Identification of Discernible Objects in the Night Sky" issued as an "Air Intelligence Information Sheet" is an excellent aid, but it does not appear to cover all characteristics and motions which are distinguished by possible and impossible, and in that motion is signified no more than relative change in apparent position, it would seem that any motion is possible. A radar set indication of any "unidentified flying object" should include a statement as to the type of
radar set used.

Incident: 2CCD

At about 1610, 17 Oct 1948 Mr. [ILLEGIBLE] observed a small silver colored object appearing above the trees. It was preceded in a southerly direction by a greenish flash of light. The object remained in view for about 1.5 seconds, traveling at an estimated speed between 20 and 25,000 feet. The object made a 15-20 degree turn and then appeared to speed up. As the object reached the sun, its outline became very sharp, at which time the sun hit it topside, the object then made a sharp turn to the south and gradually disappeared.

The subject is about 17 years of age, of good character and reputation. He is considered reliable.

Incident: 2000
While conversing with Mr. [REDACTED] on Battery Point, Crescent City, California, a household object that reflected light was observed. The object was elliptic in shape and was traveling southeast to northwest at a high rate of speed. It remained in sight for several seconds and then made a sharp turn and proceeded in a plane flying north. Shortly after sighting, the object made a sharp turn to the right and then assumed a horizontal course, disappearing from view. The object gave no noise or sound and was heard from the object. At all times the object remained brilliantly illuminated.
Mrs. [REDACTED], 70 years of age, of Swiss extraction, and is a long-time resident of Crescent City. She is of nervous intelligen ce and has a good character and reputation. She had no fear of speed, noise or altitude. She thought the object different than any other object she had ever seen. The brightness of the object impressed her most.

At about 1610, 17 October, 1948 while conversing with Mr. Ernest Haley on Battery Point, Crescent City, Cal., I saw a small silver colored object that reflected light as light against a mirror, this object was elliptic in shape and traveling very fast in a southerly direction, and remained in sight for about two (2) minutes, another plane was in sight at the same time heading north, the silver colored object was about 5,000 feet higher than the plane flying north.

Shortly after sighting, the plane or object made a sharp bank of about 45 to the right then resumed her course, disappearing to say, no smoke or noise was heard from the object, at all times the object gave off a brilliant flash as from the sun shining on a glass mirror.

The text in the document is as follows:

At about 1810, 17 October, 1948 while at Crescent City Light Station my attention was attracted by the sound of a plane, looking up I saw a silver colored egg shaped object that had the appearance of a small plane traveling south at about 300 miles an hour. No wings or tail structure was visible, no smoke was visible or any noise heard from it. The plane that attracted my attention prior to seeing the silver colored object was a small piper cub type plane. I only glanced up at the object and did not watch to see where it went.

JAN 7 1949

TO: Chief of Naval Operations
Navy Department
Washington 25, D.C. 

This command is responsible for investigation of all reported incidents of unconventional aerial objects, commonly referred to as "flying at saucers".

Several incidents listed as "objects" in the past have been identifiable as conventional aircraft, balloons, astronomical phenomena, etc. It is possible that some of these reports may have been caused by the recent extensive publicity given to "flying saucers", which might have caused some individuals to report objects with more enthusiasm than objectivity. 

ANY ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS INFORMATION AND SUGGESTIONS
ARE REQUESTED.

Incident No. 166 -- 16 Oct. 1948, 1145 Hours, eight miles east of Capitol, Utah:
The observer saw an object hovering at 6000 ft. heard a throbbing noise, then saw the object descend rapidly and six lights were seen horizontally as 200 MPH. The object was black with revolving lights approximately five to six feet in diameter. The observer's ability to estimate distances was poor.

Incident ^393 -- near Sterling, Utah -- 16 October 1948

There is nothing astronomical in this incident.

It should be pointed out that, since the object was in sight just a few seconds, even a conventional aircraft under power probably would not have allowed much more detailed observation. Probably the distance is grossly underestimated.

16 OCT 45

With the exceptions since this original document has been reviewed, a study has been made of the evidence that was accumulated and of the conclusions reached. The evidence indicates that the object was not of extraterrestrial origin but was of earthly origin. The conclusions that were reached are briefly as follows:

1. The object was circular in shape and was seen to maneuver at a high rate of speed.

2. It is not possible to determine the exact size of the object from the evidence available. However, certain psychological factors indicate that the object was smaller than would be expected for an extraterrestrial vehicle.

3. All of the individuals who observed the object were pilots who were in a position to make accurate observations. Their descriptions are consistent and indicate that the object was a real physical phenomenon.

IV. THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS

The analysis of the eyewitness accounts (see Appendix A) indicates the following:

1. The descriptions of the object given by the witnesses are consistent and indicate that they observed a real physical phenomenon.

2. The object was maneuverable and was observed to change direction and speed in a manner which would be impossible for a conventional aircraft.

3. The object was observed by several witnesses simultaneously, which tends to confirm the existence of the object and eliminate the possibility of a hoax or hallucination.

4. In the opinion of the psychologist who analyzed the witness statements, the descriptions are not consistent with a misidentification of a known object. The psychological factors involved indicate that the witnesses did in fact observe an unidentified flying object.

It is the following conclusion of this investigation:

Based on the scientific analysis of the eyewitness accounts, it is concluded that the object observed was a real physical phenomenon and was not a misidentification of a known object. However, the evidence does not indicate that the object was of extraterrestrial origin.
