SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object
LOCATION: 44N 49W (Atlantic Ocean)
TIME: 1623Z
OBSERVED BY: Crew of MSTS Ship Pvt. Joe E. Mann
DESCRIPTION: An unidentified object was observed on the ship's radar screen. The object was first detected at a range of approximately 100 miles and closing rapidly on the ship's position. The object was only visible on the radar scope and did not appear to have any running lights or other aircraft identification markings. The object passed over the ship at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet and a speed of approximately 3,000 mph. The object was then observed to accelerate and disappear from the radar screen.
CONCLUSION: The object is considered to be an unidentified aerial phenomenon. No logical explanation for the observed object could be determined based on the information available.

SUBJECT: Evaluation of UFO Report from Dow AFB, Maine

TO: TDEW (Lt Col Friend)

1. There are two targets visible on the scope, two of them following identical tracks at a varying angle at constant speed. All these tracks are traveling at the same speed - 1400 mph.
2. It would appear that visual lighting of at least one target would be made (at 'noon') since all targets come within 2 miles.
3. Since the "targets" were not seen visually or on any other means (radar or similar), it cannot be considered as visual sighting as well as radar observation.
4. Since only range and azimuth data was submitted. The range on the scope was not indicated but is assumed to be between 5 and 25 miles on the scope. Altitude data was not submitted. The range is said to be between 5 and 25 miles, which would be approximately 3 to 15 miles actual distance, as well as radar operation.

IF FIELDS
Drinking Increases Serious Thoughts
SOCIAL DRINKING increases among those doing detailed mental tasks, according to a report presented at the annual meeting of the Eastern Psychological Association in New York.
Research on the effects of social drinking has been going on for some time. A new study announced at the meeting suggests that drinking alcohol makes people think about love, sex, and romance
more than those who are not drinking.
Unlike the soft beverage drinkers, il was found, those consuming liquor become more immersed in their own thoughts and inner-directed, rather than observing what they wanted, or wanting to do what they observed.
The psychologists said that this tendency results from the nature of alcohol itself, which, when taken in moderate amounts, relaxes certain areas of the brain that normally inhibit imagination, fancy and rumination. Seliie, D., David C. McClelland, social psychologists at Harvard University and Boston University, reported the study of the effect of social drinking on fraternity members. They found that members who drank as an average of 1.06 alcoholic drinks in a 2-hour period became more preoccupied with romantic and personal concerns than those who did not drink at all.
The general effects of social drinking on various kinds of behavior show that although alcohol initially acts as a stimulant, making the drinker feel more sociable and freer in expressing impulses and physical coordination, it eventually becomes a depressant, impairing such important functions as reasoning and judgment.
ANTHROPOLOGICAL NEWS
Menstrual Reversal By Pregnancy Cravings
IT IS ESTIMATED a many women in Lascars, Ceylon, but in the United States as well. show a tendency to reverse the normal pattern of their menstrual cycles during pregnancy by missing their usual periodS and experiencing intense sexual cravings, Dr. G. Cherneskey, University of Columbia, New York, told the annual conference of the American Anthropological Association in Washington, D. C.
In Lascars, it is a sin for a woman to miss her monthly menstrual period, but the women reveal cravings for various foods, such as pickles, or unusual foods they have never liked before.
The anthropologist says that some Ameriean women may hold this same social taboo, and that their pregnancy cravings represent a return to the man's world once in childhood before the onset of menstruation, when they were free from the restrictions society places on adult women. The deeper meaning of the reversal is not yet fully explained.

MEDICINE
Harmless Heart Murmurs Common in Children
A HARMLESS heart murmur has been found in 25% to 50% of all children because of temporary variation in blood flow through the heart.
As a result, an estimated 3 million American schoolchildren have what is known as a "functional" or "innocent" heart murmur, Dr. Joseph Gralnick of Philadelphia told a Hahnemann Symposium. 
These murmurs can be heard with a stethoscope at the bedside, without recourse to any diagnostic procedures. The murmur disappears as the child matures, Gralnick said.
Extensive clinical and laboratory studies have shown that such murmurs have no significance and require no special treatment or limitation of activity, Gralnick reported.

BUREAU of Mines Reports
on Causes of Flames
 STUDIES of the fundamental processes involved in the ignition of various mine atmospheres and their interpretation by the Bureau of Mines show that the most common causes of underground mine fires and explosions are improper use of explosives, faulty electrical wiring, poor ventilation, and improper use of acetylene torches.
These factors, in a number of years' recording and analyzing mine accident reports, have been found to be the major causes of mine fires and explosions in which a flammable or explosive atmosphere was present in the mine and ignited.
More specifically, the lack of continuous ventilation and inadequate rock-dusting to suppress and render harmless the combustible coal dust in mines have been major contributing factors to mine disasters. Other probable causes are open flames, friction sparks, and static electricity, the reports state.

TANDARDS FLUORIDES, now used to control children's tooth decay and a part of some water-supply fluoridation programs, but a chemical rival of the standard dental filling.
Preliminary research were announced that phosphates used with fluoride may be more effective than fluoride alone for reducing cavities and protecting the teeth.
The researcher said "there was more reduction in tooth cavities with fluoride-phosphate than fluoride alone." He added that the fluoride-phosphate combination "offers promise of an even more effective, safer and more pleasant method for prevention of tooth decay."

Flying Saucer Scare in the Cape
Police called in

The Flying Saucer Review is grateful to Mr. Phillip J. Human for having drawn their attention to this interesting case.

On the night of April 24, 1963, a number of persons in Boksburg, a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa, reported seeing a strange lighted object in the sky. The sightings began around 9:15 p.m. and continued until after midnight. The object was described as a large, brightly lighted object which seemed to hover over the town for a considerable time. It was also reported to have changed shape and color during the observations. The Police were called in to investigate the matter, and, according to the report, they did so with obvious difficulty in that the object refused to be detected by them. The reports continued for several days, and much public excitement and speculation was aroused over the incident.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document discussing the New Comet Alcock discovered in 1963.

Extract from "Sky and Telescope" Vol. XXV, No. 9; May 1963

New Comet Alcock

Among the attractions of May skies is a fairly bright comet, 1963b, discovered by G. E. D. Alcock in England on March 19th. At that time it was an 8th-magnitude diffuse glow near Delphinus. The newcomer was moving nearly directly toward the earth; hence its apparent motion was very slow during the next two weeks.

There is close agreement between the preliminary orbits calculated by E.G. Marsden (Yale University Observatory) and Michael McCants (College Station, Texas). Both show that Comet Alcock is moving in a plane almost perpendicular to the earth's orbit, the inclination being 86.9 degrees. The comet will pass through perihelion on May 6th, 1.45 million miles from the sun.

During May the conditions of visibility will be very favorable, because the earth will be between comet and sun. The comet will be at opposition on May 15th, in declination +30 degrees, only six days after perihelion. Thus Comet Alcock will be well placed for viewing all night long by Northern Hemisphere observers, as it moves southward across Draco, Bootes, and Canes Venatici. In June the comet will pass from Coma Berenices into Virgo.

Apparently, Comet Alcock will verse on naked-eye visibility in mid-May, when its integrated magnitude is predicted as 6.6 by Mr. Marsden, 6.4 by Mr. McCants. However, forecasts of comet brightness are always uncertain, and the object might behave differently.

- page 21 -

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed text on a page. I will proceed to extract the text found in the document:

well be a magnitude or two fainter than anticipated. Hence small telescopes or binoculars will probably be required to detect Comet Alcock. Its all-night accessibility will favor special observing projects, photographic and visual.

Systematic observations of the comet's brightness and dimensions are desirable.

A report received from: Maine Air National Guard, South Portland, Maine
On 8 May 1963, at approximately 1255 hours EST, an unidentified object was observed by members of the Maine Air National Guard at South Portland. The object was described as a circular shape, larger than a full moon, and surrounded by a bright glow. The object appeared to be motionless, and was estimated to be at an altitude of 2,000 feet, some 10 miles off the coast, in the Atlantic Ocean area approximately 49°N 49°W.
The object was observed for about 30 minutes, after which it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight at a high speed. No noise, trail or exhaust was observed.
The observation was confirmed by three separate observers, all experienced flight personnel.
No other aircraft were known to be in the area at the time.
This sighting is classified as unexplained and merits further investigation.

10 a.m., an object described by witnesses as round, about 15 inches long and blue in color, struck a warehouse in Belfast, Maine and exploded. 
The building belonging to the Maple Leaf Dairy Company suffered minor damage from a fire which broke out and was quickly extinguished. It was reported small pink and white clouds followed the explosion.
People in the area reported hearing a high-pitched sound prior to the occurrence. No traces of the mysterious object were found on the nearby ground. 
Mr. floyd G. brittwater, Director of Defense for Knox County, investigated the incident. He stated the high radiation reading registered on the instrument was not enough to indicate contamination from an object from space (for initialing a meteor). The general consensus was that the object was not an ordinary space object.

A report from a reliable source describes a UFO sighting over Belfast at 2:15 AM on May 13, 1963. The object appeared to be circular in shape, with a bright light and trails of light following it as it moved rapidly across the sky. The observer, a member of the Royal Air Force, states that the object's speed was "tremendous" and that it seemed to be under intelligent control. The report also mentions that the object appeared to change direction abruptly and that it was seen by at least two other people. The document discusses the scientific analysis of the sighting, including the observer's claims about the object's size, speed, and maneuverability. The report concludes by stating that the observer's account is considered credible and that the sighting remains unexplained.

LOCAL SIGHTINGS:
SHALANGA FALLS, OHIO - Sat. May 18, 1963
At about 10:45 PM a restaurant worker at Shalanga Falls, Ohio, stopped outside during a restaurant break. He observed a round reddish-orange object which remained stationary for about 15 seconds. He described the object edges as uniform reddish-orange color, and though more brilliant than a condition (traffic) light, was "like a silver dollar," but upon close questioning, the object was determined to have been about the size of a silver dollar at arm's length.
After watching it for what he thought was approximately 15 seconds, the object moved to a position directly to the southeast, where it disappeared at a fast rate of speed, going straight East.
The witness, a male approximately 25 years old, was alone when the observation took place. The object was estimated as overhead at 20 degrees elevation, and about 1/2 mile distant. From the data it would seem that the 25-second observation was in the neighborhood of the intensity as described, just instantaneous disappearance.

DETROIT MILITARY BULLETIN:
We reported an object sighted by two military observers at 2:02 AM EDT on May 18, 1963, over Ravenna, Ohio. That object was determined to be a satellite re-entry scheduled at that time and place under normal atmospheric conditions.

Light follows cars
(1) 20 May 1963 - Napier, New Zealand
Two motorists were driving together along the highway near Napier, New Zealand, when a bright light suddenly appeared and began to follow their car. The light glowed brighter than the car's headlights and kept pace with the vehicle, maintaining a constant position about 50 feet behind it.
After driving for some distance with the light following them, the motorists increased the speed of their car in an attempt to outdistance the light, but it kept up with them effortlessly. Finally, when the car reached the outskirts of Napier, the light swerved sharply and shot away into the distance. The entire incident lasted 15-20 minutes.
There were no other details regarding the appearance or characteristics of the light, except that it was bright, steady, and seemed to be following the car of its own volition. The motorists were perplexed by the experience and could offer no explanation for it.

Mr. . has kindly passed along a clipping to me, dated May 21st, concerning a mysterious flying object which passed a car, where he was a passenger, on a country road at about 9:30 p.m. when he saw a brilliant light about 1000 yards ahead of the car. The light was brilliant and appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter. As the car approached the light it seemed to move away rapidly and then disappeared. The driver of the car slowed down and they both observed the light for about 5 minutes before it disappeared. The clipping states that the light was a metallic or aluminum color and was very bright and clear. There were no sounds associated with the sighting. The observer stated that the light was much brighter than the headlights on the car. The light was observed for several miles.

CAPTAIN ROBERT C. GAMBLE, USN, ATLANTIC AIRCRAFT CONTROLLER, REPORTS THAT AT 1918Z, 8 MAY 1963, HE OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT AT HIGH ALTITUDE OVER THE ATLANTIC OCEAN ABOUT 150 MILES EAST OF NORFOLK, VIRGINIA. HE STATES THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE BRIGHT AND ROUND AND WAS TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. WHEN HE FIRST OBSERVED THE OBJECT, IT WAS ABOUT 30 YARDS AWAY, AND AS HE WATCHED IT, THE OBJECT CLIMBED AT A STEEP ANGLE AND THEN DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS. HE CALLED THE COMMAND POST TO REPORT THE SIGHTING, BUT NO RADAR CONTACT WAS OBTAINED. HE STATED THAT HE WAS POSITIVE THAT THIS WAS NOT ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT.

Youth Chased By Fiery Object

On the night of 20 May 1962, a 17-year-old youth and some companions were driving in a car near Glencoe, Victoria, Australia. Near the Victoria bar, the group slowed down to let another car pass. As they did so, a bright light came on which was dazzling and the youth man stopped the car to find out what it was. The object then moved across the road and the boy started driving again, speeding up. Then the light shot up in the air and went out of sight. Although it was going 50 or 60 miles per hour, the light followed the car. It was as bright as a welder's arc. The youth said, "The boy's father, who reported the incident, said that the boy arrived home nervous, upset and frightened."
A local press report said that a similar object was sighted by 4 other people on the same night, at about 10 p.m. Gawler police were asked to investigate. The people claimed the light, which turned from red to white, followed the car for about 15 miles.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report or document with text describing a sighting in Australia. The text states that the witness reported seeing a "large bright object" in the sky that moved at a "terrific speed" and then hovered and moved away. The report is dated May 27, 1963 and is from Australia.

AUSTRALIA 
Twice the size of a quarter moon, 
it came towards me and then 
hovered, about 2 miles out to sea. 
It was about 30 to 40 feet across 
and went off at terrific speed, he said. In 
the bright moonlight the object was 
clearly seen over an area where he had previously noticed ships.

Astronomer sights saucer:
An astronomer, who wished to remain anonymous, reported sighting a flying saucer. The astronomer stated that the object was very bright and appeared to be rotating. The saucer was visible for approximately 15 minutes before disappearing from view. The astronomer also reported that the object appeared to be under intelligent control and did not behave like a typical celestial object.

There is no photograph in this image. The image shows a typed document with text describing a UFO sighting that occurred on May 31, 1963 in Canberra, NSW, Australia. The text recounts the details of the sighting, which was described as a "mysterious orange object" that was observed moving across the sky. The document also mentions that the sighting was reported to a "world authority on the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon".

Here is the full text as it appears in the document:

NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)  
about 31 May 1963
Canberra, NSW, Australia

ASTRALIAN SIGHTNG SAUCER - - -
Canberra, NSW, Australia
The new sighting occurred on May 31, 1963.
A mysterious orange object was seen to cross the sky. The witness was unable to establish the speed or altitude. The object appeared to be rotating and it "swayed" from side to side as it crossed the sky. It was observed for about 30 seconds. The witness said it did not lose its brilliant orange light until it disappeared from view beyond the horizon.
The witness is a world authority on the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon and his competence is not questioned. However, he said he could not make a definite identification or classification of the object seen.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, describing an observation of a UFO in Australia.

Astronomers Watch UFO
In Australia

Dr. M. Gliksman, of the Mt. Stromlo observatory, saw a brightly luminous object on May 10, 1962. It was stated that the object was not one of the satellites or planets normally seen in the sky.

The description states that the object was self-luminous and not glowing from reflected light. It was seen to be traveling from west to east, passing almost directly overhead. The object did not change brightness in the 60 seconds it was watched.

The Department of Civil Aviation said no planes were in the area at the time, and it could not have been a meteorite or meteor shower. It appeared to be a large cloud and did not resemble a satellite or planet. The object remained brightly lit for the normal duration of a satellite pass.

The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report document. There is no photograph present on this page. The text on the page describes observations made by Cooper, an Australian astronomer, regarding a sighting of an unidentified object over Australia. The report mentions that Russian astronauts were sent into orbit around the Earth, and discusses the mystery surrounding the object observed by Cooper, including reports of "snowflakes" or "tiny lighted particles" seen near the object.

What Did Cooper See?
Cooper, an Australian astronomer, reportedly saw an unidentified object while observing the sky over Australia. He reported seeing the object on several occasions. The object was visible for an extended period and was described as being very bright. However, the report states that Cooper did not have anything to do with the object itself, and was only observing it.

The text on the page provides details about Cooper's observations and the speculation surrounding the object he saw. It mentions that Cooper's observations were similar to reports from West Australia which indicate unidentified objects were seen near the reentry of space capsules. However, the text states that Cooper's observations did not coincide with any known space re-entries.

The report also discusses the possibility of "snowflakes" or "tiny lighted particles" being associated with the object Cooper observed, but notes that there is no definitive explanation for what he saw.

TDED
EVALUATION of UFO Report From DOW AFB, Maine 26 June 1963

TDED (Lt Col Friend)

1. The two separate tracks are visible on the scope, two of which appear to be aircraft. The third track is at a varying angle as an aircraft riding. The third track is at a varying angle and appears to correspond to the three tracks indicated by the observer.

2. It would appear visual viewing might sight at least one of the tracks as an aircraft under other conditions and subject to being observed. The size and general appearance would likely be those of the observing aircraft and come within a 5 mile radius of the disappearance.

3. Since the "largest" were not seen visually or on any ground radar, and since the apparent speeds are considered too high for normal aircraft, it is likely that these objects represent returns of other equipment or phenomena such as anomalous propagation probably caused by atmospheric conditions.

4. It is still uncertain that the dark was submitted. The range on the scope was not indicated but is assumed to be within the capability of the DOW AFB radar installation. It is believed the weather conditions at the time could have influenced the visual as well as radar operation.
