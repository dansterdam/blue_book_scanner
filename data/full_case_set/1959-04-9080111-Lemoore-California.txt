This image contains two sketches that appear to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The first sketch shows a curved line with the instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it, and a "B" on the same curved line to show the object's position when the observer last saw it.

The second sketch contains two larger sketches. The one on the left shows a straight road or path with buildings or structures on either side, which the instructions indicate represents the "straight up" position of the object. The smaller sketch on the right shows a more distant landscape view.

Transcribed text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

My initial reaction or subject observation of sighting was as follows: I binocularly gas as followed: I saw and caused a the fabulous advancement. The object was in view for about 20 seconds. In color, it appeared a metalic body of luster, set a varied nature. It seem to control its flight.

Other objects observed prior to my observation was none.

Binocular, focus adjusted correctly, I saw clearly the amazing structure and movement of the object. It was not a small point of light, but of substantial size. It seemed to quickly bring out my binocular and make a more detailed observation.

I verified the sighting conditions with the U.S. Department of Commerce. Visibility unlimited, cirrus clouds at 15,000 ft. Altitude of object estimated at 25,000 ft or higher.

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTING

SATE-3 (Major L.J. Tacker)

1. On 22 April 1959, a reported a UFO sighting to the ATIC on ATIC Form 22. The date of the sighting is 12 April 1959. During the investigation, the information listed below was submitted:

a. Number 10 - Description "other" as to brightness of the object, but failed to be specific.

b. Number 11 - Report indicates three objects, but fails to mention if all three were seen at the same time or at different times. If they were seen at the same time, no indication is given if the movement or position of the objects in relation to each other was constant.

c. Number 20 - Did not attempt to draw the apparent path of the object.

d. Number 23 - States the object disappeared in the distance and a subsequent 21 states the object again only five seconds from when it disappeared. However, there is no mention of radial velocity in the report.

e. Number 36(2) - It is ATIC policy to categorize all cases which have insufficient evidence as "Insufficient Information". This case should be reclassified in this category.

Number 39 - Indicates a speed in excess of 1000 MPH. However, the angular velocity he recalls is only approximately 2-3 degrees per second.

2. It is stated the object was in sight from five to ten seconds, but had less than the recorded five seconds when it disappeared from sight.

3. Suggest you send another questionnaire as a reference with your letter requesting clarification.

The text in the document is as follows:

23 May 1959

Dear ___,

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of 7 May 1959 concerning your recently observed unidentified flying object.

The United States Air Force is charged with the responsibility of investigating and studying all causes of unidentified flying objects, with the intention of informing the public, through the media of the press, all we learn in this regard.

To date the Air Force has, in our investigation of many cases, uncovered no positive evidence of the existence of vehicles of unknown origin flying through our atmosphere. Even though many sightings remain unexplained, we have found no evidence that unidentified flying objects constitute any threat to the security of the country. Other than the remote possibility of a hoax or mistaken identity, etc.

For your information, I am including the latest Department of Defense fact sheet on this subject. They may have some information in this report which will assist you. They may also indicate that this office, which is the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for all investigations of unidentified aerial phenomena, has forwarded their evaluation to you.

Sincerely,
[Signature]

The Honorable James H. Douglas, Secretary of the U. S. Air Force Washington 25, D. C.
Dear Mr. Secretary:
Congratulations! If these unconventional flying vehicles, I observed recently, are a part of your Air Force, you are certainly to be complimented.
My observations, supported by those of three others here, indicated that these performances are most amazing and astounding. If they, truly, are not a part of your Air Force, God help us! Certainly, you must be interested in what is going on in our air space; and on these three occasions here mentioned, we observed the performances of these ships far exceeding anything we had ever seen before. What is the evaluation of these ships' performance and missions? If so, please advise the procedure for a similar to proceed.
Myself and three other responsible observers, in this vicinity of the day, the performances of three of these extraordinary unconventional flying devices, with the use of binoculars which left nothing to the imagination... would appreciate an early reply as to whether these unconventional flying objects are a part of your Air Force. If not, what are you doing about it?
Most respectfully yours,
