15 JULY 1965
CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA

AGO (1.52)
CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA, JULY 15 (AP)--A MYSTERIOUS GLOWING OBJECT -- HOVERING NEAR CANBERRA AIRPORT WHILE THE U.S. MARINER SPACE PROBE WAS TAKING OFF -- SHOT UPWARD AFTER 20 MINUTES AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT, OBSERVERS SAID. THEY SPOTTED THE OBJECT SUNDAY MORNING. CONTROL TOWER CREW SAID IT HUNG SUSPENDED IN THE AIR FOR A PERIOD OF 20 MINUTES. WHEN THE SUN GLINTED ON IT, IT BECAME CLEARLY VISIBLE. THEY SAID IT DISAPPEARED WHEN THE OBJECT SHOT UPWARD AT A TREMENDOUS SPEED. EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT OBJECT WAS SIGHTED FROM TWO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. IT IS UNUSUAL TO HAVE SUCH CONSISTENT SIGHTINGS FROM SEPARATE OBSERVERS.

CASE WAS THE FABR. OBJECT OVER CANBERRA MARS RECEIVING STATION WAS SIGHTED SCINTILLATING" OF A MYSTERIOUS OBJECT. 

SEVERAL PERSONS IN WARMINSTER, ENGLAND, SAID LAST WEDNESDAY THEY SAW A FIERY GLOWING OBLONG OBJECT IN THE WESTERN SKY. A FARMER SAID A FOOTBALL SHAPED OBJECT TOOK OFF FROM HIS FIELD AT 4:30 P.M. THURSDAY. THE ARGENTINE NAVY REPORTED THE OBJECT INTERFERED WITH INSTRUMENTS MEASURING MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES.

OFFICIALS SAID WHAT THEY SAID WAS A MYSTERIOUS OBJECT, FLYING OVER THE AZORES AND PORTUGAL LAST SATURDAY. IT APPEARED TO BE A LONG BALLOON MADE.

NO CASE:  Information Only
SOURCE:  APRO Bulletin, Sep-Oct 65

UAO Over Canberra Airport
On the 13th of July, a crew of a USAF transport plane carried the following report to APRO:
On take-off from Canberra airport, the crew sighted a large, bright, glowing object which hovered near Canberra airport while the U.S. Marine aircraft was in the air.
The initial story said that the object "has battled experts in Canberra." The object was spotted by air traffic control officers and other ground aircraft observers on the field. Six members of the traffic control tower told the press that the object was "suspended" at about 5,000 feet for 40 minutes and that when the sun glinted on it, it became prefectly visible. A USAF plane was sent out to identify it. 
In the initial press story, experts were quoted as saying that if it was evidence, it could not be identified. The station, the report said, had unusual difficulty in locking on to the object by radar at the time.

EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH, LOUISIANA, FLYING SAUCERS (8-4507)
FLYING SAUCERS, WRITER - ASSOCIATED PRESS, WRITER
NEW YORK, JULY 29, CAPE SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SAY THEY ARE SEEING STRANGE OBJECTS AND BEINGS. COMMENT FROM ANTARCTICA TO ENGLAND COME REPORTS OF MYSTERIOUS FLYING OBJECTS. DURING THE PAST 20 YEARS NUMEROUS SIGHTINGS HAVE BEEN REPORTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, BUT THESE SIGHTINGS REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED.
WHAT AT LEAST FIVE SIGHTINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, BUT THESE SIGHTINGS REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED.
WHAT A. RUNAWAY NAVY BALLOON LAUNCHED IN CANADA, MARYLAND TURNED OUT TO BE A RUNAWAY NAVY BALLOON LAUNCHED IN CANADA.
WHAT IS BEING CALLED ABOUT 6,000 SIMILAR REPORTS WHICH HAVE LOOKED INTO BY THE AIR FORCE AND ONLY 647 REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED,AND MOST OF THESE ARE FAIRLY CLOSE OBSERVATIONS THAT SHOW SOMETHING WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO ITS INVESTIGATORS. THEY CAN'T BE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BY AIR FORCE SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANTS.
MOST OF THESE RECENT SIGHTINGS COULD BE EXPLAINED. AND MAY BE INFORMATION WAS MADE AVAILABLE.
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THE OBJECTS CAME FROM SPACE. SIMILAR SIGHTINGS WERE CAUSED BY ORDINARY OBJECTS IN THE SKY, BUT CANNOT BE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BECAUSE OF LACK OF SUFFICIENT OBSERVATION, ACCORDING TO MAJOR KEYHOE, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE FOR AERIAL PHENOMENA IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

THE CONCLUSION OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANTS IS THAT THESE THINGS MUST BE KNOWN SOME ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC OR MILITARY DEVICES OPERATED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THEY EXISTED FOR SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BUT HAS A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF POLICY OF EXPLAINING THE SIGHTINGS AWAY THAN WE COULD HAVE KNOWN THEM BEFORE. IT APPEARED IN EUROPE JULY 7, 1954, SHE WAS VERY FRIGHTENING," SAID MRS. DORA KOFLOK, WHO, WITH HER DAUGHTER, OBSERVED A LARGE FOOTBALL-SHAPED OBJECT NEAR THEIR SOUTHERN SKY NEAR WARRENTON, VA. 
"THAT SAME NIGHT IN VALENSOLE, FRANCE, MAURICE MASSE SAID HE SAW A DISC-SHAPED OBJECT DESCEND AND TAKE OFF AT HIGH SPEED.
WHEN SOME AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS WERE STUDIED, A LARGE FOOTBALL-SHAPED CHANGE TOOK PLACE, SAID THE ARGENTINE NAVY, REPORTED BY THE ANTARCTIC NEWSPAPER A SHORT TIME LATER.
THESE HAPPENED WITHOUT AFFECTING ANY KNOWN PHYSICAL LAWS, AND CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY ANY ORDINARY MEASURING TECHNIQUE. 
WE SUGGEST THE VILLA DO PORTO WEATHER STATION IN THE AZORES SAID A GLOWING 
OBJECTS HOVERED OVER THE ISLANDS AND THAT GLOWING OBJECT STAYED AROUND THE GLOBE ON JULY 15. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OFFICERS AND OTHERS APPARENTLY ON THE SEE THAT IT REMAINED VISIBLE FOR 40 MINUTES, THEN DISAPPEARED WHEN AN AIR FORCE PLANE WAS SENT TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION.
ANOTHER SIGHTING WAS REPORTED LAST NIGHT AT WEYMOUTH, MASS. SHE SAW A ROUND LIGHT LIKE A STAR, EXCEPT IT KEPT MOVING AND OCCASIONALLY FLASHING BLINKING. IT SOUNDED LIKE A FLYING SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE.

NO. CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)      25 JULY 1965
SHARON HILL, PENNSYLVANIA

Dr. J. Allen Hynek
Dir. Dearborn Observatory &
Professor of Astronomy
Northwestern University, Illinois

Dear Dr. Hynek,

I would like to report the sighting of a UFO on the night of July 19 at 9:55 p.m. to 10:30 approximately. There was a small white light that my wife and I were lying on a rock ledge listening to a baseball game on the radio, when I was looking towards the sky. I noticed an object moving slowly, thinking this was an old radio satellite. As we continued to watch, it changed its pace "look, there's an echo satellite!" I first noticed it as it headed east, the second star on the handle of the dipper and the third star. As we're surrounded by low mountains, the big dipper was low in the northern horizon.

As we traced its path along the stars keeping a paralell or perpalicular to the stars or constellations, we noticed that it changed its path twice. First, towards the southwest and then just at about five seconds before continuing. As it went twenty degrees (approximately) from the horizon, it stopped. At this time we could see it change colors from a bright green to a reddish-orange beacon at an airport but sometimes slow and sometimes fast.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed report or document describing a UFO sighting.

Text in the document:

As we watched it there, hovering, for ten minutes, we saw it grow a little dimmer. I suggest that we go home for my telescope and bring it back. We can the 3 mile to my house in 3 minutes and I took the car back to the ledge. When we got there, the object was still there but going dim. I tried to get a fix on it but it had already grown dim and my sight on the telescope was off as I haven't used it in nearly six months.

As we left the ledge, the object was still in the same place, still very, very dim.

Could you explain this to me? Four pairs of eyes don't lie!

I am sixteen years old and a Junior in Shamokin Area High School.

Yours truly,
Shamokin, Penna.

FOWLER 15 JULY 1965
SHERBORN, MASSACHUSETTS

SUBJECT: UFO Report - 15.30 July 1965 (Sherborn, Massachusetts)
DATE: 29 August 1965
FROM: Raymond E. Fowler, Chairman, NICAP Massachusetts Subcommittee
TO: NICAP
cc: PROJECT BLUEBOOK

The following report provides information concerning the sighting of a UFO at Sherborn, Massachusetts on 15.36 July 1965 10:30 PM and 2:00 AM EDT by Marietta A. Abbott, a resident of Sherborn and a licensed airplane pilot.

This subcommittee is still in the process of evaluating over 40 UFO reports received from early in July to the date of writing. Several have been eliminated as Venus, a huge kite carrying a flare, the echo satellite and misidentification of an aircraft. Because of the volume of reports being received, detailed accounts and our evaluation will be slow coming to NICAP. The continuing "FLAP" as casually adding us "UFO-weary"?!?

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report from 7/15/5 & 7/16/5. The report describes a UFO sighting that occurred near Sherborn, Massachusetts, where a self-luminous light source was observed traveling at a high rate of speed. The report provides details about the sighting, including the time, location, and witness observations. The text also mentions other UFO sightings in the area during that time period. The report is signed by Raymond E. Fowler, a NICAP Investigator.

UFO SIGHTING SUMMARY SHEET

UFO Report - 7/15/5 & 7/16/5 

WITNESS: Williston, MA.
PLACE: Sherborn, Mass. 
TIME: 1st Sighting- 10:30 PM EDT
       2nd Sighting- 2:00 AM EDT

BACKGROUND:
The report was carried in the "Herald News"(c). Fall River, Mass. A personal interview with witnesses in Sherborn, Mass. including the press and NICAP members and 2 local UFO group had already
taken place by NICAP. This preliminary information was used when the official NICAP report was made.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT # 1:
The object sighted at 10:30 PM was a self-luminous light source comparable in size to a bright star. It was observed travelling in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed. The unusual features about the object wore its rapid acceleration and deceleration, the manner of its flight, and the absence of any blinking lights which are characteristic of aircraft. The object was not resolvable through binoculars.

SIGHTING ACCOUNT # 2: 
The object was sighted at 2:00 AM EDT. 15 - 20° above the western horizon. The witness, a woman, was awakened observing the object. The object made a sudden stop and hovered momentarily directly overhead. As the woman watched, the object shot straight up at a phenomenal speed. There were no sounds associated with the object. The woman stated she had not been earlier the same evening the woman saw the object ascend to a stationary center of yellow-white light, then descend rapidly in a straight line behind distant trees.

EVALUATION:
During both sightings the sky was clear and many stars were visible. No flights or aircraft were detected. The witnesses' reaction and excitement indicates they observed an unusual phenomenon. Their descriptions of the objects' motions and characteristics cannot be explained by known devices. Other UFO sightings in this general area in July warranted a report to NICAP.

The full account of these above-mentioned incidents occupies a full page in each of the consecutive editions of the Buenos Aires newspaper "Cronica," (9/24/65-9/27/65), and space permits us to give here only the first of the incidents. On the night of 15th September, 1965, while driving home from the center of the city, a group of witnesses observed an intensely luminous object in the sky. It was a very large object, very luminous, bluish in color, but the color varied slightly. It seemed to produce a sort of halo or luminous effect.

Although we could not see it clearly where its upper part ended, the outline seemed to be regular and to have a shape rather like that of a short cone. Although we could not determine exactly where its upper part ended, the outline seemed to be regular and to have a shape rather like that of a short cone. According to the calculations made, it was 10 to 15 meters (yards) in diameter. In a moment we were enveloped in a luminous haze. The object seemed stationary, and no sound was heard. The ground hid it, but we continued seeing the light: it produced. Finally the light went out completely. We then continued our journey to the ranch, where we found that the laborers had seen it also.

SAUCER WITH LIGHTED WINDOWS IN PARAGUAY: Of the dozens of good sightings made by people throughout Paraguay, one of these witnesses comes to again only a very small part of the night from 2300 to 0430 of 13 Jul 65. The object was observed for about five minutes and was close enough for the witnesses to distinguish clearly - it was round, about five meters in diameter, and was divided into eight or more sections of lighted areas which traveled in a patterned manner, much like sections of a revolving door. The color of the object alternated between blue, white, orange, and red. No sound was heard. The object maneuvered in the sky, stopping at times and then moving again. The object disappeared in the direction of the mountains. The color of the lighted areas varied as the object maneuvered, and several witnesses saw the object twinkling like a star as it went behind clouds.
