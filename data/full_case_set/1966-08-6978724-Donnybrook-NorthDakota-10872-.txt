DONNYBROOK, NORTH DAKOTA
AUGUST 6, 1966

The night investigator called and reported that he had witnessed a U.F.O. in the Donnybrook, North Dakota area the previous evening, August 5, 1966. He described it as a large, bright light that was seen hovering over a field west of Donnybrook for approximately 15-20 minutes. He said that he was unable to get closer to it as it was quite a distance away. 

Arrangements were made for a follow-up investigation on August 6, 1966. I went to the site, accompanied by the night investigator, and we spent several hours carefully searching the area but found no evidence of any kind to substantiate the sighting. The field where the U.F.O. was reported to have been seen was thoroughly examined and photographed. No unusual markings or disturbances of any kind were found. The photographs taken show only the normal, snow-covered terrain of the area.

In the absence of any physical evidence to support the sighting, and the inability to locate any corroborating witnesses, I can only conclude that the original report was the result of a misidentification of some relatively common natural phenomenon.

Narrative report by witness
Witness: James Gilliard, a resident of Donnybrook, North Dakota.  
On the night of August 6, 1966, I was driving home from the town of Donnybrook to my farm a few miles outside of town. It was around 10:30 pm and the sky was clear. As I was driving along the country road, I noticed a bright light in the sky ahead of me. At first I thought it might be an airplane, but as I got closer I could see that it was something much larger and brighter. The object was hovering over a field about a mile ahead of me. 
As I got closer, I could make out more details. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was giving off a bright, glowing light. It was making no sound at all. I slowed my car down to get a better look, but as soon as I did, the object suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view. 
I continued driving home, but I was quite shaken by what I had just seen. When I got home, I immediately contacted the local authorities to report the incident. They advised me to make a written statement, which I have done here.
