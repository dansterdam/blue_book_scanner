The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a form or report document from Project Blue Book, labeled "PROJECT 10073 RECORD". The document describes observations made on March 28, 1966 in West Milton, Kettering, and Fairborn, Ohio. The observations were made by civilians and describe satellites or satellite-like objects moving rapidly across the sky. The report notes that there are over 30 such objects orbiting the Earth, and the observed objects appeared to have characteristics similar to a satellite, moving at a rapid rate of speed.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

1. DATE - TIME GROUP: 28 March 66 29/0030, 0508-0532
2. LOCATION: West Milton, Kettering, Fairborn, Ohio 
3. SOURCE: Civilian

5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 5-10 Minutes each
6. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
7. COURSE: OFP CASE FILE
8. PHOTOS: DVNo
9. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: DVNo
10. CONCLUSION: Not ECHO 1 or any of the PEGASUS satellites for which we have the schedules. However, there are over 30 satellites orbiting the earth which are visible.
