Observer noted dark mass in front of exhaust. Indefinite shape. Exhaust light shut off completely for 5 seconds. After the exhaust light disappeared the mass was still visible. Exhaust light came on again at a considerable distance further toward the northeast. There was no change in type noted.
Personal interview with witness revealed he had no knowledge of ESP. He felt that the men in the craft were communicating with him. He felt that the craft was an outer-space craft, but a result of ingenious Russian design. Observer stated he had this form of ESP and could sense persons thinking about him from a distance. He believed that the men in the craft were observing somewhat caused them to cut off the exhaust for the period.

The OCR text from the document is as follows:

"34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 16 Aug 1966

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points questioned about your encounter:

There were a number of noticeable wind shifts and to the extent that the D. 0. F. (Direction of Flight) had to be corrected frequently. For example, 5 seconds one direction, 1-1 1/2 seconds the other direction, and as abrupt as the wind shift from East to west that would necessitate at times the complete correcting of the exhaust trail between readings. Occasionally the trail would become completely unsure which direction it was moving - it would literally just drift away, then reappear a split second later in a different direction. The movements appeared erratic, or a series of abrupt movements rather than a smooth continuous motion, as one would expect of a conventional aircraft. The object appeared a silvery white, metallic in structure, rather than a normal aircraft exhaust trail. It was unlike any conventional aircraft exhaust that I have observed. The total observed duration was approximately 20-30 seconds, with frequent abrupt changes in direction and attitude. When the observation terminated the object was still under power and still at an estimated altitude of 8,000 to 10,000 feet. There was no sound associated with this object. This rather confounding 'smoke trail' continued to puzzle me as to the nature of the power source and control system."

Dear Major Quintanilla:

I have given this a great deal of thought before deciding to write you. I feel that it is important that I complete a report, if possible, on a sighting that occurred on the night of July 7, 1966. This sighting was observed and confirmed by two witnesses and I believe it to be quite significant. 

The primary witness was a lady who was an employee of the local U.F.O. organization. She reported sighting a U.F.O. at approximately 9:00 p.m. The object was described as an intense white light which hovered, maneuvered at high speed, and made abrupt turns. At one point the object disappeared and then reappeared. The second witness, a Mr. Dale Girard, also reported observing the same object at the same time.

I realize that this type of report may be of little interest, but I felt it important to submit it for your records. I would be most interested in any comments or advice you may have regarding this incident.

Sincerely,

Dear Sir,
A detailed examination of U.F.O. observation which may be of interest to you was recently made at Warren A.F.B. This observation was of an excellent visual and photographic nature, and it is pertinent to your files. It occurred May 16, 1965 at approximately 8:10 PM, CST, near the town of Girard, Ohio. The object was observed to be approximately 50 feet in diameter, ovoid in shape, and glowing orange in color. It was observed for approximately 30 minutes, during which time it performed various maneuvers, including vertical ascent and descent, and lateral movement. It was observed by several reliable witnesses, including a university professor, a businessman, and a military officer.
Samples of the photographic coverage were processed, and copies are attached for your information. This report is forwarded for your consideration and use.
Sincerely,
John H. Girard

to inquirer name recently published this
my first observation of a u.f.o.
at 1:30 AM on the morning
of the 8th day of july. visibility was 
what was full of stars and the moon appeared
as a sloped crescent, the object was located
in a point tn my southwest, a distance of 
perhaps a fourth of the way from the southwest to
the zenith. It became visible on its southward
movement at the periphery of my vision, the
exhaust was orange. Its exhaust was exactly
in the center, there was steady light and no
flashing. The exhaust was so compact that it
appeared to be a solid well shot through with dark specks running 
the entire length. It could not make out the outline bodily of the craft which moved
the stars as it passed. There were no ible in the dark body of the craft.
what I was able to observe first the exhaust was very compact, completely filling
the trail behind the craft as it moved southward. There was nothing to indicate the
nature of the craft. They should be noted.

Transcribing the text in the document:

I would say that it was at a poper 1000 feet, and about 1 mile southwest northeast. I admit that i was not too minutely at the minutiae of this alliance: for instance one could not see the details of the skin or teeth of features, but from the general outline and a distance of other pernance watching while circling slowly almost overhead, I was fairly certain of the details I have set forth. That is why I stopped, and was keeping stock of the details in the noting - trying to see if I could discover anything more in connection with it.

The object was oval in shape, and appeared to be about 40 feet long, with a height, I would estimate, of about 15 feet. It was brilliantly lighted, not like an ordinary light, but with a greenish glow that seemed to flow over and around it. The lighting was not steady, but pulsated in the manner of a neon light. No wheels or other projections could be seen, and there was no sound at all. The outer surface of the thing seemed to be a metallic finish, although it did not reflect light like a mirror. Once or twice it appeared to wobble slightly in its flight, maintaining its forward motion during this period. Other than that, its flight was smooth and steady.

I hope that this description, while not as detailed as I should like, gives you a reasonably accurate idea of what I saw. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.

Conversation of Major William E. Morley, USAF, and Lt. William F. Marley.
Since I didn't have instruments my first opinion of the size of the object is in error. I thought it was a one dollar bill is in error. Later in comparing it to my hand I discovered it was much smaller, covered by my mistake. On Friday the moon was at the same height and I thought the size should have been a penny. Exhaust was a little larger than the moon and was a little larger than the moon on 7 July. I have some basic scientific background. Now to get description:
Body size - 2 dimes held at arm's length - 75% accuracy 
Using an object to cover object I would use two dimes. I figure the 75% accuracy.
Moon was 3/4 full, 15 degrees above the horizon. Moon had some light on the object. Object passed over the moon. It was about one second.
Now - off the subject. There have been accounts in the pasts so many people have seen UFOs that there must be something to them. I see (2300) - 0100 while watering these.

The text appears to be a detailed description and analysis of an observed UFO encounter, including information about the size, shape, and movement of the object, as well as the witness's scientific background and other relevant details.

Exhaust was silhouetted against the sky. Big bell shaped around and a dark streak through the center. Perfect silhouette of the sky. One penny would cover it.
One thinking it takes a larger object to cover it when it gets high in the sky you don't need anything so big.
There was this white with a dark streak. Pretty sure same size. Can compare it with the moon. Looking straight East and can see it was a light spot coming from the sky and steadily coming closer.
Object passed in back of a street light. Then I could see what I could see the body shape then. It was at 30 deg first then at 60 deg. No sound. Maybe if it was closer I would have heard a noise. That distance would have made a noise. No sound on this. Strange when it came directly in front of it a 45 deg the exhaust was a light switch. Then when it came back on 5 seconds later it was someone had turned on a light switch. No change in the speed. Viewed I had watch on but I was so awe struck didn't have time to look at my watch. I retimed it later. Object didn't disappear. It just blotted it off. From what I could see that I didn't move, seemed to have moved very rapidly. Estimated 3000mph. Went considerably slower than a jet. Similar to a prop slow and low. I feel that the 1000 ft alt is about 50% accurate. Not possibly 2000 ft alt. Everything was so plain. Don't think it was anything like a plane.

for it was over the tree tops and above the houses. Moon was 15 deg. in the eastern sky, object was 45 deg elevation. Exhaust was so large it covered the hole flightpath, so thick it was about 1000 ft. diam. If a jet, it is hard to tell. First saw it in the southern sky. The angle seemed to be from the east. It would have come across the Youngstown factories, twenty miles or so. (Mr. Hoevlle means, approximately 10 - 15 steel factories north of here). It couldn't help but go over the mills.
No haze or clouds, none any where. There were countless stars in the sky.
Looking directly to the east when I noticed light first appear at edge of vision when I first noticed it. Frequently saw aircraft in the air strike was in effect. Airport 5 miles north of us. Getting used to seeing that force going east and west, going north long. Can hear the jets even when they are only specks. I didn't observe protrusions, tail fins, stubby wings, etc. Perhaps this was due to the whiteness.  It wasn't a dazzling white but more like a white in a candle. Similar to a flourescent light. Little brighter than a candle. Bright shiny white in front, dusty brown. It appeared to be 15 - 30 deg. above the moon. Think the angle close. Believe I am within 5 deg. I went out Saturday morning. I went into the post office Squaudon. Major hall. Used to have a jet fighter Youngstown. Used to be going night and day about 10 years ago. Going South. Called out there. I have only mentioned it to a few people. Have come to the conclusion for the fact of national secrecy that I think it is best to keep it quiet. When I am busy I don't blind your eyes. Wasn't as white as a star. More like the white of a candle. Similar to a flourescent light. Little brighter than a candle.

The darting was like a helicopter, might be capable of high speed. Seemed to be for the object to stay on straight course. It was a different type of object than those others have seen. This is the only description can give. This is a mental image from the distance which I observed was fortunate to be so close to see such a large exhaust and the body fairly well.

I don't want my name released. Major Quintanilla informed me that he should not release this name to the newspaper. I heard about a dozen people, including physics teacher who said it could be Russian. Remember 1957 with Sputnik that the schools said we were good as they are. They made me wonder. This was the 40th anniversary of the Communist Revolution in Russia. Next year will be the 50th anniversary. Will that reveal that this next year step moon. We aren't as far as rockets to get to the moon first.

I sent a letter to MacNamara. It is something for Department. Perhaps they think it is best not to give it any don't want it to like a dog's home it deserves a full discussion. My mind has never played me any tricks. Hall, I went down and talked to him personally. He did not give me any ideas. He was going to send a report in. He had a sten tape information down.

Now I would like to go into another subject. If you believe in extra-sensory-perception. Anything is possible. He replied that he had heard of Jean Dixon and a few others. Well there is a lady in Philadelphia who can describe a criminal and tell when a crime is going to happen.

I went to Western Reserve University in 63' and going down the street just as I passed a building I had the feeling he was observing me from 55'. Just as I went into the building the feeling left.
I read late into the night. Cars go along the side of lights go through the walls of the house. Can't place any of these as an emotional reaction.
Wasn't going back to teaching this fall. A school superintendent lives in back of grandparents and I think somebody recommended me because they are trying to get me to the boarding school. His wife is observing us through the house. I never met the Dr. wife, supt of schools. These schools they check on the type of person it hires. On her personality of course of courses and formal kind person. I bought out in the yard and observe his personality then turn and look around he is there. This happens with various persons.

for teaching they come around and check your neighbors and I have a tip off and somebody goes by like a school superintendent. The same thing again and again. Have done it so many times that it is full protection. So, I have this emotional perception. I can't look into the future. Just getting an emotional reaction. Receiving a personality. Observed it approaching from the South didn't get any.

I looked directly up into the sky of those in the craft. Using because I received an impression of him studying the ground. Near this reaction before. Had it from closer quarters. I felt it. Have been able to detect whether it was a man or a woman. This was a different impression from a man than from a woman. Therefore, I had this sure color white. His head was huge, was possibly due to the fact that looking through a telescope. The white appearance was so because high powered telescope influenced the emotions through.

Have never received such an emotional reaction. Getting a mental picture of a man with a huge head. No facial features. down through high power telescope. Color was white because of emotion reaction (I pick this up easily) was very amused. Could grin like card player with an ace up his sleeve. Grin came through and I have had from various people even when I am not looking. After the craft light off the reaction just vanished. This observer had the must have communicated with commander of craft. Saw a man with head. He must not have had a telescope looking through. His dis was of an angry person. He also was a man. His reaction received.

Communication that somebody on the ground had spotted the craft so an explosive order. Could see this emotion. Exhaust went off rather quickly. This happened when every disposition ordered to tell color because of being a small head. 75% Nationality. I know the Russian people that were born in America. They are very much different between the Russian and us. Could be from a lost cloud, like the Swedes. 75% because his skin was white must the Russian. If this craft were coming from another planet I felt something strange in the emotional reaction. didn't received strange to the emotional reaction as Americans do. Nothing strange people from other planets. French only other like cause other Russians. They are most likely ones because of no peculiarities people from another planet. I could be wrong. It is possible from other planet would be similar to that is why I say only 7 They may be built different but they have similar emotional reactions never been true.

Dear Major Quintanilla,
I have a confession to make. When I was in your office Monday afternoon, I did not tell you everything I know about the recent sightings and events. I am sorry I could not be completely truthful with you. Is there anything else I can do to assist in this matter of the reported sighting? I certainly hope my feelings did not confuse you. I believe that in telling you the may trip the balance scales as to whether this craft was from another land from Russia. I am certain I must indicate that the sightings tend toward Russia as a source of the probable nuclear-powered space craft.

What makes me look rad d did not see the window. And the window shade was drawn back, so that whatever which appeared to have had an opportunity to be more correct. In the incident I make for. as stock under the ability of one and which I had experienced - outside.

However, I still go ahead and evaluate my recent sighting of a bright white light as continuing to remain in my mind."

Text from the document:

I don't say much about the body of the craft because I still believe that it was not a manufactured object from the United States. The more which we approximate the mouth of the thing, the more it reminds me of something which is apparently an automobile. This automobile has a windshield, a top, and is the size proportional to their craft. If this craft is a new experimental craft of the United States, I would be disappointed to know that. I don't believe that it was manufactured in the United States. The body of the craft appeared to be rather saucer-shaped. There was a light, a small light, which seemed to be on the top of the craft. As the craft moved, this light did not seem to be stationary, but seemed to be circling on the top of the craft. I did not notice any other lights on the craft. As I said, the craft appeared to be saucer-shaped, and it was hovering close to the ground when I first observed it.

Does this data extend up to the east or west?
Canada to meet the under defense organization across the middle of Canada? is there a flying object, man made or otherwise, capable of standing on end over a certain location and then moving off at an unbelievable rate of speed, by rockets or other similar means?
Are the Prussians coming too? The burning of the fields might indicate an invasion.
If they are coming for a landing the ships would have to reduce altitude gradually, if this could be done without detection. Money might be the object, they have means to bring that which would buy everything under our sun.
By night would they come? If so, even a slight reflection of light from their ships might be visible, and it would be helpful to watch for this.
Since the craft could hover and make vertical takeoffs and landings, any area that has had recent activity of this sort should be watched carefully.
The search has to be made with understanding that they could be among us with the greatest secrecy.

"Dear Major Quintanilla:

I have not as yet been able to get anything that I would consider a good photograph of what appears to be a UFO which I saw on the 7th, and 10th, of July.

The first time, I had some difficulty getting the focus on my camera, and the second time the object was moving too fast for me to get a picture, although I did try to get one.

I noticed many more flights of fighter squadrons from the Youngstown area just tonight, at about 8:30 P.M. Some of these planes appeared to be chasing something, but I could not determine whether there was any connection with the UFO I saw.

I am enclosing some possibly related material on impressions that I received - the impression that the pilot either did not see me or ignored me, and other impressions that I have received which I cannot explain.

I am deeply interested in this problem, and would appreciate any comments or suggestions that you may have regarding this incident."

Transcribing the text in the document:

"The emotional impression which one form the the observation was and the the commanding intelligence which the object disclosed arent of the same variety as the one we may associate with any know earthly phenomenon. I cannot believe that I have ever come close to a similar experience; in fact, I dont believe that I have ever heard of a aimilar experience that a others have had. 

The object seemed to be hovering in a fixed position in the sky, approximately 500 feet above the ground. The way it was suspended and absolutely motionless was in marked contrast to any know type of aircraft, either military or civil. At the same time, there was no disturbance of the atmosphere, no trail of exhaust fumes or condensation, or any visible means of propulsion.

Finally, stand the object which concerned the size which concerned me most. From where I stood, it appeared to be roughly the size of an automobile, which at that distance would make it sizable indeed. If such an object were the size of an automobile and hovering motionless in the sky at a distance of 500 feet, it staggers the imagination - I can scarcely believe what my eyes reported."

Dear major - 
I can't stop thinking of the U.F.O. I observed last month and its implications and potential. The craft appeared to be of definite shape, and the white exhaust or flame from the craft was not clearly visible to me. There was a definite shape, and the craft was not clearly visible. I was in the backyard of my home on the outskirts of the city. I just wanted to mention that the body of the craft appeared in definite shape. This craft appears to be real rather than imaginary.

Sincerely after sighting the craft image was still clear in my mind compare what I would call a normal aircraft to the exhaust light appeared larger reddish purple in color and brighter than the typical pulsating stroke of the exhaust lights from conventional aircraft.

This is the output of the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text found in the document:

This impression from the object as it passed by the witnesses was that it was a metallic, saucer-shaped object, about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and 10 to 12 feet thick at the center, tapering to about 6 feet thick at the outer edge. The object was reported to be a bright, luminous white color, and to have made no sound. The object was observed for an estimated 2 to 3 minutes and was reported to be traveling at a speed estimated to be between 600 and 700 mph. The object was observed by two adult witnesses who were standing together at the time of the observation. The observers were interviewed separately and were found to be reliable and sincere in their reports. Their descriptions of the object were consistent in all the important details.

Text extracted from the document:

I believe that the noise of the house a simulteneous, reduced the sound of the object coming. The noise eliminated much of the silent, soft-sound, moment when it passed overhead. 
The impression which I received told me, more or less, where it was located, but from your letter, I do not appear to be on the 7th of July, a little distance to the north from the a drive by Girard Municipal School, next to the loading docks. 
It sheared seemed to be flying at an altitude of about seventy to eighty feet from the ground. A bright light, or lights, moved very, very fast, and it was a little hard to get used to something like this at first. I was not the only one who saw this phenomenon, and he told me, apparently, what it was, but I do not remember exactly what he said.

It received an emotional impression from THE HIGHTLINE SIGHTING AND INVESTIGATION REPORT 
Dr. Hynek's group made an investigation of this - the Girard, Ohio incident - and we received an emotional description from THE HIGHTLINE SIGHTING AND INVESTIGATION REPORT. He a town houses-a little unhingeand emotionally restraining manner. We assured Hynek that this was the good case, and we received an emotional impression from Dr. Hynek. Their time letter, they spent to the details of the special, they appear that trip, and he was continue around directed direction. Between the time, we received an emotional impression from Dr. Hynek and this information: This was later on that SOME time, we received an emotional impression from Dr. Hynek, that the object was some kind of control-central and it was trying to restrain or make some motion various, and this wave that go not less - 
I wrote and concluded that Dr. Hynek received a letter, from a witness, who had a good drive up there, and did not make any uneducated guesses as to what type of object it was.

"The party chief or boss of the local flying saucer investigating group was not home. The party chief or boss of the local flying saucer investigating group was not home. The party chief or boss of the local flying saucer investigating group was out and what was done could not be ascertained through this source. 

Consequently, we, the two investigators, proceeded to interview the key investigator, who was the acting chief in the absence of the party chief or boss. This key investigator stated that the photograph was taken by the group's photographer, who was an amateur but adequate photographer. The photographist was a Carpenter, employed as a meat cutter, who resided in Girard, Ohio. 

The key investigator stated that the negative and print of the photograph was turned over to the party chief or boss of the local investigating group as soon as it was developed. He said he did not know what became of it thereafter. This means the photograph and its analysis is in the files of the party chief or boss and not available to the two investigators at this time."

Transcription of the text in the document:

It appears that it must have been some kind of a phenomena in the sky. There is something that I cannot quite explain. It seemed to appear from a distance of approximately 3 miles. At first it appeared to be coming from the horizon in a horizontal movement. As it moved across the eastern sky, near the zenith, it seemed to oscillate up and down and side to side. During this movement, it appeared to expand and contract in size. At times it seemed to halt or hover briefly, and at other times it would appear to move at a high rate of speed. After maneuvering in this fashion for several minutes, the object suddenly accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared in a westerly direction. I noticed that the craft had a round shape with a bright illuminated undersurface, without any visible means of propulsion. The light seemed to emanate from the entire body of the craft, as though the craft were moving without any exhaust light or trail. After the craft had disappeared, I remained motionless and continued to scan the sky for a few additional minutes in hopes of seeing it again, but it did not reappear.
Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

Dear sir:
I would like to make a report may be of interest to the Defense Department. I am a resident of Girard, Ohio, in northeastern Ohio. 
Yesterday, July 17th, a brilliant object sppeared over my home as it have never seen before.
It was outstanding and moved at a terrific speed. I noticed its light apparantly from the northwest at about a 30-degree angle to the horizon. It could have been 1,000 feet or more against the dark sky. It moved a great distance in just a few seconds and then disappeared. I mentioned it to my wife, and she saw the same thing. It was absolutely silent. I heard no sound.

Text transcription:

I couldn't detect any wiring or lights of any kind on it. It just sort of blasted off completely. I couldn't detect any trail or smoke whatsoever. It seemed to be traveling at terrific speed, possibly faster than the eye could see. I just got a glimpse but there was no sound.

I am a high school language teacher. I'm a considerable interest in science and I can mention a definite return (I have known many times an almost identical) thing. I've observed this interesting phenomenon on two or three occasions in the past and it seems to be much the same. What one could call inexperienced and untrained eyes have often passed without serious examination. I have passed an overhead a couple times without really grasping the meaning of it.

Fifty cent pieces to have been found in the ground near the height that might also indicate that there or fifty cent piece found in a mold the field indicating a possibility that some might have been hidden there

The object was about 40 to 50 feet in diameter as estimated the main thing was that it seemed to completely cover the exhaust sight the width of the object would not allow a half a dollar to be seen from the ground.
