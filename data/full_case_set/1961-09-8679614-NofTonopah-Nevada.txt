Subject: Unidentified Flying Object

Sunday night, September 24, 1961 at 11:40 P.M. (PST), a mile north of the Five Creek Ranch, Nye County, Nevada, the following occurred:

At that time I stopped my vehicle and observed an intensely large, bright, light hovering over the high mountain ridge in the Toquima Range. This mountain ridge was in the direction on the south slope of Andrews Canyon. I observed this unusual object for about five minutes during which time it remained in a vertical position and then went out. It was a brilliant white light, and in contrast to the darkness of the night it was easily seen and could be watched for at least five more minutes as it went out or switched off.

I immediately placed a collect call at 12:35 A.M. to the Central Intelligence Agency, Washington, D.C. The operator rather than to continue disturbing the ranch people, I then drove to the Frontier Tavern, a business establishment located about twelve miles east of Austin on Highway 50. There I picked up a telephone and again reported the observation as I had to the CIA.

In my opinion, this was no conventional aircraft. It was an object foreign to our normal experience, and there are no known aircraft that could execute the maneuver I had observed.

Unidentified Flying Object
************
The weather in Monitor Valley Sunday night was as follows: the wind was calm, the sky absolutely clear, and the stars were bright. While observing the first-described object, I was outside of my home in Monitor Valley, Nevada, looking north in the sky like just above the horizon. The light was white, when the beam had focused in a downward vertical position, the object became completely dark and out of sight. There was a sound of no kind of any motor or engines. There was complete silence.
On September 27 I traversed the entire area where the object could have landed (a distance of about three miles from my observation position), but found no evidence of landing gear, impressions or any evidence that anyone or anything had been there. This particular area is quite inaccessible, I found no evidence of any truck or vehicle tracks, there was no evidence that man or anyone had been there, and within some time after that date, the area experienced heavy rains which would have demolished any evidence that might have been left.

UFO ANALYSIS SHEET

Location: N. of Tonopah, Nevada
Date (Local): 24 Sep 61
Hour (Local): 23:10
Hour (2 Time Group) 2567/Z 24 Sep 61
Satellite: -----------------
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc.) #1 - Prob Jupiter
Radar Analysis (ID-El): N/A
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc.): ------------
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc.: --------------
Other: 2 - Unidentified
Evaluation of Source Reliability: VERY RELIABLE
Analysis and Conclusions: The first object was described as a large bright light, with changing positions reported, possibly a little lower. However, as it was just above the horizon, it could appear to be in different positions and it was difficult to estimate its altitude. It remained motionless, except for the excessive duration and the apparent location, both of which were a possible explanation for this phenomenon. A second object, smaller and with less luminosity, was reported that may have aided in identifying it.

Gentlemen:

Pursuant to our previous telephone convIErsation, I am sending you a transcript of notes we
made regarding a sighting af an object which occured on our radar site on 24 September 1961.

On Sept. 24, 1961, a station alarm was started indicating an object was on our radar
screens.. The object appeared to be moving in an erratic manner and was tracked by
continuous for 15 to 30 minutes with our RAPO' radar at a distance of three miles.

On Dept 29, 1961, a report was submitted to the CI&A and Project Blue Book
requesting additional information on projects which were being conducted in our
area. To date, we have not heard from them, with the exception of the routine
acknowledgement of receipt of the report. 

Respectfully yours,

letter dated 16 September 1961, that he observed an unidentified object sighted near Tonopah, Nevada on 13 September 1961. The object was described as the Planet Jupiter, however, the observation and maneuverability of the second object suggest a possible connection with the reported UFO sighting.

September 20, 1963

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your letter of August 12, 1963, to the Foreign Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has been forwarded to this Headquarters for reply.

Your report of September 29, 1961, was evaluated and placed on file. The initial object, sighted north of Tonopah, Nevada, was evaluated as the planet Venus in this position. The initial report indicated the object's hovering and maneuverability, however, the final conclusion considered the duration and maneuverability as normal for the planet Venus. Consequently, the second object is carried as unidentified.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
