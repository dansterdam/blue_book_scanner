Capt. Ruppelt:

On Sat. July 5th I spoke at some length to the Duty Officer, Capt. James, about a disc or sphere that was visible in the beam of a searchlight on dates covering about a year and a half in the general Cincinnati area.
(Capt. James requested I send you a written report covering dates etc.

The object was spotted by accident when the light was swung to sighting when changing course. This was on Aug 19 1947 10:15 P.M., navy jet chase, and was held in the beam, in the same spot in the sky until 11:10 p.m. when the light was turned out.

The object was last seen, as far as I know on Jan. 11, 1950 still in the exact center of the sky. A list of Dates and places follows.

Here is the text from the document:

Unknown object without any type of angle and
with a twenty mile base the described phenomena
inferred is fantastic.

My first thought was of some refraction trick
caused by various layers of clouds or ice
particles causing a lens effect, or a special
atmosphere' condition causing a refraction.
This was disproved by noting the contrasting
surrounding conditions. It was seen between towering
thunderheads just after a storm, although there
were fast moving layers of stratus clouds
in bunch, clear cold stardust nights and hot
hazy nights.

I can't think of any condition which would
a refraction, would not move if you move the
source of light.

We could move an automobile 10 or 15 degrees
to the right or left and still see the ufoject
dimly in the same spot. Or we could shine the
light in the eastern tip of the street object
or cut it in half. None of these things would
be done if it were a refraction of the light
itself.

TO: The Inspector General, USAF, 5th District Office of Special Investigations, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio

1. Files at this headquarters disclose that Mr. ***** forwarded a letter to the Air Force (ATTN: General Vandenburg) dated 28 Oct 49. He also called the Intelligence Department at this headquarters on 26 October 49. At that time, General ****was also carried accounts of objects picked up in the beam of a searchlight belonging to Mr. *****. However, AIFC files do not contain any reports indicating that General Paisley actually saw an aerial object. If such a report is available, this command would like a copy.

2. A verbal report by personnel connected with this project at that time indicates that Mr. ****** acted strangely at the time of a visit by an OSI agent. He reported, that he carried a can of telescope in his possession at all times in order to observe or photograph flying saucers. It was also stated that he attempted to photograph a so-called "flying saucer" through the office window at the time of the visit.

3. While this command is in no position to make a psychological analysis of Mr. *******, it appears that he is a very sincere individual convinced that he has observed flying objects which he thinks represents a threat.

4. However, it is apparent from the information he has supplied that his background is far from technical. As far as can be ascertained, he has had little or no experience in aerial observation, for example, as would be the case if he were a pilot. Consequently, the information he has furnished based on his personal observations is a poor basis on which to conduct a technical investigation. In addition, AIFC files disclose no other reports of observations concurrent with Mr. *******, by other trained observers as indicated in the basic letter.

5. The photograph which was included, was reviewed by photographic specialists at AIFC. While the light spot on the picture cannot be positively identified due to the lack of information and control of all the factors concerned, there are several logical possibilities. It is considered that it would serve no purpose to list these possibilities. However, the illusions which are created by searchlight beams passing through clouds is a known phenomenon.

6. It would be interesting to determine whether Mr. ******** has
taken other pictures of this nature and what the results of such photo-
graphy has been. The negative of the picture in question would also be
of interest.

7. However, in view of the time and efforts already expended on
the observations of Mr. ******** with no apparent results, it is rec-
ommended that this particular case be considered closed at this time.
This recommendation is also based upon the possibility that contacting
him may result in additional press articles on a subject which will
again require this command to expend additional man-hours. In the
event this man again contacts the Air Force for a detailed answer to
his letter, AWC will prepare a reply.

Dear Sir;

I'm taking time out while on-route around
on a diversion short to write you concerning an
odd subject.

In Oct. 1949 I asked you to investigate an
object in that traveled over Cincinnati.
You sent a (Capt. James) of Army Stuart I still
Dist at C.S.I. to investigate. Old gent he was very
interested - seemed to be. We tried to show him
said object personally but could never contact him
at the right time. After a few weeks he told us not
to bother him further. This object perhaps he does
desired it to be a secret A.S. project.

Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.
12 October 1949

On 12 October 1949, about 11:15 o'clock, I was sitting behind a B-29 which was parked on the Main Alert Parking Ramp and I was facing approximately South East, when I saw a white looking round object that had the appearance of a balloon about 6" in diameter, coming from a Southward direction at an enormous rate of speed and, compared to the size of a B-29, it seemed to be about 35,000 feet in altitude. It seemed to curve slightly and disappear in a North East direction within approximately 45 seconds. I called to S/Sgt Boggs and S/Sgt Denning to look at it. Both boys said that they saw it and I called to about three other crew men, that were under the wing, to come look at it and due to the fast disappearance they were unable to see it.

This object was of a silver color but I did not notice any bright reflections from it and it appeared to have no external configurations nor vapor trails. The disappearance was sudden and there seemed to be no noise. The object seemed to pass between here and Alamogordo.

The image appears to be a photocopy of a very faint photograph or a poorly captured image with a high level of contrast and low detail, making it difficult to distinguish any specific features. What can be observed is a light, diagonal streak across the middle that could potentially be an artifact or the subject that the photograph is intended to show. There are also two rivet-like spots towards the top of the framed area, which suggests the original photograph might have been pinned or mounted at one time.

As for acting as an OCR to produce and output all the text found in the document, there is no discernible text present in this image.

The image appears to be a sketch, rather than a photograph. It is a hand-drawn illustration depicting some objects in the sky, with annotations to describe their positions or movements. Here’s the text present on the document:

The text appears to be discussing observations and events recorded, possibly related to electricity or energy surges coinciding with visual confirmations. The references to "book personnel visual," "blue," and "white visual" may pertain to codes, labels, or identifiers for either people or equipment, and the dates and times likely document when these events occurred.

At Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico.                         12 October 1949.

I was standing out on the Ramp at Aircraft 103. The thing
I saw seemed to be traveling pretty fast. I thought at first it
was a balloon. Then I saw it was traveling too fast for that.
It was a round looking thing and was white or made out of aluminum.

To the best of my knowledge it looked to be anywhere from
8,000 to 10,000 feet altitude, and about 75 to 80 degree above the
horizon. It was headed North-East. It was flying straight all the
time I saw it; and I watched it until it went out of sight. I
haven't seen a jet go as fast as it was at that altitude. It was
about 8 to 10 miles at it closest place to me. It did not have
any wings or tail.

Dear Sir;

All have been very quiet upon our project "saucer" watch except for educational purposes. At different times recently we have picked up an object at altitudes over 30,000 feet which we speak of as a "flying saucer"--it is not a flying saucer or anything like it - according to other popular conception.

Have been trying to obtain an interview with Wright-Patterson officials but they are not interested - which leads me to believe you are aware of its identity.

On Sunday Oct 23 while subjects approached close to this large disc, under circumstances which I consider alarming and serious.

I have been very careful to obey a word of all weather conditions and have much

Box 481
Wilson, North Carolina
October 24, 1949

UNCLASSIFIED

From: LCDR
To: District Intelligence Officer, 6th ND
Subj: Unexplained aerial object, Sighting of -

The undersigned officer sighted an unexplained air borne object at 1638 o'clock on the 23rd day of October 1949, from his premises in the Town of Wilson, North Carolina, under the following circumstances:

The undersigned was out of doors in the company of four children from eleven to twelve years of age. The sky was cloudless. Surface wind was from the north, moving approximately four miles per hour. From official weather reports secured later, the surface winds maintained the same direction in the upper atmosphere and gradually increased in strength to about forty-two miles an hour at ten thousand feet. The sun had just dipped completely behind a screen of trees and the entire western segment of the sky was brightly illuminated.

At the time mentioned, the undersigned heard the sound of an airplane going to ther northwest. A military plane, appearing to be a P-47, was sighted in the northwest traveling from north to south at an altitude of from 5,000 to 7,500 feet on a course which it is estimated would carry it from two to three miles west of the position occupied by the writer. At approximately the proceeding, at maximum speed. Upon their attention being called to the plane, the children, in looking for it, sighted an object which was not an airplane in the southwest sector of the sky. This writer and all of the children then directed their attention to this object. At this instant the plane previously referred to was north of the sun. The object was south of the sun with the angle between the plane and the object from the writers position, being estimated at from a 45 degree to a 60-degree arc measured on the horizon. The object was round, white, and shiny. It is estimated that it was at a height of from 20,000 to 30,000 feet. It appeared to be traveling in a southerly direction on the same course as the plane referred to but was at a much greater altitude and appeared to be traveling with much greater speed than the plane. Although the object was round, it was impossible to tell whether it was disc shaped or spherical. This object remained in the writer's view for a period from 30 seconds to one minute. It maintained an even course and constant rate of speed. It is emphasized that it was apparently much faster than the plane. No clouds were observed in the sky. Its comparative size is estimated to be one-half the length of the fuselage of the plane previously referred to.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

The following article appeared in the BIRMINGHAM AGE-HERALD, Birmingham,
Alabama, 25 October 1949:

"STRANGE OBJECT IN SKY SHUFFLES TO BUFFALO BY WAY OF TALLADEGA

"It was the strangest sight over soon over Talladega, Ala., and Buffalo, N.Y.

"It was moon-shaped and silvery looking. And it had twin tails that seemed
to shoot off a trail of vapor as it traveled eastward over Talladega.

"The astronomical phenomenon was sighted shortly before noon in Talladega
yesterday. Radio bulletins got most of the citizens there to scanning the sky.

"Nobody could explain it. Guesses were that it was a meteor. Scientists
in Birmingham shrugged and said maybe it was the moon.

"Only a moon doesn't have a tail. Much less two of them, pointed and spouting.

"Whether it was the same thing or another body, folks in Buffalo, N. Y. last
night were agog over a 'mysterious something in the sky.'

"Humorous sky gazers saw the 'something' in Buffalo, according to an
Associated Press dispatch.

"Most agreed that it gave off a bright light. But beyond that, it was hard
to get two descriptions exactly alike.

"Some folks in Buffalo said it looked light a big spot of blue.

"Richard DAVIS, Buffalo Science Museum astronaut, said it might have been a
shower of meteors. Other folks called it a 'green ball of fire.'

"Some said it was 'an immense skyrocket.' That's not at all the way things
looked over Talladega. But maybe it didn't glow because of the daylight.

"Whatever it was, it was the fourth sky phenomenon reported this month.

"On Oct. 14, residents in Northern Ontario, Toronto and Buffalo reported
seeing a 'blinding, bluish white blaze of light' and/or a 'big ball of fire with
a long trail'.

"Later, a Canadian authority said they probably saw a fireball
or meteor, a fireball being bigger than the usual meteor.

"Last Monday, residents of Lynors, Ontario, reported they saw
a huge streak of fire race through the sky, perform a neat loop and
disappear."

(b) Address: Box 569, Holloman AFB. 
(c) Occupation: Tech Aide - Lower Atmospheric Research. 
(d) Place of business; Holloman AFB, Electronic and Atmospheric 
Research Section. 

(e) Hobbies: Sports 
(f) Ability to determine Excellent observer. 21 months 
experience as observer. 
(g) Reliability: Excellent. 
(h) Notes relative to observer: None 
(i) Sightings in general - none previous. 
(2) How attention was drawn to object Was looking around 
at the sky; picked up movement of object. 
(3) Degree of Fatigue: None. 

(i) Witnesses: 
The only other witness was Sgt. MARION H. GRAVES, who was 
tracking an observation balloon at the time of the 
sighting. He observed what appeared to be something 
crossing the field of vision of the theodolite with 
such speed as to cause a streak. 

3. M/Sgt STEVENS was free eading data of drift, etc., on the obser-
vation balloon and he states that the object was traveling at such a rate 
of speed as to preclude its being caused by any upper air winds. He 
also stated that the weather conditions at the time were clear with 
visibility unlimited. He further stated that the object was traveling 
in the opposite direction to all prevailing winds, as indicated by the 
drift of the observation balloon. 

4. Checks with the Electronics and Atmospheric Research Section, 
Holloman AFB, Weather Stations at Holloman AFB and White Sands Proving 
Ground, and the Technical Division at White Sands Proving Ground, revealed 
that no testing devices were sent aloft which could have been mistaken 
for the object in question. All these agencies also stated that there 
had been no unusual radar sightings.

HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE, New Mexico
14 October 1949

On 11 October 1949, at approximately 1100 hours, I was located
at Ryan #4 Site, at HAFB, as a member of a balloon launching and tracking
crew. We had launched a balloon flight and were tracking the flight
with a Theodolite. Sgt. MARION H. GRAVES was tracking with the Theo-
dolite and I was engaged in recording Azimuth and Elevation angles.
I happened to peer into the sky to the Northwest and observed a white
object moving at a high rate of speed. This object appeared to move
in a straight path and disappeared from view to the Southeast in approx-
imately 10 to 15 seconds. This object appeared to be moving at a
greater speed than any object I have ever observed, with the exception
of a falling star.

DETAILS:

1. Investigation requested by OSI, Hq. to ascertain facts surrounding
the sighting of an unidentified object sighted over Davis-Monthan AFB at 1340
hours MST, 12 October 1949.

                        AT DAVIS-MONTHAN AFB

2. On 14 October 1949, 1st Lt DAVID J. LANTZ, AO-771912, Bombardier,
65th Bomb Sq, 43rd Bomb Gp was interviewed. LANTZ stated that on 12 October
1949 at about 1340 hours MST, while standing in the 65th Bomb Sq aircraft
parking area in the company of three airmen, his attention was drawn to an
object which appeared to be about 25,000 to 30,000 feet overhead. LANTZ
described the object as being round, metallic in substance, white or silver in
color with an approximate diameter of from fifty (50) to one hundred (100)
feet. LANTZ stated that the object was traveling from Northeast (200°) toward
Southwest (210°) and at an excess flying rate of speed, possibly as much as one
thousand (1,000) miles an hour. LANTZ observed the object for about 15 seconds
at which time his attention was distracted by the launching of a weather
balloon over Davis-Monthan AFB. When LANTZ returned his gaze to the portion
of the sky where the object was last seen, the object had disappeared. LANTZ
is of the opinion that the object which he saw, could possibly be an instrument
whose existence is known.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION

On 19 October 1949, Mr. ---------------, American
Meteor Society, w/residence at 504 Vance Street, Wilson, N. C., was interviewed
re: Brilliant Meteor article as reported in the News & Observer newspaper, Raleigh
N. C., on 16 October 1949. Mr. Eason, who has been a meteor observer for the past
22 years, stated that he did not see the meteor in question, but that it was re-
ported to him by Mr. -------------------

Following are the essential points of the -------------- report received from
Mr. Eason by Mr. ------------------------------

On 12 October 1949, at about 11:10 PM, Mr. -------------------- and his wife and son
were sitting in their living room, when Mrs. ------------------ looked out of their living
room window and saw a Fireball coming from a northwest direction and headed in
a southeast direction. She called her husband and son's attention to it. When
first seen, it was about the high of a full moon, red in color, and at an altitude
of 45 degrees. According to Mr. --------------------s approx. figures, it was the size
of a large green in its original path before dipping toward the horizon, it first
skirted and kindled to that of a moon. Stopped in appearing over the horizon, lights
there any sound. The weather was described as clear.

Mr. Eason said that this same Fireball was reported by the ----------------------------
Wilson, N., C., but Mr. ----------------------- was unable to give details.

After the aforementioned article had appeared in the paper, Mr. Eason
received a letter from Mr. --------------------- Dean of History and Political Science, 
N. C., State College, Raleigh, N. C., in which Mr. --------------------- stated on 12 October
1949, between 11:30 and 11:35 PM, he and his ---------------------- were standing on the
front porch of his home facing east when they saw a Fireball coming out of the
south west and headed in a northeast direction. This Fireball was above the size
of a baseball, and seemed to travel parallel to the earth's surface. After a 
long and fiery flight, it broke into 2 or 3 pieces, and quitely disappeared.

Mr. Eason stated that from all the reports he had received there has
become a regular epidemic of Fireballs in the North Carolina area since September.
He said that he did not keep those reports on hand but send them to Dr. Charles
P. Olivier, President, of ---------------------- and Director of the Flower
Observatory, University of Pennsylvania, Upper Darby, Pa., from whom copies of
them may be obtained upon request to him, Dr. Olivier.

When Mr. Eason received a report from someone that they saw a Meteor or
Fireball or any unusual event in the sky, he sends them a blank copy
which he attended, to fill out and return to him. Mr. Eason said that in the
future, as would send this office a copy of all reports recieved by him on the
aforementioned phenomenon.                                        (T-2)

substance as follows:
On 12 October 1949, between 11:10 and 11:15 PM, while Mr. ████████
myself were standing on the front porch of my home about 2½ miles southeast of
Garner, N. C., we saw a brilliant meteor, which was a blue-white in color, travel-
ing across the sky parallel to the earth's surface in a north-northeast direction.
I would judge its height as about between 15,000 and 18,000 feet or approximato-
ly 3-5 degree. It a/h very short trail, and did not emit any sound that we
could hear. We were facing east at the time, and just as we turned our head to
the loff to follow it, it broke into 2 distinct pieces, possibly three, and then
without describint an arc, or very small one at best, it quietly disappeared.
Except for the fact that it traveled parallel to the earth's surface, and that
it broke into pieces, I have no reason to boliove that it was other than a tell-
ing star.

On 20 October 1949, Mr. █████████████, Associate Editor, North Carolina
Education Magazine, w/office above Colonial Stores on Morgan Street, Raleigh, N.C,
was interviewed regarding aforementioned event. Mr. █████████ substantiated what
Mr. █████ said and added that he had never heard of a meteor traveling parallel
to the earth's surface.

A very brilliant meteor or fireball is reported to have passed in your vicinity on ------------ at the hour of ------------ Will you please answer as fully as possible the following questions, which are asked on behalf of the American Meteor Society in order that permanent records of such phenomena may be obtained. When these reports are published each contributor whose report is fairly complete will be mentioned, if possible, by name and due credit given. It is only by the help of those who can give personal information that data can be secured for the computation of the orbits of meteors. These data are of great scientific value and all reasonable efforts should be made to obtain them. You will be unable probably to answer all questions below, but answer those you can, as they may be of the greatest importance. Fill in replies in blank spaces left and enclose an additional sheet with any further comments or description if you need more space. Complete instructions are given at the end of the question. Please read them all before attempting to write any answer. Detach and keep the second sheet for future use.

(1) Give your name and address.

(2) Where were you when you saw the meteor?
(If the town is small please give county as well.)

(3) Give the date, hour and minute when the meteor appeared; also kind of time used.

(4) In what direction did it appear (or in what direction was it first seen)?
This is not asking in what direction it was going!

(5) In what direction did it disappear (or in what direction was it last seen)?
For questions 4 and 5, simply N, E, S, or W is not accurate enough, unless these were the exact directions.
If compass is used, state it; also if magnetic correction has been applied to compass reading.

(6) At what height did it appear? (Use degrees in answering.)

(7) At what height did it disappear? (Use degrees in answering.)

(8) Did it pass directly overhead (i.e., through the zenith)?

(9) If not, to which side of the zenith did it go, and how far from it? (Use degrees in answering.)

ANNUAL METEOR SHOWERS

For the information of the casual observer the following
data concerning the principal annual meteor showers are given.
For leap years the dates should be one day earlier than those
listed here. All dates are those of the evening on which the
maximum is due, even though the shower appears after midnight
and therefore on the next calendar date. For the average year

the Perseids are the richest stream, followed in order by the
Geminids and Orionids. The American Meteor Society is
always glad to receive accurate hourly counts of meteors
made by one person on any of the nights when annual streams
are active, or, for that matter, on any clear night whatever.

Detach this sheet and keep it for future use!

Occasionally at night and less often by day a person has
the good fortune to see a great meteor or fireball. As the
number seen in the average lifetime is very small, great pains
should be taken to make as accurate observations as possible.
We must have the observer's name, the place from which the
object was seen (the position of the observer's station must be
given as exactly as he can find it, i.e., to within a mile if
possible), and the hour and minute when the object appeared.
Even for the fireball itself, the fundamental data are the points
in the sky at which it appeared, and the point at which it dis-
appeared. If it was seen at night, and the observer knows
the constellations, these points can at once be described ac-
curately with regard to neighboring stars. If, as usual, the
person seeing the fireball does not know any stars or constella-
tions, the beginning and end points can be fixed only by their
directions and their angular heights above the horizon. Every-
one knows what is meant by directions, but few can fix them
accurately. However, particularly with the observer in a
familiar place, he can fix the points if he regards trees, poles,
houses, etc. Then with the help of a friend who can determine
angles, he can measure off the directions and altitudes quite
simply. If no such friend is available, the best thing to do is to
use a compass or if possible to check up the directions from
some map of the surrounding territory. As for altitudes, it is
90 degrees from the horizon to the zenith; hence one must
make the best estimate of what part of 90 degrees each of the
two altitudes is. The Pointers of the Big Dipper are five de-
grees apart; the 'Belt of Orion" in three degrees long. Either
will help in estimating a distance in degrees.

Warning should be here given that the use of miles, yards,
feet, or inches to describe the heights or lengths of paths of
meteors or fireballs has no possible meaning and the words are
wasted. As a check on the direction of the path, it is always
useful to give the angle of the path—in degrees, or by a dia-
gram—with the horizon, of course saying which way the meteor
was going. The object's size should be compared with that of
the full Moon or some planet or bright star. Here again the
use of "inches" in describing diameters has absolutely no mean-
ing, nor has the comparison of the meteor with balls or fruit.
If possible, the duration of flight should be estimated in seconds,
and if an explosion is seen, one should time carefully how many
minutes or seconds elapse before it is heard. This is an excel-
lent check on other observations.

If the object is seen in daylight, exactly the same notes
should be made, except that here it is impossible to use the
stars as reference points. In all cases additional notes as to
color, trains left, peculiar motion, etc., are useful.

A report which has only part of the desired data may be
very valuable; please send us everything noted about the fire-
ball, whether it is much or little. Your observations may in-
clude just the one point lacking in reports from other people,
and so may make possible a solution of the height and orbit.

If a long-enduring train remains after meteor has dis-
appeared, the direction in which this drifts and its changes of
shape should be carefully noted, say at one minute intervals,
if it lasts this long. In any case, all drifts are of the greatest
importance for studies of the upper atmosphere.

2 March 1948

Mr. Oscar Monnig
Secretary, National Meteorological Society
Fort Worth, Texas

Dear Sir:

I was acquainted with you some 16 years ago when I was a member of 
the Pentac Society under the direction of Mrs ____ of old Central High 
School. You were lecturing and holding star observation meetings at 
that time. I am writing this introductory letter as a personal note
rather than as an official piece of correspondence. I am requesting
that you keep the subject matter confidential, and assure you that any
correspondence you address to this Headquarters will be held in absolute
confidence. Please address reply to 

Commanding General
Air Material Command
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio
ATTN: Major M. W. Faulk (MCIA)

I am interested in the sighting of a supposed meteorite over Kansas
about two weeks ago. I gather from a news article that you will have
information regarding any fragments from this object. If you have knowl-
edge of the existence of these fragments, or of any technical information
concerning the meteorite, please write us and give the details. I plan
to be in Fort Worth for a visit to my home during the week end of 13 March
1948 and I will appreciate an interview with you at that time.

Remembering with pleasure your cooperation with our group of high
school students, I feel sure that you will respect my request that there
be no publicity concerning this investigation and that you will give us
whatever information is available to you.

Sincerely yours,

UNCLAS- (File 201-)

CLIPPING TAKEN FROM SALINA, KANSAS, JOURNAL
DATED 24 OCTOBER 1949

FLYING DISCS ARE CLAIMED SIGHTED
IN DOWNS VICINITY

DOWNS - Two Downs men, and , have joined the ranks
of those who claim to have seen flying
discs.
The men were working in a field at
the Verhage farm when they heard a B-29
pass overhead. The big bomber was head-
ing almost due west at a height Verhage
and Latham estimate at 6000 to 7000 feet.
    They say that as they watched the
plane a huge bright disc suddenly appeared,
sailing from southwest to northwest and
directly in the path of the plane but about
500 feet below it.
    Verhage and Latham say the speed of the
shining disc was terrific. They think it was
15 to 20 feet in circumference and resembled,
as much as anything else, a huge piece of
bright aluminum.

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch, not a photograph. The sketch appears to illustrate the trajectory or maneuvers of an object, probably in reference to a UFO sighting. It shows arrows indicating the direction of movement and curved lines suggesting changes in direction. At the bottom right, there is a drawing of an aircraft with "B-29" written on the side. Additionally, there are cardinal direction indicators (N, S, E, W) with an additional "NW" indicating northwest.

wife, Mrs , had observed seven (7) unidentified objects at
Wind [ ] Pass, Florida.

2. At approximately 1702Z hours 14 Octohor 1949, Mrs
was tending on the beach approximately one (1) mile south of Lovie Inlet Beach
Bridge, Daytone Beach, Florida. As Lovie Inlet parking area come within sight
she turned and looked toward the horison, at which time her attention was imme-
diately attracted by objects.

3. The objects were seen well (7) in number, and shaped on the top as a
inverted near shallow (15) normal intervals, each about a(t)c in diameter. to 6
inches in height. The middle pert, 2 1/2 inches in diameter, was rough to
reflect sunlight. Material surface "in" bright. (Material appears to be
near even in there to four inches deep, and when a perspective angle is
achieved, from 60 horizontal, objects appeared smooth beneath the burrs,
then flg lt in width till disappeared from view.

4. The objects appeared to whirl as a revolving'a at a (2) condition.
First saw (7) objects on parallel line, with color blue to white.
The objects continued to parallel itself in a line of white puff dispersal - out
to the crust. The formation pushed water disturbance of about 5 to 6 feet
those that appeared to be cloth-like which was laid over to a platter
to regular intervals; 80 to 85 feet, 5 following 7. Objects appeared to
vibrate quite stiffly after the initial point, became steady except for
rotatory spin was with a increased to the horiains, and lift of all 7, was
observed from point south of the viewpoint.

5. To round, exhaust, smoke vapor trail, or smell detected. And f
ejicted to from 50 to 60 miles per hour. Course of movement was ap-
proximately forty 80 degrees over the ATLANTIC, and sisappeared when objects
duly strait the observer's vision. The estimation of objects renewal is a
diameter of two exhaust area three times as reported, or nearly a 6 to 9 feet
of area with noise one third as large as a 747K "on a very clear visibility.
There were no visible exhaust or jet openings. Control skill quality is not known.

6. Report for the government section of the object, which appeared to two red
stripes separated by colorless; the remainder of the objects was solid black.

7. The Following information is relative to the observer. Name, age, 
occupation. Conservative. American Hostility, true. Literacy, correspondent 
school. Record of novelar objects: Poor. Size at distance: Poor. "Related Story-
of observer": Unknown. Instance: None. No comparisons can be made on similarity, 
voice and character or No; therefore no the information was made by him to Insure,
and information received this Headquarters from F .

8. This officer thinks thin objects sited were probably jet drones with
exceptionally large wing tanks.

DETAILS                                   UNCLASSIFIED

1. This investigation was requested by District Commander,
1st OSI District.

AT MANCHESTER. NEW HAMPSHIRE

2. This is a joint investigation of Special Agent ROOS: S.
MACDONALD and the writer.

3. On 20 October 1949, at approximately 1750 hours, an un-
identified, unconventional aircraft was sighted by ****** ****** at
the intersection of Tanjert, N. H., while sitting in an automobile at
N. H. Only one unidentified object was observed, and no celestial
phenomena were known to have taken place at that time. Object was
sighted over an area about 15 miles west of Hooksett, New Hampshire
according to ******. This attention was first drawn to the object
by an apparent explosion and a visible ball of flame.

4. ****** stated that the object was approximately 15 to
20 miles northwest from his point of observation. At the time he
noticed it, the missile had just burst into flames of a white color
and was at an altitude of about 3500 to 4000 feet. The object seemed
to be diving straight down and was in ********** sight for about 15 or
20 seconds.

5. ****** could not describe the shape or color of the
object since it was in flames when he first saw it. There were no
identifiable protrusions, and nothing else was visible except the
above mentioned flames.

6. ****** stated that he would estimate the speed of the
diving object to be equal or in excess of that of a jet aircraft.

7. ****** could give no information as to sound, stating
that because of his distance from the object he did not believe he
could have heard it. The object disappeared out of view behind a
hill, but a bright red glow could be seen from the approximate loca-
tion where the object landed. The red glow seemed to come from a
localized area and expanded upward into a large area.

8. ****** is at present employed as an electric motor winder, working
for his father at ****** Motor Company, Manchester, New Hamp-
shire, and likes to work on scientific problems. During the
war ****** was assigned to a radar outfit in the Pacific as a radar
technician.

---
9. _______ , Manchester, New Hampshire, whose father, who was inside a house when the object fell but came out when called, noticed a bright red glow about 15 or 20 miles in a northwest direction from where he was standing.

10. The search and early warning radar net of the 647th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Grenier Air Force Base, N. H., was inoperative at the time the object was sighted. No radar information was available on 20 October 1949.

11. Captain ______ , NL4665A, Base Operations Officer, Grenier Air Force Base, was contacted by base and advised of the incident. ETICAM informed the New Hampshire State Police and then led a search crew to the area in an effort to locate the scene where the object had fallen but the search was unsuccessful.

12. Captain ______ , SAULSBERR JR, RQ-761625, Grenier Air Force Base, Ill., was alerted to the incident in a C-47 aircraft at the area where the object was sighted. He did locate something burning on the ground, but it was later found that he had spotted a burning refuse dump.

13. Extensive inquiry has been made among the residents in the area, where the object was last observed in an effort to locate other witnesses, but to date none have been found nor have any remains of the object been located.

14. Interviews were conducted with the representatives of the Civil Aeronautics Administration and the New Hampshire State Aeronautics Commission, both of Concord, near Manchester Airport. The following airports and flying services were also contacted:

    Martin's Flying Services and Fern's Flying Service, both of Concord, N. H. Airport; and Bylado Flying Service, Hooksett, N. H.

None of these interviewees had seen or received reports of any unconventional aircraft in the vicinity. There were no FIL hits of scheduled airlines, private or military aircraft in the air at the time of the incident.

15. Upon request of this office, Captain J. E. WILLIAMSON, AQ-667719, 6th Rescue Squadron, Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts, made a reconnaissance of the vicinity but was unable to locate any evidence of a burned out area.

16. It will be noted that the area over which the object was believed to have exploded is in the same general area of the incident reported by Special Agent GERALD H. RUSSELL, File No. 24-422, dated 7 October 1949. It will also be noted that in both cases those objects were sighted on the twentieth day of the month by persons not connected in any way.

I, ________________________________, Manchester, N. H., prior
to making the statement contained in the following paragraphs have
been told by HAROLD H. BURNEY, who has identified himself to me as
a Special Agent of the Office of Special Investigations, USAF, that
I do not have to make any statement, and in any statement I may
make may be used against me in a court of law. I have also been in-
formed of my right to have an attorney. With such understanding, I
make the following statement of my own free will and accord, without
threat or fear of punishment and without inducement or promise of
immunity or reward.

On 20 October 1949, at approximately 1750 hours, while sitting
in an automobile at the intersection of Zagerdt Street and Gorefastown
Road, Manchester, New Hampshire, I happened to look in a Northwest
direction and saw an object explode in flames. The color of the flames
was white. I did not know what direction the object had been going in
until I saw this ball of flame. It then appeared to be falling straight
down, although at the distance that I was from it, which was about 15 to
20 miles, it could have been falling at an angle. I have seen jet air-
craft from time to time and this object seemed to be falling at about
the same speed or a little faster than a jet plane would go. I could
not distinguish any smoke or exhaust about the object when it was fall-
ing. When the object hit the ground, which was out of my visden, I
noticed a bright red flame come from the area where it had fallen. This
flame burned for about 20 to 25 minutes. I did not notice any protrus-
ions on the object nor did I see any lights. or small any odor or hear
any noise from it.

I had been working about eight hours on this day but was not tired
or felt any undue fatigue. I had a full night's sleep the night before
and I do not drink intoxicating liquors.

My father, ___________________, Manchester, N. H.,
did not see the object burst into flames but when I called him out of
the house he did see the bright red glow of the object burning on the
ground.

I have read this statement consisting of one page and it has been
read to me. I have signed and initialled all corrections. This state-
ment is the truth to the best of my knowledge and belief and I have
given it freely and voluntarily.

STATEMENT OF [REDACTED]

On 20 October 1949 between 1830 and 1845, [REDACTED] and I were on the way home from work. We were driving North on Hartland Road, north of Route 104, approximately three (3) miles from Lockport, in Hartland County, when I saw a blue light which appeared to be about the size of a wing tip light on an aircraft. It was traveling from east to west, in level flight, with no deviation in altitude or course. The light was in sight for from five to eight seconds, and covered an estimated five miles. Although it was a quiet evening, were not able to hear any unusual sound, even after stopping the car and getting out. While it was impossible to accurately judge altitude or distance I would say that a comparison could be made to the wing tip light of an aircraft at an altitude of five hundred (500) feet, distance of one (1) mile, and estimated speed of one thousand (1000) MPH. There were no trailing sparks or evidence of any type of propellant such as in a rocket or jet. The light disappeared in the same manner as an electric light being turned off. At the instant of disappearance a few orange-red sparks appeared and fell almost immediately.

My first thought was that it was an aircraft until I realized that if it were the running lights would have been reversed, and that I would have seen a red light instead of a blue one. The speed also ruled out the possibility of a conventional type aircraft. I have worked around planes for the past (12) years, have worked on rocket test, on the XS-1, and have seen the North American F 86 flown vide a probe, but have never yet seen anything that approached the speed at which the light was traveling.

I am familiar with the Northern Lights, meteors, and St. Elmo's Fire, none of these could explain the nature of the light that was seen on 20 October.

I have read the foregoing statement, consisting of one (1) page, and it is true and correct, to the best of my knowledge and belief.

_STATEMENT_

I, [name redacted], currently residing at [address redacted], Manchester, N. H., prior to making the statement contained in the following report, hereby have been told by Lt. Col. H. G. Dyer, who has identified himself to me as a Special Agent of the Office of Special Investigations, USAF, that I do not have to make any statement, and that any statement I may make may be used against me in a court of law. I have also been informed of my right to have an attorney. With such understanding, I make the following statement of my own free will and accord, without threat or fear of punishment and without inducement or promises of immunity or reward.

On 20 October 1949, at approximately 1750 hours, while sitting in an automobile at the intersection of Forest Street and Jeffoatown Road, Manchester, New Hampshire, I happened to look in a Northwestern direction and saw an object explode in flames. The color of the flames was white. I did not know what direction the object had come from or until I saw this ball of flame. It then appeared to be falling straight down, although at a distance. If it was falling, it was falling over 20 miles, it could have been falling at an engine. I have seen jet aircraft from time to time and this object seemed to be moving about the same speed or a little faster than a jet plane would go. I could not distinguish any noise or exhaust about the object when it was falling. When the object hit the ground, which was out of my vision, I noticed a bright red flame come from the area where it had fallen. This flame burned for about 20 to 25 minutes. I did not notice any protrusions on the object nor did I see any lights or small any odor or hear any noise from it.

I had been working about eight hours on this day but was not tired or felt any undue fatigue. I had a full night's sleep the night before and I do not drink intoxicating liquors.

My father, [text missing], saw the object burst into flames but when I called him out of the house he did see the bright red glow of the object burning on the ground.

I have read this statement consisting of one page and it has been read to me. I have signed and initialized all corrections. This statement is the truth to the best of my knowledge and belief and I have given it freely and voluntarily.

Sgt.  is a former Army Air Force Navigator who has had experi-
ence in celestial navigation. He states that in his opinion it was im-
probable that the object photographed could have been a celestial body.
He felt that possibly it was a recognition or some light mounted on some
man-made structure in the distance until he searched the entire area to
the southwest of the position of his camera the following day and could
not find anything to bear out his opinion. He states the distance from
him is unknown by him in that it could have been one-half mile, 20 miles
or many, many miles away. The camera used was a Speedgraphic camera
mounted on a tripod set on F 4.5 and infinity with an exposure of 30
seconds. The row of lights visible to the left of the unknown object
are said by  to have been a car traveling from right to left befor
the camera which is thought by  to have been approximately two
blocks in the distance. To his naked eye the unknown object appeared
brighter than the automobile headlights but definitely much smaller.
Jones states the reason no stars are visible in the picture is that he
developed the print specifically to bring out the object in question.
with reference to the slight fuzziness appearing from eight to twelve
o'clock and from two to six o'clock on the edge of the object, 
states that his tripod and camera were quite securely mounted and he is
certain no movement of the camera would account for this a fore-mentioned
fuzziness on the image. The Base Photo Officer feels that the fuzziness
may be traceable to heat emitted by the object. The only negative and
prints made of this object are herewith inclosed and number "1" on the
rear of said prints. Knowing there to be a bright star in the sky in
that approximate direction at that approximate time the writer requested
that Jones make a picture of this and other stars the night of 24 October

1949. [REDACTED] accomplished this and two negatives with their respective prints are inclosed herewith and the prints are numbered "2I" and "2A".

On 25 October 1949 at 1300 hours the writer, accompanied by Sgt [REDACTED] and Captain [REDACTED] who is the Base Photography Officer, went to the exact location where Jones had mounted his tripod previously. [REDACTED] shot three pictures on approximately 2450, 2400 and 2350, respectively. [REDACTED] states that the automobile lights visible in picture No. "I" were moving on a road which runs before the houses shown in the left part of picture No. "3A" and "3B". The writer on 25 October 1949 personally inspected the area from 1800 to 2700 up to five miles away from the position of the cameraman and searched said area also with a pair of binoculars and could find no man-made structure which would account for this light appearing in the position and the angle that it does. The distance of the light above the automobile headlights appears greater than would allow it to have been suspended or attached by any object attached or anchored to the ground to the southwest and detected by the cameraman.

The image you have provided appears to show two separate frames potentially from a document or report. The upper frame contains an object, possibly a round or oval shape, which might be a photograph or illustration, but the quality is not clear enough to describe the content accurately. The lower frame appears to be a darkened strip, possibly a poorly reproduced photograph or a copy of a horizon line or landscape; however, the details are also unclear. The only distinguishable text between these two frames reads:

UNCLASSIFIED

There is no additional visible text to transcribe from this image due to its poor quality and lack of clear, legible content.

- page 116 -

The image contains two rectangular frames, resembling placeholders for photographs. The upper rectangle appears empty without a photograph, while the lower rectangle contains a blurred image that looks like a landscape or horizon line, but it's quite unclear.

Below the lower image, the text reads:
UNCLASSIFIED

- page 117 -

The image contains three empty rectangular frames or placeholders where photographs might be expected, but no actual photographs are visible within these frames. Two of the frames have the word "UNCLASSIFIED" written beneath them. There is no other text that I can decipher from this image.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image contains a handwritten letter. Here is the text transcribed from the document:

July 6, 1952

Capt. Ruppelt
A.T.I.C
Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Capt. Ruppelt:
On Sat. July 5 I spoke at length in your Duty Officer Capt. James about another matter. Might possibly join with him and promised to send in a complete report including status etc. When I returned to Pittsburgh this article was in the morning paper. It was less of a report to compete so I'm sending it on ahead. My idea of a visible prop. saucer may be off the beam but it seems worth mentioning.

Sincerely,
[Redacted Signature]
Pittsburgh, Pa.

The image provided does not contain any photographs, it appears to be a scanned page of a handwritten document. Due to the poor quality and handwriting, the text is somewhat unclear. Here's the closest transcription I can make out:

```

```

The writing is not fully legible, and some words are either cut off or too obscured to be confidently transcribed. The metadata suggests that this page is from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book in the 1940s. However, precise transcription is limited by the legibility of the handwriting and the quality of the scanned document.

- page 133 -

The image contains a sketch, not a photograph. The sketch appears to depict some sort of craft with annotations describing its features or motion. There are also handwritten notes.

Here's the text as an OCR system might output:

---
direction of 
no noise etc.

Given that no drawing nor 
narrative description can be 
considered accurate this is as close 
a description of the object as I can
get not having seen it personally 

[Two sketches of a craft with annotations "band(s)" and "dome on unit"]

The annotated moving picture clips 
and [indiscernible] of other data. The [indiscernible] 
mentioned looks very logical —

[Text is cut off and not fully readable]

[handwriting unclear]
[signature-like scribble]

Please note that due to the quality of the handwriting in the original document and the scan's resolution, some text could not be accurately transcribed, and parts of the text are indiscernible or cut off.
