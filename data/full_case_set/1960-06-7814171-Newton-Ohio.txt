Very slowly
Very bright object color white, then green and white. One side had finger-like projections. Larger than stars and occasional round and disappeared.

The object responsible for this sighting was probably an unidentified aerial phenomenon. Its characteristics, such as color changes and finger-like projections, are not typical of known aircraft or celestial objects. The witness's description indicates it was a very bright, unusual object that exhibited unconventional behavior. However, without further evidence or investigation, a definitive identification could not be made.

There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document with text describing an apparent UFO sighting.

Transcribed text from the document:

The celestial object was observed by 3 individuals at approximately 8:20 PM, March 17, 1960 over the Newton, Ohio area. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes and described as circular in shape, having a red light at the front, and white lights at the rear. The object appeared to be approximately 20 feet in diameter and was moving at a high rate of speed, estimated to be 300 to 500 miles per hour. The object was observed to make a slight course change and then descend rapidly until it disappeared from sight. The investigators were unable to determine the exact nature of the object, but it was not identified as any known aircraft.

No Case (Information Only)
June 1960 
England

An incident, EVIDENTALLY of LANDING a LARGE object in ENGLAND, recently came to the attention of Project BLUE BOOK through an investigator in England. Mr. Bill (?) Edwards was talking to an elderly man who lived near the scene of the incident and who claimed to have seen a bright light descending over his field the night of 25 May I960. This same man saw an object land in a field about a quarter of a mile away, and put out a bright light. The object then rose again, at which time the man could distinguish one could two individuals on board through what seemed to be a transparent window.

The width of the imprint was about 25 feet, and the inner one is 7 feet across. The object then rose and went away. The witnesses reported that they were "caused by a large heavy circular object which had landed", and the effects were still visible on the ground.

In investigating, it was found that a fresh crop of horse mushrooms had grown in this area, and that the field in question is about a half mile in diameter. There were no other unusual signs or markings. Edwards had been to the site a day previously, and had found no evidence of any other 'landing'. Continuing, the report states that this case is still being investigated, but that it would seem to be an isolated incident; and that no other unusual occurrences were reported in this area during this period.

June 23, 1960, 0430 EDST, Newton, Ohio. Witnessed by a New York UFO Investigator, who was present on a field trip with a group of students. They observed a light come out of the northern sky, descend to about 100-150 feet, make a 90 degree turn and then accelerate rapidly out of sight to the west. The light was oval-shaped and seemed to be about 30 feet in diameter. It gave off a soft luminous glow and did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion. The sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds.

BERMUDA

Several residents of Bermuda on the night of 24 June 1960, saw an aerial object pass over Bermuda. It was bright and appeared to be round, about 20 feet in diameter. The object appeared to be hovering and then shoot away at an extremely high rate of speed. The object was traveling very fast, emitted no sound, and left no trail. The witnesses reported that as the object came within a mile, it appeared to be shaped like a "toms" bomb, but made no noise as it passed over the ground. The UFO was traveling very fast.

30 June 1960
Martin, Tennessee

To several stars - at the past few years, a circle appeared repeatedly on the ground, covered with grass, at various farms in the area. Miss Josephine Damron, who lived with her father and brother near Martin, Tennessee, told her neighbors that such circles had appeared in her field several times, the largest being about six yards in circumference. A flash of light accompanied the appearance of the circle and upon investigation she found that the grass within the circle was flattened, but not cut. In the center of the circle was a slight depression, about six inches deep and twelve inches across. Examination revealed no signs of digging or disturbance of the soil, and no trace of anything that might have caused the phenomenon. Subsequent appearances of the circle seemed to indicate that some invisible force emanating from a central point had pressed down the grass in a circular pattern, radiating outward. Although several other persons claimed to have observed the same phenomenon in the vicinity, Miss Damron's account is the only detailed report available. Since none have been explained, the cases remain somewhat puzzling.

The image provided appears to contain two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch depicts a curved line to show how high an object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it. The second sketch shows two smaller sketches, one of a road with buildings and trees on the sides, and another of a person standing in a landscape with hills or mountains in the background.

OCR text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
