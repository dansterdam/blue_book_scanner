Incident #32 -- Oslo, Norway -- 12 December 1947

The object observed here answers the description of a fireball, and the probability that it actually was one is very great.

1. It is requested that the employee of the Office, CAA, Oslo, Norway, be 
interrogated as to the "falling stars" one observed the night of 13 December 1947.

2. The attached form which is to be forwarded as an inclosure to the letter to 
the said should be filled out by the witness and thus accompanied by a signed statement 
as detailed and accurate as possible should be returned this office.

3. Should any other phenomena be observed the questions itemized could form the 
basis of future reports. Any comments by qualified personnel - particularly from the 
University of Oslo - both in regard to the incidents of 12 and 13th Dec and any possible 
future phenomena would prove most helpful.

On the night of 12 Dec 47 at 2205, the 16-year old daughter of the [obscured] Oslo, Norway, perceived what appeared to be a falling star. Description of the brightness suggested by the origin and declinations of [obscured] 13 is as follows: The object which appeared unusually bright in comparison to other falling stars the witness had observed, traveled from right to left on the arc of a circle, the curvature of which was very great. Deductions by the MC placed its course just within the atmosphere. In this, the intensity which it somewhere within its arc greenish-yellow tail of long instantly remained in sight for some two or three seconds when it was obscured by trees bordering the driveway.
The witness saw no other falling stars, There was no noise or smell, the night was clear and star-lit.

[obscured] states the University Observatory at Oslo had no record of this; however, an employee of OMA, Oslo, reported that on 13 Dec 47 he had observed an unusual number of falling stars. The MC makes two observations which are of interest, i.e., (1) The objects are apparently traveling slower than (2) the speed or they would be discernible to many more people, and (2) the time of burning of the objects while under observation seems to be just a few seconds.
