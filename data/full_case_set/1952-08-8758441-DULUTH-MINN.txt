10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING

Observer was tracking balloon by theodolite when he discovered a small object
in the sky which he observed for two minutes. Observer could not locate the object again
after adjusting theodolite to check on pilot balloon. Object was not moving. Had
appearance of bright spot of sunlight.

(Circle One): Yes or No

29.1 If you answered YES, did they see the object too?

(Circle One): Yes or No

29.2 Please list their names and addresses:

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important. Use additional sheets of the same size paper it necessary.

Since I have taken pilot balloon observations for 20 years
I know that the phenomenon was not one usually
observed. The position did not change in the theodolite
for a full minute. With respect to movement this
leaves three possibilities for that minute: 1- The object
did not move; 2- The object climbed at 2200 above the horizontal
in the direction at 227.3' 3 - The object descended at 2200 above
the horizontal in the direction at 227.3'

Since moving the theodolite caused the object to move
across the field of vision it probably could not have
been caused by any defect in the instrument

w =Amm diah, Minnesota, August 8, 1952.

REPORT BY U- S. WEATHER BUREAU METEOROLOGIST OF LIGHT SEEN IN PILOT BALLOON OBSERVATION THEODOLITE.

During the rr-galar aftetncon plio: balloon observation taken en August 7, 1952, a small bright light appeared in the theodolite. The light an viewed in the theodolite eyepiece was approximately one twentieth inch long and aboit half as high ac air- long. Ite third dimension could not be observed. Its color was the color of suntieht I do not know when the light moved into, or criginate on, the field of vieion. Due to its small sini it was noticed only by acuidente

In following the drift of the balloon the movement of the theodclite caused the small bright light to move ta the edge of the field of vision. Since I wanted to keep the light in the field of vision I let the balloon pass out cf the field and I brought the small bright light back to the ceater of the field. There appeared to be no movement of the light during the minute when I had it centered in the theodolite vield. Its azimath angle rounded at 237.5 degrees, and the elevation angle ae 22,0 degrees.

i have rs ectinste to give concerning the actual size of the object, ur of its distance frem this station.

In attempting to fulfill ny purpose of observing (the pilot balloon) I goved the theodclite to the position where I expected to find the balloon. Then I iThnediately noved it back to 237.5 azimuth and 22.0 degrees elevation. However; I then could not find the light. I nctuslly observed the light for sorowhat nore than two minutes from 1505 to 1508 CST.

Winds aloft computed from this observation, given in thousands of feet MSL, degrees from North, and in knots mere; 2-00-7, 2-220-10, 1-2io-12, 1-250-10, 2520-10, 7-250-5, 2-610-2, 2-520-23, 1-2 20-12, 1-220-12, 15-20-15, 130-25-15,

I do not know wthether this light was reflected from some object, or if it had its own source of light. The light was shimmering and bright, but not dannling. 1t was bright enough so that I could not dafine its borders.

Since noving the theodolite caused the light to move across the field of vision I know that the light was not caused by any flaw in any part of the instrument.

No publicity vas given the observing of this phenomenon.

The photograph in the document consists of a hand-drawn illustration. The illustration shows a circular object with a diameter of approximately 1/20 inch drawn. The accompanying text indicates the following information: "Object was bright enough so that its borders could not be defined. No movement visible." The size dimensions are stated to be as seen in the theodolite and magnified thereby.
