Mrs. Hunt/man/SAFOUCD/7832/14 Sep 65
Dear Mr. [Redacted],
Your observation as a satellite, the night of 15 August 1965 has been evaluated by this office. The information you have submitted indicates that the object you observed was not a satellite, but rather an unidentifiable object the nature of which could cause anomalous temperature inversion which would cause the object to appear to have such movement.

Sincerely,
JOHN T. SPALDING
Lt Colonel, USAF
