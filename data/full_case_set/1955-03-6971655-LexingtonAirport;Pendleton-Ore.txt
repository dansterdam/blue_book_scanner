5. PHOTOS C Yes

8. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING Two (2) round, bright crimson objects seen maneuvering, seemed to disappear over the horizon heading East. Both objects seemed to disappear over the horizon heading East. Both objects were very bright and seemed to be traveling at a high rate of speed. Observers: military pilots.
11. COMMENTS Did the fact that this sighting took place within a period of two minutes indicate that the objects were probably real? Completely erratic, except for moving in a line that seemed to fill most of the requirements. A possibility of seeming the local airport beacon.
