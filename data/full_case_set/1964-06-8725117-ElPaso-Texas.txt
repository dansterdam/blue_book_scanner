REFERENCE the attached letter from ( ...  ) requesting information on an unidentified flying object on 25 JUN 64, El Paso, TEXAS.
1. The above sighting was investigated by the 916th Bombardment Wing (L) Detachment 4, Biggs Air Force Base, Texas, and a report of the findings was forwarded to the project officer at ATIC prior to the sighting. Enclosed with the letter was the full description of the sighting.
2. The film was forwarded to Dallas, Texas for processing, although it was considered that probably nothing unusual would be found. This conjecture was proved correct, as the film showed nothing but clouds.
3. The witness's first description of "a silvery disc-shaped cone's ascension" by two highly regarded citizens accords with the balloon and its ascension in air. This case is considered closed as a balloon observation.

The text in the document is as follows:

Dear Mr. -
Reference is made to your letter of January 27, 1965, requesting information on a film in our possession noticing a UFO sighting on 18 June 1964 near El Paso, Texas.

This report was investigated by personnel from Biggs AFB, Texas. Information obtained by the investigating officer indicated that no film of the reported sighting was available.

The case was analyzed and the report submitted with the findings, however, as the officer stated, no film was available either from the individuals concerned or from any other source.

Sincerely,

Transcribed text:

These people report another flying disc over El Paso. Texas, on approximately April 3, 1964 at approx. 11:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. on April 4, 1964.

The object was described as bright, round, clear, about 50 to 100 feet in diameter and hovered over a desert area about 5 to 10 miles from El Paso, Texas. The object emitted no sound and remained stationary for about 1 hour.

Several witnesses saw the object, including a Mr. and Mrs. Charles Smith, who live in a remote area about 10 miles from El Paso, Texas. They observed the object through field glasses and stated that it hovered silently and emitted no light. They watched it for over an hour.

My suggestion would be to contact the witnesses, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Smith, to verify the details of their observation. This may provide additional information regarding the sighting.

Sincerely,
Redacted Name

1. Enclosed is the attached letter from Mr William B. Hassell of El Paso, Texas, transmitting information on an unidentified flying object on 29 June 64, at El Paso, Texas.

2. The above sighting was investigated by the 25th Bombardment Wing, and the report indicated that the object in question was first observed at El Paso, Texas, and tracked on radar by an FAA station and the El Paso Air Force Base. The object proceeded in an easterly direction.

3. The film was forwarded to Dallas, Texas for processing. Although the film contained blurred images, it was determined that the object was not sufficiently defined to be considered an authentic UFO sighting.

4. The film was examined by the Photographic Interpretation Laboratory of the Air Force Systems Command, and in the opinion of Jack Spiro, the photographic interpretation specialist, the film did not contain any evidence of an authentic UFO. Therefore, it was decided that the film should be treated as an uncorrelated object and no further investigation was indicated.

5. The vita was a first description of a sighting, although it contained relatively innocuous details, and the photograph was inconclusive with no clear evidence of a structured device. Therefore, this case was considered as a balloon observation.

Texas Boy Gets Photos
Fourteen-year-old Jack Spice, son of Mr. and Mrs. Marvin Spice of El Paso, Texas, on June 25, 1964 when he spotted three circular objects in the northwestern sky about 8:30 p.m. He photographed the objects. The two photographs taken have been forwarded to the proper authorities.

The boy's parents notified the authorities at once. According to the report, the boy claimed he had been photographing the objects with his 35mm camera and when he viewed the film, these two frames were all that showed anything unusual.

Colonel William W. Saunders said that there was nothing that would indicate "something that should not have been there", and that the "objects" were probably caused by processing.

A Pacific electric engineer told Mr. Larsen in a telephone conversation on June 29, 1964 that he had first-hand information that the objects were not unusual and that they appeared to be "something quite easily explained".

This case is still not resolved and the source seems quite confident about the chance in altitude. This case is still not accepted and the source seems quite confident about the chance in altitude. This has not accepted our offer of case analysis.

1. This sighting was investigated by the 6950th Security Squadron, and the results are reported in the attached report.

2. The object was described by the witness as being lenticular in shape, metallic in appearance, and approximately 40 feet in diameter. It was observed hovering for several minutes at an altitude of about 2,000 feet.  

3. The investigation of the film was mostly negative, as stated in the report. The film could have been processed with insufficient care, and the exact nature of the object could not be determined. 

4. Because the investigating officer was satisfied that the object had been definitely identified no further action was made to your office.

El Paso Boy, 14, May Have Films Of Three UFO's
At El Paso, Texas, a 14-year-old boy believes he has filmed three unidentified flying objects. 
The boy, whose name is not given, says he took motion pictures of the three objects on Sunday, June 21. 
He took several pictures which he said showed the objects hovering in the sky. One of them showed two of the objects together, he added.
The youth viewed the objects through a telescope and said they appeared to be circular in shape and shiny. He described them as "dull silver in color."
The boy said he was able to see the objects for about 15 minutes. He added the objects appeared to be going very slowly.
The youth told his parents about the sightings and they in turn notified the Filter Center in El Paso. The Filter Center then notified the Western Air Defense Command Headquarters at Colorado Springs.
We are awaiting information as to whether the films, if developed, will be released for study.

Dear Major Mannf - 
The enclosed material was received from our Flying Saucer Evaluation Office at the time of the El Paso UFO report. The information contained therein appears to be of some significance in view of the fact that several independent observers purportedly saw the phenomena. As you will note from the content of the report, a sighting of some kind was observed from several locations in and around El Paso, Texas, on the evening of June 8, 1964. It would appear that a further investigation into this matter might be warranted.

Respectfully,
[Redacted]
