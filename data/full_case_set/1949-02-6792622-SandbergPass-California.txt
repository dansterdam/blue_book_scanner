1. In compliance with 1st Indorsement to basic letter, File
AMC 360.112, Subject: Information of Unidentified Flying Objects,
dated 1 March 1949, the following report of investigation is sub-
mitted:

a. 1st Lt. ——— , Air Force Reserve Pilot,
stationed with 704th Air Reserve Unit, Fresno State Teachers College,
Fresno, California, was interrogated and submitted a written statement
concerning his observation of an unfamiliar flying object. This ob-
servation was made in the vicinity of Sandberg Pass, forty (40) miles
North of Bakersfield, California, at approximately 20 PST, 25 Feb-
ruary 1949. No other persons were found who had witnessed the flight
of this object. Guide to investigation of unidentified aerial ob-
jects, which was furnished this office by Air Materiel Command, was
used during the interrogation.

b. Lt ——— is a student of Industrial Arts at Fresno State
Teachers College, Fresno, California, appeared to be an earnest young
man, rather quiet and reserved, with no particular aptitude for self-
expression. He is regarded as sober and respectable and enjoys a
good reputation among his associates. In the school. In the opinion
of the Investigating Officer, Lt ——— would have neither the inclina-
tion nor the ability to construct this report in a wild flight of

c. Lt ——— was first interviewed on 22 March 1949. He re-
ported that at the time of the observation he had been seated in the
left pilot's seat of a P-61 aircraft, flying the return leg of a round
robin cross country proficiency flight from Fresno Air Terminal to
Los Angeles and return. The object which he observed was roughly

a B-29 nose. The object was on a heading approximately north to
south and approached Sanders aircraft from 12 o'clock, at which time
he made his first observation. The object disappeared to the rear
of the B-29 Hill and then apparently made a 3600 turn around it as ****
made his second observation approximately fifteen (15) seconds later
when the object appeared to him right and made a 1800 turn in front of
him, again disappearing to the rear. The total length of time for
both of these observations was approximately twenty (20) seconds. The
object at the time was reported to be within the scattered clouds at
20,000 feet, by 1300 miles an estimated (86) 36, down point 34, with a
radar cone *50 by 10 at about [unreadable] 125 per hour. The *** the
width was one (1) mile, with fog ceiling due to scattered stratus.
Weather conditions were rapidly changing at the time. The object
appeared to about 20' above the observers horizon. Its size in com-
parison to the hand held at an arms length from the face was about that
of the index and third finger. The object had no definite color and
no luminosity. There were no projections observed. There appeared to
be no aircraft on clouds in the vicinity and **** asserts that the ***
ject was drawn in the object by the glow of a navigation jet from the
object. Jet Glow is a jet type of engine jet projectile that it atters
lights to jet going variable on all planes. From exactly behind the

was sent to Air Material Command from March Flight Service Center. In-

the occurrence by a report from Los Angeles Control Center. This Con-

STANDARD

I am a Reserve pilot, 703rd ACG Unit, at Fresno, California. On the night of
February 28, 1949, I was pilot of a T11 aircraft No. 736 on a round-trip flight 
from Fresno Air Terminal, California, to Los Angeles and return. I departed Fresno
1845 hours with one crew member. At approximately 2030 PST while in the vicinity of
Sandberg Pass, 10 miles south of Bakersfield, while flying on a northerly heading
at an altitude of approximately 9,000 feet, I observed what appeared to be a jet-
propelled aircraft of an unfamiliar type, either very near Sandberg Pass with their
scrattered clouds, visibility 10 miles*, temperature 36C, cloud covering at approximately
20,000 feet, dew point 31, wind south 7, altimeter 3007. The visibility West was
1 mile with fog ceiling and visibility variable due to scattered stratus drifting in
the area. The object with the general shape of a slim speedhead-headed-on about
1500 feet above me, made a complete 360° circle, and which on a heading of 150° to my
course. The object left a steady glow at the rear left I believe to be a jet
exhaust. At the time I was unable to warn the rear of this aircraft and due to time
observed, the object. The co-pilot too determined it disappearing two minutes arc less
anvailable conditions. The object appeared to be six times the size of a T-11 
and that it took about 180 seconds for object to make a 360° turn about my aircraft.
During this maneuver I observed the object to be approximately 200 feet long of the
flight. The windshield of my aircraft was clear at the time the observation fras
made.

When the object completed the turn and left; I immediately attempted to contact
the pilot of another aircraft also on a round-robin about 10 minutes behind me,
It was answered by someone who I believed to be this pilot but I later learned that,
although he had been only momentarily, he had been unable to maneuver to the
difference of the individual I communicated with. The co-pilot did not observe as 
identifiy the individual with whom I communicated. The other pilot that I was
attempting to contact did not observe the object and to my knowledge I am the only
person who made the actual observation.

Comments of Interrogator relative to intelligence and character of observer(s):

I am a Resevre pilot, 703rd A&E Unit, at Reno, California. On the night of
February 20, 1949, I was pilot of a T-6 aircraft No. 7385 on a round-robin flight
from Reno to several California airports and returned to Sandberg Pass on 
the approximate time of 2030. At approximately 2030 PST while in the vicinity of 
M.T.R. Sandberg Pass, 10 miles south of Bakersfield, while flaying on a northerly heading
at an altitude of approximately 9,000 feet, I observed what appeared to be a jet-
propelled aircraft of an unfamiliar type. Weather over Sandberg Pass was thin
scattered clouds, visibility 10 miles, temperature 26, cloud coverage at approxi-
mately 20,000 feet, dew point 34, wind south 7, altimeter 3007. The visibility
was was 1 mile with fog rolling and visibility variable due to scattered strands
drifting in thin streaks. The object which the general shape of a blimp approached
head-on about 1500 feet above me, made a complete 360° spiral, and left on a heading
of 60° to my course. The object left a steady glow in the rear which I believed
to be a jet exhaust. At the time the co-pilot was in the rear of the aircraft
and at no time observed the object. I was unable to determine its distance from 
me due to darkness and elimination conditions. The object appeared about as big as
two fingers at arm's length. But it took about 3 seconds for the object's
glow to turn about my craft and during this maneuver I could observe the glow to be
approximately 20° above my line of flight. The windshield of my aircraft was
clear at the time the observation was made.

When the object completed the turn and loft, I immediately attempted to contact
the pilot of another aircraft also on a round-robin about 10 minutes behind me.
I was answered by someone whom I believed to be this pilot but I later learned
that, although he had received my transmission, had been unable to reply due to
the interference of the unknown individual who was answering me. I was never able
to identify the individual with whom I communicated. The other pilot that I was
attempting to contact did not observe the object, and to my knowledge I am the only
person who made the actual observation.

2 May 1949

SUBJECT: Investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects

To:

Commanding General
Air Materiel Command
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

1. In compliance with 1st Indorsement to basic letter, MLO 
ANR 200-112, subject: Information of Unidentified Flying Object,
dated 1 March 1949, the following report of investigation is sub-
mitted:

a. 1st Lt. ████████████████, Air Force Reserves Pilot, 
stationed with 709th Air Reserve Unit, Fresno State Teachers College,
Fresno, California, is above grade and submitted a written statement 
concerning his observation of an unfamiliar flying object. This ob-
servation was made in the vicinity of Sandberg Pass, forty (40) miles 
South of Bakersfield, California, at approximately 20 PST, 23 Feb-
ruary 1949. No other persons were found who had witnessed the flight 
of this object. [Dude to investigation of unidentified aerial ob-
jects, which was furnished this office by Air Material Command, was 
used during the interrogation.

b. 1st Lt. ███████████, a student of Industrial Arts at Fresno State 
Teachers College, Fresno, California, appeared to be an earnest young 
man, rather quiet and reserved, with no particular set of facial
expression. He is regarded as sober and respectable and enjoys a 
good reputation among his associates, in the school. In the opinion 
of the Investigating Officer, Lt █████ would have neither the inclina-
tion nor the ability to construct and a report a wild story of fan-
tasy.

c. 1st Lt. █████████ was first interviewed on 22 March 1949, It is re-
ported that at the time of the observation he had been lost in the 
fog, pilots woas a 0-1 in the 033, a large one seated at a round 
table in cross country proficiency flights from one instructional 
to another. The object, which he observed was.

sausage shaped in that both the forward and trailing ends resembled a sharp nose. The object was on a heading approximately North to a 230-280 approximate return course when it was originally seen while he made his first observation. This object disappeared to the rear of the F-11 and then apparently it made a 360° turn around it as it made his second observation approximately fifteen (15) seconds later when the object appeared to his right and made a 180° turn in front of him, again disappearing to the rear. The total length of time for both of these observations was approximately twenty (20) seconds. The weather at the time was reported to be high thin scattered clouds at 20,000 feet, sky 10 miles. Temperature was 56, dew point 34, with a wind from the South at about eight (8) miles per hour. Visibility to the west was one (1) mile, with fronts closing in to the south at about three (3) miles with a few ships observing the scattered overcasts. Supper conditions 200’ visibility changing from time to time in dust swept about by the head gear as the objects in the faces were all between the index and third finger. The object had no definite color and no luminosity. There were no protrusions, no very minor appearance to the no effect on clouds as yet by layer of superstrates that its altitude was drawn to the object the city and a presumption from the objects trail. Investigation of experienced from pilots reveal that although slow it was atrial unlike our observed any objects behind the trail of the F-11 right the tail pipe. The pilot was in the blackouts, looking at the top of the operational envelope flying of the object. The pilot attempted to contact another pilot flying a similar mission who was approximately ten (10) minutes behind him to ask him to watch for the object. He was answered by an unidentified voice over the radio whose he believed to be the pilot he was calling. Upon landing however, he discovered that although other pilots had received his message he had not been able to contact them because of the interference created by the unidentified person answering his call. The other pilots likewise observed nothing of the object.

d. It will be noted that the original report of this incident was sent to Air Material Command from March Flight Service Center. Investigation revealed that March Flight Service Center was informed of the occurrence by a report from Los Angeles Control Center. This Control Center probably received its information from one (1) or more of four (4) Radio Range Stations in the vicinity. These are the Bakersfield Radio, Lancaster Radio, Newhall Radio or Los Angeles Radio. It is believed that it was the operator on duty at one of these range stations that answered his call, although he did not identify himself and no information of a more definite nature could be obtained.

I am a licensed pilot, retired military man, reside in California. On the night of February 1949, I was pilot of a TN aircraft from Caldwell on a round-trip flight from Fresno Air Terminal, California, to Los Angeles and return. I departed Fresno 1515 hours with one crew member. At approximately 2030 PST while in the vicinity of Sandberg Pass, 10 miles south of Gormersfield, while flying on a northerly heading at an altitude of approximately 9,000 feet, I observed what appeared to be a jet-propelled aircraft of an unfamiliar type. Weather over Sandberg Pass was thin scattered clouds, visibility 10 miles, temperature 30, clouds visibility approximately 10,000 feet down to and including stratus. Airborne July 7. Covering at approximately 1 mile with fog ceiling and visibility variable due to scattered stratus drifting from the NW. The object with the general shape of a blimp appeared 'head-on' about 1500 feet above me, made a complete 360o circle, was lest on a heading of N 100o by compass. The object left a steady glow all the way round which I believed to be jet exhaust. At the time the co-pilot was in the rear of the aircraft and at no time observed the object. I was unable to determine size because no size classification are similar to known objects for comparison even in the distance there are certain characteristics. The object appeared about as big as two fingers at arm's length and it could have been as close as 300 feet to about half a distance from nearby aircraft. The first temporary observation of the object was approximately 200 feet by line of flight. The windshield of my aircraft was clear at this time the observation was made.

When the object completed the turn and left, I immediately attempted to contact the flight of another aircraft also on a round-robin about 10 minutes behind me. It was answered by someone who I believed to be this pilot, but I later learned that although he had received my transmission, he had been unable to reply due to the interference of the transmission individual who was maneuvering. It was never to his knowledge in the vicinity in which I saw this object. Upon landing, I attempted to contact the individual with whom I communicated. The other pilot that I was attempting to contact did not observe the object and to my knowledge I am the only person who made the actual observation.
