Dear Sirs:
I hope I am not just taking up your time but, this matter is so important to me and I. am now 74 years of age and attended ( a catholic school) in Titusville, Pa. recently, many jets have been seen over our little town and countryside and causes quite a disturbance. The incident occurred at about 9:30 p.m. on May 2, 1965. About that time I was in the house and set my telescope. Because the air was very clear I got a very good picture of it. It disappeared, after about 45 seconds. My Mother told me to call Civilian Defense. They told me I had an interesting sighting and suggested I write to you.
The object looked like I Lockheed F-104 Starfighter except it had no other aircraft nearby and was very clear and distinct. I would suggest you check at the local airport and see if any flights were reported on that date.
