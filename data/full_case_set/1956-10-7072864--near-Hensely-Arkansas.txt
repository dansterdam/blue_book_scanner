The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a Project 10073 record card from the Project Blue Book files. The card contains information about a sighting near Hensley, Arkansas on October 31, 1956. The sighting was described as a light or flash that appeared to burst into the ground and then disappeared after a short period of time. The report indicates that the sighting was observed, but provides no additional details or photographic evidence.

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7 - 3 - 52
33. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object was circular, metallic in appearance, reflecting the sun's rays. It was also absolutely silent, making no sound at all. It hovered for a few seconds, then moved at tremendous speed, literally disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. The object had a circular formation and remained stationary for a short period of time. After remaining motionless for a short while, it accelerated and shot off at approximately 90° right angle then leveled off, maintaining a constant speed and gradually disappearing from sight. I concluded that the object I observed was most likely an unconventional aircraft or a guided missile of some kind, considering the speed and maneuverability displayed.

These objects passed right over my house. They maneuvered in such a peculiar manner that I was astounded at their speed. They seemed to contract and expand their size in a rapid manner. These objects maneuvered in a zig-zag manner and I compared their speed to a jet fighter. I estimated their speed to be about 2000 mph. The objects seemed to oscillate somewhat in their flight, making sharp angular turns at high speed. Occasionally the objects seemed to tumble or roll, giving the impression that they were under intelligent control. The only man-made objects I am familiar with that could perform in this manner are not yet operational as far as I know. Whatever these objects were, they were definitely not conventional aircraft. These things were fast, very fast, and seemed to defy the laws of physics as we know them. If I may speculate, I will say that I believe some type of advanced propulsion system was involved, possibly a new form of nuclear-powered propulsion or something radically different from current aerodynamic flight principles.

23-24 October 1956
England

INFINITY

1956,Mid-Oct.--Bournemouth Bay, England--About Midnight--Ten bright, pear-shaped objects seen over the Bournemouth pier. Changing color from white to blue. Seen by man and his wife.

1956,Oct.23--The UFO's descended from high altitude 25,000 feet Fighter Aircraft at about 25,000 ft. Two very bright, amber colored lights, one each side, suddenly paced the fighter then drew away rapidly.

1956,Oct.22--The UFO's were seen at tremendous speed "No navigation lights visible. Lights heading 3 turns sharply E and away" "seemed to be attached for 5 or 6 sift to something quite out of the ordinary."

1956,Oct.23--Rugby, England--2 very bright LIGHTS at around 1,500 ft. No sound. Seen by former RAF man at low level, Rugby.  
Lights rapidly ascended and disappeared from view as a "great speed".  Wind blowing app. 15-20 miles per hour at the time.

There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a handwritten document containing text.

The text in the document is as follows:

Please excuse the poor writing, as I have a rather difficult script to decipher. The caller indicated that these lights or whatever were almost directly overhead in a southeast direction. He said they were about 30 feet in size, oval shaped and were greenish-white in color. He stated they remained stationary for about 5 minutes, then moved slowly to the southwest and disappeared from view. He said they gave off a bright light and did not blink. There were 3 or 4 objects observed. He seems to be a reliable observer and is somewhat knowledgeable about aviation. I do not recommend any extensive investigation, as I believe this to be a case of misidentification of some known object, possibly an aircraft or satellites. However, should you wish to do some discreet checking, please feel free to contact me.

OCR output:

Life are so marvelous, Delightful and beautiful case of object seen in the sky the night of October 7, 1956 near Hendley, Arkansas. At about 6:50 P.M. a round object with a bright red light in the middle, was observed approaching from the southwest. It appeared to slow down, make a circle and then resumed its course to the northeast. It was observed for at least 10 minutes and then disappeared. The object did not cast any light on the ground and made no sound. It appeared to be from 100 to 200 feet in diameter and was closer than any conventional aircraft I have ever seen. Its speed was much less than a jet plane and it was completely silent. Solex says that I didn't get off the right foot there, but I had a feeling that I must report this unusual observation, so I called the Air Force on the next day. They were very interested and said they would investigate. I am not given to pranks or imagining things, but this was very unusual and worth reporting to the proper authorities. I cannot explain it, but I am convinced it was not any conventional aircraft. So, there it is about what I saw that evening. Let me know what you think or if you have any suggestions.
