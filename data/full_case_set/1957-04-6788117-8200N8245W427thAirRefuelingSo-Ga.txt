EDGES IT APPEARED HOWEVER THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN TRIANGLER OR SQUARE
PD BRILLIANCE MADE IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE EXACT SHAPE PD B PD
SIZE OF OBJECT APPEARED ABOUT ONE TENTH OF A HALF MOON IF BOTH WERE
AT SAME ALTITUDE PD C PD COLOR WAS SIMILAR TO THE MOON EXCEPT ABOUT
TWICE MOON'S BRILLIANCE WHEN FIRST NOTICED PAREN 22202 PAREN PD
AT THE TIME IT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY PD D PD ONLY ONE WAS
SIGHTED PD E PD NO FORMATION PD F PD BRILLIANCE MADE IT DIFFICULT 
TO DETERMINE ANY EXACT DETAILS PD BLURRED EDGES MADE IT APPEAR TO

HEARD PD I PD OBJECT AT FIRST APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY AND THEN IT
APPEARED TO BE ASCENDING PAREN 22052 PAREN AND LOSING SLIGHT
BRILLIANCE PD THERE WAS NO RADICAL CHANGE BUT IRREGULAR PATH SLOWLY
DRIFTING EASTWARD PD AT 22132 OBJECT WAS LESS BRILLIANT THAN MOON
AND SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN WHEN FIRST SIGHTED PD 22132 FIRST CELESTIAL
BODY WAS SIGHTED IN THE EAST PD THE CELESTIAL BODY WAS NOT A STAR
BUT BELIEVED TO BE PLANET JUPITER PD 22142 OBJECT APPEARED TO BE
ORANGE AND HALF BRILLIANT AS MOON CMM CHANGING COLOR RAPIDLY AND
DIMINISHING IN SIZE RAPIDLY PD 22152 SLIGHTLY SMALLER AND LESS
BRILLIANT THAN THE PLANET JUPITER PD 22242 OBJECT STILL DIMLY IN
SIGHT PD GIVES EFFECT OF THIRD RATE STAR PD OBJECT MOVED ABOUT 5
DEGREES EASTWARD FROM WHEN FIRST SIGHTED AND APPEARED TO BE
ASCENDING MORE RAPIDLY PD AT THIS TIME OTHER CELESTIAL BODIES
WERE SIGHTED AND THE UFO APPEARED TO BE MOVING OUTWARD PD 2 PD A PD
ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED BY THE FACT THAT IT WAS DAYLIGHT CMM ONLY
A HALF MOON CMM IT WAS NOT A STAR NOR A PLANET NOR ANY WEATHER EQUIP
PD B PD OBSERVED ELEVATION WAS 80 TO 85 DEGREES CMM OBSERVED
AZIMUTH ABOUT 30 DEGREES WHEN FIRST DISCOVERED PD C PD OBSERVED
ELEVATION REMAINED ABOUT THE SAME PD AZIMUTH ABOUT 35 DEGREES WHEN
OUT OF SIGHT PD D PD HOVERING WHEN FIRST SEEN CMM THEN ASCENDING
SLOWLY THEN VERY RAPIDLY PD DRIFTED ABOUT 5 DEGREES EASTWARD PD E PD
DISAPPEARANCE DUE TO VERY SMALL SIZE AND OUT OF SIGHT PD F PD IN
SIGHT ABOUT 25 MINUTES PAREN 22022 TO 22252 PAREN PD 3 PD A PD
