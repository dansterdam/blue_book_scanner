ON 22 July 1950, at 1710 hours (Alaska time) an unidentified object was sighted over Ladd Air Force Base, Fairbanks, Alaska. The object was described as bright white in color, a circular shape and quite large.

- Object was viewed laterally from gun positions at an angle of from 50 to 70 degrees.
- Object was red in color with two (2) white dots underneath which seemed to revolve around it. It was round in shape, about three (3) feet in diameter and of unknown configuration.
- Object moved from East to West at an unknown rate of speed. It appeared to be moving in a straight line and steadily descending.
- Any exhaust emitted from the object evaporated very rapidly. The two (2) white dots appeared to be approximately vertical dimensions above and beneath the main body of the object. The white dots appeared to go through motions suggestive of antennae or irregular surface protuberances.
- After about 20 minutes, the object had been almost stationary for approximately twenty (20) minutes, it disappeared in a diagonal direction.
The following persons on active duty with United States Armed Forces at Ladd Air Force Base observed the object: Ist Lt. USA, USAF and several unidentified soldiers of a battery fire control crew. All observers have been trained, and all were considered by the investigating officer to be very reliable.
Weather at the time of observation was CAVU. There were no known aircraft in the area at the time; and all weather stations contacted in the vicinity reported there were no weather devices aloft by their stations. 
The following are the comments appearing at the close of the (Alaska Air Command Regulation 200-2) intelligence report: No material interpretation can be offered as to the origin or nature of the object observed. The objects which might have flashed into the immediate area from some other station in the area for history of Alaskan. One possibility is also considered that the object sighted was some highly classified experiment or test by the Army, Navy, or Air Force, which this command knew nothing about.
COMMENT: Alaskan Air Command evaluated the report D-6. Alaskan Air Command original report (Regulation Report 17-20) forwarded to The Director of Intelligence, USAF, Washington, D.C. on 13 September 1950.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Objects
LOCATION: Ladd AFB, Alaska
DATE: 22 July 1950

SUMMARY: This report covers the sighting of unusual aerial objects in the vicinity of Ladd AFB, Alaska, on 22 July 1950. Observers sighted one or more objects which exhibited unusual aerial characteristics. However, due to the circumstances of the sighting and the difficulty in obtaining positive identification, further investigation is considered necessary.

Objects sighted are described as a brownish or reddish color, about the size of a basketball, and traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. The objects were observed for a short period of time and then disappeared from view. Exact measurements and detailed descriptions were not obtained, and identification of the objects is not certain.

According to Headquarters USAF Air Intelligence Requirements Memorandum No. 4, dated 12 September 1952, this report has been prepared in accordance with provisions set forth therein.
