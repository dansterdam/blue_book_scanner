This page does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document includes a section titled "Lunar Libration Chart" which shows a chart related to lunar libration, as well as text describing the chart and related information. There is also a section titled "Precision Diagonals" which appears to be some kind of technical information or specifications.

OCR Output:
LUNAR LIBRATION CHART
This chart shows the hourly positions of the Lnnar north and south nodes during a complete Lunar cycle. The locations of the nodes at perigee (nearest distance from the earth) and apogee (farthest distance from the earth) are marked, as are the mean positions oF the nodes at different phases of the Moon. The libration cycles of the Moon are very complex and numerous; this chart depicts only the most general and prominent features.
The locations of the nodes are of interest with respect to UFO phenomena, since objects are often reported moving in and out of the Lunar disc, or near the limb of the Moon, during various Lunar phases and libration conditions. This is the apparent facility for both visual and radar recognition and observation. The more rapid motion of the Lunar nodes and the perigee-apogee cycle may provide a correlation with some UFO sightings and activities.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
6 NOVEMBER 1963
SUBJECT:  Unidentified Flying Object, New Paltz, N.Y., 9 November 1963
1. On 9 November 1963, this office received a METICULOUS from the Office of Special Investigations, SAC New York, which reported the sighting of an unidentified flying object near New Paltz, N.Y., on 9 November 1963.
2. The METICULOUS stated that at approximately 1915 hours on 9 November 1963, a local resident of New Paltz, N.Y., observed an unidentified flying object in the sky near his residence. The object was described as being round or circular in shape, of a brilliant white color, and approximately the size of a large automobile tire. The object remained stationary for several minutes, then moved rapidly off to the southwest and disappeared from sight.
3. The METICULOUS further stated that no other witnesses to the sighting were located, and that no other details were available.
4. This case is being filed without further investigation, as the limited information available precludes any meaningful analysis or evaluation.
