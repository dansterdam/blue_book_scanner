August 3rd, 1965

Dear Sir,

I hear you may think I'm just a 23 year old boy, but I'm not. I am very interested in the UFO investigations. Maybe I don't know as much as some of the scientists that have studied them, but I've taken a special interest about the UFOs.

On the night of May 9, 1965 a friend of mine and I saw a very peculiar thing. It was a beam of orange light that came down across the sky and disappeared. My friend's house has a clearing in the woods where we could see the sky clearly. We both saw the same thing at the same time. I asked him what he thought it was and he said he didn't know but it sure was strange. We both agreed that we had never seen anything like it before. 

The next day, when the object was moving with the light to light up, my friend and I went to look but we couldn't see anything definite.

I was wondering if you could tell me or suggest what I might have seen. There were no sounds at all and the light was very brilliant. The light seemed to come down and then go back up into the sky. We both guessed that it was some type of unusual aircraft but we're not sure.

I would appreciate any information you can give me on this subject.

Transcribing the text from the image:

"we were quiet. The 4th watched and discussed it as long as it was in sight. The objects moved at a fantastic rate of speed. then about two and one half minutes we watched it disappear. Its path was watched to the end though it followed a zig zag course while visible until it was too far away to observe. It seemed to be about 30 feet long and did not appear to have any lights or propelling devices. An strange materialistic body down nearer than the sky above but not nearer the ground. It moved from us and receded in the distance. 

P.S. We were not imagining things.
It was the last day of school and we were well, the last thing we would have thought about was "flying saucers".
I have enclosed a questionaire from the book "Flying Saucers from Outer Space" and a photograph from a magazine which I like the object we saw and I have 20 20 vision."

SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, College Park, Georgia, 2 May 1965

TO: Hq USAF SAFCPIC (Mrs Hunt)
Wash D C 20330

This office is in receipt of an unidentified flying object report from College Park, Georgia. 
The following is a suggested reply:

a. Dear Mr _____
The sighting on the night of 2 May 1965 is characteristic of a satellite observation. In your discussion you indicate that the object changed direction and speed. However, satellite orbits frequently exhibit these characteristics, and the apparent changes in speed and direction are normal. The passage of the object is about the speed of satellites.

We have checked the Echo and Pegasus schedules and your sighting occurred midway between the passage of Pegasus I at 8:10 pm and Echo I at 8:54 pm. These objects were visible as stated.

There are more than thirty satellites and satellite components visible to the naked eye.

We agree that the object could not have been a meteorite because of the reported duration.

The attached brochure depicts the results of the Air Force program on the subject of unidentified flying objects.
The Air Force regards the books by Donald E Keyhoe on flying saucers as science fiction.
