I was sitting on a ranch with the object overhead over Guadaloupe.

Grand Turks:
I happened to be looking at the sky just when this object appeared. I called attention to it and he said it so. I asked him what he thought it was and he said he didn't know but it was not a reasonable or anything like a usual sort of thing. It was about 5:45 and we watched it for a little while - the object.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

a. Certain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object you saw. Of what type material would you want it to be made, and what shape would it be, and what other shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

It is difficult to imagine what kind of actual object would match the appearance you described, as the reported details are rather vague and do not provide a clear picture. Without more specifics about the object's size, shape, motion, and disappearance, it is challenging to identify a common earthly object that could resemble it in the sky. The report leaves much room for interpretation.

The image does not contain any photographs. It consists of sketches and diagrams illustrating instructions for how to estimate the height of an unidentified object above the horizon based on its position in the sky.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
