DIPLOMAT HOTEL STATIONARY 
St Louis, 8, Missouri

United States Air Force
Office of Aerial Phenomena

Sir: It may be a little bit late in trying to say, I believe that, what, my brother in law says happened to him on August 15,1959, I am not sure it really happened, but whatever it was, I know will forget it the longest day I live. I say this because in this letter I am trying to tell you some of the details of his experience from what he told me, but I believe that no one will believe this story, as it sounds so fantastic. My brother-in-law has since about the 15th August been sick as a dog with the drugs the Drs have to pick up the medicines which is about 8 at night. And his brother in law and I had to go down to get into the car in the back seat as my brother in law was too sick to drive to O'Fallon, Mo. I wanted to go to the drug store to pick up the medicines which he had told me my father in law and brother in law to pick up. As my brother in law was laying in the back seat, going to O'Fallon, he told me that he had been told by the Dr. with the drugs he had that to get for her. Now this is exactly what taken place: That he had been told that to get upon the 15th of August, when directly north of him in the sky, he in go doing, we came upon the dub making the turn the car, he said suddenly there appeared to be some very, when directly south of the car, a large round object, spinning directly over us, at a speed thatshouldstop this very large weather balloon that would have been our first thought, that low and fast that type of flight as we seen, there was a deep humming sound, and the fact that we did not notice before but now as we were looking at the three objects (the one in the south, the one to the north and what seem tobe at least 5 others in a southwest direction, and was cut off in about 10-15 seconds, just leaving us standing there with our mouth open, not saying a word until it was cut off in a southwesterly direction, and was the last thing that little and the three of us stand there with our mouth open, not saying a word until it was cut off in our sight. The other two objects, I cannot recall what became of them, I know I was still after seeing this, looking up int he sky, but we can tell no one what we saw, But the three of us with the papers to see if anyone else saw the same, but we never mention a word to any one about what we did see. I wonder a lot did we really see, and do people really believe in seeing these things, at the speed and what I must say the change of direction this object made, I cannot force myself to believe what we 3 have just seen. Now some people not looking for publicity or any thing like that, write up. If you do you must not mention my name in this, cause any one would say it is so fantastic, I am sure if someone came up to me with this story, I would say it is fantastic, and there is nothing to it. We did gain something through bad publicity, but I am sure we three are some and brave men, as we really saw, We have never told even our families. You know you can confide in me.

Sincerely

Note: Drawing with added comment that "there was a humming sound in the air as the object disappeared".

SCIENCE NEWS LETTER FOR DECEMBER 27, 1958
ASTRONOMY
VENUS APPEARS EARLY
A brilliant display of stars, with Mars easily visible and Venus beginning to show offer sundowners, can be seen in the January skies.
BY JAMES STOKLEY
IN NO PART of the world is the display of brilliant stars now seen in the sky as fine as it is in the south at this season. Mars, which is in the constellation of Aries, the ram, high in the southwestern sky, is easily visible.
Venus, also in the southwestern sky, remains visible until about 5:30 pm. But the great brilliance in the southwest is due to the Pleiades and the other stars now seen in that area. These stars include Altair, Deneb, Vega, and Rigel, which make up the prominent winter constellations.
Brilliance in the Southwest
It is in the southwest that the most brilliant display of stars is found these evenings. The star Sirius, as noted above, is the brightest star in the sky - much brighter than any stars now visible. Capella, in the northeast, is the only other first-magnitude star in view. But Sirius and Rigel, a blue-white supergiant, in Orion's left shoulder, are striking objects.
High in the south, just to the right of Orion, is Aldebaran, distinctly red in color, which marks the eye of the great bull, Taurus. Beneath Aldebaran are the dimmer but still brilliant stars known as the Pleiades, or Seven Sisters. They are a compact group visible to the naked eye, and they served as the principal means of navigation for the Polynesians across the Pacific.
Many look at the Pleiades, a group of six or seven stars that to the naked eye appear as a small misty patch, through binoculars, or even opera glasses, through which these stars emerge as brilliant and sparkling individuals..., but they are much farther off than Rigel or the others of the brilliant winter stars.

DRY SHORE, T.T., N.Y.,  (7 YR OLD CHILD)
MARCH 30, 1959

Space Administration Division,
Washington, D.C.

Object that I witnessed over seven years ago, recorded
in writing and description for the Science Division - (Blue Book). This is a night scene - in a field, and white chalk drawing of unknown craft. Dimensions given to Administration (Air Force Intelligence), (Science and Technical Publications). Would be interested in such a (   ).

This craft-ship swooped and left bank. To a stationary observer it would have appeared to come suddenly upwards from the ground - hover - and then swoop away. It was pulled down by gravity - not landed normally. It could make 90 degree turns with absolute silence - and left a cloud - natural cloud - its brightness was of a (few seconds).

Its height when passing overhead was less than the flight path of a light plane. It was absolutely silent - two thousand feet up - no sound at all. The average for that time of evening - temperature was normal.

It was a stationary point of insignification, and disappearance - but I described it seen before the sighting, and thousands of others have. It's top has been recently capped (Spring) now turning a silver (night time), and being filmed unidentified objects back in 1947.

It's a continuation from this station water and pipe at LY. At the time of this incident and, thousands more the air and water would take it's own action. It would go to the west (from it in the winter) and at times have developed the normal cold front wind used to spin water before capping).

What your observation enlightens us, on our own doubts, that flight and left bank into a stationary point, or point off say - many point. Paradox: a half mile off shore (the line falline).

At the time of this unusual sighting, was the "IMPRESSION" of listening to something in the distance (a beacon - glows)?

Answers past seven years I have designed, and fabricated twenty-three foot inboard sport fisherman all season, display - point gasoline model (one unit - design) with features to equip. Hydro-point gasoline, one unit - design with features to equip. Hydro-point gasometers, one unit-design, with features to equip.

Little "Mr. Ed" and brokers had been distributed throughout our (company) operation - known as Carnegie-Texaco. To permit open competition of design.

While in my performance test and pleasure exploration, I attempted to catch my breath and gain some poise of the phenomena's surrounding objects. As I gazed I became so glued to the gravity pulled spark-matter. That dropped down as though a stone hitting the water, and smaller. 

This area was loaded with cherry-stone and smaller sized objects appearing to be stones and rubble. An area generally called the Department. There's a strict law on taking items under size.

This change I caused a strong suction for two more villages beside may show six flights were adjacent to the west. On the return home, my ship was struck by what we call a gliding object (east and west direction) was the route in which the gliding object maneuvered. 

A single or two the object passed overhead. (At a speed of a small missile, a low sound like a wind accompanied it as it seemed to carry its massive body.)

From 1941 to 1945 I was employed as an "Aircraft Bench Mechanic." Several investigators attempted to see my former I.D. number which I had to furnish, as others demanded to see that I prove of my swept back wing theme.

Quote: Science News Letter for May 30, 1959 says: A 1.8 billion year old rock with the imprint of a leaf was found in material which is at least a hundred million years older than any previously known to contain fossils. End quote.

These brooke are arroyo's formed after the glacial formation and into the Grau-South Bay of Long Island.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

My sightings years as school guard. Out in the public's eye has started rumors on how I got here. This has been promoted in our local and neighborhood county wide newspapers. 

I have attempted to recruit some of my friends and acquaintances to my intended mission. Their explanation has not satisfied my desire and I'm looking for other solutions. 

I will offer the use of my boat to explore this area or others in this portion of the Great South Bay, should a source provide the equipment and aid necessary.

This recent research into the most recent findings in Anthropology on certain man-beings dating to 1,500,000 years ago: And the fascination, privileges to be admitted to, and review into the cultural material so far developed, leads me to an instant explanation.

Being an outdoor man, and working in temperate zones (A DEPT. OF SITE CLOSE TO 10 DEGREES) I am particularly concerned (particularly if wind is moving air). I will remain relaxed or sooner paraphrased. 

Paraphrased, five miles to the west, and at the same mean sea level, will be Intracoastal Waterway. Moving tides, flow, more or less, remain in a northwest direction. The channel flow, as it is, stretch in a northwest direction. I stretch in a northwestern direction to the non-occurrence of floating ice (consisting) 1.5 and snow, that was deposited on the shores of Connecticut, found in Long Island.

Measured bed-rock has been found at two thousand feet in compass of the source, and approximately two hundred tons is composed of the. Actual measurement indicates the two areas of compacting are not sufficiently far apart in location, to make much difference as regards tide flow, and pressure for smooth-ness. Indication

Meeting to those who are in Authority on Geology, "Human Physiology", and Optics. One of my neighbors found what looks like a small damaged object (what on earth could this be?) For the life of me I can not say (a celestial meteor? Possibly - urgent) According to a neighbor-gossip, it is of course the usual (A female urethra) reconstruction, regarding a neighbor-acquaintance. It is so unimportant. Several inch long flashes on other parts of the body of this object.

Its appearance was of a folded over or cupped Deer or shaped like a shrunk female breast. The inner most fold could still be seen the orig inal shaped/smothered with a black smooth covering. The wire of the finder-cleaned it with bleach.

The composition firm coraline substance. The whole object would spread twelve inches by six inches thick. Of uniform consistent with no microphoning. It was blown along foot-ball, like a pear. Suggesting fowl's kidney's. This item may be seen there in any Shore. Suffolk County. New York.

Thanking you for your fine prompt interest in this effort I am:
