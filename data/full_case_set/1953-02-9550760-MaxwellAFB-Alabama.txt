SUMMARY: (Limit outline to essentials of report. Give impressions in final one-sentence paragraph. Limit continuous sense left. Begin text of report on Air Form 112-Part II.)

At approximately 2145 hours (local time) 4 February 1953, Captain Robert S. Gleason observed an object overhead traveling at a very high rate of speed. Its altitude could not be accurately estimated but appeared to be very high. The object appeared white against the ground but was slightly larger than a star. Captain Gleason could not estimate its size because its altitude was unknown. The object was noiseless and appeared overhead on a course due west. Before it dropped out of view on the horizon it veered to the north-west, gaining altitude. It then dropped out of sight.

Approximately one minute later another object of the same description appeared on the horizon. This second object continued on a course due west, then dropped over the horizon. During these sightings Captain Gleason described the weather as perfectly clear, visibility unlimited, and the sighting was in view for approximately 15 seconds.

These sightings were witnessed and confirmed by 1st Lt. Joseph A. Pichler and 1st Lt. Lawrence H. Duval Jr., both Air Force Officers. (Captain Gleason and Lt. Duval are rated personnel.) Sightings were made by the naked eye. The observers were located on the ground at the northern section of Maxwell Air Force Base.
