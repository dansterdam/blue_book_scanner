It occurred at a small airport and the duration was one half minute. Following shortly there were three or four sightings made to determine if there were other potential witnesses. Since it occurred at night on December 29, it is possible that there were no other significant witnesses available. Must be carried as unidentified.

15. 12 August 1965, Ramona, California.
One witness, duration of sighting only 15 seconds. Had a 67-year old lady still viewing thing in the sky saving time in the middle of August, 1965, and thus the sky still having been reasonably bright. Still have been reasonably bright after 6 p.m. at night. Must be listed as unknown (message cannot be determined).

16. 26 February 1966, Bartlett, New Hampshire
I have in my files for 26 February 1966, Manchester, New Hampshire. I do not seem to find a Bartlett, New Hampshire case. See attached supplemental sheet A.

17. 17 July 1966, Centerville, Ohio.
Temporarily not in file. Will study this case when I visit Dayton.

18. 9 February 1967, Odessa, Delaware.
Since by an admitted breakdown in communications the Air Force has delayed some five months in investigating this case, all I have is the NICAP report. Evaluation pending my visit to copy of the Air Force investigation of same. Based on NICAP report, the sighting is obviously unidentified.

19. 12 February 1967, Grand Rapids, Michigan.
I have only the case send on this case, but judging from it, there seems to be a possibility that this one-witness case was observed by low-flying birds reflecting light. The sighting lasted only 10 seconds, and witness mentions a high-pitched chirping noise.

20. 1 April 1967, Wellington or Loco, Texas.
I had a great personal involvement in this case, much of it classified.

Independent of official Project Blue Book business. This was very involved and I feel must be classified as psychotic hoax unless other data turns up to change this, which is unlikely. 

In synopsis forms because of my interest in any psychopathological manifestations of Williston, Texas, and had a long taped interview with him. He sounded simple and straightforward, in fact so simple that I feel a complete psychotic hoax would be beyond his capabilities. The reports seemed to have been concocted by Dr. Sheldon who was also seen up and noticing on the picture to suggest that this was not an analysis and he was did not continue to find in any conclusive fine in the analysis was not analytical and was in the impression that it was another object to judge distances, etc., and the subject photographed could not have been a small object at a very close range.

I had also taken the precaution of calling the sheriff Wellington and getting a rundown on Williston. The sheriff volunteered the information that Williston farms close to town, which incidentally was corroborated by his appearance - the knowledge of photography whatever.  This information further - the small long story short - the man was not too bright, and from his standpoint alone a photograph those seemed unlikely. He volunteered, however, that if a he were involved, Mrs. (redacted) would be the more likely engineer of such a hoax.  

Shortly thereafter two reporters from Amarillo called. Apparently they had heard about this and told them I could give them no story for them until I had confirmation. Of course the picture was never shot. I told the reporters how I felt, but that they might have a good story. This and following my suggestion, had a lie detector test administered and he was generally dismissed as you will know in the papers, as is well known. I then had a phone call which came from his ranch some distance from Williston and Wellington, to get his reaction and to again sound him out, but nothing new was forthcoming. The information given under hypnosis was the same as previously given consecutively by Mr. (redacted). This unsatisfied phone call surprised me but I considered it just another one of the unusual things in this additional case.

Shortly thereafter, I learned that Mr. [REDACTED] had said that the whole thing was a hoax, that he had been put up under hypnosis to tell a very articulate-hypnotist who had set him up some days earlier. The story then went something like this:

The hypnotist had apparently put out of a clear sky (may I shouldn't use that expression in this context!), had given the set of features, one of which included the name of the purported occupants of the craft, and under hypnosis, Mr. [REDACTED] had told the story to me. By this I wanted nothing further to do with the case, but I wasn't sure the hoaxist (or the hypnotist), when he or she was unmasked, would not subject him to ridicule. I told him that first of all the Air Force and that it is the injured party who brings suit and that I heard that the Air Force or I had been injured by his purported actions.

This would seemingly have ended it, except that I learned that the hypnotist when he had first called me, had mentioned that he had been doing some work with the physics department at the University of Colorado (no connection that I was aware of with the O.C. Commission). As it so happens that [REDACTED] took his Master's Degree with us at Ohio State University. I thought a call to him might be in order. This I did and was surprised to learn that the hypnotist (whose name I do not recall at the moment) had not really been connected with the University, but I guess that he felt it might give him a certain amount of status and authenticity.

I am told that the hypnotist (if needed) has a daughter that had worked for several years or so, and found that the studio and home of the artist and only part-time hypnotist. He had found him through a thoroughly honorable and standing college, and could not conceive that this man could have perpetrated such a hoax. In fact, we considered it incredible in the extreme.

It remains this information to the reporters, largely out of a sense of duty, since they were rapidly losing interest in the case. But I would like to tell them that this information changed his story once again. He now stated that he had flunked the lie detector test, which in fact had been accessed by two men who stuffed him up and warned him at it, and this the hypnotist had not made it clear that he would never make it known. I do not know whether it is possible to deliberately flunk a lie detector test, but the fact remains that he did.

The puzzling thing about the entire case is how Mr. came to possess the photographs which were the circumstances under which the photographs were taken, and how were they contacted? Somebody must have contarted them to find out also, whether Mr. was ever known to have rough photographs in the local scores and what he has sayingabout photography himself. The reply to this as far as could be determined, was negative. If one had the time, this would make a very interesting, but not terribly significant detective story. It would suggest if any anybody made an paychy made their deperse them:

It should be pointed out that the sighting was by no means the only reported in that area. There followed quite a spate of reports, apparently all through the year, and on 23 November 9 they made a typical UFO counter, luminous body sightings. "It was big enough to drive a car behind", and it slowed down until it was thought like a cigar - shaped object round.

I believe there is a moral to be drawn from the Wellington case. Had the Altua Air Force Base reacted promptly and done a good investigation, this case would never have gotten very early on the authorities, and it particular, had found out how Mr. had come into possession of said pictures. lot of later trouble could have been saved. We still don't know how the pictures came into being.

21. 21 April 1967, Shirley, Kentucky.
The evaluation "possible aircraft" seems okay. The sighting fits a pattern of the unusual, but we do not know how much the young boys "read into" what might have been a perfectly ordinary sighting. They are familiar with UFO literature and could have given a highly preferential interpretation to their sighting. The sighting was of short duration and the telescopic sighting was 20 seconds or less, hardly enough time to make a good appraisal at a time of high excitement. We could have determined how much of this was interpretation and how much was fact.

22. 3 April 1967, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The evaluation "aircraft" on this is ludicrous. If any evidence whatever is given to the sanity and reliability of the observer, if it was an aircraft, then it deviated in the mind of the observer an entire fantasy because as the observer stated, "That does not seem similar to this object I saw." Or could even compare to it."
