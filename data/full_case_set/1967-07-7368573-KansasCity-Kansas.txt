SUGAR COULD BE MADE -- IT FLEW A STRAIGHT COURSE CROSSING THE STATE LINE FROM BLOCK SOUTH OF OUR VANTAGE POINT. 
THE AIR FORCE DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OTHER REPORTS, TO OUR GROUP SO FAR, THEY HAVE NOT MADE PUBLIC THROUGH ANY EVIDENCE, THAT CAME TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THROUGH ANY DOCUMENTS TO THE AIR FORCE -- WHAT CHANCE EVER TO 
CONVICT THESE WAS NO LONGER THAN IF IT HAPPENED AT THAT VERY TIME AND THERE. 
MY COMMENT -- NEITHER THEY WERE LYING OR THEY WERE HAD BETTER OVERHAUL AIR BASE (RICHARDS GEBAUEN) WHEN IT EXPLODED AND IT WENT BETWEEN OUR HOUSE AND THE AIR BASE.
I PRESSED THE AIR FORCE AS MUCH AS I COULD INTO A SEARCH FOR THE PARTS BECAUSE -- HERE WAS SOMETHING CHANCE TO OBTAIN POSITIVE EVIDENCE. A SIMILAR PLEA TO MR. GOODFELLOW, OUR DEAF GROUP FOR ACTION APPARENTLY FELL ON DEAF EARS.
SUMMARY OF ACTION AFTER SIGHTING
IMMEDIATELY AFTER SIGHTING AND EXPLOSION OF THE U.F.O. -- THE WRITER PHONED RADIO KDAP-TV. NO OTHER REPORTS HAD BEEN MADE BUT BOARD WAS LISTENING, INTERRUPTED OUR CONVERSATION SAYING THAT THE SWITCH BOARD WAS LIGHTING UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE, HE HUNG UP. 
I CALLED JOHNSON COUNTY (KANSAS) SHERIFF - HE ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS, GOT MY NAME AND ADDRESS.
THEN I CALLED RICHARD GEBAUER AIR FORCE BASE - AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES I GOT A PARTY TO TALK TO -- LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES DELAY - WHILE HE LOOKED FOR THE REPORT FORM -- (WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN FIVE PAGES LONG, THAT WOULD LIE CONVERSATION.
MY NEXT ACTION WAS TO SEARCH THE AREA (IT WAS DARK BY NOW) BY CAR AND INTERVIEWED PEOPLE IN THE AREA - ATTENDANTS AT DRIVE-IN, ETC. - NONE HAD SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING.
I FIGURED THAT IF THE CRAFT WAS OUR WITNESS, THE AIR FORCE IN EITHER CASE WOULD BE ALL OVER THE AREA LIKE A SWARM OF BEES -- MILITARTY PERSONNEL AND EVERYTHING.
I RETURNED HOME - ONE-AND-A-HALF HOUR LATER TO FIND THAT THE SHERIFF OR OTHER REPORTS -- THOUGH WE LEARNED HE GAVE SAME MAN HAD TOLD A NEIGHBOR THAT THEY HAD GIVEN SAME MAN HAD TOLD A NEIGHBOR THAT THEY HAD SEEN ANYTHING.

We had just gone to bed when the Air Force called - saying "one of your radars had picked up some unidentified blips". There were no planes in the area at the time and that there were no blips on radar.

A week had passed when a secretary from the Air Base called saying a certain sergeant wanted to talk to me - but he couldn't be in for several days. He did call - but he seemed more interested in how origin this Astronomer Club than our sighting.

Several weeks passed - and through friends active in the Navy League suggested that I call the chapter of the Navy League in our area which told us that he, while attending a convention, had been invited to join one of these groups. In addition, he was out; his assistant sent Col. Mercier to visit us - he inspected the University telescope. The assistant gave him bearing reports we noted but we pointed out to him that the U.F.O. probably was a comet. I drew pictures, etc. and signed them. He left - but seemed to be very interested in my drawings.

Since I had worked for the Bureau of Standards while an officer in the Navy I could at least get some experience. So I called him long distance, as he had said, several days of futile attempts.

I didn't expect him to remember me, the report or for that matter other previous contacts - with the problem, they seemed to be quite busy. I said "That's the reason I'm calling; I know very little evidence is and with five men at the sighting I'm calling to get copies of all reports made by the Air Force - and as soon as he was able to would let me know." I followed with a letter to remind him of our conversation. No answer, none to this day.

Since this experience with the authorities, my contacts have been with numerous investigators who indicate that while the Air Force and other relevant agencies have data and films, they are not released to the civilian authorities.

Since than, I have had a very delightful and informative forty-five minute talk with Dr. Allen Hynek of Northwestern, who is the only one I know for two investigators to any reporter for conversation. He will receive this report.

Proposed reply to letter from Congressman Winn, dated 14 May 69.

1. Reference the UFO sighting of 3 July 1967 from Kansas City, Kansas. After an initial investigation by the Project Blue Book Staff, it has been determined that the object seen by Mr. ______ was almost certainly a balloon, probably a Croname Tag Hot Air Balloon. (See attached description.)

2. Surface weather observations were requested from the United States Air Force Environmental Technical Applications Center (ETAC), Washington, D. C. and are as follows:

Kansas City 9:00 p.m. CDT (4/030302)
3/8 alto-cumulus coverage
Surface wind from 360° at 5 knots
Visibility - 15 miles 
Dew Point - 12°C

Kansas City 10:00 p.m. CDT (4/030302) 
Clear
Wind from 090° at 6 knots
Visibility - 15 miles
Temperature - 15°C
Dew Point - 11°C

3. Upper air data to 5000 ft was also requested. The closest upper air stations and closest times available were from:

Columbia, Missouri 7:00 p.m. CDT
Air in meters Direction Speed
630 From 3000 14 knots
1035 From 3000 16 knots
1527 From 3000 18 knots
2039 From 2000 19 knots

Topeka, Kansas 7:00 p.m. CDT
Air in meters Direction Speed  
630 From 300 6 knots
1035 From 310 8 knots
1527 From 315 13 knots
2039 From 320 19 knots

There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing text only.

Text output:

It is felt that the evaluation of balloon (Hot Air) is consistent with the description and flight characteristics of the object.

UFO Description and Flight Characteristics Comments
Wobble in flight (slight roll and pitch combined) Characteristic of balloon flight.
Wispy lines of vapor Probably smoke from burning heat source for balloon. 
Bright red-orange lights Heat sources.
Reflective surface Reflections from plastic bag.
50 ft in diameter Impossible to estimate unless diameter is known.
Explosion and debris 1. Possibly caused by a small directional charge attached to the balloon.
2. Possible misinterpretation of natural deterioration of balloon.
Lack of debris on the ground There would be little left of the balloon. It would not be as far away as observer estimated. Would tend to go unnoticed after descent due to the metallic debris.
Duration of about 5 minutes Surface wind southerly at about 5 knots.
Traveled due south Balloon would be an extremely poor indicator for radar.
No radar contact

5. On the basis of the above similarities, this sighting is to be carried under the balloon category in Project Blue Book files.

Dear Hector:

Thank you for your letter and its enclosure. I have recently retired from the Air Force, with the main objective of continuing my active research on the nature of the moon, a meeting of a committee of which I am chairman.

I found the cases you sent extremely interesting. I am particularly pleased with your resume on the Kansas City sighting. My only comment is that I would have replaced the word "possibly" by the word "probably" in the description.

Sightings - see no reason to get excited over the Kansas City sighting. It appears to be a common circuit breaker flashover on a power transmission line - a garment bag not air balloon, as suggested. The suggestion of a fine structure, of the event having been witnessed before the power of failure, the description sounds to me like a conventional power flashover rather than an unusual phenomenon.

I think that the failure of the Air Force to record any evidence or confirm any sighting - as they don't know what it was - however, the description given meets the criteria of the more usual electrical disturbance and is entirely consistent with their finding - "sighting down."

I think that the failure of the Air Force to record any evidence or confirm any sighting with the idea that these are extraterrestrial in origin is a little premature. A much more detailed and careful analysis of the physical evidence, if any, would be highly desirable before jumping to any conclusions.

Were the kind of phosphorescent sparks so characteristic of the explosion? I am certain that observations at this position were part of the explosion. Some of the falling debris could have exploded under the impact of the body landing.

The foregoing is my analysis for what it is worth. I

With reference to the Jefferson City sighting, I am certain of the interpretations which the principal observer or observers reported. 

Estimates of size and distance mean absolutely nothing. One cannot help but wonder about the man's eye condition. However, I was somewhat surprised that he said the object was as large as the moon. A person seeing such a reflection of the moon's surface could instantly recognize the characteristic featurso of the moon. At no time does he indicate that he stopped the car, got out and observed, or used binoculars or a telescope. Most certainly the question should have been asked, "If so, why didn't you stop the car?" Otherwise, how does he know it was the top down? Otherwise, how does he know it was the top down? Otherwise, how does he know it was the top down? Otherwise, how does he know it was the top down? Otherwise, how does he know it was the top down? Otherwise, how does he know it was the top down?

He should like to know what his information is that the lighting conditions were such that the object could have been easily visible and clearly seen. I do not think he must have been some of the UFO books that insist that such sightings are always of extraterrestrial origin.

It certainly could have been a plastic balloon, if so it could have been quite large in size, and visible for some distance. An a final comment, the statement in his interview about the means of his departure from the scene remains a mystery.

Scientists. And I am particularly surprised at his statement that he might have been closer to the object than I think. What he may have mistaken for mere observations might have been attempts to reach it. He claims to have had an experience while visiting a relative in the hospital, and that he almost lost his life in the process. Another thing that strikes me as peculiar in his resume is that someone only 25 years old claims to have 20-20 vision, but is this with or without glasses? For my evaluation, I would say that the object seen could very well have been anything, not necessarily a UFO. His reflexes are cleared up. I would not dismiss the possibility of hallucination. If there is anything to his story besides his own imagination, it is strongly suggest that someone other than Hytek ask the questions. He seems to be somewhat mentally disturbed, and I do not trust the judgement of the observer. Mental Health at one'S easy, for me, without any evidence other than in the files you have sent, to set back and try to determine what might have happened. I can be along way off, and I suggest some new leads and new thought. I shall be satisfied.

On UFO's, I am trying to get a book on them that shall want to get as much photographic material from you as I possibly can. With my very best regards and many thanks for your continued interest in my evaluations. I am

Cordially yours,

MEMO FOR RECORD
SUBJECT: UFO Sighting of 3 July 1969
23 MAY 1969 
1110 hrs EDT
Called Lt Col Mercier 
Richards-Gebaur AFB
Ext. 2668/2102

1. Col. Mercier stated that he did talk to Mrs. and that he had submitted this report to the 325th Fighter Group. The object, according to the witnesses, was about the size of a small plane. 
and the driver said that the object had exploded somewhere between his home and the dirt road where he had seen the object for a short time while driving home. Col. Mercier stated that there was some farm land to the south. He felt that if an object as described by the witnesses had exploded, it would have been seen by others and reported to the police department or the Col. Mercier, both of whom at least looked at the area where this explosion reportedly took place. Col. Mercier did think there have been a light plane which was landing at the State Line Airport, a small airport that is located on the Missouri-Kansas border. However, since the night manner of the sighting, he did not feel a small plane had landed at about the time of the sighting. He also stated that the sighting had been on the Missouri side of the area.

2. Col. Mercier stated that at the time he submitted his report to the 325th Fighter Group, the group was in the process of deactivating.

3. He also stated that he had recently received a letter from Washington, D.C. requesting that he try to locate the records of the sighting. He was unable to do so and has submitted his report to this office in Washington, D.C.

Dear General Murphy:

I would like to take this opportunity to request an official report from the Department of the Air Force with regard to their investigation of a reported sighting of an "unidentified flying object" on or about July 3, 1967 in the Kansas City, Kansas-Missouri area.

One of my constituents, Mr. [redacted] of Leawood, Kansas, has brought to my attention a report on his observations of this phenomenon, and it is my belief that the Air Force has similarly received other information regarding similar observations which have largely been ignored and laughed at over the years.

I am enclosing the entire file, which has been excellently prepared and is complete and comprehensive, in order to allow the Air Force to make a thorough and prompt investigation of this occurrence. This location is in close proximity of one of the largest and most important Air Force bases in the United States, and I strongly believe that the significance of this report demands acknowledgment and action.

Thank you for any assistance you may offer. As a member of the Science and Astronautics Committee here in the House, I am most interested in the UFO issue.

Most sincerely,
Larry Winn, Jr.
Member of Congress

Honorable Larry Winn

Dear Sir:

After spending some time with you, I am forwarded that I give you copies of the complete reports, letters, etc. relating to the sightings of a UFO from our residents in Leswood.

(You will note the complete indifference to this sighting by the) Air Force which I am pursuing this. It is the full belief that the UFO sighting here was of such inconsequential importance - while at the same time conscientious United States citizens have been ridiculed and suffered indignities.

Of most importance, in my opinion, of this particular sighting was the photographic possibility of recording hardware or proof of the existence of these objects. To my knowledge only one other such exploration has been seen and that was in Brazil. 

I would appreciate your comments and the opportunity to discuss briefly not only the contents and details of the report but my suggested plan for proper disposition.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

PREFACE

The following report was made to the proper authorities of the U.S. Air Force within minutes of the observation of the UFO and its final destruction on July 3, 1967.

Since then this report has been discussed with other interested persons and groups, such as Dr. Ed Condon, Col. Mercier, Dr. Allan Hynek.

I am hereby submitting this report to additional persons and groups to see if they have additional information and can vouch for its authenticity. I hope the U.S. Government will make an intensive full scale development program on these various devices if they don't Russian. A conscientious U.S. citizen has resulted in undue hardships and penalties because these people as they as openly misleading the American people.

I firmly believe we are far closer to the development of these unusual devices than is generally believed, and I have several ideas on this.

The U.F.O. sighted in this report exploded within sight of one of the largest and most important Air Force bases in the U.S.

U. S. A. G.
July 21, 1967

Briefly, the sighting occurred during a quiet family party on our patio at a prior residence. Several of our household and a neighbor. First, we noticed a bright red orange light brushing through the sky about 30 degrees from us over the woods. It was an object completely unlike anything we had ever seen. We ran for a set of binoculars and my wife observed the object through them. She could observe the object through the binoculars as well, but only the writer saw the object in the telescope-which proved difficult to train on the object due to its limited size.

The sun had set a few minutes before the sighting, and the sky was clear. No stars or comets were visible, (the Air Force included clouds and possible comets in their reports). The conditions were ideal, including the setting sun at our backs. 

The object appeared to draw on the attached sheet - two persons (one the writer) with binoculars were watching the object, as well as the other two observations. As it moved silently, it emitted a brush and a vapor trail, and we could see small houses on the Kansas side of the Missouri-Kansas State line 12 miles away from the center of Kansas City - disappearing behind the object as it moved across about 170 yards from our observation point - or almost due south.

The edges and surface were sharp and clear - bright metallic in color similar to polished stainless steel - reflections of green trees could be seen on the hull, nothing combined was unlike any known aircraft. However, it was traveling considerably faster than the wind, the only visible vapor or smoke trailing. The three very bright red orange lights appeared to be non-strobing - aircraft collision lights as they seemed to mark the shape. As it wobbled through the air - when the edge nearest us was up momentarily, we could not tell that it was shaped differently than a flat disk, except for the fact that the bright lights on the port and starboard quarters.

It appeared to be approximately 50-70 feet in diameter as one observer thought they saw small porthole's, where several did not - whether the sunlight was hitting the object at that point. The estimated altitude was not sure.

It is difficult if not impossible to estimate distance, size or speed when all are unknown, as the distance estimates would bring it at an airfield about four miles south. The diameter appeared to be about fifty feet if any.
