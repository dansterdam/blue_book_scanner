The image does not contain any photographs or visual depictions. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was the official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects. The document is a letter dated September 28, 1965, responding to a report about an aerial object observed on July 23, 1965. The letter states that the Air Force is unable to identify the specific satellite or satellites that were observed, but appreciates the report.

Text in the document:
Dear Miss __________,
This is in reply to your letter regarding an aerial object which you observed on 23 July 1965.
