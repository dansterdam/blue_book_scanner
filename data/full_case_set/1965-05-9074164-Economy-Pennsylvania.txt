JUL 29 1965

Dear Mr. Spaulding:

Reference is made to your specific question regarding the sightings of unidentified flying objects at Economy, Pennsylvania, on May 28, 1965.

The information received indicates that several persons reported seeing an object described as round or circular in shape, silent in operation and displaying no lights. This object was observed for a period of approximately 15 minutes and was first seen at around 9:45 p.m. on May 28, 1965. No further details are available concerning the object or its movements.

In view of the lack of substantiating evidence, we are unable to offer any definitive conclusions regarding this incident. The file has been placed in our inactive files, pending receipt of any additional information that may be developed. 

Sincerely,

JOHN F. SPAULDING
RECORDEI: USAF 
Chief, Civil Branch Division

SUBJECT: Request for UFO Information,

TO: Hq USAF SAFOI-GC (Mrs Hunt)
WARD D C 20330

Reference the attached letter from ___ requesting information on identified flying objects and submitting a photograph as provided in order that a reply may be made:

a. The present head of Project Blue Book is Major H Quintanilla, Jr.

b. The incident referred to in Frank Scully's book, "Behind Flying Saucers" is not based on fact. The Air Force had no corroboration with this alleged incident. The Air Force regards this book as fiction.

c. The fact sheet forwarded to Mr ___ in January 1965 contained the conclusions of Project Blue Book to date.

d. We have no other reports from the Pennsylvania area on 27 May 1965. At this late date specific identification of vehicles depicted would be extremely difficult. The characteristics of this sighting indicate that an aircraft moving at high speed, providing inadequate visual observation time, could account for the phenomena.

WASHINGTON, D. C. (20330)

Dear Sir:

I know you are quite busy, so I will not waste your time. I am writing to you for two reasons. The request from me for a copy of the project "BLUEBOOK" and to report a U.F.O.

Enclosed you will find my report on the U.F.O., which was sighted on June 8, 1965.

First of all I would like to know who is the head of(in charge of) project BLUEBOOK - investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects. Could you please send me the name and address of the chief of this project.

On about 9:00PM on June 8, 1965 I was referred to in Frank Seully's book "BEHIND THE FLYING SAUCERS" as a witness (p.149). I was referred to in Frank Seully's book "Behind the Flying Saucers" (p.149) as a witness. The Case was supposed to have happened in 1949. According to the book, they found metal pieces and photographs with the case, which I do not recall all details - it is evidently crashed here. it was also stated that it is strongly supported. I do not fully understand - but it never mentioned what became of the vehicle and the bodies - and what conclusions were drawn by the Air Force regarding this.

I know you probably consider me a "curious at watcher" but I would appreciate it very much if you would send me the name and address of the chief of project BLUEBOOK, as I am very interested in such matters and study them.

I would appreciate if you can send me regarding this matter (not restricted by security measures). Thank you.

Yours truly,
Baden, Penna. (15005)

U.F.O. SIGHTER REPORT
DATE (sighted): 27 May 1965
LOCATION: Economy Borough, Pennsylvania (in vicinity of Baden-Economy Jr. High School and Conway, Penn.)
OBJECTS at Union school, Economy, Penna., first seen to a point NW where it could no longer be seen.
TIME: The object appeared about 9:30 P.M. (Daylight Saving Time)—local
TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground visual
PHOTOS: none
SOURCE: civilian observers
LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: approx. 90 seconds
NUMBER OF OBJECTS: one (composed of several parts)
COURSE AND SPEED: Time to NW, appeared to travel at high speed with periodic or intermittent acceleration.
DESCRIPTION: Color appeared to be a glowing white. Object appeared to be a single unit but had a number (5 or 6) of small, bright "fins" or protrusions extending from the central body. The object appeared to be spinning or rotating and also appeared to be accelerating and decelerating or pulsing in its flight. NO SOUND was heard. The object appeared to travel from left to right (as observed), then appeared to stop and hover briefly, then accelerated and continued on its course.
COMMENTS: Observers (both age 17) on way back to Parkline Ice or home to Economy?—saw the object. At first glance, they thought it was a "shooting star" but soon saw that it was a revolving, glowing object. It appeared to be at a low altitude. One observer stated that he saw it suddenly disappear, then reappear a short distance away. The other observer stated that as it was disappearing, it seemed to go out in sections, as if parts of it were blinking out. The object was observed for approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute. The used 7-30 binoculars to view the object, which appeared less distinct at a distance.

PERSONAL CONCLUSIONS:
First U.P.O. seen by either observer. Highly unlikely object sighted; was estimated through some years in the same size as an advertizing plane - not resembling anything celestial body (star, moon, etc.)

I know we should have reported it to the nearest Air Force Base, but was busy and unable to report before.

Illustration:
The illustration shows a diagram with a circular object labeled "Observation" and a linear object labeled "S" and "E", potentially representing the observed UFO and its flight path.
