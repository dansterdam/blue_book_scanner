Note:
a sighting was reported at 8:35 p.m., CST, on March 6, 1958, at Ogallala, Nebraska, by two citizens - Mr. Bob Jacobs and Mr. Warnecke. According to the report, they observed a bright light in the sky which made a sharp turn, as though to pursue another object which was flying at a much higher altitude. The light maintained a steady course, flying in a southerly direction, and appeared to be some 4,000 to 5,000 feet in altitude. The witnesses estimated the speed of the object as being approximately 1,000 mph. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 seconds before disappearing from sight.

There does not appear to be any photograph in this image. The image contains handwritten text that appears to be an incident report or other document related to Project Blue Book.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:
The object was southwest of the witness. It was as bright as the bright star Sirius and approximately 2 to 3 times larger than a star. The object moved southwest to northeast and made no noise.
This report is submitted because of the possibility that it may have been some type of aircraft or object of scientific interest. Although the witness thought it might have been a jet, no sound was heard, and its movement did not resemble that of a jet aircraft. Thus, there remains the possibility that this was some type of unusual aerial phenomena.

(Airplane type fighter-type that the object was thought to have resembled) were with colors that they described as being very brilliant in color like newly minted silver dollars. The object 
appeared to be round in shape, about 40 to 50 feet in diameter, and about 2,000 feet in the air, and approaching them at a high rate of speed. The visual observation was only for a matter of 3 or 4 seconds, about how long it took the object to pass them. They believe the object was artificial craft of some kind because of its brilliance, size, speed, and maneuverability. The observers were (name illegible) and (name illegible).
