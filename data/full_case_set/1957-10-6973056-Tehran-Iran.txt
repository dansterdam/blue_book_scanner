AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DATE: 25 Oct 57	
PLACE: Tehran, Iran
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object
REFERENCES: None
REPORTING UNIT: Air Defense Command, Tehran, Iran
EVALUATION: Unknown
DETAILS:
1. On the night of 18-19 September 1957, at approximately 0120 hours local time, the control tower operator at Mehrabad Airport, Tehran, Iran, observed an extremely bright light in the sky, which appeared to be moving in the general direction of the airport. The light was estimated to be about 3 to 4 times the brightness of the planet Venus.
2. The light was observed for approximately 50 minutes, during which time it approached to within a distance of 40 to 50 kilometers southwest of the airport, hovered for a short time, then accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view to the north. During this period, the light appeared to be circular in shape, and at times it seemed to double in size. The light also dimmed and brightened intermittently.
3. At about 0125 hours, a jet interceptor was scrambled to investigate the light. The pilot reported that as he approached the object, his radio and instruments went off, and the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared, regaining his instruments as it went out of sight. A second scramble also failed to make visual contact with the object.
4. This information was sent by our DIA in liaison with the Air Attache in Ankara, Turkey, and the air staff in the United States. Classification Cancelled
By authority of the  DP
