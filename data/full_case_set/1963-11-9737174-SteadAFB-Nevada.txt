According to the report, at 5:20 p.m. the witness observed a disc-shaped object, about 30 feet in diameter, hovering in the southwestern skies. The object was tremendous in size, hovering at about 1,000 feet altitude. It had a golden cast and appeared to be made of a metallic material. The witness stated that it had "an odd green color with a golden cast," and was lighted from within. The witness runs an electronic repair shop and stated that he first noticed the object from a window of his home. It had "an odd green color with a golden cast" and was lighted from within.
