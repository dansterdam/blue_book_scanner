Date (Local): 24 Jan 61
Hour (Local): 1909 & 2000
Hour (Z Time Group): 2202Z
Satellite: (Det 5 ATIC, Ext 3279) 
Astronomical Phenomena (Meteor, Comet, Planet, etc): PLANET -PLANET
Natural Phenomena (Ball Lightning, etc): _____
Aircraft, Balloons, Airships, etc: _____
Other: POWER FAILURE
Evaluation of Source Reliability: UNKNOWN
Analysis and Conclusions:
The course of this unusual object and its movement was followed by the crew, who were quite certain that it was not a meteor or satellite. The object first appeared in the west and moved rapidly to the east, where it changed direction and moved back toward the west. The apparent size of the object was approximately half the diameter of the full moon. The object eventually disappeared in the eastern sky after an unusual maneuver. The observers were quite certain that this was not a normal astronomical phenomenon.
