Tiny Circuits Cut and
Pierced By Electron Beam
THE ELECTRON beam much
cuts and drills circuits on
silicon and germanium chips
for electronic components.
The electron cutter-welder works like
e electric tool, cutting and piercing the
circuits. The beam leaves no debris, and
it is possible to lay down circuit patterns
much smaller than possible with ordinary
electrical techniques.
The process of etching circuits on
silicon semiconductor chips by using a
focused electron beam to remove se- lected
areas has been pioneered by the General
Electric Company at Schenectady, N.Y.
Ocean Rivets Measure
By Depth-Seo Devices
OCEAN CURRENTS will be
measured accurately with new
depth-sounding devices developed by the U.S. Navv's
Bureau of Ships and the National
Oceanographic Data Center. These new
units are claimed to measure depth to 0.1%
of the deepest reading, as compared to 7‰
accuracy possible heretofore. The units
measure at any depth, velocity and direction
of currents. Data are collected on 15 inch
magnetic tapes and later analyzed by computer. This method will sharply improve
knowledge of ocean currents.
Earth's Crust Found
Thicker in Colorado
THE EARTH'S CRUST is 30 miles thick
in eastern Colorado, only 10 miles thick in
California. New measurements by the U.S.
Geological Survey, using seismologically
detected boundary surfaces, indicate the land
profile of the earth's crust in the western
United States is 40 to 45 miles thick under
the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, but only
20 to 25 miles thick in California.

The conclusions about the earth's crust
are based on a net,
work of about
2,000 seismic stations in the western
United States. The
new evidence from
eastern Colorado
confirms earlier estimates from eastern Colorado
that the crust there is thicker than previ-
ously thought.
BIOLOGY
Tiny Yeasts Survive
30 Years in Antarctica
AND the living units from the bodies of
bacteria have survived more than 30 years
in the frozen soil of the Antarctica, and
have been revived after being sealed in glass
ampoules since the expeditions of Admiral
Byrd to the Little America base in the early
1930's.

The frozen and dried bacterial cells,
stored under seal in the Antarctic from a
time when President Hoover was in office,
have been cultured in the laboratories of the
University of California at Berkeley, where
scientists report two types of yeasts, a kind
of mold and other microorganisms have
been grown from this ancient material.

The food cache, in which the jars of yeast
and bacteria were sealed, was destroyed, but
the bacterial matter in the sealed glass containers was preserved. The story was related
in Science, January 25, 1963.

ROBERTSVILLE, OHIO:(2 miles south) 2/2/63
TIME: 4:00 TO 4:30 PM - A husband and wife watched an object moving VERY SLOWLY and erratic. It was first 100 feet from the ground, then very bright bluish white light flashing irregularly and some times it would submerge in darkness. This object shaped like an egg. There were no sounds. We called the Akron-Canton Airport, they had no information on it.

SAUCERS IN THE NEWS

Blenheim, New Zealand, February 9, 1963. On this date a housewife looked up into the sky and observed what she estimated to be 15 inches in diameter, and they were a similar shape to saucers, but larger than lenticular clouds. At first she could only see two objects, but later she counted six or more. The objects were moving at a steady rate westward and upward, but later they appeared to be moving slowly. Although the witness was not sure, she estimated the object's altitude at 10,000 feet. The witness shows an interested attitude toward this subject and contacted the office of the NICAP New Zealand Newsletter: March-April, via Robert J. Gribble. (Source: NICAP reports.)

He did not attempt to make physical contact with the object. The sightings were made in February. He says he was walking near some woods when he saw a huge, round luminous object. He claims that there have not been any of these pictures, which must be quite sensational if they existed.

Glendale, California, February 5, 1963. A UFO was spotted shortly before noon in the Hollywood area. Several persons in Glendale saw the object, but they knew of no weather balloons in the area. Although they had received several calls reporting the object, officials and the Federal Aviation Agency could not identify it. Witness J. Scribner, who works for Air Defense Command, described the object as maneuvering rapidly and of a silvery metallic appearance, but as far as he knew, no aircraft were in the area at about 11:45 A.M. Yet planes were sighted minutes after the object was seen. Officials are still investigating this incident. (Source: California.UFO.)

NOV-DEC 65

Alberti (Province of Buenos Aires)
According to the Flying Saucer Review report, at 6:30 p.m. of that same day, they were surprised as they were standing in a field, when a luminous object of elliptical form appeared in the sky traveling at high speed. It stopped at a short distance from the ground. They stopped and got out to look at it. The object remained stationary for a few minutes. It then resumed its fast speed and disappeared. The witnesses stated that, judging by the size and brightness of the object as seen from the ground, they estimate it to have been about 15 meters in diameter and emitting an intense white light. They had the impression that the object had turned off its light. The witnesses rushed to pick up the paper to have printed a news article, but could not find a copy of it.

He estimated the light to be about 30,000 feet and said it appeared to be a spherical object and was descending at a steep angle. He stated the object was about the size of a basketball and seemed to be surrounded by a bluish haze. After the object got lower, he said, it vanished. Mr. Consel stated he had never seen anything like this before and that it was a complete mystery to him. 2/15/63: IR Robert Gribble."

CHARLIE BREW, On February 16th, 1963 at approximately 10.00 p.m. he observed a luminous object in the sky to the south-east of his home in Winslow, Arizona. He stated that the object was like a globe of white light and seemed to be about 100 yards in diameter. He said that the object remained stationary for a few minutes, then moved slowly in a northwesterly direction and disappeared. He added that the object seemed to rotate as it moved and made a whooshing sound, according to Mr. Brew.

The image shows a single photograph. The photograph appears to be a blurry, grainy image of some object in the sky. The text below the image indicates that the image was taken by the pilot of a jet aircraft and shows an object that was sighted during a flight over Winslow, Arizona on February 28, 1963.

Colonel Nash of the Liaison Office (?) at the House of Representatives called to report a sighting over Winslow, Arizona on 28 February 1963.
The sighting took place from 3:30 to 6:30 PM Pacific Standard Time. Seen by the pilot of a jet aircraft and congress man John Hall Williams (a former Air Force officer).
Altitude was given as 40 degrees - 60 miles.
The object appeared as a "ring in the sky."
Colonel Nash would like to speak with you. His number is Oxford 7-3715.

The article discusses how the appearance of a "saucer" or unidentified flying object caused panic in a herd of cattle. The article describes the cattle as "milling about in a confused state" and running about erratically after seeing the object. The article suggests that the saucer-like object caused the cattle to panic, though the exact cause is not definitively known.

JAPA PRESENTS A SPECIAL REPORT ON
WILLOW GROVE, AUSTRALIA SIGHTING
FEBRUARY 15, 1963

(Editors Note: On the 15th of February of this year, Mr. Charles Brew
reported to JAPA that he had a full report of a UFO sighting over his dairy farm.
The original account of Mr. Brew's sighting was published in our June 1963 issue.)

(Continued from front page)
Mr. Brew and Mr. Peter Norris, president of U.F.O.S.I.R.S., along with the transcript of the tapes, asked us to publish the results of the interview we had with Mr. Brew on February 15th, together with photocopies of the letters and drawings).

Q. Could you tell me about the object as you first made your sighting?
A. It would be about 10 past 7, it was. Yes, 10 past 7, definitely. 
Q. Can you describe the object as you first saw it?
A. Yes. How did I notice the object? Some down? I was - through I'd say - through I'd say,
Q. Yes. How did you notice the object? Something caught your eye, I presume?
A. Yes, something caught my eye, and it was like - and it was fairly low - fairly low and it
Q. And what did the object look like when you first saw it?
A. Well, what made me think that there was something - it was an unusual object - was the fact that it wasn't an aeroplane or a satellite or anything that I'd ever seen before. Ever seen one of these.
Q. What did it look like?
A. Well, it wasn't like anything I'd ever seen before. It was sort of - well, I couldn't really make out the shape of it - but it seemed to change shape as it went along. It wasn't round or - or oval or anything like that. It was just - well, it was an unusual object.
Q. Can you give me an idea of the size of the object?
A. Well, I'd say it was about the size of a large car from where I was standing. Of course, I couldn't be certain, you know - that's only an estimate. 
Q. Yes, and about the same distance from you as a large car would be?
A. Yes, that would be quite right. It was about the same distance as a large car would be.
Q. And what color was it?
A. Well, it had a bit of a metallic sheen to it. It seemed to be made of some sort of metallic material. It wasn't - it wasn't one solid color, it seemed to change as it moved along.
Q. And what direction was it traveling in?
A. Well, it came in from my left - from the west - and it was heading in a northerly direction. 
Q. And can you give me an idea of the speed it was traveling at?
A. Well, it certainly wasn't traveling as fast as a jet plane or anything like that. It was - it was more of a steady, uniform speed, not real fast, but not real slow either. I'd say it was probably traveling at something like 300 to 400 miles an hour, perhaps.
Q. And how long did you observe the object for?
A. Well, I'd say about 2 to 3 minutes, maybe a little longer. It just seemed to glide along at a steady pace.
Q. And what happened to the object then?
A. Well, after 2 or 3 minutes, it just seemed to accelerate and disappear off into the distance. It just took off at tremendous speed and was gone.
Q. And did the object make any sound that you could hear?
A. No, none at all. It was completely silent. That's what really struck me about it - the fact that there was no sound coming from it at all.
Q. And after the object disappeared, did you do anything about reporting the sighting?
A. Yes, I did. I contacted the local police station and reported what I had seen. They said they would pass the information on to the appropriate authorities.
Q. And did you subsequently hear anything more about the sighting from the authorities?
A. No, I didn't. I never heard anything more about it from them.

Transcription of the text in the document:

A. Oh, I'd say overall, about 5 feet, as near as I could judge. Might have been a bit taller.
Q. What color was it?
A. It was a kind of silvery gray color, as I remember it. I really can't say for certain.
Q. You didn't actually see anybody in it through what appeared to be the glass portions?
A. No, I didn't. I can honestly say that I didn't see anybody, although there may have been somebody in it for all I know.
Q. I can honestly say that I didn't see anybody either, although it certainly seemed to be what I could consider a living creature or what I would take to be a machine - which seemed to be making some kind of intelligent movements.
Q. And when it took off, what did you notice? Well, first of all, as it took off, it did a strange maneuver.
A. Yes, and then after that, it took off, and it - and if you - at what speed would you say it went away?
Q. Well, I'd say it went away at a tremendous speed, much faster than anything I ever saw before. And I wonder if there is any possibility of your being mistaken in your estimate of the size?
A. It could be. I'm not an expert at judging sizes, you know, not a flying saucer expert, and I wouldn't want to say positively that it was so many feet high or wide. It seemed to be an aerial sort of thing, and I'd say about 5 feet, but I could be mistaken.
Q. What time of day was this?
A. It was about 11:30 in the morning, I think. I'm pretty sure it was before noon, around mid-morning.
Q. How many persons were there?
A. Well, we were halfway, half of them were skilled out and the other half were just interested observers, you might say. They came over everything to see.
Q. What sort of clothing did the men have on?
A. Well, as far as I could see, they seemed to be in their work clothes. They come around to see this thing, whatever it was. They were dressed just the way they would be dressed for their regular work.
Q. Did they seem to be employees of any particular plant or organization?
A. Well, I don't know, I couldn't tell, I couldn't say. They were just ordinary people, and when this thing happened, they came over to look at it.
Q. Did you talk to any of them?
A. Yes, I did talk to some of them, and they said they had never seen anything like it.
Q. Have you been interviewed by any representatives of the government? (Interview continued.)

Transcribing the text from the document:

Australian Report - (Continued)

A. Yes, as I said, the C.S.I.R.O. (Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organization) is the organization that they were concerned about trying to get help from. They were concerned that it was so ridiculous, they would have a difficult time getting any attention.

Q. But what did the report itself say? Do you know the contents of it?

A. Well, it was just saying that they had had an experience, and they were concerned about it. But they did not have any proof. There was just the report itself, which they said was just off itself towards the night - it took all day long.

Q. And when you were talking about the "weather canopy" business, I noticed it.

Q. What did the C.S.I.R.O. man say? Incidentally, do you know his name? What's his name?

A. Any name that I used was quite fictitious - I do not know the name. As I have had the impression, from what they had told me, they were always had the impression that it might have been a member of the organization, but they were never sure.

Q. What did the object look like, and what did it do?

A. Well, they said it was a sort of an inverted saucer type. It may have some attraction around it, and it came in close and then went out again very rapidly.

Q. How long after this thing occurred did the C.S.I.R.O. come down here?

A. That's a good question. I believe it was only a matter of a week or or 10 days after the event, that the C.S.I.R.O. came down in a small plane to interview these people.

Q. Will the Air Force come down the same way, do you know?

A. I have no information about any Air Force interest. The only people I know about is the C.S.I.R.O. who came down to interview these people.

Q. May they were all scared, these witnesses, or very nervous, or something?

A. Yes, they were all very nervous and fearful, because as they said, they had always had the impression that they would be thought of as cranks by others, if they reported this.

Q. What did they photograph the surrounding country - that was the new base, Mt. McKinley, I believe. Do you know how much blue was showing in the sky - all that sort of thing. It's a bit hard to tell because the photograph is a bit obscure.

A. I'm sorry, I have no information about any photographs. They did not mention anything about photographing the surrounding countryside or anything else in connection with this incident.

Q. Well, they had the cameras, and they were snapping rocks, and took particular notice of that. I understand that they saw objects like this over other countries, and it tallied almost exactly to what's been seen over there, but they hesitated about reporting it because of what may happen.

A. I have no information about any photographs or about them observing similar objects over other countries. The only thing they reported to me was the single incident that occurred in the local area.

Q. That was in Australia, was it?

A. No, this incident did not occur in Australia. It occurred in the country concerned in this report.

Q. Did the Australian Government do anything about it?

A. As far as I know, the Australian Government did not become involved in this particular case. I had no information about any government involvement.

Q. I had the aeronautical expert from here, I think, Damon officer, I think that was his name, but I'm not sure. He said he was asked to go and investigate it, and he went there. Do you know anything about that?

A. No, I have no information about any aeronautical expert from here being involved in investigating this particular incident. The only people I know of who were involved were the representatives from the C.S.I.R.O. organization.

Q. To get back to the object itself, did you notice any light coming from the object?

A. There was no mention made by the witnesses of any light or other observable characteristics of the object, other than the general description that it was a sort of inverted saucer type.

Dear Madam,

1. Referring to your letter dated 14th March, 1963, regarding the request for information, I regret to inform you that as indicated by the Director of Electronic Warfare Research, Headquarters Joint Intelligence Bureau, the Department of Air has no conclusive evidence to substantiate the existence of unidentified flying objects.

2. However, we are aware that there are reports of sightings of unusual aerial phenomena in many ways similar to those objects classed as unidentified flying objects. The Department of Air is continuing to investigate these reports as diligently as possible.

3. I accept this opportunity to emphasize to you that while the Department of Air is sympathetic to your interest in this matter, we are unable to do more than record reports and endeavour to identify the source of the sightings. Our firm conclusion is that the nature of the object or phenomenon observed cannot be satisfactorily determined.

Yours faithfully,

16 FEBRUARY 1963 
WINSLOW, OHIO

LOCAL SIGHTINGS: PURSUANT TO 2/6/63 RM, 
A HUSBAND AND WIFE, WERE DRIVING SOUTH ON 
HIGHWAY 77. THEY RECALLED FROM 6:00-6:15 PM. 
THEY NOTICED A VERY LARGE, LIGHT-COLORED 
OBJECT TO THE SOUTH OF THE ROADWAY OVERHEAD. 
IT APPEARED TO BE HEADING WEST OUT OF THE AREA 
TO OBSERVE IT. WHEN FIRST SEEN, THE WITNESS
THOUGHT IT WAS AIRPLANCE, BUT SUDDENLY REALIZED
IT WAS MOVING RAPIDLY, BUT SILENTLY AND INCONSISTENT- 
LY WITH ANY AIRCRAFT. THE OBJECTS SIZE WAS LIKE 
AN 80 FOOT SAUCER. THEY ESTIMATED THE SAUCER
TO BE AT AN ALTITUDE OF 300 FEET AND ABOUT 500 
FEET AWAY. ELEVATION, APPROXIMATELY 20-25 DEGREES 
ABOVE THE HORIZON. SPEED, APPROXIMATELY 900 MPH. 
DURATION, THE WITNESSES WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 3 
MINUTES BEFORE IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT AND THEY LOST
IT FROM VIEW. THE OBJECT, AS DESCRIBED, WAS LIKE
A LARGE, BRILLIANT "LIGHT", ROUNDISH IN SHAPE 
AND SLIGHTLY CONVEX ON TOP AND BOTTOM. IT HAD A 
DEFINITE GLOW ALL AROUND THE RIM. COLOR OF THE 
GLOW WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF A FLUORSCENT LIGHT. 
JUST BEFORE DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW, THE OBJECT
STOPPED MOMENTARILY AND THEN TOOK OFF AGAIN AT AN
EXTREMELY HIGH SPEED GOING FROM SIGHT. THE WIFE
THEN PHONED THE NEWS TO HER PARENTS. AND THEY IN
TURN NOTIFIED THE LOCAL POLICE AND OTHER OFFICIALS
WHO WERE UNABLE TO VERIFY THE SIGHTINGS. IN FACT, 
IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NO ONE ELSE IN THE AREA HAD 
REPORTED SEEING THE OBJECT OR PHENOMENON. AS A 
RESULT, I THERE WAS LITTLE ELSE OF VALUE THAT COULD 
BE DETERMINED FROM THIS REPORT. IT WAS, HOWEVER,
INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THIS CASE AS DESCRIBED IS 
IN KEEPING WITH THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCI-
ATED WITH SIGHTINGS OF THIS NATURE.

Maiden, North Carolina. February 18, 1963. Flying Master and another witness said they say UFOs over Maiden, North Carolina on that morning. The object(s) were flying at an estimated 15,000 feet and were moving in and out of formation at a tremendous speed. "They appeared to be under intelligent control. At one time the object(s) appeared to be in a burst of speed. They left no trail of smoke. 
The local newspaper representative was given further information by Mr. Norstog, a resident of Maiden. He said he saw the objects. This looked metallic & were flat on top. The red lights on the objects were blinking on and off at a rapid rate, according to Mr. Norstog.
UFOs were seen leaving at an altitude around 15,000 feet shortly after daylight on the morning of February 18th, 1963 [sic]. First the local newspaper correspondent was told they were seen by two persons, then would say 4 or 5 minutes. At that time they would have not motion or speed. They left no trail of smoke.

SAUCERS IN THE SKY

Belgrade, Montana, February 22, 1963: As an object described as "a strange red ball of fire," was seen by Bill DeBad of Bozeman, Montana, at approximately 2:30 A.M. that morning. Telephones were disturbed and local citizens, who observed this strange object, said it hovered over their homes for several minutes and then disappeared. When police officers said they could find no trace of the object after coating the area, DeBad told them he had taken a photograph of it while it was still in the air (confidence would indicate the police cannot confirm this).

A "strange red ball of fire" of the type seen by Bill DeBad of Bozeman, Montana, at approximately 2:30 A.M. on February 22, 1963. As he was driving home from work, this object was pacing his car as it went by. He said it was about the size of a basketball and that it landed about 200 feet from his vehicle. However, when he stopped to investigate, it disappeared, leaving no trace.

Record Breaking Cloud Formation Over Southwest
At sunset on February 28, 1963, an extraordinary, ring-shaped cloud was observed over Arizona, New Mexico and California. It was seen as far south as Winslow, Arizona, Albuquerque in the north, and Los Angeles in the west. It stretched over approximately 500 miles.
Studies conducted by University of Arizona Atmospheric Physics Lab Chief Dr. James E. McDonald showed its height to be approximately 35,000 feet with a diameter of 15 kilometers, considerably higher than the normal cloud layers.
It became apparent that the odd phenomenon was luminous and not just reflecting the sun. The upper sections of the cloud were composed of water droplets or ice crystals at 42 kilometers, considerably higher than the diffused corona. The shimmering effect or "mother-of-pearl" are usually observed only at altitudes of 100,000 feet, being shapeless and formed by air moving up over mountain ranges in a region of severe cold.
According to Dr. McDonald's conversation with Dr. MacDonald, Mrs. Lorensen was informed that the high-flying vehicle might account for the formation but to date the origin of the cloud has not been determined. It has been speculated that it could be the result of an undisclosed experiment or of extraterrestrial origin.

The image appears to be a photograph of a stratospheric cloud formation over southern Arizona. The text describes the unusual ring-shaped cloud structure that was observed and photographed on four occasions from Tucson, Arizona, with the most distant observation reported being 160 miles from the cloud. The cloud appeared to remain stationary for 35 minutes after local sunset, and its unusual size and structure are noted. No human faces or identities are visible in this image.

Stratospheric Cloud over
Southern Arizona

Abstract: An unusual ring-shaped
cloud was observed and photographed
over southern Arizona on four occasions
during the period 28 February 1963 to
12 March 1963. Reports of its appearance
are known to have appeared elsewhere
during this period, but no additional
information is available. The cloud was
observed on four photos taken in Tucson, 130
miles south of the cloud, in distinct
angles. The diameter of the cloud is estimated
to have been about 40 kilometers.
The most distant observation reported was
made 160 miles from the cloud. The
cloud remained stationary for about
35 minutes after local sunset. Iridescence was noted
by some observers. The
unusual shape, size, and brightness of the
cloud tended to be reminiscent of
a macroeus cloud: but its unusually great
height and brightness for a stratospheric
cloud suggest it may have been in the
nature of an atmospheric distortion or
anomaly.

Near sunset, on 28 February 1963, a
cloud of unusual configuration and coloration was observed in widely scattered
locations in Arizona and Springerville,
New Mexico (some 15C miles east
of Flagstaff, Arizona). At about 180 miles
east of Flagstaff this cloud as seen against
the sun, which had already set (R.E. Daniels, Springerville, Arizona).
The observers saw this long, thin, running
cloud pass before the sun, making a
bright Illuminated wall after the sun
had set on the horizon. Close comparison 
of this cloud with the sunset
sky to the south. its angular elevation appeared
to be rather (3 degrees). A rough geometric
construction (1) made immediately after
the cloud entered the scene showed a
elliptical ring-shaped configuration similar
to a horseshoe. Attempts were made
for confirmatory reports in order to
establish the approximate location and
dimension of this unusual cloud formation.

From approximately 130 reports,
many communicated by persons in
widely scattered locations, the unique
cloud unprecedented in years of sky-
watching is was quickly established to
have been observed over a wide area in the
vicinity of Flagstaff, Arizona, that it
exhibited characteristics of the rare altoCumulus
cloud formation (Ac 3), and that it
interacted strangely with the sun.to produce
striking color effects. The cloud appeared
green and blue ware visible, and a
pinkish cast was noted at times in
the cloud shape. The unusually great
height, diameter, and "wood grain"
appearance, was present
over much of its northern extent, but

The image provided appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a chart or diagram depicting the planet Mars and its position relative to Earth. There is no photograph present in this particular image.

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

ASTRONOMY

Mars Now Closest to Earth

The red planet Mars, closer than it has been for two years, shines brilliantly in the evening sky, James Stokley reports.

MARS, in the constellation Scorpio, is now shining with a distinctly red color. This near-earth visitor is now closer to the earth than it has been for two years. On Feb. 25, when it will be only 62,000,000 miles away, it will be nearer than at any other time until 1965. At that time, Mars will be the nearest on Feb. 10, when it will be 54,600,000 miles from the earth.

This is a favorable opposition of Mars, when the planet is on the same side of the sun as the earth. It is nearer to us than when it is in conjunction, when it is on the opposite side of the sun. The chart shows the positions of Mars and the earth in their orbits.

Mars is in Cancer. This is the constellation of Cancer, which is not a very conspicuous group of stars, and which does not include any very bright stars. But in the southern sky it is Regulus, the heart of the Lion, a first-magnitude star, which stands boldly above Mars, and somewhat to its right.

Higher and to the right of the great dog star, Sirius, is the constellation Orion, with its three stars in a row, known as Orion's Belt. Below Orion is the brilliant Procyon, and below that is the star Sirius, the dog star, James Stokley says.

Though Mars is the only planet shown, the chart also indicates the positions of some of the other planets. The symbols for the order of brightness are shown along the bottom.
