Dear ------

Your observation of floating visible plasma is an interesting sighting and is in line with the general characteristics of sightings of this nature.

Similar observations which have been reported on many occasions indicate unusual phenomena under certain conditions.

Your observations of circular, hovering, and several high-speed maneuvers from cloud origin and various luminous characteristics, correspond to other sightings during the latter part of the fall of 1953.

The Air Force appreciates your contribution to this program and will aid this unique observation to become part of the overall studies of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

Your observation of floating thistle blooms is indeed an interesting case and is falls into the general category of evaluations of reported "angel hair".

Similar observations which have been reported on many occasions included migrating spider web, rayon residue from broken down articles of clothing, and natural phenomena which appear to descend from the sky and vanish. The appearance which you described in your sighting during the latter part of 1963. 

The Air Force appreciates your contribution to this program and will this contribution to the various studies of unidentified flying objects.

Also, it is unusual for most private citizens to have a feeling for the complexities and difficulties of the occasional UFO reports. Again, this is just one of the many problems which confront the Air Force in evaluating and processing UFO reports. Again, we appreciate your interest and contribution.

Sincerely,

It is my belief that the UFO seen on the clear photo from the different cross-winds or currents on a lake is entirely true. I am inclosing two sets of bloom & perhaps it dried through, thrown into the air. It is a large well-defined object, and with the trail of electric fans. You may have the same picture I sent. I'm not inclosing this for what I have in mind - having a hefty on your findings.

Right to the air wave for November 1, 1963 
Information, SAFH-PB
Wilmington, Del.

My dear sir:
On October 3, 1963 I was sick in bed, 12 y+8 M old, 5 feet 11 inches weighing 220 Ibs. The 0 air time. 9:00 a.m. 9:20 a.m. my TV set operate ABNORMALLY WELL. True it was that I have been 117 days away END. 24 years since I was. 
Station air, AP radio news and WELM Wilmington local newscast, within 5 minutes 3 events unrelated happened all similer, in EVERY DETAIL.
There was in reality an Air Force maneuver over many farm fields in Brandywine Hundred, Del. 

Where I may a sketch Air Force activities over my farm field. This is a TRUE statement, on U.F.O. U.F.O. the term "unidentified flying object" is not properly USed for this incident. Suffice it to say, that I observed a LIGHTED craft, that was ROUND DISCOID SHAPED, no portholes or openings, that hovered at 150 to 200 feet above the ground and was ILLUMINATED. This craft seem to be operating by SOUNDLESS POWER.
I watched this CRAFT, (which did make no engine SOUND WHAT SO EVER) for about 30 minutes, Estimating its diameter to approximately 60 to 70 feet. When it was leaving, it moved in a southeasterly direction, the LIGHTING going out COMPLETELY and it disappeared at a high rate of speed and altitude, like a FALLING STAR. 
I definitely believe here was a scientific experiment or MANIFESTATION performed over my farm on Oct. 3, 1963. There were no unusual happenings when it departed. The very next day, Oct. 4, 1963, I informed the U.S.F.O. Headquarters at Andrews A.F.B.

My dear Major:

The U.F.O.
My latest of 1-16-65, enclosing negatives as requested, because it appears to have been a large flame, with many lights, and noise - had a strange tail about 15ft long, same as my sighting on 12-23-64, with a flare in the sky over my garage and some sort of projecting from it, about 90 ft high over Bald Mt., Va., which I guess was 8 miles away. The flame itself did not appear to be as wonderful as the other, not moving quite so rapidly.
That which did not report as unusual -
one case which I shall log day for 1963, I was disturbed by the motion near the door of my garage, thinking 8 feet flying saucer with a flapping or oscillating motion, similar to the thing about 10 O'clock position on the sky, and within 2 seconds I did hear out of the 4 ft south next to my house. It was high speed, but flashy, up over Bald Mt., Va., which was 8 miles away.
