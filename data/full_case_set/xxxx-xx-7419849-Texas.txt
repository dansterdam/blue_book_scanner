Gentlemen:
I would like to report the sighting of what I consider an unidentified flying object. 

The incident occurred at Crystal Beach, Texas, on August 12, 1957, between the hours of 10:00 and 10:30 p.m.

I was with members of my family, and a few close friends, at my brother's beach home. Everyone had retired for the night, and all had turned in except myself. 

As I changed position in bed, endeavoring to relax into a more comfortable position, I became aware of the object in full view.

From my position on the bed, I first observed the object, but it appeared to be very near. The object was motionless and silent on the first sighting, and that which was visible appeared to be a huge, orange-colored, disk-shaped affair suspended in mid-air. I was fascinated and lay quietly, observing.

Suddenly, the object began to move, going downward at an angle, and it seemed to be emitting a light, casting some illumination on the water below. As it moved downward, the object had changed position, because as it moved the light appeared to be coming from the side rather than the top or bottom.

As I lay there watching, after a lapse of time, the object returned, taking the same path, but this time moving upward. To be descriptive, it was as though I saw a crack open in the sky, and for some time the object seemed to hover, then would disappear as though the crack closed. I could easily see its movements and watch it with the naked eye.

My interest was aroused, and I wanted to be certain that it was not a vision, with no doubt as to the accuracy of my own sight and vision. I would do so, but I hardly dared my position, and lay there with the whole sky in full view, because the beach house is almost an enclosure of windows.

As I continued to watch, the object appeared again, coming from behind some high trees in the distance, and it seemed to hover, apparently at a great distance, for some time. Then it disappeared again, and I saw it no more.

The entire time I observed the object, it was silent, and the color remained the same, a brilliant orange. The size appeared to be larger than a small airplane, and I have the distinct impression that whatever it was, it was much higher in the sky than I first thought. When it disappeared, the sky seemed absolutely black, with no stars visible.

I realize this is a lengthy report, but I felt I should give you the details as I observed them. If any further information is desired, I shall be glad to supply it.

Very truly yours,
/s/ [Name]

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, likely an eyewitness report or account of a UFO sighting.

Suddenly from a great distance, a faint light began to grow an oscillating character would number it. It moved nearer it became more luminous, and seemed to be pulsating. A bright reddish-white light emerged, which had a triangular section in it's center. The object remained quiet and motionless and this is the way it remained.

There was a number of the family, who I knew were awake and witnessed the object. It seemed to be circular in shape and was visible to others. By the time the light seemed to diminish, but I watched it until it disappeared from sight.

The spectator went back to bed and I lay watching the expectation of seeing a witness to the object's return. But I saw nothing more, until gradually the huge orange light was in full view, with no sound, and continuing to diminish as if just before motion.

These are facts, just as they happened, related as accurately as I possibly could recall them.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

This replies to your recent letter concerning your observation of a flying object (UFO) on August 12.

We are unable to offer an explanation because of insufficient data. Insufficient information, such as detailed flight characteristics, weather information, and angular velocities are needed in my investigation of UFO sightings. Had you reported your observation to the nearest military installation at the time, an on-the-spot investigation could have been made.

Perhaps the enclosed Project Blue Book report will help identify what you have seen.

Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Sincerely,

ROBERT B. YOUNG
