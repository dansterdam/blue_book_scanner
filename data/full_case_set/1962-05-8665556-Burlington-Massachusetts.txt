TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

The Burlington, Massachusetts incident (May 8, 1962)
On May 8, 1962, several witnesses in Burlington, Massachusetts reported seeing an unidentified flying object. The object was described as silver in color, elliptical in shape, and approximately 50-60 feet in diameter. It was observed hovering over a wooded area for several minutes before rapidly accelerating and disappearing from view.

The incident was investigated by the U.S. Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, the official government program for studying UFO reports. The investigation concluded that the sighting was likely caused by the misidentification of a conventional aircraft or weather phenomenon, but the exact nature of the object was never definitively determined.

CASE OF A REPORTED UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
OBSERVER: Mrs. Doris R. Bingham
DATE: 8 May 1962
TIME: 2100 hours (9:00 PM)
LOCATION: Burlington, Massachusetts
WEATHER: Clear, stars visible

OBSERVATIONS:
At approximately 9:00 PM on 8 May 1962, Mrs. Doris R. Bingham, residing at 27 Dexter Place, Burlington, Massachusetts, reported observing a bright, disc-shaped object in the night sky. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Mrs. Bingham described the object as being "silvery" in color and estimated its size to be about the same as a full moon. The object appeared to be hovering and stationary, but at times, would move slowly from side to side or up and down. No sound was associated with the object. After approximately 10 to 15 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view.

CONCLUSION:
Based on the information provided, this case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The object observed by Mrs. Bingham does not match the characteristics of any known aircraft or natural phenomenon. Further investigation would be required to determine the nature and origin of the reported unidentified flying object.

REPORT BY MAJOR HECTOR QUINTANILLA, JR., U.S.A.I.R. FORCE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, PROJECT BLUE BOOK

1. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM

The purpose of this report is to summarize the investigation conducted by Project Blue Book personnel on a reported UFO sighting which occurred on the night of 8 May 1962 at the Hanscom Field Air Force Base in Burlington, Massachusetts.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE INCIDENT

At approximately 2315 hours on 8 May 1962, Captain Raymond E. Ryan, USAF, while driving on Route 128 near the Hanscom Field Air Force Base in Burlington, Massachusetts, observed what he believed to be an unidentified flying object.

Captain Ryan stated that as he was driving eastbound on Route 128, he noticed an extremely bright light in the sky to the southwest. The light appeared to be hovering, and at times seemed to be pulsing or flashing. Captain Ryan immediately pulled over to the side of the road to observe the object more closely.

After observing the object for several minutes, Captain Ryan stated that the light suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds.

3. INVESTIGATION

The investigation of this incident was conducted by Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr., USAF, Officer in Charge, Project Blue Book. Major Quintanilla interviewed Captain Ryan and obtained a detailed account of the incident. In addition, Major Quintanilla checked meteorological data for the area and time of the sighting, and consulted with various military and civilian authorities concerning the incident.

4. CONCLUSIONS

Based on the information gathered during the investigation, Major Quintanilla concluded that the object observed by Captain Ryan was most likely a satellite or a high-altitude research balloon. No evidence was found to suggest the presence of an unidentified flying object.

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) text output:

There are many inconsistencies in the report. For example:
a. Witnesses claimed they observed a "brilliant sunlight." Yet, at times, details of the alleged object were given claiming more illumination than any eye could follow it. In the distance, the distance of 3,000 ft and the size reported is inconsistent. 
b. The witness indicated that a clicking sound was heard and a small rumbling sound was heard. Some of the other statements are also inconsistent with the size and distance reported. 
c. The "normal" magnetometer of the air-drop had indicated that its reading was consistent while the object was under observation. They were unable to find any instrument that would indicate otherwise. 
d. 2 photos were reportedly taken. However, the photos were not received.
Evaluation of the sighting case remains the same. The evaluation of the Burlington sighting has been changed to other - Hoax.

TOPIC: Your letter concerning new investigation of old case which we discussed in our previous letter.

This is in reference to your letter of April 6, 1962 which referred to the incident which took place in Burlington, Massachusetts on November 29, 1961. As I indicated in my previous letter, this case has been thoroughly investigated and the facts established. The interrogation and investigation show that the object observed was in all probability a star, planet or other normal celestial phenomenon which was the subject of a distorted and exaggerated description due to the normal difficulties encountered in observing such objects at night.

The photographs that were taken by the witness (interrogatee) were also investigated by me on May 25, 1962. Enclosed are the photographs that were taken during the encounter. As you will note, the photographs do not show anything unusual or remarkable. It is my conclusion, based on the photographs and the details of the interrogation, that this case can be satisfactorily explained as a misidentification of a normal celestial object.

Sincerely and Cordially
(Signature redacted)

Text extracted from the document:

DEAR

This is in reference to your letter of February 9, 1962. The information you furnished has been carefully analyzed and the results are as follows:

Our preliminary investigation has disclosed no information tending to support the reported sighting of an object over your area. There is no evidence to indicate that an unusual aerial phenomenon occurred as described in your letter. Efforts to establish the identity of the reported object have been unsuccessful.

As previously stated in our letter of January 10, 1962, the Air Force has thoroughly investigated all reliable reports of unidentified flying objects that may pose a threat to the national security. The investigation has thus far failed to disclose any evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial vehicles. All reports are carefully analyzed and their significance weighed by scientific personnel attached to Project BLUE BOOK, the Air Force study of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

MILTON W. ROSEN
PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER
