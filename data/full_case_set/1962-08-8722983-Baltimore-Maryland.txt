Output of the text found in the document:

AUGUST 21, 1962
CASE 13, AUG. 21, and 22
A witness to the better observed sightings and all occurred at 11:10 PM and AG,
presumably the second pass of the same object. described as 23:23. The beginning
brightness was approximately 3 times as bright as Venus becoming 3/4 altitude 33° diminish
for all and 35° altitude and 33° azimuth for AG. The end points of both these
sightings were respectively for A1 30° altitude, 40° azimuth, and for A2 35°
altitude, 200° azimuth.
Of all these sightings all was the only one that was observed through
a telescope, a scintillator. Three lights were resolved. One bright white light,
a smaller and preceding light, along the vector, separately to see or are from
the other light. Another white light which maintained visibility while lights was
at flight angles, and to the south, of the flight direction and appeared to
go out or die.
There 5 sightings, which in such case occurred about 10 minutes before
each of the A sightings, have the following characteristics: E1 refers to the
first sighting of object B and 82 presumably to the second pass of B1. The time
of the B2 case was approximately 22:15 EDT.
The altitude and azimuth of the B sightings were respectively: B1
beginning, 60° altitude and azimuth largely indeterminate since object was
close to zenith. brightening altitude and azimuth of B2, 70° altitude, 50°
azimuth. The end points of the B1 and B2 projections were respectively for
B1, 45° altitude, 250° azimuth, and for B2 30° altitude and 270° azimuth.
The brightenings of event B sightings were commented upon as of a jellylike
easily visible to the naked eye and all was reported to be of a brightness inter-
mediate between that of Echo and of Jupiter. The sighting occurred 20 miles
southwest of Baltimore, MD.

RESUME OF THE SIGHTING
REPORT OF SIGHTINGS FOR THE A2 AND B2 SIGHTINGS, AND 9 MILES SOUTH OF THE FIRST LOCATION OF THE A2 AND B2 SIGHTINGS. OBJECT SEEMED TO BE STATIONARY AT 5 MILES. WHEN OBSERVER FIRST SAW THE OBJECT HE WAS ABOUT 5 MILES NORTH OF BALTIMORE AND THE SECOND PROMINENT PASSES OF BOTH A AND B OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED FROM HIS HOME, WHICH IS LOCATED ABOUT 9 MILES NORTH OF THE FIRST LOCATION.
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT OBJECT B TRAVELED IN A SENSE OPPOSITE TO THAT OF SATELLITE. IN GENERAL.
THE SIGHTING CONDITIONS: ALL WAS VERY GOOD.
THE TOTAL TRAJECTORY OF ALL OCCUPIED ABOUT 6-3/2 MINUTES AND COVERED AN AREA OF APPROXIMATELY 50°, GIVING A RATE OF 1/3° PER SECOND.
THE SIGHTINGS INDICATE THAT THE SIGHTINGS COINCIDE WITH NOTHING ON THEIR MAPS, UNLESS EYE OR TELESCOPE. THE TRAJECTORIES ARE OFF OF MAIN AIRWAYS PATTERNS AND FURTHER NO SOUND WAS HEARD EVEN THOUGH RELATIVELY CLOSE. POSSIBLY THIS WAS A RUSSIAN PROJECT AROUND WHEN IT WAS CHECKED.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch or diagram of an object. The sketch appears to be a triangular or delta-shaped object with an arrow pointing to it, indicating the direction of movement.

The text in the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - Yes
b. Color - Brilliant white
17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, projections, etc., and specifically whether trails or vapor trails were seen. Also indicate the direction the object was moving.
[Sketch of a triangular or delta-shaped object with an arrow pointing to it]

a. Circle (One) - Fuzzy or blurred
b. Square 
c. Sharply outlined
d. Don't remember
19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
Eccentric white light - 2 or 3 milliradian.

There does not appear to be any photograph present on this page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. The page contains only text, which I will now transcribe:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. How large did the object appear to you as compared to an object with which you are familiar?

22. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?

23. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object you saw.

The image contains three sketches related to UFO sightings. The first sketch shows a curved trajectory of an object, with the instructions to draw a "B" on the curved line to indicate the position of the object when it was first seen. The second and third sketches show larger views of the objects, with the instructions to use the smaller sketches as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

Here is the text I was able to extract from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that the object you drew in the first sketch (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "B" on the same curved line to show the position where you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place a "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
