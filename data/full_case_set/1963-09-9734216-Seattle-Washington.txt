Optical character recognition (OCR) of the text found in the document:

I sighted out the object again and attempted to see it a little closer. Back in almost the same location as before. The object apparently appeared to float on their own on them. They were 3 feet away from each other. They disappeared shortly after, just the same way as before.

On these occasions my hand and watch frequently stopped or fluctuate a little uncertain. Ground a swayno (Ground radar, no change). This seems to be leaving a deep impression on the people concerned. Pacing Emergency Report. Wind velocity from West, velocity 5 to 10 mph, elevation approximately 30,000 feet, duration 3 to 4 at 9:00 p.m.

Respectfully,

The text appears to be discussing details about a specific incident, including the time and location, as well as some observations or witness accounts. However, there are no visual elements such as photographs or illustrations included in this particular page.

Transcribing the text from the image:

NOTE: The photos working directly behind the light was seen about the same time that the light was first visible. The first object came first and was followed by the second. Apparently they were working in the sighting, apparently some effort to check the findings. However, it is unfortunate that photographs were not obtained.

Dear Mr. Washington,

This is in reply to your letter dated September 17th. On September 17th you reported a sighting on September 17th.

Of the two sightings you observed, the first was probably an aircraft, possibly your attention was drawn to it due to the unusual circumstances under which you observed it, i.e., it seemed to be maneuvering in a seemingly erratic manner. The second sighting, as you describe it, was possibly a slow moving object traveling in a southeasterly direction at a low altitude on the evening of September 17th.

Sincerely,

Maston M. Jacks
Public Information Div.
Office of Information
