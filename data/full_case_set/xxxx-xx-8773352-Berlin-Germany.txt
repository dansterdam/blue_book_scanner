The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch and a diagram. The sketch depicts the motion of an object, with an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end. The diagram shows a horizon with an "overhead" view and provides instructions for drawing the motion of the object.

Text from the document:

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.

I believe the forming of such objects is actually the result of being dancers. I believe the actual dancing dancers could be far more dangerous, and that it is only because they are not going more directly that it would mean destruction to the entire craft and everything else. The effects caused that they are fighting into the air would apparently be very developed and could mean destruction to the entire craft and everything else. The effects caused that they are fighting into the air would apparently be very developed and could mean destruction to the entire framework of the craft. It seems to have appeared to have some and other feeling effects caused me of having stepped into what there was much I can't say about the phenomena. 

I also believe the government increasing numerous as our population increases unless it found to prevent same.

Also may be having "flying saucer" worries but Russian possibly some combat tests when stepped backward out of enlarged more rapidly and as it became more and more dismantled I could recognize. 

I also believe the contents of this affect could be so rlight together and cannot answer as stand out firmly, as those air craft or in what condition immediately and then soon, even continuing to air craft flying into the contained directly. It could be interesting, keeping the contents to cause greater destruction.

I believe these effects start to fear more mean the earth and all things from moving form from being some of them to almost what they actually these are harm or right to that some.

Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Dear Sirs,

About a month ago I filed in my answers to questions you mailed to me regarding my contact with an aerial phenomenon and immediately mailed them back to you, and still I have not heard from you. I have only just now received the enclosed letter from Congressman Vorys Morris which letter he had received from Department of the Air Forces, Washington and I have not received a letter from them. I am just wondering how long it is my take them to get to and examine my report.

I wish to inform you that I am corresponding for offers for the information regarding my contact with the aerial phenomenon, and most of all what is contained judging by the two senses, toric and small, the only means of course, by which I could or could, to determine the aerial phenomenon's contents to my satisfaction and I will accept the largest offers for same that will be given me with the near future providing the largest.

Here is the text output from the OCR:

"There is so much an amount that I, Swill, want to accept it, and if it is not, Swill not even disclose the aerial phenomena contained. I believe I should be offered the cost price of one of the U.S. air force's largest bombers but I would accept an offer for less.

While you let me hear from you as soon as possible.

Sincerely yours"

He or they remained stationary for about five (5) minutes, then they went out of sight about five (5) minutes later. Their movements in flight seemed to be that they remained in sight for one (1) or two (2) minutes, then they disappeared from sight.

Formation and Direction of Flight:

First formation flying east. 
Second formation flying west at a much higher altitude and continued flying westward and disappeared.

They were white in color and in a way they looked like the moon. They disappeared just blending into the dark sky. They were the objects fly over the buildings SW of the base. They were about ten (10) or fifteen (15) miles away. Altitude undetermined, speed unknown, no sound heard.

After objects appeared the second time I called tower; time was approximately 2320 local. After tower operator saw them he said they would make a report on it.

1. Interviewed 1st Lt KERLEY, 14648th AACS Squadron, who interviewed a source on 11 August 1952 relative to radar indications of an object at 2300, 11 August 1952. Source stated that he had been flying officer at GCS (Radar) compiling Air Base at Tempelhof airfield on 11 August 1952 and that while there, he observed that any indications might not have been seen because objects might have been ground cover. No other personnel were questioned and no physical evidence was obtained.

2. Review of the film kept by the Technical Information Unit at District #3 OSI indicates that the film shows four sightings (1/3) covering a period of approximately 2 minutes and 35 seconds with a maximum speed of approximately 3000 to 5000 mph. The direction of travel was from West to East. The film shows the contrast of the object against the sky and the turning maneuvers which it accomplished. Pressure of 29.45 inches.
