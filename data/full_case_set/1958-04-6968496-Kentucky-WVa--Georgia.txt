APRIL 20, 1958
SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT NEAR ATLANTA, GA. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WAS FURNISHED BY  NAVY PILOT, REPORTED AS A MAJ OR, FROM ATLANTA, GA.
ON OR ABOUT 18 APRIL 1958, WHILE FLYING IN THE NORTH GEORGIA AREA OF THE ATLANTA AREA, THIS NAVAL OFFICER SIGHTED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS ROUND, WITH A VERY BRIGHT, BULLET SHAPED, FIERY RED TAIL. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE OF A YELLOW HAZE OR COLOR, LARGER THAN A STAR, BUT SMALLER THAN A FULL MOON. IT WAS TRAVELING IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. HIS REACTION TO THE SIGHTING WAS ONE OF AMAZEMENT, AS HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE. ACCORDING TO HIS REPORT, THE OBJECT PASSED ALMOST DIRECTLY OVERHEAD, HEADING SLIGHTLY EASTERLY AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT IN APPROXIMATELY 3 TO 4 SECONDS.
THE SIGHTING TOOK PLACE AT ROUGHLY BETWEEN 23:15 AND 23:20, EASTERN STANDARD TIME. THE NAVY PILOT STATED THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A METEOR, AS ITS FLIGHT PATH AND DURATION WAS MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THAT USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH CELESTIAL EVENTS. HE FURTHER STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL AND GUIDANCE.
THIS SIGHTING WAS REPORTED TO THE 20TH FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR SQUADRON, DOBBINS AIR FORCE BASE, MARIETTA, GA. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED TO THE CONTROL TOWER AT ATLANTA MUNICIPAL AIRPORT.
REPORTER FOR THE MARIETTA (GA.) JOURNAL SAID THAT HIS PAPER RECEIVED A REPORT FROM ANOTHER OBSERVER WHO ALSO SAW THE OBJECT, AND WHO CORROBORATED THE NAVY PILOT'S DESCRIPTION. CONSTITUTION AND THE ATLANTA JOURNAL AND CONSTITUTION STATIONS CARRIED BRIEF MENTION OF THIS SIGHTING ON THEIR RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE ATLANTA AREA.
