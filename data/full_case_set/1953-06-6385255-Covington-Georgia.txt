DATE - TIME GROUP: 12/09/2002
LOCATION: Covington, Georgia
SOURCE: Carl H. Allen
NUMBER OF OBJECTS: One
LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 30 minutes
TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-visual
COURSE: Not reported
PHOTOS: None
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None
CONCLUSION: INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR AN EVALUATION

BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS: All of the data reported appears consistent with the observations of an unknown aerial object. However, the lack of sufficient details and physical evidence prevents a definite evaluation. The object was described as maneuverable, but no other details are provided. Additional information would be needed to reach a more conclusive determination.

The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page contains a questionnaire with instructions and questions related to the observed motion and size of an unidentified object.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? If how large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a "man-made" object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

25 June 1953

1st Lt. Robert Olsson
ATIC -- Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson:

Of the last batch of 14 items sent on June 15, the only one about which there is anything additional to her mentioned in my previous letter is the one with the duration of sighting. A few details on this:

Regarding the Detroit 11 June case is there anything in this that a good landing didn't occur and no signals? In the Ontario Canada AFB 1 June case there are probable explanations of faulty radar. I assume that the OCR had radar available.

And we still have Venus with us. The 9 June Oregon case is clearly and unequivocally Venus.

Jennie has called to my attention the fact that I asked some follow-up questions which by now you may have obtained the answers.

Anything new on:
5 March Shaw AFB
3 April Lake AFB
27 April Fort Austin
12 April Stead AFB

I am anxiously awaiting Jennie's clearance so we can get organized in a more business-like manner. I know you can't do anything about this but I'm mentioning it anyway. I hope it eases through before your successor is appointed.

Cordially,
Allen Hynek

1 0 DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT: AIRCRAFT COO 670 DEPARTED DOBBINS AFB, GA. ON ROUITINE DAY TRAINING MISSION. PILOT (1ST LT. COOK) REPORTED VISUAL CONTACT WITH PECULIAR OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE APPROACHING THE AIRCRAFT. THE PILOT STATED HE DID NOT ACTUALLY SEE THE OBJECT, BUT IT WAS DETECTED ON HIS SEARCH RADAR. SOME DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT WERE REFERRED TO WRIGHT FIELD FOR TECHNICALANALYSIS BV THE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE SECTION CONNECTED WITH PROJECT BLUE BOOK.
The pilot stated that the object appeared to be approaching the aircraft and circling it. The aircraft was approximately 20 miles southeast of the Dobbins AFB area at an altitude of 15,000 feet. No other aircraft were visible in the area at the time. The pilot stated the object could have been seen from a great distance except for the extremely high speed and maneuverability of the object. To the best of the pilot's knowledge, the object had no external lighting or markings of any kind. The pilot did not fire at the object because he did not wish to antagonize it and because he was operating under the Atlanta filter center.

A weather balloon released either from Atlanta Regional Airport or other locations in Georgia contained godown at an altitude of 20,000 feet and double the normal size, and the wind was prevailing from the north but according to the pilot, this was not the object observed.
