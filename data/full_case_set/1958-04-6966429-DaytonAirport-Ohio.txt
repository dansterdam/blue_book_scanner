The image provided does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. I will now proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text and provide the output:

6. Observer states that a "car" was observed (station at 2:21) and that it seemed to be a cloud.
7. Observed a "mass" some 20 feet in diameter. This appeared to be some object with a "mist" or "cloud" surrounding it.
8. Appeared to be traveling approx. 50 "miles" per hour and very low - only a "few feet" from the ground. No noise and no exhaust were observed.
Middletown identity of some unidentified object (perhaps a cloud, or a weather or other natural phenomenon) as seen at The Dayton Airport near Ohio on April 6, 1958.

Incident on Dec. Capt.

The following is the report by Major Edgar Newton Lundeen.
1. Check with Radar while some men 2-3 km. a long stony steady, nothing identical (only one track visible)
