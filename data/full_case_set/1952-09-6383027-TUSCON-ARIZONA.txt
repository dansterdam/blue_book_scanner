Transcription of the text in the document:

In compliance with AF Letter 200-5, dated 29 April, 1952, the following information is submitted:

(1) This single, orange-colored object, when viewed from a distance, appeared to be about the size of a basketball, with the appearance of a fluorescent light or a welding arc. It was reported to be accompanied by a blue fluorescent glow, which appeared to be beam shaped. Its explosive-like brilliance, and some red or orange flame, seemed to be seen exhaled. Its color, as observed, appeared to be a vivid orange, or reddish-orange, and it was observed to be surrounded by a light blue or greenish-blue luminous area.

(2) This object or flash was observed at 1030 hours CST, and remained visible for from three to twenty seconds. The disappearance of the object seemed to be the dwindling of the light, rather than a sudden extinguishing.

(3) A visual surface observation without optical or electronic equipment was made.

(4) The object was observed from two different locations, and while the shape appeared to be round or spherical, at the first observation it seemed to be narrower than at the second observation, the angle of the object to the ground visually, that is, the altitude of the object, seemed to be lower. The first observer spotted the object at an attitude of 300. The second observer spotted the object at an altitude of 20,000 and 15 miles distant.

(5) This object was observed by the observer and his wife, and the other observer and his wife.

(6) As to the time of the sighting, the weather was warm. There were scattered clouds, and almost no wind.

(7) No activity or condition, meteorological or otherwise, is known to have existed which may have accounted for the sighting.

(8) No physical evidence of the sighting exists.

(9) No interception or identification action taken.

(10) Location of air activity in the general area at the time of the sighting is unknown.

STATEMENT

At approximately 2230 hours, CST, 7 September 1952, my wife and I were visiting friends at Billy Mitchell Village. We were just leaving the premises when we noticed an unusual phenomenon in the sky. A dark opaque object, circular in shape, was observed and remained visible for approximately three seconds as it went out. This object appeared to be approximately fifteen miles distant at approximately twenty thousand feet altitude and appeared to be the size of a new halftone range.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Transcription of the text:

As to 23:30 on the night of September seventh, 1952, my wife and I were sitting outside our house at _____, when suddenly we saw a cherry orange colored object appear in the Northwest sky. This object or light, flashed on in much the same way as a flashy, and seemed to be about the size of a small automobile. The object was at an angle of 22 degrees from the ground, and by estimating its distance as a triangle, I figured the object to be at an altitude of 5000'. The object remained motionless, and in fifteen or twenty seconds it suddenly disappeared. Its particular color would be equivalent to a flame temperature of approximately 3300 degrees Fahrenheit. The object was then shaped about twice as long as it was wide, and did not change in size, color, or brilliance. I understand it did not throw any shadows, or make any noise.
and there was no sound to the loss of my knowledge this object could not possibly be explained by the presence of any conventional aircraft, but it comes to me that it could possibly be due to the formation of city lights.
I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
