ASTRONOMY
SCIENCE NEWS LETTER FOR MARCH 25, 1961

Lion Shines High in South
Leo, the lion, roams the southern sky in April. Gemini, 
the twins (with Orion hunting) wil set toward mornings 
and Canis Minor, in the west, James Stokley reports.

A brighter in the south on April 1. Little Dipper" and Cassiopeia areseentothe north. 
Venus is the con-spicuous object in the western evening sky. 
Mars appears low in the northeast and Jupiter in the south.

As April progresses, Leo, the lion, will move across the sky ahead of the sun. By the time the lion reaches the western horizon, it will be near the time of sunset. Jupiter is also a con-spicuous object in the southern sky and will be seen most of the night.

Venus and Mercury (which is not visible at all in the south-ern evening sky) reach their greatest brilliance about mid-April. The disk of Venus is about 60 per cent full. We get a good view of it at this time as the planet is then at its nearest to the earth and summer-brightest.

Mars is Only Evening Planet
Mars is now seen in the west and will be visible in the evening sky through April. This planet is much fainter than Venus and cannot be observed as readily after sunset.

The only other planet visible is Jupiter, which can be seen in the south after dark. This giant of the solar system reached opposition last December, when it came within 413,000,000 miles of the earth. It has been growing larger and brighter in our skies, and now shines as a brilliant star low in the south at evening.

The twin stars of the constellation Gemini, Castor and Pollux, set before midnight, and the famous "Dog Star," Sirius in Canis Major, also sets in the west before the end of the night.

This is the season when the celestial spectacle of Orion the Hunter is seen best in the south after dark. He is retiring to the southwest and will soon be lost from view. The constellation Ursa Major, the Big Dipper, is high in the northeast at nightfall, while the Little Dipper and Cassiopeia are seen to the north.

MEDICINE

Deaths From Abortion
Remain High in Britain

LONDON, ENGLAND - Abortions continue
to rank third highest on the list of causes of
death among women in England and Wales.
Only heart disease and cancer cause more
deaths among women, Doctors still are credited
with saving many lives, but deaths from
criminal and self-induced abortions remain
high. In 1957, deaths of women who had
undergone abortions, legal or illegal, were
115 deaths per one million live births. At Walton
Women's Hospital, Liverpool, England, 100
women were admitted last year for treatment after
abortions performed outside the hospital, some of
which could have been prevented if proper
medical attention had been given.
The Medical Research Council's Committee on
the health of women in relation to the practice of
abortion has just published its report. Dr. Percy
Stocks said he has now stopped advising
doctors concerned with abortion policy.

Underground Nuclear
Test Study Planned

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Atomic Energy
Commission is considering conducting an
experiment to test the effects of an underground
nuclear explosion on the water table, in determining
the feasibility of underground nuclear test
ban verification.
The tests, which have been highly publicized by
ABC, would be designed to determine the
possibility of detecting underground nuclear
explosions from the tremors they produce.
AEC has stated that while such test would be
helpful in underground test ban verification, dangers
of radioactive contamination are involved and the
experiment is still only under consideration. A final
decision has not been made.

MATHEMATICS

Elementary Math
Training Urged

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Mathematical training
must be upgraded to keep ahead of the demands
of the modern technology, according to Dr. H. (J.
Poliak of Bell Telephone Laboratories, speaking at
a meeting of the American Mathematical Society and
the Mathematical Association of America.
Dr. Poliak said some changes must be made in the
elementary math courses to give students a better
grasp of fundamental mathematical concepts. He
emphasized the need for more emphasis on basic
training in arithmetic, measurement, and
intuitive geometry, rather than on advanced and
specialized topics. The changes should be based
on the increasing need for a "qualitative" rather than
a "quantitative" mathematical background among
scientists and engineers.

Extensive Study of
Extreme Causes Tornadoes

THE U.S. Weather Bureau will in the
near future, conduct more intensive studies of
tornadoes and other sever local storms in an
attempt to determine the factors necessary for their
development. The study will analyze the
atmosphere before, during and after tornado
development, to establish relationships between the
synoptic-scale weather patterns and the local
conditions that may produce tornadoes.
The National Severe Storms Project at
Norman, Okla., will play a key role in the proposed
studies. The factors causing tornadoes are not well
understood and the ability to predict them is still
poor. Similar studies have been made of hurricanes,
but tornadoes are much harder to track and
study. Plans call for mobile radar and observation
teams to study the structure of tornadoes and the
atmosphere around them. March 22, 1961.

It was reported by Mr. Fhilipg 
(from the factory Of MONDI) thet On Tuesday at about 8 p.m. when going home 
from work he saw a strange luminous object in the sky. He said that it was
very bright and changed its course several times while he was watching it.
He called his friend Henry Logue 
to come and look at it. They watched it for about ten minutes when it
suddenly disappeared.

The text content of the document is as follows:

Air Intelligence Office (ATIC-IX-3)
Unidentified Flying Objects
8 May 1961

Mr. [redacted]
North Plainfield, New Jersey

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your letter of 1 May 1961, regarding your sighting of a "flying object" on 30 April 1961, has been given to this office for appropriate action.

The information concerning the results of UFO investigations we have gathered over the years indicates that some of these reports do have a factual basis, and we have responsibility now to investigate them further. We hope you will soon receive helpful information directly from this investigation.

As for your report on your observation of 30 April, and your request for additional information, this letter presents the initial evaluation of the information you have provided. From an initial study, the object you saw appears to be a reliable classification of all aerial phenomena requiring careful scientific analysis. The object is said to have been observed by several persons and to have exhibited some unusual characteristics, such as unusual speed as well as optical instruments and other scientific equipment. Your attention is directed to the caution expressed in our letter as to the danger involved in attempting to approach or identify such objects, as the methods necessary for a reliable classification of the object that you saw could be hazardous.

However, we appreciate your cooperation in reporting your observations, and we can assure you that all reports of this kind, indicating the appearance of unidentified flying objects, are carefully considered. No suggestion as to the identification of the object you observed can be made at this time, as the investigation is considered to be warranted. Any further suggestion or information will be promptly supplied to you. This report, with the details obtained at that installation, will then be forwarded to the nearest Air Force installation.

Sincerely,

LES H. STRAHL
Deputy Chief
Air Intelligence Office

April 23, WATCHUNG, NEW JERSEY WITNESS: Miss Margaret Kelly, 23 year old secretary residing at 59 Wilson Avenue, Watchung, New Jersey, reported sighting a luminous object in the sky at approximately 11:00 PM on the night of April 23, 1961.

According to the witness, the object was first observed in the southwest sky, moving rapidly across the sky in a horizontal position. The object, which appeared to be round in shape and gave off a brilliant white light, was visible for a period of approximately 30 seconds before disappearing from view. Miss Kelly stated she was unable to determine the exact size or altitude of the object but that it appeared to be a considerable distance from her location.
