The image provided appears to be a poorly scanned, low-resolution photocopy of a document page with a lot of noise and artifacts. There is visible text which is quite blurry and there are no clear photographs visible within this image. 

Attempting to function as an OCR system, I'll provide the text as best as I can decipher from the image:

Several areas are illegible, and therefore, the text includes placeholders "(ILLEGIBLE)" or underscores where I can't confidently determine the content.
