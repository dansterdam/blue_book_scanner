Field survey was made of an unusual effect on a 3x3 yard area in lawn. Area was perfectly circular, approximately 3-1/2 feet in diameter. The ground was slightly depressed and the grass blades were bent at a 45 degree angle to the ground but not damaged or broken. The grass blades were dry and limp, and the ground was dry and dusty within the circle. The outside area of the circle looked normal. The area had the appearance of being pressed downward, as if some heavy object had been placed on the ground for a period of time, then removed.
