K. Position, title and comments of the preparing officer: "The planet venus was visisble during the period of sighting. Its brightness and Green lights could be a result of refraction of the light through the atmosphere. The slight up and down movement could be caused by atmospheric effect that is caused by staring at a light with few reference points available."
