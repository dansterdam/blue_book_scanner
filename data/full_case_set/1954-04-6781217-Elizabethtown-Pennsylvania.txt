The text of the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

OBJECT: LIGHT GRAY, CIRCULAR OBJECT ABOUT 25 FEET IN DIAMETER WITH FLAT BOTTOM AND DOME-SHAPED TOP, ESTIMATED 10,000 FEET OVER ELIZABETHTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA, ON APRIL 6, 1954.

DESCRIPTION: The object was observed from the ground by one witness, a part-time USAF Reserve pilot. The witness stated that the object was flat on the bottom and dome-shaped on top, light gray in color, and approximately 25 feet in diameter. It was observed for about 4 to 5 minutes at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet.

The object was motionless and silent, and there was no trail or exhaust visible. The witness could not identify the object as any known aircraft. No other witnesses were located.

CONCLUSIONS: The object remains unidentified. Due to the lack of additional witnesses and detailed data, no conclusive analysis can be made.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting (Short Title: UFOB)
Date of Sighting: 6 April 1954
Location: Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania
Time: 7:00 PM
Weather Conditions: Clear, visibility 15 miles
Civilian Observer
SUMMARY: (Deleted Name), Civilian Observer, reported sighting an unidentified flying object on 6 April 1954, at approximately 7:00 PM, near Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania. The object was described as being white in color, shaped like an egg, and leaving a white vapor trail. It traveled in an erratic flight path and was observed for approximately 15-20 minutes. The object apparently accelerated rapidly and disappeared from view.
This incident is being investigated by this office. A more detailed or supplemental report will be submitted if additional pertinent information is obtained.

The image does not contain any photographs, only text. I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

1. I am the captain in charge of Box and Lumber Reclamation in the Repair Section of the Quartermaster Depot at Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania. On Sunday evening, 7 March 1954, a civilian-type aircraft crashed within the limits of the Repair Section.

2. On Sunday evening, 7 March 1954, at approximately 7:45 p.m. and a friend of mine, [redacted], were sitting in a staff car in the north parking lot of the depot. We observed an object in the sky in an easterly direction and at an elevation of approximately 30 to 40 degrees.

3. I looked into the sky in an easterly direction and saw a bright object with an orange-reddish glow. This object appeared to be traveling in a northerly direction. It was quite high and moving at a very rapid speed.

4. I would judge that this object was approximately a mile and a half away from our position and at a very high altitude. It was traveling at a speed which I would estimate to be in excess of 1000 miles per hour. To my best knowledge, it could not have been any conventional type aircraft.

5. This object appeared to me to be circular in shape and at times seemed to be oscillating or rotating on its axis. It appeared to be giving off a great deal of light and seemed to be surrounded by a halo of light.

6. As well as I can remember, I had this object in sight for a period of approximately 2 to 3 minutes. It did not descend or change its course during this time. It merely continued on in a northerly direction until it disappeared from sight.

7. My wife and I observe almost daily many aircraft in the air over the depot. I am thoroughly familiar with the appearance of conventional aircraft, both in the day and night. This object was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen before.

8. It appears to be a matter of only a few seconds, after we first observed the object, that it suddenly disappeared from sight, apparently at a terrific speed. There were no lights to be seen, nor any sound heard, as it went out of sight.

TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

Statement is as follows: 
On the above date while I was searching the sky I saw a light which I recognized as an extraordinary object. After a few minutes passed it disappeared towards the east across my field of view. 
Shortly after a few minutes passed I returned to my home and called Olmsted Air Force Base. The telephone operator at Olmsted informed my call to Hight.

Sir, I am an individual who made the call in flight operations as notified in reference to the extraordinary object seen by me in flight. The object was circular in shape and highly illuminated. It appeared to be about twice the size of a medium bomber airplane at an elevation of about 30 degrees. The object was observed for about 2 to 3 minutes and then disappeared in a high speed to the east across my field of view.

The object appeared to have no exhaust or trail of any kind as it moved across the sky. It appeared to be self illuminated and did not blink or change color. The speed at which it disappeared was greatly in excess of anything I have ever seen in the sky before.

The above is a factual statement to the best of my knowledge and belief.

30 April 1954

This statement is provided to assist an official investigation that has been instituted as a result of the reported sighting.

Ralph J. Mayher, Jr.
