SUMMARY
State your own personal evaluation of the report. What do you think the object was? Do you think something other than the sighting may have led to the caller's evaluation of the object?

(Handwritten text)
I believe this to be a legitimate report - very well described and evaluated by the observer. The object fits the description of the "typical" UFO, ie: a fairly large, metallic, disc-shaped object with lights. The observer's evaluation seems unbiased and completely reasonable. Although no photographs were taken, the detailed observation and description provided lend credibility to the report.

SUBJECT: Physical Specimen, 13 July 49

TO: Dr J. Allen Hynek
Reference the attached specimen that was sent to this office under date of 13 July 1949. This sample was obtained with the cooperation of the Greenland base that reported one of the so-called "flying saucers" to have been seen.

The sample has been studied by the Northwestern University and they report to us that it appears to be a piece of cellulose material, no different from ordinary cigarette paper. They are unable to find any unusual characteristics in it so that we can send it back to the owner.

The sample sent to you as an unidentified flying object is a pumice-like glass. It has an irregular, rough surface and appears to have some cavities. There are a few crystals visible in the cavities.

The sample closely resembles a manufactured product that has been marketed as "sanding blocks" for precision woodworking. It also has the same physical characteristics as the sanding blocks. I do not have any of the commercial material at hand for comparison, but it seems probable that your sample is a fragment of the same material.

W Father Jaliicm 
causes UFO Heports
LONDON, O. — The Rev. John F. Jailison, a Roman Catholic priest in London, 0., has said that he believes many UFO sightings and reports are the result of natural phenomena and are not necessarily "something from outer space."
The priest, who has studied the UFO phenomenon for some time, said that he has found that many sightings can be explained by clouds, meteors, re-entry of spacecraft, and other natural events. He indicated that his studies have led him to the conclusion that only a small number of reported UFO sightings probably have an "extraterrestrial" explanation.
The priest stated that he has found many instances where people have reported seeing unusual objects in the sky which turn out to be natural phenomena that people are not familiar with. He said that some people tend to get overly excited and report these natural events as UFOs.
Father Jaliison said that he has found that many reported UFO sightings occur at night when it is more difficult to identify objects in the sky, and that some sightings may be the result of hoaxes or imagination. He indicated that his studies have led him to believe that great caution should be used in evaluating reported UFO sightings.

"Air Fetterman Lment Unidentified Object Mystery

U.S.A. - This report came to us through an eyewitness, Mr. Fetterman of Lament, . We have received many reports from persons in all walks of life who have had close encounters with UFOs. Many area residents were astonished when this strange looking object made several close passes over their homes, sometimes in daylight, sometimes at night. Although no physical traces or material evidence could be obtained, many witnesses, including some professional people, have reported seeing this object hovering low or rushing swiftly past. The description of the object corresponds in many details to those received from other parts of the country. This object was reported to be low, round shaped, give off a pulsating light, and appeared to be half as big as the full moon. At no time was there any noise from the object. Just how many have seen this object is not known, but it is believed that many who saw it did not report it. I shall not attempt to put into words the strange, unknown quality of this experience, as it is simply beyond my power to describe. One wonders just how many such objects are reportedly circling the United States, but are simply not reported. Perhaps all be assumed that there is much more going on than we know."

Gentlemen:

Last July 30, at about 10:00 p.m. EDT, my wife and I observed a luminous object which I believe to have been a UFO. It was hovering silently just above the treetops some distance away, and then suddenly it shot off rapidly at an unbelievable speed and that with a PA flashing down the middle. 

Becoming I authorize a Universes on occasions I am requested to recognize interested UFO sightings, and that if you might be able to send these illustrations to me, I would be determined in a position to assist in a determination OF the Y-shaped trace.

Thank you.

The image appears to contain a technical drawing or diagram of a dart target, labeled "Dart Target, Type K-12". The drawing includes dimensions and other specifications for the dart target. There is no photograph present in this image.

Text extracted from the document:

DART TARGET, TYPE K-12
SIZE: 6" x 32"
WEIGHT: 8 lbs., 4 oz.

The K-12 dart target is 8 feet wide at the rear and 6 feet long. Its wings are constructed of plywood which is slanted to an eight-inch thickness in the rear. The target is mounted in the rear of the target, with a 1/4-inch aluminum sheet for strength.

DART TARGET, TYPE K-12
Size: 6" x 32"
Weight: 10 lbs., 12 oz.

The K-12 dart target is similar to the K-11, except that it is 5 feet long and 8 feet wide. When properly set up, it employs the same procedures as for the K-11. It also requires the same hardware, maintenance, and repairing as the K-11.

Operational use of the type K-12 is the same as the K-11 dart target, except that the dimensions differ. It also employs an X-band corner reflector feature at the rear of the target.

Balloon Drops In On Ohio 
PORTSMOUTH, O. (AP)—George L. Gus tin, pilot of a plastic balloon, dropped in on Portsmouth from France Saturday.
The Dayton Journal Herald here carried a story and photograph of the unexpected visitor.
Gustin said the big balloon was launched from Villacoublay, near Paris, on July 19 on a voyage to the United States. It had been aloft more than 57 hours.
Gustin said the landing in Ohio was intentional, that he was aiming for the Ohio River near Portsmouth. The landing caused considerable excitement in the area as the descending balloon was first mistaken for a parachutist falling to earth.
Gustin explained to newsmen that the flight of the balloon had been smooth except for some buffeting by winds. He said the balloon would be retrieved and returned to France.

DALTON DAILY NEWS 21 JULY
Latins Seeing Saucers,
And Not in Their Cups
BUENOS AIRES, July 20 (UPI) -Reports of flying saucer sightings over parts of Latin America are increasing, but officials say the sightings are not caused by too much strong drink.
Capt. Mario Arce, chief of Argentina's Civil Aeronautics Department, said his office has received many reports of unidentified objects in the sky, particularly over the northwestern provinces.
"I am convinced that these sightings are real," he said. "The people who report them are sober, respectable citizens."
Similar reports have come from Peru, Chile and other countries. Aviation officials say the sightings are being taken seriously and are being investigated.
The navy has been alerted to watch for the strange objects. Officials say they are being seen both at night and during the day, sometimes hovering, sometimes zooming away at high speed.

Mr. Robert Citron

Astrophysical Observatory
Cambridge, Mass.

Dear Mr. Citron:

I am enclosing a copy of a report of the sighting of an unidentified flying object that I observed during this past summer. This was reported to Sky & Telescope. They replied later saying that they had no interest in this idea what the object might have been.

As that time I was unaware of your interest in this kind of thing as indicated in the New York Times article on December 16. I plan to get the article in Scientific American of November 1968 entitled "Article called in Soyance: Claiming on flying saucers' lest I thought the description would be interesting to you - the angular size, speeds, distances, and of course I believe this is a possible explanation for what I observed.

Incidentally the friend with whom I was observing that night sa wout of the corner of his eyes, as we were discussing this object, something moving at a much greater speed than it. This he did not see with me then. 

Sincerely yours

This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, which was the United States Air Force's systematic study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

REPORT OF SIGHTING OF STRANGE MOVING OBJECT ON 29 JULY 19_  
TIME: Sighted at approximately 2:50 PM CDT - 2 minutes  
LOCATION OF OBSERVER: Laredo, Texas, 270 30' N., 990 30' W.  
SKY CONDITION: Clear  
SEEING CONDITION: To the south, limiting magnitude about 4 to 4.5. To the north, somewhat hazy, limiting magnitude about 3 to 3.5.  
DESCRIPTION: The object was about 1 hour after passing the zenith, moving in a straight line from the west to east, with a speed that would have covered the full visible sky in about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. It was about the apparent size of a dime held at arm's length. It seemed quite bright, much brighter than any star or planet, and left no trail. It was seen on these occasions and showed no change in appearance except that on one occasion it seemed slightly elongated. As it passed to the east, it gradually faded from view. This was an unusual object, a description of which follows:  

APPEARANCE: It appeared to be a seamless egg-shaped or elliptical form, with a smooth, uniform surface and no visible markings or projections. In color, it was much the same as the light seen in a small incandescent lamp. It seemed to emit an internal glow rather than reflect light from the sun.  

MOTION: It was in motion when I first sighted it, at the point where it was at its highest altitude. Its speed was steady and the motion was even and smooth, without any wavering or irregular flight path. I lost sight of it as it faded in the distance to the east.  

FURTHER NOTES ON GENERAL APPEARANCE: To the naked eye, it had the appearance of a star-like object, but with a slightly larger visual magnitude than that of the brightest stars. When my gaze was fixed on it, it appeared to have a slightly elongated shape. When my gaze was diverted, it seemed to return to a more circular appearance. No sound was heard. No vapor trail or exhaust was visible, and there was no evidence of any propulsive mechanism. The object appeared to be self-luminous, giving the impression of a miniature sun or nuclear device.

The image does not appear to contain any photograph. It is a typed document with text describing an unidentified object that was observed. I will now proceed to transcribe the text from the document:

If you will imagine a photograph of a nearly spherical, luminous object that the sky, you will see about 10 feet in diameter, hovering over a pine grove about half a mile away. It would appear to be about 200 feet above the ground and you will be pretty close to the actual objects and your interpretation.  

SPECULATION: The object that I saw maneuvered in a peculiar way. From the time the object was first observed, it maintained a steady hovering position, but about 30 seconds later it moved rapidly toward the observer at an extremely low altitude, estimated to be approximately 200 feet above the ground. It then hovered again for about 1 minute and then suddenly shot upward at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight.  This was a very amazing and very possibly much closer than this.

SPECULATION: Therefore I would eliminate all of these (and I have not come upon them) except one, and that is the unpredicted that I had never observed nor, to my best knowledge, observed by others before. Before going into this, I should say that I have observed many aircraft, artificial satellites, birds, and other objects and know quite well how they behave. But this was definitely much different - no wings, no sound, just silently hovering and then darting at an unbelievable speed.

Because of my skepticism, I have left this for some time. But that of UAPO, which I've read about, is now troubling me a bit. I've become interested in the question whether they exist. What is your opinion. I will be glad if you can give me a rational explanation.

The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with text describing the movement of vertical clouds and other observations.

MOVEMENT OF VERTICAL CLOUDS - As shown for the period of 19:42 GMT 1 Aug 63 to 20:22 GMT 1 Aug 63, approximately 40 minutes after the sighting time of two blue lights observed by USAF personnel at Southampton, N. Y. The clouds showed larger variations in density and altitude, from about 8,000 feet down to 5,000 feet, compared to the normal variations of about 1,000 feet observed during the period. This high compliance with their frequencies is about 1 to 10 cycles per minute. The precise reason for this behavior of the clouds is not known, but the passage of the objects through the air may have been responsible for generating the clouds at higher levels.

- page 61 -

The image contains a map showing the northern region of Europe, including Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. There is no photograph present in this document.

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

"Is the observed phenomena, they are point-like. The position of these phenomena do not seem to correspond to any known celestial objects. The observed positions, trajectories, and movements of these phenomena do not fit with the known astronomical objects. The clouds have appeared to be connected to the phenomena, sometimes before, sometimes after. The observed size, luminosity, and behavior of the phenomena are not typical of the planets, stars, or satellites that are visible in the sky. There are observations that seem to indicate a relationship between the phenomena and the magnetic fields. The variations in azimuth from different observation sites are consistent with a stationary position of the source. The density distribution of the source indicates it is rather like a bundle of fibers. The clouds seem to be connected to the phenomena rather than the other way around. Massiveness of this phenomena and decay are not well understood."

Southampton-12, New York
9 July 1968

DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:

On 7 July 1968, at approximately 11:45 PM, Mr. Jack Huffman, resident of Southampton, New York, observed an unidentified aerial phenomenon over Mecox Bay. Mr. Huffman described the object as cigar-shaped, approximately 100 feet long and 30 feet in diameter, hovering at an altitude of about 500 feet. The object was illuminated with a red glow and emitted no sound. It remained stationary for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

Mr. Huffman immediately contacted the local police department to report the sighting. The officer on duty, Patrolman William Blake, responded to the scene but was unable to observe the object as it had already departed. Patrolman Blake interviewed Mr. Huffman and filed a report with the Southampton Police Department.

This incident has been entered into the Project Blue Book case files for further investigation.

The image contains two diagrams. The first diagram appears to be a compass or directional circle, with various labels and abbreviations around the outside. The second diagram shows a silhouetted figure standing in a landscape with hills or mountains in the background.

Now, as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

NOW IMAGINE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE COMPASS ROSE. YOU ARE AN OBSERVER OF THE PHENOMENON WHICH HAS JUST BEEN SEEN. PLACE A + ON THE COMPASS TO INDICATE WHERE THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN, AND WRITE IN NUMBERS THE APPROXIMATE DEGREES AZIMUTH FROM NORTH THAT THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST OBSERVED. INDICATE WITH AN ARROW THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT IF THE PHENOMENON MOVED ACROSS THE SKY.
 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU INDICATE ON THE COMPASS DIAGRAM THE EXACT POSITION WHERE THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST SEEN, AND THE APPROXIMATE DEGREES AZIMUTH FROM NORTH THAT IT WAS FIRST OBSERVED. THIS IS CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR ANALYSIS OF THE REPORT.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather two detailed meteorological maps or charts. The upper map appears to be a weather map showing various isobars and weather systems over a geographic area. The lower map seems to depict contour lines or wave patterns, possibly related to ocean conditions or other environmental factors.

The text describes various sightings and reports of unidentified flying objects during that time period. There is no further image or illustration provided within the document.

OCR output:

THE MAPS
JULY 22-28, 1963

The Air Force continues to receive numerous reports that originate from a wide range of sources, which describe strange phenomena in the sky, some of which defy logical explanation. Such reports range from the sighting of strange luminous objects to the observation of unusual aerial manuvers.

The reports cover a broad geographical area and stem from observations made by a variety of people in varying situations and circumstances. Every effort is made to verify and analyze each report in order to determine its nature and significance. 

Reports that are found to have possible merit are sent to the Project Blue Book team at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for further investigation and analysis. Those that are evaluated as lacking in substantial evidence or as explainable natural phenomena are eliminated from further consideration. 

The criteria used for evaluation and identification includes such factors as the credibility of the observer, the number of observers, the duration of observation, the clarity of view, the physical characteristics of the object, the maneuverability of the object, and any corroborative evidence or physical traces.

The Air Force continues to maintain an open mind with respect to the possibility of extraterrestrial visitations and will continue to investigate and analyze all reports that appear to have merit. At the same time, the Air Force cautions against premature conclusions or sensationalism, which could result in unwarranted public concern or alarm.
