Operation Blue Book

Dayton, Ohio

Major Arthur R. Quintanilla (TCDK)

I wish to relate an experience my family and I had at approximately 8:30-9:30 P.M. March 19, 1967.

We were travelling south on Gene Run Rd. The night was already dark and a cloud cover had moved over our area. Near the city limit signs of Louisville, Ky. we noticed an unusual light in the sky. This light seemed to be oscillating in different colors, that is, red, blue, green and white. The light was not steady but rather appeared to be "blinking" or flashing and seemed to cover and suggested it to be an aircraft which had landed or was preparing to land through the windshield.

The light, though unusual in color, was when suddenly appearing to be a single brilliant white light above the horizon appearing to be a star. As we drove toward the location of the light, it seemed to remain stationary. After driving about six miles toward the light, it suddenly disappeared. Later, the 2000 watt spotlight was seen no more.

The light travelled generally toward us straight course for about one minute and then passed on. We stopped at the intersection of the Gene Run Rd. from the initial sighting point.

My driver year-old son suddenly remarked something was falling from the sky. He was viewing it through the window glass. On his insistence, I looked but could not see anything unusual. The object, whatever it was, apparently passed through the light beam at a large amount of this flaming material dropping, or lumped together to the explosion or disintegration of an object.

The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed text document describing an incident involving a "darkened object" observed near Louisville, Kentucky.

Text from the document:

I immediately parked in a safe area off the right side of the road and stopped my vehicle. It was our 20 year old daughter got so we could see better. The tallest man who was sitting next to me got out and walked towards the objet, but we could still see the completely darkened obje(ct) through the windshield as it was silently hovering at the same speed as the car we were in.

After a few seconds the light and flaming material suddenly went out, the object changed direction and headed to the northwest approximately a mile or two away.

We got back into the station wagon hurriedly and drove towards the station but were unable to locate the object. I contacted the Louisville Police Department and reported what I thought I had seen.

After changing my clothes, I did not appear to change or disturb the object in any way.

There was quite a bit of traffic on Cane Run Road at the time of this sighting and several drive-in restaurants in the area, however we could see no one else around to confirm this incident.

With a yellow-orange flame the darkened object which is usually described as anything from "ten feet" to "a hundred feet" in diameter, the flame went out and the material dropped onto the ground a short distance from the position where the object had been hovering.

Following the disappearance of the light and flames, the darkened object had no navigation lights, no sound was detected, and we could detect no propulsion noise of any type which would indicate how it was operating. The station engine and jet noise was also missing during the sighting.

The call to the control center ended approximately five minutes after it began and they explained to me that they knew nothing of it and had not been notified of a similar sighting, but assured I did discuss or relate a similar sighting.

Transcribed text from the document:

I went to work on the mid-night shift a local oil refinery, and since I had heard of no disturbances, I decided to continue to work as usual. I was informed by a controller on duty that they were making routine checks of the area to observe any unusual aircraft. He also advised me that traffic of this nature would usually render a conventional aircraft useless.

Upon receiving this information, I decided to be on the alert for any sighting and I feel that my account is fairly accurate to the best of my knowledge.

I have spent three years with the air force and I feel that my account is fairly accurate to the best of my advice.

We would welcome any details or interviews concerning this incident.

Sincerely,
