The observer had sighted an object that had four blinking yellow lights on the bottom and two view slits. In her original letter, the observer stated that the UFO was the source. In her 17-page letter, she indicates it was the attention of anyone else. Apparently she sensed the fact that over 30 minutes of observation the object remained stationary.

United States of America

One might about 11.00P.M. vard out with my telescope or shortly it the moon. It had a small light or fluorescent light along the top. It hovered there and seemed tobe out a bright light. It spent about half a minute or less of a the sky.

Out of the comer of my eye an object appeared some distance away, descended and moved across my field of vision. It had a pale white light and no red or green running lights. It was only visible for a few seconds.

We have this reliably drawn from several witnesses. We have at least 3 or 4 people who observed this object. According to their reports the object was not a satellite or anything of that sort. It was high in the sky and we have attempted to reconstruct the observation but were unable to determine what this object was. Nothing they may have flown before. Perhaps an experimental aircraft from some installation near here. A bit of a puzzle.

The text in the document reads:

It was at about 11:30 p.m. Times of sircus, I made a sighted object, as you are aware, it was parked on the parking lot and seemed not to move on. After I saw it, it was the size of a small plane and seemed to have lights all around it. As the people who have seen, one of them had already called the police, and I have the license plate number my friend went to the spot.

I looked around for a sighting that I missed, but the thing is disapppeared. I have the showing home with my self in 30 minutes.

I have the showing home with my self in 30 minutes. Sincerely yours,

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, specifically a letter dated October 16, 1968 from James H. Aitken of the Community Relations Division, Office of Information, responding to a previous letter about an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. The letter discusses the process of investigating such sightings and requests that the recipient inform the office if they sight another such object.

Dear Miss ****,

This replies to your recent letter in which you reported that you had an unidentified serial object:

Without additional information, we cannot offer an explanation of what (you) reported as an "unidentified" aerial object. However, if you wish, please submit the mailing envelope or our technical people at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, can guide us in an investigation of the sighting further.

Should you ever sight another such object, please report it as soon as possible to the nearest Air Force Base. Each such case is studied carefully by assigned investigators or unidentified flying objects (UFO's). We are in a constant investigation which better position to make an on-the-spot investigation and identification than we are sitting here.

In the meantime, you might be able to identify your sighting through the materials we are sending.

Sincerely,
