10. CONCLUSION
This object could not be identified. It was observed in one spot and
moved rapidly out of sight. No sound nor exhaust was observed.

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
The object was observed for less than a minute. It was sighted at first
in one spot and then moved rapidly out of sight. No sound nor trail
was noted. Its abrupt maneuver and rapid disappearance made it
impossible to adequately observe it. Its metallic reflection and
soundless movement indicate it was probably a solid object, but its
nature could not be determined.

Unfortunately, this case still remains unknown. Although I feel any further investigation is hopeless, I would suggest that wind direction for this night be established. If from the orientation of the object it could reasonably have been a balloon with a scientific payload, but this seems unlikely.

End of report.

When I came out of our house first part overhead my car was still standing bright lights so close to the house. He started to move toward the house. I started to run was very slow because I considered calling this back in case it should come into the house and called the police brother who came out and grimed us. It continued on in a straight line toward a ring of hills about 2 miles away my oldest son explained it would crash into the fields. It some how managed to make it and disappear may the being.

MT. AIRY, MARYLAND
8 MARCH 1965

At approximately 1940 EST an observer and his son came out of a barn and noticed six red lights estimated to be about 1300 feet from the observer moving at a speed of about twenty miles per hour, toward the NE. The lights appeared to be in a straight line and at times seemed to blink. An aircraft with a white light appeared flying perpendicular to the lights. Another witness was summoned from the house and then all three observers viewed the lights. The witness stated that as it looked like a flying wing: It was a very dark night and there were no stars out. The flight was in a straight line toward the hills, two miles away. All of the observers thought the objects were aircraft and disappeared over the horizon. The lights passed between the barn and the house at an altitude of 100 - 500 ft, and again in view for a total duration of three minutes. To stimulate the sighting, one witness would take a dirigible or blimp-equipped device and place it three times of red lights along it.

COMMENTS
The outstanding factors in this sighting are the very slow speed, the flight characteristic, and the limited data available. The portion of the available data is characteristic of a balloon with a scientific payload. Attempts were made to put either of the two in the area but to no avail. The wind was out of the northwest which also conflicts with an evaluation of a balloon. With the existing data the case is listed as "unidentified" by the Air Force.

POSITION, TITLE AND COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
Report prepared by Captain Anthony L. Gilliam, AD 509925, D-4, Investigator, stating Des Movers Preparing OFFICER'S comments are as follows:
Miss [REDACTED] and Miss [REDACTED], both gave me the impression of being typical teenagers, shy, fairly intelligent, and sincere in their beliefs as to what they actually saw. Their cooperation, at all times, on answers to all questions put to them, was good. The girls have not questioned apparent since early 1961, having been checked by police.  
Through check of the area of sighting by the investigating officer revealed no additional information. Particular emphasis was placed on several for ground stones or one, banks of mounds, brush or trees, and general directions across the farm and house. The investigation in the area made possible a thorough search, but with negative results.
Before covering information received from Miss [REDACTED], a description of the area leading to the Cratsley house is needed to better understand and evaluate the facts.
The land behind the Cratsley house is level for about ten yards, forming a natural yard. The next hundred yards behind it a a slow, gradual slope and is sparsely covered by brush and weeds. After that the ground rises at a more rapid rate forming a hill roughly two (2) hundred yards from the house.

The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The hill is covered with such like the other ground, with the addition of scattered bushes and trees. Just the hill is typical Ohio rolling terrain with scattered shrubs.

Following is information given by [REDACTED] Introduction is made of a ground sighting by [REDACTED] which may or may not be connected with the original sightings, but is submitted because of the close time span between the two sightings.

On the night of the sighting, [REDACTED] tried to awaken her Mother to see the object. Her first attempt was not successful but the object had disappeared. The second attempt proved to be successful but by then the object had disappeared. Now fully awake, [REDACTED] recalled hearing about an UFO sighting on the Huntington area that evening. Her sister and Husband were broadcast to give details of what they had about the sighting. [REDACTED] daughter a girl friend who was spending the night with them and instructed both girls to draw a picture and description of what they had seen. The girls complied and their descriptions given by the girls convinced [REDACTED] that they had indeed seen something unusual. At this point she was content to pass it off as an hallucination.

On Tuesday evening, 23 March 35, the [REDACTED] family was at home watching television. Intermittently throughout the evening, reception was interrupted by a series of "unusually" broad beeping sounds. Conversation between [REDACTED] and neighbors revealed the interference was heard throughout the neighborhood. Conversation between the reporting officer and a neighbor confirmed this, although the neighbor remained from giving her name, "we are not to get involved." The weather at the time of the interference was hazy, with light rain.

The next incident occurred on Wednesday evening 24 March 35. Once again it was a dark night with reference again to rain. During a trip to the [REDACTED] home, the [REDACTED] family noticed unusual happenings.

Kitchen a plane cut the winter roven a sort of pole, sticking out of the ground in a place where are no holes. A light in the back yard was turned on but did not illuminate the pole any better. (See drawing, attachment 1 for location of sighting). The "pole" disappeared later that evening. Debts called from the bathroom that there was some kind of pole sticking up from the rear corner of the house next door. At first he thought it was the neighbors TV antenna, but a closer look showed the pole to be on the corner of the house but out beyond the corner at approximately the same position as he had seen it earlier.
At this time the witness got a flashlight and went to the rear porch, and played the beam up and down the pole. It looked like a large automobile aerial, chrome-plated, about thirty feet tall. It appeared to have no base, and was topped by a small, gold-colored ball. She then went to call her husband.
It was at this time she decided to lot describe the location of their residuce.
The incidents or the alleged inference and the pole appearance could possibly have been caused by some sort of weather phenomenon and were included in this report only because of the short man of this duration which all things indicate was some brief occurrence.
It was not available for comment on his proposed sighting on 25 March 55. (See basic letter). This too could possibly have been caused by some sort of weather phenomenon.
He confirmed that he, his wife and two neighbors, thoroughly searched the area where the "pole" appeared, with negative results.
No unusual sightings have been seen in that area since that time.

The provided image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a page of text from an old document, likely a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Eyewitness being that at a Grand Opening of some sort of "madness" during that period, also reported negative results. Due to the lack of provided evidence, and an apparent lack of weather as a factor, the cause is undetermined at this time.

March 25, 1965

Dear Sir:-

With regard to your request for information on U F 0 I with 
to report the following sighting:

Time : March 16, 1965  10:21 p.m..
Direction of travel North North East

As I was driving from Springhill, N.S. to Oxford, N.S. with my son was leaving 
a class at the Technical College in the city of Halifax, Province 
of Nova Scotia, and by coincidence I noticed a light in the sky which 
I thought was some sort of aerial display for the public.

After watching this for a second or so, the light appeared to be some 
sort of jet thrust pack further to the west, and then it appeared to 
some sort of violet bluish flame(like that of an acetylene torch) was
emitted from the craft, and suddenly the light disappeared, and then
the lights disappeared behind some clouds.

My conclusion is that I believe what I saw might have been a vehicle of 
some sort of some kind, light in front and above the three lightstages diagram,
that I had not previously noticed from me, and the lights appeared to be some 
sort of violet bluish flame(like that of an acetylene torch) was emitted
from the craft, and suddenly the light disappeared, and then the lights
disappeared behind some clouds.

My conclustion is that I believe what I saw might have been a vehicle of 
some kind, light in front and above the three lightstages diagram,
that I had not previously noticed from me, and the lights appeared to be some 
sort of violet bluish flame(like that of an acetylene torch) was emitted
from the craft, and suddenly the light disappeared, and then the lights
disappeared behind some clouds.

I trust that my account of the sighting will help correlate other 
reports on this unusual phenomena of this unidentified vehicle.

I have been at the Cape Kennedy operation while on vacation and
have witnessed some launchings, and during the latter part of January and
first part of February, I saw other rocket firings at night from Halifax, N.S.
The speed was too slow, and the height too low. Your comments will be 
appreciated at your convenience.

I spotted a flying object going
North from eerng to where the month
was light. It appeared to be about
1/2 the size of the moon and was making
a very strange motion-- it would go
very fast and then suddenly slow down
to a crawl with a very erratic course.
At times it appeared to be under
controlledflight or it may have be
because of the sharp turns
this object took from North to West.

DEARBORN OBSERVATORY

EVANSTON, ILLINOIS 60201

May 26, 1965

Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr.
USAF 9194
PID Wright Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Major:

I would like to report on my telephonic investigation of the Mt. Airy, Maryland case of March 5, 1965. I had a long telephone conversation with the father and with the sons in question, and with the daughter and son-in-law of the family. It seems that they can't pick any holes in their story. They were followed by strange light parallel to state highway 40, which is about a quarter of a mile away and which has quite a bit of traffic on it. The seventeen-year-old son was with the father when it happened and they stopped along the road to look at the light, which seemed to be quite near. There is some possibility that the event might have an explanation in terms of the radiation from jets or some such manner, but I am not too sure. The lights seemed to be quite bright and to have quite an intensity.

Mr. Brown is an instrument maker at the Bureau of Standards, but also does a good bit of amateur astronomy.

The outstanding things in his mind were the very slow speed (as if attached to a balloon), the floating sensation, and the extreme closeness of the lights, one of which was so bright that it simulated the sunlight and pinpoints could be clearly seen on its surface. These lights appeared to be under intelligent control and to be maneuverable. 

Mr. Brown felt, as I did, that it was just something I couldn't understand, a bit different and a bit strange. He doesn't believe that he nor his sons would shorten his reaction time. I checked him about his reaction and he seems to still be very puzzled and has been kidded a bit about it. Someone gave him a book on air craft contaminants, but he sone read that through and felt it didn't pertain to this case. I gave him some issues of Flying Saucers - whatever, but lights appeared to be attached to something, the whole thing could be explained if we could establish the presence of a large glider headed for Camp David; however, no green or white lights, only red, and speed seemed too slow.

Sincerely,

- page 48 -
