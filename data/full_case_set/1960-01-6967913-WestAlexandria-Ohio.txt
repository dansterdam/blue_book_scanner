To whom it may concern:

I awoke this morning at 6:00 and looked out the window and an extremely bright light in the sky. It appeared to be circular and hovered over the road near my home. It moved around. I don't believe in those flying saucer stories but there must be some explanation. The Object appeared to be approximately 130 S. E. of compass N (just a cheap compass) at approx 2' o'clock. Last seen at about 6:12.
