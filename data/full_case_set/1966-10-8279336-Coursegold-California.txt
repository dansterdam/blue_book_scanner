10. CONCLUSION: Insufficient data for evaluation

11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS:
Observers have been watching a pulsating and glowing light, reddish, amber, and green, occasionally remaining stationary and movable in a rapidly changing manner. One observer says he has been watching these objects since the fall of 1960, but that they only in the last three weeks had the noticed the sudden increase in the frequency of these sightings.
Capt. APB was to forward information as required in AFR 200-2, but to date this information has not been received; therefore, the case is being carried as insufficient data.
