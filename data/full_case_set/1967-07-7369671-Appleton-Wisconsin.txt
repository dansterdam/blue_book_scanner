Dear Sir,
Couldn't wait any longer before letting you know the results of my investigation of the reported sighting of a UFO which I made a few nights ago. As you know, I reported I had seen it on the night in question, and I hope I could be of some help on this case.
I am sorry I was unable to get more data. As I stated in my letter, I did see an object which was far above the usual planes and which moved with extreme speed and made no sound at all. I have two or three friends who were out with me that night, and we all felt it worth reporting. We actually drew several sketches and photos, but it is doubtful if any of this added material will be of much value, since the object only appeared for a short time and was rather indistinct.
Thank you,
(Redacted)

The text of the report is as follows:

TPDT (UFO) Lt Col Quintanilla/70916/ans/14 Jun 68

UFO Observation & Photographs, 7 July 1967

1. Reference your unidentified observation and subsequent photographs of 7 July 1967. Photo analysis has been accomplished with the following results:

Visible examination reveals that the "unidentified object" is partially visible in the frames merged of the negative, and that the imagery is not the result of double exposure or retouching. The object is not visible in its entirety due to the fact that about 1/5 inch has been cropped from the left margin of the negative. The object appears to be symmetrical and contained what appear to be structure of medium size that extends from the center of the bottom edge of the negative almost to the center of the frame. Source indicates the entire length is attached to his neighbor's house.

2. The object appears as an elliptical in shape. Its length being about twice its width. It displays medium reflectivity and is fuzzy around the perimeter. A narrow band displaying slightly greater reflectivity is positioned along its minor axis. No reason or purpose has been determined for this change in reflection.

3. The exposure was made with a fixed focus camera having a nominal focal length of 105 inches. Bracket settings indicate the object was 100-200 feet in distance and covered about 200 feet above his neighbor's house. The clarity of detail and relative size of the antenna indicate that source was perhaps 75 feet from the object as it was about 200 feet from the object as it.

4. If, indeed, the object had the 100-200 foot diameter (as stated by source) it would have had to be 500-1,600 feet from the camera to produce the imagery recorded.

- page 8 -

The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. There is no photograph present in this particular page, only text.

Transcription of the text:

"Produce the image size shown, and therefore would be in relatively sharp focus. Contrarily, if it were hovering 220 feet from the camera, its distance would have to be approximately 30 feet to produce the image size shown, and it would also be in sharp focus.

The object appears to have dimensions, but could not be estimated as great as those estimated by source, as great as those estimated by source, and does not appear to have dimensions as great as those estimated by source.

1. Although the object on the negative cannot be identified, it appears to be circular in planform and situated between the camera and foreground. Its diameter is estimated to be 1 to 1.5 feet at a range of approximately 100 to 120 feet.

2. We are returning your original negative and photograph. Thank you for reporting your observation to the Air Force.

Greg Verhoeven, age 14, stopped at the station with a photo he took of a U.F.O. This photo showed an oval, flat object in the sky. Greg states this U.F.O. came out of the east and hovered for about 15 minutes, and then went straight up and disappeared. The object was estimated to size at 100 to 200 feet in diameter. It was lower than an inflight air craft.
The photo was taken with box camera number 620, black and white film and processed by Kodak photo shop. These photos are being forwarded to Patterson, Air Force Base for review.

PHOTO ANALYSIS REPORT
NR 63-29
DATE OF REPORT 16 May 1968
SUBJECT UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
LOCATION Appleton, Wisconsin
DATE 7 July 1967
PHOTOGRAPHY: One Argoflex 75 negative and print, two FTD enlargements
PURPOSE: This report is in reply to Work Order Number 68-45, submitted by Major Quintanilla, requesting analysis of an "unidentified object" image.
ANALYSIS: Examination reveals that the "unidentified object" is partially visible along the left margin of the negative. The object is mostly visible in the first enlargement, but is less visible in the second enlargement due to the fact that about 1/5 inch has been cropped from the negative during the enlargement process. It therefore could be assumed that about 80 percent of the imagery remains. Also imaged is a narrow band which extends from the center of the bottom edge of the negative almost to the right edge. This band appears to be a natural effect and not an anomaly.
The object's image is elliptical in shape, its length being about twice its width. It displays medium reflectivity and is fuzzy around the perimeter. A narrow band displaying slightly greater reflectivity is noticeable along its minor axis. No reason or purpose is known.
The exposure was made with a fixed focus camera having a nominal .26 foot focal length about 200 feet above his neighbor's house at the time he made the exposure. The clarity of detail and relationship of the antenna installation on his neighbor's house indicates that the object was not more than 220 feet from the object as it hovered 200 feet above the house.
If it indeed, had the 100-200 foot diameter (as stated by source) it would have had to be 800-1,600 feet from the camera to produce the image size shown, and therefore would be in relative sharp focus. Contrarily, if it were hovering 220 feet from the camera, its diameter would have to be approximately 35 feet to produce the image size shown, and it would also be in sharp focus.
The object imaged on the photograph, not being in sharp focus, could not have been hovering, and does not appear to have dimensions as great as those estimated by source.

Report of Investigation

Subject: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 

Date of Occurrence: 7 July 1967
Location: Appleton, Wisconsin

On 7 July 1967, at approximately 2300 hours, Mr. John Doe, a resident of Appleton, Wisconsin, reported sighting an unidentified flying object in the sky over his residence. 

Mr. Doe stated that he was outside in his backyard when he observed a bright light moving across the sky in a northeasterly direction. The object appeared to be elliptical in shape and was traveling at a high rate of speed. Mr. Doe estimated the object's altitude to be approximately 1,000 feet.

Date of Sighting: July 21, 1967 
Time of Sighting: Approx. 11:45 p.m. CDT
Location of Sighting: Appleton, Wisconsin
Weather Conditions: Clear and starry sky

On July 21, 1967, at approximately 11:45 p.m. CDT, Mr. Carl Appleton observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over Appleton, Wisconsin. 

Mr. Appleton stated that he was outside his home, looking at the clear, starry night sky, when he noticed a bright light moving rapidly across the sky. He described the object as round in shape, with a bright, bluish-white light emitting from it. The object appeared to be moving at a very high rate of speed.

Mr. Appleton estimated the object was several thousand feet in altitude and was traveling in a southwesterly direction. He stated that the object was visible for approximately 10-15 seconds before disappearing from view.

Mr. Appleton reported the sighting to the local police department, who in turn notified the proper authorities. An investigation was conducted, but no definitive determination was made as to the identity of the unidentified flying object.
