The image contains a diagram and some text instructions, but no photograph. The diagram appears to be a sketch or drawing showing the trajectory of an unidentified flying object. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine a scenario and draw a picture showing the motion of the object.

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky-line) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sky-line) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
