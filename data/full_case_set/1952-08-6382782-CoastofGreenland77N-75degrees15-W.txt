UNITED STATES ATLANTIC FLEET
AIR FORCE
PATROL SQUADRON TWENTY THREE

On 29 August 1952, while on a cosmic balloon tracking flight, I observed the balloon at about 71,000 feet at about 1955Z. I was sitting in the pilot's seat on the port side of the aircraft and was circling slightly to the left on a heading of approximately 060T when the balloon released the parachute and sent the instrument package to the ground. The instrument package descended at a rate of approximately 2,000 feet per minute and I was flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet.

There was an undercast. * * * * I was flying a TF-2 at a speed of about 150 knots. To my knowledge, this was the first cosmic air traffic in which I had participated.

As I closed in on the balloon, it appeared to be a glassy, transparent type structure. I observed three objects, slightly smaller than the balloon, shaped like round discs and they were circling the balloon. However, this impression vanished when I realized they were in reality pennant-shaped patterns with the main balloon. As the instrument package descended, I was tracking it and forming a diaond-shaped pattern with the main balloon, the two objects I had observed, and myself.

I called "IT CALLS" as I was in the co-pilot's seat and because of the relative position of the balloon and the fact that we were in a half standard cat left turn did not observe them as the main concern centered on the package descending. As the balloon shrank in size, the objects had disappeared. I called the "Icebreaker" upon sighting the objects and while they were still within view and asked how many objects were to have been released. They replied that only one had been.

The image contains a report from the United States Atlantic Fleet Air Force Patrol Squadron Twenty Three. The report describes an incident on 29 August 1952, where the squadron observed three unidentified objects while tracking a cosmic balloon at an altitude of 10,000 feet. The report states that the objects moved rapidly, changed direction, and disappeared within about 2 minutes, and that the objects showed no trail or exhaust and made no sound. The report is signed by a Lieutenant Commander.

Text from the document:

UNITED STATES ATLANTIC FLEET
AIR FORCE
PATROL SQUADRON TWENTY THREE

On 29 August 1952, at about 1555Z, while on a cosmic balloon tracking
flight near the land of Greenland, we observed the following: Three brightly
lighted objects in a triangular formation. I observed them through the astro-dome at an altitude of 10,000
feet with an RCCG foot instrument and instantly unlimited above that. We were in a PBY-2 aircraft flying in a northerly direction at about 150 knots. The three objects were from the southward, coming about 25 knots. The balloon was
on our right; the wind was from the northward. As the three objects came abreast of us, they appeared to stop and hover for about 2 minutes and then moved rapidly off and disappeared in about 5 seconds. They showed no trail or exhaust nor means of propulsion. During the observation I was an communication with DUTY OFFICER and he lost the sighting in the area.
