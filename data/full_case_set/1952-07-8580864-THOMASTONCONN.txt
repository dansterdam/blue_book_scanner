SUBJECT: Flying Discs - Observational Report

1. During the past several weeks a large number of unidentified aerial objects were observed and reported in the Thomaston, Connecticut area. These observations were made by various reliable civilian and military personnel, and were reported to the Commanding General, EADF, for evaluation.

2. Two (2) aircraft of the Connecticut Air National Guard, while on routine flight training, observed a metallic, disc-shaped object under visual contact on 19 July 1952. The pilots stated that the object appeared to be about 40 feet in diameter, and was hovering at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. The object was observed for a period of approximately 10 minutes, and then accelerated at a terrific speed and disappeared from view.

3. On 20 July 1952, Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, Chief, Analysis Section, Projects Officer, Technical Analysis Division, Aircraft and Propeller Branch, T-2, Intelligence, T-2, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, while on a visit to this area, interviewed witnesses and conducted an on-site investigation. He obtained corroborative evidence from reliable civilian and military personnel. Captain Ruppelt stated that, in his opinion, the observations were authentic.

UNCLASSIFIED
The lower object appearing toward the front appeared very black, when the upper part was a brilliant bluish color. It steered to the left and appeared to be very black. Only one such object was sighted and it passed out of sight below the horizon. The object appeared larger than a star, and seemed to be metallic in appearance and shape, being somewhat elongated. The witness states that the object moved much faster than any conventional aircraft and disappeared far more rapidly than any jet powered craft would have.
Laboratories, incorporated, Thomaston, Connecticut, divided these tests with statements are reliable and believed correct, by interviews. Interviewed the witness and did not find anything that would lead to conclusion, and believes this witness is telling the truth.
Witness advised that at this time of sighting the weather was extremely clear, with no clouds or wind, with limited visibility westward.
