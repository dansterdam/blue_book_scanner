The image contains two photographs. The photograph on the left shows what appears to be a bright object in the sky with several branching streaks or lines. The photograph on the right shows a similar bright object in the sky, but with a more diffuse or cloudy appearance. The text below the images states that these objects are referred to as "Venus--So Bright--Causing Quit A Stir" and are described as the sighting of the planet Venus, which appeared unusually bright in the sky.

DAYTON, OHIO, MONDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1957 
Entered at Second Class Matter Post Office Box 1371 (Dayton. Ohio

VENUS THE FLYING STAR, last night caused a "STIR" according to reports. This is an unusual brilliance of Venus, compared with its usual steady glow. Last night at 6:30 p.m. George Adams said he noticed this and photographed it. The pictures shown here are the results of his camera catching what he claims is an unusual phenomenon of the planet Venus. The brightest star in our sky tonight, as this is written, is the planet Venus, commanding attention in the western horizon. (Staff photo by George Adams)
