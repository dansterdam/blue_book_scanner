UFO SIGHTING, 9 May 65, Mequon, Wisconsin

TO: HQ USAF SAFOIC (Mrs Hunt)
       Wash D C 20330

A Mr. has requested an evaluation of his observation on 9 May 1965, of a light of about third magnitude in the sky above Mequon, Wisconsin. His report is a suggested reply: 

Dear Mr.

Since you say you are familiar with the scientific type laser, you will recognize that the coherent nature of laser light makes it visible with the exception from places at which the beam is dispersed. Furthermore, the second magnitude of the object you observed indicates that the light was much brighter than this.

Plans for military aircraft in the atmosphere, such as flares, do not carry the right characteristics of an aircraft observation.

Dear Sir:

I am contacting the Air Force in regards to the incident. At 9:30 pm May 9, 1965 I observed an object traveling in a northerly direction along the eastern horizon at an altitude from 4000 ft. to 6500 ft. The object was visible for about 90 seconds before sight, being obscured part of the time while moving through a stratus cloud formation. I tracked it visually with binoculars.

It was a clear night with the exception of sparse clouds. It was calm at this time, not even a slight breeze. The object made no audible sound and about the brightness of a star.

I contacted the FAA today about this. They said scheduled flights in that area at that time. The FAA said the Air Force has been monitoring with some type of aircraft used in the tail section of some jet aircraft and said it may have been what I was viewing.

If possible I would like some information on this "laser" type incident.
I am generally familiar with scientific type laser. This has to do with the amplification of light beams with radiation. I do not know if this is what the FAA was referring to however. I would appreciate any information you can give me concerning the above described incident.

Thank you.

Air Force Office of Information
Public Information Division
Washington D.C.

Sirs,
On May 10, 1965 I reported the sighting of a U.F.O. in the Milwaukee area of Wisconsin to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. I was later contacted and told that my letter of 10 May 65 would be forwarded to this office in Washington D.C.
It seems to me that nearly three months is ample time for you to have heard nothing further and I am getting damn impatient.
I was told I may have been sighting a new experimental light in the tall section of an Air Force jet. I would like you have received my original letter some time ago which would give you a fully explained account of my May 9 sighting, will therefore not go into more detail here.
I will be expecting to receive a reply promptly. I hope one, within your limits of comment on such affairs.

Mr. -- Avenue
