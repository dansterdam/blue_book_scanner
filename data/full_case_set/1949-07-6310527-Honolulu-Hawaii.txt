balloon-like object appear. The second object
traveled from the south until reach a position
above th- first balloon, which at appeared to
circle. After circling the first balloon, the
second changed course and both then proceded

7. Major Claude V. Millis, TSAT, District Air Inspector,
Hawaiian Air Force Base, Oahu, state of On 23 July 1949 th-
re no missions were being release= ir the Air Force long-ran-
for some time.

8. LCDR A. E. Avard, USN, Officer-in-Charge, Fleet Weather
Central, Pearl Harbor, Oahu, I interviewed on 23 July 1949,
disclosed thit his organization had released n> notosone

Puligio at dook Sni1-20, Pearl Harbor. This balloon was
5'6-9" in diameter at sea level, rose about a ile every
five minutes, and in the opinion of personnel at Fleet
Weather Central could h' e been seen from th< reort fr
which rs. rnold resides some time between 1030 and 1100.

It was ascertained at Fleet weather Central that the ra-
dioonde is composed of a balloon to which is attached a

balloon. No other cfficial agency other thitn those inter-
viewed is known to release balloons o: any kind in the ter-
ritory of Hawaii.

6. A description of th« rnoldsonc wms nir e s!'ed r:s,
cannon and sho was asked if she could no' .ive mistaken the
swinging box for another "balloon-like object." She wns
adamant in denying this possibility, stating that she
definitely saw two balloon-like objects functi>'" nppr 'tan
eight feet. Furthermore, It is the opinion of the reprt-
Ing ag'ent that Mrs. rnold could not have seen the radio-
sonde released from Pearl Armor sic., it ascended from
Pearl Harbor proceeding in a westerly direction. The
reported issue lies about five miles east of Pearl rbor
a.d since rrs. rnold wns behind her house the view towar^
the west was blocked to her.

e. Fleet Weather Central statistics show that on the
morning of Wednesday, 20 July 1949 wind conditins above
Oahu were as follows:

0 - 6,000 feet, east wind, 20 knots
6,000 - 8,000 feet, relatively no wind
8,000 - 10,000 feet, south wind, 10 knots

UNCLASSIFI 27 July 1949

Subj: Flying Saucers over Ahu Airport, Honolulu.

Project 10073.C 1949.07.27.0530Z. A high altitude flying
balloon at an altitude up to 65,000 feet would be traveling
in a westerly direction at a speed of 20 knots. Another
balloon at an altitude of 60,000-70,000 feet would obviously
ascend the first and would approach the first balloon from
the south - that is assuming that a second aid was designed
this, it could conceivably hover over the first in the 60,000-
70,000 foot level giving the effect of circling the first,
and then upon descending to the 60,000 foot level take off
toward the west. No explanation for the origin of the
"balloons" sighted by r/s ██████ could be obtained from
official sources.
