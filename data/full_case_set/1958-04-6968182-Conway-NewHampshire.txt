PART II Comments and Analysis
8. Analysis:
1. Additional factors.
The two fighter aircraft sighted by Capt. Stubbs and his crew have not been
identified.
From the information obtained from Syracuse, N.Y. (13th) fighter-interceptor
flying at 25,000' at 5:30 P.M. with another aircraft 3 miles away not in sight,
no further information was available.
As a result of the investigation, the area of the sighting reported no unidentified objects
at that time. Hence, the Capt. and Crew have been cleared.
The analysis indicates the selection of the observing stations at 8:00, 9:00,
9:30, and 19:30 hrs. at Danbury, Atlanta, N.C., Newark, Ontario,
as the sighting reports indicate the positive identification of others.
From the evidence presented, the object sighted by Capt. Stubbs' crew and
the flight of one fighter aircraft could not be positively identified. It is possible that
the known radar contact was made - The fact that this object was
described as 3 times the size of the fighter aircraft does not account for the
distance estimate at 5 miles. The object was never seen again.
3. Statement supporting comment and analysis.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

PROJECT: BLUE BOOK

SUBJECT: (NAME AND ADDRESS) USAF (USAF) ZAN-DDT-235

4/3/58 At approximately 2035 local time, an object was sighted in the sky which could have been a very high altitude aircraft or a satellite. 
 Appearance was a bright white light moving at a fairly high speed. It went completely out of sight after a few minutes. There was no visible trail or sound.
 In the opinion of an experienced T-47 crew, this object must be identified and actively followed under circumstances as described.

WILLIAM E. GREGORY 
1st Lt. USAF 
Investigating Officer

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
The preceding draw is a graphic rendition of a possible T-47 target. As such, the apparent color and altitude are consistent with the visual sighting described. No contrails or other visible indications of aircraft characteristics were observed. However, the possibility of a very high altitude aircraft or satellite cannot be eliminated.

A check of our records indicates that our only balloon released about this time was a small 100-gram pilot balloon released from our Syracuse or Albany, N.Y. weather station at about 1300EDT.

Large radionde balloons are released from Canadian weather stations such as Toronto and Ottawa, etc. You might contact the Canadian weather service on these. Possibly even some radio wind target devices are released by some of their stations.

There is no photograph included in this document from Project Blue Book. The image appears to be a typed report describing an observation of a round, silver object in the sky above Conway, New Hampshire on April 19, 1958. The report provides details about the object's altitude, visibility, and characteristics, as well as weather conditions in the area at the time.

19 April 1958
Conway, New Hampshire near Syracuse, New York

On 19 April the crew of a B-47 observed a round, silver object in the sky above them. The altitude of the B-47 was 32,000 and excellent VFR conditions existed. The observation took place between Syracuse, New York and about twenty miles southwest of Pittsburgh AFS, New York. At first, all crew members thought object to be a balloon, but object did not disappear as rapidly as expected. The object was clearly visible for twenty minutes.

Enlargement of the photo showed a perfectly round, transparent like object similar to plastic balloons. U.S. Weather Bureau and Navy charts showed a high altitude balloon in the area.

6/9/59, Approx 3:20 a.m.
Walpole, New Hampshire
4 young adults saw a bright light in the sky with a peculiar U.F.O. contly one or two times, seemed to be stationary for most part and then would make a long swiftdescent and then ascend again.
Mr. Keene observed it through binoculars and it appeared to be a solid object changing colors from bright white to reddish.

TO: Commander, 
ATIC (ATIC - PROJECT BLUE BOOK)
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE
OHIO, USA

1. Reference subject report and a disk alias submitted to take further action. The slides and photographs were of poor quality, it is recommended that no further action be taken.

2. In coordination with the U.S. Air Force manager service, it was determined by a study of detailed Balloons and Airborne Material data that the object observed on 18 April 1959 was a Radiosonde - CGN-4A (Special) carried by a weather balloon. Positive identification was made, based on April 1959 data.

3. In view of the fact that the description as given is descriptive and its travels slowly was to about the conclusion that what was observed was a Radiosonde - CGN-4A as determined by the data. The object was Balloon No. 6-959.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: (Sightings) (New York)
ACTIVITY SUBMITTED REPORT: Director of Intelligence, ATIC

SPAHN EMBARKATION & SUPPLY CO., INC.
Plattsburgh Air Force Base, New York

1/ Lt William R. Cheuncey
CREW OF P-47D Aircraft

APR 26-2, 5 February 1958
SUBJECT: (Sightings) (This individual reports for observers)

ITO: (Indicated Flying Object)

SUMMARY (Observers, which amplified the salient factors of narrative report. Begin narrative that on 19 Force Item ground?)

On 19 April at 1925Z, the crew of P-47D 52-0050, Capt. H.T. Stanka aircraft Commander, observed a silver object in the sky above them. The altitude of the P-47 was 32,000 and excellent VFR conditions existed.

At first, all crew members thought object to be a balloon, but object did not disappear as rapidly as expected. The object was definitely an artificial/25 kts/40 and closely circled the P-47 for approximately 8 minutes. 

This observation took place between Syracuse, N.Y. and about 20 miles southwest of Plattsburgh Air Force Base, New York.
