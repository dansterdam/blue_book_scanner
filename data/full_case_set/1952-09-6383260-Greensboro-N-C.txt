The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document with text describing an unidentified flying object sighting.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

At about 7:00 P'clock on September the 12 in front of my Service Station in Greensboro, North Carolina, I saw a bright object pacing my car for several miles. This object gave off a light which was travilling at a very high rate of speed. It was as large or larger than my car and was solid grey in color. When it came into view it was at an altitude of about 500 to 600 feet and when it went out of sight it was at an altitude of about 300 feet. When it came into view it was travelling at about 600 miles per hour and when it went out of sight it was travelling at a much higher rate of speed.

I have never seen any falling stars and meteors, but this was larger, closer, and different from any I have seen before.  

The object appeared to be about a mile and a half away and 12 to 15 feet in diameter.

My seeing this object, was not a hallucination as I saw it as long as 60 to 90 seconds and it was so close I could see it plainly.

On Friday afternoon, September 12, 1952, at dusk my attention was called to an unusual object in the sky. This object was found to shape and white in color with a blinking sequence of a darker color.  It was traveling towards the northwest at a very high rate of speed.

The image does not contain any photographs. However, it does contain a detailed Air Intelligence Information Report that provides the following information:

A flying object was reported sighted in the Lumberton, North Carolina area on 12 September 1952 at 2359z. Four witnesses at four different observation points confirmed its appearance. This report covers sightings from Lake Waccamaw to Fayetteville, North Carolina. The object was traveling 32 to 34 mph. The object was of small shape with a trail three times the length of the body. The speed was so fast that most witnesses only got a hurried glimpse. According to local newspapers, a meteor was observed at approximately the same time, day, place, and direction of flight.

- page 21 -

The image contains a scanned document from the Air Intelligence Information Report, part of Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photographs. I will now proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

(1) A large white object reported to be the size of an automobile and cigar-shaped with a white light at the head and a blue trailing light at the tail end. The tail is reported to be of the trail type. This tail was reported by one witness to be 3 times as large as the body of the object. All 3 witnesses described the object travelling at a tremendous speed. In all cases, the object disappeared into the horizon. There is no sound recorded by the witnesses. 

(2) Time of sighting - 1900 (2332 hours) Standard Time, 12 September 1952. Object was only sighted for a very few seconds because of speed.

(3) All the sightings were visual.

(4) & (5) A. R. Lamberton, North Carolina, sighted the object at the above time from the Lamberton Textile Company plant located near the Court House in Lamberton, North Carolina. Mr. Lamberton has had 33 years in the Army Air Corps and is now employed as a Reserve Officer. In Confidential Reports he mentally turned this incident reports into the Directorate of Intelligence, Headquarters Ninth Air Force, personally did not see the flying object but stated in a later conference that at least 15 other persons within the Lamberton area had also seen the flying object.

(6) A. R. Lamberton, driving on Highway 301, 3 miles north from Lamberton, North Carolina, reported sighting the object flying directly in front of his windshield from right to left. The 2 above witnesses said that the angular height of the ground was approximately 30 degrees. In both cases, the object was moving from the South East to the North West.

(7) The third witness, a woman, was sighted 5 miles East of Elizabethtown, North Carolina, He reported sighting the object immediately after dark. He reported the object to be between 15 and 20 degrees.

There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a text-based document from Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

Here is the text output from the document:

AF FORM 312—PART II
APPROVED: 1 JUNE 1952

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Directorate of Intelligence 
of the tail of the flying object.
(4) Another person in the vicinity of Lake Waccamaw, a distance of 45 
miles from Lumberton, reported sighting this same object.
General reliability of witnesses seem to be usually reliable with a probably 
true report.
(5) At 1910 Eastern Standard Time, 12 September 1952, scattered clouds at 
4,000 feet and 14,000 feet. Estimated ceiling was 25,000 feet, visibility 15 miles. 
Wind North North East by 4 miles. The last rain reported in the area 1405 Eastern 
Standard Time and a generally clear condition will until 2300 Eastern Standard Time. 
No reports were made on the wind drift conditions because of poor weather.
(7) The Fayetteville, N.C. Fayetteville Observer reported on 13 September 1952
... of Fayetteville had seen a huge ball with a tail, heading North West after 
1900 Eastern Standard Time 12 September 1952. He reported the color as a greenish-
blue; the newspaper reported the object as a meteor. Several newspapers in Raleigh, 
North Carolina, it is reported, carried articles about the sighting of this meteor.
(8) No further visual sightings or photographs are available.
(9) No information on motion picture camera exists.
(10) There is no air traffic in the general area at the reporting time.

COMMENTS OF INVESTIGATING OFFICERS:
1. I have interviewed the 3 witnesses mentioned in the above report. All 
reports, in my opinion, can be considered reliable. If the report from Lake Wacca-
maw is true, the path followed by the object checks with all of the observations
of the witnesses. This would place the object running south east to north west 
15 miles above Lake Waccamaw as a point approximately 10 miles south of Fayetteville. 
Fayetteville. The witness at the point East of Hillsborough reported the object 
to have a flat degeneracy, whereas the other two said that it was definitely round.

Washington 25, D. C. 

Dear Sir:

Enclosed you will find two reports which are self explanatory. I desire to submit the following information as a strange object in the sky on the night of September 12, 1952. These people reported the sighting to me because they know me to be active in the Naval Air Reserve and a Naval Aviator. Both of these militers have had considerable experience in flying, this matter came to my attention when your Major Rood who in turn asked me to handle the matter and enclose a statement which they subsequently furnished.

Since obtaining these statements I have talked with several persons who also saw this object and find that the basic description is about the same with all of them, one of these persons is Mr. Arthur Jefferson of the Army Reserve Corps. One person in the vicinity of Lake James and elsewhere, N.C. and others.

If there is any further information you desire me to secure I will be glad to do so.

Very truly yours,
