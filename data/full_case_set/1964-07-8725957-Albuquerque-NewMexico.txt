The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from the Aeronautical Systems Division of the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, titled "Evaluation Report". The document outlines an analysis and evaluation of a suspected rock sample, including details such as the material composition, X-ray diffraction patterns, and infrared spectrum analysis.

EVALUATION REPORT

Examination and Analysis of Suspected Rock Sample

REPORT NO.: MAX 64-74
PROJECT NO.: 23102
MANUFACTURER: SUBMITTED BY: 1/LT R.J. Quintrellina

I. INTRODUCTION
To conduct analysis of rock-like sample to determine its characteristics.

II. ACTUAL DATA
1. The sample was submitted for analysis and assigned Analytical Branch No. C-14247.
2. The results are as follows:
a. Chemical Spectrography:
   Element   Estimated %   Element    Estimated %
   Si        29.2         Al          8.5
   Mg        5.1          Ca          2.3
   Fe        1.0          Cr          Trace
   Mn        Trace        Co          Trace
   Ti        Trace        Ni          Trace
   Mg        Trace        Na          Trace
b. X-Ray Diffraction patterns:
   The results show presence of 3120-B sample is mostly amorphous and resembles pumice.
c. Infrared Spectrum analysis:
   Infrared spectrum shows lack of any organic materials. From bands observed the sample appears to be a form of inorganic silicate.
