1. The Air Technical Intelligence Center has received your message (RCR TIR-1622) concerning sighting of an unidentified object on 13 July 1953 at 2130 EST. This command has carefully checked its files and records and finds no previous reports of this sighting. However, your report indicates rapid variation in speed and altitude and erratic maneuvers as observed which is characteristic of some of the sightings reported to date.

2. Coordination of this case will continue and you will be advised of the USAF Technical Report when completed. Your cooperation in furnishing additional data is appreciated.

There is no photograph present in this document. This appears to be a typewritten letter from Allen Hynek of the Emerson McMillin Observatory at The Ohio State University, addressed to Capt. Ruppalt and Lt. Olsson. The letter discusses observations made at the Shaw AFB in South Carolina.

THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
HOWARD L. BEVIS, PRESIDENT
COLUMBUS 10

EMERSON MCMILLIN OBSERVATORY
27 July 1953

Dear Capt. Ruppalt and Lt. Olsson:

Here are my comments on the last few items that were sent to me concerning the Navy expressions. I hope this information is useful. The other two cases are definitely more puzzling, particularly the recent one at Bellingham?? and can be dismissed as more conventional, although the report should be filed for future reference. Little can be judged about it with the information we have this far.

The Shaw AFB one may have been a fireball but certainly an unusual one. Therefore, this case should be followed up. Then perhaps, after looking at the overall situation, something worthwhile could be advised.

I shall be in New Mexico on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (28,29,30) and will take the opportunity to discuss the following with Dr. Clason. His insights probably could shed some light on the situation. I shall be back in Columbus on Friday, July 31.

Let you be fearful, this trip is not being charged to the project. Through if some legitimate expenses occur, I shall of course do so. I certainly hope to see you at least once before I leave.

Cordially,

Allen Hynek

18 - Very probably a meteor. Sending questionnaire. Ask your confirmation.
13 - Sending two questionnaires on this one since aerial and ground observation combined. Again this seems like a fast-flying object.
11 - Possibility have or upper air research balloons. Although our tracks on Moby Dick balloons show none in Arkansas for this date.

UAR activity starting from Carolina, area, prepare. Sending questionnaires to various observers involved. This is worth (COLDS) for local balloon release. Carrying this as unsolded.

Dear Dr. Hynek:

It has been a visiting since we have received any comments on the sightings and analysis to be given the cases. I am clearing base on 31 July but will have to see you if at all possible at Shaw AFB before I leave. I am going to Washington this Thursday this week on Press Release and new AF regulation for this project and expect to die to IV project in console.

Capt Ruppelt is due back today and are anxious to see him, and as I think I have told you, he will be predicting this project until my replacement arrives.

Best regards,

Bob Olsson
