The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch and diagram. The sketch shows a curved line with instructions to place an "A" on the line to show the height of the object above the horizon. There is also a compass rose diagram with various angle markings. The text asks the viewer to "Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made" and to indicate changes in direction during the course.

The text in the document is as follows:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass where you first saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

29. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

4 Boys Report Seeing UFOs
Ten Objects Believed Sighted in Skies
Four Schenectady area boys claim they observed at least 10 mysterious objects in the sky as twilight was falling last night. The boys - John Terwilliger, 13, John Lane, 12, Eugene Lane, 14, and David Lane, 11 - say the objects were moving "erratically" through the sky and were "shooting rapid bright white flashes." Four of the objects were described as "saucer-shaped," one was apparently round and five were irregular in shape. The boys said the objects were at various altitudes. Their sighting was reported to the Albany Airport control tower and the Albany sheriff's office.
