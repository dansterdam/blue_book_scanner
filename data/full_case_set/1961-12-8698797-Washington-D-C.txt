29 December 1961

Major William T. Coleman
Office of the Secretary 
U. S. Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

Dear [redacted],

Things were so rushed last Tuesday in Washington that I am sure I didn't get a chance to call you or to tell you how much I appreciated your kindness in arranging the meeting with the Director of the Diamond Case. We had a very interesting discussion.

I talked some more with the principals in the "Diamond Case" but got little else that was new. From a rough check, it seems that this crystallization reached the stage it did largely because of the way it was handled all around. No navigation light was seen, a helicopter was ruled out since the object was obviously low and yet showed no signs of vertical motion. He was of the opinion that it was too low for the density altitude of the city and the altitude generally obtaining there. This makes the case interesting, perhaps, but hardly conclusive from our point of view, other than that which is directly in their pattern. He is a little weight, although I am in no position to judge this.

I certainly hope that you and Colonel Russel W. Evarstrom can come visit us this year in Evanston, Illinois. In the meantime, Very best Greetings for the New Year.

Cordially,

J. Allen Hynek
Director

CO: Major Robert J. Friend

This is present the details in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be used if they are needed.

NAME: [REDACTED]

SIGNATURE: [REDACTED] 

DATE: January 20, 1961

At about 7:45 p.m. and location as Occoquan, Virginia, stated that while I was driving along Route 1, just north of Woodbridge, I noticed a strong light or bright glow in the sky to my right and moving toward me. I realized it was not an automobile headlight, as it was much larger and brighter. As it came closer, I could see that it was shaped like a disc or oval, with intense amber colored lights around the rim. The lights appeared to be rotating, and the entire object was completely silent.

As the object passed overhead, it was only about 100 to 150 feet above my car, and I could clearly see its shape and the rotating lights. The object moved at a very rapid rate of speed, slowing slightly as it passed directly overhead. As it did so, the lights seemed to dim slightly. It then accelerated rapidly and disappeared to the north. The entire sighting lasted about 20-30 seconds.

The object was absolutely no more than 50-75 feet in diameter, and its shape was that of a disc or oval. The color of the lights was a very intense amber. I am quite certain that this was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other known type of aircraft. I immediately pulled over to the side of the road and watched the object until it disappeared. The weather was clear, there was no wind, and visibility was excellent.

- page 21 -

The image shared does not contain any photographs, but rather a handwritten document or report. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

At no time while I had the object in view did it change course or altitude, or move behind or in front of anything. The motion was smooth and speed seemed constant. I saw no port holes or other openings. The orange glow in the center portion seemed to pulse at intervals of several seconds, and what it contained, if anything, I did not or could not determine in sight.

I have described what I actually saw and have no heavier or lighter than air craft, any phenomena or temperature inversion mirage, or sun reflection.

NOTE: Enclosed is a sketch of an idea of the object might possibly have looked like. This is not a drawing as such, but an approximate toward the bottom portion, and flatter toward the center portion.

REPORT:

GENERAL PUBLIC FIELD INVESTIGATION

Subject: Possible Unidentified Flying Object Sighting
Date: December 8, 1961
Location: Washington, D.C.

On December 8, 1961, at approximately 9:15 PM, a citizen reported observing an unidentified aerial object in the sky over Washington, D.C. The object was described as circular in shape, approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter, and emitting a bright reddish-orange glow. It was reported to be hovering at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet for several minutes before abruptly accelerating and disappearing from view.

The report was forwarded to the United States Air Force's Project Blue Book for further investigation. No definitive conclusions were reached regarding the nature or origin of the observed object.

jects over the United States or elsewhere. For a brief
time such observations may be considered serious. but

aircraft, weather balloons, meteors, or other natural
phenomena. ESSO touring Service.
