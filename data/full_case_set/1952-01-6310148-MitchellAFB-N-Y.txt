AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: 
Sighting of Discrepancy aircraft.

AREA REPORTED ON:
Long Island, Kings County, New York

DATE OF REPORT:
23 January 1952 

PREPARED BY:
Capt. Joesph J. DiBiase

AS OF 23 JAN 52, Lt Jg J.B. Reilly while on a 5000 foot flight approximately 15 miles southwest of Mitchell AFB, sighted an object which had the appearance of being a large, bright, metallic, disc-shaped object. The object was approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. It hovered motionless for 30 seconds, then made an abrupt right angle turn and accelerated at an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared in 2-3 seconds. The entire sighting lasted approximately 1 minute.

SIGNIFICANCE: The object was in a limited maneuverable pattern consistent to be a balloon. However, the abrupt right angle turn and extremely high rate of speed observed are not consistent with characteristics of a balloon. No other explanation can be determined at this time. Further investigation is necessary.

PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES

The report provides details about a sighting of a bright light launching at Mitchell AFB in New York. It describes the pilot's observations and states that there was no physical evidence available. The report also mentions that the intercepted action was verified by the pilot and that "AN" shows the aircraft and object are drawn.

The text in the document is as follows:

23 January 1952

The following is a statement made by Lt James W. Zeittroger, USN, COMBASE, NAS in connection with the sighting of an unidentified flying object:

"At about 0630, 23 January 1952, and while flying at 3000 feet approximately, I subisctead to a course of 225 degrees in an attempt to catch up with an object which I had visually sighted at a distance of approximately 5 miles. This object was traveling in a southly direction at an indicated air speed of approximately 310 knots. As the object approached, I observed that it was on a heading of southwest (about 210 degrees) and traveling at a speed of approximately 500 knots.

The object was seen from above and from the side. It appeared to be several in shape, had a dull finish, and possibly 20 to 30 feet in diameter. As it approached me, the object appeared to be less than 5 feet in thickness and possibly 20 to 30 feet in diameter. After completing his turn to a position for identification, the object proceeded to climb straight up at a fantastic speed. Approximately 2 miles from me and reaching an altitude of possibly 20 to 25 thousand feet, the object made a sharp turn to the right and disappeared from sight at a distance of approximately 6 to 7 miles southwest of Mitchell Air Force Base."
