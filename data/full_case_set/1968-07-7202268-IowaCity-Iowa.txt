TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

INFORMATION WHICH YOU FEEL IS PERTINENT, BUT WHICH IS NOT ACCURATELY COVERED IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE.

Aircraft passing over Iowa City at 10:40 PM, Commanding officer, first thought an experimental aircraft from the ground. But this did not appear normal due to the speed and low altitude over the city and the fact that the aircraft did not have any running lights nor did it appear to be an aircraft that was leaving or heading to the municipal airport in Iowa City. The aircraft was about 200 to 300 feet over the roof tops and was moving at a very high rate of speed, silent, and seemed to have a glow around the entire craft. The duration of the sighting was about 30 seconds to 1 minute. There was no opportunity to get a good description of the craft, only seeing it as it passed over. I suspect that it was a type of aircraft that we have not yet developed, or some type of aircraft that has not been made public. It did not appear to be any type of conventional aircraft that I am familiar with. The speed, altitude, and lack of lights and sound make me question what this could have been. I am quite sure that this was not an experimental aircraft from the municipal airport or any other source. The aircraft seemed to defy the laws of aviation that I am familiar with.

He stated the sighting occurred on July 28, 1968. under the following conditions: The appeared to be about 45 to 50 feet long and was sighted by 5 witnesses in total. The object was first viewed from the highway. It appeared to be a well defined, pointed at each end, elongated object. The object was metallic in color and appeared to be moving very slowly. It was completely silent. The object then accelerated and disappeared from view after about 2 to 3 minutes of observation.

S sincerely,

Dear Sir:

I wish to send me an official U. S. Air Force UFO form since I was an unidentified lighting reported over Iowa City, Iowa, Sometime ago. Though it has been a UFO, it did not demonstrate any characteristic behavior of a conventional aircraft. Some years ago as an undergraduate student at the University of Iowa, I took a course in Descriptive Astronomy. The object took a familiar pattern, familiar to me, immediately after the sighting, I made some rough notes describing the sighting and direction that object moved.

Please send the form to my address indicated below:

I will be glad to answer any question to the best of my ability.

Sincerely,

The light was bright and very unusual. It behav move rapidly and changed direction rapidly. at times seemed to stop more or less and look back toward the source of the light, and became dimmer, as if gathering power or speed. The light was a definite white light, very bright compared to stars or any other objects I have seen, and seemed to move with an intelligence, hovering, popping up, and then moving very rapidly out of sight. The movement was most unusual.

15. WHAT IS YOUR COMMENT IN RELATION TO THE PHENOMENON? The object was extremely bright in the sky and a bluish green color, similar to what you would see from a welding arc. It moved somewhat erratic, not in a straight path, and appeared to be circular or elliptical in shape. It disappeared behind a tree line and could not be seen as it left the area, so I cannot say for sure how it left. It appeared to be about the size of a large orange at arm's length and was estimated to have been at least a mile away. I was clearly visible to me and 3 other persons observing at the time.

A. HOW DID IT FINALLY DISAPPEAR? The object moved behind a treeline and could no longer be seen. From my vantage point it appeared to have simply vanished from sight as it passed behind the trees.

B. DID THE PHENOMENON MOVE SEEMING TO OR IN FRONT OF SOMETHING, LIKE A CLOUD, TREE, OR BUILDING AT ANY TIME? Just before it disappeared the object moved behind the treeline, so it was passing in front of the trees or building as it left the area.

Performing OCR on the text in the document:

None that I know of - this was an isolated incident with no relationship to the sightings of a commanded aircraft. The light or object seemed to move erratically - a small, extremely bright light, more or less stationary in the sky which seemed to fade in and out. It vanished from sight rather quickly. I could not determine any distinct shape, size, color or other details. The object appeared quite distance and gave an impression of a small light, not a physical object. There was no sound and no effect on myself or any animals or machinery in the vicinity. Its' appearance and disappearance was very abrupt.
