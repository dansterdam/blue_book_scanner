The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a declassified Air Force Intelligence Information Report regarding the sighting of an unidentified aerial object over the island of Kauai, Hawaii on October 7, 1950.

The text in the document is as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Unidentified Aerial Object Sighting, Hawaii
Intelligence Division, Hq USAF, Washington 25, D.C.
DATE OF INFORMATION: 9 October 1950
DATE OF REPORT: 9 October 1950
SOURCE: Lt Colonel, USAF, (Name Deleted)

SUMMARY: (Information concerning the object as described in attached paragraph. The locations of time is given in Kauai time.)

1. At 7:25 PM, local time, Saturday, October 7th, 1950, I observed a luminous aerial object over the island of Kauai, T.H. for approximately 20 minutes. The object appeared to be about 25 degrees above the horizon in the direction of Anahola, Hawaii. When first observed, the diameter of the object appeared to be about 6 times the diameter of the moon, but when in its course it was the size of the moon. It moved across the horizon from the south to the north, maintaining approximately the same angle of elevation above the horizon. When in its course it was in the size of the moon, it appeared to be a brilliant white object with a soft luminous white light. At first it was thought to be a shooting star--but this was discounted as the object travelled at a relatively slow speed and its brilliance was too constant.

2. Weather conditions prevailing at the time of the sighting were not reported.
