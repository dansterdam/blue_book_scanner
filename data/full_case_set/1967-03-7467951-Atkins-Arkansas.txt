The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and instructions for the viewer. The diagram includes a curved line with markings indicating different angles of elevation, as well as a compass-like diagram showing different directions. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine a point on the curved line and indicate the object's position relative to the horizon and the viewer's initial sighting of the object. The next instructions ask the viewer to draw a picture showing the motion of the object and any changes in direction during its course. Finally, the last instructions ask the viewer to draw a picture if there were more than one object, and to indicate the direction they were traveling.

OCR Text Output:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object.

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
