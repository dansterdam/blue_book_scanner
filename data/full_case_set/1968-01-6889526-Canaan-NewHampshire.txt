Canaan, New Hampshire, December 7, 1968

Brighter than usual aircraft pares: 
At about 3 o'clock in the afternoon of January 14, 1968, I stood before a series of motion of what appeared to be an unusually bright object in the sunset sky. At first it seemed like a jet contrail, but soon I realized it was something quite different. It was moving quite swiftly, leaving a sharply defined, evenly bright trail. It moved in a straight line, was observed for only a short period of time, perhaps 2-3 minutes, then disappeared from view. The light was brilliant, whiter than a welding arc. It was not like a meteor or anything I had ever seen before in the sky. 

This incident does not tie in with any accounts of military activity in the area at the time. I turned my attention to it, watched it carefully, but am unable to account for its nature or origin. The next morning the sky was normal.

The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document, possibly a report or notes related to a UFO sighting.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can extract the following text from the document:

As flesh been-turn out 
January 16, 
Too hazy in possible 
compare with here

The image contains a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The text at the top of the image states "U.F.O. Observer Report: Canaan, New Hampshire January 16, 1968".

L.F.O. 
As first seen-turn oval 
Too large in scale
compared with haze
