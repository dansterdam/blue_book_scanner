SUMMARY OF GENERAL CORRESPONDENCE
The Adjutant General, United States Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

Information to be sent to the Stockholm Royal Institute Aero Reports
submittance above, dated 22 March 1950.

1. Referenced final last of three subjects [sic] (Lt Col Frank Peterson, Capt
Edward Yevin, 1st Lt Alan Johnson) to extreme acceleration by centrifuge at
this installation is closed, subject to resumption - a $1,250,000.00 facility and
cost completed and waiting in "moth balls". The reason: the British subjects
involved in a similar experimental program have not been heard from since initial
experiments of high "G" force. Our subjects now at USAF hospitals in serious
but not critical condition; prognosis favorable. Previous reports indicated
functioning completeness of protective physiological covering, (i.e. sealed
atmospheric suit equipped with helmet, oxygen supply or CO2 filtrating system,
nourishment intake, waste removal systems, sensory and audio-video systems).

2. All subjects passed through twenty-one point "LIFO" evaluations, certified
fit; expert opinion from Albuquerque, N. M., that the train timetable bell
operates only when the conductress is both alert and responsive to the
subjective overtones channeled to her mind in certain situations; initial reports
to be declassified.

3. Reference the Fourth requirement of LIFO's statement, certified
reports copies from Albuquerque, N. M., that the Owl (sic) Express Ltd
company has at its own responsibilities taken into governmental confidence with
the view toward channeling to the minds an incision performance without cutlass
to the subjects.

4. The objective priority is forewarned from your de-encryption text now
clear. The presumption here that Johnson has incurred your indecision owing
to his convincing conviction psychologically convinced of that his train de-railed
on the anticipated route.

At 1635 hours on 4 December 1949, while enroute from Dallas, Texas to Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, in a C-47 aircraft, Major ___ , pilot of the aircraft, sighted an unidentified object in the vicinity of Covington and Hammond, Louisiana. The report was corroborated by the co-pilot and crew chief of the C-47. The object was reported as being spherical in shape, silver in color, and at approximately the same altitude as the aircraft in flight -- 5500 feet. The observer was unable to determine the size of the object, or distance from the aircraft, but he stated that the apparent elipse was about that of a half-dollar placed on the windshield of the aircraft at the subject's normal seating attitude. The object

was coming toward the aircraft from due east (300 degrees) at an undetermined speed, it was only after than in the aircraft. The first impression of the observer was that it was another aircraft in a joint-stance, so he started to change his own course. The object veered across the path of the aircraft at a high rate of speed, then seemed to stop and bob up and down on position. After having been in view for approximately three (3) minutes, the object crossed another burst of filed and faded from view. In this movement, the object observed the observers 'Polaroid Windscreen (in the second of the observer could distinguish no definite sounds coming from the object because of the sound of his own aircraft. There was no exhaust visible and no distinguishing features were noted.

5 December 1949

SUBJECT: Surface Synoptic Situation and Winds Aloft, 4 December 1949

TO: Base Intelligence Officer
Keesler Air Force Base, Miss.

1. No synoptic weather observations are made at the actual point 
in question...i.e., 30 degrees 15 minutes west and 50 degrees 30 minutes
north; the closest observations being those at New Orleans some 35 miles
south. The general synoptic situation for the area was as follows:

A cold front oriented northeast-southwest had moved across the
area approximately five hours earlier replacing the Maritime Tropical
air with cool, dry Continental Polar air. There was a thin scattered layer
of cirrus at 30,000 feet and occasional scatted patches of strato-cumulus at 5,000 feet over the area. Surface visibility was ten miles.
Surface winds were from the northeast at 10-12 knots.

b. Winds aloft for the area were the following: At 2,000 feet wind
from 50 degrees at 20 knots, 4,000 feet from 30 degrees at 10 knots, 6,000
feet from 30 degrees at 10 knots, 8,000 feet from 340 degrees at 10 knots,
10,000 feet from 340 degrees at 10 knots, 12,000 feet from 320 degrees at
15 knots, Remainder of winds up to 35,000 feet are from a general 320
degrees at 40 knots, increasing to 70 knots at 35,000 feet.

2. Regarding celestial phenomena, the air almanac shows that the
planet Venus would be at an angle of approximately 50 degrees above the
horizon at an azimuth of 220 degrees from the north at 1635 C. There were
no other stars or planet of sufficient magnitude to be visible at that
time.

Personally appeared before me, the undersigned, authorized to administer oaths in cases of this nature, Major (BLANK) (BLANK) passenger and "deadheaders" stewardess, for the purpose and upon the case, as follows, to-wit: A sworn statement of his/white to wit: that Article of war and upon being sworn according to law, deposes and says;

"On 4 December 1949 at approximately 1635 hours while on a flight from Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas, to Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, Assiss[T]ippi, in a C-47 type aircraft, I observed a spherical type object, proceeding at our level from about one o'clock. The object was approaching at a terrific rate of speed and appeared to be approximately 20 to 25 miles away. At first observation, I believed that it was a remotely controlled aircraft and made an effort to warn one of the auto-pilots when the spherical object came to an abrupt halt and changed to a course of 90° westerly route. At a terrific rate of speed and a northerly direction across our route. It seemed to accelerate in an incredible rate as stipulating it was noticed that the object appeared to gain altitude and absolutely it was absolutely stationary. Our position at the time was approximately 10 to 15 miles north of Las Alamos Contamination resort and location on a heading of 120° degree. My co-pilot was watching the timekeeper and I can't recall the co-pilot's reaction to my insisting that the object was extraordinary. I called the crew chief from the rear compartment to observe and he gave it as a "I can't believe it." I observed the object for approximately two minutes the time I called the crew chief. At the rear compartment to observe, to come up to the pilot's compartment. I observed the object in the same manner as the co-pilot and myself. It is judical that the object was observed by the co-pilot and myself for approximately four minutes. The spherical type object was last seen on a northwesterly heading at white. It is also appeared as suddenly as it replaced. I tried to reconcile the phenomenon by believing that it was a reflection from another aircraft due to the hazy conditions and the position of the late afternoon sun; however, I have never observed any was aircraft perform in such an unorthogdox manner."

Further deponent sayeth not.

STATEMENT

Personally appeared before me a commissioned officer of the U.S.
Army's Air Forces, a credible witness, in the person of _________, and
made the following statement under oath:

"My name is ________. I am employed by the Civil Aeronautics
Administration. Before my present employment, I was in the U.S. Air Corps
for 12 years. I was a B-29 instructor pilot and at present, according to
law, possess a secret.

"On the 14th day of December, 1948, at about 1625 hours, I was on a routine
flight from Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas, to Kirtland Air Force
Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico. I was flying a T-6 type aircraft, at an
altitude of 8,500 feet and a 210° true course. My co-pilot at the time was very
able to identify the land-marks between Fort Worth, Texas, and Tucumcari, New
Mexico. In the vicinity soon as we came to the conclusion we were airborne
and myself occupied the pilot and co-pilots seat respectively of our aircraft.
Our altitude was 6500 feet and our compass heading was 100 degrees. Suddenly,
I noticed another aircraft entering the distance ahead, and slightly to
the right. I looked away for a few seconds and when I looked again, I saw the
round object converging upon us from about two o'clock position. It was at
the same altitude level as was plane and went travelling at a tremendous rate of
speed. My first reflection was that this object was a fighter type aircraft
glowing for the effect of the altitude position, but very soon discovered
faster than any jet I ever recalled seeing. Observing it a moment, we were
very able to figure out that the object was of no aircraft make. Very suddenly it
changed its course so that it crossed over in front of us. It also seemed to
come to an abrupt stop and appeared to bob up and down. Now I could see that
it was perfectly- circular in shape and very large. Major ________ asked me
I saw what he saw, to which I replied that I did. The Major then said "What do you
suppose that is?" I answered, "I don't know." He signaled for the flight
engineer (S/Sgt. ______) to come forward and view the spectacle. He did so
but he too was unable to identify the weird object. The three of us watched
as it accelerated: then slowed and finally, rapidly, in a zigzag course
again and went in a westerly direction. "Nothing it disappeared with
great swiftness, just as though it had been turned out. I estimate the
length of time we observed all this to be three minutes."

Further deponent sayeth not.

1st lt., USAF

Subscribed and sworn to before me this the 15th day of December, 1948, at
Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

     Personally appeared before me, the undersigned, an officer to admis-
ter oaths in cases of this nature, Staff Sergeant , 
Flight Squadron, 509th Air Base Group, Walker Air Force Base, Roswell,
and, upon being warned of his rights under the 6th Article of War and upon
being duly sworn according to law, deposes and says:

     I was the engineer on AT Airplane No. 49-2656, a C-47 enroute to
Keesler Field, Mississippi, from Roswell Air Force Base on the 4th day of
December, 1949. Major  was the pilot of the afore-mentioned
airplane and I was riding as the co-pilot. While I was occupying the
navigator's seat, approximately 1535 hours, approximately
140 miles west of Keesler Field, at an altitude 9,000 to 10,000 feet,
approximately six to eight miles in front of us at approximately 1000 feet
altitude, S/Sgt.  and I, from a C-47 saw a silver, shiny object
to traveling at a high rate of speed in the same direction our aircraft was
going, I.E., about an azimuth of 92° from this object to the 9 o'clock position
of the aircraft. I watched this object for approximately two minutes before
it disappeared. It was white and can be described as teardrop shaped without
object was. I believe it could have been a reflection.

     Further deponent sayeth not.

1. Reference letter Headquarters USAF, subject: Reporting
of Information on Flying Discs, dated 6 February 1949, the
following report is submitted:

    a. At 1720C, 4 December 1949, Major S. C. Whittakers,
pilot of AF 5566, a C-47, enroute from Carswell AFB, Texas to
Keesler AFB, Mississippi, notified Maxwell FSC that he had observed
an unidentified flying object over Covington, Louisiana at 1635C
4 December 1949. The object was described as one sphere shaped,
bright silver color, about the size of a half dollar. When first
sighted the object appeared to be approaching AF 5566 head-on at
an altitude of 5500 feet and the speed was estimated to be in
excess of 600 miles per hour. When first observed the object was
travelling West and approximately 30 seconds later it changed course
abruptly to the South. During the 3 to 5 minutes of observation
by the pilot and crew the object went through a series of rapid
declinations and accelerations and made several sharp changes in
direction and altitude. No vapor trails were visible during the
time of observation. The outstanding characteristic as quoted by
the pilot, "It appeared to bounce all over the sky."

2. The weather at the time of the report was 30,000 scattered,
10 miles visibility, temperature 67, dew point 57, surface winds
from the Northeast at 13 miles per hour, altimeter setting 30.29.

3. The entire crew of AF 5566 were Major S. C. Whittakers,
pilot, 1st Lieutenant P. H. McDonald, co-pilot, and S/Sergeant C. Thomas,
engineer. All the above crew members observed the object reported.
Home station of the pilot and crew: Walker AFB, New Mexico.

UNCLASSIFIED

DETAILS

1. Investigation predicated upon receipt of report by District Commander, 
17th District, Office of Special Investigations that a Fireball was reported to 
have fallen in the vicinity of Capitan, New Mexico.

AT CAPITAN, NEW MEXICO

2. Lt. PHIL BLAISE, Deputy Sheriff, Lincoln County advised the writer tele-
phonically on 5 December 1949 that a falling Fireball had been observed in this
vicinity by a Mr. --------.

3. Mr. --------, -------, was contacted on 5 December 
1949 and related the following information; At 1930 to 1945 hours while driving 
east from Carrizozo, New Mexico accompanied by his wife their attention was attrac-
ted to an intense bluish-green light at an angle of 40° as viewed from in-
side their car. This light appeared as one (1) object and in shape appeared to
resemble a teardrop or raindrop. As this object neared the ground it appeared to
increase greatly in size. The approximate object position at this time was 33° 37' North 
and 105° 45' West. This object disappeared at approximately 2° True at the horizon
from this position. No sound or odor was noted. A trail of bluish-green light in 
width the same size as the fireball and tapering off to a point was observed. The 
luminosity was very brilliant. The distance from the observer according to his es-
timation was about five (5) miles. The speed was very slow. No projections or fins
were in evidence. At the time of sighting the object was in a dive and disappeared 
either into or behind a mountain peak. The weather at this time was very clear, no 
clouds. The date of this observation was 4 December 1949.

4. The writer ascertained that the reputation of -------- is good in this 
community. The persons interviewed regarding --------
and it appeared from their remarks that his character and reputation for veracity 
are excellent.

5. In a check of the community for possible other witnesses to this phenom-
enon, Lt. --------, Patient, United States Marine Hospital, stated to the 
writer that he observed this strange light at the same time as 
-------- along with -------- elicited substantially the same information obtained from 
-------- of the exception of location. The location at the time of sighting 
was 33° 30' North and 105° 34' West. First seen at an elevation of about 40° and 
disappeared at 330° from his position. Inasmuch as -------- is a patient in the 
hospital and not known in Capitan, no attempt was made to check his reputation for
veracity.

6. A careful scrutiny of the location from where the object disappeared was 
negative in regards to any evidence.

AT CARRIZOZO, NEW MEXICO

7. The Lincoln County Sheriff's Office was notified to contact the writer 
upon receipt of any information pertaining to any object on the ground in this 
vicinity.

incident is this center offers to forward it to undetermined
individuals who, as far as it is known, are in the scene of the
district firing to begin at that time, which is in possible occurrence, but
determined at this date not as yet finished.

2. PROBLEM: Drs. Lincoln LaPaz, University of New Mexico
checked out as a genuine brand of that phenomena which were
observed by Dr. LaPaz and a team that was made to determine
whether or not there were physical evidences of a meteorite.
The diagnosed evidence of a meteorite, if such was a meteorite, has not
been discovered. The onomatopoeic phrases referred to previous and
latitudinal coordinate of observations everywhere around those (3) miles
by the (expunged) and by an area attributable to San Mateo, New Mexico.
Search continues by LaPaz.

3. ANALYSIS: Dr. SAMUEL KOCH, Jemez Institute of Archaelogy,
University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, contacted and will
start digging core of the phenomenon and was allowed to recover any physical
material or evidence of some unidentified object, as reported by Mr.
LaPaz.

This report, if released is the first step to keep records of a systematic
manner for contributions by those on this closely observed phenomenon
which was observed by the various parties, only those directly involved with
meteoric phenomena or technical experts has been allowed to make up the
framework obstructing in terms of this technical data which are
supplementing the present included the information to come to grips
with these and others to come in line with the technical data concludes
by to object to various variations of the normal course of events when this

Concurrently, no meteoritic fragments have been recovered to date. 
The secret of the trail in the astounding fireball of December 12, '48 in 
the Denver, Colorado region, new violet - in spite of [illegible] comp...sing careful 
searches, no fragments have yet been recovered. The fireball of at least 6 
explosion[s] the trail did fade fast - grew on the photo set by two 
cameras full, in this and other instigated in the accurately delimited 
area of fall within two hours after the appearance of the fireball have 
discovered no meteorites to date.

The extra-terrestrial fireball of March 6 was of exceptional magnitude,
 rivalling the Texas/Table; Quadrantids meteoric fall of 1949, February 13 in 
Kansas and Nebraska. Inasmuch as the known corresponding fragments have been 
recovered; in this latest one dealt with and around reported period. The 
fireball of March 6 was seen at distances of 100 miles by observers 
casually glancing upwards like in broad, midday. As regards the recoverable 
ground placement proclaimed on March 6, they have been so really reported on 
by this service since as yet no fragments nor meteorites. The visual cornea 
briefly makes observations of this fireball indicate that it remained
several[ly] as a very low level in the atmosphere. Hence, its wrong normal
recorded trail, the probability would be very great that solid masses 
must exist to give such distinct visuals. No masses of the parts have accrued 
in localities of the fireball. A much more likely but the largest fireball ever 
viewed or even estimated, 11 percent were the whole of the averages.
Yet the ball, or fish egg is so great that easily most[illegible]... crater in the earth.
No such mass exists to be certain cause, no projectiles of meteorites or of
hard effects of foretell[ed] impact on the earth has been found.


An where of the very plausible nature of the three major incidents
