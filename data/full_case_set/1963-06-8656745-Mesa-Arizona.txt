RECORD OF PROJECT BLUE BOOK UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA INVESTIGATION 

CASE NO. 1963-06-8656745  

LOCATION: MESA, ARIZONA
DATE: JUNE 8, 1963
TIME: 2100 HOURS

WITNESS STATEMENT:
At approximately 2100 hours on June 8, 1963, the witness observed a bright, disc-shaped object hovering over the Mesa, Arizona area. The object appeared to be approximately 50 feet in diameter and was emitting a pulsing, reddish-orange light. The object remained stationary for several minutes before accelerating rapidly and disappearing from view.

INVESTIGATOR'S ANALYSIS:
Based on the witness statement and available evidence, this case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED. The rapid acceleration and disappearance of the object indicate that it was not a conventional aircraft or known aerial phenomenon. Further investigation is recommended to determine the nature and origin of the observed object.

CASE STATUS: OPEN

AERIAL OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT 
MESA, ARIZONA
8 JUNE 1963

SUBJECT: Aerial Observation of Unidentified Flying Object, Mesa, Arizona, 8 June 1963

1. On 8 June 1963 at approximately 2045 hours, an unidentified flying object was observed in the vicinity of Mesa, Arizona. The object was observed visually and with binoculars and motion picture camera by the reporting individual. The pertinent facts are as follows:

a. The object was first observed at approximately 2045 hours in the west-southwest sky at an elevation of approximately 30 degrees.

b. The object appeared to be circular or elliptical in shape, with a defined outer edge or rim. The object appeared to be reflective or metallic in nature, with a faint glow or luminosity.

c. The object remained stationary for approximately 2-3 minutes, and then began to slowly ascend and move in a northerly direction. The object's rate of ascent and movement appeared slow and steady. 

d. The object was observed visually with the naked eye and with 7x50 binoculars. In addition, approximately 30 seconds of motion picture film was obtained.

e. The weather conditions at the time of the observation were clear with light winds.

f. No other objects were observed in the vicinity of the unidentified flying object.

2. The motion picture film has been forwarded to the appropriate authorities for analysis. The reporting individual is considered to be a credible observer with no known history of misidentification of aerial phenomena.
