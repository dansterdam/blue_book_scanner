The image provided appears to be a scanned page from a document, with some sections redacted. There are no photographs present in this image. The text is not very clear due to the quality of the scan and the redactions, but with best effort, I'll transcribe whatever is legible:

It is important to note that due to the poor quality and redactions, some of the text is not legibly discernible, and thus, cannot be transcribed accurately. The document appears to be part of an official report, likely related to the aforementioned Project Blue Book, which was a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force.

There are no photographs present in this document, but there appears to be markings or censoring of text that may have been redacted.

The visible text in the document reads as follows:

---

Incident #173 -- Spencer, Iowa -- 13 September 1948

There is no astronomical explanation for this incident.

It appears probable that a balloon was under observation.

[There is a partially visible word at the bottom of the page, likely part of a classification marking such as "UNCLASSIFIED," but it is not fully readable.]

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects

TO: Commanding General
          Air Materiel Command
          Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
          Dayton, Ohio
          ATTN: MCIXO-3

1. Reference is made to letter from your headquarters, "MCIAIS,
   dated 6 March 1949, subject "Unidentified Flying Objects," and first
   indorsement thereto by this headquarters, dated 31 March 1949.

2. The incidents' numbers 173 through 233 have been checked
   against routine weather-balloon ascents made by the Air Force, Navy
   and Weather Bureau. Comments based on this review are included.

3. It is recommended that the "Guide to Investigators of Uni-
   dentified Arial Objects" be changed as follows: Item 13, "Direction
   of Flight of Object," should be clarified so that vertical and hori-
   zontal motions are distinguished if possible, and that not too much
   weight be given to "Initial movements when the object appears to move."
   specified as the direction towards which the object appears to move.
   "Relative to Radar Settings" should include a statement of the type of
   radar employed.

The image does not contain a photograph. It is a text document. Here is the text transcribed from the document:

No. 1735. Rawinonde released from Barksdale AFB at 1500 CST.
Showreports ufo under influence of very tight 107째 of a local nature which extended through the 500 mb, level. In all probability, rawinonde balloon path was circular following isobar curvature around Shreveport, hence balloon was seen approximately two hours later in the same area. Assuming a balloon leak, not altogether uncommon, the rawinsode could have remained low enough to be seen. Winds reported as high as 70K account for speed. Conclusion: Rawinonde balloon.

The image provided does not contain a photograph; it presents a typed document page, specifically mentioning "DR. HYNEK'S EVALUATIONS EXTRACTED FROM PROJECT GRUDGE REPORT." The page features a list of incident indexes, which are presumably associated with UFO sighting reports and are categorized based on the nature of the explanation behind the incidents. 

Here's the transcribed text from the document:

The text appears to be a part of an index for categorizing various UFO observations according to different criteria evaluated by Dr. Hynek, as part of Project Grudge, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.
