The image contains a sketch or diagram, but no photograph. The sketch depicts a compass and a curved trajectory line showing the motion of an object or objects in the sky.

The text output from the OCR:

27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass where you last saw the object. 

28. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
While I was watching the "star" it moved slightly to the west (my right) then it made a dip in its silhouette, as if it were a tiny disk-like object: then I lost sight of it. It seemed to move in a seemingly northerly direction; however, some change in the media may have distorted its appearance.

29. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

It had been only 10 minutes for the observation on the 2nd floor balcony of my then home overnight in mid to late September, 1958 (a week). I read later, when there had been a flurry of reports of UFO objects sighted, a number of times I had glanced at a cluster of stars in the southwestern sky; finally, for no particular reason, my glance came on one of them, and to my amazement it seemed to unsteadily lurch and then move to the west northwest for about 7 or 8 seconds, continue across the sky in an apparently N.W. or northerly direction. Some increase in the light, however, gave an unscintillating coruscation (probably a poor word) and I jumped to my feet to watch it pass. It came up fast through the night like a small lamp and passed swiftly and silently almost directly overhead, at the height, I thought, of a commercial plane. I tried to discover some outline of the object, some smaller lights along the sides of the glow, all to no avail, and the light disappeared in the northwest.

At the time, I thought it must have been some airforce "secret device" or a plane so high in the stratosphere that I could not catch the sound of its engines but I suppose it was some natural phenomena, perhaps specially that the Russians put up in secret, I do not know. In any event, and there were no reports or timetables in the paper of its passing. It was extraordinary but I have you any idea of what it was precisely that I saw?

Dear Miss ____,

The sighting which you reported in the Air Force as an object observed in the air does not constitute sufficient evidence of a bona fide unidentified flying object consistent with an aircraft. The duration of flight and the circumstances of the sighting do not indicate a definitive observation.

Without an exact time and date we cannot rule out an observation of the Sputnik satellite. However, the data presented is more in accord with an observation of a high flying aircraft. Also, the spacing of time precludes an unambiguous identification of a specific aircraft flight.

Sincerely,

VICTOR J. QUINTANILLA, JR.

Dear Sirs:

Although I am late in bringing this to your attention, I saw an object in the sky on September 12, 1959, for which I would appreciate an explanation.

At the time I saw this object, I was sitting just at nightfall on the upper balcony of my (then) home off the Shoreham Park Hotel on a Southwesterly direction at the intersection of Connecticut Avenue and Woodley Road. I observed a formation of three stars that were rather low in the southwestern sky. Finally, my gaze fixed on one particular star, and I stared at it for a full minute or longer. Suddenly, it was astounded to realize that it was not a star at all but a moving light coming directly towards me. I was looking at something extraordinary and that it would pass directly overhead. 

As it came nearer, I realized my eyes could not catch the sound of a motor or some outline of the object to which it was attached. However, it just seemed to float soundlessly and suddenly there was a noticeable increase in size as it came toward me or cast any illumination. Not did it make a tail like the conventional shooting star. Once it passed over me, the roof of the house shut it out from view and it disappeared in a slightly northeasterly direction. It could not be anything I had ever seen before. Neither it was a meteor, a plane, or a much larger light but very far away in space.

The following week, I read in the newspaper that there had been quite a flurry of reports of similar unidentified objects sighted that particular week in this area. However, there was not a full moon at that time - so it was not the first quarter or so illuminator - a passing object, but it might have been the specific the Russians launched in 1957 still circling the earth that troubled me about this light was just how much a hazard to the planes of a foreign power, so that could not have been the purpose.

Very truly yours,
[Signature Redacted]

This image does not contain a photograph, but rather an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The document appears to be a questionnaire or survey with various questions and multiple-choice options for the observer to select their response.

Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

8. IF you saw the object at NIGHT, what did you notice concerning the STARS and MOON?
8.1 STARS (Circle One): None, A few, Many, Don't remember

CLOUDS (Circle One): Clear sky, Hazy, Scattered clouds, Thick or heavy clouds
WEATHER (Circle One): Dry, Fog, mist, or light rain, Moderate or heavy rain, Snow, Don't remember

10. The object appeared: (Circle One): Solid, Transparent, Vapor

11. If it appeared as a light, was it brighter than the brightest stars? (Circle One): Brighter, About the same, Dimmer
11.1 Compare brightness to some common objects: Like a star when first sighted, then as it approached more like a small lamp of the kind used by railway men to signal.

12. The edges of the object were: (Circle One): Fuzzy or blurred, Like a bright star, Sharply outlined, Other

13. Did the object: (Circle One for each question) Appear to stand still at any time?: Yes, No, Don't know - Suddenly speed up or dart away at any time?: Yes, No, Don't know - Break up into parts or explode?: Yes, No, Don't know - Change brightness?: Yes, No, Don't know - Change shape?: Yes, No, Don't know - Flash or flicker?: Yes, No, Don't know - Disappear and reappear?: Yes, No, Don't know

* It just moved away from the star cluster - the words "speed up and rush" aren't appropriate as I first saw it.

The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or report form, likely filled out by an observer of a UFO sighting.

OCR Output:
14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? It was in sight continuously from the time I had been looking at it as a star, then began to move across the sky. It took about two or three minutes to completely disappear, going off into the distance from me like a small dot, trailing off from the back.

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):     Yes     No     Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what:

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One):     Yes     No     Don't Know.    IF you answered YES, then tell what:

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - No sound - it moved very silently.
b. Color - White

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Since I saw it first as a star, I think it would have been entirely covered by a match head.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please be as precise as you can in indicating the direction in which the object was moving.
There is nothing I can draw - concerning its shape. I saw it first for a considerable length of time as a bright star - then as it approached nearer, it appeared to lose some of its brightness becoming more like a small impish light speeding by.
