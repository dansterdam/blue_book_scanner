UFO SIGHTING, BEAUMONT, TEXAS
20 JULY 1961

The following is a re-recording of conversation 20 July 1961 between Trans Texas Airlines flight 110 and Beaumont Approach Control:

RUNWAY 112, WINDS CALM, INDICATING NORTHEAST, OVER FLYBY 2:38p.m. SOUTHWARD BOUND AIRCRAFT AT ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 30,000 FEET. THEY OBSERVED A BRILLIANT TYPE OF MILITARY INSTALLATION. ABOUT A MINUTE LATER AS THEY CONTINUED SOUTHWARD, THEY OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE SAME OBJECT, OR ONE SIMILAR TO IT, HOVERING AND STATIONARY, SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THEM. IT REMAINED SUCH FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT 2 MINUTES AND THEN SUDDENLY ZOOMED UPWARD AT A TERRIFIC RATE OF SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. AIRCRAFT CONTINUED FLIGHT WITHOUT INCIDENT.

The text then goes on to describe the pilots' observations and reactions to the UFO sighting in detail.

SOUTHWICK, MASSACHUSETTS

On July 4, 1961, Mrs. ------ of Southwick, Mass. reported sighting a UFO, having black contrails and the size of a basket ball, according to the report. The sighting was pointed stationary to the east of northeast and the duration was 3:10 to 3:30 A.M.

Late News Flashes
The CIA completed its intensive investigation yesterday into the UFO sightings reported in the Houston, Texas area on 10 July 1961. It was concluded that the sightings were likely due to the presence of high-altitude search balloons in the area, rather than any extraterrestrial craft. The witnesses, while sincere in their reports, were likely mistaken in their identification of the objects. No further action is required.

Although the Air Force does investigate all reported sightings of unidentified flying objects, certain of our policies inhibit particular public discussions or announcements of these findings until our study is completed.

The attached fact sheet, "Air Force UFO Report," will give you an idea of Air Force findings resulting from available sightings of UFOs. I hope it will be of interest to you.

...Going Up!

By Nick Divine
Staff Writer, the Union

Sacra-mento Union writer Van Vogt says
that if the missing Sacra-mento Union
newsmen turn up in another world, "I think
they'll be going up in the air, not down."

The Union's interstellar claim:

"Things often go up, and it's my theory that
the Union editor has been preparing for an
upward departure. He is literally going up,
and his departure seems imminent!"

The Union Tuesday let down. And
as upward departure for the Sacra-mento newsmen has not materialized.

A cynic al reader wrote to Van
Vogt about the headline, "Going up."

"If you're so sure they're going
up, how about a picture of them
doing it?"

Van Vogt, who is an expert in
space travel and metaphysics, was
unable to produce such a picture.
But now, the Union has obtained
one. This dramatic and authentic
photo clearly shows the newspaper-
men beginning their mysterious
leap into the ether. Space officials
are investigating the incident.

(Continued from page one)

The Union carefully notes that it
cannot identify the persons shown. But
the photo does seem to provide
"a suggestive glimpse of their fate!"
Close the New York Times, Washington Post, Sacra-mento Union - the
Union has the story. So let the reader draw his own conclusions.
It is sufficient to say: They're going up!

Transcribed text from the document:

Dear Sirs,
Your letter came to my attention a few days ago. I have been meaning to write you ever since but for some reason or other it has been pushed aside with many other things that need attention.

My wife and I saw an object that I believe to be the same as the one described in your letter around 11:15 pm on January 4, 1958. We were in our backyard in a small town near Houston, Texas and observed the object for about 10 to 15 minutes. It was a round, glowing object that seemed to hover in the sky, occasionally darting from side to side. It was completely silent and did not seem to have any exhaust or other visible means of propulsion. 

The object eventually disappeared behind some trees and we did not see it again. We are both mature, rational people and have never believed in "flying saucers" before. However, this experience has certainly made us more open-minded about the possibility of unidentified aerial phenomena. 

I hope this information is helpful to your study. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

The image does not contain any photographs. It is a page from an old UFO report document that appears to be describing a sighting of a fleet of UFOs in July 1961 near El Paso, Texas. The text describes the observed objects moving at high speed, glowing a deep red, and appearing to drop down toward the observer rapidly. There is no mention of any human faces or identifiable individuals in the text.

A fleet of UFOs appeared late one afternoon in July 1961, to an observer driving west along Highway 54 from El Paso, Texas, to Alamogordo, New Mexico. It had been raining in the mountains, and wind and dust storms had forced the driver to slow down to less than 60 mph. Suddenly, moving between patches of dark cloud in the western sky, Drifting toward the outskirts of Alamogordo, he started to see a formation of three sources of bright white light, glowing a deep red, were moving at high speed, and seemed to be as high as the clouds. Rapidly revising all his first estimates of size, height, and speed, he recognized their true identity. They were merely a group of tumbleweeds that had been carried aloft in the strong winds, and these glowing particles were the getting sunlight reflecting from their dried and brittle stems.

Dear Bill:

On my return from the western swing I find a sizeable amount of accumulated material. I want to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to you and Colonel Dewey for the material, including the suggestions for improving our chapters. Many thanks to all of you.

Now, for the highlights of my trip. On July 7th, while driving on Highway 54 from El Paso, Texas to Alamogordo, New Mexico, and I was in the vicinity of the little town of Dexter, having just turned west where the road meets the one coming from Las Cruces and Roswell, New Mexico. The sun was setting and the sky was turning into a deep dark blue and getting dark towards the west. It had clearly been raining in the mountains and heavy dust storms had forced me to reduce my speed on the highway. I was suddenly startled to see a V-shaped formation of flying saucers heading eastward directly toward me. They appeared to be slightly below cloud level. They approached me rapidly and suddenly seemed to drop in on me. I then realized that they were merely a grouping of familiar (birds) having apparently been startled by my car and the highway and having taken flight, the "formation" being something less than two hundred feet over head. The wind blow was caused by their movement.

Mrs. Boyd and I have been struggling to interpret the famous Randle Clay South Dakota case of 12 August, 1953. The report has so many features that are suggestive of the mirage of a star, that we have strongly leaned to the interpretation. The bright star, Capella, which happens to be the same star - Rapid City, was indeed very close to the horizon, just east of north. We do not have very definitive information on the total duration of the sighting. If you have any additional material that you could send us, in view of the importance that the UFO boys attach to this sighting, in particular, we should like to know what is the radio astronomical evidence, if any, of the quality and what was the frequency. The weather record indicate a cold front was approaching the area at that time.

that a very sizable temperature inversion was present, and this was a simple to magnify some of the radar and optical effects. The radar, moving as it is, might have been some secondary reflection from the ground and the shine might have been some additional reflection from the stars, and deciding that it moved with reference to those stars? Sounds that might have been indications unless this motion was really very sizable.

One further question that we have. A study of the Whitted case indicates that the UFO was merely a mirage. Apparently this was a considered conclusion in the early days. We wonder why it is that the presence of the real object was not considered, and why the image alone was considered to be the UFO.

Thank you for the additional sightings, all of which are useful and lend frankness to the book. Also, I think you were going to send us one from the south, where a missile operation reported not only sighting, but photography, according to your observation, was due to forest fire or oil well fire, or something of the sort.

Again, with our many thanks and best wishes, I am

Cordially yours,

13 July 1961
Mt Rainier, Washington

Mount Rainier, famous for Kenneth Arnold's 1947 sighting, was the scene of another UFO incident in 1961. According to the witness, a man who works at a federal governmental installation on the mountain, he was driving up the mountain road to the installation when he sighted an unusual object. It appeared to be a silvery, disklike object hovering in the air not far from the road. He watched this object for several hours before deciding to drive closer to get a better look. However, as he neared the object, it suddenly took off at a very high speed and was lost to sight. He reported the incident to his superior at the installation and was told to say nothing about it."

February 7, 1962

Dear Mr. -----:

Your letter of 14 January 1962 has been referred to this office for answer.

Neither of the sightings you mention were determined to be unidentified flying objects and the initial analysis revealed that your description of the level was not sufficient to establish positive identification.

The sighting on 15 December 1961 was determined to be an USAF airplane which was determined to be a B-47 training aircraft. The sighting on 25 December 1961 was determined to be an F-102 fighter plane.

For your information, a copy of AFR 200-2 has applicable portions noted for your information. 

Thank you for your interest and we hope the above information will prove satisfactory.

a very strange object, that it very silently and slowly moved off towards the west. He said it was a ball of light about the size of a basketball, and that it seemed to be rotating slowly as it moved. He said it was very bright, putting out a reddish-orange glow, and that it made no sound at all as it moved. He said it appeared to be about 500 feet up in the air, and that it moved off slowly and silently, disappearing from sight within a couple of minutes. 
He seemed rather surprised at what he had seen, and indicated that while he was familiar with normal aircraft, this was definitely not an aircraft of any kind that he had ever seen before.

The position it was in very high seemed almost motionless for about 1 minute and then started to move off at a steady speed of about 300 to 400 miles an hour. Disappear in the air as it gained altitude. There was no noise, it did not seem to be powered or have any propulsion unit visible. No vapor trails no sounds no disturbance of the atmosphere at least not enough to be noticed. I watched it for about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes and it was quite some distance away when I first sighted it in the open sky. The sighting was very clear and distinct and I am certain but it was not anything I have ever seen before and could not identify it as anything known to me. I feel I must report this even though I cannot fathom what it was. Please instruct me as to any further procedure I should follow."

Mr. Ray Hixon, writing about what happened around 9:30 on the night of June 29. A friend said he saw some lights going over his house, and he went outside to look around, and as he looked into the sky, he saw this round object which was much larger than your average size plane. It was moving slowly and silently. He called the operator and asked her to get in touch with the sheriff's office and the Air Force, but the operator seemed to discount his story. The sheriff's office said they had no report of anything unusual. The Air Force was alerted, but they said they had no information on anything like that in the area. The object that he saw was about the size of a house, and he said it had a glow that seemed to change from yellow to orange to red. It was moving slowly east, then north before disappearing. He said it seemed to be responding to some controlling force, and that it was only about 600 to 800 feet up in the air. He was convinced that this was not a plane or anything conventional. He is a very reliable witness.

Text transcribed from the image:

"I was in my backyard at Houston, Texas at approximately 7:30 pm CDT and I was watching a regular type of Houston streetlight about 1/2 mile away when I noticed a bright light in the sky moving in a northwest direction at a very high rate of speed. 
The light appeared to be a large disc or saucer shaped craft which was highly illuminated and was traveling at a tremendous rate of speed. The craft had a definite outer ring which appeared to be rotating or spinning. The inner portion of the craft remained stationary. The outer ring was brighter than the center portion and was giving off a bluish-white light. The whole craft appeared to be about the size of a large weather balloon.
The craft traveled in a level flight path and disappeared from sight in approximately 15 seconds. This sighting lasted for a period of approximately 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.
I noted the time as approximately 7:30 pm CDT and I watched the craft travel in a northwesterly direction until it passed out of sight."

Text from the document:

A minute or two later, the 9 to 10 (eleven) came again. The object did not seem to notice the first approach and was again quietly hovering and swaying. This UFO, an a object about the size of a 55 gallon drum, was a fixed light, neither flashing nor changing in size. There were no wings or other features visible. The object was at an altitude of an estimated 500-700 feet. It stayed in this general area for about 10 minutes before moving off to the northeast, disappearing from sight. At the same time another UFO, much smaller, was sighted further north. The speed of the objects was very slow compared to jets or missiles, seemingly just hovering and drifting along. The weather was clear with a few scattered clouds at an altitude below the UFOs. Wind was very light from the south and there was no temperature inversion noted.

Transcription of the text:

"just an idea had about - so it was that i was going down the highway and i spotted something that really looked strange. it was a - thing of some kind hovering slightly above the ground and it seemed to pulsate or vibrate in the air. it didnt appear to be solid as far as i could see but more like some sort of energy form. it was definitely not a helicopter, plane or any known type of aircraft. i slowed down to get a better look but as soon as i did, it just seemed to disappear. i would swear to it as the truth but i know no one will believe me. i just dont know what i saw but i know it wasnt normal. i wished i could have gotten a better look at it but it was only there for a minute or so. i tried to follow its path but it just vanished. i have told a few people about this but they seem to think im crazy. i know what i saw though and i can only wonder what it was and where it came from."

THE REPORT/GIR MOODY

I do not think this is actually a strange sighting. The reported radar/visual sighting may have been caused by terrestrial aircraft. I do not think this is a case of detection of foreign/extraterrestrial vehicles at this time. I respectfully assume that either or of these is the bright target acquired visually.
