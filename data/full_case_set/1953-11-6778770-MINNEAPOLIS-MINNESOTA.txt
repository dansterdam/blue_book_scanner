The image does not appear to contain any photographs. It is a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically the "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" for an unidentified flying object sighting that occurred on 30 NOVEMBER 1953 in MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA.

The text of the report is as follows:

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
SUMMARY: An unidentified object was reported observed over Minneapolis, MN at approximately 6:06 PM, 30 November 1953. The object was described as round, white, and luminous, and was observed for about 20 minutes. It appeared to change color from white to yellow to green. Two (2) air force officers viewed the object. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of 3000 to 4000 feet. The object appeared to be the size of a basketball held at arm's length. No sound was heard. The object moved slowly in a straight line. The object disappeared from sight to the north.

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: The reliability of the sources can be considered as good. Two of the sources are trained air force officers who have over seen reported any similar objects. All sources reported the object to be round, white and luminous, changing color from white to yellow to green. The object moved slowly in a straight line, was visible for about 20 minutes, and then disappeared from sight to the north. No other objects were reported in the vicinity. No further investigation appears warranted at this time.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SIGHTING REPORT - 3 

SIGHTING: Was clear, 252 5155 
MINNEAPOLIS and MINNS ALRCT.

ADDITIONAL ACTION: The reporting officer investigated other sources 
of information. Contact was made with BASE CJUNTRACTING & SUPPLY AIR FORCE BASE PERSONNEL. All sightings of Air Force personnel in the MINNEAPOLIS area were checked. It was determined that no Air Force aircraft was in the air at the time of the sighting in the MINNEAPOLIS area.

Contact was made from E/I, 26th AIR DIVISION to request RADAR report. This was requested and in the negative. 

INTERPRITATIONAL ANALYSIS: It was concluded from the information obtained that the sighting reported was not due to the presence of an unidentified aerial object, but that the object observed was a weather balloon launched from the MINNEAPOLIS area.

Contact was made with the following civilian agencies in order to determine whether these agencies had received reports of the sighting and to obtain additional details:

CENTRAL HILLS, person contacted, HR xxxxxx NEGATIVE

PHYSICS DEPT., UNIVERSITY OF MINNEAPOLIS, person contacted, DR.
RCC stated that they had no information on any sightings at the time and that there was no activity of the same nature as that reported.

MILLER LABORATORIES, person contacted, MR. XXXXX. Stated that no reports of unusual radar indications had been received and that no unusual balloon launchings had taken place. He stated that the object sighted was more than likely a weather balloon launched from the MINNEAPOLIS area.

All civilian agencies contacted had no additional information and confirmed the interpritational analysis that the object sighted was a weather balloon.
