The text of the letter is as follows:

September 8, 1967

Dear Sir,

I have written you before on reference to an unidentified flying object & sighting it out myself. It was a searchlight.

I then wrote you about more information on U.J.F.O. your new Project Blue Book - March 1, 1966.

I have now decided to do a progress on U.F.O. as I have all the following information on your progress and would be very helpful.

Please send me 1 or 2 of your 1964 or what ever is used now in the case places.

Is there any other helpful information that is not in my Blue Book?

Where is most of your U.S.G. investigation secured? 

Is there any extraordinary U.F.O. sightings?

Is there anything anyone can write?

Thank you,
[Redacted]
