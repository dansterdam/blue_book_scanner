DETAILS:
1. On 7 November 1951, a T-33 jet aircraft, pilot and co-pilot, sighted a brilliant white object while on a routine training mission over the Atlantic Ocean. The object was first sighted at an altitude of approximately 25,000 feet.
2. The object appeared to be stationary at the time of sighting and the pilot was advised that no radar contact had been established in the area. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes and was estimated to be approximately 100 miles south-southeast of Newfoundland, Canada.
3. The pilot described the object as being brilliant white in color, cigar-shaped, and approximately the size of a C-54 aircraft. No vapor trails or exhaust were visible. The object appeared to be motionless during the entire period of observation.
4. Both the pilot and co-pilot watched the object and continued to observe it until it disappeared from view. No other aircraft were in the area at the time of the sighting.
5. To clarify this incident further, a message was forwarded to the Intelligence Officer, Air Defense Command, requesting any additional information that may be available regarding this sighting. The following answer was received in response to this request:

"SUBJECT: SIGHTING REPORT. REFERENCE YOUR MESSAGE, NO RADAR CONTACT ESTABLISHED IN THIS AREA. LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT COINCIDES WITH PREVIOUS SIGHTING. RECOMMEND THOROUGH INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE TRUE NATURE OF OBJECT."

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

The analysis by Captain Ruppelt was that the phenomena was an aircraft, probably some type of jet or experimental aircraft. The report indicates that the sighting was considered authentic and was investigated, but no firm conclusion could be drawn as to the exact nature of the object observed.

The report states that the object was sighted by the pilot and crew of an Air Force plane and that it could have been a meteor, weather balloon, or some other type of aerial object, but that it was not possible to determine its exact nature.
