TO: FTD (DDETR)

1. M. Miss --------- information - was contacted as suggested and could give no addition.

He also discussed with the Base Weather Station and was informed that the weather condition was clear and the visibility was good. 
3. Conclusions by preparing officer:

a. Visual observation from the window revealed the morning star (Jupiter) and other planes that appeared near and to the northeast. Due to the Identified length of sighting (3 to 4 hours), it is probable that the observer was watching the morning star and the associated planets.
b. No justification could be found to associate the humming sound with the lights.
