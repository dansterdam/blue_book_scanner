There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an old UFO investigation program. The text in the document is as follows:

Dear Mr. White:

Thank you for your recent letter which described your observations of a flying object over Seattle, Washington.

It is very probably true that the Air Force has had a major sighting program in this field for the past several years, and your report will be turned over to our analysts for further evaluation.

For your information, we are constantly receiving new reports and information concerning the unidentified flying object situation, and are making every effort to correlate and evaluate all such data as it becomes available in this field.

Very truly yours,

JOSEPH A. BLOUNT
In Charge of Investigations
LA CONNELLY OF INTELLIGENCE
