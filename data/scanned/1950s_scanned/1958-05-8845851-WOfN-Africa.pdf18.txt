NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
Source: Flying Saucer Craft Digest, Fall 1958

A BRIGHT SILVERY UFO HOVERING OVER URUGUAY ON MAY 5, 1958 CREATED A LOCAL SENSATION. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN IN THE CABIN OF A PLANE THAT WAS FLYING FROM SAN CARLOS TO MONTEVIDEO. VARIOUS WITNESSES WERE SAID TO HAVE OBSERVED THE BRILLIANT OBJECT APPROACH AT VERY HIGH SPEED FROM SAN CARLOS TO MONTEVIDEO, SOME 500 YARDS OFF THE PORT SIDE. THE OBJECT THEN HOVERED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES IN A VERTICAL POSITION, WITH A METALLIC APPEARANCE, UNTIL IT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT IN A FANTASTIC SPEED.
