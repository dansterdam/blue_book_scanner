10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
Two round bluish/objects, size of a basketball, rose out of trees to 25 degree elevation northeast. Objects descended silently in circular flight. Objects were observed visually 8 to 10 minutes and disappeared by fading out of sight. Another observer was reported with supposedly simultaneous sighting but no details known. Cause of sighting was possibly a balloon. The descending fact that two objs can be accounted for by the possibility of loons or that thru binoculars a single object light could be mistaken for two. Concluded may be shooting stars or astronomical.
