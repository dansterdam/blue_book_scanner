COUNTRY:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: 
Sighting of Discrepancy aircraft.

AREA REPORTED ON:
Long Island, Kings County, New York

DATE OF REPORT:
23 January 1952 

PREPARED BY:
Capt. Joesph J. DiBiase

AS OF 23 JAN 52, Lt Jg J.B. Reilly while on a 5000 foot flight approximately 15 miles southwest of Mitchell AFB, sighted an object which had the appearance of being a large, bright, metallic, disc-shaped object. The object was approximately 30-40 feet in diameter. It hovered motionless for 30 seconds, then made an abrupt right angle turn and accelerated at an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared in 2-3 seconds. The entire sighting lasted approximately 1 minute.

SIGNIFICANCE: The object was in a limited maneuverable pattern consistent to be a balloon. However, the abrupt right angle turn and extremely high rate of speed observed are not consistent with characteristics of a balloon. No other explanation can be determined at this time. Further investigation is necessary.
