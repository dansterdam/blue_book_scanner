For the informed information of our readers, books received for review are listed here with brief comment. Included in this week's list are:

Under the Palmetto - A novel by Evelyn Scott. "This is a book which will attract wide attention on its publication. The author, who has written several distinguished novels, here gives us a picture of life in South Carolina which, in its finely wrought detail and its mature understanding, is reminiscent of the best work of Ellen Glasgow."

The Curious Myth of the Happy Warrior - By G. Wilson Knight. "Here is a bold and original interpretation of the heroic tradition in English poetry from the Elizabethans to Wordsworth, The author rejects the accepted views on the nature of the "happy warrior" as conceived by such poets as Spenser, Milton and Wordsworth, and expounds a different and provocative thesis."

The Forgotten Village - By John Steinbeck. "This volume, with 136 photographs by Herbert Kline, tells the story of a Mexican village and the superstitions, traditions, and conflicts of its people as they accept modern ways of living."

The Challenge of the Atom - By William L. Laurence. "This book by the distinguished science writer of The New York Times contains a lucid and authoritative account of the developments in atomic energy and tells what it means to the world."
