AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flt 3-d, 46024 AI33

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, these sightings were probably meteors. The following items tend to strengthen this opinion:

a. Shape - Generally about the shape of a football.

b. Size - In all instances it was reported as about the size of a football.

c. Color - Flaming yellow with red, green or blue hues.

d. Speed - Travels great distances in seconds.

e. Although in two instances, the people seemed to feel this object was some type of missile or small type of aircraft, there is nothing to substantiate this feeling outside of the fact that radar showed nothing at

COMMENTS OF Approving Officer:

1. It is to be noted that the Approving Officer does not agree with the comments of the Preparing Officer concerning the uniformity of the size, shape, and color of the objects. The reports of the four sources regarding these items varied considerably, and, consequently, no generalization can be made.

2. However, the Approving Officer concurs with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that these sightings were probably meteors in the same general area at approximately the same time.

a. In all four instances, the sightings conformed to meteor criteria regarding size, shape, color, speed, length of time observed, etc.

b. In addition, Dr. Maynard F. Jordan, Professor of Astronomy, University of Maine, confirmed the possibility that there could be more than one meteor in the same general area at the same time, which was probably the case in this particular series of sightings.
