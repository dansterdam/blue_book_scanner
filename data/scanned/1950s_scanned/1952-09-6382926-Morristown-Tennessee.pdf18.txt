Here's Flying Objects (Vermilion Copy) (continued):

Of course this does not contain the details that were seen at the time, so I guess I will just keep on guessing and wondering. 

All the forgotton will seem rather vague, I am sure, but I am merely explaining the matter of strange vague glimpses that I cannot clarify.

It is possible others saw this and have reported it, and if so, it would seem the more reports that come in would help to clear this much more.

I am merely trying to be a good citizen in reporting the above and should you have any questions on this subject I will be glad to try to answer them to the best of my knowledge and ability.
