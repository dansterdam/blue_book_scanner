Text from the document:

"Mrs. T______ was standing in her yard when she observed what she thought was an airplane coming from the southeast. She watched it approach and she said to her husband who was standing nearby, "Look at that airplane." However, as it came closer, she realized that it was not an airplane but was a strange object flying very rapidly. The object disappeared.

The object moved through the air like a streak. It was erratic and its movements were jerky. The object was larger than the rest and altogether covered a good part of the sky.

It didn't seem too high in the air and was moving very fast. It appeared to go up then down when it disappeared. The time that it was visible was around 12 seconds.

She turned to call her husband and by the time she looked around again it was gone - leaving no trace.

The sun was just coming up and the visibility was very good."
