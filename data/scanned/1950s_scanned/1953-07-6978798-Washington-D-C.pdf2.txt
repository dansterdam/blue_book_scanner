The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet summarizing data from an observation that occurred on July 28, 1954. The text on the document is as follows:

ON 28 JULY 1954 I WAS ON DUTY AS SCHEDULED IN A CONTROL TOWER OPERATED BY USAF AT BOLLING AIR FORCE BASE WASHINGTON D.C. AT 2310 HRS I OBSERVED TWO BRIGHTLY LIGHTED OBJECTS ONE ABOVE THE OTHER THE LOWER OBJECT BEING MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE UPPER ONE. AS THEY SEEMED TO BE HOVERING OVER COLLEGE PARK AREA OF MARYLAND I IMMEDIATELY CALLED MY COMMANDING OFFICER. WHILE THE SECOND OBJECT DISAPPEARED THE ABOVE WENT ANOTHER OBJECT LOOKS LIKE STARS HOWEVER WERE MUCH LOWER AND LARGER THAN ANY OF THE STARS IN THE SKYS THIS NIGHT, UNABLE TO TAKE MORE PICTURES DUE TO MALFUNCTION OF CAMERA.
