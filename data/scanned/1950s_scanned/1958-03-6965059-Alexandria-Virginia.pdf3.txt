The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a routing slip. The text on the routing slip provides some information about a suggested reply to a letter from the general public, a note of thanks for reporting, a check of extra satellite orbital tracks, and an indication that the object has not been conclusively identified as yet or probably was a meteor. It also mentions that the reports will be used as part of the continuous study and investigation of aerial phenomena.

SUGGESTED REPLY TO LETTER FROM GENERAL PUBLIC.
a. NOTE OF THANKS FOR REPORTING.  
b. A CHECK OF EXTRA SATELLITE ORBITAL TRACKS INDICATES OBJECT SEEN WAS NOT SPUTNIK.
c. ALTHOUGH THE OBJECT HAS NOT BEEN CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFIED AS YET, WE ARE OF THE OPINION THAT IT PROBABLY WAS A METEOR.
THE REPORTS WILL BE USED AS PART OF OUR CONTINUOUS STUDY AND INVESTIGATION OF AERIAL PHENOMENA.
