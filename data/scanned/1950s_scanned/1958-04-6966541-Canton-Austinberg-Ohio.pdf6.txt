MEMO FOR FILE

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation With C.O. Canton Filter Center, Ohio.
Lt. Weaver, 2d Air Division, Project Glendalk 3-7-58, to Canton, Ohio Incident, 7 April 1958

1. Lt. Weaver checked his chief GOC operator at Austinburg, Ohio regarding the Homesick HOO case reported in TR 58-3-275. No knowledge on their part.

2. Lt. Weaver called Brookfield ABS, 626/ADAXON, talked to C.O. Capt. Powell, who checked his records. No record of anyone reporting a UFO.

3. However, when asked about the "Homesick HOO" case, Capt. Powell stated that 562-nd AISS in a swamp north of Austinburg, Capt. Powell stated, that 662-nd had tracked and identified a meteor trail. Further, this was confirmed by a Cleveland TV Station: Meteor passed over the area - and disappeared towards Canada. (Not observed directly as they fall near their locality; an optical illusion proven for over 12 years of UFO Project evidence.)
