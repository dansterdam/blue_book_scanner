"In accordance with USAF Ltr AFCIE-GC-1 (WCEL).* subject: 'Reporting of Information on Unconventional Aircraft', September 1950, the following information is submitted:

1. Three targets were picked up by Westover Approach Control Radar, located approximately 25 miles from Westover, approaching the station. Over 2,000 feet of film was exposed by the station, one target faded and disappeared. The other two objects were picked up and moved away again several times on courses of 240° and 260° without changing speed, maneuvering sharply, or taking evasive action. Estimated speeds were approximately the same distance apart (estimated one half mile) during the entire observation. Estimated speeds were approximately 500 m.p.h. During this observation, ground radar determined by triangulation that the objects were 40,000 feet in altitude. The targets approached and faded out in the radar pattern. Ground Control Intercept station, located near Manchester, New Hampshire, confirmed the sighting and was in communication with Westover.

2. Initial time of pick-up was 1045 EST, 24 January 1951. Length of observation was estimated at 10 to 30 minutes.
