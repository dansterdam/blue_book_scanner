The report mentions that a photograph was taken, but it is described as a "black square with a diagonal band of light" which was supposedly the only picture of the event. The text also mentions that several articles were published regarding this incident.

Mexico Sees: * 
Flying Saucers
--or Something

MEXICO CITY, March 11 (AP)
The director of a Mexican observatory where the photograph was taken, said it was 'only a picture of something round in the sky which could not be identified.'
The photograph was a black square with a diagonal band of light, which the newspaper 'Excelsior' said was "probably the only picture of its kind taken within the larger countries."
Luis Enrique Erro, director of the National Observatory where the photograph was taken, said it was the impression that it could have been the picture of some unknown object flying very high in the sky.
More reports of flying saucers poured into the press from all over Mexico. The incident received nationwide attention and the newspaper printed a series of articles which appeared in three magazines.
