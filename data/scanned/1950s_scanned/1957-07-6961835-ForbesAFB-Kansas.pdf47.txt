The shared image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Transcribing the text from the document:

21. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like you to give us a description of what you saw. Of what type material would you say it was made of, how large would it be, and what shape and color would it have been, and when possible, give a description of the object as the object which you saw.

ACTUAL SIZE OR DIMENSION COULD BE DETERMINED ONLY THE LIGHT.

42. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this? (Circle one) Yes No If you answered no, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?

43. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it? SOME OBJECT OR ENERGY SOURCE THAT HAD THE ABILITY TO MOVE AT A MUCH HIGHER VELOCITY THAN THE RIGHT SAFETY MAY HAVE COVERED ACROSS THAT AREA AND ALSO THROUGH "UTAH" WHICH WOULD REQUIRE A HIGH DEGREE OF TECHNOLOGY- IT SHOWED INTELLIGENT CONTROLLED MOVEMENT FROM GROUND OBSERVERS BY "TRACKING IT".
