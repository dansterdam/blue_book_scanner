Jan.29,1957 Mr. Wallace W. Elwood Air Technical Intelligence Center Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Ohio 

Dear Mr. Elwood: 
  
Thank you so very much for your painstaking letter of the 17th with its most welcome enlargements of the tiny little “Space ship” print which I sent to you. Unfortunately the film has not yet come to light but those who saw the film were convinced that it was no water mark nor imperfection on the airplane window.

I wish I could give you the information you seem to need. I could not fill out the questionnaire you sent me as I had none of that required information. As my film was not developed until the middle of September, and as I did not see the ship, I have no idea of the exact moment of its being taken or caught by my camera. As for the flight number and such details, all I know is that I was in a commercial plane flying between Coos Bay and Portland,Oregon on September 6th, 1956, leaving Coos Bay at 2:30 P.M. and arriving at Portland at 3:30 P.M. As I took the pictures from the plane soon after taking off, I estimated the time to be around three o'clock.

I thought you might know whether we had anything in the air in that location about that time that might resemble this, but I didn't realize that you needed so much detail regarding the sighting.

In any case I am grateful to you for your detailed answer to me and the time you took to make it all clear to me.

I assume that I may keep the prints (since you did not mention their return) which you sent on and in that case thank you very much.

                                                                                          Very truly yours,
                                                                                         
                                                                                          ________________________
