FLOWER AND COOK OBSERVATORIES

1959 July 30

Executive Officer,
Civil Information Division
Operations Research Service
Department of the Air Force
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

Last year the Executive Officer very kindly, in reply to a request from me for information about certain flying saucers, sent us a considerable amount of useful information, which can be used in the activities of the Astronomical Society.

During the past year or so a large number of fireball have appeared over the eastern or middle western states, and in the cause of the five to be mentioned, I have been able to assemble a number of observations. This despite the fact that it is extremely difficult to make good records of them, I am therefore writing to request that you be good enough to send me copies of any or all reports in your hands dealing with these bodies.

I may add the Astrophysic Office of the U.S.Navy has for over 30 years effectively cooperated with us on scientific matters, and it has been possible to solve for many important problems. Such cooperation from your office, and a routine matter, would also be appreciated.

The specific bodies I now request information on are:

1958 April 26/21 Southeastern States
1958 July 4/5 North Carolina etc.
1958 Oct. 30 North Carolina etc.
1958 Dec. 12/14 New York, New Jersey etc.  
1959 Feb. 10/11 South Carolina etc.

It would be a great favor to me and useful to science if
you would be good enough to send me observations dealing with these fireballs.

Very sincerely yours,
Charles P. Olivier
