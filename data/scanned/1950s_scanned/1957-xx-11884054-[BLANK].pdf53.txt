The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Jet streams, assume near horizontal positions, and move with considerable speed. Encountering a flat, circular object (balloon flattened on top) under darkness or adverse weather conditions, arising from below can be startling even to experienced pilots.

Separate paragraph: Balloons can be observed when the sun is behind the horizon and the earth is in comparative darkness (see Fig. 3). This has resulted in a considerable number of UFO reports over the last ten years. The two general "clues" here is that a. the sighting is usually observed just before dawn or little after sunset and b. the shape of the UFO appears either as "disc" or "spherical" and bright reddish-orange, or reddish-white.

The coloration is caused by the sun's slant rays reflecting off the balloon's surfaces.

ASTRONOMICAL BODIES: Separate paragraphs substantially as follows:
Meteors will appear to vary in shape from round to elongated, teardrop in shape, and in size from tiny pinpoints to the size of the moon. Colors will range from yellowish-white through red, blue and green hues depending on the atmosphere. 
Although observed singly, meteors may be observed in clusters.
The time in sight is generally less than 10 seconds. Although improbable that meteoric bodies themselves can be picked up on radar, the meteor trails are generally good reflectors and will often "paint" on radarscopes.
An extremely brilliant, rarely seen form of meteorite is called a "fireball". Fire balls, unlike ordinary meteorites, do not burn out.
