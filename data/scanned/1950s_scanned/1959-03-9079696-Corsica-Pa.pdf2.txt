The image contains two sketches or diagrams, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line with labels indicating how high an object was observed. The second sketch shows a larger panoramic view with a smaller inset sketch, which appears to be an example of how to complete the larger sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (sighting). Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when it disappeared from view.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" on the position where you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
