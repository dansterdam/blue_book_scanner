RECORD OF INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
1. DATE OF OBSERVATION: 12 JULY 52
2. TIME OF OBSERVATION: 2000 EST
3. LOCATION OF OBSERVATION: NEW YORK, N.Y.
4. DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT(S):
The object was observed silently hovering and maneuvering at an altitude of 1000-2000 feet above the ground for approximately 5 minutes. The object had a luminous pale blue oval shape with two appendages extending from the center. The object was observed by one observer, Mr. Edward Rommel, who was located at 37-11 103rd St., Corona, New York.
5. BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVESTIGATION:
The object was observed hovering and maneuvering silently at an altitude of approximately 1000-2000 feet. After approximately 5 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated and streaked out of sight at a high rate of speed. Mr. Rommel was able to observe the object clearly and stated that it was definitely not an aircraft, helicopter, or any known type of aerial vehicle. No other witnesses were present at the time of the observation.
6. CONCLUSIONS:
The object observed appears to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). There is no logical explanation for the type of aerial maneuvers and performance characteristics exhibited by the object. The case is classified as UNIDENTIFIED.
