Unfortunately, this image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically report 1951-02-7006612 from East Africa.

Reported that if the object was a flying machine it was not going above 500 yards altitude but maintaining an altitude of something like 200 yards. The object was described as cigar-shaped with very bright lights at either end which appeared to be two separate objects but were still connected. The object was seen on Sunday and Monday for several hours each day. On Monday morning it was seen to appear to be rotating as it lay stationary in the sky. The object was yellowish in color and had definite extremities which appeared to be distinct sections. The object remained stationary and still in the sky for long periods and observers were convinced that this object was not an aircraft. The object finally disappeared in the distance and observers were unable to determine how or when it left. Apparently nothing definite was concluded regarding its nature or identity.
