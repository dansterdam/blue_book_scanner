Honorable James H. Douglas
Secretary of the Air Force 
Washington, D. C.

Dear Secretary Douglas:

There has been some concern among newspaper people over the attitude of the Air Force toward Project Blue Book. It appears that considerable difficulty has been encountered in obtaining information about Project Blue Book, particularly from the Phoenix, Arizona, area. The air force has the facts. But since it appears that a collection of information at the Air Forcedisputed information, is that it could not be regarded as reliable. 

The Air Force now considers all news or information about flying saucers classified and refused to give information to the information office in Washington. This method of handling the information has been greatly criticized in recent weeks. On the other hand, it is recognized that the Air Force confidential information dealing with its own internal matters cannot be made public. However, it would seem that the American public needs to be kept informed on this subject, which has great public interest and importance. Our recommendation is that the Air Force cooperate fully and make more information available about Project Blue Book, even to the point where the Air Force officially should keep a separate record that would really be kept secret. This particular incident, however, along the border line
but does not seem to be, the way it is handled it is hard to see why, and it would seem that there could be some way to give the public more information on the subject, particularly in view of the fact that whenever the Air Force appears, as it often does, to hold back, it makes the public more suspicious and creates an undesirable climate. This may all be a matter of public relations which, as you well know, needs constant attention. We would appreciate your looking into this matter and let us know what can be done about it.
