Sirs:

Enclosed is questionnaire, relative to my sighting of July 25, filled out to the best of my knowledge.

Attached are two additional reports of objects sighted by this writer since that date, both of which, I believe, merit further examination. Both are analogous to the meteor, but evidenced several anomalies strikingly peculiar to meteor phenomena. I have not made public the latter two summaries for personal reasons.

For many years I have studied the skies, and, have in the last eight months taken an avid interest in "Saucer" phenomena. It has become a part of my daily regimen to watch for these "freaks" --- a vigilance that has accounted for my three unusual sightings.

Although I have attempted to evaluate these sightings, I can only surmise as to their true identity. From the history of sightings made known to us I have personally concluded, the objects are controlled, artificial devices. If not a part of U.S. research, then surely they must be of extra-terrestrial origin.

Sincerely,

Cincinnati 27, Ohio
