RECOMMENDATIONS
IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT GOUGH BE QUESTIONED FURTHER BECAUSE
OF HIS CONFUSION ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND TO FIND OUT IF
HE HAS ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH HE DID NOT MENTION.
SINCE GOUGH THOUGHT IT WAS A LIGHT JET AND MISSILE AS HIS FIRST
EXPLANATION, HIS LATER CHANGED MIND ABOUT IT BEING SOME OTHER
AERIAL OBJECT IS QUESTIONABLE.

ABOUT LIKE A DC-6
1. GOUGH CLAIMS HIS WIFE AND NEIGHBOR, MR. BURLEW, ALSO OBSERVED
THE OBJECT DURING ITS FLIGHTS IN THE SKY.
2. GOUGH CLAIMS TO HAVE SEEN A GREAT AIRBORNE "THING" OR
STRUCTURE WHICH HE DESCRIBES AS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A DC-6.
3. IT WAS SATURDAY APRIL 12 OVER THE ROCKY MT. BETWEEN
3:10 AND 3:20 AM WHEN HE OBSERVED THIS LUMINESCENT OBJECT DISK.
4. THE OBJECT MADE SOME RAPID MANEUVERS AND WAS TRAVELING AT
CONSIDERABLE SPEED AT TIMES.
5. GOUGH WAS MYSTIFIED TO SEE THIS STRANGE OBJECT AND COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS. HE COULDN'T LAUGH AT STORY.
CONFIDENTIAL REPORTS ON UNUSUAL SIGHTINGS:
(33-5 MILLIONS) AND JEFF HAVE ABOUT 1/3 GIPSON
LAKE SCOUTING ADVENTURE ON SATURDAY, MAY 5. SIGHTED WHAT
THEY THOUGHT WAS A LIGHT JET AND OR MISSILE AS FIRST
EXPLANATION. BUT LATER DECIDED IT WAS SOME OTHER TYPE OF
OBJECT UNLIKE ANY NOISE HE HAD HEARD BEFORE.
HOUSE SHOWED INSTRUCTIONS ISSUED TO GO INDOORS AND WATCH
BUT GOUGH AND WIFE SAW NOTHING.
AND WHICH CAUSED SHOCK HORROR WILDLY - GIPSON'S WIFE DID MENTIONED. NEITHER
MAY WIFE NOR I RECALL ANY UNUSUAL NOISE.
SHOULD HE AND WIFE BE INTERVIEWED? CONSISTENT VIBRATION
IS PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DISMISSED IT AS DOMESTIC ACTIVITY OR
SOMETHING SHOULD HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION.
ONLY THING HAD ANY UNUSUAL GLOW OR OBJECT REPORTED, BUT
REPORTER REFUSED TO BE INTERESTED TO BE INTERVIEWED IN SIMILAR
SIGHTING WHO WEREN'T SIMILAR.
