The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document, possibly from a Project Blue Book UFO report.

This tape is addressed to the Director of Intelligence U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C. The document discusses the sender's sighting of a U.F.O. in northern California on February 3, 1955, near Knights Landing, California. The sender discusses their history with the Air Force and their subsequent employment elsewhere. The text of the document is as follows:

This tape is addressed to the Director of Intelligence U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C. My name is [redacted], my residence [redacted], Lexington, Kentucky. Incidentally, this piece of tape was purchased by me and came from government sources and was not stolen from the Air Force. 

My name, I dare say, is particularly familiar to some of your people in the rusty part of their memory, but my memory of you people and some of the shenanigans you have pulled is burning freshly in my mind. Going back a long time, nearly five years to be exact, on February 3, 1955, that is about the date, I sighted a U.F.O. in northern California, down near Knights landing, California.

Since that day, so many things have happened that a hundred tapes at this particular speed of recording would not begin to encompass them. However, the things, rest assured, can be on this tape.

In May of 1958 I left R.C.A. for very good reasons and upon applying for a job elsewhere, in the Cape Canaveral area, it seemed that electronic technician positions were all closed. Very good. I wonder why? Well, eventually, I secured a job with Convair Astronautics. I hired in as an electronics technician and they tried to put me on as an electrician. I am pretty good at obeying hunches; several times I have done so.
