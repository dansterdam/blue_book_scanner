Dear Miss _________,

Your letter of 25 March 1957 to the Public Relations Office, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has been referred to this Center for reply.

We are of the opinion that the object sighted in your area about 5:20 P.M. on 23 March 1957 was a balloon which had been released in this area about that time. Similar objects were reported from the general area during the specific time and may present some unusual effects and characteristics when observed, but our investigation indicates that they were balloons of which there will be a number released in this area from time to time for various experimental purposes as shown by the recovery data below.

We have also included a copy of the summary of our Project Skyhook Special Report 144, which may be worth to you.

We appreciate your interest in the matter, and we are glad to have the opportunity to serve you.

Sincerely,

ROBERT E. O'CONNOR 
Captain, USAF
Assistant Adjutant
