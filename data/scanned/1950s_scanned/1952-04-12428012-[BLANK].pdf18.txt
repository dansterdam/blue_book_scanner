SLIDE NO. 10

Results of tests conducted with the DM-1 glider were to be 
utilized in the design and construction of the P-13 fighter.

The P-13 incorporated a delta planform with a 60Â° swept-back 
leading edge. A ram-jet power plant was proposed but no information 
is available regarding its development except that several coal 
burning types were being considered.

This slide shows another projection, of the same kind done 
previously with the Horton design. It is a projection of the possible 
of the P-13 design.

If a development of the P-13 project were actively pursued it 
would probably follow along the original German thinking. Such 
an aircraft is estimated to have the following characteristics:

Wing span 20 ft

Wing area 220 sq ft

Aspect ratio 1.8

Sweep at leading co 
edge 60

Gross weight 7700 lb

ATIC - 1 April 1951 23
