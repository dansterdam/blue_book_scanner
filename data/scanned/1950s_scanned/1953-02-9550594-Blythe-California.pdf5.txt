On 4 February 1953, at 1325 hours Pacific Standard Time, I sighted a 50,000 above and behind the airplane. It was of round shape and of a light green color like an apple, and approximately 30 minutes duration. The fluctuation of the same was very slow. I observed it for 30 miles and the object disappeared very slowly. The direction was west. This object was seen from the lower left window.
