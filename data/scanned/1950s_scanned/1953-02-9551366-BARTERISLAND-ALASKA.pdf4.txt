AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

The following report is based on personal interrogation of the source (Captain Robert S. Barnes) and has been reviewed by source for accuracy and completeness.

On the morning of 8 February 1953, Captain Barnes was thawing and heating a C-47 aircraft at the Barter Island air strip, Barter Island, Alaska. Captain Barnes was wearing a fur parka and was standing beside his aircraft which was being readied for a mission. Suddenly, his attention was drawn to a bright object hovering approximately 1,000 feet above the ground and slightly to the west of the strip. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was giving off a very bright light, which illuminated the area under the object. The object hovered for approximately 5 minutes, then started moving rapidly over to the heater located in front of the left wing of the C-47. He immediately realized that the object was not only illuminating the area but was causing a bright glare, washing out the details of the C-47. The object then moved to a position directly over the point which was not being heated, i.e., the tail. The object then rapidly moved from this position directly overhead to a point about 2,000 feet over the building area where it had been hovering initially. 

The color of the light was similar to that of white hot metal except that it did not appear to illuminate the area and only seemed to be glowing or shimmering when it blinked out. He described it as a cold but brilliant light.

Captain Barnes estimated the size as smaller than a C-47 or approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter. Captain Barnes reports that this estimate was based on the fact that the object maintained a fixed relation to the C-47 and the fact that the object passed directly overhead.

The object seemed to be affected by the wind as it hovered at 2,000 feet, and Captain Barnes estimated its speed to be controlled craft. As it moved against the wind to near its original position, the object moved about 500 feet.

The sound emanating from the object was described as not loud but a deep, heavy sound such as large congregated motors would make while operating.

After hovering for approximately 45 seconds, the object began to climb out using a pulsing or fluttering type of motion. The climb was not at a high rate of speed, and the vertical movement was greater than the lateral movement. As it climbed, the object blinked regularly at about one minute intervals.

During the climb-out, 1st Lieutenant Lewis E. Griffin was driving a vehicle from the building toward the object for Lieutenant Griffin. At this time, the object was directly overhead. Lieutenant Griffin estimated the object to be 10,000 to 12,000 feet in altitude and estimated its diameter to be approximately 30 to 40 feet.
