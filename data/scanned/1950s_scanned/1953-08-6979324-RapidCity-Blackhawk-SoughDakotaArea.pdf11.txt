OPERATIONS REPORT - 10-14 August 1953

The IBM statistical analysis being prepared by Project Stork was expected to be completed this week but Project Blue Book was informed that the study would not be completed before the last of August. This analytical study is expected to be of much help to this project in solving future unidentified aerial object mysteries. Outstanding trends or patterns are expected to show up in this analysis.

Project Blue Book was informed this week that Project Stork has begun the process of obtaining suitable diffraction gratings for the Wildon cameras that are presently out in the field. It is estimated that this effort will cost approximately $3,000 and that the grids should be available within 90 days. When the suitable grids are available to ATIC, the cameras will be recalled, grids mounted, and redistributed into the field. Steps are being made to speed up the operations and experimentation and manufacture of these grids.

Capt E. J. Ruppelt departed Dayton on 10 August 1953 for Rapid City, South Dakota, to investigate an unidentified aerial object which occurred in the Rapid City area at 2205 MST on 5 August 1953. Capt Ruppelt interrogated the observers, radar and visual, thoroughly and was unable to come up with a definite conclusion. The story of the observers has made it difficult for Project Blue Book to establish the identity of the object as being a known phenomenon. Capt Ruppelt has recommended that further study of this incident be made by ATIC and Project Blue Book contract astronomer.

Project Blue Book has received ten reports of unidentified aerial objects none of which are of too much importance. During the last two months, the number of reports received have remained relatively the same.
