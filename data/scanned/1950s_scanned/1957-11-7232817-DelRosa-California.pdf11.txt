U.S. Cutter  
Sees 'Object' 
Over Gulf
Radar Contact  
Is Maintained  
For 27 Minutes

A brilliant mystery object  
was reported sighted over  
the Gulf of Mexico by a U.S.  
Coast Guard cutter, even as  
our Force special investigates  
similar reports. The Cutter Sebago's message said the  
'object' was tracked on the  
radar for a period of 27 minutes, and during this period, the object attained a  
speed of over 1,200 miles per  
hour. The sighting was made  
near Corpus Christi, Texas.

(The Sebago's captain, Lt.  
Comdr. Strong Piper, said his  
crew sighted the object and  
tracked it on radar screen as  
'good, strong signal' which remained in view for over 27  
minutes.)

At this time, the object  
was moving at an estimated  
1,000 miles per hour, faster  
than any known jet.
