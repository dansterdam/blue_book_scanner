Project Blue Book 
Writer: Emerson AFB
Date: 29 July 1959

Gentlemen:

Enclosed is a report of an unidentified flying object which I saw on 23 July 1959. A copy has been sent to both NICAP(in Washington, D.C.) and AFSC(in Charleston, S.C.).

In paragraph #5 I said the object could not have been a conventional aircraft/satellite. The only known object it might have been is an "internal reflection" of artificial light. It was that, I don't think.

I checked today with the four Chicago newspapers. None had a UFO report for that date.

Would you please acknowledge this report? Also, I would like to know any conclusions you may come to and what prompted these conclusions.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
