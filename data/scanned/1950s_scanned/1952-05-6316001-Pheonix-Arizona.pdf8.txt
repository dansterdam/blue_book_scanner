The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, rather than a photograph. It consists of various shapes and symbols arranged in a grid-like pattern. There are what look like X-shaped symbols, as well as arrow-like shapes pointing in different directions, and some smaller shapes that could be interpreted as birds or other objects. The overall impression is of a graphical representation or diagram of some kind, rather than a photographic image.
