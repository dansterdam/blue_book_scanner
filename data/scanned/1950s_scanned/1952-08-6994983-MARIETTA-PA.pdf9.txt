At 8.53 P.M. Sat. Aug 2, 1952 - 
at a point west of Marietta (Speedometer reading 71 miles) on the Maytown road) 45 yards north on the Mt. Joy road), an object was observed NW at first appearance of it. This object was emitting a very bright light, bluish-white in color, and would disappear at intervals of about 3 seconds, then reappear. At the point where it disappeared, it appeared to disperse in small particles. 
I spent several minutes observing this object, and while observing, it would appear to be as large as a car tire, then disappear altogether. Then it would reappear further north or south of the original position. The speed at which this object moved was tremendous, seemingly at times faster than any jet plane I have ever seen. Its maneuverability was also far beyond any aircraft I have ever observed. 
As I continued to watch this object, I noticed two smaller objects appear and take up a position to the east and west of the larger object. These smaller objects were also emitting a bright light, but not as intense as the larger one. They maintained their positions in relation to the larger object for approximately 5 minutes, then they too disappeared. 
The larger object continued on its northerly course and was lost from sight behind some trees in the distance. I waited for several minutes, but it did not reappear.
