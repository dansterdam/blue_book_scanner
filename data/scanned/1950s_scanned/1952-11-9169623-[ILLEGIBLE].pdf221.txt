The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch and diagram. The sketch shows the movement of an object in the sky, with instructions to draw a picture showing the shape of the object and its direction of movement.

The text in the image is as follows:

23. In the following sketch, place an "X" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "BP" at the position when you last saw it.

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path and a "DP" at the end of its path.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
