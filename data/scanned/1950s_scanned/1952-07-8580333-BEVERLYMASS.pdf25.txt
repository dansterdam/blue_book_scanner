Statement of unusual occurance observed by Base Photographer at approximately 0950, 8 July 1952, from photo window, CSGCG, BEVERLY, MASS.
While working on daily reports I was summoned by Base Photographer, one SKFGB who called me to window and look at airborne lights. 
Looking out the window to the North West there appeared to be what was thought to be aircraft. I actually could not say what it was other than it was anything. It could have been reflections from passing cars or from the ocean.
