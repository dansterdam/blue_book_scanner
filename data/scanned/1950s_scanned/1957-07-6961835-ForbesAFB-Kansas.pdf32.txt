The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather a technical diagram and accompanying text. The diagram appears to be related to an "ESTIMATED RANGE AT WHICH ALA-6 COULD DETECT SIGNAL FROM CPS-6B/FPS-10 RADAR VERTICAL-CENTER THAN AND ITS SUBURBS AT 56-3/4 ALTITUDE OF 36,500 FEET".

The text provided is as follows:

APPENDIX B

ESTIMATED RANGE AT WHICH ALA-6 COULD DETECT SIGNAL FROM CPS-6B/FPS-10 RADAR VERTICAL-CENTER THAN AND ITS SUBURBS AT 56-3/4 ALTITUDE OF 36,500 FEET.

(Distances shown are as measured along surface of the earth and are not slant ranges.)

UPPER-LOBE
12° 2¼"
MAIN BEAM
2°
LOWER SIDE-LOBE
1.5°

DISTANCE IN MILES
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Width of Main Beam = 10 db. down points
Com-Lobe = 15 db. down from Main Beam
Lower Side-Lobe = 15 db. down from Main Beam
Upper Side-Lobe = 12 db. down from Main Beam

NOTE: Radar energy reflected off the ground may partially fill "gap" shown between lower side-lobe and main beam because of antenna's low elevation angle. The elevation angle has been elevated slightly to clear local obstructions.
