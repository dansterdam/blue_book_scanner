1. The following is in response to CFIT IO-511 dated 4 August 1953:
On 25 August, the writer, on a periodic visit to Mexican Air Force headquarters, had a conference with General Augusto Aguirre Castillo, Commanding General, Mexican Air Force.

2. During the conversation, it was learned that a number of 5247 type aircraft, with the designation "F2H", which were being operated by the Mexican Air Force, had encountered difficulties in connection with their normal flight operations. It appears that the difficulties were experienced during cloud seeding operations. The pilots had reported that their aircraft "stalled" and made violent maneuvers while operating at altitudes in cloud seeding operations.
