COMMENTS OF INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: The SCR-12 Fire Control System went inoperative unexpectedly during the pursuit of the unidentified target by "CANADIAN CLUB" to check the SCR-522 radar on the return flight. The radar controllers at the Great Falls Air Force Base failed to maintain coordination or control of this engagement, and cleared air traffic through the area at the 8,000 Airspace Control and Warning System. CANADIAN CLUB was continuing the pursuit at low altitude until ordered to break off under mysterious circumstances. NEGATIVE AIR CONTACT was made, and the ultimate fate of the target still remains unknown. THE DUTY SCR DIREC TOR OF THE CANADIAN CLUB RELATED THESE COMMENTS CONFIDENTIALLY.
