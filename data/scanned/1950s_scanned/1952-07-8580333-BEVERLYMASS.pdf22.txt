The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather text-based content from a Project Blue Book UFO report document. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

a clear picture with the lens setting on infinity. The objects outside the building would be in focus. Their brightness or reflections would decrease as the photographer approached the window. The initial photo analysis indicates that the magnitude of the light and substantiation of the fact that the light source was not external is correct. There is no indication or proof to suggest to us that the photograph is genuine. The photo contained as reflections of an interior light source and had the camera been focused for a shorter distance the outlines of the interior light sources would have been sharper. It is believed that there is sufficient evidence to substantiate the evaluation of this photo as reflections of internal light sources.
