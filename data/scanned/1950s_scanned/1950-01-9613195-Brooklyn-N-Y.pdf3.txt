Dear Sir:

On January 2, at about 22:00, Mrs. [REDACTED] and I observed what we believe to be one of the "Flying Saucers". It was visible for a period of about three minutes, at an estimated altitude of 35째, bearing about 340째 true from a point in Brooklyn, in approximate latitude 40째41'N, longitude 73째55'W.

It was in the clouds, remaining stationary and emitting a blueish-green glow. For a period of about 30 seconds, the intensity of the glow was very marked.

If this information is of any value to you, I shall be pleased to continue to be on watch for these effects.

Sincerely yours,
[REDACTED]
