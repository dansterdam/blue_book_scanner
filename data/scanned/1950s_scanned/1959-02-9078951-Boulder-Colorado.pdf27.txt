The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, which is a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Thank you for the entire photo and the latest slides picture of the man hitting a flying object. I have no comments on the photo since I am unable to identify anyone. I hope to do another motion picture, preferably with animation. We are really careful concerning the subject, as you understand.

It was, of course, extremely satisfying to know that your experience proved the correctness of my feeling that that lady. As for the size of the picture, there is no objection at all. The image of the reflected sun is extremely bright. It is perhaps understandable why at the time the negative appeared overexposed. We are going to have the negative enlarged to see what other details we can discover. However, if you wish to send a clearer print, we would be glad to receive it.

I am to be on television, the program called "Today." The morning of May 16th has been set aside for me to appear. If I may show it. Any subject. Flying saucers. I shall be interviewed. I am anxious that they interview me as impersonally as possible, so that the public will get a square deal.

With best wishes, and looking forward to hearing from you again.

Cordially yours,
[redacted]
Director
