The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document. It does not contain any photographs, but rather a typed report. As an OCR system, I will now proceed to output all the text found in the document:

ATOPIC-HIGH
SUBJECT: (U) Request for Additional Information

TO:
Commander (ADC)
H.Q.53D. AIR DIVISION

During 17 July 1952, this Center received a letter from Dr. Spain, on 20 July 1952, reporting a UFO sighting in Spain which was completed as requested. (UNCLASSIFIED)

2. It is believed that this case involves some significance in that the observers are apparently relatives of an associate of this Center and previous recommendations (UNCLASSIFIED) have been made concerning the sighting.

3. Regardless of the time lapse involved, it is requested that a member of your organization be assigned to interview the individuals concerned for the following data: (UNCLASSIFIED)
    a. A possible evaluation of the source's reliability.
    b. Any additional facts the source would like to disclose.

It is very desirable that the original 35mm color slide, if available, be obtained for examination. It is reported that the slide has been damaged, but it is requested that it be retrieved if possible.

4. The enclosures to this correspondence are forwarded for the information and utilization of the investigating officer concerned and it is requested that they be returned to this Center upon completion of the interview. (UNCLASSIFIED)
