In compliance with provisions of AUC Letter No 200-1, "Reporting of Information on Unconventional Aircraft", 11 April 1951, reference: sub-paragraph Sb thereof, the following detailed report, as required in sub-paragraph 5b(1) thereof, is submitted,
concerning an unusual sighting, on its radar scopes, by a station located at North Truro, Massachusetts.

(a) Description of object: Returns indicated a characteristic "sausage shape", in which the dimension in range is smaller than the dimension in azimuth. Amplitude of the return varied from radar "pick-up" to "pick-up" and was never apparently strong; 
These two characteristics are typical of any radar return of an aircraft or flying object. Possible prediction of the object being flying object was the extreme range of final pickup. Normally, a flying object capable of indicated speed (references below)
Would be streamlined.

(b) Time of sighting: From 22-0128Z to 22-0222Z, for duration of four (4) minutes. Estimated speed: approximately 1,000 knots.

(c) Manner of observation: By radar "pick up" on Plan Position Indicator (PPI) radar set, on frequencies of 2992 and 3011 megacycles, by station at Nort Truro, Massachusetts,Observation from surface station.

(d) Location of observer: Station located at 42028'W; 7003'W. Single object observed along track, from 34010'6 5310' to 141010; 653 ", an unknown alt-
cade, at location approximately 120 to 300 miles East, ESE, and ENE of
observer. Approximate observation pickups. Course: approx 265E.


Identiification of observer: Radar station. Reliability: normal, Estimate of reliability and experience: unknown.

(e) Weather conditions at time of sighting: clear, visibility: 15 miles, Temperature: 35 degrees F.

(g) Other factors which might account for phenomenon: Nothing definite. How-ever, the suggestion is offered that: (1) annual "shower" of meteors, normally due 12-15 November, each year, may be a possible cause; (2) pos- sible meteor "burn front" 
  course, due to return near the Earth, October, 1951. No meteorological phenomena in evidence, however, to indicate either.
  The possibility remains that the object may have been an unconventional flying object.

(h) No physical evidence exists of the observation. Object was above ocean.

(i) No identification or interception procedures were undertaken.

(j) Local aircraft airborne at time of sightings: No information available.
