THE VEHICLE OR OBJECT SAID TO HAVE BEEN VIEWED AND
THE PHYSICAL DETAILS:
THE BALLOON? WAS LAUNCHED BY THE NATURAL SCIENCE
SECTION OF THE DAYTON POWER & LIGHT CO. AND AFTER
IT WILL LEAD TO PLACING ONE OF THE BALLOONS. 
I WILL BE SHOT. TRE BALLOON WAS TO DO STUDIES ON
THE UPPER AIR AND WEATHER CONDITIONS AND NO FURTHER
DESCRIPTION WAS GIVEN. THIS BALLOON WAS ORANGE 
AND ABOUT 15 TO 20 FEET IN DIAMETER AND HAD TtB TYPE
OF DOUBLE EXHAUST USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH TWO-STAGE
ROCKET-POWERED VEHICLES. IT PRODUCED A BRIGHT VAPOR 
TRAIL IN THE EVENING SKY. WITNESS SAID THEY RECEIVED
A 78' CALL FROM WITNESS 6.15 -

AND IN ADDITION, IT APPEARED TO ME ALMOST INVISIBLE 
AT FIRST, AND WAS NOTICED ONLY BECAUSE OF THE BRIGHT 
VAPOR TRAIL IT LEFT. IT CLIMBED VERY RAPIDLY AND ONCE 
IT REACHED ITS PEAK ALTITUDE LEVEL, IT APPEARED TO HOVER
ALMOST MOTIONLESS FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WITNESS
SAID THEY RECEIVED ONLY 7 CALLS. IT'S A QUITE LIMITED 
PARTICIPATION AND EXAMINATION.

TAKE IT - IT'S A FAMILIAR BALLOON. ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE 
ON ITS WAY. I DIDN'T DROP ANYTHING AND I CERTAINTY DIDN'T 
LAUNCH ANYTHING. THEY DIDN'T SEE WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY SAW.

IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS OBJECT THAT THEY OBSERVED WAS 
SIMPLY A BALLOON THAT WAS LAUNCHED BY THE NATURAL SCIENCE 
SECTION OF THE DAYTON POWER & LIGHT CO AND WAS INTENDED
TO DO STUDIES ON THE UPPER AIR AND WEATHER CONDITIONS.
ALTHOUGH IT MAY HAVE APPEARED SOMEWHAT UNCONVENTIONAL 
BECAUSE OF ITS ORANGE COLOR AND DOUBLE EXHAUST CONFIGURATION,
IT DOES FIT THE DESCRIPTION OF A FAIRLY COMMON WEATHER 
BALLOON THAT WOULD BE USED FOR THAT TYPE OF UPPER AIR STUDY.
