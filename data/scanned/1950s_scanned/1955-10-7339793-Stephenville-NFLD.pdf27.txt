'Full Moon' Rocket Explosion in Octol

Washington, Oct. 6 (AP) - To explode a sodium vapor rocket 300 miles high in the atmosphere and study the reactions may lead to development of an artificial "moonlight," the Air Force announced today.
The test will be made in the absence of a natural moonlight and will be designed to study the effect of sodium vapor release in the upper atmosphere and to determine how much artificial "moonlight" could be produced.
The test rocket, which is part of a series of high-altitude experiments, is expected to reach an altitude of about 300 miles and release a cloud of sodium vapor, which will glow brightly and remain visible for some time, according to Air Force officials.
The test is scheduled for sometime in October, although no definite date has been set.
Similar tests in the past have shown that sodium vapor released at high altitudes will form a glowing cloud visible for hundreds of miles and that the sodium atoms can persist in the upper atmosphere for a considerable period.
The Americans may release enough sodium to produce a "full moon," the article states, but the exact amount needed to create artificial moonlight is not known. The test is part of a series of high-altitude experiments aimed at studying the ionosphere.
