To Whom It May Concern:
Subject: Unknown object observed by Captain George D. Keller

Ozark Airline's Flight 305 departed Chicago at 1930 CST. The flight was conducted at an altitude of 10,000 feet MSL and in accordance with Visual Flight Rules. The crew consisted of Captain George D. Keller, First Officer R. Bullard and Stewardess.

First Officer Bullard was flying the aircraft from the left seat; the co-pilot seat was in the right seat. As the flight approached Buckley, Illinois, First Officer Bullard called my attention to a bright object in the sky. It was first observed at about 2015 and was observed for from two to five degrees in an upward line to our line of vision; appearing to be above 20,000 feet and for the balance of the observation, which lasted approximately five minutes, the object maintained a relatively constant position.

The object was in a definite horizontal line of flight traveling from the west, southeast - the line of flight being from the northwest. As the object approached, the crew observed that it appeared to be an intense white light, with a very well tail. By description, the object seemed to be circular or elliptical and was definitely in excess of 500 feet distance. The object then proceeded on its course and was lost to our vision. The signal lights of our aircraft were not turned on at the time it was observed.

To Ferry command at the First Officer said he watched it for approximately five seconds as the range closed, and he did not know what he was looking at.
