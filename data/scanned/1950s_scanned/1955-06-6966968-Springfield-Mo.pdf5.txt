APPROX. INITIALLY 2012 YEARS, 23 JUN 55. THE NEXT DAY AN UGO AND ITSELF MANEUVERED TO AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 3 MILES. THEN THEY ASCENDED TO A HIGHER ALTITUDE AND DISAPP. APPEARCD VERY SLOW. IN HIS OPINION THOSE WERE THE OBJECTS HE OBSERVED THROUGH BINOCULARS. ACCORDING TO HIS DESCRIPTION, COULD BE GIVEN EXCEPT FOR THE OBJECTS BEING FOUND AND GIVING OFF A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT. OBJECT WAS AT AN ESTIMATED FOUR TO FIVE HUNDRED FT. HIGH. A DOWNWARD DESCENDING GLOW OF 2 DEGREES, SPREAD IN ALL DIRECTIONS, SEEMED TO COME FROM THE QUESTION AND CONTOURS OF THE TWO OBSERVABLE. A BELIEVE IT TO BE POSSIBLY AN AIRCRAFT, EXCEPT THAT THE LIGHT GIVEN OFF WAS THE TRUE EFFECT WAS STEADY AND NOT FLUCTUATING.
