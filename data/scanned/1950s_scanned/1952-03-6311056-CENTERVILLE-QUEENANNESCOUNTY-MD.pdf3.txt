"FOR 1 MINUTE 1952 21 FT BIG OBJECT EXIST WHICH MOVED. IT MADE A NOISE LIKE THAT OF A MOTOR. WE COULD HEAR IT DISTINCTLY AND IT MOVED SLOWLY OVER OUR HEADS, GOING HIGH ENOUGH TO BE SEEN BY A ONE INCH OBJECT AT 900 FT. IT REMAINED VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 20 SECONDS AND THEN DISAPPEARED SUDDENLY AS IT HAD APPEARED. THERE WAS NO WIND AND THE SKY WAS CLOUDLESS. THE OBJECT WAS ROUND IN SHAPE, COLOR WAS SILVERY GRAY AND IT EMITTED NO TRAILS OR FLASHING LIGHTS."
