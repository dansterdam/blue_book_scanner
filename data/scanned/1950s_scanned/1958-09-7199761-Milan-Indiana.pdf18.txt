UFO sighting (Gatherburg, 14.)

SAFIS-5, Attn: Maj Tacker
APOSR-06-814

29 October 1952

Washington, D.C. objects sighted on the morning of 29 September 1952, as Gatherburg, and Washington, D.C. These objects were observed by several residents of the Washington, D.C. area.

1. The description of the object and possible sound is typical of meteor observations. The object was larger than a star and was brighter, as observed at Georgetown University. Several reports of this object and their conclusions indicate that it was a meteor.

2. The ATIC conclusion is that all witnesses saw the same meteor, and that the small differences in the description of the object are attributed to the short time of observation, excitement of the witnesses, and the approach of daylight.
