DRAFT
SUBJECT: UFO Program  
TO: AFCIN (General Walsh)

1. In 1957 the Air Force, and more specifically the ATIC, assumed responsibility for a program designed to determine if unidentified flying objects were a national threat. This program at its inception was designed to determine if UFOs were hostile, and second, had any possible scientific value. A tertiary objective was to determine the nature of each of these objects. With the passage of time, the absence of positive indication that these objects were hostile or had any scientific value, and the coming of the private UFO organizations, the third objective began to take on a more active nature. Today this objective has grown to such an extent that it seems this may be the only reason the program is being maintained. This is damaging to Air Force prestige and has a detrimental effect upon intelligence operations.

2. The attached study offers a scientific transfer of the UFO project to an agency with a scientific capability. I concur with the views outlined in the study that such a move would be beneficial to both the intelligence community and to the UFO program. Dissociation with intelligence would do much to strip the aura of mystery from the UFO program, and the same dissociation would eliminate a project from intelligence which is more suited for public inspection.

3. It is recommended that the attached study be approved and the necessary steps taken to effect transfer of the UFO project to ATIC.
