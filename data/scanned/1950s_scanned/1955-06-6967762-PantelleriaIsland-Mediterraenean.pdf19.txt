The main account was a strange experience.  It happened about 8:15 a.m. on June 20, 1952 on a small farm.  There was a saucer I stopped through.  I had insects on my sweater and as I shook them off, I saw this object hovering at a low altitude making nearly a straight climb, appeared very much silver, no wings or anything visible. It was over in a few seconds. This occurred at Pantelleria Island in the Mediterranean. I saw it with my own eyes and could not understand or explain what I saw. It was about 20 feet in diameter. Visually this was a strange sight.
