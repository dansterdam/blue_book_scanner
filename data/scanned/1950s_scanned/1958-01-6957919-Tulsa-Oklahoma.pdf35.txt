FILE NO.           SUBJECT                Material Examination
TO    AFCIN-452C      FROM    AFCIN-4B4      DATE 8 Apr 58   COMMENT NO.1
Through:   AFCIN-4B3
1.  The sample transmitted this morning for examination as it used magnesium base is believed to be that submitted for examination concerning a pipe line.
2.  The attached X-ray negative was made of the sample first.  This shows a metal tube inside of the sample.  There is a metallic plug within the end of the tube opposite the rounded and of the sample.  Attached to this metallic plug are two wire but only one protrudes from the pitch used to fill the hole.
3. Spectrographic examination of the sample indicated that the sample was probably a corrosion product from an electrode used for spot welding or pipe lining.  The tube and electrical connections to the plug are the normal method of construction for such electrodes.
4. Such electrodes are customarily made from pure zinc, magnesium-base, or aluminum-base alloys.  Spectrographic examination of the sample body indicates it to be of a magnesium-base alloy.
5. No further examination appears necessary.  The sample is returned under separate cover.
