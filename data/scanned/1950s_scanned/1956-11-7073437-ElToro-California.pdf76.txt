NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
Nov 56 to Dec 56
MAINLAND, FLA

I think I should tell you about the two sightings I had of unusual objects. When I was living near Salisbury, I saw a flying object (selection day). When I arrived home just before dark, I noticed two (2) large cigar-shaped ships which I thought were airships. They seemed to be about a quarter of a mile away on the highway which was about half of a mile away. They were side by side and moving very slowly. They seemed to be headed in the direction of our house, so we decided to watch them come over. As they got close--about two or three--suddenly stopped in mid air, then they seemed to drop something around them which appeared to be parachutes, and wobbled from side to side. Then a sort of dangling ladder was lowered, and it looked like a person was climbing down. Then they moved a little further away and looked like one big dark cloud.

It went into the house to make supper, and every now and then I would go out and look at them. The last time I looked it had gotten almost dark, but by this time the ships were three in number and they were side by side. About 8:30 P.M. there were two very brilliant lightning flashes, but the sky was perfectly clear. Evidently the flashes had something to do with the ships, for shortly after they were gone, and I never saw them again.
