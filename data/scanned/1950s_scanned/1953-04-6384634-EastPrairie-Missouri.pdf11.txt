Dear 

Thank you for your letter of April 17. We are very much interested in the distinctive of unusual objects which would like you to make a detailed report.

This report should include a brief description of the object's shape, size, color, speed, direction of flight, duration of sighting, and any other pertinent details. The report should also indicate the time of sighting, and the geographic location in relation to the observer and to the sun if possible, distance from observer and direction of object during sighting.

We would also like to have the names of the other observers and a brief description of the weather at the time of the sighting. Kindly include in this report a paragraph of your own describing what you saw and your evaluation of the observation.
