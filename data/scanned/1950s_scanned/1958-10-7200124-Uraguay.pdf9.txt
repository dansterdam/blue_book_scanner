The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing an observation of a UFO incident.

The text reads as follows:

The statement on the Observation Files can be considered complete. All the details mentioned can be checked with previous data, which makes this a factual statement.

We should point out: 1) the shape of the luminosity - oval disks 2) oscillating movement; 3) ascent and descent; 4) red, blue and green lights that were around the central, well-defined white lights. We have no doubt about this.

It is interesting to point out the similarity of this case to the one that Mr. ______ and other witnesses reported. It can be checked in the CIOYI files.

We must say, though, that some flying saucers have no light.
