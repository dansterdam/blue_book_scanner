explain observed erratic movements and tremendous speeds of supposed solid target. 
Temperature inversions can cause radar beam projected upward to bend down and pick
up objects on the ground, appearing as objects in the air. Other strong evi-
dences of weather return is disappearance of all targets simultaneously. Under
certain conditions, inversion layers can cause interference between two radar sta-
tions some distance apart. Interference can be checked by changing frequency 20 to
40 megacycles, if settings can be varied. All can often be confusing to trained,
experienced radar operators.

PARA III: Specifically, track data submitted insufficient to determine nature of
tracks whether erratic, rapidly changing speed and direction (as is usual in most
sightings of this nature), or whether acceleration patterns and course changes are
smooth. Reference to picking up "3 to 5 unidentified objects at 0830 2" at least
infers that targets not steady, but appearing and disappearing. If true, targets
observed are somewhat similar in manner to unidentified central England sightings,
