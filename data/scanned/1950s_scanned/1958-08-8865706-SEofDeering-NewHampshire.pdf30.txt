Transcription of the text in the document:

"Somewhere over the eastern rim of the southwest region of the center of the constellation known and recorded as the Little Dipper, the lighted object was sighted and observed at the estimated elevation of 60 degrees above the horizon. The halo-like glow, which seemed to be a part of the main object, was elliptical in shape and appeared to be turning or rotating. The object was bright and stationary for a period of about 15 minutes, then it moved and dimmed and disappeared from sight. There is no additional information or description which could be substantiated from the records as a clarification of these sightings, which were on this particular date in this particular geographical area."
