THE BALLOON WAS LIGHT LEAD BALLOON OR SILVER, IT IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST BALLOON, LOST OVER THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AROUND BYWOOD, MISSISSIPPI. ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS.

IT WAS REDDISH ORANGE IN COLOR, VERY BRIGHT, UNLIKE ANY BALLOON THAT HAS EVER BEEN SEEN IN THIS AREA. IT GLIDED GRACEFULLY IN THE AIR, AND SLOWLY HEADED OUT OVER THE TREES.

ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, THE CABLE SUPPORTING IT PARTED, AND IT DRIFTED AWAY RAPIDLY OUT OF SIGHT. IT WAS QUITE LARGE, LARGER THAN ANY WEATHER BALLOON OR SIMILAR OBJECT THAT HAS EVER BEEN SEEN IN THIS AREA.

THE BALLOON WAS SUPPOSED TO REACH AN ALTITUDE OF 125,000 FEET ACCORDING TO CALCULATIONS.
