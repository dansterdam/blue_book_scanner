The text from the document is as follows:

```
NOTE - THE OBJECT REMAINED IN LEVEL FLIGHT.
IT WAS A SOLID OBJECT WITH A TRANS-
PARENT TAIL. IT FLEW BELOW THE
CLOUDS, LIGHTING THEM WITH IT'S GREEN
COLOR, AS IT MOVED RAPIDLY ALONG.
THERE WERE NO PLANES IN THE AREA 
AT THE TIME. I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY
ONE ELSE WHO SAW THE OBJECT.
