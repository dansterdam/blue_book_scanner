STATEMENT OF: PVT. ARTHUR M. DAREX
1 July 52
1010

While observing unusual jet vapor trails with other radar students, I heard the radar, "Look at the stars." Tending to believe that he (Pvt. Dusk) could see in the sky during daylight, continuing blue sky), I had Pvt. Dush direct me until I could see the object also, which indeed did closely approximate the luminous qualities of a star.
At first it seemed motionless, but when I placed my head in a fixed position and lined up the object with the top of the radar van, I could detect a slight movement of the object which appeared to be a small area.  I could not determine whether the object was merely one, or perhaps one of several smaller objects. This inability was due to the minuteness of the object (or objects) and its reflective quality.  Suddenly the object moved from its relatively stationary position directly overhead, and moving very rapidly disappeared to the north.
I have had very little experience estimating aircraft speed and altitude.  I can only say that the object moved much more quickly than the jets and I would estimate its altitude to be in excess of two miles.
