A. Reference to weather effecting radar
The following information was obtained from the weather bureau:
On a weather map of September 10,1951, 10 ser, 1951, a westerly winds, a high pushing out off the coast extending for at least 100 miles north and south of Fort Monmouth area. No precipitation for 600 miles in any direction from Fort Monmouth. A few scattered high cirrus clouds at approximately 25,000 ft. No significant inversion below 16,000 ft. An inversion at 16-17,000 ft of 3°C/thousand increase. An Air was quite moist up to 15,000 ft - no water droplets. No inversion above 17,000 ft up to tropopause (47,000) Temperature 7,000 was - 67°C a total inversion of 2°C up to 63,000 ft. Temperature decreased from -65 to -75,000 rapidly to -3°C. Didn't get good sounding 2200 EST, however, no significant change occurred - nothing that would give erroneous radar signals.
Weather report at 0512, 11 September 1951. Indicates an upper front dissipated in the area West of Highlands. This front carried weak showers which would appear all along the coast (along a line extending from Sandy Hook to La Guardia). There was a very pronounced inversion at 1000 between 2000 and 2500 ft of about 3°C/1000 ft increase in temperature. Within 75 miles of Fort Monmouth at 1000 there were brief showers (small amount of precipitation traces in the order of 1/100 inch). Water droplets 5,000 - 8,000 ft. Stratis 5-500 deep at 10-11,000 ft. Sounding was ended at 12,000 ft. In general cumulus clouds with considerable density were encountered.. clouds with water droplets at 10,000 ft at 1000 lowering sto 2000 ft at 1600.
