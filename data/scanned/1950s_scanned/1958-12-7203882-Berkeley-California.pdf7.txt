The image does not contain any photographs or visual elements. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text on a typewriter-like background. I will now proceed to extract and output all the text from the document.

(3) "I sighted" due to a loss angulation in the sighting. I am more impressed with the many eye-witnesses who failed to give such a precise description of its movement and size. I feel that the great sighting which I considered was more impressive and well-described.
(5) Here again, I am of the opinion that your description, though quite adequate, does not show the full details of the sighting that I was informed about. That is, the size, speed, angles, and direction of movement were not as clearly defined.

I can't say how to the best of my ability in the matter it was observed. I have impressed the witnesses by what they reported to me, but due to its vast distance from me, I can't consider it as much as it seems.

Yours truly,
