Around the large globular object for several minutes before disappearing, becoming a little larger as it neared, appearing disc-shaped. The light object seemed to be glowing or surrounded by a glow at times, so bright at times that it was difficult to look at. It seemed to hang in the sky, remaining motionless for the most part but once in a while moving slowly or wobbling.

We lost sight of it because it seemed to blend into the hazy sky and apparently departed in that direction. The description seems to fit the general characteristics of some of the sightings recently recorded in this area.
