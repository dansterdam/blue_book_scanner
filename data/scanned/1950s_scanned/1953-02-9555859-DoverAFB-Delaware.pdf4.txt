At approximately 2100 on 20 Feb 53 the base Photo lab called me and said that a civilian in House had reported an unidentified object NNW of the field. I went immediately to the Control tower and observed this object through field glasses. The object appeared to be due West of the field and about 30Â° to the horizon. It seemed to flicker in color from red, pink, white, & then green toward the top. A/B Florens G. Whitney was the tower operator on duty at the time and also observed this object. I personally observed the object from 2120 to 2135 on the same date. At the later time it appeared to fade away while I glanced to the 24-19753
