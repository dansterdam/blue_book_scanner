STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED

At approximately 0915, I was called to observe the tracking and plotting of an aircraft flying in an unusual manner. At the time of my arrival, radar contact was maintained with this strange object. I questioned the plotting board and questioned the plotting personnel regarding aircraft's manner of flight.
This plotting showed that it was an unusual occurrence at 0946. Contact was again made and again lost. Contact was then re-established to the south at 1025 and a legible track lasting 40 seconds indicating changes. Contact was again lost due to its high rate of maneuverability and climb.
A further search lasting approximately 1 hour failed to re-establish contact. Operation of the tracking and plotting equipment revealed it to be in first class operating condition. Other aircraft were tracked in the local area with excellent results during this period. All data obtained is included in basic report and photostatic copies of pp-plotting traces.
