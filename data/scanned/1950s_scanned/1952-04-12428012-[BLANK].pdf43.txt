In August 1949 an official report was published that summarized the project up to that date. It represented the final conclusions of all the agencies and individuals concerned in the investigation.

This report covered some two hundred fifty separate incidents that had been reported and evaluated up to that time.

The findings stated in the August 1949 report were that the phenomena did not represent a threat to the security of the United States. This was in 1949, remember, and the report was based upon evaluation of only 250 sightings.

The general conclusions of the official report were announced publicly in December 1949, in response to a growing demand from press and public for an official Air Force statement on the subject.
