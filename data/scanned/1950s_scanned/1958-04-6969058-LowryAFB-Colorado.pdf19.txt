Dayton Air Force Base, Ohio

Dear Captain:

Some of you have had a chance to look through all the reports you receive and have noticed that I find some of the information to be very interesting. It is clear that the reports you send me are hand-written, and it takes considerable time to process them. I am wondering if a typewritten report would be more convenient and possibly result in a faster turn-around time.

From the reports, I have noted several incidents which appeared quite unusual, particularly one from an airman who claimed that a disc-shaped object was seen maneuvering over the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Although this report is not accompanied by any photographs, the details described in the report seem to indicate that the object was of a rather unusual nature. 

I had some instructions prepared for your daughters, but the bear on this envelope may have frightened them. I hope that they will not be too discouraged by my previous communication and will continue to send us their observational reports. I find the reports they send very interesting and they may serve as a basis for future scientific investigations.

If you could obtain permission from the authorities for me to visit your base at a convenient time, I would appreciate it very much. I would like to discuss some of the details of the reports with you and possibly observe some of the tracking procedures involved in your program.

Sincerely yours,

(Signature)
