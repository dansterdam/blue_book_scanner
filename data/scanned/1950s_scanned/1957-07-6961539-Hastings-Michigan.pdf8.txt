Dear Sir,

Would you please send me some information about sighting reports that have been reported. I would like to get some idea of the different types of sightings that have been reported in our country, to see if any of the descriptions match what I saw. I saw 5 lights, as you know, on the 3 July 1957.

Sincerely,
