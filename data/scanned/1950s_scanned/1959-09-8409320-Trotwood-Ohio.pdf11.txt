The image contains two sketches related to UFO sightings. The first sketch shows a curved line and an object above the horizon, with instructions for the observer to mark the position of the object when it was first and last seen. The second set of sketches includes a larger sketch with a person and landscape, and a smaller sketch of a horizon with an object above it. These sketches appear to be part of a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings.

In the text extracted from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
