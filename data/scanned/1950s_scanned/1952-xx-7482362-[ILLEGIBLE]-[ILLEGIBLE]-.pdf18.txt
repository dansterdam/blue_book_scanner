CONFIDENTIAL SECURITY INFORMATION

DETAILS:
1. This investigation opened at the direction of the District Commander, 12th District CID, regarding sightings of an unidentified aerial object by Mr. and Mrs. NEW MEXICO.

AT ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO
2. On 21 July 1952, Mr. NEW MEXICO, Roswell, New Mexico, was interviewed in the Hilton Hotel, Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

About 2355 hours, last Friday night, 18 July 1952, my daughter and I were blick in the back yard of our home, five miles East of Roswell, when we observed a luminous object about 1,000 yards from our home, hovering at about 3,000 feet altitude. It appeared to be elliptical-shaped, glowing object which was about the size of a saucer. It hovered in this position for about 20 to 30 seconds, made a 90° turn to the South and accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object did not appear to make any sound that we could hear. We did not see it return.

Its attitude appeared to remain constant. My daughter and I had been observing stars in that direction for some time previously, and this object was in our line of sight. Its duration of observation was about one (1) minute. It was not a star or anything like that which we had ever seen before. Immediately after the object disappeared, we could still observe the stars in that direction.

3. An Aeronautical Chart was furnished-Mr. NEW MEXICO, which he used to indicate the location and direction of the object. From this chart, it appeared the object was at a point approximately 35° 18' North, 105° 30' West, which point is approximately 5 miles due East of Roswell, New Mexico.
