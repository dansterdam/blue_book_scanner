Case - Henderson, N. C. This report was submitted by J. Edgar Hoover, Chief, FBI.  Dr. Knox arranged for a personal interview with Mrs. (name redacted) and her husband (name redacted), who claim observed the object that whizzed over their car on a lonely North Carolina road just before dawn on 16 April 56.  Further, they both expressed concern over the UFO sighting from the publicity standpoint, and they do not wish to have their relationship made known.  The object was seen for only a few fleeting seconds.  It assembled into a mushroom shape and then disappeared as a boomerang shape.  The observers could not determine the color or size of the object.  The undersigned reached this conclusion:  the possibility that this may have been a hit-and-run incident from the spring meteor shower was being considered.  Also, it was March and kites are quite extensively flown by children in that locality.  The conclusion was also reached that a large top-shaped object resembling a kite or a small balloon descending could possibly be the driver that flashed underneath it, first asking is with their headlights.  However, the observers care detested that their first sighting was with their naked eyes.
