The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document describing a reported UFO sighting.

The full text from the document is as follows:

"The arrows of course indicates the direction of their travel, but the 'jets' seemed to wave about but did not become any longer in size - it did not look like a jet trail as it the arrow no longer. They seemed to be returning, i.e. coming towards the sea coast, and then very suddenly making a 90 turn at high speed and disappearing - leaving no trail in the sky at all. I believe they kept reappearing as if they were on a circular course around the hill or mountain range.

The Navy pilots saw them apparently also. Traffic Control Towers, the materially etc. either from NAMS Holtvile, Texas brought this to my attention, a man in California was 'Craft' with some 20 passengers aboard, that took off from the Churchchin Reservoir in Korea. Our Commanding Officer, Commander , the Captain, watched them all almost that same afternoon when this was reported to us. It was later that our base radar had these effects and that our information on the speed of what we sighted was ascertained.

After about 45 minutes it was watching it appear and disappear from view at the top of the tree-line. It had a metallic glare - that is it had a gray, rather fluffy appearance - it did not appear to be solid at all, but looked as if a gray gas was building up with a metallic content to it, and suddenly it would disappear. The objects were much larger than any we know of today. The objects could be sighted and then suddenly disappear which would indicate some form of 'cloaking' or protective device. We continued to observe them several days afterwards but I have had many reports regarding this incident from the people involved who were career Navy personnel and I suppose many have been left as it happened 15 yrs. ago."
