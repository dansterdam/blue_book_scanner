COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. In the opinion of the preparing officer, the reliability of the observation and conclusions presented herein is limited due to the following:
a. The observers were not asked to submit separate statements because they were not the same persons whose observations were submitted as 2 a.
b. The observers were not asked to submit reports separately because their observations were essentially the same except for a small difference in size of the object.
2. The photo-evaluation study may alter this opinion. (Inclosure: /1/, Part One,)
a. The only possible explanation could be an aircraft, The object was flying low would not be distinguishable.
3. The time duration was in line with an aircraft sighting.
SCORES TO BE EXACT ALTITUDE NOT DEFINITE, THEREFORE, THE GREAT SPEED REPORTED BY THE OBSERVERS COULD BE EXPLAINED BY A LOW FLYING JET AIRCRAFT
5. The three color slides, size, movements, etc., described in Part Two of this report, are not considered property significant, and they be returned to him on completion of investigation.
