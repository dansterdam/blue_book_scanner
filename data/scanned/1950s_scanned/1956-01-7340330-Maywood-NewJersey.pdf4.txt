June 3, 1956.

Dear Lieutenant J. Tilwood,

Sincere apologies for a terrible effort in answering the Information Sheet. As you will see, my education has been far from complete. But, I did try. Also, you will note - I am in the "old goat" category, returning to testify on this whole thing - I repeat, it was a most unusual happening and I was deeply impressed.

Thank you for kindness and interest - forgetting words now - and if you ever happen to be in the vicinity of the farm of my home would enjoy seeing you.

May the best of everything be yours and may God bless you.

Sincerely,
