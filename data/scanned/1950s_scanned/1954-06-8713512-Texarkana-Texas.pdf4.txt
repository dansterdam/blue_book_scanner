Extract from letter report from Ord Corps, Red River Arsenal, Texarkana, Tex, 8 June 1954, to CG, Fourth Army:

This letter describes an incident on 8 June 1954 involving a civilian employee of the installation and an unidentified aerial object. The employee reported seeing a bright aerial object that did not seem to have fantastic tendencies. He was very sincere in furnishing this information. The information has not been released to anyone except the Commanding Officer of this installation.

This incident is submitted in conjunction with an explosion of a reverent in Area D, Red River Arsenal, occurring on 8 June 1954. The explosion consisted of two blasts in succession, with sparks ascending approximately 150 feet. The explosion left a large hole in the ground, and scattered cans and fragmentation bombs were in the vicinity of the explosion. Debris was scattered over Area D and a portion of Area E. Ammunition storage facilities were considered over Area D and a portion of Area E.
