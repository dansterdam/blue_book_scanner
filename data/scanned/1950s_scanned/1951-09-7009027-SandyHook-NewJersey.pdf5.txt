Col T: At this point, may I ask you whether you personally interviewed the pilots?

Maj B: I talked to one of them on the phone, but I didn't see them.

Col T: Was he able to give you any additional description of the object, as to its apparent shape, methods of propulsion, possible construction, and so on?

Maj B: Yes, he said it was a round object, which reflected the sun's rays, indicating a metallic surface. That supports simply my interpretation, - they say it reflected rays - That is was moving in an arc-like direction, they said it was an arc-like movement, but straight, - in an arc, and that when they got approximately 3000 feet from it, it veered, and went out to sea and vanished completely. Now I was told by Lt. Rodgers that he communicated with one of the radar setups in this vicinity, and asked him to check, and he told me that he did not pick up a[n] object at all. Nothing appeared on the screen.

Col T: The radar unit did check during the time of operation and did not report anything, appearing on the radar scope.

Maj B: That as I remember Lt. Rodgers conversation with me, - at the time I didn't make any particular note of it but it has since come up, and seems to be important that I believe that's true. This Colonel, perhaps you'll want to include in those papers as a former holder of that office.

Col T: They are assigned to a fighter interceptor wing at Dover, is that Dover, Delaware? Dover, Maryland

Maj B: I believe it's Delaware sir, but I'm not certain.

Col T: Yes. What is the designation of their unit, do you know?

Maj B: It was 147th Fighter Interceptor Unit.
