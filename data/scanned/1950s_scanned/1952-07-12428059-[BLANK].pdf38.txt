AFHQ O-86, Subj: AFCIN Request for Transcript, General Samford's Press Conference, July 1952 and Other Data

In our opinion, this case was properly evaluated, considering the fact that state side type of detailed UFO investigations cannot be performed at some locale half way around the world. What is of concern is the fact that the report of this incident, as may be noted, is classified.

4. The question arises how did Keyhoe obtain the report? If USAF personnel involved in the sightings are indiscreetly providing this organization with classified information, then the matter takes a serious turn. As an agitator, Keyhoe's "Method of operation" is now well known: through the press, a demand to the Air Force for an explanation of some controversial UFO incident; the press' statement that the Air Force had "no immediate comment," as in this case; and the twisting of the Air Force's comment to NICAP's advantage.

5. It is not necessary to state that time is generally required for press queries to move through military channels for data upon which to base a reply, a fact that NICAP is undoubtedly aware.
