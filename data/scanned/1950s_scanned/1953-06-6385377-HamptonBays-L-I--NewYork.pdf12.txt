MAJOR General John McCormick 
The Pentagon
Washington, D. C.

Dear Sir:

I am enclosing herewith an article which I recently saw and in September 1953, from the "New York Times Magazine."

An event occurred in front of my home in Hampton Bays, L.I., N.Y., which I thought I should report to you. I didn't know to whom I should report it. 

If you wish, the enclosed article, I have added to report the same to you, hoping that any information which I have, will be of service to you. In your connection on this case.

Previous to this event, which occurred on this particular June evening, I had had some experience but since this occurrence, I have opened up again and it is a fascinating but also a terrifying experience, and I can assure you that I am not deciply since very daily.

These are the true events and this is what occurred, in chronological order, fantastic as it may read.

Hampton Bays, L.I. -- It was looking southerly across the waters of Smith's Cove (a tributary off Shinnecock Bay), not far from its mouth.

It was a brilliant (full moonlit) evening. The moon was at the time occupied high in the sky. Suddenly I noticed about 100 yards offshore a circular flat-disc-like object, hovering over the water. It had a flat, aluminum-like surface, reflecting the moonlight. The entire incident was over in about a total of 3 minutes.

Across Smith's Creek about a half mile away, I saw two and a half story house belonging, I believe, to a "Mr. Squires." Finally, this house was dark, as well as the adjacent properties. My own house wasn't lit, except for a night light, as I was "alone," as I was "alone," as I was "alone," as I was - long.
