Mantell was killed. Parts of his plane were found more than half a mile from the central wreckage.

(CUT BACK TO EDWARDS)
There are questions that must be answered about this tragic incident. Why did an experienced pilot like Mantell break one of the cardinal rules of flying: never go above 10,000 feet without oxygen? What did he see that forced him to throw caution to the winds?

After the Mantell crash, UFO reports continued to pile in. During January and February of 1948 the sightings took on an international flavor. "Balls of fire, traveling slowly across the sky" were reported from Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Germany. Then Southern Rhodesia reported similar sightings.
