SWORN STATEMENT
UNCLASSIFIED
22 April 1952

V. C. Maccaull. Wariant Eng., New Mexico, 783th Aircraft Control and Warning Sqdn, advises the following statement:

At 1315 MST, 13 April 1952, an observation was directed to an aircraft, which I thought to be a jet, flying at approximately 15,000-20,000 feet in the direction of the city. The object was something extraordinary due to its maneuverability. It rose rapidly to about 40,000 feet almost vertically, stopped, and then dropped suddenly to about 5,000 feet. It again rose rapidly to 40,000 feet, only to drop again. It repeated these maneuvers several times. It was a bright, silvery object, approximately 30-40 feet in diameter, and without any visible markings, wings, tail, or other conventional aircraft features. I cannot go into any great detail as to its structure.

As I have the approximate path or flight of the object was in sight from my position, but I still could not determine its nature. 

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 22nd day of April 1952.
