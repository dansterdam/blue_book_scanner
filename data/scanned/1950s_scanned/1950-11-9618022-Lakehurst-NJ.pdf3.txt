1. The enclosed report is forwarded to your department for analysis and comment. It is probable that a definite conclusion cannot be reached from the facts presented in the report.

2. The nature of the observation suggests a possibility of the object being an intelligent balloon. However, this explanation was explored when Lt/JG Haven was interviewed by Lt CO's jet fighters had much that the light had a speed range much greater than a jet fighter. It appeared to climb at a terrific rate of speed, even when climbing. The rate of climb was estimated to be over 2000 feet per minute. Therefore, it would not be possible to chase this incident as a lighted weather balloon, if the description is considered accurate.

3. It is requested that this report be reviewed and evaluation forwarded to this Headquarters.
