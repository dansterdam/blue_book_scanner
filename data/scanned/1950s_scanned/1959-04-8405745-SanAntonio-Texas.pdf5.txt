C-BT PA, Lackland AFB,TExCGSN, Subj: Report of UFO
received by the Staff Duty Officer, Friday evening, 17 April 1959.
The use of odd-looking illuminated objects in the navy aircraft training area west of Lackland AFB has been a recurring phenomenon of which the objects observed was probably either a searchlight playing on clouds or an observer in the area seeing a distant cluster of lights. The probability of the object being an aircraft is further substantiated by the fact that many Air Training Command aircraft have been observed in this vicinity between sunrise and sunset, and the markings which can be seen from great distances.
