10. CONCLUSIONS
[X] Was Balloon                  
[_] Was Aircraft                 
[_] Was Astronomical               
[_] Was Satellite                 
[_] Was Insufficient Data for Evaluation

This sighting was probably caused by a searchlight off of an aircraft. This seems to be the most logical explanation.
