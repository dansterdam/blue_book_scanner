Dear Sirs:
My recent report concerning unidentified flying objects that I would like to obtain the official explanation of the 1952 Washington, D.C. sightings.

The official explanation of the 1952 Washington, D.C. sightings, as stated by the U.S. Air Force, was that they were unidentified radar targets. The report also mentions that the Air Force theories indicate the glow was caused by reflections from the jet fighter planes that were sent up to investigate the unidentified radar targets.

The report further states that there was a photograph released over one year later that showed an increase in radiation levels when unknown aerial objects are reported. It also mentions that there has been infrared tracking of unidentified flying objects.

The letter concludes by requesting any information about U.F.O.s obtained during Air Force exploration programs, and expresses appreciation for a prompt reply to these inquiries.
