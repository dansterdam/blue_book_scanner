There are observations made months ago on a strange cloud like object that had no motor noises whatsoever and appeared to be hovering and performing gyrations of a very high rate of speed and made a very sharp turn to disappear from sight.
This seems highly unusual and significant of the performance of some unknown object with physical characteristics and maneuverability vastly superior and different to any known aircraft. Such objects change direction, hover, and accelerate at rates far exceeding any known airplane or other aerial vehicle or object observed. This raises the question as to whether some unconventional developments or performances of an emerging new type aerial vehicle or object are actually being observed or tested over this area.

My observations lasted over a period of 20 to 30 minutes, 30 or more sightings of these objects came across the sky. These objects were observed closely enough to determine that they were not normal planes, balloons, or any known type of aerial object. Their performance was so radically different as to suggest an entirely new and unconventional type of aerial vehicle.

Sincerely yours,
