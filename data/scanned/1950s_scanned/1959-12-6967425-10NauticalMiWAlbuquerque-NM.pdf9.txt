ANONYMOUS OBJECT OBSERVED IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA
On 22 Dec 59, at Oakdale, Calif., Mrs Kenneth Lindsley, age 33, of Oakdale, Calif., was walking in the vicinity of Claral Road and saw an object coming down out of the sky. She estimated the object to be 200 feet above the ground. As she first saw it, it looked was bright orange. At this the object it might have been several inches in diameter. It moved in a straight line and appeared to gently float down until it was only 20 feet above the ground, when it stopped and hovered. It remained there for about 2 minutes, then went back up into the air. Mrs Lindsley said the object rose rapidly and "like a shot" went back up out of sight.

Mrs Lindsley stated it made no noise and did not use any propulsion method that she could see. She said the object was just silent and floated effortlessly up and down. The object was in view for about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Mrs Lindsley stated the object was about 20 feet in diameter and was circular in shape. She said it had a central area that looked metallic, and the outer edges seemed to be of a light transparent material.

The report stated that when the object first came down, it was bright orange in color, but as it hovered, the color changed to a very dull gray. The report also mentioned that when the object went back up, it did so rapidly and quietly up into the air, where it simply disappeared. 

Mrs Lindsley told a news reporter that "it appeared to be something from another world" and that she could not distinguish any windows or view inside the object. After the object went up and disappeared, she waited around the area for a while but saw nothing further.
