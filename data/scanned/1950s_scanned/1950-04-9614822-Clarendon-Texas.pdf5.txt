between two clouds. After this contact it was necessary that we descend due to depletion of the ship's oxygen supply.

It is estimated that 20 minutes elapsed between the time of first sighting the object and losing sight of it for the second time. During this period a constant easterly heading was maintained while climbing from 20,000 to approximately 30,000 feet altitude at an average indicated airspeed of 160 mph.

Two or three minutes after commencing the descent from 30,000 feet, the B-26 reported that they too were leaving the area due to fuel shortage and that they had been unsuccsful in gaining altitude.

Mr. Lloyd Balaam, who was riding in the gunner's station, is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Sam F. West is a graduate of the University of California, and for five years was employed in the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Both of the above observers are familiar with this type of aircraft and are in agreement with the statements made herein. Further, we all agree that the object sighted was not an airplane, balloon, celestial body, or any other object commonly seen above the earth.
