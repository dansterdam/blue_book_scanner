The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report. I will now proceed to transcribe the text from the document:

Dear sir,
The object I mentioned to you in my last call was flying, in a straight line at a high rate of speed, and described a curve as it made a sharp turn to the north. It maintained a constant altitude throughout, and the color of the object was brilliant white. Its size was comparable to a baseball, and it seemed to be glowing slightly, though I could not determine if it was self-luminous or reflecting light. The object disappeared rapidly toward the north. It was observed by several other persons in the area, and they corroborated my account. That occurred at approximately 7:55 p.m. on August 7, 1956.
I feel this object was something other than an aircraft or meteor, and I would appreciate any information you could provide regarding its identity and origin. Please let me know if you require any additional details from me.
Sincerely yours,
