There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet containing handwritten text.

The text in the document is as follows:

About 9 o'clock on the night of 4/8/57 there was an unusual sight in the sky traveling for an east southerly direction. It was on the horizon of the N.E. sky and was heading in an easterly direction at a very fast rate of speed. It was glowing an amber color and appeared to be a large bright object with a tail following. It was visible for about 3 or 4 minutes and then disappeared from sight, going down and out towards the east.

What seemed unusual about this sighting was the speed and the manner in which it disappeared so quickly, and the color which was different from anything I have seen before.
