I was driving home from an appointment with an Insurance prospect. I was driving on Mayfield Road, in a westerly direction, approximately 1/2 mile west of the Monticello Blvd. intersection, heading towards Cedar Road, when I noticed an unusual looking object in the sky. It was hovering in a stationary position over the area. It was an extremely bright object, approximately twice the size of a B-47 bomber, and round in shape. It appeared to be about 2,000 feet in altitude, and was about 3/4 of a mile from my location. After observing it for about 30 seconds, it suddenly accelerated at a fantastic rate of speed and disappeared from sight in a matter of seconds. I was completely amazed at the speed and maneuverability of this object. It made no sound whatsoever, and there were no signs of any type of propulsion system. I have been a student pilot for about 3 years, and I have never seen anything like this before. I am quite certain that this was not any type of conventional aircraft. I turned around and drove back to the area where I had seen the object, but it had completely disappeared.
