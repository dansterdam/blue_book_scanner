The image does not contain a photograph, but rather text from an old UFO report document. I will now act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

(a) TO DETERMINE THEIR ORIGIN, WHETHER NATURAL OR MAN-MADE, IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH INTELLIGENCE VALUATIONS ON THEIR SIGNIFICANCE, IF ANY, FROM A MILITARY DEFENSE STANDPOINT.
