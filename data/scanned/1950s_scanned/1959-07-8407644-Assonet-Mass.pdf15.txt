The image does not contain a photograph, only handwritten text. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text output found in the document:

The left hand went out, and I photo looked, but the U.F.O had left. It hovered a few moments, then went out swinging up the road as my friends were watching. I told them about it, but they did not believe my story, so I did not argue the case with the officials us there.

The CBS television program about U.F.O.s made me realise that the program was too negative in its approach, and I decided to finally report my observation directly to the ATIC of Wright-Patterson AFB.

On #20 the object hanged motionless at all - lasted by object 5-6's approximately 10 minutes of viewing time. The object dissed to me 2 miles high.
