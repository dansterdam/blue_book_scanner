2 June 1953
Description
On the night of 2 June 1953 at approximately 2251 hours a Convair T-29 type aircraft No. 1931 was on a round-robin flight from Ellington Air Base to Shreveport, Louisiana. The aircraft was on a course approximately 180 degrees and at an altitude of 9000 feet. The aircraft was 7Â½ miles south-southeast of Newton. Mississippi, when the pilot's attention was attracted to an object in the sky. The object was observed for approximately 8 to 9 minutes. The object was estimated to be from 3 to 7 miles from the aircraft. The object thought the light was
visible an navigation light and that it seemed to be on a parallel
course with the aircraft. The light appeared to be white in color,
similar to a fleshlite of a city. The object did not appear close enough
to avoid collision. Another time the object appeared to climb, in an
evasive action. After this climb, the object seemed to be slightly
larger than the navigation light. After approximately 2 seconds
the object disappeared.
Discussion
The AFOC contract astronomer states that the object observed was
a meteor. The fact that the object appeared to climb was probably
caused by the motion of the aircraft as it turned to avoid collision.
Conclusion
Was astronomical (meteor).
