The image contains a handwritten report describing an observation of an unidentified object flying over the ocean near Florida. The report states that the object was first observed at 2:13 PM, flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet and crossing the observer's ship at a heading of 350 degrees. The object was described as coming out of a cloud with a bright orange glow, appearing to be a parabolic shape. The report includes a simple sketch showing the object's shape and a description of its movement across the observer's ship.

The report text is as follows:

"at the time it was reported to be at approximately 34 50' North and 77 25' West. We were sailing at 7 Knots on course 334 when 2:13 P.M on unmidentified object flying at course 350 at 35,000 feet crossed our stern. The object came out of a cloud with a bright orange glow surrounding the vessel which was a parabolic shape. I estimated the position of the object to have been 30 5' North by 77 30' West. 

As the vessel moved across our stern in what seemed movements, it gave the appearance of an article or group. The shape of the parabola also changed, becoming larger and more visible."
