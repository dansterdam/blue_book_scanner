III. CONCLUSIONS
a. The unidentified aircraft reported by the USAF pilots was probably a balloon-like object which the airport control tower observed before the pilots arrived in the area.
b. The high speed radar sighting on 10 September 1951 was not necessarily confirmed by a visual sighting of the aircraft.
c. The 1950 ELST radar sighting on 11 September 1951 was a weather balloon.
d. The 1330 LEST radar sighting on 11 September 1951 remains unknown, but it was very brief and due to insufficient information, no conclusion as to the nature of the target can be reached. However, it is felt that there was a great deal of activity of unusual nature observed in the area.
