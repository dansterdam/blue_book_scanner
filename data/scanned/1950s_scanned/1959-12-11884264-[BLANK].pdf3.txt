Subject: Transfer of UFO

MEMORANDUM TO MAJOR GENERAL DOUGHER

1. My comments on the transfer proposed in Colonel Evans' memorandum of 31 March 1960 are as follows:

2. I have been associated during the last ten years of close association with this program to get it out of ATIC, for most of the reasons given in Colonel Evans' better and its attachments. However, I have some additional comments.

a. This program has a high psychological warfare potential (an example being the H. G. Wells "War of the World" put on as a radio show by Orson Welles some years ago). Defense against this is not a function of intelligence.

b. I do not agree that, as stated in paragraph 4c, "loss of prestige to UFO program" is a disadvantage. In fact, I have been trying to bring this about totally.

3. Major Tacker of SAFOI is about to publish a book on UFO. This would surely destroy the claim of objectivity which the Air Force has made.

4. This transfer would certainly ease the 4X3 personnel problem.

5. If a transfer of personnel is involved in this matter, I recommend that Major R. J. Friend or Captain George T. Gregory go with the program; that is, if they are available or if they can be spared. A knowledgeable representative in an advisory capacity only and upon call. A much better alternative, and the one I recommend, would be for Dr. J. Allen Hynek to be retained by SAFOI as the scientific advisor on this subject.
