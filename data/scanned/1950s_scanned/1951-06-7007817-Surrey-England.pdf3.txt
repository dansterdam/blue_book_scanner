The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a letter from the Office of Information, Public Information Division of the United States Air Force, dated July 22, 1964, addressed to Mr. [redacted] in Klamath Falls, Oregon.

The text of the letter is as follows:

July 22, 1964

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is in reference to your recent letter in which you reported sighting an unidentified flying object in England in 1951.

Since it would be necessary to have the exact time of sightings as well as the exact location in the sky and an accurate weather forecast for that particular time, it is believed that it would not be possible to give you an evaluation of the object you saw.

We are inclosing a summary of information on Project Blue Book, the program for the investigation and evaluation of unidentified flying object reports. This will explain in detail the necessary procedures from a more detailed answer.

Thank you for advising us of this unusual phenomena. We regret that we are unable to give you a more detailed answer.

Sincerely,

MASTON M. JACKS
Major, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information
