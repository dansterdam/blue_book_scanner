1. Description of Object:
Shape: Unknown due to high altitude.
Size: About the size of a pin-head held 2 feet from the eye.
Color: Silvery, possibly due to reflection of sun.
Speed: Great speed, estimated as 4 times the speed 
of sound.
Sounds: Similar to sound of a rifle shot, a high-pitched 
whistle, and like that of a rifle during rapid fire.
Maneuvers: The object made three (3) rapid turns as to
be seeking to confuse observers on its direction of 
travel. These turns were made at a smooth and continuous motion, in the manner described below.
(Observer) bore so to the right, followed a second's
pause, then bore so to the left, followed another
second's pause, then bore so straight ahead. This
placed the object back on its original course. This
type of maneuver is very unusual and not known to
be characteristic of normal aircraft.
