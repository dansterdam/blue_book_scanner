STATEMENT

At the time of sighting, the Professor of Air Science and Tactics, University of Georgia (Detachment 160), witnessed a C-45 between Robbins Air Force Base, Georgia, and Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia. Estimated time of sighting was approximately 2030 hours. At 2035 hours, the UHF of the reported sighting was at general clouds covering the area and seemed to be moving away and gaining altitude. The observer could hear it on Channel 5 calling Robbins, a distance of approximately 60 miles, and was comparatively low, at approximately 4,000 to 4,500 feet. It would have been observed by ground observers in or out of Athens, but no flight was scheduled at that time nor is there any airline on any airway scheduled at that time.
