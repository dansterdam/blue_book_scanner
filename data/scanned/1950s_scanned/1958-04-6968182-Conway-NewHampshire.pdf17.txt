ATIC (ATIC - PROJECT BLUE BOOK)

1. Reference subject report and a disk alias submitted to take further action. The slides and photographs were of poor quality, it is recommended that no further action be taken.

2. In coordination with the U.S. Air Force manager service, it was determined by a study of detailed Balloons and Airborne Material data that the object observed on 18 April 1959 was a Radiosonde - CGN-4A (Special) carried by a weather balloon. Positive identification was made, based on April 1959 data.

3. In view of the fact that the description as given is descriptive and its travels slowly was to about the conclusion that what was observed was a Radiosonde - CGN-4A as determined by the data. The object was Balloon No. 6-959.
