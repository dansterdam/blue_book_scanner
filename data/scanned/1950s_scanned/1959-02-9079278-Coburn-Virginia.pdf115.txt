There is no photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text in the document is as follows:

(2) Guided the investigators up Chesapeake Mountain to the alleged clearing supposedly made by one of the UFOB's. The clearing was reported to have been used during the month of March 1959. By the time the investigators saw it, it had grown up with weeds and the trees had filled out. During the early days of the sighting, it was reported, a large group of people were all over the mountain and had camped in the clearing with camp fires burning. The original reports stated limbs in the outer fringes of the clearing were broken and some brush in the center singed, but by the time the investigators got there, the trees had grown back through trampling all over the clearing and probably breaking trees for firewood. It was impossible to tell if the reports were accurate. As of now, the clearing looks like any clearing found in a forest. The three holes found there have also been filled in.

(3) Visited the XXXX family at their home. There are two young girls in the family and all members of the family claimed to have seen strange lights almost every night. We got a description of one seen by them on the night of 5 April 1959 (see TAS C). Later in the evening the investigators drove out on the road toward St. Paul, Va. with the XXXX family hoping to see some of the lights they claimed to see. The only lights visible were car, house and star lights.

d. Tuesday, 9 June 1959.
(1) Visited Mrs. YYYY of Tacoma, Va. She was reported to have been with the XXXX family on 5 April 1959 (see TAS C).
(2) Drove out to Bull Mountain on the road to St. Paul where Mr. ZZZZ claims to see strange lights. The road winds up through the mountains and there are houses in the valleys, and some on the mountain-side among the trees that cannot be seen during the day.
