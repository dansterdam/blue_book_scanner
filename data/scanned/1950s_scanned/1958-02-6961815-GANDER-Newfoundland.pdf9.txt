At 12:40 A.M., 25 February 1958, a call was received from Mr. [redacted], Glenwood, Newfoundland. He reported the sighting of a disc-like object falling from the sky and on fire.

Later during the day Mr. [redacted] called and stated he had visited the area where the object had touched landed and found a clearing 1/4 mile by 1000 feet, irregularly broken and showing signs of having been cleared away in a perfect triangle. The snow was depressed and plowed up at one end. There were no signs of heat or tracks. He also stated that a Mrs. [redacted] and her daughter of Glenwood had seen a long, red streak in the sky East of Glenwood at 12:00 midnight.

Mrs. [redacted] was not available for interview, but her daughter, Miss [redacted], was questioned concerning their sighting. She described the object as a red light in the East traveling toward Gander. A check disclosed the light was seen in the vicinity of the Trans-Canada Highway. There was a snowplow clearing the roads after two days of heavy snowfall, and it is very possible this is what they saw.

While investigating Mr. [redacted]'s sighting, a call came in from Flight Officer [redacted], Duty Controller of the 226th aircraft control and Warning Squadron, at Gander, XXX Newfoundland. He and two other men saw an object on their radar scope on a very erratic course. It disappeared from the scope to the West and they went outside to see if there was anything in the area. Upon further questioning, Flight Officer [redacted] revealed that, in his opinion, this object was definitely a bright star which appeared to change colors due to the atmospheric conditions prevailing at the time.
