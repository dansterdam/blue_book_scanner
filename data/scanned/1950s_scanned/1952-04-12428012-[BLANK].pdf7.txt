```
the climb the rocket motor is turned off and the aircraft, because
of its kinetic and potential energy, continues on its path in a
sort of oscillating gliding flight with steadily decreasing amplitude
of oscillation. Because of its wings the aircraft descending its
ballistic curve bounces on the lower layers of the atmosphere and is
again kicked upwards, like a flat stone ricocheting on a water surface
....the initially big jumps steadily become smaller and finally
go over into a steady gliding flight .... the bombs are released at a
predetermined moment, and the craft returns to its starting place or
some other landing field in a wide arc....during gliding flight the flight
speed decreases from its high initial value to normal landing speed.
It .... is completely independent of weather and time of day at the
target, and of enemy counteraction, because of .... using astronomical
navigation in the stratosphere and because of the height and speed of
flight." End of quote.

I repeat that no working model of the Sanger rocket-bomber
has ever been built so far as is known. But Dr. Sanger is still
living, and still at work -- presently for the government of France.
