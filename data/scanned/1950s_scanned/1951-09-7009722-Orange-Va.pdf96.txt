flights although two of their wives saw them from the city. On the second night only one party thought they saw the object but they were not able to get a measurement. The object appeared to be very low over the city of Lubbock.
A height estimate was made by Dr. astronomer. He questioned three people who saw the object as to their position and the angle of observation. This technique is used in plotting the path of meteors. He arrived at an altitude of between 2,000 and 3,000 feet. However, one of the observers was doubtful as to the time she made observation so it could have been another object she saw, consequently, they are not putting any reliability on this altitude measurement. Two other incidents took place which the group would not mention at first but finally did. They qualified the incidents with the statement that they are so absurd they have never mentioned them. The first incident happened to Mrs. ________, who according to several people is a very calm woman. Prof. ________ stated that she came running into the house one evening just at dusk very excited. Due to her usually calm manner, the excitement was very apparent. She said she had seen a very large flying wing type aircraft, making no sound, go over the house. She could offer no more description. Prof. ________ could not remember exactly when it took place as he had passed it off as being too fantastic. (Note: Nearly identical to 25 August 1951 sighting in Alburquerque, New Mexico.) 
The next incident was observed by Prof. ________ and Dr. _________, and has been titled a "Horror". The men were sitting in the yard waiting for the first object of the evening to pass over the observers. (Strangely enough, there was a remarkable amount of regularity to the flights of the objects.) All of a sudden a group of yellowish lights came across the yard very low, and according to Prof. ________, they had a "wiggling" motion. It upset Dr. ________ considerably, consequently the name "Horror".  Again the instance was dropped because no one else in the neighborhood saw it and it was very low.
