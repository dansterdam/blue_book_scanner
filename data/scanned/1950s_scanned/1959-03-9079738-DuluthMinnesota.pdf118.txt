The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon (skyline) and an object above it. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine they are at the point shown as "A" and to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when they first saw it.

The second sketch contains two parts. The larger part shows a road or path leading to a town or city in the distance. The smaller part shows a more distant horizon line.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you first saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
