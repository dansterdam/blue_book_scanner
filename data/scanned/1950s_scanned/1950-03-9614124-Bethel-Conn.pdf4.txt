The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document describing the observation of three single engine Navy bi-wing planes flying in formation over a woodworking factory in Bethel, Connecticut. The observer noticed a large black "wing-like" object flying very slowly at an altitude of approximately eight thousand feet, and on the fourth pass a brilliant white light appeared at the bottom center of the "wing-like" object before it quickly picked up speed and disappeared. The document concludes with the observer stating "This is a TRUE report of what I have seen in the sky over the center of Bethel, Connecticut, on Monday, March 10, 1950. O HELP ME GOD."

Three single engine Navy bi-wing planes were flying in formation over the WOODWORKING CO factory at an altitude of approximately four thousand feet in the center of Bethel, Conn. The witness watched them. I noticed a large black "WING-SHAPE" flying very slowly in circles eight thousand feet in height to the left of the three Navy planes. The whole underside was jet black. Only on the fourth time around did I see a brilliant white light on the bottom center of the "WING-SHAPE". It circled very, very slowly. When light went on, jet black color of "WING-SHAPE" was hardly noticeable. It then picked up speed very quickly and disappeared within seconds from my view in a Northeasterly direction. This is a TRUE report of what I have seen in the sky over the center of Bethel, Connecticut, on Monday, March 10, 1950. O HELP ME GOD.
