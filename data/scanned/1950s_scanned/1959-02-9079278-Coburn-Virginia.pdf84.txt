The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with two points labeled "A" and "B" on it. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine they are at the point shown, and to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when they first saw it, and a "B" to show how high the object was above the horizon when they last saw it.

The second and third sketches are larger and appear to be examples of how to complete the first sketch. The second sketch shows a road or path leading to a town or city in the distance, with a person standing in the foreground. The third sketch shows a landscape with mountains in the distance and a person standing in the foreground.

There is no photograph present in this image.

Transcription of text in the image:

22. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
