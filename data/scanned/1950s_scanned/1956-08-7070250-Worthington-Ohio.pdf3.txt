RCAF JET PILOT REPORT

A former RCAF jet pilot, now a station navigator, sighted a UFO sighting he had in 1956, while getting a cross-Canada speed record. Chased it for approximately 15 minutes, but lost it when it made a steep climb. He submitted a black-and-white photograph of the object, while cruising seven miles over the Canadian Rockies. The picture is being analyzed by a NICAP photographic advisor, and will be reported.

The incident occurred on Aug. 29, 1956, when Squadron Ldr. Chisholm and Flt. Lt. Hahn were speeding westward. The object "came alongside us from the right rear, traveling rapidly with a fuzzy outline." It is described as having been "sharply defined to the naked eye." A second picture, taken a few minutes later from above storm clouds at 47,000 feet, showed that the UFO had remained stationary.
