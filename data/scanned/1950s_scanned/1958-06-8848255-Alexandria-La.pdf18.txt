The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a disposition form from Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

FILE NO.: AFOIN-M-ASF
SUBJECT: Request, Review and Analysis, UFO Report and Photographs
TO: AFOIN-M-43
FROM: MAJOR BUCKMASTER

1. Request your review and analysis of subject report and photographs.
2. On the basis of a tentative analysis, it is our opinion that the spots (lights) indicated on the photographs were internal reflections of the sun (or some other internal light source) and that the viewfinder on the Polaroid-Land Camera is of such size as to pick up a large area of the sky.
3. It should be pointed out that the camera was pointed due North, the sun was shone directly overhead at that time (1300 Noon) and that the viewfinder on the Polaroid-Land Camera is of such size as to pick up a large area of the sky.
4. Your comments hereon would be appreciated.
