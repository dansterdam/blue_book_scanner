The majority of the personal information provided in the responses has been redacted with black marker. The job is listed as "Airline Pilot", and there are some checkboxes or marks next to options "a. Grade school," "c. College," and "f. Other special training," with what appears to be "Pilot training" written next to it. The handwritten answers for the name, address, telephone number and the completion date of the questionnaire are obscured by redaction.
