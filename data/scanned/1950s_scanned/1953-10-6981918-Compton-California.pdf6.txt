The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document excerpt describing a "Second sighting: 2112 (approx.)" of some kind of phenomenon. The text discusses the details of this sighting, including the appearance of "very dull white lights" and the observer's analysis of the event. The text does not identify any individuals and focuses on describing the observed phenomenon.

Second sighting: 2112 (approx.): Sighted largest portion yet, since about twelve glowing discs or lights of very dull white lights. Low on west horizon, computed not to be over eight and apparently still farther from the observer than the first sighting. There does not seem to be squeezed by the effects of perspective. It seems that if this was the case then each light would be the same size. Instead the formation made the world seem to be flattened. This of course is a presumption but is based on what we saw. 

Since these sightings the Observers of the weather station have been conferring and believe their were atmospheric phenomena though irregular in form. These are all the sightings they have observed to date.

I would like to point out that all sightings including the latest heterodyne observations made by one of the observers with Atmospheric Phenomena All but one (the sightings on 22 Oct 23 as 2002) which is not reported in this letter, were definite sightings and no questions as to confusion with natural phenomena is brought up.
