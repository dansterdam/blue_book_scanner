"9:30 p.m. Police departments of a dozen communities were besieged with calls reporting the explosion which followed as 4 bright flying objects, moving at varying speeds and altitudes, were seen from various parts of the area. The objects seemed to be surrounded by a bluish-white glow."

"Capt. 290, Trenton, N. Jersey, Oct. 4, 1956 - We quote the following: "Yesterday evening at about 8:30 p.m. the Scuddevant is a night watchman at the American Sales Store in Budd Lake, N. J. whose duty it is to guard the building and surrounding area. About 8:30 p.m. he observed four bright objects in the sky moving swiftly up the Delaware River. It came within a few feet of the water and then flew away. The objects were large, probably over 100 feet in length - and it did not make a sound. He said they moved in a bizarre fashion up and down, side to side. Stranger of all was the silverish streak that seemed to connect the objects, she said."

"Mrs. James Farley reported the following: Four silvery objects, according to her, were seen moving swiftly up and down, side to side. Strangest of all was the silverish streak that seemed to connect three of the objects, she said."
