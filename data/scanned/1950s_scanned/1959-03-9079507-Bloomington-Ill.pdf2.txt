Mar. th, 1958,
Il., was a ooking for more on what he saw through a telesope.
He was looking at Sirius branch when he notite what appeared to be a strange object moving along at a high rate of speed. It was heading in a northwesterly direction and was a brilliant white in color. When first sighted, it was at an altitude of about 3,000 feet and was traveling at a tremendous speed. As it moved further away, it began to diminish in size, but its brilliance did not appear to decrease.

The observer watched it for a little over a minute, and he was convinced that it was not an ordinary aircraft. He said that whatever it was, it was moving at a far greater speed than the fastest jet plane he had ever seen.

He could not make out any definite shape or structure, but he had the impression that it resembled a flattened sphere or disc-like object. He said that he wished that he had a camera with him, but unfortunately he did not.

The observer stated that this was the sixth time within the past 18 months that he had seen similar objects in the sky, but this was by far the most spectacular one. He said that he was a confirmed skeptic on the subject of UFOs, but he could not deny what he had seen with his own eyes on this particular occasion.

He concluded by saying that he hoped that the Air Force would have a reasonable explanation for what he had observed, and that he would be interested in learning the results of any investigation that might be made.
