The text found in the document is as follows:

At approximately 19:30 hours on 20 January 1952 I was walking from my quarters with M/Sgt Auridus C. Holm and S/Sgt Robert T. Barnes. My attention was called by Sergeant Holm to an unidentified object traveling below the clouds at approximately 500 feet.

The object was moving at a terrific rate of speed, to and from estimating that it was several thousand miles per hour. It appeared circular in shape and was brilliantly lighted, the light being distinctly brighter than an orange. The object was approximately 3/4 to 1 mile away, and at the distance from where I stood it appeared to be slightly larger than an orange.

The object left a blue trail which was broken. The trail appeared to be continuous like in a comet.

Height of the clouds was estimated by a beacon light on Fairchild Air Force Base. The beacon was projected vertically in a stationary position, the flying object traveling parallel to the earth.

Sergeant Barnes was behind Sergeant Holm and me and did not see the object.

CONTENTS of Preparing Officer:
Since the NCO making this report is a very reliable individual who holds a responsible position within the Wing Intelligence Section, and since the sighting was witnessed by another person, this report appears well-founded.
