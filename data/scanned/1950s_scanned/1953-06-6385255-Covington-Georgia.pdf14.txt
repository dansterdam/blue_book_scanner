The pilot stated that the object appeared to be approaching the aircraft and circling it. The aircraft was approximately 20 miles southeast of the Dobbins AFB area at an altitude of 15,000 feet. No other aircraft were visible in the area at the time. The pilot stated the object could have been seen from a great distance except for the extremely high speed and maneuverability of the object. To the best of the pilot's knowledge, the object had no external lighting or markings of any kind. The pilot did not fire at the object because he did not wish to antagonize it and because he was operating under the Atlanta filter center.

A weather balloon released either from Atlanta Regional Airport or other locations in Georgia contained godown at an altitude of 20,000 feet and double the normal size, and the wind was prevailing from the north but according to the pilot, this was not the object observed.
