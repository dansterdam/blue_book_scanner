Narrative Report of Unidentified Flying Object on 27 October 1952, by Second Lieutenant Eugene F. Balowski, Jr. AC 2
Contacts Patrol aircraft, AF 2,906 air forces on a coastal air patrol at 17,000 feet, and Lt Baldwin, Pilot.
Lt Baldwin, intercepts an unidentified aircarft, the visibility of which was "GOOD". The aircraft's speed was "300 to 240 M.P.H." and its altitude was "BELOW 1,000 FEET" FROM THE PATROL AIRCRAFT.
When Lt Baldwin was still descending to intercept the object, the object was turning and appeared to be "YELLOW-ORANGE IN COLOR" and "12' to 13' IN SIZE". It was still descending when Lt Baldwin gave the order to turn away. After being informed that the object was investigated, the Patrol was instructed not to engage the object further.
Friendly tracks the object from 20,000 feet and flew on a heading of 360 degrees for 55 miles. The object was a single unit, 42 to 50 miles from the patrol, and it later turned toward the patrol and appeared to inspect the patrol aircraft and display his lights. The patrol refused to follow the object further.
At first contact pilot reports the object looked as big as a "FRIENDLY FIGHTER, about 12 to 15 feet in length, long slender fuselage and wings, and a red and green light on the tail, blinking on and off." The object appeared to be a metallic color and was descending at a 2,500 to 3,000 foot per minute rate.
Friendly was heading 090 and object appeared to be heading directly behind friendly for approximately 3 minutes. "RADAR could not pick up the object." Pilot noticed the object disappeared completely and the Radar Observer agreed the object had disappeared.
After object disappeared, Friendly turned and climbed to 24,000 feet. The pilot stated that the object was a "star." Pilot informed that he noticed strobe lights on the object, which gave the impression it was a "star."
Friendly turned toward the object for identification for approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Then the object increased speed to "MORE THAN THAT OF FIGHTER AIRCRAFT" and climbed to over 45,000 feet. Pilot's light was insufficient to see the object clearly and he could not get "LOCK-ON" and told them "that he had a 'VERY FAST' OBJECT IN SIGHT."
Friendly turned away when the object climbed past 45,000 feet. The object was descending at a high rate of speed and appeared much smaller as it went out of sight, indicating a speed "FAR IN EXCESS OF 600 M.P.H." and was estimated to be about 50 miles away when last observed.
