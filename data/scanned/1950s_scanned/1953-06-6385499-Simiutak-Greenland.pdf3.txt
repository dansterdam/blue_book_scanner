STATEMENT

I, A/2c Richard L. Hill AF 11173575, after having been duly sworn, do hereby make the following statement:

As pilot of balloon 1953 and 7 was following the pilot balloon through the theodolite the balloon burst and at its place was a red object. It seemed to be larger at first or second burst than the large red balloon which is about 4 feet in diameter. The balloon was at an altitude of 15,000 feet when it burst. The strange object then proceeded to make a sharp ascent and vertical at same altitude. It made sudden and erratic maneuvers such as a loop. The object was not discernable as to its structure but it did appear to be a definite shape which seemed somewhat triangular. This moving towards the northwest picking up speed rapidly. Upon moving it appeared to be disc shaped and reflecting the sun. It then made a steep climbing maneuver and finally disappearing after five minutes.
