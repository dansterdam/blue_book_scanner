DIG, Hq 164F, AFO 283, 19 Aug 58, Subj: Unidentified Flying Object Report (UFO)
Air Force - Despite the considerable interest of the observer, the sighting was not informative, and a preliminary analysis by the preparing officer of the possible nature of the UFO sighting is as follows. The UFO sighting was not unlike that of a shooting star and pending receipt of any information qualifying the observation further, the reporting officer interpreted the above report as a meteor.
