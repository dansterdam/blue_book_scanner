Mr. Pascagnoula, Mississippi

Dear Mr. -----:

Enclosed find as your agreement two copies of the original film which you loaned to us earlier. 

A cursory examination of the film revealed little of interest, however the film will later be given a thorough analysis and you will be advised of the results.

Thank you very much for your interest and cooperation.

Sincerely,

(Signature)
