Extracted text from the document:

I was stationed aboard when they passed over the large light. They sort of find themselves lowered intensity. I turned it off when I was to get my lessons. The only outside lights were being flashing beacons.
Zorology did not have a weather balloon up in the area, nor did I notice any.
I would not have noticed this object except for the first brilliant flash. The clouds or stars unusual circumstances noted. I do not want to take the time to get dressed for fear that I might miss something. It did not notify anyone at the time of the incident.
Due to the peculiar movements of the little lights, the following shape has been entered to it
