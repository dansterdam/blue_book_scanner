The text on the page reads:

"ANOTHER REPORT: A sighting Item - this one is from Mr. and Mrs. L. who live in Lehanan, Oregon. It was made during the evening hours of August 6th, 1958.

The "fiery ball" was about a size smaller than a full moon, but between them and the horizon. They watched this strange object for approximately 45 minutes and "seemed to be just a large ball of fire". We certainly agree that this highly charged body would be great to investigate closer. However, it is not that easy to accomplish and to appear everywhere in the world."
