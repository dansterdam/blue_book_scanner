According to the sighting, the trails were narrow, formed into a serpentine pattern, and were at a very high altitude and in a northeasterly direction over Goose Air Base.  
2. Captain Matthews immediately reported the incident to Goose Air Base tower operations, but had no knowledge of any aircraft in the area other than the local aircraft he was working at the time.
3. Source added that there was no doubt in his mind that the vapor trails were real, as he had seen them often while flying in Europe during World War II.
4. The sighting of the vapor trails was confirmed by Major R. Hange, pilot of the aircraft.
