Unidentified or unknown flying object sighted
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Dear Sirs,

Re: The Technical Information Center, Directorate of Intelligence, Headquarters of the United States Air Force, Washington 25, D.C.

Concerning this unidentified flying object as clarified and promulgated on 28 September 1952, the object in question was first sighted at 12:43 a.m., Eautern Standard Time, on 6 October 1952 near York, Pennsylvania. The object was observed for approximately 2 1/2 minutes. It was described as a single bright light, silvery in color, and oval in shape. The object was traveling in a straight and level course at a high rate of speed. It was first observed in the southeast and disappeared in the northwest, covering a distance of approximately 30 miles. The total duration of the sighting was approximately 2 1/2 minutes.

All the observers agreed that the object looked like a long cigar with a brilliant white light in the center, and that its course was 225 degrees, and that it varied "tremendously fast".

Additionally and at approximately the same time, a military flight check was made, and several fighter planes from an air force base in the area were observed taking off, but there was no contact or interception of the unidentified flying object.

Your report of astronomical activity tends to believe that what the object sighted was, in reality, some natural phenomenon, and therefore, there is a strong possibility that the item does not fall into the category of unidentified. However, the time, location, speed, and maneuver of the object are not typical of known natural phenomena, and the report is hereby submitted for your analysis.
