The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document that discusses Mercury's revolution around the sun and provides a celestial time table for March. The text appears to be neatly typed and formatted, covering topics related to the movement of Mercury and providing astronomical details.

Mercury's Revolution
Mercury is the innermost planet of the solar system. It revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit at a distance of 36,000,000 miles. The diameter of Mercury is 3,000 miles, one-third of the earth in 88 days.

While it makes one such revolution, the earth also has been moving, so Mercury catches up to it every 116 days, when it comes into "inferior conjunction". Then, of course, it cannot be observed, since it is in the glare of the sun. But in its farthest away position from the sun, it can be observed for a short time in the morning or evening sky. This is called an elongation.
