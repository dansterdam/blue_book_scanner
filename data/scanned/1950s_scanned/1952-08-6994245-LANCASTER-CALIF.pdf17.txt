Subject: Report of interview with observersof strange flying objects,
"Flying Saucers", in Lancaster, Calif. area.

Interviewer: Capt. Paul E. Shoemaker, AAFB

Date, 2 Aug 52

Verbal questioning substantiatated the details set forth in the
attached Sheriff's Office report prepared by deputy W.D. Mallette and
T.M. Morrissw.

The following additional facts were obtained:

The sky was very clear; no clouds were visible in any direction
and the moonlight was very bright.

The objects appeared to be white- yellow lights, elliptical in
shape with hazy outlines.

Size of the objects was about that of a B/####/# baseball.

No noise from the objects was discernable.

The objects appeared side by side about 20 degrees above the
mountain horizon in the south. They then moved west in fomation
at the same time descending to about five degrees above the
horizon. One of the objects removed in this motion while
the other returned at the same elevation to the original position
and then became dimmer and dissappeared from view. The one remaining
in the west descended slowly with a pendulous motion for about
14 minutes until it disappeared below the horizon.

The horisontal movement of the objects was described as, "drifting."
