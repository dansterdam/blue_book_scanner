V.H.F. OMNI-RANGE (VOR)

The V.H.F. omni-range operates within the 112-118 megacycle band. In this band it is relatively free from atmospheric and precipitation static and interference from other radio stations. Furthermore, it is not limited to four courses as the A-N range, but provides definite guidance on any course, to or from the station, the pilot may select. That is why it is called the Omni (Directional) Range. As maintaining instrument altitude the VOR gives reliable indications up to about 150 mi., depend¬ing on your distance.

In flying the V.H.F. omni-range, the pilot uses three basic instruments. The first is the Flight Path Deviation Indicator (cross-pointer instrument), the same type used for the Vasi-aural range (VAR) and the T.S Localiser. The vertical needle of this in¬strument tells the pilot whether he is right or left of the desired course. The second is an Omni-bearing Selector. manually oper¬ated by the rotation of a small knob, by which the pilot selects the course he desires to fly. When the cross-pointer needle is centered, the omni-bearing selector indicates the magnetic bearing of the aircraft either to or from the station. The third is a "TO-FROM" indicator which shows whether the bearing indicated by the Omni-bearing Selector is from ar to the station. Furthermore, the "TO-FROM" needle can tell _i flier when his aircraft is too far from the VOR or is otherwise receiving a weak signal. In this case the needle points to a red sector instead of TO or FROM. In operation, the pilot selects a course by adjusting the omni-bearing selector to the desired magnetic bearing, and then main¬tains it by keeping the cross-pointer needle centered. If the aircraft is correctly aligned with the TO-FROM indications, when the needle swings to the right, for example, it indicates that the course selected lies to the right.

For example, an aircraft is due south of a VOR station. If its pilot desires to fly to the station, he sets the omni-bearing selector to indicate 0°. the "TO-FROM" indicator will then point to the word "10". As the aircraft passes over the station the "TO-FROM" indicator will point to the word "FROM". If a turn of 180 ° is made north of the station, although the vertical cross-pointer needle will again become centered, the "TO-FROM" indicator will still point to "FROM". The pilot, however, will now find that he must fly "Away from the needle" to stay on course. This shows him that the TO-FROM indicator is incorrect. So, the pilot now rotates his omni-bearing selector to 180°. After he has done this, the "TO-FROM" indicator shifts to the "TO" position, and flying "Toward the needle" will keep him on course.

TABLE OF V.H.F. RECEPTION DISTANCES

With the increasing use of VHF and UHF frequencies for communication and navigation it appears desirable to publicize the reception distances for these frequencies. They, therefore, are tabulated below:

Feet Above Ground    Reception Distance**
    Station             Statute Miles
      500                   30
    1,000                  45
    3,000                  80
    5,000                100
  10,000                140
  15,000                175
  20,000                200

•No physical obstruction intervening.
**Based on zero elevation of the facility.

If you are using a VHF transmitter, remember that its effective range increases with your altitude. Don't attempt to contact a station unless you are within "line of sight"

U.S WEATHER BROADCASTS AND TRANSMISSIONS

All continuously operated CAA radio range and radio beacon stations having voice facilities on the range or radio beacon fre¬quencies broadcast weather reports and airway information at 15 and 45 minutes past each hour. The 15-minute past-the- hour broadcast is an "airway" broadcast consisting of weather reports from important terminals located on airways (s) within approximately 400 miles of the station. The 45-minute-past-the-hour broadcast is an “area" broadcast consisting of weather reports from locations within the flight information area of the station.

The broadcast consists of the local weather report and the latest available surface reports from other locations. Reports more than one hour old are not broadcast. Local winds aloft are broadcast 4 times alter the broadcasts at 6:15 and 15:15 A.M., and P.M., E.S.T. The velocities of winds aloft are broadcast in knots - not miles.
At selected stations the Weather Bureau provides a local terminal forecast covering the next two hours. This forecast is broad¬cast, when available, immediately following the local weather report.

Pilots should use the broadcast to avoid, if possible, calling airway communications stations off or about 15 and 45 minutes past the hour which are scheduled broadcast times to request weather information, as such calls may delay starting of Scheduled broadcasts and cause Inconvenience to other persons who are dependent on the broadcasts for weather reports.
