SIGHTING OF UNUSUAL AERIAL OBJECT
BLACKBURN, MELBOURNE, 3RD JANUARY 1954.

1. Herewith report of a sighting by Mr. of Blackburn of an unusual aerial object 1330 hours 3rd January 1954.

2. Your report 7/32 concerning similar objects at about the same time on 3rd January 1954 but it has not been possible to correlate these sightings as yet.

3. Mr. report was made to the Air Operations Room R.A.A.F. only immediately after sighting and he obtained the attached report. The witness was a housewife who was beside her husband at the time of the sighting. She appeared quite nervous and had no previous interest in "flying saucers" or other aerial phenomena. In fact he objected to her report because of subsequent ridicule from his neighbours, who applied to him as "seeing things" because of his sighting and applied pressure Owing to his reticence because of subsequent ridicule from his neighbours.
