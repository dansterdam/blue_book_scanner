NO EXPLANATION

Fiery, Fast-Flying
Object Seen In Sky

West Salem and La Crosse residents definitely reported seeing a fiery object in the sky yesterday, but as far as the U.S. Air Force is concerned, there is no explanation.

According to the United States Weather Bureau facilities at La Crosse, several persons called at about 5:30 p.m. to report the incident. Willard Novotny, CAA official, said the objects had no sound as they passed over La Crosse.

John Henrich, reporter for the La Crosse Tribune, said he saw "two bright saucer-shaped objects," one of which appeared to drop something about 6-7 feet wide, which flashed across the sky for several seconds until it disappeared. The objects, he said, were traveling at a tremendous speed, higher than jet planes usually fly.

The incident was also reported at West Salem, where several persons said they saw a bright flash of light about 6:25 p.m. traveling from east to west.

The officials personally stated they had received no reports of any known aircraft in this area Sunday until 7:30 a.m.

The sightings were from 5:30 to 6:25 p.m. and the officials said they are discontinuing the investigation as a hoax is suspected.
