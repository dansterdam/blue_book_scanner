                                      HIGH NEWS SCENES

PILOT SEES UFO SPLIT INTO THREE PARTS. Captain Peter Jurowel of
the Royal Dutch Airline attested on June 29th that he saw a "glaring light" dis-
integrate into three parts, while flying to New York City from Shannon, Ire-
land, the previous night. "We spotted the light two hours out of Shannon while
flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet. "The light became brighter and crossed
our path in a low arc," he related. "The moon was right up there too, so we
could compare the illumination with the moon. It started bright as Venus and
at one time appeared brighter than the moon. Then it suddenly burst into three
parts, each part still very bright. Two seconds later the parts either burned
out or being lost in the clouds beneath us."
