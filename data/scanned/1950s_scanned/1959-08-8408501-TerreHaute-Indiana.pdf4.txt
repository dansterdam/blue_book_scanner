Dear Mr. [redacted],

Thank you for your letter of March 14 in which you describe seeing an object of unknown origin. As you know, there are a good many reports of this kind and we are not the proper agency to which you should write. We suggest that you write not to us but to the United States Air Force, Section of Unidentified Flying Objects, Washington, D.C.

I am accordingly returning your letter.

Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
