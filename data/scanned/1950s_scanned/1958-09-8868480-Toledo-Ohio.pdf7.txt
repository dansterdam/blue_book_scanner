This document appears to be a request for photo analysis from the United States Air Force Project Blue Book, which was a government program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The image does not contain any photograph, but rather a typed letter with the subject line "Request for Photo Analysis".

The text of the document is as follows:

SUBJECT: (U) Request for Photo Analysis
TO: AFCIN-4E4  FROM: AFCIN-4E2F  DATE: 24 NOV 58

1. The quality of the two negatives is so poor that we cannot definitely identify the object in question. In all probability the image was caused by an aircraft in flight; however, we cannot identify it as to type.
