Dear Sir:

I wonder if you would be interested in a sight my husband and six children and I saw on a day in August 1955.

We were in our car high on a dirt road on the side of a hill overlooking a valley which was heavily wooded.

We all saw it about the same time. A flying object clinical in shape and it was not a plane. It had no wings or rudder of any sort. It was a luminous orange-color and quite large. It was from the distance we were about the size of a dime but it could have been larger. It disappeared into the tree tops on the horizon which was below us. It was going at such a speed that it surprised us all. We wondered where it descended, as we asked about that later. 

We watched it disappear and then drove to our destination which was an auction at Dumbarton. We were in Deering. 

We never reported it for fear we would be ridiculed.

Yours sincerely

My husband, a Major of Infantry during World War II will attest that it was a flying saucer.
