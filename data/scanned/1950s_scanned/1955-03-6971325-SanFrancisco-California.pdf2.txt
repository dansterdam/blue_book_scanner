Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:
We were pulling guard duty at the POF at San Francisco S.F. at about 4:20 am. The bright light about the size of the object caught our attention. At about two fifty a. m. one of the air policemen who had the first watch saw a strange object and woke us up. When we looked at it, it looked like a ball of fire about fifteen to twenty feet in diameter. It seemed to just hover there for three or four minutes, then all of a sudden it took off at tremendous speed in an easterly direction. The color seemed to vary from bright yellow to almost reddish. After it took off, we continued our guard duty and told anyone who came along what we had seen. They said, oh yeah, yeah, I saw it too. Evidently it was seen by other people in the area that early morning. I could not give a more detailed explanation if I tried. The light seemed to be about the size of a basketball and we could see no other outline or shape but the bright light. It disappeared in a matter of seconds.
