Space ships might come from other solar systems

Arguments such as those applied to Mars and Venus need not necessarily apply to planets orbiting stars other than our sun, according to J. P. Lipp of the Rand Corporation.

Many planets outside our solar system may have the environmental characteristics of Earth. The existence of life on planets which have the "right conditions" is not only possible, Lipp firmly believes, but inevitable. 

He assumes, for the sake of his argument, that man is "average", and thus that half the beings on such planets are ahead of us in knowledge, and have reached various levels of space travel experience. Conceivably, an Lipp suggests, among the myriad of other stellar systems in space, one or more races of intelligence beings on planets far removed from our solar system HAVE discovered methods of travel that we could regard only as fantastic. Yet, the greater the astronomical distances that would have to be traversed by space travelers to reach our Earth from outside our solar system, the slighter the chance that space travelers would ever find this planet.

CAPTIONS FOR SOME OTHERS MIGHT BE SPACE SHIPS MAKING ELLIPSES. Space ships coming to Earth might execute several ellipses as shown in order to reduce speed for landing. Drawing is to scale, except that atmosphere (broken circle) is four times too deep.
