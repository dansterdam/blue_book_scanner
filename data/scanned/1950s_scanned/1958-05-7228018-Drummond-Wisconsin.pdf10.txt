1. UFO report and enlargements of points have been thoroughly examined. Currently, our analyses indicate the following:

a. Even under magnification, prints show absolutely no identifiable objects other than those recognized as developing, landing and launching devices, by circles or arrows, which of these were considered as UFOs by sources. The photographs do not show conclusively any unidentified or unusual objects.

b. There is no compelling reason to conclude that the object observed was other than a very bright star; object observed for over one hour, standing still, bright and blinking.

c. There are the three stars of the first magnitude brilliancy in the sky at the time and place cited (V19 = 1.52, V39 = 1.84, V52 = 2.16) ARCTURUS which was obliterated by cloud cover in the sky.

2. Report form submitted does not provide all the EEI's required, as in conformity with paragraphs 15 and 16, AFR 200-2, Intelligence Directive 1 February 1949, whose directives are mandatory for inclusion.

3. In compliance with paragraph 19c of aforementioned Air Force regulation, attached are the prints and negatives submitted for return to the COMMANDER:
