The image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains handwritten text describing an object observed, as well as instructions for the observer to draw a picture to show the shape of the object and any details about its movement or appearance.

The text from the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - None heard
b. Color - Dull Grey, Shiny on top

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object, such as wings, protrusions, size, and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Please show the direction the object was moving.

18. The shape of the object were:
(Circle one): a. Fuzzy or blurred
                b. Sharply outlined
                c. Don't remember

19. IF there was a MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
