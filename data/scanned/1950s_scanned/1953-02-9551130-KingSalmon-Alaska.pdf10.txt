The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a document titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" from the Project Blue Book.

I will now perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document and provide the output:

I, 1st Lt William F. Farley, AC 712 732, make the following statement:

On 7 February 1953 while on duty as observer in a C-47 aircraft (AF 9942) on a routine operational training flight, I observed the following:

At approximately 4:00 p.m. the pilot of the aircraft, Captain Donato from King Salmon, Alaska airport, sighted an unidentified object on the horizon approximately 10 miles away. It was described as being approximately twice the size of a C-47 aircraft and was flying at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet. The object was observed for several minutes and was moving so fast that it was from horizon to horizon in approximately 30 seconds. It flew a straight and level course.

I then interviewed Mrs Marcelle L. Adair, wife of Capt Adair, who corroborated the sighting. From her account, I gathered that Mrs Adair was also observing the object from the ground at King Salmon Airport. She stated positively that the object gave the impression of being metallic and disc-shaped and approximately twice the size of a C-47 aircraft. She also stated that the object was observed for several minutes and disappeared suddenly. She also seemed to be a very reliable and intelligent person.

I interviewed the weather officer at the airport and found weather conditions to be normal, with no unusual meteorological phenomena. The high pressure center was still stationed over the area at 10,000 feet.
