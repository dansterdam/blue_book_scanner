Subj: Unidentified Flying Object Sighted Detroit, Michigan, 2150
hours, 18 July 1958

c. Weather:

(1) [REDACTION] advised that there were some clouds, but he was unable to estimate their altitude. The stars were visible over down- town Detroit.

6. OSI Comment. [REDACTION] who was interviewed at his place of work, was in the U.S. Army for one year and was released from the Army because, according to him, "I wasn't smart enough." His story and description were vague and confusing. He continually referred to his younger brother [REDACTION] to authen- ticate anything he might say. [REDACTION] seemingly intelli- gent and a good student according to his father and older sister, is intensely interested in military life and he stated he intended to make a career of the Armed Forces. When he was questioned as to the possibility that the object might have been a weather balloon, [REDACTION] stated that it couldn't have been a weather balloon because his physics book has a picture of a weather balloon and they have instruments hanging from them. When [REDACTION] was informed that weather balloons did not necessarily have instruments attached to them, he stated that the object may have been like a balloon but he wasn't sure.
