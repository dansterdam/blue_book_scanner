Oct. 6, 1959 - 8:40 p.m. - Madison and I were returning home from consultation at a neighbor's house. As we neared our home, XXXX, Madison, Wis.("NEO"), I sighted a bright light in the northwest sky, apparently moving at high speed. It was traveling from the southeast to the northwest. At first I thought it might be a jet plane with afterburners, but it was traveling much faster than any jet. It seemed about the size of a star. It was very bright and steady, not blinking or flickering. It was at least 4 times the size of the airplane lights we see. It was completely silent.

I said to Madison, "Look at that strange light in the sky." We watched it for about 15-20 seconds as it disappeared from sight, going toward the northwest. The sky was clear, and the object was not obscured by clouds. 

This was a definite observation, and while I cannot give a positive identification, it did not resemble any aircraft I have ever seen before. It seemed to be purposely maneuvering, and was traveling at a tremendous speed. I am quite sure it was not an airplane, satellite, meteor, or any natural astronomical phenomenon. I am quite familiar with all types of aircraft, and this was completely different from anything I have ever observed before.

I would be most interested in any information you may have regarding this observation. Please let me know if you need any further details.

Thank you!

Sincerely,
