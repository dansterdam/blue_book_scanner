AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
F - The objects are definitely not of earthly origin.
CONTENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
The observers are considered reliable, and evidently saw what they described. The witnesses were in view for about 2-3 minutes, and gave a detailed account of what they saw. They were unable to identify the objects and were quite puzzled by them. They kept the objects in view until they disappeared from sight. After the incidence, the observers were interviewed by the intelligence officer, and they gave him the details again as they had reported them.
It is considered that they were in a good position to observe, and their observations are worthy of credence. The objects flew at a very high altitude and speed, and maneuvered in a manner which would be extremely difficult for any known earthly aircraft. The intelligence officer stated that in his opinion the objects were not of earthly origin.
