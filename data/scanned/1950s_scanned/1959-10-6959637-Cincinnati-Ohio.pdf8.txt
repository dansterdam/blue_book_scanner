As described in the questionnaire, I was in my backyard at around dusk on 9-22-59 when I observed a large, disc-shaped object hovering silently in the sky. It was brightly lit and seemed to give off some kind of a glow. At first I thought it might be an airplane, but it made no sound and was completely motionless. After watching it for a few minutes, the object suddenly shot upward at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. This event greatly puzzled me, and I have continued to wonder what it could have been. I have a clear recollection of the incident and am fairly certain of the details I have provided. If you have any other questions, please let me know.
