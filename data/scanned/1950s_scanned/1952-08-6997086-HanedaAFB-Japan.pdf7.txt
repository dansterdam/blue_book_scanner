AF FORM 112â€”PART II 
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 
STATEMENT
At 0001 I was scrambled to invostiagate an unidentified object reported  by a contro1 tower operator at Haneda. The object was reported to be in the Tokyo bay area in an orbit to the starboard at an estimated altitude of 5,000 feet. I observed nothing of an unusual nature in this area, however at 0011H we vectored by Hi-linx on a heading of 320 degrees  and directed to look for a bogie at 11:00 o'clock --7 miles. Lt. Jones made radar contact at 10 degree port 6000 yards. The pielt turned rapidly from port to starboard and disappeared from the scope. I had no visual contact with the target. Soon after this contact the search was aband- oned. I continued to search the Tokyo bay area independantly until 0120L. The weather was 3 to 4 cloud covered at an estimated altitude of 14,000 feet, with excepitions visibility of 60-70 miles. The only known air trafic at this time was a C-54 in the pattern at Haneda and another C-54 over Johnson A.B., aproximately 30 minutes later.

STATEMENT
At 00001 it Holier and I  were scrambled to investigate an unidentified target toy, Tokyo by Upon becoming airbome we immediately took up a heading for Tokyo Bay At 00091, Hi-Inu reported a target at our 9 o'clock possttion. Visual contact made at 00010T with this target and identified as a C-54. We then started a starboard searching orbit under GCI control, southeast of Haneda A. Bb . At 00011r H- Arts gave us a vector of 320 degrees H- inax bad a definite radar echo and gave us a vector to intercept the unidentified target. Hi-Jinx estimated the target to be at 6 ' clook to us at a range of 2 miles. at 00181 1 picked up a radar contact at 10 degrees port, 10 degree below at 6,000 yards. The target was rapidly moving from port to starboard and a "lock on" could not be accomplished. A turn to the stardarboard was instigated to intercept target witch disappeared on scope in approx. ositively 90 seconds. No visual contact was made with the unidentified target. hi-inax was' then contacted and they were unable to give us another vector because they also had lost radar contact with the unidentified target. We continued our search over Tokyo bay under H-Jinx control. At 00331 H-Jinx released us from scrambled mission. The only other aircraft intercepted during this misison was at 0010T. This airoraft was identified as a C-54 on course  of 350 degrees altitude 5000 feet, speed 180 knots. We noticed nothing of unusual nature from this time until we' landed at 01201.
