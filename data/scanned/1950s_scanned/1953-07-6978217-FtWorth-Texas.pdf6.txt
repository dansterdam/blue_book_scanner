"UNCLASSIFIED
17 July 1953

Please be advised that approximately 2315 hours, 3 July 1953, I just happened to observe an object or a blaze of peculiar light traveling in the sky or towards the air within my field of vision from my home. The object appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length and moved swiftly across the sky in a southerly direction. It appeared to be emitting a bright light and had a long trail of light behind it that made it distinguishable as something unusual. The object maintained this course of travel for an estimated 8 to 10 seconds. The object then appeared to make a sharp turn to the right and continued to travel in a westerly direction. During the time that I observed the object it appeared to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed in relation to any aircraft that I have ever observed. After the object made the sharp turn to the right it disappeared from my field of vision. I would estimate the total period of observation to be around 15 to 20 seconds.
