We comment again on this case with a complete and detailed intelligent story.

One significant detail we have to point out from Mr. ________
story and that is that the saucers did not rotate on their axis for he
could see perfectly 2 points under each one, which would have been impossible if they were pivoting.

The saucers had no light in themselves for they were seen only when the lights of the city dimly reflected on them.

Another item worth pointing out is the strange formation in which they flew that does not have any regularity, except the exact distance between one saucer and another.

Our observer points out that all the saucers flew as if it were a solid mass, which suggests the existence of a magnetic force between the objects.

As to the irregularity in formation the best example known is the famous film taken in Utah, USA, and was considered extra secret for a long time. Finally, when it was given to the public, CIOVI had the opportunity of studying it. It is in colors and shows not less than 12 saucers in irregular formation, the same as Mr., __________. Suddenly one of the saucers breaks away and goes ahead, appearing again in the opposite direction and disappearing.

As to the personality of Mr. __________, it is worth noting that the President of the Aeroclub accompanied him during the radio interview prepared by CIOVI. During the audition it was requested of any possible observers to come forward with their information to complete the studies, but nobody did, so we have Mr. _____________ as the only observer of the 7 flying saucers that flew over Montevideo on December 7, 1958. This should not be considered strange as he was in a perfect position to see them: observed in complete darkness in a high place in the city.
