"AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 
WHEN: 31 JUL 53 Squadron, Duncanville, Texas
WHAT: On 31 JUL 53 a sighting report was submitted by this organization. 
APPROVED: 9 AUG 53 
SUMMARY:
- -"APPEARED TO CHANGE COURSE"
- - We observed 15-20 lights as we approached what we thought to be a commercial airliner at about 5,000 feet. They were approximately 1 mile apart, seemed to be traveling faster than normal, and were climbing at about the same rate. 
- - We then discovered the lights were not spaced evenly. They were slightly staggered in several echelons and the formation appeared to be under intelligent control as it "APPEARED TO CHANGE COURSE" slightly as we approached. 
- - We estimated the closest approach at about 25 to 30 miles away and 2,500 feet above our level.
- - The pilot reported getting a very unsual message from Oklahoma City. He had attempted to contact the object by radio but got no reply.
- - Flight to the object was not attempted as the regulation forbids such action. The object(s) were traveling at an estimated speed of 600-700 mph.
