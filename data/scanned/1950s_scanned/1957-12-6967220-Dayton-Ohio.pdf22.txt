The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon, and instructions for the viewer to imagine the placement of points "A" and "B" on the curved line. The second sketch shows two larger images, one depicting a landscape with a person standing in the foreground, and the other depicting a landscape with a curved horizon.

Here is the text transcribed from the image:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) where you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
