The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a project record card from Project 10073, dated December 1957. The card provides details about an observation made near Fruita, Colorado, including the date, time, type of observation, number of objects, course, and a brief summary of the sighting. The comments indicate that the observed object was a "one round yellow, green, red object seen moving SW then S for 45 minutes" and that the moon was also observed in the same area, which would indicate that the object was not a typical celestial body.
