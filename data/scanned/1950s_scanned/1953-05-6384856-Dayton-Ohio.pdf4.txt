28 May 1953
ATIC COMMENT: On the same night as the attached sighting, at approximately 8:30 P.M., two ATIC technicians well versed in astronomy also observed this object. There was no doubt in their minds but what the subject object was an extremely bright meteor which burned for about 5 to 6 seconds on a downward path. According to these sources, the object had a green-white hue. ATIC feels that there is a goodexample of how known phenomenon can cause widespread speculation due to an overly anxious observer. The fact that a meteor sighting was carried in a Dayton paper and advertised as a possible saucer plus the fact that the Control Tower at Wright-Patterson was quoted as saying that they had no report which might explain it, all makes for adverse publicitywhere a known object has touched off a saucer craze.
