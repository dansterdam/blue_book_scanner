Observations made by the U. S. Bureau of Standards show that the radar frequency is an important factor in the tracking of meteors. Radar returns are obtained more from the ionized gases surrounding the meteor than from the meteor itself, and as the radar frequency is increased more of the energy should pass through the ionized cloud rather than reflecting from it. In general, successful meteor tracking has been achieved only with radar having frequencies below about 50 mc/s. Since the frequency of the FPS-20 is over twenty times as high as this, it is extremely doubtful that it would even detect a meteor. Perhaps the ionized "trail" could be detected particularly after it had sufficient time to expand into a larger target, but such a return would not appear as a fast moving object.
A consideration of meteor speeds only serves to discount further the possibility that any of the tracks could have been caused by meteors. During the past twenty years, several thousand meteors have been observed scientifically, i.e., accurate records of their speed and trajectory have been made. Data on the velocities of over 10,000 meteors studied by Stenford and Harvard Observatories show that velocities below 35,000 knots are rare, and none of the observations showed velocities below 23,000 knots. These studies also indicate that meteor trails, i.e., heating of the meteor to incandescence and ionization of gases, rarely begin above 65 n.mi. or extend below a height of 25 n.mi.
A meteor approaching the earth at a velocity of 33,000 knots would have to follow a path inclined at least 77Â° from the horizontal in
