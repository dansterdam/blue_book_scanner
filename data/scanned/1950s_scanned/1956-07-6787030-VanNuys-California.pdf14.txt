Subject: Request for Analysis - Turf Allegedly Burnt by "Flying Saucer" (Continued)
TO: AFOIN-4E2c (G. A. Hangle)  FROM: AFOIN-4X4 (Howard G. Gross)  DATE: 7 Feb 57  COMMENT NR 3 (Continued)

Sampled: The metal contents of various crude oils does not seem to explain the presence of cobalt in the charred sample as a residual from burning of a material. It is indicated that cobalt in the present in most crude oils in an order of magnitude greater than for cobalt, and these metals were not observed either to differ in the two samples or to be present in so large an amount as was indicated for cobalt in the charred sample.

If the charred sample were taken in an area where trash containing some cobalt glass had been dropped, cobalt in the amounts found might be possible.

The lead content in the charred sample might have occurred as a result of spraying of the sampled area using an insecticide such as arsenate of lead or by the burning of a lead-containing fuel such as leaded gasoline. No indications have been found of normal lead compounds in the amounts observed in this charred sample examined.

This comment is considered to have fulfilled the request of Comment Nr 1 dated January 18, 1957. The portions of the samples remaining are enclosed herewith.
