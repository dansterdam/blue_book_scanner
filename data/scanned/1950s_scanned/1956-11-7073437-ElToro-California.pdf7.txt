AF FORM 112â€”PART II
UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. 10-0703-L-56
ASSIGNER OB-157-56
FLIGHT: 1-6, 46020 AISS
AT 2130 or shortly after, on 11 November, 1956, a red blinking light appeared above the lower mountain range directly North of MCAS El Toro. USPO and MEE observers both sighted the object. The light glared (2200) 3 times, was on for short periods of time, 20 seconds or so, then went off. Just as the light went off, I sighted an object directly above and behind the light. This object remained on for 4 or 5 minutes and appear to have a tail and emitted a target 6 miles North of the station. From while the object on for time on the radar scope, and spotted the target 6 miles North of the station, this indicates that the object must have been approximately one to five or six miles wide (about one to five or six miles). The object then disappeared from radar. After the first sighting, I continued to watch the object with my naked eyes and with x10 binoculars. From while I was watching, the object remained in view for 4 miles south, then blinking on the station till reaching four miles South, then disappearing behind the station. This sighting is confirmed by four other targets (believed to be the same object) following the same course.
