GOSSAMER FALL HERALDS SAUCER WAVE

In view of the good evidence in the preceding item that "gossamer" may properly be identified with the small, silvery discs which again occurred in the vicinity of New Mexico, on October 27-28, 1957. Levelland, Texas, the scene of UFO landings ten days earlier only confirms the identification aspect. The sequence of phenomena leading up to the October 27-28, 1951 was likewise ushered in by "angel's-hair falls." Our source for the details is the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena.

The cobweby strands, apparently falling from a great height" and up to 50 feet long, have been a recurring phenomenon coincident with the appearance of the saucer craft in incredible numbers and size. All over the world, enormous quantities of this lint-like substance have been observed as falling from the sky, some of it heavier south of here than in Portales, to all the way to Massachusetts. Ostensibly, not a soul had ever heard of "gossamer falls," and an extraordinarily detailed account of the strange phenomenon is given in the press as an uncorroborated "mystery." This "explanation" was syndicated from the country beyond the border, by those who know all the answers, as Amherst College biologists, offered the spider-web explanation tentatively, without examining the material. The Newton Investigations Committee insists that the botchy did the men in the shower due to "spiders." The only corroboration: Airmen at Cannon Air Force Base reported they found tiny spider strands.
