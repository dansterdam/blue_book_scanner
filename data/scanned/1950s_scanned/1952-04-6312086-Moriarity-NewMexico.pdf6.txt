I, Captain _______, Aircraft Control and Warning Station, Moriarty, New Mexico, do hereby wish to make the following statement:
At 0:42 a.m., 30 April 1952, the _______ on duty, A/2C _______, received a report of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) near Moriarty, New Mexico. I was immediately notified and I visually observed the objects approximately 5 miles east of Moriarty at an approximate altitude of 12,000 feet. The objects were approximately 30 feet in diameter and were traveling at a speed of approximately 600 mph. I immediately notified the 2nd Air Division Office at Kirtland Air Force Base and the objects were still visible in the next 20 minutes when the BIP was again at 23:00 o'clock and at a range of approximately 26 miles from my position. The objects appeared to have completed approximately 2 revolution or turns per minute and would disappear intermittently for periods of 2-5 seconds and then reappear in the same general area. The objects appeared to be very brightly illuminated and were not blurred in any manner, which can only be described as the type of light that is different from the normal type one sees. The maneuvers of the objects was very impressive. 
Attached hereto is the approximate path of flight the trip was in as I saw it.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 30 day of April 1952.
