AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Det #3, 1006th AISS
1. DESCRIPTION OF SOURCE: Mr. JAMES X. SOUCEK, United States citizen, 19, resident of MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., and student at LOS ANGELES CITY COLLEGE, University of CALIFORNIA, at LOS ANGELES. SOUCEK stated that he had been interested in theories of flying saucers (or "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS") for some time and had been an active member of a flying saucer club UFON CLUB) located in CALIFORNIA and "NICAP" (a UFON CLUB).
II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE: The interviewer attempted to judge SOUCEK's reliability and believability. SOUCEK described himself as familiar with "flying saucer" theories and stated that he had worked at the airport and studied some engineering. However, the interviewer began the interview by stating that SOUCEK's claims were initially difficult to evaluate and must be subjected to verification.
The interviewers felt that SOUCEK was telling the truth as he knew it, but they added that in their opinion the object he claimed to have seen was more likely an aircraft than a "flying saucer" or UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT. Soucek's opinion differed from the interviewers' opinion. Soucek's description of the object was vague and general, and the interviewers could find no other witnesses to corroborate his statements. The interviewers concluded that SOUCEK's reliability was open to question.
III. REPORTED SIGHTING: SOUCEK stated that on 9 May 1958, at about 2145 hours, while driving north on HIGHWAY 101, five lights were observed approximately 3 miles west. He described the lights as four amber-white, followed by one blue-green light. The lights were in a close formation and appeared to him to be aircraft (PIPER type) flying in the same direction as the highway. SOUCEK said he could hear no sound. He said the weather was clear. He stated that the lights were at about 2000 feet altitude and made no abrupt maneuvers. SOUCEK observed the lights for approximately 10 minutes, using field glasses and a telescope. He believed the lights were vehicles moving through the air and not any unusual air or space phenomena.
