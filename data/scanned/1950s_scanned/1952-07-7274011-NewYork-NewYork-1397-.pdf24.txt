Mr. Porter:

The original report with the data and the
attached list is forwarded herewith.

The sighting was reported by two observers--one
a cook and the other a bar tender. According to
their story, they were both outside their place of
business at about 9:20 PM on 7 July 1952, when
they noticed an object in the sky moving in an
easterly direction. They described the object as
being round, silvery in color, and giving off a
bright light. It appeared to be about 2 or 3 times
the size of a star and seemed to be at an altitude
of approximately 1,500 feet. The object moved
across the sky at a rapid rate of speed and then
suddenly disappeared. The observers stated that
they had observed a similar object about 2 weeks
prior to this sighting.

I am forwarding this report for your information
and appropriate action.
