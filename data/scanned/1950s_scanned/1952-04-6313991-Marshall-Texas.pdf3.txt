There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a handwritten document, likely an old UFO report from Project Blue Book.

Dear Sir:
This incident of the saucer peak than Manmade from Marshal Texas can be dated up to this day and hour as an unexplained aerial object phenomenon.
The subject was observed by myself this evening at approximately 7:30 P.M. central time as a bright luminous green object, egg-shaped in form, moving silently and at a high rate of speed at an estimated altitude of around 10,000 feet. The speed was approximately 1,000 miles per hour or greater. This object was observed for a period of approximately 60 seconds before disappearing from view at a point high in the western sky. The object did not leave a trail and did not appear to be an airplace, meteorite, or any other known aerial object.
To the best of my knowledge this incident is unexplained and should be thoroughly investigated as a legitimate unidentified flying object phenomenon.
