I think when it comes time for a man's vacation and he waits for over 20 days whenever he has a legitimate excuse to leave, death in the family and he stays on the job terminate about going home he has a perfect right to be. Certainly 6 months plus on a hundred square miles island living on some of the early conditions under which we lived also is a very excellent reason for getting off the rock. As a matter of fact I'm not so old I don't go like the women. Of course we have a few characters around in some of the companies I don't know what they do like. I see that it a portion of another tape is going to be required so I will briefly try to cover some highlights and elaborate on them on the following tapes. While on Ascension Island I was insulted a number of times in a of ways which were of such a nature that they would have been lasted with security people. We didn't never/any security people on the island. We simply had a Pan American Chief, A Fire Chief, you might say a guard. Some of these were just about more than a man could take. Some few people working for BGA and the Air Force, one or two Pan American people said some mighty insulting things to me. I have been called dirty son of a bitch, traitors and everything else. Now for a man who has served his country a man who has never been arrested or a man who has never been in trouble with the law these are some pretty rough.
