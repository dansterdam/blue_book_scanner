At approximately 2105 DST I was sitting on the front porch at 11 Old Main Road, Chanute Gardens -- I was leaning back on my elbows watching the sky where a small light from a weather balloon had been shining. Suddenly I observed to my right a brightly lighted object traveling at a tremendous speed. It appeared directly above Hanger #IV, and stationary.

It began to move almost immediately, to the right (west), and disappeared in approximately three (3) seconds. It was dark red in the center, with a strange tint around the edges. As it began to move, it accelerated at a tremendous rate, and appeared to almost instantly up. There was a faint color trail behind the object as it accelerated, giving it the appearance of a comet.
