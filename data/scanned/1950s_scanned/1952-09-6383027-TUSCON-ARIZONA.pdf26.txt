Transcription of the text:

As to 23:30 on the night of September seventh, 1952, my wife and I were sitting outside our house at _____, when suddenly we saw a cherry orange colored object appear in the Northwest sky. This object or light, flashed on in much the same way as a flashy, and seemed to be about the size of a small automobile. The object was at an angle of 22 degrees from the ground, and by estimating its distance as a triangle, I figured the object to be at an altitude of 5000'. The object remained motionless, and in fifteen or twenty seconds it suddenly disappeared. Its particular color would be equivalent to a flame temperature of approximately 3300 degrees Fahrenheit. The object was then shaped about twice as long as it was wide, and did not change in size, color, or brilliance. I understand it did not throw any shadows, or make any noise.
and there was no sound to the loss of my knowledge this object could not possibly be explained by the presence of any conventional aircraft, but it comes to me that it could possibly be due to the formation of city lights.
I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
