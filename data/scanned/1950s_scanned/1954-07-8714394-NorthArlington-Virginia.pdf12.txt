11. In July, 1954, two Air Force pilots bailed out of 
a F-94C type aircraft, which crashed in Walesville, 
N.Y. (I think) and killed four persons (July 2). Mr. 
Keyhoe mentions that their cockpit became unbearably 
hot as they were chasing a UFO, and they left their 
aircraft as a result of this heat. Although Mr. 
Keyhoe made no mention of fire, this seems a likely 
answer. What is the Air Force Answer?

The July 1954 P-96C type aircraft accident you mentioned is not 
contained in Air Force UFO files.

Case 2.-A jet fighter returning from a "scramble" to 
investigate an "unidentified aircraft," plunged 
into tiny Walesville eleven miles southwest of 
Utica, about 12:30 p.m., July 2, 1954. The plane 
crashed into an auto and two buildings killing 
four persons....The Air Force in Washington 
announced the F-94C Starfire had been sent up on 
"an air defense intercept mission." 
According to the U.P. release of July 3, "Air 
Force spokesman said the cockpit of the plane 
became "unbearably hot" during the flight and 
that the pilot ordered his radar observer to 
bail out, then bailed out himself at 7000 .... 
.... .... Then according to A.P., release in the 
New York Times July 3, "The Griffiss AFB said, 
that fuel in the burning plane apparently had 
exploded when the jet crashed. They said it had 
not been determined whether an explosion occurred 
while the jet was in the air,...also I learned 
that the jet had successfully contacted the UFO 
but still could not identify it....a Mohawk 
Airlines pilot estimated the altitude of the 
object at about 20,000 ft. He said he "saw a 
light apparently shining from it.
