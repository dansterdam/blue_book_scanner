Text extracted from the document:

She called to her husband who also saw the object, but could not identify it. About five minutes later she looked for the object again, and found that it had shifted its position in a westerly direction. She does not remember seeing the moon even though she did look for it. She describes the sky as clear.  The object did not seem to be the source of the light which illuminated the room. According to the witness, the object was 2 inches wide at a distance of 14 inches.

By using similar triangles the size of the object was estimated to be about 22 feet in diameter. Her first estimate was 12 feet, but later she said that it appeared about 1/3 the length of her front yard, which is 65 feet, from house to street. This would confirm the 22 feet figure.

On the same morning, about 2 am, a Mrs. Lorain, watched a "big red ball" moving outside her window. See fig. 5. The object made a low pulsating sound which made the witness "sick to my stomach." She thought at first that the light was due to a train or possibly a truck. A railroad runs one block north of the house. The witness was lying in a bed, with her head about 15 feet from the window, which is two feet across, and she said that the object took up the entire width of the window. When it appeared nearest to the window the witness thought it was giving off heat. The sound connected with the object diminished and decreased as the object advanced and receded. An examination of the trees outside the window disclosed nothing peculiar, even though the object must have passed through some light branches. The witness thinks she heard a crashing sound when the object first appeared.
