The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document from Project Blue Book, dated July 22, 1952, describing a UFO sighting that occurred in Uvalde, Texas.

The text in the document is as follows:

12. 22 July 1952, Uvalde, Texas. 
This is an interesting case, with two witnesses who are thoroughly familiar with planes, weather balloons, etc. 
Objects discovered are approximate 100 degrees in 45 seconds, had no visible aerodynamic features, had a bright afterglow and a gyrating movement. No sound. Object seemed to climb higher every second and move from in front of a cumulus cloud to in back of it. This object giving some evidence of distance. Object observed in thorough investigation since there were two adult witnesses and one 16-year old witness. It must be classed as unknown. I have rated it as a 2 C.
