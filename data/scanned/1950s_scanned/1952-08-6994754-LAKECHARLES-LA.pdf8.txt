The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document contains a handwritten "Statement of Fact" describing an incident that occurred around 12:30 AM on August 12, 1952. The text describes the witness's observation of a "round shaped object" from the front seat of their car, which appeared to be traveling from north to south at a high speed. The object was observed for about 2-3 seconds and then disappeared. There is no photograph included in this particular document.

Text from the document:

About 2:00 O hours, 12 august 1952, I returned home from town with my wife. About 1/2 mile to drive next to home I spotted a round shaped object from the front seat of my convertible with the top down. It was traveling from north to south at a high speed. I observed it about 2-3 seconds. I estimated its size to be about 20-30 feet. I observed no sound, no means of propulsion, no exhaust, no trail. After about 15 seconds the object disappeared due to distance. There was no sound, no observation of landing, take-off or maneuvering.
