               BRILLIANT OBJECT STARTLES MONTANA RESIDENTS: Five peo-
ple living in the Brown's Gulch district of Montana reported that on the night 
of April 5th, at about 9:30 p.m., they saw an extremely bright object which 
seemed to be in the sky near their house. Mrs. Victoria Gabrielli, her son 
Victor Gabrielli, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Mitchell and Mrs. Mary Baxendale were
gathered in the Gabrielli residence watching television, with the house part-
ially darkened, they said, when the phenomenon occurred. "It lit up the whole 
house," Mrs. Gabrielli said. "The television blacked out at the same time. We
thought it was a crashing plane or some kind of explosion, but there was no 
noise. The television came on again in a few seconds." The Civil Aeronautics 
Administration offices at the local airport said no unusual objects in the sky 
had been logged or reported at its office that night, and that there were no 
plane crashes in the area.
