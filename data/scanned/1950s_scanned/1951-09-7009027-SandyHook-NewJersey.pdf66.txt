Reference paragraph 2 stating on 10 September 1951, 1515 hours AMCR 584, shortly before the track-target, etc. It is given an A-l evaluation, that this radar observed a balloon target at 32,000 feet altitude, accompanied by an officer of the Student Attachment to determine the altitude in order to establish who was a pool concerning what the altitude of the balloon which is sighted might be. The pool was formed by several officers at a risk of $1 a head concerning this target. It is a significant feature here which ties in later with the discussion of balloons.

Paragraph 3: On 11 September 1951 at 1030 hours, two SCR 584 serial sets 217 and 212 picked up the same target at a range of 100 to 300 miles of 30,000 yds. etc. The interesting feature of this sighting is that it was observed by MIT which was a radar to investigate.

The document further mentions Mr. Meyer the instructor previously mentioned and Pvt Mason, the MIT graduate, previously mentioned. Pvt Mason and a crew of two other men were training in a radar set which was in operation at the particular moment just prior to the signal received at 1030 hours. The instructor, Mr. Meyer, was involved in this incident.
