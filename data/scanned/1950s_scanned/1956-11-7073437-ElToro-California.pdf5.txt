AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Flight No. 45020 ATIS
From: El Toro, California

Report No. ISS-UFO(BSI-56-9-17 

The report states that on 7 November 1956, the Officer in Charge of the Station Rescue Unit, Captain L.H. Schleutsker, sent a request for a photographer and an order to investigate an alleged sighting of numerous aircraft at the station. 

In the ensuing hours, sources reported that numerous aircraft were observed over the station. The report indicates that the objects were described as silvery, circular, and appeared to be flying in a loose formation. The report notes that the objects were observed as they passed over the station, but with repeated failures to intercept them. The helicopters and fighters pursuing the objects were reportedly unable to get close enough to identify them specifically.

The report further states that one of the objects flew formation with the helicopters and fighters for a short period of time before departing at a very high speed.

The report discusses the difficulty the helicopters and fighters had in attempting to intercept the objects, noting that they were not able to close the distance or identify the objects specifically. It mentions that the fighters were able to establish radar contact with the objects, but were unable to reach them.

The report indicates that the radar sets in use were US Navy CPS-6A units, operating at a frequency of 2900 Mc, and that the objects were detected at ranges up to 55 miles.

The report concludes by noting that there had been recent maintenance difficulties with either equipment or the efforts of anomalous propagation, and that the station commander stated that the station's propagation had been observed to be extremely distorted during the time of these observations, making conventional identification and classification of the objects beyond the capability of modern aircraft.
