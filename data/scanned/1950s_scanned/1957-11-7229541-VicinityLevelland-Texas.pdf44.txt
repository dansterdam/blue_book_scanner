Stormy Weather in Texas

The new type of UFO with electromagnetic (E-M) powers first attracted notice in this country by Hasting's appearing near Levelland, Texas, on the night of November 2, 1957. A number of persons reported seeing a large lighted object or small engine near a powerline "as large as a baker's bread pan" (30-foot diameter, 15-20 feet thick; some reports give two objects). The object was about sixty miles from Plainview, site of a famous meteor shower and only twenty-four miles from Lubbock (where a few years earlier had occurred the celebrated Lubbock Lights incident) (80 m.p.h. to 800 m.p.h.).

The region is normally an arid one, but at the beginning of November it was experiencing unusually warm weather - actual storms and rain for several days. About 4:45 that Saturday night, a farmer named Pedro Saucedo (or Saturday) with his friend J. C. Bales Caraveo were returning home from Levelland. A few miles northwest of the town he had turned off Route 116 onto a side road, when both men noticed a brightly lighted object sitting on the road. Saucedo immediately stopped the car, and both men got out and continued observing the object, drawing and talking until suddenly the engine died and the lights went out. While trying to restart the motor, Saucedo (the similarity between "Saucedo" and "saucer" presents a deceiving coincidence) glanced over his left shoulder, something that told him quickly to duck. A veteran of combat in Korea, Saucedo reacted instantaneously as he described it, dropping to the ground. As he downturned, he felt the object strike the car and hit the dirt (because he was afraid I called to Joe but he didn't get out). The thing passed within a few feet of our heads and a rush of wind blew us, he said. I felt a lot of heat."

Crawling out and seeing the object disappear in the direction of Levelland, he restarted the engine and drove back to town to notify the sheriff.

The sheriff was soon receiving reports from other persons who had been driving in the same area at about the same time. They said that they, too, had seen a blazing object which they described as a "ball of fire" sometimes described as "fire-ball". Their stories tallied with Saucedo's, and then repeated one after another, the object had disappeared. A number of townspeople telephoned the authorities to report a bright flash or the lights on their cars and trucks "going out suddenly" - some gave the impression they had near collisions with the object, though no accident had in fact occurred.

Under headlines such as "Mystery Object Stalls Autos in West Texas", these stories hit newspapers all over the nation. The newspaper accounts were not calming. Newspapers in New Mexico were relating that they, too, had seen fiery objects and flashes of light in the sky before An amazingly large number of citizens seem to have been out late that stormy Saturday night, perhaps afraid to go to bed as rumors spread about unusual electric disturbances and the crash that was reported.

For days the Russian satellites had to share the spotlight with the claims that the Russians were actually sending over small pilotless craft to test the American countryside. Some of the accounts were embellished with claims a big light, an egg-shaped object 50 to 60 feet long lighted up as though a landing or takeoff was in progress. Others, like Saucedo's, bluntly described the object as something "torpedo-shaped" "like a rocket, but much larger," and that lights on the object had seemed to be switching on and off [...]]. One look has since been described as a bluish-green glow, and it appeared 30 to 30 feet long. It had a bluish-green glow, and it appeared about 40 to 50 feet long. "It had a bluish-green glow, and it appeared 30 to 50 feet long." Those who wanted to believe in flying saucers easily ignored the discrepancy between the "flaming ball" or "fiery tornado" originally described by Saucedo, and a bluish-green torpedo.

For days the Russian satellites had to share the spotlight with the claims that the Russians were actually sending over small pilotless craft to test the American countryside. Various verifying tests with E-M meters at Levelland were reported. For days newspaper accounts of these bizarre stories insisted that the Institute of Meteorites in New Mexico suggested that the objects seen at Levelland might have been fireballs. A reporter assigned to the story said he would return a report "as soon as I can get back" but no report appeared to confirm the Institute's analysis.
