PART 2
HISTORY

Aerial phenomena are not new. For some three hundred years now,
men have seen in the sky, at one time or another and in one place or
another, almost everything imaginable. Newspaper files are filled
with reports of strange objects, lights, and ether phenomena seen by
reliable witnesses -- but never adequately explained -- over the years.

But let as skip lightly over a few hundreds of years, and take
up our more recent experiences in the field.

The present era -- if one may call it that -- of the un-
identified objects began in June of 1947 when a man named Kenneth
Arnold, a business man of Boise, Idaho, reported seeing from his
private plane a chain of nine saucer-like objects near Mr. Ranier
in the state of Washington. Mr. Arnold's report set off a sort of
chain-reaction of similar reports. I think we need not dwell here
on that period -- as newspaper readers, you are all probably quite
familiar with it. What I would like to review briefly, is the
action taken by the Air Force and the result of it.
