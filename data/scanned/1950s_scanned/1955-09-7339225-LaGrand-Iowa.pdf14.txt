SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

ORIGINATIN6 AGENCY                   REPORT NO.
Flight 2-A, 46620 AISS               2A-AUG-3-55

1. This UFO was assigned to this Unit for investigation by Hq, 46620D AISS. The initial report was obtained from the D/I 31st Air Division.

2. A thorough check was made of all research agencies in the Minneapolis area. There were no balloons from any of these agencies over Iowa at the time of the sightings. It was also noted that balloons from these agencies are launched only at a definite rate and on regular schedule, and none of these balloons were of the type or size to have been sighted. A further investigation brought out the fact that the lights observed in the air balloons were of the type employed on the wind type of aircraft and could not be observed from the ground if the balloons were over 10,000 feet away.

3. The U. of Minnesota Observatory found nothing in their logs to indicate anything unusual on the night of the sightings.
