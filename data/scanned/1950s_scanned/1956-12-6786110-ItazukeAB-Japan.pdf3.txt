The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document with text describing an incident involving two USAF jet pilots practicing ground radar interceptions and encountering a strange radar blip that was estimated to be at least 20 miles away. The text provides detailed descriptions of the incident, including how the pilots' instruments showed the object was closing in on them, the various radar readings and calculations made, and the pilots' subsequent actions in attempting to track and identify the object.

DECEMBER 1956 FAR EAST
ON DECEMBER 6, 1956, TWO USAF JET PILOTS WERE PRACTICING GROUND RADAR 
POSITIONED INTERCEPTS ON EACH OTHER IN THE VICINITY OF A GROUND CONTROL 
INTERCEPT SITE. 
DURING ONE RUN, THE INTERCEPTING PILOT PICKED UP A STRANGE RADAR BLIP FROM
AN UNKNOWN OBJECT IN THE SKY. FROM THE BLIPS SIZE, ONE-EIGHTH OF AN INCH ON HIGH AND THREE-EIGHTHS OF AN INCH WIDE - THE UFO WAS ESTIMATED AT LEAST AS
LARGE AS A B-29 FOUR-ENGINE BOMBER. RADAR SHOWED IT TO BE TWENTY MILES AWAY, 
30 DEGREES TO THE PILOT'S LEFT.
PILOT CALLED THE GCI (GROUND CONTROL INTERCEPT) SITE ......... RECEIVED
PERMISSION TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE SOURCE OF THE RADAR RETURN.
AS HE HEADED TOWARD THE UFO, THE JET'S INSTRUMENTS SHOWED HE WAS CLOSING AT
A SPEED OF SIX TO SEVEN HUNDRED KNOTS (APPROXIMATELY 720 TO 840 MPH). SUDDENLY
A ROUND OBJECT APPEARED EXACTLY WHERE RADAR SHOWED IT. LATER 
CALCULATIONS INDICATED IT WAS AT LEAST 200 FEET IN DIAMETER, PROBABLY NEARER 350.
BY THIS TIME, THE JET'S RADAR HAD LOCKED ONTO THE UFO AND WAS 
AUTOMATICALLY GUIDING THE PLANE TOWARD THE OBJECT. SUDDENLY THE RADAR WAS
JAMMED BY A STRONG INTERFERENCE. USING ANTI-JAM PROCEDURE, THE PILOT 
SWITCHED FREQUENCY. FOR TEN SECONDS THIS ELIMINATED THE MYSTERIOUS
INTERFERENCE PULSES, THEN THEY BEGAN AGAIN. BUT THE PULSATIONS WERE NOT 
STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK THE RADAR LOCK-ON. THE JET HELD TO ITS COURSE.
THE JET CLOSED TO WITHIN FIVE NAUTICAL MILES OF THE OBJECT AND COULD NOT 
CLOSE FURTHER. WHEN THE PILOT WAS CLOSEST TO THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT, IT
APPEARED TO MAKE A SHALLOW LEFT TURN. IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING CIRCULAR.
AFTER THIS, THE UFO SPEEDED UP SO SWIFTLY THAT THE JET'S RADAR COULD NOT
GET AN ACCURATE READING.
THE OBJECT WAS MOVING UP AND AWAY FROM 1,500 TO 1,800 KNOTS. (1,800 TO 2,160 MPH).
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PILOT REPORTED THE UFO AND LANDED, HIS JET WAS TESTED
BY ANOTHER AIR FORCE PILOT. ALL EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING RADAR, OPERATED 
CORRECTLY. THE AIRCRAFT WAS THEN CHECKED BY GROUND PERSONNEL. AGAIN, ALL
ITEMS WERE SATISFACTORY.
