K. INVESTIGATING OFFICER: OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, SOUTH BOMESARDMENT WING (M) (302), LT HARRY A KINSEY JR., BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE INFORMATION COLLECTED IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE UFO WAS PROBABLY A STAR OR THE PLANET VENUS. THE OBSERVERS WHO SIGHTED THE LIGHT SOURCE ARE ALL IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A STAR. EXPIRENCED WEATHER MEN WHO WERE OBSERVERS ARE SURE THAT IT WAS A STAR WHICH THEY SIGHTED BEFORE ONLY MAGNIFIED BY AN ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION. THE PILOTS WHO OBSERVED THE OBJECT FROM 40,000 FEET CONCURRED THAT THEY BELIEVED IT TO BE A STAR. COMPUTATIONS SHOW THAT VENUS WAS ON A BEARING OF 192 DEGREES AT AN ANGLE OF 23 DEGREES AND 20 MINUTES AT 08/1040Z WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME LOCATION AS THAT FOUND IN PARAGRAPH B2 ON WHICH THE OBSERVERS AGREE. THE BASE ISO DID NOT RECEIVE ANY CALLS ON THIS SIGHTING.
