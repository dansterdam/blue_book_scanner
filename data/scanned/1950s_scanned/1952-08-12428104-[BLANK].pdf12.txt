IN THE "OLD BLUE YONDER -- WHAT?

No recognition manual prints the picture of a blinking, whirling disc, yet reports of the sightings of these objects come in with increasing regularity.

Many times in recent months, the question has been asked: "Why has the USAF renewed its interest in unidentified aerial objects?" The project was dropped as a special priority project in 1949, but it has continued since then as a normal intelligence function. USAF intelligence has nothing to sell except facts, and to pin down the facts in this matter is like running down kilroy.

It is quite understandable why a great many people take a dim view of the study of "flying saucers". The whole subject is so fantastic that anyone studying the pattern of the reports received by the USAF soon finds himself in an atmosphere of "Alice in Wonderland" fantasy. And yet, facts do exist - reports are coming in with increasing frequency, and the persons who see these objects are sincere and in most cases mature and competent people. The sighters are, generally speaking, convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt that what they have seen is real. However, they are sometimes sensitive about discussing the matter, for fear of being thought to be off their rocker. This regrettable attitude on the part of the public has been engendered largely by the fanciful, and occasionally sarcastic, coverage afforded the subject by the press.
