UFO REPORT
In light of the above, our conclusions strongly suggest that the object observed was a balloon.
References paragraph 3 of your basic correspondence. From the information regarding subject observa- tion, it appears that he not only has a dizzy-active imagination, and apparently continues making a nuisance of himself to the 551st and other units concerning UFO sightings that get him nowhere.
That he should report all UFO sightings to the nearest Air Force unit, preferably a 4602nd unit, and not the 551st.
The 551st Air Force in Kennewick sighting; the information is being used as part of the list in connection with other current and analysis of similar sightings and identification of these unidentified aerial objects; and that his interest in the matter is not highly recommended.
Further, he should be informed in a rather firm manner that as an officer of the law he is personally aware of the legal consequences of this incident if it is reported immediately - it is of limited value for investigation.
A standard USAF UFO questionnaire together with form AFOIN-4D should be sent to you in accordance with a request that although late for proper processing, the data would be desirable for consideration of the case. A personal interview by some member of your field unit would be desirable in that it will contribute appropriately to a study and make observation of the type of persqn reporting incidents.
