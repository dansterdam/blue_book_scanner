With reference to the location, there is definitely an inner core and several other objects that were not seen on my first pass, which was too narrow. As a result, I would say there were approximately 15 to 20 objects, and probably two or three times that may have been present. They were extremely bright and metallic in appearance, much brighter than 500 watts. They seemed to stop suddenly and then make a series of sharp angular turns, much more sharply than any manmade object. They hovered rather than flew in a straight line, and their motions were erratic compared to any airplane or conventional aircraft. In some cases, they appeared to be elongated or circular in shape, and in others they seemed to change shape in a manner which suggests they were not solid, physical objects. The color was a brilliant luminescent white, so bright at one point that it was almost painful to look at. This phenomenon was observed for about 10 to 15 minutes. I have been in the Air Force for some time and have never seen anything remotely similar to this before.
