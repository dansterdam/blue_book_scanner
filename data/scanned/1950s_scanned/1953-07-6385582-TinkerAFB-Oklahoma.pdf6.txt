The text found in the document is as follows:

The object was round, very shiny like chrome. I would estimate it to be from 25,000 to 30,000 feet high. It seemed to be stationary and no trail. It would blot out the sky as it passed through the haze. I didn't see the object until it disappeared looking at it through glasses. Considering this would be doing other objects. Every one of a while either side to the horizon would disappear.

I watched this object approximately 21 minutes.

I watched it through field glasses and with the naked eye. The field glasses glass shown the object more clearly.

I was at Tinker Air Force Base Control tower when I saw this object. The object seemed directly overhead at an estimated altitude of 30,000 to 35,000 feet high.

I have been working in the control tower for one year.

The day was clear and a few clouds. The object was very clearly except for some clouds way off on the horizon in the haze and a few wisps.

I didn't take any photographs and didn't see any fragments.

There was one aircraft about 2,000 feet. This aircraft was nowhere near the object.

Considering the way the object disappeared, I don't think it was a weather balloon.
