11. Position Title and comments of the preparing officer, including his preliminary analysis: Intelligence Div, D/O, Hq AC&SC.
Anniston AFB is of note that this is the second UFO report out of there is approximately within a month (re our IR-1-59). The power of suggestion
The possibility of a wx freak was suggested to the AWS, but the weather was stated to have been normal.
The manner of movements of the object suggest that the object may not have been a meteor or some other normal celestial object, but something displaying some unusual cloud effect and giving both the effect of vertical and circular movements.
It is important to note that the 'grapefruit size' description of the object may not have been arrived at during the initial viewing, and is probably an estimate of the original size of the AFT 2-50C, and this estimate is a conclusion subsequent to receipt of this info, not having been forwarded.
Adequate info is also lacking as to the angle of elevation during the appearance and disappearance of the object, and the manner in which it disappeared.
12. Existence of Physical Evidence: None
