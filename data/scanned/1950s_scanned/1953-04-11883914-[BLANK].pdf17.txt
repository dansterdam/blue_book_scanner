Dear Mr. Goll:

This letter report describes progress for the period from December 11, 1952, to January 10, 1953.

Sighting reports have now been processed up to and including August 10, 1952. Evaluation of sighting reports has been completed for sightings up to and including July 15, 1952. Reports for 1917 and 1918 were evaluated; these reports had been at Harvard University, and thus had not been evaluated in chronological order. In our previous letter, it was mentioned that preliminary analysis of data from all sighting reports made before 1952 would begin as soon as possible after 1951 and 1952 reports were processed and evaluated.

It had been hoped that results of the preliminary analysis would be available by January 10, 1953. This has not been possible because of the extensive processing of these reports required more time than anticipated, because of the large number of reports processed and because of the delay after their return from Harvard University. Processing of these reports required more time than anticipated, processing of our forms had been lost. This has delayed our consideration of the 1952 sighting reports.

One two-day evaluation conference was held during this report period, on December 17 and 18, 1952, as mentioned in the last progress report. Evaluation of later processing has been more difficult than for earlier ones.

Preliminary analysis by IBM machines of data from sighting reports dated between 1952 and all begin January 20, 1953, results of this analysis will be reported informally first to Captain Ruppelt, as he has requested. Later, they will be included in a routine progress report.

Coding and evaluation of 1952 sighting reports is continuing, with evaluation conferences scheduled as they are necessary. All sighting reports dated prior to August 25, 1952, should be processed by February 15, 1953. (The period of August 10 to 25, 1952; one during which a large number of sighting reports was received.) By this same date, all reports dated before August 10, 1952, are expected to be evaluated.

Very truly yours,
William T. Reid
