On the morning of the 7th County Attorney Kenneth Gotobed "filed a mental-illness 
complflint against Schmidt after an "extensive examination" by two psychiatrists the 
preceding evening. Gotobed said that Schmidt "continues to use almost the exact 
words each time he tells his story" and that according to the doctors he "greatly 
desires recognition and publicity" (Hub and AP). If found sane, however, he would 
be "free to go his own way"; government officials "discouraged filing charges in 
such cases, for fear that other persons might refuse to report significant events"(UP).

A hearing by the county board of mental-health was held the same evening, 7:30-
9:45 p.m. The examining psychiatrists advised that Schmidt was "very ill" (AP) end 
"in immediate need of psychiatric treatment" (UP), and he was committed to the Hast-
ings State Hospital "for an indefinite period." 

The UP story also reported that "authorities said they had received information: 
from his family that Schmidt was suffering from seeming 'instabilities,' and demands 
on him from unidentified persons and 'crackpots.'" This last phrase suggests para- 
noid delusions. However, we find from the Hub that it was not Schmidt himself, but 
the Kearney police, who had complained of "an increasing demand on the part of_un-
identified persons and obvious crackpots to place a greater strain upon Mr. Schmidt"
(unfbrfhndtely this refers to requests for interviews by saucer aficionados). The Hub 
adds that the concern for the well-being of Mr. Sch.idt was increased Thursd by 
statements by observation, thut hi... ounsIdcr..  ... aad considler...-  ut it an s in ms delusion

on the preceding evening. 


What happened to Schmidt was publicized by nearly every paper in the country, 
and the Air Force was obviously happy to give the incident prominence as "one of the 
only five worthy to be investigated." Regardless of what the true facts are in the 
S8hm1dt case, it is an example that will certainly tend to discourage future wit-
nesses of saucer landings from reporting their experiences. 


We must assume that the psychiatrists were justified in their verdict; it seems 
impossible to take seriously the idea that they would be party to any "railroading" 
conspiracy, or that they were unable to distinguish nervous strain from insanity. 
But the extraordinary speed of the commitment, the participation of the Air Force, 
and the fact that no conclusive proof of Schmidt's insanity was ever made public, 
are bound to arouse a great deal of suspicion in the saucer world. We are glad to 
say that Jules St. Germain (CSI's legal adviser) intends to look into the legal as-
pects of the case. We hope that his findings and comment can appear in the next News 
Letter.
