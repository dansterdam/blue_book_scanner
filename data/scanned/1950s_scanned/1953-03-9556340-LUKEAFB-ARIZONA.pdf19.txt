(s) Analysis of 14 December 1953 incident at Luke AFB, Arizona
DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
DUD DIR 5200.10

The 3 witnesses as a group sighting about 11:35 a.m. on 14 December 1953 a metallic sphere in the sky near Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. The object was seen from a point approximately 5 miles northeast of the base, moving in a southerly direction and estimated to be about 2,000 feet in altitude. The object was observed for approximately 10-15 minutes, during which time it appeared to change directions several times. The object was described as being approximately 40-50 feet in diameter and the witnesses reported that it appeared to have a metallic finish and was rotating in a counterclockwise motion.

Near the end of the sighting, both the length and thickness of the broad trail or tail decreased, suggesting that the photo may be a plane or some other object. However, the object appeared to have come from behind a mountain and is not connected with any known aircraft in the area. The pilot's report indicates some acceleration.
