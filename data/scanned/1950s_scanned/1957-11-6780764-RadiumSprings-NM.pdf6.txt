There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this document. The document appears to be text-based, containing a detailed report regarding a UFO sighting near Radium Springs, New Mexico.

OFFICERS WERE ON DUTY, SGT ALBRO, AIRMAN BARNES AND COLLARD, WERE DISPATCHED FROM THIS SQUADRON TO GET THE COMPLETE STORY. OFFICERS AND WERE INTERVIEWED SEPARATELY AND THEIR STORIES COINCIDED AS TO TIME, DESCRIPTION, AND MOVEMENT. 
AT THIS TIME A CALL WAS RECEIVED AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS THAT CAPT. ____ AND OFFICER ____ HAD OBSERVED AN OBJECT IN THE SKY OVER RADIUM SPRINGS. THIS WAS FOUND TO BE A STAR RISING FROM BEHIND THE ORGAN MOUNTAINS. THE AIRMEN PROCEEDED TO WHERE THEY WERE LOCATED (10 MILES NORTH OF LAS CRUCES. THEY HAD SEEN TWO LIGHTS RISE FROM THE TOP OF THE ORGAN MOUNTAINS. OFFICER TARAGONA NOTICED THE LIGHT FIRST AS HE THOUGHT IT WAS A FIRE ON TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN. WHILE TALKING TO THE POLICEMEN ANOTHER LIGHT APPEARED ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN, RISING SLOWLY, PERHAPS 1,000 FT. PER MINUTE. THE LIGHT ROSE UNTIL IT WAS LOST IN THE CLOUD BANK. 
IT IS THE OPINION OF THIS OFFICER, T/SGT ALBRO, AND OTHER U.S. AIR FORCE PERSONNEL INVOLVED THAT THE OBJECT OBSERVED WAS MERELY A STAR RISING FROM BEHIND THE MOUNTAINS. THE TWO PREVIOUS OBJECTS WERE SIGHTED AT THE SAME POINT AND IT IS OUR CONCLUSION THAT THESE WERE ALSO STARS.
