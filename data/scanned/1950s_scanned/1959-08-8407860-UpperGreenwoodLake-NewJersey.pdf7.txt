OFFICER: 116, NEW YORK ADS., MCGUIRE AFB, NJ. A CHECK OF AIC FORCE BASES IN THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING INDICATED THAT NO WEATHER BALLOONS HAD BEEN RELEASED IN THE AREA AND TIME UNDER QUESTION. HOWEVER, SINCE THE WINDS WERE FROM 220 TO 319 DEGREES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A BALLOON FROM SOME OTHER BASE TO THE WEST OF THE SITE LOCATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE.
