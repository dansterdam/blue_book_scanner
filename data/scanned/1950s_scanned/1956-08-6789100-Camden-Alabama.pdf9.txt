Case 184, Durango, Colo. Aug. 8, 1956—A Durango weatherman, Malcolm Dayton, who watched a mysterious object for nearly an hour through powerful binoculars, described it as a bluish-red, football-like craft which finally left the scene at phenomenal speed. "Whatever it was," said Dayton to the Rocky Mountain News, "it was nothing of any natural phenomenon." Dayton said the object—shaped like a football with one side pushed in"—gave off a constant blue-red radiation and was occasionally obscured by a steamlike haze. After changing position several times the device moved away swiftly, going completely out of range in four or five seconds. Said the weatherman, "from its movements it seemed to be controlled."
