The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it, and place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

The second sketch contains two smaller drawings. The larger one depicts a person standing on a road with hills or mountains in the background. The smaller one shows a curved horizon line with a shape rising above it.
