S/SGT HUGHES SIGHTING WAS CONFIRMED BY -/3C BILLIE E. SPARKS, 
THE TOWER OPERATORS AT DOBSINS AFB. MARIETTA GA. I CONSIDER THE
SIGHTING VALID. WE HAD NO RADAR CONTACTS IN THE AREA. FROM THE
DESCRIPTION GIVEN BY S/SGT HUGHES AND AIRMAN SPARKS MY PRELIMINARY 
ANALYSIS IS THAT THE SIGHTING WAS CAUSED BY A METEROLOGICAL
DISTURBANCE.
