II. RELIABILITY: Source was on a three-day pass from his duty station in Kalispell, Montana, when the object was observed. He was interviewed by the Project Blue Book team. The investigation concluded that the source's report was credible and consistent with other eyewitness accounts. No evidence was found to indicate that the source's observations were not reliable.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
The object was observed at approximately 2:30 AM on 13 July 1956. It was first sighted to the northwest, moving in a southerly direction at an estimated speed of 900 mph. The object was metallic in appearance, elliptical in shape, and approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes before it accelerated and disappeared from view. The object was silent and did not display any visible means of propulsion. The night was clear, and the object was easily visible against the dark sky. The witness stated that it was comparable in size to a basketball-sized object held at arm's length.
