On 6 February, at 0500, C. E. S., a CAA control tower operator at the Chehalis, Washington, airport, observed a luminous oval-shaped object northwest of the airport. The object was first noticed at an estimated elevation of 3,000-4,000 feet, with a hazy aura around it. It was estimated to be about 50-100 feet in diameter and was observed for about 30 minutes and noted that it was clear, distinct, and looked larger than a star. The object apparently did not leave any exhaust trail. The witness reported it did not blink, pulse, or change color. The object disappeared from view going in a northerly direction.  I have no idea what it was, but believe this report may be of interest.
