The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch depicts a curved line with instructions to mark points "A" and "B" on the line to show how high the observed object was above the horizon. The second sketch shows two larger sketches, one depicting a person standing on a road with a curved horizon, and the other showing a person standing on a road with mountains in the background.

Now, acting as an OCR system, I will extract all the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you lost saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
