SIGHTING OF
CREOLA, ALABAMA

On 1 August 1953 at 20:30 PM local time, I was just getting into my automobile when I noticed something in the sky. I called out to my wife, "Lo, there is the space side of "way up heading in a zig zag direction." I could not make out any shape to it and the only thing I noticed was the color of the light. It appeared to be glowing a reddish color in the center and had a reddish glow surrounding it. It was traveling very rapidly and the direction appeared to be straight and level.

It was traveling higher than any aircraft I have ever seen and the whole duration of the sighting was approximately 5 to 10 seconds. There was no sound associated with the sighting. It seemed fairly large in size. There was no aircraft anywhere in the area at the time of the sighting. It appeared to be going in a straight and level flight.
