The image appears to contain a diagram or illustration rather than a photograph. The diagram depicts the path of a descending light, which is described as "dim and the object appeared flat or as a straight line." The object then "appeared bound and very bright blue green when climbing." The diagram also includes some arrows and labels such as "UNCLASSIFIED."

Here is the text from the document, which appears to be a description of the observed phenomenon:
