Since the first sighting was established to be the C-12k there appears to be no relation between this and the second radar sighting.

Mr. _____ after interrogating the GCA operator, was of the opinion that the reported returns indicated aircraft with the exception of the sudden reversal of course (for about 2 miles or 3.3 seconds) and the investigation was continued on that basis. The Duncanville radar station was alerted, after the target of interest reportedly temporarily reversed its course, and their recorded tracks of this target(s) were those of normal aircraft traveling at about 240 NM. A check was made through flight service for all flight plans; however, no flights of this description could be found. Since flight service has plans on cross-country flights only, a further check was initiated to all surrounding air fields for furlough information on local or round robin flights which might have been in the area at the time of the sightings.

Through this checking of surrounding bases, it was found that the 367TRS WACO SQ, James Connley AFB, which is a radar observers training school was carrying out corrections on the night of the fourth in the vicinity and covering the same time period. These operations consisted of flights of two B-25's running missions on each other. While their exact locations at any given time could not be determined, the maneuvers described by the radar operator were very similar and lead to the belief that these were the same objects as reported.
