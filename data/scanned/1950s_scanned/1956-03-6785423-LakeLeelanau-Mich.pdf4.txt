III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On March 23, 1956, at about 10:30 P.M., the source was on his way home from a basketball game. As he was driving along the road near Lake Leelanau, he observed an object in the sky which appeared to be quite large and bright. The object seemed to be hovering and then suddenly started to descend rapidly. The source stated that the object was about the size of a house and that it was brighter than a star. The object was observed for about 20-30 seconds and then seemed to fade away. The source stated that he was quite excited and scared at the time and that he had the urge to jump up and down rapidly before it just seemed to fade away.
