The text from the document is as follows:

CLASSIFICATION:	SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
ORIGINATING AGENCY: USAF C PROJECTS AFS
REPORT NO FTOR 1-58 (and) PE FTOR 2-58 PAGES: 2
I. SOURCE: 
Address: Northport (COMDR W.C. STROUT Jr.), Maine 
Age: 59
Education: Junior College
Qualifications: None

II. RELIABILITY: Source gave the appearance of an elderly and reliable witness, willing to
answer all questions but was subject to self-delusion. Investigators were unable to
obtain corroborating Source relative. 

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source volunteered the following:
"Also, in the back field, about 2:30 p.m. of July 10th, about 200 yd from the house, a hovering object around 12 or 15 feet off the ground, until Mr. Strout drove his tractor out, then it slowly rose up and maintained a hovering position at a higher altitude. It appeared to be about 25 feet in diameter and a pale blue-green color, and was all one piece with no windows or openings of any kind. It was hovering in the air about 5 minutes,
then suddenly took off at a rapid pace, climbing up and looked the place over, but found no objects there seemed to be any unusual activity of intelligence controlled."

During the interview Source constantly referred to an artist's conception of the July 1956 issue of "COSMOPOLITAN" magazine, and insisted that images on some photographs submitted with the report looked identical to the one shown on the cover of that magazine. Source had kept a scrapbook containing a file of the alleged space men.

Source had kept a kind of "rough log" concerning the sightings and made a considerable show of frequently referring to entries therein.

Includi: Two (2) pieces of charred paper.
