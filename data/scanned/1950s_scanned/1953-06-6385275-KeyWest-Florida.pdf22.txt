The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a document titled "FLYOBRT, Larne" regarding an incident at the U.S. Naval Base in Key West, Florida on June 20, 1953.

The text of the document is as follows:

U.S. NAVAL BASE
KEY WEST, FLORIDA

From: Commander, U.S. Naval Base, Key West, Florida
To: Headquarters, 456th Troop Carrier Wing (H)
Ref: (a) Hq. 456th Troop Carrier Wing (H) RID ltr to CO NAVBASE
Key West, Fla. of 20 JUL 1953

1. The information stated in the third paragraph of reference (a) has been checked with the Commanding Officer at the Naval Air Station and it has been determined that there were no aircraft in the air during the time indicated. The pilot departure from the area was at 2330 on 19 JUN 1953, this being the only flight activity at that time.

2. We were unable to determine that any aircraft with searchlights were in the air in the Key West area at any time close to the time of the reported sighting.

3. The information you have on the two local flights was apparently obtained from a misdocumented flight schedule of Air Develoment Squad-ron ONE. These two flights were cancelled prior to the scheduled time of departure.
