The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, specifically a "SECOND STATUS REPORT ON PROJECT STARK PPS-100" from June 6, 1952. The text in the document describes the progress on Project Stark, including the original requirements such as providing a panel of consultants, assisting in improving interrogation forms, analyzing existing sighting reports, subscribing to a newspaper clipping service, and apprising the Sponsor monthly of all work done on PPS-100. The document also mentions that these original requirements will be supplemented and extended, and that the formal arrangements have not yet been completed. The summary states that the panel of consultants has been selected and indoctrinated in a series of meetings, and they are now engaged in completing the remaining requirements of PPS-100.
