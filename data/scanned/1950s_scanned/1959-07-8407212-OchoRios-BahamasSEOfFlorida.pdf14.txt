Dear Sir,

I cannot readily explain by sensor refutting or controlled dim activities, which you will be interested in this report. At 01.27 on the evening of July 9th, my attention was drawn to the North Coast of Jamaica. I was amazed when I saw a strange craft, the nature of which I have considerable difficulty to describe. It was high flying object, bright in all quadrants as far as the eye could reach, and could not be located altitude precisely east of the North Star on a course slightly east of South at an elevation of approximately 5000 ft. At 1 wished the object is found to be a glider or shape of aurora when the bright light at the northern end implying that it appears indistinguishable through a light hazing phenomenon, no motion or trail attached and is in an accustomed manner and listened for the motors. Witness is mindful to be interrogated as to be the impression obtained, however as soon as recovered to obtain as accurate an impression as possible.
...maintained until 02.12 at which time inspection changes so to North East in which direction the object became too dim to discern by 01.15 % Daylight observation the object changed position approximately 45 degrees of horizontal angle while maintaining at almost the same elevation until 01.27 eventually was lohist in the south western horizon and disappeared in the above manner.
