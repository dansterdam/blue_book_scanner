SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

1. This is a report on the object sighted from the Control
Tower, Kirtland AFB, approximately 2300 hours local, by

2. The object appeared to be approaching the tower from the west
when I first noticed it. This situation existed for approximately ten
(10) minutes. The nearest to a description I could give is as follows:
It looked something like a falling star except that it was suspended.
The color appeared to change from the time seen red to bright white.
There was no set rule as to the time. At times the object seemed to
be stationary and other times it moved up and then to the west slowly.
I observed the object while under the weather observer's observation
scope, which is built into the window. I observed that the object was
turning as it began to recede. I kept it in sight for approximately
twenty (20) minutes up to 2320 hours local. I estimate the height
above ground (AGL) to twenty-five (25) thousand feet. I could not ven-
ture a guess as to the distance. (I am not an observor or qualified
in any way to judge distance or height.)
