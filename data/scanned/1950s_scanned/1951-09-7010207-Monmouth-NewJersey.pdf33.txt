AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
DATE OF INFORMATION: 23 SEPTEMBER 1951
PLACE: MONMOUTH, NEW JERSEY
EVALUATION: D-6
SOURCE: FAYE

"The results of the investigation of sighting reports from Monmouth reveal the following: At approximately 5:30 PM, 23 September 1951, the pilot of a Pennsylvania Central Airlines plane reported seeing a large unidentified object while flying at an altitude of 4,000 feet over Asbury Park, New Jersey. The object was described as being metallic in appearance, cigar-shaped, and approximately 30 feet long. The pilot reported that the object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, far in excess of the speed of the aircraft, and that it exhibited a pulsating motion. Although the pilot attempted to obtain a closer look at the object, it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from sight.

The fact remains that one experienced and observant witness was present and saw an object traveling more than 700 mph on 23 September in the New Jersey area."
