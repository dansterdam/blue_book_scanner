Director of the U.S. "Moonwatch" teams was contacted for a check of his report. It indicates that although a number of moonwatch units were making observations on projectiles at that time, none observed any object in the area in question.

No reports from any U.S. astronomical observatory of any unusual occurrence or object in the area in question.

ATRE Conclusions: Probably a jet aircraft of the F-86 series at high altitude. The air force suddenly discontinued their air patrols in that area for reasons not divulged. A member of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory concurs that the object was probably an aircraft.
