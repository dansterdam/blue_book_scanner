The text describes the observer's experience of seeing a light that seemed to be traveling at a medium fast speed and disappearing behind trees, reappearing, and then disappearing again. The text also mentions the appearance of a searchlight at several different times and that the light seemed to be a steady bluish-white light with a star-like brilliance.

At 9:12 o'clock, EST, on 25 May 56, I was walking in the driveway of my home when I noticed too bright to be traveling at a medium fast speed and no noise was discernable. The light disappeared behind trees and reappeared on my right. I watched as it backed up and disappeared. The light seemed to reappear two or three times more to the right 5 or 3 times, It disappeared on right and reappeared on left and disappeared again. The appearance of a searchlight was noted at several different times. The rest of the time the light seemed to be a steady bluish-white light with a star-like brilliance. 
If my estimation of altitude of 5,000 feet is correct, then the light was traveling at approximately 75 MPH.
