W2                                                          BY JOSEPH L. MYLER
                                                               U^N^ED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
WASHINGTON, JAN. 27 --(UPI)-- PEOPLE ARE SEEING FEWER FLYING SAUCERS, 
AND A PSYCHIATRIST HERE THINKS MAYBE SAUCERS ARE GOING OUT OF FASHION. 
"I COME INTO STYLE," DR. ADDISON M. DUVAL IS SURE "SOMETHING ELSE 
WILL COME INTO STYLE."

DUVAL, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF WASHINGTON'S FAMOUS ST. ELIZABETHS HOS-
PITAL, TOLD UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL THAT SEEING THINGS WHICH 
DON'T EXIST IS A COMMON RESULT OF ANXIETY GENERATED BY FEAR OF THE 
UNKNOWN.

AND THE TIMES AREN'T GETTING ANY LESS ANXIOUS OR THE FUTURE ANY LESS 
UNCERTAIN.

OF COURSE, NOT EVERYBODY WHO SEES WHAT THE AIR FORCE CALLS AN 
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT (UFC) IS MENTALLY SICK. BUT SOME SIGHTERS, 
DUVAL BELIEVES, ARE SUFFERING FROM DELUSIONS OR HALLUCINATIONS.

THE AIR FORCE REPORTED LAST WEEK THAT UFO REPORTS FELL OFF 14 PER 
CENT IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1958 TO A TOTAL OF 258. MOST OF THESE WERE 
SUBSEQUENTLY IDENTIFIED AS SATELLITES, PLANES, BALLOONS, SHOOTING 
STARS, PLANETS AND EVEN EARTH SHININGS."

THE AIR FORCE SAID THAT A TOTAL OF THE 259 UFOs WERE ARTIFICIAL MOONS 
SIGHTED AS THEY WINKED THEIR WAY ACROSS THE SKY. IT LISTED FEWER THAN 
ONE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL AS "UNKNOWN"--MEANING THAT THE AIR FORCE 
COULDN'T FIND OUT WHAT THE THING REPORTED ACTUALLY WAS.

AS FOR NON-RATIONAL UFO SIGHTINGS, DUVAL SAID "WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO PREDICT THE FLYING SAUCER CRAZE, WHENEVER SOMETHING CAPTURES 
THE INTEREST OF PEOPLE GENERALLY, HE SAID, "IT USUALLY SHOWS UP IN 
DELUSIONS OF THE MENTALLY ILL.

DUVAL RECALLS A PERIOD WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE PART OF 
THE FAMOUS 'FLY ANDY' RADIO TEAM.

"IF THE FLYING SAUCER DELUSION IS ON THE DECLINE, ONE REASON MAY BE 
THAT SAUCERS ARE GETTING TOO MUCH COMPETITION FROM REAL THINGS--
SATELLITES, LUNAR PROBES, 'SUN ROCKETS,'" DUVAL SAID. "AFTER A WHILE ANY 
WIDELY SHARED DELUSION TENDS, HE SAID," TO GET OUT OF STYLE."

HE THINKS THE NEXT DELUSION MAY BE AN ELABORATION OF THE SPACE-
TRAVEL MOTIF. BUT JUST WHAT FORM IT WILL TAKE HE COULDN'T GUESS.
