The image provided does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text and a simple diagram. The diagram appears to be a schematic or illustration of some kind, but I cannot identify or name any of the elements depicted.

Transcribing the text in the image:

On the page there appears to be handwritten text describing some sort of observation or investigation. The text mentions "apparent motion" and "velocity" as well as some observations about the "angular diameter" and "luminous intensity" of the observed object. The text also refers to a "diagram" that is included on the page.

Below the main block of text, there are three bullet points or paragraphs labeled a, b, and c. These paragraphs discuss further details about the observation, including mentions of "angular size", "vertical angle", and "lateral motion".

Overall, the content of the text appears to be a technical description or report of some kind of observed aerial phenomenon, likely related to the Project Blue Book investigation referenced in the provided context.
