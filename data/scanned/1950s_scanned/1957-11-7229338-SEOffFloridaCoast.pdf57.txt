The moon will be just past last quarter, rising around midnight, so its light may interfere a little with the meter display, although not as much as if there were a full moon.
Around 2:00 a.m., perhaps, a dozen of these meteors may be seen an hour, appar ently radiating from a point in the eastern sky in the constellation of Leo, the Lion. Because of this, the shower is known as the Leonids.
Actually the meteors are moving in a great circular swarm around the sun, which 
the earth crosses at this time of year, so their motion is parallel. The effect of seem ing to radiate from Leo is one of perspec tive. Their tracks converge in the distance, like the parallel tracks of a railroad.
Meteors Come in Cycles
These meteors take about 33 years to en circle the sun, and at one point they are much more numerous than elsewhere. In 1833 and 1866 the earth encountered this concentration and there was a brilliant dis play, with meteors seemingly coming down almost like snowflakes.
By the next two times around, in 1899 and 1932, the dense cluster had been switched aside because of the gravitational attraction of Jupiter as it had passed near it. In these years, instead of a good display, the Leonid meteors were quite poor.
Despite the bombardment of the earth by these, and other meteor showers, the meteors do not reach the ground. They are tiny things, no larger than pinheads, and are completely burned by friction as they en counter the resistance imposed by the earth's atmosphere.
There also are stray meteors, not con nected with any regular showers. Once in a while these are large enough to survive the passage through the atmosphere. One of the largest meteorites discovered is that found, along with two smaller ones, in Greenland in 1894. It measures 11 by 7 by 5 feet and weighs 36.5 tons.
