U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)

In order that your information may be filed and coded as accurately as possible, please use the following space to write out a short description of the event that you observed. You may repeat information that you have already given in the questionnaire, or indicate differences that you believe are important. Try to present the details of the observation in the order in which they occurred. Additional pages of the same size paper may be attached if they needed.

The handwritten text on the form describes the observed event in a cursive script, but I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals mentioned. The text includes observations about an unidentified object in the sky, described as having "white lights" and additional details about the observed event.
