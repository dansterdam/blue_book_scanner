MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS
OF AUSTRALIA
by -------

"Ever since white man has never heard of phenomenon familiar to nearly all australians. a visible phenomenon occasionally seen about night with a bright oscillation light shoots up from the horizon, travels rapidly over the skies for some distance and disappears rather mysteriously. the strange oblong reports that it is watching him.

as the closer one approaches the further it recedes.   a man who has spent nearly 16 yeas in western australia states that mention has been made in station letters of this eerie impression that it is watching him - at a distance. apparently there is no legend associated with the "wim-wim light", as the aborigines call it, the words "wim-wim" signify seeing has no meaning. riding his horse, said the eerie luminosity and chase it. in his excitement he ran his horse into a fence, was thrown violently to the ground and dazed for some time.

an otherwise reliable source, a dentist who lives in goulburn, new south wales, writes that he saw from his car two bright lights in the sky about the size of a soup plate, hovering over a paddock and dancing about. then he got out of his car, walked through a paddock and under the lights, and succeeded in getting near enough to see that the light was suspended about eight or ten feet above the ground. suddenly it soared to one side and was gone."
