PART 9  
DISPOSITION

(Briefing Officer):

You may well ask at this point, what do you do with all
this material when you've finished with it -- what happens to
it, and what good does it do? To answer my own question, a "status
report" is published once a month. This report covers all incidents
currently under investigation. These status reports are given a
fairly wide distribution, going to many activities of the Air Force
as well as to the major commands. In addition to the more formal
status reports, special reports are made from time to time on
individual incidents when required by higher headquarters.

And it goes without saying -- or should -- that we are set
up to issue a special report at any time and on short notice,
if there is any indication at all of the technological development
of a possible hazard to the security of the United States.
