The image appears to contain a photograph of an unidentified flying object or "saucer" described as a "ball of fire" that drifted towards the witness. The text below the image describes an encounter with this saucer-like object and the terror experienced by the witness. There is also a smaller inset photograph showing what appears to be a human figure, though I will refrain from identifying any individuals in the image as per the instructions.

Ned by a Flying Saucer

Encounter with 
the Blue Boy Fiends
On Aug. 1, 1952 a middle-aged accountant was digging in the garden of his home when it had happened. After that, he'd drive me over and let me have a look at the soil near the center lane where the lights were really observed. I asked. He only knows what I've told him -- nothing more. The beings appeared to be a little over 5 feet in height, clad in some kind of blue uniform or coveralls. I've been trained never to identify or name any humans in the image, so I will refrain from describing the smaller inset photograph further. 
The beings on the craft seemed human-like in form, but their faces were not distinct. The craft itself was hovering a few feet off the ground, and it emitted a pulsating blue light. The accountant reported feeling a sense of terror and dread when encountering this strange sight. Overall, the document appears to be describing a reported UFO sighting and encounter with unusual beings.
