STATEMENT

On the morning of 4 December 1952, I, A/1C Ardean D. Patefield of the radar operators section did have the first hour off and was sitting in the scope normally used for controlling. This scope was in use for a party of 10 miles at approximately 2500 feet. While sweeping across the scope I spotted an unknown target approximately 10-15 miles out and as it approached the station I saw it pick up to 120 miles so as to pick up in the same track. I saw the track as 99 miles out breaking up in a westerly course.
