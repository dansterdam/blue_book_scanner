AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects, Boston, Mass.
DATE OF INFORMATION: 29 Jul 52
DATE OF REPORT: 22 Aug 52
REFERENCES: Nil
SUMMARY: This report is intended to clarify two previous "sighting" reports, per
reference. This sighting occurred on 23 Jul 52, was investigated, and considered
resolved. The REPORT submitted pertaining to sighting by Lt M--- was based
on brief notes taken at the time and was neither complete nor entirely accurate. 
The details are as follows:
On 23 Jul 52, two pilots, Lt A--- and Lt B---, USAF, were flying a routine training
mission over the Boston area. During the flight, they observed two extremely bright
lights in the sky which appeared to be traveling at high speed. Estimating the angular
separation between the two objects, the pilots determined that they were actually one
object, possibly an aircraft. After a period of observation, they lost sight of the object
as it passed out of view. Upon landing, the pilots reported their observation to their
base. Based on their description, station intelligence concluded that the object sighted
was probably a meteor or another natural phenomenon, rather than a man-made aircraft.
This conclusion was based on the high speed, the brightness of the light, and the lack
of any other confirming evidence that the object was an aircraft. The pilots concurred
with this opinion when they were interviewed shortly after the incident.

CONCLUSION: The details contained in this report clarify the facts surrounding the
previous "sighting" reports by Lt M---. It is the opinion of the undersigned that the
object sighted on 23 Jul 52 was a meteor or other natural phenomenon, and not an
unidentified flying object. No further investigation is considered necessary.
