This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old report, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document reads:

"U3A-HATS
"Flying Egg" seen by Air France Pilots
Andrews Intelligence Division, T-2, HATS
26 November 1952 - 7 October 1952 Unevaluated
Charles J. Fowler, Capt., USAF Documentary

Report contains information taken from the 3 October 1952 edition of "France Soir" which is not particularly reliable. This information is also reported by General de Castries, Commander of the French Air Force in his hand-monthly Intelligence Report dated 26 October 1952.
