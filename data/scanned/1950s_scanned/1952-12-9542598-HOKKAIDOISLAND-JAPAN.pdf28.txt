The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report titled "Air Intelligence Information Report". The text on the page seems to be a detailed description of an unidentified aerial phenomenon sighting.

I will now act as an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system and produce all the text found in the document:

STATEMENT

I was on duty in the control tower, 5 December 1952, at 1830 hours. Upon receiving a call from 4-11, I turned on the equipment and saw an object to the northwest which changed colors from red, white and green. The object appeared to be at an altitude or 10,000 to 15,000 feet and traveling at a high rate of speed. There were no air craft in the vicinity at the time. The object changed colors rapidly - red, white and green - but did not make any sound. I observed the object for approximately 5 minutes and then it disappeared from view. I could not determine the distance of the object, but it appeared to be quite a distance from the tower.

The ground observer conditions were as follows: 3.000 - 5,000 scattered. The ceiling was 2,000 feet broken and the visibility was from 8 to 10 miles. There was no wind at the time. The temperature was 30'F.

The ground observer who spotted the object first called the tower and reported having seen the object. I immediately turned on the equipment and also observed the object.

IS was after 1900 hours. I observed a white light which appeared to be moving at a high rate of speed at about 10.000 feet altitude. It was moving in a straight level flight path from south to north. The light was observed for about 2 minutes and then disappeared. No sound was heard. No other aircraft were in the vicinity at the time.

The weather conditions were the same as listed above.
