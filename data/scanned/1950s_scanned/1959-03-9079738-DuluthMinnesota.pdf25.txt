The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, with text describing a flight path chart that is not included in the image.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

This is a sketch, attached to this page, the portion of a local area chart which shows the location of the sighting. On this chart plot the flight path of your aircraft and the object, as necessary.

If a local area chart is not available, roughly sketch in the area of the sighting showing direction and location of the object in relation to your aircraft and time marks as necessary.
