Here is the text from the document:

6 October 1959

Dear Mr [redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 30 September concerning an Unidentified Flying Object sighting of 20 November 1952.

The only UFO sighting on that date which was reported to the Air Force was one which has been identified as Salton Sea flare. There is no connection between the Salton Sea sighting and the one reported by Mr. Adamsit's sighting obviously has no connection with Mr. Adamsit's sighting.

We do not have the facilities, funds, or personnel to reproduce records for dissemination to private groups or individuals. In lieu thereof, I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense press release on this subject.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
