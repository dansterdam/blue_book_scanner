WHAT WOULD BE YOUR PROCEDURE IN CASE OF REPORTED UIDs? 
FROM CAPT BO SMITH: PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT NO PHOTOGRAPHS WERE RECEIVED WITH YOUR LETTER. THERE WERE NONE ENCLOSED. 
THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION IN YOUR LETTER CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH REPORTED UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA SHOULD BE HANDLED. IN GENERAL WE FOLLOW A PREDETERMINED PROCEDURE WHENEVER A REPORT OF A UIDs IS RECEIVED.
FIRST, IF POSSIBLE, THE REPORT IS VERIFIED BY PERSONAL INTERVIEW WITH THE OBSERVER. THIS IS DONE TO GET ADDITIONAL DETAILS AND CLARIFY ANY POINTS THAT ARE NOT CLEAR FROM THE WRITTEN REPORT.  
NEXT, EVERY EFFORT IS MADE TO IDENTIFY THE OBJECT OR PHENOMENON REPORTED. ALL KNOWN AIRCRAFT, ASTRONOMICAL PHENOMENA, WEATHER BALLOONS, ETC. ARE CHECKED. RADAR AND PHOTOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS IS DONE IF EVIDENCE IS AVAILABLE.
WHEN ALL ATTEMPTS AT IDENTIFICATION FAIL, THE REPORT IS CLASSIFIED AS UNIDENTIFIED AND INCLUDED IN OUR FILES. THE COMPLETE FILE IS THEN REVIEWED BY TECHNICAL PERSONNEL FOR ANY SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE. 
IT IS HOPED THAT THIS EXPLANATION OF OUR PROCEDURE WILL BE HELPFUL. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.
