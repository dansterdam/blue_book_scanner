The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document or letter discussing a textile sample that was reported to be "angel-hair" - a material associated with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) at the time. The text describes the characteristics of the material and cautions against carrying it or spreading the impression that its origin was other than normal. The document is signed at the bottom.

a. Textile sample: 
The sample purported to be "angel-hair," reportedly a visible by-product of the "fuel used in flying saucers," is given both chemical and microscopic tests and is, without doubt, "a nitrogen-bearing polyamide resin," which is more commonly called "Bomex's Rayons" in the U.S. This material, after exposure to air for 72 hours in the material's frame, did not volatilize. Care is to be used by investigators or others who may be exposed to the atmosphere by certain manufacturers of the textile industry, in this case, anyone.

We are not pressed for an explanation as to what the substance or indications were leading you to believe that this material was so-called "angel-hair." We should like to comment on your statement that it would appear foolish for anyone (your source, in this case) to carry almost two pounds of metal to a gravel pit, supposedly to give the specimen some impression that its origin was other than normal. It may interest you to know that our files contain a large number of cases indicating that the investigators' efforts and seemingly clever means have resulted in attempts to create such impressions.

We are certain that you will agree with us that 'elaborate' attempts at fabrication and hoaxes result in a needless loss of government time, money, and effort. Not to say the taxpayer's money.

Sincerely,
