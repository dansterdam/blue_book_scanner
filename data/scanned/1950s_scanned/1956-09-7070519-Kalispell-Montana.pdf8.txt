II. RELIABILITY OF SOURCE AND INFORMATION SOURCE IMPRESSED US: The investigators are being distinctly above average intelligence and ability. The details of their observations and reports indicate very careful thought and study of the available evidence. They are convinced that this report represents a valid sighting and are presenting their information as accurately as possible, although the know that sightings of such objects should be reported.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
1. Source was in his residence when the GOC Post supervisor telephoned him and informed him that some unusual objects were spotted in the south-southeastern sky and requested his opinion as to its identity.
2. Source immediately went outside and observed a brilliant glow descending towards the horizon, approximately 75 degrees above the horizon. He observed it for about 15 minutes. 
3. The object appeared red, but later appeared to turn to white. This object would disappear at varying intervals, and then reappear. During the disappearance, the object left a trail across the sky, leaving a cloud.
4. Source declined to estimate the size of the object, stating frankly that he could not do so. He stated that it was difficult and that it was impossible to judge the size of such an object in the sky.
