extended the range of present-day aircraft. This applies to
conventional aircraft, however, and since our reports indicating
aircraft point to a highly unconventional type, it is felt that
in-flight refueling as a possible explanation for the phenomena
offers little promise.

(Jet Engine Development)

To complete our consideration of the field of aircraft
development with special emphasis upon the possibilities of
increased range, let us review for a moment the aircraft gas turbine.

It is a truism to refer to jet engine development as sensational,
but I wonder if that tired word "sensational" really expresses
just how remarkable that development has been. In some ten years
we have gone from less than nine hundred pounds thrust to more
than ten thousand. Turbojets with dry static sea level ratings of
about ten thousand pounds thrust are already installed in aircraft
and undergoing flight test. And we have currently in bench testing
engines with thrust ratings of up to eighteen thousand pounds.
