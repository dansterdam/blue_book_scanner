SHILOH, OHIO, JULY, 1957

On July 6, 1957, at approximately 9:55 p.m. EST, several persons observed an unidentified aerial object in the sky over Shiloh, Ohio. The witnesses, all adults, were engaged in a religious service at a church near Shiloh when they observed the object.

The object was described as round or oval in shape, and illuminated. It was observed to be traveling in a straight line in a northwest to southeast direction at what was estimated to be a very high speed. The object was visible for approximately 3 to 4 minutes before disappearing from view.

Investigation of this incident by Air Force personnel failed to disclose any evidence that the object observed was an aircraft, missile, or natural phenomenon. The case therefore remains classified as an "unidentified" under Project Blue Book.
