Dear Major Fournet:

Here are the three Ansco color transparencies, 2t x 2t, shot by Metro-Ceorge photographer on September 23, aboard the USS. Franklin D. Roosevelt while covering the NATO maneuvers for us.

Following is a letter written to me yesterday describing the circumstances surrounding the shooting of these pictures:

"On September twentieth, at a few minutes after four p.m., I was standing on the forward flight deck of the USS Franklin D. Roosevelt, biggest carrier in the world. With me, at the time, was the commander of the Deck. I had sighted this object - a bright, silvery, metallic-appearing object - hovering above the ship at an altitude of about 1000 feet. It seemed to be motionless. I picked up my Speed Graphic, intending to take a picture of this object, which was in plain sight of myself and about a hundred or so others who were standing on the deck. Just as I was about to fire the shutter, this thing shot up and out of sight in the direction of the after end of the ship. I shouted something to the commander of the Deck, and he and I both started to try and locate it again. We were unable to take any pictures of this object.

"The next day there was an item on the telosc tine as follows:
SPECIAL REPORT FOR OCS 2S (CBS FAZ) THAT IN THE NATO MANEUVERS OPERATIONS MAINBRACE TODAY INVESTIGATED & REPORT THAT A FLYING SAUCER PLANE REPORTED YESTERDAY THAT THEY SAW A SILVER CIGAR-SHAPED OBJECT PULLING UP TO INCREDIBLE SPEED AND VANISHED BEFORE THEIR EYES."

This took place in the same part of the world and could be part of the same situation. I have marked out the name of the individual for confidentiality reasons.
