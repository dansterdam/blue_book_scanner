Dear sir:
By the time we have already looked at the picture you can guess it came around 10:15 P.M on July 25, 1952. Friday: Mrs. Sawyer, Mrs. Miller, and myself saw these strange objects in the sky. We first spotted them, they appeared quite large and traveled towards the east. They revealed a greenish fluorescent glow and seemed to be about 10 seconds in duration. After they moved out of sight, we watched for several minutes but didn't see any more of them. We would be glad to give you any other details you may desire.
