(7) The object moved up and down in an instantaneous manner, but made no sound and left no trail.
(2) " . . . they were OVERLY fast and they zipped away at very high speeds, not like anything we know about today . . ."
(2) The object appeared stationary at times, then accelerated at phenomenal speeds, far in excess of any known aircraft. It was observed for several minutes as it executed these maneuvers.
(3) " . . . it seemed to show that the objects had a power or intelligence controlling their flight. . . ."
(3) There was no noise or exhaust trail associated with the objects. This, together with their instantaneous acceleration and other observed characteristics, indicates they were under intelligent control.
