Coasters Startled by Meteorite
PALM SPRINGS, Calif., Feb. 6 (UP) - Coasters in this resort area reported seeing a "comet-like object" in the sky yesterday which turned out to be a bright meteor shooting toward the earth. 
The object, which was observed by hundreds of people, appeared suddenly in the sky about 5 p.m. (PST) and traveled swiftly toward the earth, witnesses said.
It was described as a ball of fire, about the size of a football, with a long tail trailing behind. The object disintegrated before reaching the earth, they added.
The report said "it turned the sky as bright as day" and was "as bright as a flash bulb."
It was reported that the object was seen as far north as Los Angeles and as far south as the Mexican border.
FLASH' ALSO SIGHTED AT ASHBURTON
ASHBURTON, England, Feb. 7 (Reuters) -- A bright flash of light was seen in the skies over this town yesterday, a defense ministry spokesman said today.
The spokesman said the flash, which was seen over a wide area, was probably caused by a meteor. He said numerous reports had been received from eyewitnesses, including some Royal Air Force personnel at a nearby base.
The spokesman said there was no evidence of any aircraft or other solid object in the sky at the time the flash was observed. He said the phenomenon was probably similar to that observed over the United States yesterday.
