MEMORANDUM FOR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION SERVICES, SAFH
SUBJECT: Congressional Public Hearings - Unidentified Flying Objects

Major Donald Keyhoe of the National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena has been indicating the existence of possible Congressional hearings regarding the operations of the Air Force's Unidentified Flying Objects Operations, to hold open hearings on the question of the existence of Unidentified Flying Objects.

2. In this regard investigators for the subcommittees contacted SAFH and a meeting was held on 31 January 1958 at 1000 hours in Mr. Horner's office on the Air Force's position regarding possible hearings. Members of this meeting were:

Mr. William Weitzen, Deputy for Research & Development Operations
Lt. Colonel William R. Kelso, SAFH 
Major Joseph E. Boland, SAFH
Major James F. Byrne, AFCIN
Major Lawrence J. Tacker, SAFIS
Mr. Donald O'Donnell, FBI (Committee Investigator)
Mr. Jack Healey, FBI (Committee Investigator)

3. The committee's investigators simply asked if the Air Force desired such hearings. Mr. Weitzen stated that he did not see the need for it but would cooperate in every way possible if the committee insisted. The discussion indicated that the committee would want's to wait until Mr. Horner returned but thought Mr. Horner would agree with his statement that we would cooperate in every way. The two investigators were invited to visit ATIC at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for background information. They said they would do so if hearings developed.
