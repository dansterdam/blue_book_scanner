The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a description of a sighting by an observer between 8:35 and 8:45 a.m. of a disc-shaped object in the sky that was flat and round like a flat plate, made of duralumin, and gave off reflected light similar to a highly polished airplane wing. 

The text also mentions that the observer was interviewed and would be very glad to fill out an official questionnaire. Additionally, the document discusses an interview with Mr. Redman and Mr. Morris, whose picture appeared in Life magazine in an article on flying saucers. Their stories were found to be remarkably consistent.

The document then provides a summary and discussion, noting that over 40 astronomers were interviewed, a higher percentage than among the general population, and that astronomers may be more likely to be fooled by balloons, aircraft, and similar objects compared to the general public.
