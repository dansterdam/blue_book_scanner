AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

DATE: 17 September 1950
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Objects (Balloons)
UNITS INVOLVED: 509th Bomb Group, 8th Air Force

SUMMARY: (brief summary of report, 6th paragraph and 2nd sentence are most significant)
At approximately 2100 hours on 17 September 1950 while on guard duty, witnesses noticed several unidentified aerial objects in the sky over the base area. Four objects were observed at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. They appeared to the witnesses to be round, silver, and silent. It was estimated that they were approximately 50 feet in diameter and traveled at a speed of 300-400 miles per hour. The objects were first observed traveling in a north to south direction, and then disappeared from sight to the south. The objects could not be identified positively, but it is believed they may have been high altitude weather balloons.

A check with the Base Operations revealed that there were no aircraft in the local area at the time of this observation.

A check with the Base Weather Station revealed that the ceiling was twenty-three thousand (23,000) feet and that visibility was thirteen (13) miles.

The Early Warning Radar Station, this Base, was inoperative at the time of this observation.
