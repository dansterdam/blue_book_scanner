Text found in the document:

On 19 December 1952 at about 0650 hours, I was sitting in front of Ross Dock #3 on the 54th Strategic Reconnaissance Ramp Army Air Field, Andersen AFB, Guam. I was looking at the northern sky, when I noticed an object travelling at a tremendous rate of speed, leaving a trail behind it. At first I thought I might see it. When I looked in the southeasterly direction of the sky, suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw an object come from behind a bank of clouds. It was so bright I called to the other fellow, "Look at the shining star!" As I continued to watch the object, it was circling and climbing rapidly when the bright light went out. After a few seconds it reappeared and the light pulsed in another opening between clouds. It was traveling in such a irregular motion, that I could not see that there were any distinct portions to it, a bright, shiny surface, and it seemed to me to be a trailing star. After the light went out, the object still continued, and I was able to see a silver, silvery blue trail behind the object other than the bright silvery blue flame which seemed to disappear. The object did not flame was long and slender and traveling about twice as fast as any jet plane I've ever seen. When it last saw it, it disappeared behind a cloud bank just north of where I was watching. It seems to have traveled a tremendous distance before disappearing altogether. It didn't show up again.
