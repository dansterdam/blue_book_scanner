AT FIRST THERE WERE
from the Air Force on Captain
Killian's report, Three days
later, on February 28, the Air Force
issued a statement through the
Technical Intelligence Center that
the report made on the 25th had
been "carefully considered" and
the Belt of Orion. Glimpsed through
broken clouds, said the AF report,
"Killian's stars created an illusion of
moving objects, deceiving the
observer."
In support of this judgment, the
AF FORCE declared that one of its
report planes flying from Washing-
ton to Dayton that same night
had been photographed through the
clouds at 8,500 feet and could vouch
for the illusion.
COMMENT: Captain Killian
stated that other observers
at the same time, that the airplane
was above the clouds and had about
100 miles visibility. In addition, it
was frequently possible for the observers to see the airplane, the UFO's
at the same time. It
seems unlikely that six airplane
crews and all their passengers were
befuddled.
Killian further declared that "no
experienced pilot is going to be de-
ceived like that. We all see stars
and clouds a thousand times this
same."
In addition, the only clouds
we had that night were broken
below us."
An Air Force spokesman public-
ly rebuked "flying saucers" -- he
pressed some sarcastic remarks
about their seeming "can't
remember anything when they sober
up next day." This statement was
reported in the New York Herald
Tribune.
COMMENT: Captain Killian
took particular exception to this
statement, pointing out that the Air
Force never produced the pilots who
drink before flights -- "it's one of
our strictest rules."
Donald Keyhoe, director of
NICAP, declared that the Air
Force spokesman's statement was
obviously meant to serve their own
purposes.
