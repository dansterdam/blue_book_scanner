The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book UFO report.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract and output all the text found in the document:

At 9:00 a.m., July 29, 1952, the FBI representative at Madison, Wisconsin, was contacted by representatives of OSI, Maxwell Field, Madison, Wisconsin. They advised that a strange device had been found in an open field near Madison, Wisconsin. The device was reported to have "MISS" stamped on it. The device was found by two boys, both of Palmyra, Wisconsin. Both boys are twenty-one years old.

Agents from the Madison Resident Agency proceeded to Palmyra. It was determined that the device is two inches in diameter and is dark yellow color. It was found with a string attached to it. A search was made into the field around where the device was found. There were no appreciable "burned" marks in the field. The device is cylindrical in shape and looks something like a tip of a bomb, and the string attached to it is approximately ten inches in length and was attached to the device. The device is four inches long and has one-eighth inch thick walls. It is made of a dark material which appears to be a poor quality steel or iron protruded from material that was hardened and used in the device where it was attached to the string.

Mr. of Palmyra advised that on Sunday, July 27, 1952, at about 9:30 a.m., he observed a strange light in the sky for about 15 minutes. He watched this light, which appeared to him to be about the size of a basketball, moving rapidly across the sky from east to west. He stated that the light gave off a bright reddish glow. It was his opinion that this light was not an airplane, as it moved too rapidly and at a constant altitude.

Preparations are being made by the Milwaukee Office to forward the device to the Technical Laboratory for appropriate examination.
