The image contains two sketches. The one on the left depicts a landscape with buildings and mountains, while the one on the right shows a person standing on a road with mountains in the background. There is also a smaller sketch in the lower right corner that shows a landscape with a curved horizon.

As an OCR system, I will now extract the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position where you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
