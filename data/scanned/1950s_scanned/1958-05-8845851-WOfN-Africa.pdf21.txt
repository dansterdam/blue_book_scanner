The image does not appear to contain a photograph. It is a typed document that describes an incident involving a person named Frank Russell and his "flying saucer". The document mentions that Russell had built a saucer-shaped contraption, which he had been using for about six months. It seems Russell had planned to sneak out and send the "gadget" up on a nylon line, but decided against it. The document also notes that Russell's wife did not know about his activities with the saucer.

The text in the document is as follows:

No Case (Information Only)
27 May 1958 
Biccleswade, England

Crowde, England, was subjected to a series of saucer boxes over a period of months by a man who finally confessed his drink voluntarily. The monster, named Frank Russell, built a contraction consisting of a saucer circumference five feet in diameter. It was reported he would fly this and cause to disappear it again when the spirit moved him. British authorities are undecided as to whether to prosecute or not.
