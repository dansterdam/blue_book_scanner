Pursuant to agreement reached in conference between Mr. White Stork and Mr. ATIG, it is requested that white Stork examine a sample of turf to determine the type that was furnished. An extensive examination is not to be conducted, as it is only desired to show that the turf submitted is not to be considered to contain unknown sources.
