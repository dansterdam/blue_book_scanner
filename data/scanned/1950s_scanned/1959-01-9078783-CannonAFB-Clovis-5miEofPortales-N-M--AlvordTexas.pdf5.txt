The image provided does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a page from an old UFO report document. The page is titled "UNCLASSIFIED" and contains a block of redacted or blacked-out text.

WAS MAKING A POSITION REPORT AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING AND DID NOT SEE THE OBJECT DUE TO THE DISTANCE. IT LAID OUT OF THE AREA OF OBSERVATION AND BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE COULD NOT BE ASCERTAINED TO BE THE MISSILE LAUNCHED FROM KNOWN IMPACT AREAS. INSUFFICIENT DATA TO DETERMINE FROM OBSERVATION. THIS REPORT WAS OBTAINED FROM INFORMATION PERTAINING TO EXPLOSION OBSERVED FROM A DISTANCE, SUBSEQUENTLY ASCERTAINED TO BE SIGHTING OF MISSILE LAUNCH FROM LAUNCH AREA.

OBSERVATION THIS BLANK OF RELIABILITY PREVENTS EXPLOITATION TO THREAT ASSESSMENT.

GENERALLY RULES OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF OPERATION BEING A HIGH PERFORMANCE VEHICLE FURTHER THE PROBABILITY OF POSITIONAL SIGHTING BEING A MISSILE SIGHTING.
