The page contains two photographs. The first photograph on the left is a dark image of what appears to be the sun partially eclipsed, with a bright, lightened area in the sky. The second photograph on the right shows what seems to be a single dark, circular object against a plain, light background, possibly the sky.

The text in the document reads:
