Dear Mr. 

This is in answer to your inquiry about the experience I had a few years ago on a sighting. The history on flying saucers being fairly well known, I personally must admit I looked upon this subject with considerable indifference when this happened. 

On or about August 20, 1956 or '57 (it's hard to pinpoint the exact date) I was sitting on my front porch during the evening when suddenly I glanced up and saw an object hovering about 50 feet above the trees on the edge of my front yard. This object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and about 6 feet thick at the center, where there seemed to be a dome. I at first thought it was a helicopter, but quickly realized it was not, for the craft made no sound and appeared to be motionless. As I gazed at it, it suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a terrific speed, disappearing within a second or two.

I stood there amazed and called to my husband who was in the house. Before he could come out, the object was gone. I immediately telephoned the sheriff's office to report what I had seen, but no one there seemed to take it very seriously.

Later that night, two boys who lived across the street from me also reported seeing the object. The next morning, when my husband went to work, he told some of his fellow workers about it, but they too seemed inclined to pass it off as my imagination.

I am not given to fantastic ideas or to a vivid imagination, and I know what I saw that evening. It was certainly no airplane, helicopter, or any other known aircraft. I have no desire to frighten or alarm anyone, but I felt I should report this incident, which was quite startling to me at the time. I hope you will find this report of some interest.

Sincerely,
