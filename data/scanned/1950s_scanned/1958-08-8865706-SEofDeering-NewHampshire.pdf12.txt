The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. The image shows a page from what appears to be an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text in the document appears to be a detailed written description of some kind of observation or event, though without more context it is difficult to discern the exact nature of the incident being described.

Dear Sirs:
My complaint and I shall be brief - on the night of August 15, 1958 at around 11:30 PM, I observed an object in the sky which I believe was a flying saucer of some kind. This object was moving at a high rate of speed and appeared to be approximately one-half the apparent size of the Moon. It was traveling in a westerly direction and was observed for a period of approximately 1 to 2 minutes. The object was observed from my home in Southeast of Deering, New Hampshire.
