The image appears to contain a handwritten document or report related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force project that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s. The document is dated July 29, 1957.

The text in the document states:

"Dear Sir:
About three years ago when I lived in North Hampton, Mass. I was called at the Easthampton Smith Co. in Florence, Mass. and a gentleman representing himself as an official from the Air Force quested certain information concerning sightings of unidentified flying objects. It was the claim on his part that these sightings had been brought to his attention and that he would like to have further information I could give him regarding the time and circumstances of this occurrence. As a result of this interview I was asked to sign a statement which I did.
Since that time I have followed with a great deal of interest the various reports of unidentified flying objects in the press and on television, feeling that perhaps my experience might be of value to someone making a serious study of the subject.
In view of recent reports of observations of unidentified flying objects in New Madrid, Missouri area, I am prompted to write and tell you of my experience. You may recall that this incident ocurred in the Florence area some three years ago. I could never learn from any Air Force officials what conclusions if any were reached as a result of my statement.
I am now living in Worcester, Mass. and if you feel that my experience might be of any value in your study of this subject I should be glad to discuss it with you further. I shall be most happy to cooperate in any way I can in your work.
Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
Worcester, Mass."
