OCT, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico
This Hq, 29/8/51 12
Two civilian witnesses, from their residence at 1212 East Copper Avenue, Albuquerque, New Mexico, observed an unconventional aircraft, chevron-shaped, about one and one half to twice the size of a B-36, traveling at an estimated speed of approximately 160 to 180 mph at an estimated altitude of 9,000 to 10,000 feet. This witnesses immediately reported this to OSI at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. OSI then notified this headquarters by telephone.
This observation of an assumed unconventional aircraft might be considered significant but for the fact that the sighting can be substantiated by only two witnesses and no other evidence.
