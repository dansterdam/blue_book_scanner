HILLS at the hoverir position, and as it traveled away, and seemed constant
as to size and color.

The pilot stated that at no time during their observation did the object
increase or decrease in altitude.

The weather, conditions at the time was 4/10 covered at 4,000 feet with base
at 4,500 feet variable. Visibility was 5 miles turbulence did ground 2-3 miles,
winds 270 velocity - 15 kts.  
Direction was unknown. 

The sun was to the rear of the F-94 as the plane was headed west. 
The observation was made from the F-94 fighter aircraft at an altitude of 
approximately 4,000 feet. The object was observed for about 2-3 minutes before it disappeared from sight.

1. Both pilots are in their initials and seemed to have level headed and reliable.

2. This report coincides and describes the position and characteristics of the first 
sighting, and no erratic or violent maneuvers were observed as described by other 
reports. The fact that they got a confirmed fix on the object is of value, although 
it is considered that their estimate of distance and dimension appear to be prone to 
variations.

3. This report is made to intelligence as per AR 95-62, dated 24 June 1949. Det 
1, 604th Air Intelligence Service, APO 970, reviewed the information contained in 
this report and has discussed this incident with the observer. 

The balloon, anchored at 50 feet, had observed by the same observer on 7 June 1952, 
this balloon, anchored was called by him to attention specifically for comparison of 
the object observed. On 7 June 1952 at approximately 1030 hours, a weather balloon 
was observed of known characteristics as to size, shape, and movement, having been
observed by the same crew in the same F-94 aircraft.  The balloon has been observed
at altitude of 48,000 feet. 

4. The reported position of this captive balloon is approximately 6 miles NNW of the F-94 fighter aircraft position. This captive balloon had been observed a time on
7 June 1952, and the crew definitely stated that the object observed on 9 June 1952 
was not the same balloon, the size and movement were different.

The wind at the time was from 270 degrees at 15 knots. This movement and the fact that 
no visible payout of line such as would be attached to a balloon could have caused this
reaction. The object made a sharp turn without a perceptible change of wind direction or
an air pocket could have caused this reaction.
