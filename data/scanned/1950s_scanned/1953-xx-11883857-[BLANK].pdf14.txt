**AFCIN-4
UFO Program
ACS/I (Major General Harold E. Watson)

1. As you know, this Center is responsible for performing a complete
analysis and evaluation of all UFO reports in accordance with the
provisions of AFR 200-2, dated 5 Feb 58. This analysis and evaluation,
of necessity, can be no better than the reported information with
which we must work. It has been determined at this Center that the
problems associated with this program are centered around the Air
Force's "reaction capability" (reporting and investigation). There is
a need to increase the speed of processing reports and of initiating
investigations and to improve the quality of both.

2. The reporting problem for the most part can be corrected by changes
to APR 200-2. These changes will effectively spell out in detail the
responsibilities of the base commanders and other organization
commanders, and expand on the information required in the initial
report. It is also contemplated making APR 200-2 a "special subject
regulation" of air inspectors for a period of one year following the
effective date of these changes.

3. APR 200-2 presently spells out the nearest Air Force base
commander as responsible for the investigation of UFO's. As has already
been pointed out this has proved unsatisfactory. The 1006th AISS,
due to its geographical deployment is the most logical organization
to perform the investigative function. It is suggested that AFCIN-4A
be instructed to include the investigation of UFO sightings in the
new charter for the 1006th AISS.

4. The ATIC will make provisions to give special training to at least
one individual from each detachment, preferably a commissioned
officer, who will then become primarily responsible for UFO investigations.
