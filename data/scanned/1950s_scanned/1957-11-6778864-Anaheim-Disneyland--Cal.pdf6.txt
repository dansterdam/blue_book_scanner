CASE FILE
TO: AFOIM-X1, Major Byrne
DATE 25 NOV 1957
FROM: AFOIM-4
COMMENT NO. 1
Remarks (Use reverse if necessary):
1. Reference our teletype message dated 18 Nov 1957 regarding analysis of Anaheim UFO incident, a copy attached.
2. Review of circumstances surrounding the incident, from additional information, result of investigations indicate this is an attempted hoax, as radar data, GOC posts, military and civil aircraft logs reveal no number of local population in the area reported. 
3. Upon query to this Center regarding this case, Major Tucker, SAFIS, was informed results of investigation, analysis and photos would be available from your office.
