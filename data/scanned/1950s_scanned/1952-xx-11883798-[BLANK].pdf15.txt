The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s. The document outlines proposals for handling the UFO situation, including having the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) alone handle Project Blue Book and receive all reports, consider and segregate them, and prepare and furnish reports on the sightings. The document also proposes having an advisory committee and a contractor technical group to assist with the project.

Output from the document:

Your letter of the fifth is acknowledged. We are glad to obtain your general concurrence with our recommendations. There appear to be three possible methods of handling the situation, one of which is at present utilized.

PROPOSAL I. - (ATIC alone)
a. Project Blue Book to be handled by ATIC alone. There is no organized outside help.
b. ATIC would receive all reports, consider and segregate them into two categories: (1) "ACTION," for immediate processing in a numbered folder; and (2) "NO ACTION," for ATIC reference file.
c. ATIC would prepare and furnish AFOIN-2 with a flash report, an interim report and a numbered folder containing a completed action report on each "action" sighting.
d. ATIC would prepare and furnish AFOIN-2 with semi-annual reports on the situation. These reports would list all sightings during the period, with individual aircraft, action, conclusion and recapitulation of origins (planet Venus, balloons, mirages, etc., unknown, etc.)

PROPOSAL II. - (ATIC plus Contract Technical Group plus Advisory Committee)
a. High Level Advisory Committee
1. Would be exceed three people
2. Would act as counselor to ATIC
3. Chairman would act as high level spokesman on Blue Book matters for USAF

NOTE: Suggested names might include General Doolittle, a member of the scientific advisory board; others of similar experience.

b. Contractor Technical Group
1. Contractor could set up technical group (not exceeding three persons) of scientific personnel to whom data on all sightings would be furnished in a numbered folder for immediate consideration.
