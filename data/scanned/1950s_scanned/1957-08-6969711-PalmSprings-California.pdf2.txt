Dear Allen:

Are these things going? 
Enclosed is a copy of a letter from a logistician who thought he detected what he called "a slight deviation from normal" on the trajectory of the satellite going over his station recently.

I thought you might be interested to take a look at this - I don't know what to make of it myself. However, we have made a study of it here, and with the "errors" due to station errors and other factors, it would seem that there is little or no basis for inferring anything unusual. 

Yet the writer seems quite exercised about the matter and thinks it should be checked. What do you think? Any comments?

I hope all is going well with you - I would appreciate hearing from you when you have a moment.

With cordial regards,

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
