There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book. The text in the document is as follows:

5 January 1959

Dear Mr. _____,

I am re-turning herewith the film you submitted to the United States Air Force for evaluation which you thought contained an unidentified flying object.

The Air Technical Intelligence Center had these portions of the data containing the original unidentified flying objects enlarged. However, the enlargements did not reveal any more detail than did the observations of the projected image on the screen.

The analysis of the film indicates the object was stationary, and was photographed for a considerable length of time, approximately six minutes. This would indicate the object appeared and knowing the running rate of the camera used.

It is the opinion of the ATIC that this is a photograph of a reflection.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
