NOTES FROM ORIGINAL PHONE CALL TO CHICAGO FILTER CENTER,
1 JUNE 1953, 1600c.

JRG Talked to Lt. Walters, USAF, Operations Officer, CHI. :

O.R. ANZ236, Monroe, Wise.
Chief Observer : "Astronomer" observer:
31 May 53, 0430 to 1005c.

what about the possibility that it was Venus - that the condition of the atmosphere was just right to produce "wandering" effect and enable it to be seen after the sun was quite high.

If this were true, then the Radar blip would have to be accounted for otherwise.

Q: Did the object change position with respect to the sun? 
This would make or break the Venus theory.
