Foster: But this was on a screen?
Neff: Well actually we don't know if the silhouette they referred to was a regular silhouette or a visual. But Watertown could see it and they're quite a ways north of Griffiss, and Albany saw it and they're quite a ways to the east somewhere on Lake Ontario and it asked them man and they all saw it and noticed....and they looked over to the west and saw it right away.
