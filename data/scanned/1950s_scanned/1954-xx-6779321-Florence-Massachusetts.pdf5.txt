BUREAU OF SHIPS
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

IN REPLY REFER TO

Ser 110-984
Car 110-1984

Northampton, Massachusetts 

My dear friend:

This is in reply to your letter of 30 July 1957 telling of an unusual experience you had. First, I want to thank you for reporting this incident, and I believe it might be the basis for testing telephone equipment from the bottom of the sea. 

The Navy is always interested to hear new ideas for improving its equipment, and it is particularly pleased to hear from individual citizens who wish to bring these matters to the Navy's attention. The Navy is constantly receiving many suggestions for improvements and it is always glad to consider them. I believe that our knowledge of these matters has advanced to the point where we will be able to make use of your idea which you have so kindly submitted to us.

It is my understanding that the Department of the Air Force is coordinating all reports in identified flying objects and can be consulted for further information on this matter. I am referring your letter to that Department for evaluation and further reply to you.

Sincerely yours,

L. Miller
Deputy for Legislation & Liaison
