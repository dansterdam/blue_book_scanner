I don't believe the blue-white light came from the same source as the original sighting's source. The incident's peculiarities are indivcative of little confirmatory value. I agree perhaps the incident's significance was overexaggerated on the report, and personnel read something unusual into an incident which they normally would have recognized or have dismissed as of no consequence.
