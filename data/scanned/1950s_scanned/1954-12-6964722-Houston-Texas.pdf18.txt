Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing only text.

Dr. Kaplan which showed tin from the usual impurities found in what aluminum: the usual impurities found in the sample and possessed none seemed to indicate the material was genuine. A careful search was made to see if any trace of antimony was present in the sample. It seem that a trace of antimony was found in the sample and used in conjunction to the tin an antifounging used in forging of aluminum alloys. The density of this small sample was found to be 10.3 whereas the density of tin as given in published tables is 7.3. There was no further evidence to indicate the sample was tin.

Prior to the letter of Dr. Kaplan's findings which dealt with the chemistry of the sample, much importance was attached to the fact that the sample was found and there even a widespread and exiting feeling that some new and exciting discovery has been made which would be of great importance to the world and dealing with "flying saucers". Unfortunately, this feeling had to be discarded and it was found that this was no more than a piece of tin. This seems much more exasperating to me as the physicist who has been at work in this field of ultra high speed flight and the defense problems associated therewith than it would be to the layman or the average person. 

Assuming that the density of 10.3 is correct, (and in my opinion it is after having thouroughly checked the procedure) this sample is composed of 75% lead and 25% tin or something very close to this density. It may also be that this is a fusible alloy which may have some other use, however, the sample in question does not appear to be anything new or exciting. More records will be searched to determine its actual identity or origin but it seems unlikely to be other than a common industrial alloy.
