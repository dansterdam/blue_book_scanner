** STATEMENT **

I observed an unidentified flying object at about 22:00 hours, CST,
27 December 1952, approximately 20 miles South of Canadian, Texas. I
and four other occupants of the car all observed the following phenomena,
and at the time of sighting the night was cold and clear.

I was driving South on US Highway 83 when an intense blueish-white
light caught my attention. The light was comparable to that light which
is emitted from the center of a blue light bulb We were traveling at
a fairly rapid speed and it took but a few minutes before the car could be
pulled over to the side of the road, however, the object when first sighted
was about five degrees to the left of the road.

The object's size was comparable to a baseball and flew at about
two to three thousand feet. The object when first sighted appears
In the Southeast and flew a straight level course to the Northeast.
Then the object passed over the highway on which we were traveling,
it was approximately two to three miles in front of us. As the object
crossed the road it must have been traveling about 300 miles per hour,
but as it continued it seemed to gain velocity.

One thing that I feel is worth mentioning is the fact that in the
two to three minutes that we observed the object no sound was heard.
The intense blueish-white light which emitted fire and yellow as or
fumes from the rear disappeared by going out of our sight range.

I certify that the statement above is true and correct to the best
of my knowledge.
