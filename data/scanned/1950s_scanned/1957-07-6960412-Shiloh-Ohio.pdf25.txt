EXAMINATION OF A STONE

A large, black stone, reported to be a stony meteorite, was received for examination, particularly from the standpoint of aerodynamic lines of flow. 

The stone shows no signs of air-flow lines such as are found on meteorites. The markings visible on the surface of the stone represent material in the bedding planes of a sedimentary rock; this material has a hardness somewhat greater than that of the matrix.

The aerodynamic flow lines have an appearance and arrangement that are completely different from the markings on the stone in question. On a meteorite, flow lines would not protrude so far from the surface; they would be arranged to slide from the front and rear elongation points. A joint or crack region would be recognized. The front face would be smooth, with protuberances either melted off or with characteristic pits in front of them and behind them. The back face would show a typical molted appearance due to chilling pitching. In none of these characteristics does the stone in question resemble a meteorite.

The stone is clearly of sedimentary origin. It shows bedding planes with pebbles at least one of the planes is clearly granular. It is concluded that the stone is indurated due to some inhomogeneity at the center, possibly a fossil, as is commonly observed in the sandstones found in the eastern part of Ohio. Weathering has removed the softer formation around the stone, leaving pebbles and induration between layers of the indurated sandstone, in the fashion.

The matrix material is surprised to be a feldspathic sandstone.

In composition, the rock does not resemble a meteorite; there is no granite in such bodies, but usually unaltered, olivine, forsterite, etc. are present. Meteorites do not contain pebbles.
