STATEMENT

I was called from my hotel room early Wednesday morning, 30 July (approximately Central Standard time 0035) by Lt. Albright. He stated that he had just interviewed a man who said he had seen a flying object take off but had examined it on the ground. He asked that I join him at the Office Center to hear the man's immediate statement, which I did. 

While being unaccountable in my replies I made the following observations:

Mr. --- is a man of middle age, of medium height, dark brown hair and has a very deliberate conversation and voice with a slight German accent. He seemed excited in his conversation and spoke with a great deal of sincerity. He did reiterate the fact that he had seen the object take off and its disappearance. He told me that his wife was with him and did not want her to know where he was now. He was concerned regarding his identity and the possibility of his wife finding out. He said that he had no reason for telling anything but the truth, and only wanted to get the subject off his mind.

I followed through on the interrogation made by Lt. Albright and the Operations Officer of the 138th AC&W Squadron who gathered the information by phone (as the man was reluctant to come to the office). They prepared a detailed description of the object. He never wavered in his story and the following items did weaken my belief in his story:

a. The fact that he had waited a week before disclosing the story.
b. Why would he mention that he had a camera in his car and not think to use it?
c. The loss of the stamp that he thought came from the cigarette package.
d. His story about his wife and his reluctance for any publicity.
