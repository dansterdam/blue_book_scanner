The text in the document is as follows:

On Monday, 12 May 1952, during the period 2045 - 2110 hours MST, T/Sgt RICHARD BARE, AF-15257279, United States Air Force, observed a very bright glowing object in the sky. The object appeared to be at an altitude of about 25,000 feet over the mountains east of Ruidoso, New Mexico, about 50 miles west of Roswell.

The object at first appeared to be a star, but after a few minutes it noticed that its blue-green color rapidly changing in intensity from very bright to dim.

The object pursued a definite course, which is estimated to have been approximately 30 to 40 miles per minute. While watching the object, I noticed two motions: one, a swaying movement from South to North, the other a movement across the terrain from South to North. The object then climbed almost perpendicularly to the terrain to between 40,000 to 50,000 feet, and then descended, as an angle of 45 degrees. This cycle was repeated twice, for a total of three cycles. The speed of the object was unsteady, but I could not estimate the length of the object's various courses, nor the length of time that is remained on any one course or altitude.

The color of the object changed rapidly from dim blue-green while traveling straight and level to a very bright blue-green while climbing and descending. The object's shape appeared to be that of a disc.
