Have seen these quite many times. Every time these people and officer in different action and usually some what in front of them may appear to be standing side way or the front way and seem to come right toward the house. One night was watching what appear to be a light that look just like a star but and it seem to come right toward the house. Both fields in front and one divided by stone wall seem to light up fairly bright with an red glow. This was not military flight.
