The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report on a UFO sighting. The page contains a sketch diagram with instructions for the observer to draw the path and shape of the observed object.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

Overhead
Horizon --------------- You --------------- Horizon

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.
