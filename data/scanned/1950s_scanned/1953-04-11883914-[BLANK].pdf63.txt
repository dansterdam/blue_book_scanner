The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, containing text discussing the observations of astronomers regarding green fireballs.

Astronomer JJ has made no sightings himself, but agrees on the policy of reporting to a duly constituted panel if he should see anything.
Astronomer LK has made no sightings and was not particularly interested in the problem.
Astronomer LL, Dr. La Paz, has already had so much publicity in Life magazine that there appears to be no reason for keeping his name secret. He is the Director of the Institute of Meteoritics at the University of New Mexico, and is cooperative in the extreme. One sighting of his has been described in Life magazine and also fully in OSI reports. He has made extensive reports about the green fireball sightings in New Mexico in OSI reports also.
The discussion of green fireballs with many astronomers disclosed that most of them were of the opinion that these were natural objects. However, close questioning revealed that they knew nothing of the actual sightings, or their frequency or anything much about them, and therefore cannot be taken seriously. This is characteristic of scientists in general when speaking about subjects which are not in their own immediate field of concern.
Dr. La Paz has seen only one green fireball himself, but has been avid in collecting reports on the others. Because his full reports are in the CSI files, only the salient points will be discussed here. It appears that the green fireballs can be characterized as being extremely bright, most of them lighting up the sky in the daytime, estimated magnitude -12, which is extremely bright. They appear to come in bunches and at one time 10 were observed in 13 days. No noise is associated with them despite their brightness.
