The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" on the left side, and a curved line labeled "B" on the right side. This appears to be an illustration demonstrating how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it.

The second sketch shows a larger landscape view, with a person standing in the foreground and a hilly, wooded horizon in the background.

The third sketch shows a smaller landscape view, with a distant horizon line and some clouds or hills in the background.
