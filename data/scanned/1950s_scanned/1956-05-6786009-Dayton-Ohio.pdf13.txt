He reports that the light was approximately 400-500 feet above the ground and left no trail or exhaust. The light appeared to be the size of a medium-sized aircraft and appeared to be elongated or cigar-shaped in form. After observing it for approximately 30 seconds, it suddenly accelerated and moved rapidly to the south, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. The cadet stated that this was the only incident of its kind that he had ever witnessed.
