JULY 
WORLD SCIENCE REVIEW

When I visited New Mexico in Nov-
ember 1949, I sought out the group
of journalists and investigators who
had been probing Villanueva's
thoroughly since the occurrence.
They were most helpful and arranged
for me to have a long talk with the
man. I could interview him person-
ally, give me every information
he chose to trust to me - a most
being. the kind of man you would
trust to talk to you frankly for a
serious matter. And if you were
if suddenly called away, I liked him
very much, and I thoroughly believe
his story.

That I am not alone. All who have
investigated him have come to the
same conclusion. On one occasion
Mr. and Mrs. Chet Barker came from
California to see him, and they, too,
cum with a group of investigators
and journalists, to find nothing to
take of control. They had to pull
in beside the road where he had
parked his broken-down car, and
set up with his stick the fine of
the ship take off.

Landing Place Discovered
The party followed this line until
they came across a landing place with
burned grass and four deep holes
down by some heavy objects within a
circle, crushed by these objects. At
one point on the farther line they
moved the stick about fifteen degrees.
And when they resumed the measurements, it moved to a new point in a
direction, it studied the line of sight
carefully and maintained the stick on
the new point. It was quite clear that
it was observing the stick move, and
because it had passed the exact
measurement which indicated its line
of approach, it moved the stick to
appear on false-off.

We could not photograph it, but I
had a chance to see them demonstrate for
myself when we took the measurements.

a man, his family, his job.
ng the things he knew to be

as he would to afraid to leave them,

He could hardly believe what had
happened to him!

The landing place they discovered
shows that Villanueva was telling the
truth. Another man in Mexico has since
then had a more amazing experience.
