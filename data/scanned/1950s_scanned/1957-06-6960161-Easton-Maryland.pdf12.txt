Dear Sir:

We are in receipt of your letter dated 8 July 1957 in which you report an unidentified flying object observed by you on the night of 3 June 1957.

This sighting has not been conclusively identified as yet. You are correct in stating that it was not one of the known Air Force balloons or other military aircraft and air training and other operations. A plot of the location given within a radius of 20 miles from three air bases in the area is enclosed.

There is no evidence that your may have observed a series of lights underneath an aircraft's defined for the purpose of testing ground-controlled approach equipment. A copy of your prompt reporting of the incident to proper authorities, and your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM W. LLOYD
Captain, USAF
Assistant Adjutant
