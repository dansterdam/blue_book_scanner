On 25 January 1951 at 18.20 o'clock while on a routine training mission a object of unknown characteristics was observed by the pilot and navigator of one of the aircraft of this command.

The object appeared to be at an estimated altitude of 12-15,000 feet and was moving at an estimated speed of 400-600 mph. It was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes before it disappeared from sight. The pilot and navigator stated that they could not determine the size, shape or color of the object as it appeared to be a point of light only. They indicated that the object was not blinking nor did it appear to have exhaust or trail of any kind. The object was observed to make an abrupt 90 degree turn and then disappear.
