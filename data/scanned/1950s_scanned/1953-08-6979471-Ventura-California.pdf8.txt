SUMMARY: [Content redacted]
2. Object sited: The object appeared to be circling and appeared to be the size of a B-29 bomber. It was at an estimated distance of about 2 miles and at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. The object was observed by an Air Force Radar Observer at Radar Station and by a Civilian and Air Force Observatory. 
3. Color of object: The color appeared to be in three appearances and red in another. In the latter instance, observers reported the possible object close to another, one red.
4. Attitude of object: Unknown. Sound, trail or exhaust not detectable.
5. Observers: Reliable. There are encircled as points from which the object was observed. 
6. The aircraft was in vicinity of observation area, but neither observer nor any other aircraft in the area.
7. The possibility is that the object might have been a light or lights sighted but they were too distant for conclusive observation or correlated with some known object in the area seen under unusual atmospheric conditions and very unusual aerial phenomena.
COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
1. This report of observation is viewed as of doubtful significance due to the casual nature of the observation and the failure either to properly identify the object or to obtain sufficiently detailed information about its appearance and performance to categorize it conclusively.
2. Recommend that this report be recorded and placed in Blue Book files.
