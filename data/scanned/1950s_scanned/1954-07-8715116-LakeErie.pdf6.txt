"HERE WAS A SAUCER-SHAPED OBJECT THAT HAD BEEN SEEN AND THAT HAD LANDED.
HOWEVER, THE WITNESSES DID NOT FEEL THAT THIS WAS SUFFICIENT CAUSE FOR ME TO MAKE A TRIP THERE. THEY ASKED ME TO COME ONLY IF FURTHER SIGHTINGS WERE MADE.

ON OCTOBER 3, 1954 A COLONEL R. J. O'BRIEN, WHO STATED HE WAS CHIEF OF OPERATIONS FOR THE EASTERN AIR DEFENSE FORCE, CONTACTED THIS OFFICE AND STATED THAT A LANDING OF A DISK-SHAPED OBJECT HAD BEEN REPORTED ON THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER 1, 1954 ON A FARM NEAR BUFFALO, NEW YORK. THAT OBJECT, ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, HAD LANDED IN A FIELD AND LEFT IMPRESSIONS IN THE GROUND THAT WERE SUBSEQUENTLY MEASURED AND PHOTOGRAPHED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AIR FORCE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE COLONEL STATED THAT A COPY OF THE REPORT AND PHOTOS HAD BEEN FORWARDED TO THE DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE, WASHINGTON, D.C. IT WAS REQUESTED THAT I CONTACT THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED AND OBTAIN ALL POSSIBLE DETAILS.

I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE BUFFALO OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND WAS ADVISED THAT THEY HAD BEEN AWARE OF THE INCIDENT AND HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH OFFICERS OF THE EASTERN AIR DEFENSE FORCE. THEY STATED, HOWEVER, THAT THEY FELT THE MATTER WAS OF SUCH A NATURE THAT THEY PREFERRED NOT TO BECOME DIRECTLY INVOLVED, AND THAT I SHOULD CONTACT THE MILITARY REPRESENTATIVES CONCERNED.

AAA PERSONNEL WERE CONTACTED BUT THEY REFUSED TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH ME OR CONFIRM ANY OF THE DETAILS. THE FARM OWNERS WERE ALSO CONTACTED BUT THEY STATED THAT THEY PREFERRED NOT TO DISCUSS THE INCIDENT AND FELT IT BEST TO REMAIN SILENT ABOUT IT.

SINCE IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FURTHER DETAILS FROM THESE SOURCES, AND WITHOUT THE COOPERATION OF THE MILITARY OR THE FARM OWNERS, I DID NOT FEEL THAT A TRIP TO THE SITE WOULD BE PRODUCTIVE AT THAT TIME. HOWEVER, I HAVE REQUESTED THAT IF FURTHER INFORMATION IS DEVELOPED ON THIS INCIDENT, THAT I BE NOTIFIED."
