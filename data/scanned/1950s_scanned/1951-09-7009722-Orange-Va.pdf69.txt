Opinion Divided Over Reports Of 
Objects Seen In Lubbock Skies

The reports of unidentified flying objects seen over Lubbock during the past week have divided public opinion. Some say they were fireballs, others that they were guided missiles or aircraft, while still others insist they were true "flying saucers."

The sightings began late Monday night when several persons reported seeing a formation of bright lights moving rapidly across the sky. The reports continued through Tuesday and Wednesday nights, with some witnesses claiming they saw as many as 40 or 50 of the objects. 

However, the United States Weather Bureau said that no weather balloons or other instruments were released over Lubbock Monday or Tuesday nights. Some observers said the objects appeared to be controlled and maneuverable.

Opinion Divided
Opinions appear to be about evenly divided as to the nature of the objects. Some say they were merely reflections of automobile lights or other ordinary phenomena. Others insist that they were genuinely unidentified flying objects, possibly guided missiles or aircraft.
