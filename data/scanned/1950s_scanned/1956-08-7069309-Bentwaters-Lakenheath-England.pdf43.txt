TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

REPORT NO.: 8-1-56
The unidentified flying object was picked up at an estimated 20 to 30 miles east-southeast of Bentwaters and flew a constant course of about 270 to the northeast at an estimated speed of 700 to 800 miles per hour. This speed was calculated by estimating the lapsed time that the object was in the vicinity of the VORTAC stations as approximately 20 miles west and it was estimated that the object covered this distance in approximately 1.5 minutes. The electronic counter measures and radar operators stated that some view of the speed of the object could be obtained by the revolution of the A/Z2 indicator, and that this indicated a speed of approximately 600 to 800 miles per hour.
The unidentified flying object was tracked by two separate radar stations VORTAC and CPS-5 in the vicinity of Bentwaters and Lakenheath, England. These radar stations tracked the object and the visual observers also saw the object pass through the sky. The visual observers estimated the altitude of the object at 3000 feet.
