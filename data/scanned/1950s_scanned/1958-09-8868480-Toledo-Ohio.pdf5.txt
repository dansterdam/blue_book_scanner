Dear Sir,

An attempt was made to analyze the photographic prints you submitted to the Air Force. They are of such quality that an accurate evaluation cannot be made.

Request the negative be forwarded to this Center in order for us to make a more accurate evaluation of the object concerned.

Sincerely,
