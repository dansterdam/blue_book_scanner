The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the left shows a curved line with markings on it, accompanied by instructions to imagine the viewer is at the point "A" on the curved line and that the object was above the horizon (skyline) when first seen. The smaller sketch on the right shows a road or path leading away with hills or mountains in the distance.

In the larger sketch, the instructions state to place a point "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when last seen.

The text instructs the viewer to refer to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
