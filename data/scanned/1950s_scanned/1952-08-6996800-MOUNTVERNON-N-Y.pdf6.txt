14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
It disappeared _into the cloud bank_

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? 
Circle One:   Yes   No   Don't know.   If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind.
_It moved into and out of the clouds several times_

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?
(Circle One:) Yes   No   Don't know.   IF you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of.

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound _same as jet_
b. Color _bright silvery_

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or a man's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered. This will give the angular diameter of the object. If you had performed this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered?
_practically all of the object would have been covered_

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the shape, such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
