The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a newspaper clipping with the headline "It's Only Star, Folks! 'Thing,' Is Identified From Plane Window". The text describes an unidentified object that was observed from an airplane window and later determined to be a star. There are no human faces or names mentioned in the text.

"It's Only Star, Folks! 
"Thing' Is Identified 
From Plane Window

At about 6,000 feet up on a night flight near Dayton, Ohio one of the passengers in an airliner got excited about a fiery object that was streaking through the sky. He quickly awakened a woman sittIng next to him and said: "Look at that! What is it?"

The woman looked and saw a brilliant star that seemed much brighter and bigger than most. But it was not a star, officials later determined after checking the time and location with astronomical data.

What the passenger had seen, it was explained, was the planet Venus, which at certain times of the year appears as an exceptionally brilliant "star" in the night sky.

But many people do not know that Venus can at times seem so bright and large that it is mistaken for some kind of "flying saucer" or other strange aerial phenomenon. When viewed from an airplane window, especially, it can take on an unusual appearance.

According to the report, the fiery "thing" the passenger saw appeared to be "hurtling" through the sky. Actually, Venus was simply shining with exceptional brilliance, appearing larger than usual, as it often does at certain seasons.

The two-engine Convair was flying at about 6,000 feet and the "thing" was observed through the plane window. Capt. A.J. Amato, the pilot, said he saw the same object and at first thought it might be a meteor. But he soon realized it was Venus.

Those aboard the airliner who saw the object were greatly excited about it. But the Cincinnati Astronomical Society later explained that the "thing" was merely the planet Venus appearing in an unusually brilliant and magnified form through the airplane window.

Very few people, it seems, know that under certain conditions planets like Venus can appear to be strange, unidentified flying objects. So the next time you see a brilliant "star" or "light" in the sky that seems to be acting strangely, it's a good idea to check with astronomers before assuming it's a flying saucer."
