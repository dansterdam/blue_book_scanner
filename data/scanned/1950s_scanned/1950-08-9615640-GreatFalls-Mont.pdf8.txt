The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document containing text detailing requirements for a project, likely related to Project Blue Book.

Requirements
1. 2 color duplicates and 1 black & white print (exclusive of portion with sound track which is spliced to the end of the film).
2. Require the original be handled with utmost care (it is already in fairly poor condition, and we are very anxious that it suffer no further damage).
3. Request the original be cleaned as carefully as possible prior to duplication.
4. Request utmost effort in controlling duplication to extent that resulting copies will be as identical to original as possible in image and color reproduction.
5. The loose (unspliced) portion of 17 frames belongs at the end of the footage having a deep blue background and no sound track. The last frame of this loose portion is immediately adjacent to the splice with the broken frames having the sound track.
6. Can the stripped sprocket holes in the loose portion of the original (see 5) be repaired in any way - sufficiently to make it possible to run this part along with the remainder of film without malfunction?
