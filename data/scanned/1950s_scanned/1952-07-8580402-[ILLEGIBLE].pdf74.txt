STATEMENT:

At approximately 2130, on 18 July 1952, I was in the Mobile Control Van at Osterburg Air Force Base, Manchester, New Hampshire.

When I observed a bright comet-type object descending through the trees, at a speed comparable to a fast jet aircraft. It appeared to be moving from northwest to southeast. At a shallow angle of descent at a speed comparable to a fast jet aircraft. The object seemed to be below ten thousand feet although I could not pinpoint the exact altitude. I observed it for approximately 45 seconds to 1 minute, during which time I could plainly see a definite trail (short) and a bright glow within the object (something like burning magnesium). At the time it appeared directly over Manchester, suddenly disappeared from the object and a few seconds later a puff of smoke came from the area where the object had been. It would seem that the main body of the object had descended to earth, creating the impression the object or similar size has crashed or came down.

In conclusion I believe the object to be a meteorite or similar heavenly body.
