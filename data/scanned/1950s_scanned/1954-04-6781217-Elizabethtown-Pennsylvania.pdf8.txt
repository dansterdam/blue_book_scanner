TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

Statement is as follows: 
On the above date while I was searching the sky I saw a light which I recognized as an extraordinary object. After a few minutes passed it disappeared towards the east across my field of view. 
Shortly after a few minutes passed I returned to my home and called Olmsted Air Force Base. The telephone operator at Olmsted informed my call to Hight.

Sir, I am an individual who made the call in flight operations as notified in reference to the extraordinary object seen by me in flight. The object was circular in shape and highly illuminated. It appeared to be about twice the size of a medium bomber airplane at an elevation of about 30 degrees. The object was observed for about 2 to 3 minutes and then disappeared in a high speed to the east across my field of view.

The object appeared to have no exhaust or trail of any kind as it moved across the sky. It appeared to be self illuminated and did not blink or change color. The speed at which it disappeared was greatly in excess of anything I have ever seen in the sky before.

The above is a factual statement to the best of my knowledge and belief.

30 April 1954

This statement is provided to assist an official investigation that has been instituted as a result of the reported sighting.
