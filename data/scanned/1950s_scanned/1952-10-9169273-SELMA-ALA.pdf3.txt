THE WACO GENERAL DEPOT 
WACO, TEXAS

STATEMENT:

On 28 April 1952, I a civilian was driving along a road which intersected a highway near a local Texaco gas station, when I noticed an object in the sky at about 30 degrees elevation and about thirty degrees to the east of my position. The object appeared to be traveling at a very high speed and made no sound. It was brilliantly illuminated as if on fire. I watched the object for about thirty seconds as the brilliance gradually changed from red to yellowish-white.

I am the only one who saw this object, as my neighbor called to me while I was watching it. The observation took place at about 9:00 P.M.
