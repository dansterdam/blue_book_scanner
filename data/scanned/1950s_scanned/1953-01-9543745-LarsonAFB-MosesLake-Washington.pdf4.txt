The text describes the sighting of a green disk-shaped object, the size of a large weather balloon, that decreased in size until disappearing. The object was observed by at least 63 reliable witnesses, including personnel from a fighter interceptor squadron. No sound was heard, and the speed of the object was not observed. The object was seen at an altitude of about 12,000 feet, below a high cloud layer.
