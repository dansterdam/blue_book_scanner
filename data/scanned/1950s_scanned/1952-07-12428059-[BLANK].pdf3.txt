CAPTAIN JAMES: Not to people that understand what's

THE PRESS: Then the experienced operators really

CAPTAIN JAMES: That's correct.

THE PRESS: How about the CAA men?

CAPTAIN JAMES: I don't know.

THE PRESS: Would the disappearance or reappearance 
of these blips he accounted for by the movement of a cloud 
bank that reflected a ground target?

CAPTAIN JAMES: Well, actually, it's not a cloud 
bank. It's a temperature inversion of the atmosphere. You 
see, If warm air comes in over a cool area, you have a 
temperature inversion and the atmosphere can be perfectly 
clear, and still the rays will be bent.

THE PRESS: Would that account for the fact that 
these images disappeared and reappeared on these screens 
recently?

CAPTAIN JAMES: I'm not positive about that. There's 
a possibility.

THE PRESS: Captain, was there temperature Inversion 
in this area last Saturday night?

CAPTAIN JAMES: There was. 

THE PRESS: And the Saturday night preceding?

CAPTAIN JAMES: I'm not sure about the one preceding, 
but there was last Saturday night.

THE PRESS: Was there one last night?

CAPTAIN JAMES: I don't know.

THE PRESS: Captain, did any two sets in this area 
get a fix on these so-called saucers around here?

CAPTAIN JAMES: The information we have isn't good 
enough to determine that.
