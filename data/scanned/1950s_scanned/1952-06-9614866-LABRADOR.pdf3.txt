"FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
March 25, 1952

A Lieut. W. E. Eanett (PSYC) reported that, while doing airborne navigation work over Labrador, he and his copilot sighted a luminous object in the sky. This object appeared to be 20 to 30 feet in length, approximately one-half second. It appeared to be a long flash of light, and this lighting occurred over a period of approximately 30 seconds. The object was observed to be moving in a straight line at a very high speed. As soon as this lighting ceased, it disappeared completely, leaving no visible trail. The pilots believe that this object was not a meteor, shooting star, or any other normal heavenly body, as it did not have the characteristics of any of these. In their opinion, this was definitely an unidentified flying object."
