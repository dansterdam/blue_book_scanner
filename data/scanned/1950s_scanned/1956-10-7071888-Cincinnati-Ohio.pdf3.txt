The image does not contain any photograph. The text appears to be a detailed report on a UFO sighting incident that occurred in Cincinnati, Ohio on October 7, 1956. The report was written by Thomas M. Comella and appears to be part of Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).

The text of the report is as follows:

EXCLUSIVE! For the last few months TRC has been extensively investigating the sightings of unidentified flying objects in the Cleveland-Akron, Ohio, area. We have reason to believe that these incidents formed one of the most comprehensive cases of its kind to be found anywhere.

On October 7, 1956, at approximately 7:30 P.M. EST, a number of witnesses near the Technical Intelligence Center at Wright Patterson Field, Dayton, Ohio, observed a strange luminous object maneuver over the area for approximately fifteen minutes. These unidentified flying objects are controlled by extra-terrestrial intelligence according to our information.

On this occasion, the object was sighted by several witnesses north on Kauffman Road in Cleveland. The object was described as being approximately 50-60 feet in diameter, luminous, and disc-shaped. Its maneuvers were erratic, at times hovering, and at other times traveling at tremendous speeds estimated at 2,000 mph. Its movements were observed to be absolutely silent. The military and Air Force officials at the scene were greatly excited and perplexed by this strange phenomenon.

I phoned my report to other investigators in the area with whom we had been working. This is the first comprehensive report we are making public. The conclusions drawn from this investigation will be presented in a later and more complete report.

The incident was also witnessed by Mr. Al Roush, who lives in South Euclid, an eastern suburb of Cleveland. Mr. Roush stated that he was awakened about 7:30 P.M. by a brilliant light in his room. Looking out the window, he observed a large, luminous, circular object hovering in the sky. The object then accelerated at a fantastic rate of speed and disappeared. This occurred on the same evening and at the same time as the incident reported above.

The conclusions drawn follow:
1) Unidentified flying objects have been sighted in the Cleveland-Akron area with increasing frequency over the last few months.
2) These objects appear to be under intelligent control.
3) The objects are not of this earth - their maneuvers prove this conclusively.
4) The Air Force has been closely investigating these incidents, but the nature and purpose of the strange objects remain a mystery.

To establish the unknown classification, Al Roush spoke to the military authorities whose business it is to know what goes on in the sky. The Military Safety Division of the C.A.A., told TRC that the identity of the object sighted by Mr. Roush was unknown, and that it was not an aircraft known to be operating in this area.

Needless to say, with Mr. Gotha's appearance on the Cleveland Test, the story took on more significance. For the unusual sightings on this evening had a number of independent witnesses.

I understand, however, that the interim report will be made shortly, and the final and complete report will be available at a later date. The unusual nature of this incident warrants immediate and detailed investigation.
