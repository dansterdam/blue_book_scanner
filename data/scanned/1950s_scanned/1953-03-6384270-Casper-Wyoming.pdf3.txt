The image does not contain a photograph but a hand-drawn diagram or map. The diagram appears to show the layout of an area with annotations indicating directions, distances, and features related to an observation, perhaps of a UFO, as it would relate to Project Blue Book. There is a line marked as the "FLIGHT LINE" and another indicating the "Direction of Flight of Object," with a dotted line stating "Line of Initial Sight." Distance markers such as "1/2 mile" and "1/4 mile" are noted, as well as a specific point marked as "OBSERVERS." There are notations for what look like roads or paths, with labels such as "J.S.H.WY MAIN GATE TO ROBERTSON," and "9TH AVENUE." 

The handwritten text at the top reads "GROUND PLAN OF AREA AT NATRONA COUNTY AIRPORT (NOT TO SCALE)".

As for the act as an OCR system, here is the output of all the text found in the document:

The handwritten numbers and letters scattered around the edges are more difficult to read and don't provide coherent sentences but appear to be additional annotations related to the map.
