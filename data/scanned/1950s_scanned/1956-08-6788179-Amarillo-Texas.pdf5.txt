1. At 1330 hours, 5 August 1956, Mr. Dallas, Texas, telephone reported the following information to the OSI Detachment Office, Hensley Field, Grand Prairie, Texas, concerning the sighting of unconventional type aircraft:

He advised that on 1 August 1956 as he was returning to Dallas, Texas, from Colorado Springs, Colorado, via Amarillo, Texas, he had departed Amarillo at approximately 0500 hours on Route 187 287. He observed that approximately ten (10) miles outside of Amarillo, he noted a bright green trajectory in the sky at about 10 o'clock. Shortly after he had landed just east of Dallas, he observed another similar phenomenon which originated to the north of Highway 287. Shortly after, he advised that this light appeared in a cloud formation, estimating its altitude to be approximately 10,000 to 20,000 feet. Further, that this cloud formation was approximately 50 miles in length from north to south and a lesser distance in width running east to west. Never did the phenomenon appear to descend below the level of the cloud base and moved intermittently within the cloud formation and on various occasions would move outside the extreme ends of the cloud running north to south. No sound was audible at any time during either the trajectory or the movement of the object itself.
