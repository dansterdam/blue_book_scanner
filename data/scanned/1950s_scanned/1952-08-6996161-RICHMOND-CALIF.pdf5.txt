Dear Sir:
The object appeared to be frank, circular and with other characteristics which seem to have been seen by others. The speed is very slow as only about 15 percent of watchers have seen it. It appears as if less than rather slay above the place and seemed to be moving cautiously. See the haste motion of the watch, it disappeared much more to the south quickly. It seems little more to the south rather than to the hill. It will move to approach and now as if to become smaller but not smaller but no more appeared watch.
Please note the speed attitude and that such a change and not give mean the hanggulseem to become more.
I feel quite lonely at night. Walking is thorough hours in some perfectly sound, but standing in sight through binoculars is seems period rather than to the hill.
