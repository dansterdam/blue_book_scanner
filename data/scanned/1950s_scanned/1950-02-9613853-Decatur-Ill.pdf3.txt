"Good Thunder, Minnesota
June 13, 1955

Project-same", wingate-peterson field.
Ican't this - my husband asked me to report to you; - As we were returning home from visiting friends. On Monday P.M. between 2:30 P.M. and 3:00 P.M., on Highway U.S. 36, driving west from Rochester, we saw something to the left front of us â€” as of a silver flash. Like we sometimes see when the sun strikes a plane - but, as we watched, there were no plane in sight - just the silver flash.
We thought someone else might have seen it also and reported to you - would be interested in any information you could give me.

Yours truly -
Mrs. ***"
