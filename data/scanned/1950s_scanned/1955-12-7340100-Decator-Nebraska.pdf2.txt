Text transcribed from the handwritten content:
Six sightings January 7, approximately 8:30 PM. First sighting was a round light in northwestern sky. It moved in a peculiar manner about 2 minutes, then vanished. Second sighting was at 8:45 PM, southeast sky. Light resembling a star came into view, moved rapidly toward zenith, stopped, then dropped at a rapid rate of speed. At 8:47 PM, two objects came out of the southwest, flew overhead, and disappeared in the northeast. About 9:30 PM, two white lights appeared southeast, moved toward the southwest, stopped, hovered, then sped away. At 10:30 PM, two orange-red lights came up from the horizon, circled, and disappeared. At 10:40 PM, one white light appeared and hovered for 15 minutes. It then faded and disappeared. Whole evening activity lasted from about 8:30 to 10:45 PM.
