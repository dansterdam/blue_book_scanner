Enclosed is a questionnaire, which, when completed by you and returned to this office, will provide a comprehensive record of the data and will provide information to further evaluate this possibility by obtaining your estimates of azimuth and elevation angles on the object's position. 
Your interest in reporting the matter and your public spirited desire to be of service are greatly appreciated.
