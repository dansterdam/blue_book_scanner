Transcription of the text in the document:

"This may convince many on the point. I do not know how I can convince you - - -
I am now convinced that what I saw on the night of November 5, 1959 was an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) and not a conventional aircraft. It was a bright light, highly maneuverable, that hovered in the sky for several minutes, then suddenly shot up at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. I was driving along a lonely road at the time, and the object was not affected by clouds or atmospheric conditions. It clearly was not a star, planet, or any known type of conventional aircraft.

The object was totally silent, and seemed to be under intelligent control. It made abrupt changes in direction and speed that would be impossible for any known aircraft. I watched it for about ten minutes, and its performance was completely different from anything I have ever seen before. I am convinced that what I saw was a genuine UFO, and not just some misidentification of a conventional object.

I realize that this is a controversial subject, and many people are skeptical about the reality of UFOs. But I can assure you that my observations were accurate, and I have no reason to doubt what I saw with my own eyes. I hope that my account will add to the growing body of evidence that UFOs do indeed exist, and that they represent a phenomenon that deserves serious scientific study and investigation."
