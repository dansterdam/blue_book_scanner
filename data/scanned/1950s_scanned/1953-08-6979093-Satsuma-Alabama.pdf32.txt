Dear Captain Wallace W. Elwood

Received your letter of May 9, 1957 containing a news release dated December 29, 1952 concerning information on UFO's. I certainly was glad to receive it. All the time I have been studying these collated studies I spent gathering UFO information which pertains to sightings that would be of interest to you. I have a few questions and some of the continuing questions are just a few that I would like answered concerning what the Air Force considers on these sightings.

1. What was the object chased by Captain Thomas P. Mantell Jr. and his two wingmen Lt. A. W. Clements and Lt. B. L. Hammond over Kentucky on January 7, 1948 that ended in Capt. Mantell's death?

2. What was the Air Force's explanation of the "Montana Montana" sighting on August 15, 1950 by Pan American airways?

3. What was the Air Force's explanation of the "Tremonton Movie" taken on July 2, 1952 by Warrant Officer Delbert Newhouse?

4. What were the objects that flew over Washington D.C., during the months of July 1952?

5. What is the Air Force's explanation of the seven objects observed and photographed and the 51 passengers aboard their British Overseas Airways Constellation on June 29, 1954 near Goose Bay, Labrador?

6. Why did the objects vanish into the larger ship when approach made to investigate the strange escort?

7. What was the little object that zipped through the town streets of East Lyme Haven, Connecticut and pierced a steel billboard and vanished into the sky on August 15, 1952?

8. What are the "green fireballs" so often observed in the western portion of the United States?
