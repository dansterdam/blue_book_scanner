AIR FORCE FLIGHT ON 9 FEB 59

On 9 February 1959 near Pittston, Pennsylvania, the pilot of an American Airlines flight reported that he had sighted a strange object in the sky. This object was observed by the copilot and two flight engineers. The report states that the object was described as a "white light" which was approaching their aircraft from behind at a high rate of speed. The object then is said to have made a sudden change in direction and speed, disappearing from view.

The document discusses the sighting and the Air Force's response, which involved further investigation. It also mentions that there were several unanswered questions regarding the incident, and the Air Force requested additional information from the American Airlines pilot.
