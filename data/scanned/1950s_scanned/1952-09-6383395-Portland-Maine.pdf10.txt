**SECTIONAL CHARTS**
The sectional aeronautical chart series provides complete coverage of the United States. An additional chart covers the Hawaiian Islands. These charts are designed primarily for plotting, which is also known as contact flying. They contain a maximum amount of cultural topographic features including important landmarks.

Sectional charts are revised at six-month periods to insure that the airman has the latest information available, and are sold through authorized agents located at airports and principal cities throughout the United States. They may also be obtained by writing to the Director, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Department of Commerce Building, Washington 26, D. C.

In the lower right-hand corner is printed the date of the chart. Below this the next scheduled printing is indicated. If the date of the chart is more than six months old, users are advised to check with the notices (Dates of Latest Prints) on file with authorized agents. Charts that carry older dates than those shown in large type on this list of dates are obsolete.
