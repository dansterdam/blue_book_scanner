This PI Report has been written to fulfill a request submitted by Captain George Gregory
AFOIN HFIG concerning analysis of UFO Photography.
1. After detailed review of IR 2-58 and three attached photos. It is apparent that
discrepancies exist in the data presented.
The image measurements on the respective photos were as follows:
P-21142 Length (mm) 3.10 Width (mm) .85
P-21143 1.05 .11
P-21144 1.7 .11
These image dimensions when produced by 105mm lens dictates the angle is subtended
by the traces of the objects in space. They are as follows:
P-21142 Length (mm) 3.10 10' 41" x 26'
P-21143 1.05 00' x 34' = 20'
P-21144 1.7 00' 55" = 39'

2. Using the given speed of 31Oc or 5.94 m/s min and the limits of exposure times of
1 and 4 min the images shown could only have been produced by the item traveling at
the respective distances.
P-21142 (1 min) (4 min)
201 m 805 m
P-21143 595 m 2379 m
P-21144 839 m 3355 m
Some reexamining of the image would occur at the frame and lens axis that would
at an angle other than 90Â°, the extent is not determinable from the data given.
