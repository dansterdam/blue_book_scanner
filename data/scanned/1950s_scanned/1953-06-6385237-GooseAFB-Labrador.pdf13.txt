25 June 1953

Lt. Lt. Robert Olsson
AFOIC - Welch-Peterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olsson:

Of the last batch of 4 items sent on June 15, the only one about which I know here the duration of sighting. A lot depends on this. Can you get this information?

Regarding the Detroit 11 June case, there anything in this that a good landing seems to be proven. As you know, AFOIC has asked me to check on this. If this case is faulty radar, I assume that the CCF has proven it. I bill still envisioning this as a good case.

Regarding the 11 case in Venus with us. The 25 June Gorman case is clearly and unequivocally Venus.

Jimmie has called to my attention the fact that I asked some follow-up questions which by now you may have obtained the answers. Anything further from:
17 March False APR - Film?
23 March San Antonio
22 April Stead APB

I am anxiously awaiting Jimmie's clearance, so we can get organized in a more business-like manner. I know you can't do anything about this but, just mentioning it anyway. I hope it comes through soon before your successor is appointed.

Cordially,
Allen Hynek
