Oddly Behaving Meteor Flurry Puzzles Experts in Southwest

ALBUQUERQUE, N. M., Nov. 6 - (AP) - Residents of the southwestern states were mystified by what seemed like a meteor shower through the skies over a wide area last night.

Dr. Lincoln LaPaz, director of the University of New Mexico's Institute of Meteoritics, said the frequency has never been observed before on such a scale, although individual meteors are common.

He said the rate of meteors, which he estimated were traveling at 20 to 30 miles per second, was so high it would suggest the phenomenon is not an ordinary meteor shower.

The fireball, reported by observers in several southwestern states, did not conform to the irregular pattern of ordinary meteors at all. Dr. LaPaz said they moved in parallel lines and crashed one after the other like a series of tracer bullets, lighting up the southwest corner of the state.

At Washington, the Defense Department said the strange performance was not explainable at the moment and "further study" would be required.

A spokesman replied the department knew nothing of any tests or the like in the southwest at the time.

MIDDLETOWN, Ohio, Nov. 6 (AP) - Mrs. Roy C. Campbell, who saw the phenomenon at Woodsfield, Ohio, tonight, said the streaks "looked like long flashes from the sky, extending for miles and coming in a straight line."

"The phenomenon was observed again tonight," she said. "The flashes came in very rapidly, one after the other, and resembled powerful floodlights sweeping the sky from the southwest."
