3. Interview with Lt COLE:

He is a pilot with the 6148th Tactical Control Squadron, TAC, 5th Air Force. Pilots were flying their aircraft on a routine training mission over the MANCHURIAN BORDER, KOREA, on 7 July 1952. At approximately 1232 hours, two unidentified aircraft approached their flight of aircraft. These unidentified aircraft appeared to be flying at an estimated speed of 600-800 mph, and were observed for approximately 15 minutes. The pilots obtained a good visual observation of the unidentified aircraft and stated the following narrative record:

"I was the first pilot, and the other pilot was [REDACTED]. We were flying our aircraft in a routine training mission over the MANCHURIAN BORDER, KOREA, on 7 July 1952 at approximately 1232 hours, when two unidentified aircraft approached our flight. These unidentified aircraft appeared to be flying at an estimated speed of 600-800 mph, and were observed for approximately 15 minutes. The objects seemed to be metallic in appearance, and had a long, cylindrical shape, with no wings, tail, or protruding parts. The objects emitted no smoke, flame, or exhaust, and their flight path was a series of abrupt changes of direction, with no circling or maneuvering as would be characteristic of our aircraft. At the time of the sighting, the flight was at an altitude of 20,000 feet, and there was excellent visibility. Both pilots stated that the objects were unlike anything they had ever seen before, and that they could not identify the objects. It is difficult to judge the exact size of the objects, but they appeared to be in the range of sixty to eighty feet in length. The pilots did not obtain any photographs of the objects because the aircraft were not equipped with cameras that were ready for this type of mission. As the objects approached, my aircraft was at 20,000 feet, heading 040°, and the objects seemed to be on a collision course. Just prior to the closest point of approach, the objects made an abrupt 90° turn and continued on a south-southeast heading, maintaining their original high rate of speed. At the time of the sighting, ground radar was not operational in that area, so no positive radar tracking was obtained. The pilots stated that the objects seemed to ignore their presence, and maintained their original course and speed throughout the encounter."
