Gentlemen:

Please refer to my letter of January 25, 1950.

On January 25, 1950, I requested News Release No. 62-59 of January 22, this year, concerning the Air Force UFO Study. This is not, of course, an enquiry to which I requested specific information, repeated as follows for your conveniences:

"I would greatly appreciate the completion of the basic details concerning these two cases that were considered 'unknown.'"
Various papers in Indiana carried an extremely interesting UFO observation made in the early morning hours of October 3, 1959, by the crew man of freight train No. 1 - the Moon Railroad. They reported the sighting of a strange object as having crossed the tracks just ahead of the train. What was the conclusion for this case??"

I would appreciate having a definite answer to my questions.

Congress, including Senator Lyndon Johnson, whose attention has already been called to this matter.

Very truly yours,
