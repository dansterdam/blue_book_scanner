FILING REPORT: West Palm Beach, Fla.
DATE OF SIGHTING: 28 July 1952

I came in about 10:30 and they were standing in the patio watching the TV show. They said that to be some lights streaking in the sky. I went out to look and they were right, there were about 15 lights in the sky in a straight line, they would disappear one at a time and another would appear a little distance to the other side, they would do this for about 15 mins. The lights were round and white and about the size of a dime at arms length, they were not blinking just steady white lights. They seemed to be going about the speed of an airplane and were at about the same altitude. I have no idea what they could have been, I have never seen anything like it before. After watching for about 15 mins they all disappeared at once. One rather odd thing that I noticed was that a couple of my neighbors had also come out to watch, we stood there in silence watching in amazement. I called the sheriff's office after they disappeared but they said they had had several calls about them and there was nothing they could do. I would be very interested in knowing what these lights were that we saw. I have a very suspicious mind and I'm wondering if it could have been some kind of new aircraft the government is experimenting with, or could it have been something from outer space? I would appreciate any information you could give me on this.
