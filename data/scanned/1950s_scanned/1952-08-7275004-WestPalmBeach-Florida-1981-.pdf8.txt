West Palm Beach, Florida

Report on Unidentified Aerial Object

NARRATIVE:

On the evening of August 7, 1952, at approximately 8:00 PM, witnesses reported observing an unidentified aerial object over West Palm Beach, Florida. The object was described as being approximately 30 feet in diameter, circular in shape, and emitting a bright white light. The object was observed to hover and make sudden changes in direction before accelerating at a high rate of speed and disappearing from view.

This incident was reported to the United States Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, a program established to investigate reports of unidentified aerial phenomena. Photographs were taken of the object, and the incident was thoroughly investigated by Air Force personnel.

The investigation concluded that the observed object could not be definitively identified as any known aircraft or natural phenomenon. The case remains unresolved and is included in the official records of Project Blue Book.
