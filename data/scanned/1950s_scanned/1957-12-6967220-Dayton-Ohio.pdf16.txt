"1730 - Phone call received from a Mr ---------------- Dayton, Ohio (Tel CR 5-2293) on a UFO. I filled out questionnaire to best of my ability from information he related. Mr ----------------- stated that at approximately 1700 hrs, 22 Dec 57, he and his wife were looking out window and saw a large, bright light in the sky which appeared to change directions and move swiftly. As it moved closer, it seemed to split into several smaller objects, at which time he called the police. The police did not arrive in time to see the objects. Mr ----------------- stated the objects were of definite size and the motion was erratic, zigzagging, and at times appeared to be hovering. He felt the objects were unusual and probably a new type of aircraft, and he was interested in reporting the incident. I advised him that I would record the information and forward it to proper channels."
