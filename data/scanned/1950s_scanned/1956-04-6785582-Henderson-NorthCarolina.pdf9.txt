There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a letter dated July 19, 1956 from J. Allen Hynek of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to a Miss _____ Avenue in Alexandria, Virginia.

The text of the letter is as follows:

July 19, 1956

Miss _____ Avenue 
Alexandria, Virginia

Dear Miss _____,

Captain Gregory, of the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, has asked me to call with you regarding an unidentified flying object made on April 10, 1954. This matter came to our attention through a letter from the office of J. Edgar Hoover directed to the Air Force. We have long been a matter of interest and discussion, and I shall be in Washington from July 21 to July 24.

I shall attempt to phone you sometime over the weekend but it will be difficult to make connections. I wonder whether you will be able to make some convenient for me in care of Mr. _____ Avenue. I cannot give his phone number at hand but it is listed in the phone book.

I would like very much to have more details on your sighting and, of course, to attempt an identification. We like to keep our unknowns at as low a level as possible.

Sincerely yours,

J. Allen Hynek
Astronomer
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
