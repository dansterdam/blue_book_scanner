The cross-hatched area of the figure represents the limits of the characteristics of an object which could produce the tracks observed at Benton; however, two major discrepancies must be noted concerning the above target size and altitude data:
a. No known type of airborne object should produce a 1.0 blip-scan ratio during the entire length of the track from its initial detection to its abrupt disappearance.
b. Based on the above target size and altitude estimates, the HCR indicates that the observed tracks were also within the detection capability of the VF and search kit beams; therefore, the tracks should have been detected in these beams.
4. Missile Characteristics:
a. Possibility of Cruise Type Missile: Tracking subsequent to the first pickup indicated a speed of approximately 5,400 knots or Mach 8.
Considering the so-called heat or thermal barrier problem this would be an extension of the state of the art so far beyond present day accomplishments as to be considered impossible for some time to come. In order to escape the heat barrier an airplane flying at this speed would have to fly above 300,000 feet. This again is so far beyond present day accomplishment as to be considered extremely unlikely. On the other hand, if we consider only the second pickup (by Benton), the ground speed of that portion (approximately 1,000 knots) would be consistent with the present state of the art.
b. Possibility of Ballistic Missile: A horizontal speed of Mach 9 is consistent with a 5,000 n.m. range ballistic missile. The 1,000 knot portion of the track is also consistent with ballistic missile re-entry.
