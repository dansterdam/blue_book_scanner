This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document or report, likely part of Project Blue Book, an Air Force program that investigated UFO sightings in the United States in the mid-20th century.

Transcribing the text:

1. To be considered as 'cause OF' 
2. Partly confirmed as one of those seen on.

I believe the bright appearing object were not free targets, but were probably an observation aircraft.
From the description of the object as moving rapidly and erratically, it would appear that the indications were of the type which results from such propagation peculiarities.

This document explains the sighting and suggests that the "lights" observed were likely an observation aircraft, rather than an unidentified flying object. The report discusses the characteristics of the object's movement and appearance, and concludes that it was likely caused by propagation effects rather than an extraterrestrial phenomenon.

The text also mentions that the pursuing aircraft never saw the object, or had radio contact with it, which could indicate that there was no material object present.
