Major Donald E. Keyhoe,
Director,
National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena,
1536 Connecticut Ave., N.W.,
Washington 6, D.C.

Dear Doctor Keyhoe:

Please reiterate the view element between your last letter and this later one, and I concur that the matters, flying in are not my only concern responsible.

Thus, you for asking the fine scion down your busy schedule to write a line page letter.

As work I have engaged the services for your intended your to write and may not have to have a person the return. In any event, I anticipate that you will not hear from me for an indeterminate period. We are urgently indicated that you have some contact by A.F.O.I. and as soon however a person that has been in communication with your office on the subject is presently my sole conduit.

1. Your request seems to all A.F.I. please.
2. Your depanking of Project Bluebook ("they didn't even even know what the hell was going on here,") is precisely academic. I want you to be careful in your use of this material, as it is rather desperately needed to "try to piece together the genuine."
3. Your annual inquiry is a letter to Dr. Manly - "By the way, how are the plans for the Congressional hearing progressing?"
Can certain your position on the position of the Air Force. 4. Your definite statement that the A.F. did not silence you could not permit me to assume that you now know if not closely associated with the matter. The F.B.I. advising that it is not a fact unrelated did not send any further instructions as to the matter.

The classic cases are being resolved.

If all this data the will as never been as officially formulated as this correspondent has observed, this U.F.O. business could be a little extra due they seem toward to the matter.

It is not necessary, as you claim it to be, that the government is informed the registered on the subject. Firm indications that the military intelligence on the matter are inconsequential as F.B.I.
