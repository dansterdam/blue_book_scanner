Dear Sirs:
Following the instruction of Lt. Weber, with whom I talked on the telephone this morning, I am sending you sketches of the unknown object that appeared in the sky almost over our home in Dayton View at 5-05 this morning.

Since the Lt. has all the details I need not go into the whole description of the appearance of the object except to emphasize:

1. The beams of light which awakened me were not a white light (as I believe the Lt. thought I said) The light was bright and shimmering and to be thought of more as reddish than white.

The object appeared to be about the size of a soft ball (baseball) which has a circumference of about twelve inches. For by the time I reached the window and could view the object there was no longer light beaming from it and I could see the shape. Trusting that this description may be of some use in detecting the phenomena should it again appear, I remain

In the interest of Civil Defense.
