UFO Sighting by Capt. [redacted]

ATCIN-12L. ATTN: Capt. [redacted] 11 March 1959

ATCIN-4R

ATCIN-121/133] Friend/cc/69236/B-36 123

1. Analysis of subject sighting and report of Capt. [redacted]'s report is attached.

2. Upon receiving an unofficial report of Capt. [redacted]'s sighting, the Air Defense Command in Detroit was contacted. The Captain had not made a written report, and upon request of this Center, the Detroit office agreed to have the Captain submit a written report.

3. In the meantime, another report of two United Airlines pilots sighting of unidentified objects in the vicinity of Niagara Falls area was received. Both pilots have made an observation of the lights. The 327th Air Base Group at Niagara Falls also reported observing similar lights. However, a check was made with the 7732nd Air Base Wing, and it was determined that no navigational traffic was reflecting operations.

4. Certain descriptive data and that of the two United Airlines pilots coincide. It would appear that the same object was possibly observed by different individuals and the lights were probably caused by the same source. A check was made with the aircraft support systems project office, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, to determine the characteristics of a night reflecting phenomena.
