20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object you saw. Of what type material would you want it to be made, and what shape would it be, and what other shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

It is difficult to imagine what kind of actual object would match the appearance you described, as the reported details are rather vague and do not provide a clear picture. Without more specifics about the object's size, shape, motion, and disappearance, it is challenging to identify a common earthly object that could resemble it in the sky. The report leaves much room for interpretation.
