The image does not contain a photograph or image. It appears to be a page of text from a UFO report document.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output the text found in the document:

"The explanation was quite simple. The hot day had warmed the air above, but the coolingof the surface at the onset of darkness had caused a layer of warm air to overly a layer of cooled air. This inversion had produced an optical effect that formed a moving, ever-changing image of a bright tavern sign more than fifty miles away, a real mirage. There were few cars on the road, but as we met them the effect was most startling because some of them were so enlarged by the lens effect that a car five miles away seemed to be rushing directly at us only a block or two ahead. Sometimes these cars would appear to come to a sharp stop, reverse their course and disappear in the distance. At other times they would appear to be rushing on us upside down, with part of the road itself in the sky. Altogether it was a weird experience, but not in any sense supernatural. Lenses of air, either close to the ground or in the sky, can produce strange illusions.

In this case, as in many UFO puzzles, the solution depended on a knowledge of the weather conditions and of the laws of local geography. If the pursuing car had turned off the road or stopped, the specific cause of the phenomenon might still be a mystery."
