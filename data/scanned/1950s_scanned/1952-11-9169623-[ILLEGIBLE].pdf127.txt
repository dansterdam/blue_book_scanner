Major Lawrence J. Tacher, USAF
Public Information Division 
Office of Information 
Department of the Air Force
Washington 25, D. C.

Dear Major Tacher:

Thank you for your letters dated October 6, 1959 and October 14, 1959. I would like to comment on the details of the Salton Sea, Calif. UFO report of November 26, 1957 which I had discussed with you as they seem to contain certain discrepancies.

Thank you for the press release No. 705-59.

Are your October 14 letters meant to be copies of the latest APRO bulletin. If so, I would like to know if you could provide me with an additional copy of the latest APRO bulletin. With the revision of any APRO, I APRO 220-2, there are two other APRI's mentioned: they are APRO 220-1 and APRO 505-1. If these documents are not classified, may I have copies of them?

Would you know of any way at all that I could at least borrow a copy of APRO 148 for a few days? As it is "out of print" I realize the problem involved, but I am badly in need of the information contained in the defense of USAF officers that could be loaned to me for a few days if some can be parted with, with the understanding that UNO research will be in the strictest confidence.

Is the statement that each UFO investigation costs the USAF $10,000.00 correct? It was attributed to an unnamed USAF spokesman during the UFO "flap" of November 1, 1957.

Also during November, 1957, a Colonel Dean Hess, USAF, apparently an associate or public made a public demand that the "AG" occasionally investigate UFOs, instead of brushing them off, as it had done in the past. This was reported by the Associated Press. What AF later did in regard to this situation, and was any progress made for this statement? If not, on what grounds was he reprimanded, if he was reprimanded.

Yours for sincere research,
