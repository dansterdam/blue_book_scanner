2 aircraft pilots of the 57th Fighter Squadron, 58th Fighter Interceptor Wing, ALAS, saw a peculiar object over the Arctic Circle 40 miles south-southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska.

b. Two observers in a C-47 aircraft (25296) while flying from Anchorage to Fairbanks, Alaska (Etar 45-08) they saw what they believe to be "flying discs" about 30 miles south of Kenai, Alaska (Etar 45-08), at 1600 hours, 11 September 1950.

c. An Air Intelligence Officer at Elmendorf AFB stated that it was reported that a rumor circulated that a "flying disc" landed near Clear, Alaska, on 14 September 1950. Upon checking this report, the rumor was not verified and the matter was classified as "unconfirmed."

d. The following is a summary of the sightings mentioned above:
1) The first sighting by the two pilots of the 57th Fighter Squadron, 58th Fighter Interceptor Wing, ALAS, was at 1730 hours on 13 September 1950, 40 miles south-southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. The objects were described as round, appeared to be metallic, and made abrupt changes in course and altitude. They were observed for about 10 minutes.
2) The second sighting by the crew of the C-47 aircraft (25296) was at 1600 hours on 11 September 1950, about 30 miles south of Kenai, Alaska. The observers described the objects as "flying discs" and they were observed for about 5 minutes.
3) The unconfirmed report of a "flying disc" landing near Clear, Alaska, on 14 September 1950, could not be verified.

In all cases, the Air Intelligence Officers concerned by that time had investigated the reports and had determined that there was no concrete evidence to indicate the presence of any unconventional aircraft in the area. The reports were therefore classified as "unidentified."
