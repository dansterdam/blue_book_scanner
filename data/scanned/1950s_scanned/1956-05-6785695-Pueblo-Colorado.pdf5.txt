AIR FORCE INVESTIGATES STRANGE LIGHTS
On May 15th, Pueblo, Colorado - strange lights in the sky near Pueblo were reported by various individuals for six successive nights. The first report was received Thursday by the Air Force. The report stated that on four successive nights, objects for an unspecified length of time near Pueblo were reported Thursday to the Air Force. The first report was made to Peterson Field here by the Pueblo GOC. Capt. Vincent Flaster, a member of the Air Force's Air Defense Filter Center, said he knows of no attempt to investigate the sightings on the intervening nights. Other reports also came to the Air Force Base at Pueblo to investigate. He reported he observed six apparitions of the objects between 9 p.m. and midnight, but one was more distinctive than the others. He said it 'faint but bright enough to see' and 'singular in shape,' but one was found and brighter than the others. Most of them were 'diamond-shaped' and from five or six seconds at a time, so great was their speed. The Air Force said it sent another team to Pueblo on Tuesday, but gave no report of its findings.
