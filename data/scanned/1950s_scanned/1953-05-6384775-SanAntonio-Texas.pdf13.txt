McDonald Observatory
22 June 1953

1st Lt. Robert Olason
ATIC - Wright-Patterson AFB

Dear Lt. Olason,

Here are the comments on the recent batch of material. A few cases are certainly of considerable interest. Over 20 April in Ticonderoga Venus counts for 6 cases; balloons for 4 more counts for 3 cases; Stuttgart - Fireballs most probably account for 4 cases.

Coming to the interesting cases: the Korean 20 April should certainly be followed up. This seems very close to being a satellite. The intelligence matter is quite interesting. How about sending a few Form A to officers occasionally wish information on this? How about trying to spot by intelligence officers?

Pepperhill AFB 2 May: This has some similarities to the old German cases. Much similar material needed and Form A should be sent if this has not already been done.

San Antonio 7 May: This has many similarities to the Lubbock Lights and Form A should certainly be sent if this has not already been done. 

Finally, a Form A for the 29 April Syracuse stationary-disc sighting. The lighting might have been jet, but the green light sighting, etc. should have been investigated more.

I hope that you can eventually send me more information on these: 20 April; 2 May; Pepperhill; 7 May San Antonio.

I am enclosing my version of a report on our recent trip with which I hope you will concur. And keep 'em coming. It's easier to handle a few at a time and frequently than a larger batch at longer intervals. Jennie send her regards.
