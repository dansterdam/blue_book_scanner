The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet with handwritten text describing an observation of an unidentified flying object.

The text reads:

1. Sightings are not reported in local news papers, although there are several sightings frequenty in New York. This object would not have been noticed under normal conditions.

2. Several witnesses at the sight of the right observer. This happened on officer who had received the duty of observing the sky. He described them as oval shaped and elongated like a cigar. They were maneuvering in the sky. 

3. The witnesses were possibly 25 people or more in the same block with some, how ever the object caused considerable effect.

4. They were an elongated cylindrical shape - that the object didn't which an off.

My brief impressions were a sighting - similar to those seen in propulsion in the poll - and occasionally at other times of the year. Of these I have seen many.
