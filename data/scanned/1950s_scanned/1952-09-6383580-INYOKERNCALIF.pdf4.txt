Col. Harrington: And it was at night, between 10 and 10:30 p.m.

Col. Harrington: Was it moving fast?

Mr. [Redacted]: No. It was going to the northeast because I sighted it by the stars, and it kept parallel all the time, and then it went down with just a flame following. Not a large flame, but just a small flame.

Col. Harrington: Approximately where would you say it came down?

Mr. [Redacted]: To here. It came down in the valley, the last time I looked at it. It seemed to be going down with just a little less speed and then went out completely.

Col. Harrington: Apparently going to the northeast.

Mr. [Redacted]: Yes.
