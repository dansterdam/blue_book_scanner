AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Det 1, 6004th ATIS, APO 970
On 16 and 17 October 1952, 1st Lt William H. Cooper and 1st Lt Tho mas A. Lemon, Jr., of the 6004th ATIS, were interviewed with regard to the sighting of an unidentified object. 
On 16 October 1952 at 11:45 PM, a USAF C-47 aircraft carrying certain air material personnel was at an altitude of 9,500 ft, over terrain approximately 50 miles west of Taegu, Korea, when the pilot observed a bright light of considerable size approaching the aircraft from the rear. The light kept closing on the aircraft, and the pilot took evasive action by diving the aircraft to an indicated altitude of 8,000 ft. At this point, the light was closing in on the aircraft, and the pilot fired two bursts from his machine guns at the object. The object appeared to be reflecting the tracer bullets, and the pilot observed that it was about the size of a basketball at arm's length. The object then appeared to move off to the side of the aircraft and the pilot was able to regain the altitude he had lost. The pilot estimated the speed of the object to be approximately 600 mph.
The nearest observation was made at a distance of 3 to 4 miles.
