Dear Captain Gregory:

Enclosed is a report regarding a visual sighting of an unidentified flying object which occurred on October 14, 1956, in the vicinity of Fort Thomas, Kentucky. The observer is an employee of the local General Electric Co. plant and is a reliable person. He is an ex-member of the U.S. Air Force, a qualified and licensed private pilot, and in the present instance, observed the object while driving in traffic.

He stated that as he approached a bridge, he noticed a bright, round, stationary object hovering approximately 50 feet above the bridge, and approximately 1,000 feet from his position. He pulled off the road and stopped his car in order to observe the object more closely. The object remained stationary for approximately 10 minutes and then accelerated at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The observer described the object as round, brilliantly luminous, and about 30-40 feet in diameter. He stated that the object appeared to reflect light, rather than emanate light, and that it was soundless.

The observer did not attempt to photograph the object as he stated that he was so excited and surprised by the experience that he was unable to react quickly enough to get his camera. I have advised him to be alert for any future sightings and to be prepared to obtain photographs.

If you have any additional information regarding these photographic attempts, or can advise us of any special instructions which you may have for the observer, we would appreciate your comments.

Very truly yours,
