The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the instructions to "Place an 'A' on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a 'B' on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it."

The second and third sketches show larger drawings depicting different views of an outdoor scene. The second sketch shows a road with buildings and trees on either side, while the third sketch shows a more distant, mountainous landscape.
