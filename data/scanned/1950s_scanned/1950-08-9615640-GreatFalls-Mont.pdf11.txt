Dear General Watson:

Enclosed is a report of an analysis of the "Montana" film of Unidentified Flying Objects prepared by the Douglas Aircraft Company's Missile Engineering Department Research Section. This report was prepared by the Douglas Aircraft Company's Missiles Engineering Department Research Section on the basis of publications dealing with unconventional propulsion schemes, under the direction of Dr. Vid E. Nillson, Jr. It is being submitted for your project Blue Book as a supplement to such information as has already been compiled.

The film and necessary information for this analysis were furnished to us by the Green-Rouse Studios who will soon release a documentary film on UFO's.

Green-Rouse Studios have requested that copies of the present report be made available to them by April 25, 1956. If you concur, this we shall be pleased to do. We are quite willing, in view of their full cooperation, that they have the desired copies. It would be greatly appreciated if your approval or disapproval of this release be sent to us prior to April 22, if necessary by telephone or by telegraph.

Sincerely,
A.R. Buchheister
