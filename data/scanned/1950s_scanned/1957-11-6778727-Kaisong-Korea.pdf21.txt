The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, a former U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document contains a description of an observed object, but there is no visible photograph within the image.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now proceed to extract and output the text found in the document:

STORRINAN'I'. Thomas F. -- PFQI', USN 277985
Was working in the Company Motor Pool at 0530 - 0600 hrs. when he saw a cigar-shaped object traversing the sky from the South to the Northeast at a high rate of speed. It was an estimated 500-1000 feet in altitude and was a blue-white color and luminous. The object was approximately 50 feet long and 10-15 feet wide. It appeared to be maneuvering and suddenly stopped, hovering silently for about 5 minutes. One end of the object was brighter than the other. After hovering, the object took off at a high rate of speed in the direction of the Northeast and disappeared from sight.
