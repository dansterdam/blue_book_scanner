WHAT CONTACT?

In the swashbuckling days of 1918 
In the days of World War One in France 
When men were “aviators”—always 
“Flew by the seat of their pants”

Two pet words in that day 
were—“CONTACT,” “COUPE.”

The modern fly-boys are more 
business and shekel-minded; 
Their helmeted brow never streamed a mademoiselle’s silk hose!

They concentrate more on E.T.A.
and delicately balanced wind sock;
Prosaically they say,
“Switch On—Switch Off.”

The early birds were pioneers all,
The modern boys, although jet headed,
May yet know, electronic control.

So to you, fast flyers 
and slow boaters;
And intermediate hikers;
To ALL of you dear souls;
Whether we have flown—
High in the air;
Whether we have flown—
Low in the water;
Trudged deep in the desert sands;
My appreciation,
And heartfelt thanks;
For having made CONTACT—
Along life’s way;
I love you,
Beyond the day of COUPE!
