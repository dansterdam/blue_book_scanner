Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp.
The Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, Bethpage, New York.
November 6, 1953.

Dear Sir:

Within the past several days we have received numerous requests for information relating to a report, supposedly given by a Grumman Aircraft Corporation employee, concerning observations of a strange aerial object. Please note that this report was not given by any employee of our company, and we have no information which would substantiate the claims made in this report. 

My first reaction to the report was of course one of embarrassment, as I am well acquainted with the high caliber of our personnel, both technical and administrative. If the report in question had indeed been given by one of our employees, it would have been in complete contradiction to our well-established policy of refusing to discuss or speculate upon unidentified flying objects.

November 30, 1953, the date of origin of this report, I was not in Bethpage, Connecticut, and to the best of my knowledge none of our personnel were either. We have a little information which I could give in, but had not and do not claim any personal observations of the locations of where this was seen.

As you may appreciate, these types of reports create considerable difficulty for us, and I trust that your office will not feel it necessary to make further inquiries of our personnel in this regard. Please be assured that we shall continue to cooperate fully in any official investigation of this or any related matter that may be conducted by your agency.

Respectfully,
[Signature]
