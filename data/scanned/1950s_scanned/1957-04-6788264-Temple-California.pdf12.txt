Army Digging for Mystery Missile Here

SAN GABRIEL, April 10 - Army bomb disposal experts today checked the backyard of a San Gabriel residence searching for what they believe may be a dangerous explosive missile.

But treasure not military are not sure just what the object is, and Captain R. B. Jackson said tests will be made to determine if it could be anything. All they have is handed with a clued at 8:25 a.m. Tuesday morning.

In made a crater-shaped hole in the ground, 24 inches in diameter. Experts said the object did not explode. But it could not be identified.

The hole was found by Oscar Murphy, that 17-year-old son. Pals says he heard the thump when it struck.

Murphy's father, Richard L. Murphy, called the Temple City sheriff's station to investigate. After deputies investigated, they decided it was out of their jurisdiction and called the Explosive Ordnance Disposal squad at Fort MacArthur.

Captain R. B. Jackson said the object was not made by the subject unit. It was a natural formation to those made to brace the object with steel supports.

Since no one can identify the mysterious object, it was transported from a local airplane to the 4602nd Air Force base wing at Norton Air Force Base, March Air Force Base, said Capt. Jackson. Meanwhile, Air Force sources emphatically denied any missile or its parts are missing from any military installation.
