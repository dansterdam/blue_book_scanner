The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a page from an old UFO report document. The page contains various questions and instructions related to describing an observed object or objects.

20. Draw a picture that will show the variation that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. If POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its largest dimension. (Size, not angle possible)
22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length?
23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Behind the low ridge between Crocker and Saddleback, the ridge being lower than Spotted Mountain north of it.
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you control the object the you saw. Of what type, shape, color and other physical characteristics would you make it? What large or small, and what sort of lighting or other characteristics as to speed, direction, and same appearances as the object which you saw.

The text indicates that the object or objects being described were as large as, or larger than, Jupiter, and that they disappeared behind a low ridge between Crocker and Saddleback mountains.
