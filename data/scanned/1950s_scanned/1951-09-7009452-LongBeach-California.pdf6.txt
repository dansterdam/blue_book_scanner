UNCLASSIFIED

23 September 1951 - 0230 PST, an unidentified object was sighted over Long Beach, California. Four US aircraft were scrambled and the object was described as being similar to a balloon with four lights. The object was at an altitude of 23,000 feet and moved in a straight line for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing. Weather conditions at the time were such that the object's movement could be easily observed.

Balloons were released from San Diego, Long Beach and Santa Maria, California at approximately 2220 PST. All of these stations reported that their balloons were released and weather station personnel stated that it would be very doubtful if their balloons could have been mistaken for the object observed.

All of the major aircraft factories and installations containing experiments on flights of experimental aircraft stated that no experimental aircraft were in the air at the time of the incident.

Additional information has been requested as to additional details of the incident, such as times and locations during the attempted interception by the F-86A and other possible balloon launchings.
