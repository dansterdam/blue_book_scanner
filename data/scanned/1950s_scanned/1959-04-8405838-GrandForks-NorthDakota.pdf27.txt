Transcribing the text from the document:

We wanted to see what was on this first place. We landed at this place, and walking about the top of this place we noticed something coming in for a landing. It was about 3 feet across and was round and flat like a saucer. The undersides were a reddish color. It skidded to a stop about 50 feet away. This didn't you don't believe, and it doesn't care but it's the truth. We walked up to the thing and it was some animal like we'd never seen before. It was hurt and as it breathed it's body would rise and fall making a half foot hole all around it like a clam opening and closing. Quite a stink had been created out of one side and there was a sort of metal looking from aside. When it saw us, it breathed out only a few inches, only to pull back to earth as gain. It was noise and glanced on the top side. We could see no eyes or legs. After a 20 minute stay, if started pulsating once more, slowly rose to a height of 10 feet away. And so help me, that thing grew as bright as all get out.
