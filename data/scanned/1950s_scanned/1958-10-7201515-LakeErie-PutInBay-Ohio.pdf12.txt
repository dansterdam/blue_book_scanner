Dear Sir:

This morning at about 15 minutes to 7 my father and at least ten other men saw a large light about the size of a basketball held at some length over the lake about due north of Middle Bass, Ohio. It remained about the brightness of an electric light bulb or a gasoline lantern. It appeared and disappeared twice, each time growing dim until it no longer could be seen, and reappearing in the same manner. All the men got the light appeared to be motionless.

These sightings are all consistent. The men were in their separate boats, two laying about a mile apart and the third about two and one half miles southwest of the other two.

After the light faded away no object could be seen where the light had been.
