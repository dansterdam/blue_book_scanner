Text from the document:

THE CAMERA 351
WAS CRASHED OUT OF CONTROL BY GLARE OUT OVER SOUTHERN STATIONARY, PROBABLY DRIVEN BY AN APPARANT PICKUP OF RADIOACTIVITY. BOTH PILOTS AND CREW FELT STRONGLY THAT SOMETHING VERY STRANGE HAD HAPPENED, FIRST TO THE CAMERAS AND THEN TO THE ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT AND AVIONICS, AS A DIRECT RESULT OF SOME KIND OF RADIATION OR ENERGY FIELD THEY HAD ENCOUNTER 
ED. SOUTH ALOFT FOR IRAN, THEY REPEATEDLY STATED THAT BOTH THEIR HAIR AND SKIN FELT AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN STRONGLY CHARGED WITH STATIC ELECTRICITY.
