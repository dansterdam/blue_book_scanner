Maters:
I understand you are the center where data on flying saucers is now being compiled.
On April 8, 1030, about 8:50 p.m. I was standing in my yard in Salineville, Ohio, when I observed an object in the sky moving in a very strange and erratic manner. The object appeared to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length. It was very bright silver in color, and seemed to be tumbling or rotating as it moved. It changed direction very abruptly several times, at one point making a very sharp turn. It moved at a rapid speed, disappearing from sight in a few seconds. The sky was clear, and I had a perfect view of the object. I am a veteran in my 50s, and this is the first time I have seen anything like this. While I understand your center is interested in this type of report, I hesitate to make any positive identification of what I saw. I merely want to report my observation in the event it may be of interest or value. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Sincerely yours,

NOTE: This witness certainly was impressed. He said that "they had had one other call...like mine, some time ago" for which they are now following up. Apparently, they have been receiving quite a few calls like this from apparently reliable observers, and are taking action to follow them up, so this one will undoubtedly be added to their files.
