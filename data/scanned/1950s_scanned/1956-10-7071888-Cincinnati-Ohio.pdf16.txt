The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program for investigating Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

Mr. and Mrs. ^ , an employee in the advertising department at Batavia, Ohio. Having first learned of sighting from Mrs. ^ , she was manager. I asked for more detailed information.
Mrs. ^ responded by writing up the following details: "On Sunday, Oct. 14, 1956 at about 6:30 pm, while traveling east on U.S. Highway 52, between Ripley and New Richmond, Ohio, I saw a reddish orange object in the sky. At first I thought it was an airplane, then I realized it was hovering or staying in one position. It seemed to be about 1,000 ft. above the ground and, in a northerly direction for at least a minute then it turned straight up and disappeared out of sight."

OBJECT RED
STARTING HERE LF WAS OFTEN SEEN, AND
THE WHOLE THING SEEMED TO TURN AT ONE TIME.

When the object turned it did not make an arc but made a sharp turn like this ^. 

The whole thing seemed to turn at one time. A jet would have had a curve to its turn but this did not. My wife and I with me at the time. She was driving so I did not take my eyes off it until it was out of sight. They all saw it.

Mr. ^ (and wife) ^ sighted in Northfield Hts, Ky at about 1:30 am. Mr. ^ described the object as large, about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. It was gun metal gray without apparent wings or tail or other appendages. He said the object appeared to be stationary for about a minute, and was quite low.

Thus, in brief, are the descriptions of the UFO's seen by three separate groups on October 14, plus the photographs. I hope they may prove to be of value to you and your command.

P.S.: Please return the enclosed photographs and negatives to the writer after analysis as I left them in my responsibility.
