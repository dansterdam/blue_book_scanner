DATE: SEPT 23 1957

The only way I can establish this is that I saw what appeared to be a large brilliant object or unknown origin flying over the Cincinnati area with a very pronounced glow trailing behind it. This happened at approximately 10:15 P.M. EST on the night of September 23, 1957. The object was observed by me and at least one other person from the Cincinnati area. It was traveling in an easterly direction at a very high rate of speed, and was estimated to be at an altitude of 3,000 to 5,000 feet. The object seemed to emit a tremendous amount of heat and heat waves were observed trailing behind it as it moved. I watched the object for nearly a minute before it disappeared from sight to the east. I tried to estimate its size to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter.
