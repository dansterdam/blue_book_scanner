There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a series of questions and handwritten responses.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place on "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. FEET.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length? (Circle One): c. Half dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22): a. Certain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Disappeared behind other objects out of sight.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make this large object that you saw, and what shapes would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

I see a large disc-shaped object that flew rapidly across the sky and disappeared behind other objects, obstructing my view. The object appeared to be metallic and very bright, reflecting sunlight. It moved with great speed and in a smooth, controlled manner. I cannot say with certainty what the exact size of the object was, but based on its comparison to a half dollar held at arm's length, I estimate it to be quite large, perhaps the size of a small airplane. Although I did not see the object land or change direction, I have a clear mental image of what I saw in the sky that day.
