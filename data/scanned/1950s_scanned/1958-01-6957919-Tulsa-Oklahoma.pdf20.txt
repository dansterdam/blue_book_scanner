The image does not contain any photographs, but rather appears to be a typed letter from the Project Blue Book investigation. The letter discusses an object believed to be a nose cone from the Jupiter Missile, and requests that X-ray analysis and wire gauge measurements be performed on the object to determine its internal content and gauge.

TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

DATE: 7 APR 58

MIX TO PROJECT WHITE STORKS
ATTN: HOWARD CROSS

Reference our conversation of last week regarding what is thought to be a nose cone from the Jupiter Missile. We wish to send this object to HQ via staff car on 8 April 1958. Request that you accomplish the following examinations:

1. X-Ray to determine internal content.
2. Determination of the wire gauge to see if this conforms with standard U. S. gauge for copper wire.

If thought feasible by your office, a spectrographic analysis of the wire to ascertain whether it matches U. S. specifications.

It is requested that these examinations be expedited; that the object be returned by staff car the same date, and that the results of the examinations by X-Ray and wire analysis be forwarded to the Center by 10 April 1958. Please advise by TWX this date if this can be done.
