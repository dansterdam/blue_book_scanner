Transcribed text from the document:

Great Falls, Montana

I was returning with my family from a fishing trip in Idaho. We had just heard a news broadcast on the radio that a "flying saucer" had been sighted over Great Falls, Montana, at about 10:50 PM on July 29.

As I was driving along the highway, I suddenly noticed three brightly lit objects in the western sky. I called the attention of my family to them. We watched them for about 15 minutes. They appeared to be circular in shape and about the size of a dinner plate held at arm's length. They were traveling in a diagonal line from northwest to southeast at a terrific speed and darted back and forth in an erratic manner. As they traveled, they would suddenly appear to dart or zig-zag at a tremendous rate of speed, then slow down, hover, and dart off again in a different direction. They were so bright that they illuminated the countryside below them. The objects would disappear and reappear at different places in the sky. At one time they seemed to merge into one large object, then separate again into three smaller objects.

I stopped the car and we all got out to watch them better. The three objects continued their maneuvers for about 15 minutes, then suddenly the three objects left the sky at a terrific speed and disappeared from sight.

After this incident, I wish to add that I am a "Major in the Air Force, A-2 Clearance 1945 to 1946" while stationed with X Division, Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico.
