I received a telephone call approx. 10:15 p.m. Thur. Sept 22. from Mr. Joe █████████ that there was a flying saucer in the sky - in the S.E. direction, from their house, asking me to report it to the C.O. at Cannon Fllr Center. I made the call, giving my station (Hotel Metro 50, Black) telling them of the object as I could see it with the naked eye - saw it high in the () S.E. sky - it went to S.W. @ ███ — at that point indicated with x there was something expelled from the object - there was explosion sound like fire crackers - (faint) - the object moved slowly - it just seemed to disappear all at once, there were two explosions or rocket flashes.
