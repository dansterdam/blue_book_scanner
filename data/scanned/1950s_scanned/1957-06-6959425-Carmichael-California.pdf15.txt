UNCLASSIFIED
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Date: 3 JUNE 1957
SOURCE: Address: Carmichael, California
Age: 27
Occupation: Housewife
Education: High School
Reliability: NONE
II. DETAILS: Mrs. M. described the SOURCE as fairly intelligent, not particularly outstanding, and not possessing any outstanding mental or physical capability. However, her interest is quite real and apparently stems from a religious conviction.
III. SOURCE initially observed the UFO in her home at approximately 2407000Z Jun 27. She noticed the object appear to her side, about 75 feet away and 40 feet above the ground. The object was yellowish and cigar-shaped, estimated to be 30 to 40 feet long and 20 to 25 feet in diameter. It was moving slowly, turning slightly as it traveled. SOURCE observed it for approximately one minute, heading gradually towards a northerly direction. As it passed overhead, SOURCE saw three yellow lights on the underside of the object, which gradually became dimmer and then disappeared. SOURCE believes she saw vapor trails or some sort of exhaust from the rear of the object during its flight.
IV. PHYSICAL SIGHTINGS: None.
