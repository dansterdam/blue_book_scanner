The photograph depicts a grainy black-and-white image, apparently from the "MARIANNA FILM," as labeled. It shows a structural tower with multiple cross beams, a small building at the base right of the tower, and a largely blank sky with a few markups. Two dark circular marks, possibly indicating objects of interest, are pointed at by arrows in the sky section.
