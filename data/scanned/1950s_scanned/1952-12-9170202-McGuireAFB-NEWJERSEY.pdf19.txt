CERTIFICATE

I, 0923P RANDALL, WILLIAM J. AF3769374, do certify that:
After the saucer-type object reported in the air, as reported, illumination and two flashes of light were observed. The object seemed to be of a bright, phosphorescent color. The observer estimated the object's size to be about 30 feet in diameter, and its elevation to be about 400 feet. The sighting lasted for approximately 10 to 15 seconds.
The object came directly toward the observer, moving erratically at a high rate of speed, and the sky was clear; however, no object forward of the flash was visible.
