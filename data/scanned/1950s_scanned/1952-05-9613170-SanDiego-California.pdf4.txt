The image appears to contain a handwritten sketch or drawing of what looks like a UFO or some kind of aerial object. The object is depicted as an elliptical or oval shape with a number of curved lines or markings on it. There is also some handwritten text in the image, but the quality of the scan makes it difficult to clearly read.
