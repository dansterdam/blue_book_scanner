The image does not contain any photographs. It is a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document.

According to the text in the image:

that the radar personnel may have been looking at the planet Venus, very low and bright on the western horizon at this time, and that the radar possibly encountered the aforementioned weather interference at the same time. This might result in a high degree of coincidence, however, and the radar and visual sightings seem to give much weight to the theory that the objects were maneuvering different objects.
Two other items added to the completeness of the report: ATIC supplied the reporting intelligence officer with a USAF Technical Information Sheet, or a visual questionnaire, and an Electronics Data Sheet covering the radar pick-up. Further analysis of this material might with authentic weather charts for the date of sighting establish this report as an unknown, carried in Project Blue Book's files as an unknown.
