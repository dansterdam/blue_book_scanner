This is the text from the document:

This witness appears to be a reputable person, a Sergeant in the United States Air Force. He was stationed at Cambria Air Force Station, California.

He states that on the night of 6 August 1957, at approximately 2200 hours, he observed a metallic object in the sky. This object appeared to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter and was located at an estimated altitude of 500 to 1000 feet.

The object was described as having a brilliant light in the center, with a reddish-orange glow around the outer edges. It appeared to be floating and oscillating as it moved. The witness stated that the object seemed to be heading in a southerly direction.

The witness further stated that the object remained in view for approximately 3 to 5 minutes before it accelerated and disappeared from sight.

The incident was reported to the Commanding Officer of the Cambria Air Force Station, and the witness was requested to contact the Office of Special Investigations shortly after the incident.
