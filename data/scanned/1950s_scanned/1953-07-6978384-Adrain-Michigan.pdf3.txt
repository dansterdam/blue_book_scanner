The 15 minutes the object had disappeared from sight had elapsed approximately the object was at any position I could see and the observer advised me that the course appeared to be on a perfect horizontal course at an evend-slow speed when suddenly it appeared to accelerate rapidly and attain an extremely high speed and disappear to the east far out over the trees. 
When I say it appeared to be 6 inches in diameter and seemed to be at an estimated distance of 20 to 25 miles, but as I say, it may hare been only a matter of seconds or even less when the object attained a very high speed and disappeared aver the trees to the east.
It is quite difficult to state with certainty just what type of object this was, but the undersigned is convinced that from the appearance, hovering, and extreme acceleration it could not have been a conventional type aircraft.
There was a note around the room.
