The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

4 August 1959

Dear Mrs. [REDACTED],

As mentioned in our telephone conversation today, I am enclosing two Air Force questionnaires to be used in connection with your recent Unidentified Flying Object sighting.

You and your neighbor should complete the forms and forward them direct to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for analysis and evaluation.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
