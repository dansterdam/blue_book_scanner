2. Interrogations and investigations disclosed the following:

SOURCE: A. Light observed was from an undetermined, but probably ground source.

"Up incline" Locale is in a hilly area. It was observed that there were on an up incline which caused the light to appear unusually low and prolonged as described by observers.

4. With regard to the allegations... the investigators concluded that there was no evidence to substantiate the contention that an unidentified flying object or a satellite was involved in the incident.
