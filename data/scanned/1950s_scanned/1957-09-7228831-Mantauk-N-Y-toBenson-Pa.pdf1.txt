Possibly Astronomical
Insufficient Data for Evaluation
Investigations disclose that there was an equipment malfunction. When the targets disappeared, spurious targets discontinued. It was also shown in the case that the practice of "splitting" radar beams did not follow standard procedures for correlating with ground-radar and air-intercept operations. Also, the tracks shown on the recording screen were completed by a radar-equipped plane in a normal mission.
