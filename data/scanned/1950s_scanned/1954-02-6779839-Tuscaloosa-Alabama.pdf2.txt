Both Myself And Mr. [redacted] were keeping 
a close watch on the balloon. I observed first two objects
in formation - Very quickly they were joined by four
others. The five objects were observed to join formation
in trail behind the leader. They appeared very quickly
and joined this trail formation. While in formation they
were spaced very evenly. When I saw three of the
objects I asked Mr. [redacted] what he could see.
He saw exactly what I did. [redacted] While he was watching 
I took pictures with a 16 mm Bolex with a 6" Telephoto 
lens. As I was taking pictures the objects moved
slowly under the balloon and to a due direction. Very
suddenly the objects seemed to go straight up at
right angles to their level flight position. They
remained in perfect trail formation and seemed to
"peel or break" straight up at terrific speed and
disappear.

In my opinion these were not reflections from
the aircraft wind shield nor were they reflections from
the balloon. The sky was a clear deep blue and the
objects . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The objects I feel were
almost . . . . . . . . must have been clear though I did not have
time to adjust the f stops properly.
