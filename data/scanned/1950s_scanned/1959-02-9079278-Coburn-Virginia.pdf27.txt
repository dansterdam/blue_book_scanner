The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, featuring a handwritten response to a questionnaire about a UFO sighting.

Transcription of the text in the document:

20. *Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, a "Y" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.*

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand 
(Circle One):
a. Head of a pin 
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Nickel
e. Quarter  
f. Half dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22):
a. Certain
b. Fairly certain
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? They went out of sight.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object which you saw. What type material would you use if you were to make it? And what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a man-made object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

1. Made from some light-colored metal in a circular shape, with a dome on the top and a sharply turned bright edge underneath, which gave the impression of a glow or light.

2. The only thing I could think of as a similar object produced in the sky would be an airplane, but this was much larger than any plane I have ever seen and did not have any visible wings, engines, or other air-craft accessories.
