FLIGHT NO.: 4602a ATIS
INITIAL PART THREE: Report #D-40-608-4-56
STATEMENT ON SIGHTING: Curiosity brought us to consider it other than a star-like object a, phenomenon caused us to do this. The object appeared to move in a zig-zag motion, then it would stop, then move to the left again (SW) and the lower and seemed to move in a vertical plane at this point. I personally did not see any lights on the object as it appeared black in color. After moving as described for some time the object seemed to move to the left again (SW) and disappeared from view. I personally feel the object was not a star-like object or an aircraft but some type of unidentified flying object.
