There is no photograph in this image. The image shows a page of typewritten text with some handwritten notes and redactions. I will reproduce the text below:

[The rest of the text is unclear due to the quality of the document.]
```

Please note that "CMA" likely stands for "comma" and is used to indicate where commas would be in the text, and "PD" may stand for "period." The text contains gaps and redactions. The date at the bottom seems to read "30/11/52 JUL. JESVA," possibly indicating July 30, 1952, although the letters following July are not a clear month abbreviation. The handwritten notation "Cy 1" is present at the end of the main text block. Additionally, there are some words and possibly numbers at the very bottom of the page, which are too faint to be legible.
