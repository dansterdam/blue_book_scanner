Dear Miss Walker:

I was very glad indeed to get your letter of the 27th of June.
As a matter of fact, I had been looking for it.

I have had the investigation of this particular case started,
and I will, as soon as possible, send you the findings.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation
for the very courteous treatment which we received from your
entire group.

Sincerely yours,

A. FRANCIS ARCIER
