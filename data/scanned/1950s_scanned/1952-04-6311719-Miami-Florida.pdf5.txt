The image appears to be a hand-drawn sketch or diagram depicting a circular object with the text "FADE OUT AT EDGE" written above it. There is also a numerical value of "9.1.5" written below the sketch.

Since the image does not contain any human faces, I will proceed to extract the text from the document:

FADE OUT AT EDGE
9.1.5
