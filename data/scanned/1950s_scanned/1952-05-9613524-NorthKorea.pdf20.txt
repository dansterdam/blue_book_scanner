1. North Korea - 26 May 1952
An F-94 flying a mission was told by ground radar that there was an unidentified object on its tail. The interceptor aircraft turned into the unknown and locked on with its radar at 7000 yds, and started a climb after the object. The object out-climbed the F-94 and maintained a steady climbing turn.
The airborne radar was checked for malfunction before and after the mission and found to be in perfect condition. No exhaust patterns from the unknown were noticed. Pilot - 1 year experience.
Solutions: Possible malfunction of airborne radar set.
