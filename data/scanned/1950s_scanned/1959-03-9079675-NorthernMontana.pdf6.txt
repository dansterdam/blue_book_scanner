Observed by: Capt. John J. Smith, Capt. R.T. Reynolds.
Location: 30 miles north of Great Falls, Montana. 
Time: 20:20 MST, 3/9/59.
Weather: clear sky, light breeze, temp. approx 10° F.

The object was first observed in the northwest at an angle of approximately 45° above the horizon. It was traveling in a northeasterly direction at an estimated speed of 500 - 600 mph. The object was described as being cone-shaped, with a definite front and rear end. It glowed with a reddish-orange color and left no trail. The object was observed for approximately 1 minute before it disappeared from sight.

Capt. Smith and Capt. Reynolds were flying an RB-36 at 30,000 ft. when they first observed the object. They immediately reported the sighting to the radar controller at Great Falls AFB. The radar controller stated that he had the object painted on his scope but could not identify it. 

The above information is submitted for your evaluation and filing.
