A witness in Wilmington, Cal- ifornia who did not wish to have his name revealed, reported that at about 11:00 PM, August 1950, he saw an object in the sky that appeared to be maneuvering as if it were searching. He said that the object moved very slowly and silently at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. He stated that it was shaped like a disc and emitted a yellowish-white light. The object remained in sight for about five minutes before it slowly climbed straight up and out of sight. He reported this sighting to the Air Force and was interviewed by an official of that organization.
