ORIGINATING AGENCY: DES 9, 1958 - DJE,F AISS 

D. WATER TRAFFIC:

Describes that the Ferryboat, crossing between Rockland Harbor, Maine (OSCNRP BLKT 2182), and Islesboro, Maine (OSCNRP BLKT 2182), which was operating between the two points, was ferrying civilians and auto transport for vacationers to the island of Islesboro, Maine. This Ferryboat does not appear to have any meteorological relation or connection with the crew of unidentified aircraft. Weather conditions on the dates indicated would rule out the possibility of weather traffic causing the sighting, and that the Ferryboat most likely would not attempt the crossing under such weather conditions.
