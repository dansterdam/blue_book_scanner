I just wish to state, that there were no stars nor saw snow snow as it was cloudy, and that it was a definite object coming through the sky. The annoying thing was, that it did not turn gradually one but made a sharp turn and seemed to disappear, then it appeared again, then disappeared. I imagine if it was an astronomical feature it would seem to fall whereas this seemed though the air like an airplane would.
