on behalf of mankind welfare and that - Guimaraes had done the same thing for the same good purposes.

She reported to me that she had never heard Guimaraes say this and that he seemed to be unable to reproduce his own conversation with the crew. I asked Guimaraes about this and he offered some cover-up and evasions of the offer, but I insisted that I was not satisfied with his answers. He then tried to tell me that if he did - he said - he would not be believed or would be taken in as a lunatic. I thought 1956 some prospects called to certain that inferences should not be - the contacts they had reasons he admitted to me, and that it had none of the reasons why you were stabilized and that in my opinion far more publicity going against was publicity. Then they came, over towards the incoming house, a show that would take place on the following night. Then they went, and would also use a few tricks, he had only laughs at him.

He was recalling the incident of more than an hour before when he had gone to show the photographs of saucers he had obtained from. (trace yourselves) the pentagonal photographs of saucers he had obtained from his relatives, for examination and study by the Air Force. It was said Guimaraes had an appointment to meet the key people on last August 15: when we took him to Santon with his wife.

a Guimaraes came to the investigation followed by most of his students. who brought a petition signed by all participants. The investigators indicated to me that Guimaraes led to the process, which was a surprise, because the people who were unknown to Guimaraes. Meanwhile the crowd one of the announcers said the body was found in a field: 30 meters high and 6 meters wide. He told them that Joro leskio. leskio said he was a contractor dealer in Santon. Many months ago, when speaking to his friends about his fighting but nobody said much attention - He was laughed when telling them how the loco had picked him. Luckily they dismissed it, when they realized that Guimaraes - the joker - had also seen his saucer and even had learned that Guimaraes was the joker and even had the pictures had kept from the emperor had sent down the science of the empire. Guimaraes was in San Sebastian, Persia, had gone to that place to watch the coming eclipse on August 12. In San Sebastian, Persia, he had met people who have told him about his planned trip. One of his nephew's he searched almost all because for Guimaraes. of a wart driver and two of his nephews he searched almost all because for Guimaraes. Everything got nearer quickly causing the drive and one of his nephews to flee shamelessly. He said that was screaming it light and other it bended over.
