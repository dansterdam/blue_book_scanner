Regarding the text found in the document:

Lear was standing in his yard observing the sky when he heard the roar of jet planes overhead. He observed the object appear to be stationary, but then suddenly began moving. The object emitted light and was of enormous size, traveling at a fantastic rate of speed. Lear called the Perkins Observatory to report the sighting. The text mentions that two tiny particles of light appeared, then on the sphere, and then a kind of explosion occurred, although there was no noise. The text also states that more specks of light kept coming until the object could no longer be seen, and that there were at least 100 in the group.

During the observation, the sphere moved from its stationary point and then traveled into the west, where it was finally hidden from view by a cloud. Lear's wife, Frances, also saw the object through the telescope, but could not manipulate it. The text states that Lear was hesitant in telling the story, but his neighbors confirmed that they had also seen the mysterious object.
