STATEMENT OF SENIOR CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR, PRESQUE ISLE AFB, MAINE
1. While on the late contest with the 18th Tow Target Sq in 1956, I was observing the activity from the tower. At approximately 1800 hours I observed an unidentified light in the sky, south of the station, which appeared as an ascending light of the color of flaming magnesium. It rapidly gained altitude. The color was variable, being purple, blue, green and the colors of the cold flame type of magnesium. The light seemed to be oscillating and pulsating an average of 1 1/2 seconds. For approximately 10 seconds I observed the light, I would estimate its altitude at from 20,000 to 25,000 feet.

Northwest Airlines flight 12 coming into Presque Isle was observed during the time that I observed the light, and the light was in no way connected with the aircraft, as I also observed the aircraft separate and unconnected with the light.
I would in no way determine its attitude or distance from the station, but would say it was in the west, and some distance away. I attach no significance to the object, other than the fact that I observed it, and it was not of a nature that I could determine.
