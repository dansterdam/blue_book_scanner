1. The attached negatives were submitted to this office by a professional photographer now in the employ of M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratories. The photographs appear to show objects that appear to be between two and three years old and were not submitted during that time for fear of ridicule. The reported objects appear at the bottom of the film and show a vertical and horizontal movement. The pictures were taken facing out over the Charles River with Boston on the horizon. The prints indicate the film was developed as soon as taken and nothing inherently wrong with the film to cause the markings in question.

2. Mr. ___ would like to have the enclosed negatives back in a reasonable length of time. This office would appreciate an estimate of what is showing on the film so that Mr. ___ can be given some sort of statement upon his return.
