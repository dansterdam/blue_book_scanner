Aug 30, 1957

Dear Air,

The air past the objects which we saw on Aug 19 at 10:00 PM. 
The colors etc. were much brighter and had a blue tint, but 
DDG were the brightest objects. 
I'd seen them near to the sky.

For a 35 mm old movie projector we command a Dufaycolor
as a fitting match as I'm sure you recognize they were just the same
make of this nature.

Yours truly,
