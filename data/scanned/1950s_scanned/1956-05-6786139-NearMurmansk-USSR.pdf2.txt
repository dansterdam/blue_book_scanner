(U) Observation of Unusual Phenomenon

1. According to a newspaper report from Moscow on 26 May 1956 the crew on board a troop ship has stated that they have witnessed fantastic phenomena off the Russian Coast between Teriberski and Murmansk in the Barents Sea a few days previously. They related that they observed a so-called "flying saucer" perform the various maneuvers over the ship and that it performed with incredible speed. They estimated that it was about twice the size of an American commercial airliner, and that it "actually shot like a streak of lightning through the air."

2. A translation of this press release if included on page two of this report.
