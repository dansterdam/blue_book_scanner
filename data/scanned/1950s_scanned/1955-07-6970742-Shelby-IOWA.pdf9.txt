1. In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was possibly caused by an airplane, for the following reasons:

a. The color of the lights and their flashing would be those of an aircraft.
b. The lack of motion could be explained by wind or by a helicopter or a convertiplane.  
c. The description of the white lights sounds like landing or maybe search-lights.
d. Investigation discovered no balloon or astronomical activity that would account for the sighting.

Officer in Charge

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:

1. - This headquarters does not agree with the possibility of an aircraft generated sighting as set forth by the Preparing Officer for the following reasons:

a. The duration of the sighting was too long for that of an aircraft.
b. The object appeared to remain motionless for more than two and one-half hours.
c. This headquarters offers the hypothesis that this sighting was possibly caused by a balloon for the following reasons:
d. The object remained high and motionless for a long period of time.
e. Viewing of ordinary white light through low power optical instruments such as binoculars used can induce colors which object does not actually possess.
f. Balloons of the rawindsonde type, released from Air Force Weather Stations and detachments thereof daily, can be seen after dark up to an altitude of forty thousand feet without visual side.
g. The revolving of the balloon or oscillation of the suspension train (carrying the modulator units), caused by wind currents, could account for the flashing lights and the beams of light which at times came from the object.
