The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a Project 10073 record card from Cairo, Egypt dated July 6, 1956. The record card provides details about the sighting, including the location, type of observation, number of objects, course, and a brief summary of the sighting. The record card notes that seven images were sent for analysis, and provides conclusions about the sighting, indicating that two of the images were identified as birds, while three dot-like faults were likely caused by mechanical means such as scratches or vibrations.
