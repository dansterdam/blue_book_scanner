 Apr. 2--Coffeyville, Kan.--Mr. H. Smith was awakened when his
 wife became alarmed over the increasing velocity of the wind short
 ly after 6 A.M. Said he: "I went outside to check the clouds and 
 to my astonishment saw this illuminated object gliding down toward 
 neighbor's house. There was no framework visible, but the lighted

 body appeared somewhat heavier than the standard airplane with a
 wingspread of about 30 feet. It hovered over the Joe Forbish res
 idence, then 500 feet south over our house, at which it began 300 feet.
 altitude, then glided across the road to Alboro in the Thompson sec
 zon house before starting toward our house. Mrs. Smith 
 saw the object reached our place, however, it veered off and
 started to ascend again. Just then, Mrs. Smith came out to see 
 what was keeping and saw it along the street. For a few minutes,
 it appeared to emit some sort of light from it and then disappeared
 into the clouds." (Coffeyville Daily Journal, 4/3.)
