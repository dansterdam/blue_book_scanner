Text from the document:

company覺ng noise came from the area of the object. The "explos覺ons" were about ten to fifteen seconds apart. At first, we thought some elee* tric light wires shorting in back of our building's dome until the "explosions" were seen. A call to Dayton Power and Light on the morning of the 5th d覺sctosed no electrical disturbances or service calls in this area, and WPAFI was not testing high photograpl覺y on the 4th of December.
