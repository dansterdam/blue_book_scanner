The Secretary for Defence,
The Pentagon,
WASHINGTON D.C.

Sir,

While on vacation here I saw early this morning a peculiar light in the sky which seemed to be flashing irregularly for which I could not account, and I feel that I should report it. It was certainly not an aircraft, and followed the irregular pattern on the enclosed sketch. The elapsed time in passing from east to south-east was perhaps two minutes.

Yours very truly,

(Col., British Army)
