SIR:
The officials of Project Blue Book already have reports of an aerial object seen in the vicinity of Indianapolis, Ind. on the night of 12 July 1952. The object was observed by my wife and I and it is our duty to report as much as we can in view of the fact that we saw the object and feel it is our responsibility to provide all information possible concerning this incident. The object was very good. The following is an account of the incident as I saw it:

On the night of July 12, 1952, my family and I were attending an outdoor theater in the vicinity of Indianapolis, Ind. At approximately 9:10 p.m. CST, my wife and I observed an object in the sky, this object was traveling in a north-westerly direction. It looked larger than any star and was going in a north-westerly direction. It seemed to be traveling much faster than any jet or aircraft we have ever seen. There appeared to be a very slight glowing tail or exhaust. It seemed to be at an altitude of approximately 20,000 to 30,000 feet. The sighting lasted for about four seconds. It was initially seemed to fade and wink out. But it seemed to me that it was at an altitude of perhaps one hundred miles per hour.

It is quite possible that this object was motor or fireworks, but it is like none I have ever seen. I could hear no planes in the vicinity, neither could I hear any sound from the object. I hope this has already been explained, if not I hope you can explain it.

Respectfully,
Lt. Lt.
U.S. Army
