PRELIMINARY CONCLUSION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT
OF SAN AMERICAN AIRLINE CAPACITY
ON 9 MARCH 1957

1. There is no compelling reason to believe that the object observed that night by the pilot of San American Airline Capacity and his co-pilot was other than a meteor, but the object conforms exactly with the description of fireball reports received by the Air Technical Intelligence Center during the last two years.

2. Interrogation of Captains (...) by the New York units of the 4602d Air Intelligence Service Squadron further substantiates this conclusion. His detailed description, in brief, of "a bright light with a green halo," coincided with the description given by the other crew members.

3. These objects are extremely bright, resembling premium grade and while objects. They continue to descend at a very high but controlled rate of speed, frequently in a pitch-black night, in almost vertical-like descent.

4. The fact that another pilot 17s miles away observed these same objects at the same time would indicate that the aircraft and guided missiles in the area at the time, and Patriot Air Force Base. advises no operations were conducted at that section.

5. The attempt by the press to connect this sighting with alleged relates Venus was not visible at that time and place. This was not visible at the time and place reported, at approximately 5:30 in the morning, at an approximate cost of $2,000,000.
