Dear Sir:

Reference is made to your letter of inquiry, dated 13 November 1958. A close check of our records for that date indicates that we were not in contact with any aircraft in the general vicinity of Fairfax, Oklahoma at the time you specified.

Our personnel on duty received no pilot's reports of such sightings. Also, I have heard no general discussion about it at this airport.

If we can be of further assistance, please feel free to let us know.

Yours truly,

Walter H. Pattinson
Chief, Tulsa Tower
