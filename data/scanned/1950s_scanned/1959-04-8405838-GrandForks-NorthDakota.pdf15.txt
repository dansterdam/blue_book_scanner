Dear Colonel Terry

I refer to your communication dated 1 August 1960.

If possible, and they are not classified, I should like to reduce copies of the regulations which deny me access to the accident report and/or cause factors of the C-118 crash of 1 April 1959.

On 23 March 1960, Lt. Col. Lawrence J. Tucker, USAF, Public Information Division, Department of the Air Force, Office of the Secretary, Washington, told Mr. [REDACTED] 

"The Air Force findings on the C-118 Trans- port Crash 1 April 1959 were prior error and not the result of thorough and judicious inquiry."

Does the Flight and Missile Safety Research Directorate concur in this statement? If so, why was the data, and not I, given to the public through some other means.

I would also like to know if the accident report and/or cause factors of the aforementioned crash are officially classified as "Top Secret", "Secret", or "Confidential" or are withheld from the public through some other means.

Sincerely yours,

[REDACTED]
