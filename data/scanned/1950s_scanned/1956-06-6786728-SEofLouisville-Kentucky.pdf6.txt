TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

Guess and the answers were always telepathic. They had come on a mission of investigation. Several times the newspapers had received messages that such and such saucers had crashed near Louisville, but they had not made good his word because someone belonging to his family had died the day before. It was known that in July 1952 the newspapers had agreed not to tell where they knew anything about his adventure, and that's why on August 12, 1957 the newspapers now started disclosing the story.

The flying saucers were working on remote control from some place and the captain or the ship rotates contrary wise; this producing "strangulation" and maneuvering. On the saucer, there was a small window about two feet in diameter in the center and also around the edge, spaced evenly, were several view ports or special devices on the top of the dome and around the outer rim of the saucer.
Off and on as currents would be picked up, the ports would open and close. As I looked inside the ship there was only one instrument. It was a circle like in a gyroscope and it was running funny. Wherever the saucer went, this instrument guided it.

This is the close up drawn by professor Guimaraes.

On August 14th, TV Channel 3 had advertised, would present Guimaraes between 12:00 to 1:00. TV Channel 3, what announced, was a "FLYING SAUCER" story. It was agreed that the story would not tell where the saucer had been found. Guimaraes had repeated the whole story. It was agreed that the story would not mention about $5,000 that Guimaraes had been offered to buy his silence.

I tried in vain to talk to Guimaraes privately but the crowd of curious people were so great that I could not get to him. Some men with me were my wife, Dr. Marie Cuatra Godinho and Dr. Jayme Vassis the former Governor's Secretary. After our trip began, we all were sure that Mr. Guimaraes should be foggy minutes after our trip began, we all were sure that Mr. Guimaraes should have some means of transportation or communication other than with us. He said he had never read a book about saucers, nevertheless he suddenly mentioned things that led us to believe his story.

I said to myself that whatever I discovered about Guimaraes, I would not harm him in any way, as I am aware of their motives. Indeed, I felt privileged to have seen the luminosities of several related layers; these layers are responsible for the peculiar effects on certain people.  While we are worrying about our scientific misgivings, people from other worlds are wiser, more powerful and as mystical as the luminosities of several joined layers. I told him [Guimaraes] that even if what he showed us was a hoax, I would never expose him, because he had the moral courage to invent a story that could hold water.
