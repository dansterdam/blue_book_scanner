9. COMMENTS: "Photographs" through telescope. One photograph of moon through telescope, exposure so short (about 1/500 sec) that the irregular motion of the object could not have impressed on the film. Object apparently not an aircraft - no sound - no running lights - too fast and erratic. Illumination similar to that of a meteor but without the characteristic trail." (Analysis by [ ] )
