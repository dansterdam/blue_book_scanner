AFCIN-4E2 Weekly Activity Report

SUBJECT: UFO Program  11 March 1959

1. On 10 November 1958, Major Robert F. Friend and Major Vesco OLLER, D.D. of the Aerial Phenomena Group, AFCIN-4E2, made a trip to the Montville, Ohio area for the purpose of investigating an Unidentified Flying Object sighting reported to the Sheriff's office by Mr. R., who lives near Montville. This case is an old case of 6 November 1957, but has caused the Air Force much in the way of enquiries, and to some extent endangered its prestige, due to exploitation by private UFO investigators.

2. The Air Technical Intelligence Center had no report from an Air Force source on Mr. R., himself; therefore, all of the information was obtained from Mr. R. firsthand and as such reliability considered reasonable.

3. The investigation was successful. Mr. R. was very cooperative and it was learned that many of the statements attributed to him were very inaccurate. One such statement as that he had turned this information over to the Defense Department and interrogated for two days, then warned not to mention where he had been or why. This investigation was carried on to the Air Technical Intelligence Center's conclusion that the UFO was probably a "fireball".
