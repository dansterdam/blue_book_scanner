U.F.O. SEEN EARLY THIS MORNING OVER WASHINGTON

Today I will have to admit that I have been converted to the strange phenomena which they call "flying objects". On two other occasions I have seen the same type of object, but this time I saw it from its beginning until it disappeared. It was moving across the sky at tower altitude and appeared to be somewhat oval in shape. It was a brilliant white light, varying in intensity, and it took 4 or 5 minutes to pass completely out of sight. It was carefully observed at a distance of about 40 miles when I first noticed it. At that distance it appeared to be about the size of a half dollar at arm's length. It moved across the sky in a straight line at a very uniform speed and finally disappeared over the eastern horizon. All of the other lights on the object except the hub remained bluish. The hub remianed steadily bright like a flashlight from my position, steadily moving again toward the east. It made no sound whatsoever. I snapped and awoke my wife to observing it with me. She finally gave up and went back to bed, while I continued to observe this object until it disappeared from sight.
