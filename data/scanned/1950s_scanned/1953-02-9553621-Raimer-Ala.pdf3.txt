Ramer, Alabama 16 February 1953 

I. Description of Incident:

Two civilian men at this location sighted an unidentified object at 1620 EDST while watching the flight of an F-86 interceptor across their field of vision. A metallic looking object appearing round at one instant and flat the next was seen at an altitude of about 15,000 ft. Its maneuvers consisted of climbing, diving, and sharp, abrupt turns to the left and right in and around a formation of clouds in a manner suggesting controlled flight. The time of sighting was for 20 minutes.

II. Discussion of Incident:

Although the Maxwell Radio Range Station reported no known aircraft other than the F-86 interceptor which the two relatively inexperienced observers probably sighted, they possibly sighted a fighter type aircraft, possibly an F-86, maneuvering in the air space below the B-47. To support this conclusion is the fact that the clouds mentioned in the original report around which the object was sighted were determined to be at 20,000 ft. At this altitude a fighter aircraft would be hard to distinguish from the object appeared to have even-back

III. Conclusion:

Possibly aircraft.
