STATEMENT

On 5 Aug 53 while working as a _____________, home on San Antonio, Texas, I saw an unidentifiable object in the sky at about 1000 to 1015 hours. It appeared to be about the size of the bottom of a 5 1/2 tub and shaped like a silver. We saw no vapor trails or exhaust smoke, and didn't hear any sound of motors. It just hung in the sky for about 5 or 5 minutes with a white gray exhaust end. I was startled about 20 feet from a gin pole that I was working on and was looking to see if it was a strange. At an angle from my eyes, looking over a piece of rope a foot from the top of a 35 ft gin pole, I spotted this object. I called my office and asked what was happening, as we were home we working, they all stated they saw it. It was surprising to see this strange object hovering overhead with no apparent means of propulsion. I certainly that this statement is truthful and correct to the best of my knowledge.
