I was one OF (Oslist) OF 3 at about 0500, 6 November 1957, at Kaisong, Korea, for about 3 minutes. After telephoning at 0550, about 2 minutes later, I reported in to my Company and did not see any object. It was a clear night, I pointed the vapor out to me, though it was some kind of light, it had the same appearance of that of the bright light trailing off to the right. 

I was about 150 feet in length, and about 25 inches in length, tight, and the angle of about 45 degrees to the left, it seemed to be quite still and the light was very bright, I could not actually see any object, it was a clear flight,
