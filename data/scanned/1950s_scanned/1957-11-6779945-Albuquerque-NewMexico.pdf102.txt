Dear Sir:

A copy of this unclassified letter will be sent to the publishers for nationwide distribution. The enclosed information should be included for public relations.

1. That the Air Force has an unusual disregard for the facts and a strange unattractiveness to the truth.
2. That the Air Force refuses to abide by its own written objectives.

All of my UFO sighting experiences have led me to conclude that the Air Force has no answers concerning the UFO phenomenon and has failed, either willfully or through inability, to make an objective study of the subject. The last nine months of my active duty with the Air Force have been a nightmare of strictures, prevention orders, and defeats of my efforts to state the facts truthfully. The Air Force makes a very definite obligation to identify and publicly explain all UFO sightings, yet in this case they refuse to do so.

Sincerely,
Lawrence J. Tacker
Major General, USAF
