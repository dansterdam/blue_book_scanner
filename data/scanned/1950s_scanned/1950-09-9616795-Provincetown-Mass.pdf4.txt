TO: Director, Evans Signal Laboratory, SCRL 	10/6/52

Our best estimate of the speed of the "Saucer" was 22 miles per minute.  For approximately half of this one minute during which we were tracking it, it was circling in its sharp turn.  The acceleration in this sharp turn comes out to 11 or 12 G as well as we can figure it.

We did not detect that the object gave off any light of its own during the day.  Our call from the Weather Officer came about noon on September 12, 1952.  He reported seeing an object which he described as "confidential" as far as any general publicity was concerned.  The following day we had a visit from two men (from the Director of Special Investigations, I believe) and we described to them what we observed essentially as it is described above.  We have not reported this observation to any other group up to this date.

Very truly yours,
WALTER RADAR RESEARCH
