Headquarters, United States Air Force, Directorate of Intelligence, Washington, D.C.

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

1. Reference is made to previous correspondence on the subject of unidentified flying objects. Recent information received indicates that the subject of unidentified flying objects continues to be of interest both to the public and certain elements of the United States Government. 

2. While there have been a number of reported sightings which could not be readily explained, the majority of such reports have been found to be either misidentification of familiar objects or the result of psychological factors operating on the observer. A small percentage, however, have remained unexplained. These unexplained sightings have been carefully analyzed and various scientific factors have been considered in an effort to determine their nature.

3. During the course of the investigation of these unexplained sightings, it has been found that a considerable amount of detailed information has been accumulated, much of which is of a technical and classified nature. It has been determined that the continued collection and analysis of this type of information is desirable in the interests of national security.

4. Accordingly, it is requested that you designate a qualified officer or officers within your headquarters to serve as a liaison point of contact with this Directorate on matters pertaining to unidentified flying objects. The purpose of this liaison will be to insure the prompt and complete exchange of information on this subject which may be of mutual interest and concern.

     Very truly yours,

     [SIGNATURE REDACTED]
