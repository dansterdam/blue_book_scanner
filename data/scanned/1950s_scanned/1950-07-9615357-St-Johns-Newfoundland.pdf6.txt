2. UNCLASSIFIED

I saw an object which appeared in all details to be a comet going from 
East to West on a track south of my position. It was impossible to
determine the distance to the object or its size. It appeared as a
burning object with a long wake. I watched it for several seconds,
after which it appeared to split into two portions and disintegrate be­
fore any angle of descent was noticed. It broke up in mid-air much in
the manner of a disintegrating comet. I first noticed it at approxi­
mately a 45° angle to my left and it crossed before me and disintegrated
at approximately a 45° angle to my right. My window faces magnetic
South.

and stated at 2205 local time, Pepperrell Air Force Base was questioned
and stated at 2205 local time, 31 July 1950, Sgt M.Z. Nicodemus and I
left the NCO Club. We followed the sidewalk that runs along the north
side of the NCO Club. We were facing in a westerly direction. Upon
coming to the end of the club building, Sgt. Nicodemus called my at­
tention to a flame that could be seen in the air. No object was
discernable. The general direction of travel was Northwest. The
estimated altitude was between 3 to 5 thousand feet. Approximate
distance from the NCO Club put object, I would say, over the west end
of Quidi Vidi Lake. The object appeared from the general direction
of Cabot Tower and seemed to disappear near the top of Kanaws Hill.
In my opinion, the burning charge was of a rocket type. The flame was
of a bluish color changing to a reddish orange at the tail of the flame.
At one point the flame seemed to fade out as though it were burned out,
then the flame seemed to renew itself as though fresh charge had been
set off. It is possible that the object could have passed behind a
scud cloud. The weather at the time of sighting was good. There were
some strata clouds to the west and some scud clouds overhead. Cloud
coverage was about 3/10. Stars were visible. The object was not
travelling at a great rate of speed. The object was seen for no
longer than 15 seconds.
