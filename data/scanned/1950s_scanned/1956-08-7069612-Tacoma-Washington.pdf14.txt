Case 188, Cortland and Ithaca, N.Y. August 14, 1956 - In a letter to CRIFO, Lynn Strutt writes in part, "Around 3:30 a.m. my brother and I saw 2 bright blue-green lights, in a formation over Cortland and at a point about 200 yards southwest of Cortland in the southwest. We saw two beams of lights shoot out of these objects about a half hour apart. There was no sound or blinking lights from the unknown objects except one flicked off its lights for a matter of seconds." There came a brighter flash than before which seemed to burst out of the visual sight. They became more distinct at 3:30 a.m. when my brother and I started home. All of a sudden we saw the lights in a long line spread apart. They moved across the sky and then started to move slowly toward Ithaca. These six lights were much brighter than our earlier observation. They looked like stars, but they were moving. As they neared Ithaca, they seemed to disappear one by one to the next one. Unless anyone was watching the sky for we were, these lights could easily be mistaken for a plane. An interesting thing about this sighting is that it certainly puts a different light on saucers as being merely "Conventional aircraft, meteorological or astronomical phenomena."
