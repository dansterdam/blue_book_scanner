The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It contains a detailed grid chart with various measurements and markings, but there is no photograph present in this particular image.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the output of all the text found in the document:

PUBLISHED BY THE AERONAUTICAL CHART AND INFORMATION CENTER, 
AIR PHOTOGRAPHIC AND CHARTING SERVICE, (USAF)
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE, ST. LOUIS 18, MISSOURI, APR. 15, 1954
