Room, Barta & Watershaw: The Army Engi
Bulletin-Washington, Sept. 27, 1957, B.4. 
15,000 copies. 
This is one of a series of publications plan-
ned to be printed by the Army Corps of En-
gineers to interpret and explain the work
of the Army to the public.
The Army Corps of Engineers, although
not primarily concerned with the UFO pro-
blem, has participated in a special study of
the subject at the request of the Air Force.
Edgar R. Henry, Director, Army Develop-
ment and Proof Services, Aberdeen Proving
Ground, Md. says that the Army has had oc-
casional sightings reported to them, and
that they have furnished certain data on re-
quest from the Air Force. 
as U.S. Army Physics Advances in Research
and Engineering Develops Technical Plans
Among the scientific activities in this field
is the plan of the Army Medical Service to
publish two volumes in the near future on
"Aviation Medicine and Space Medicine".
Progress in related fields is also reported.
Professor Graner, and C. Garner, of the Ar-
my Ordnance Research and Development
Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.,
have been working on the mechanism of
propelling solid particles at high velocities.
They report progress in this field that is clas-
sified secret. Other classified work relating
to the interests of the Air Force is also being
carried on at this center.
The Army may have developed other tech-
niques which could be of importance in the
UFO problem, but if so, information on them
would be classified.
