The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book.

Transcribed text from the document:

this is a commercially type and 
that I can refer to enter a contract. There are more commercial 
units to fly and we come to a third time claim to have had sightings, we have not
been able as yet to acquire the first units of the group concerned, we have had several
of the planes, indicating 4 they were the 
object and passed on that day. 

P.S. I only speak for myself and understand and
understand.
