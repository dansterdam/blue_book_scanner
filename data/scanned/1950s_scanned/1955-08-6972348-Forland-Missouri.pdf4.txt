The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report with text describing a sighting.

As an OCR system, I will output the text found in the document:

There was no AF evidence on the alleged target. It was never observed to move, and even though the original target was sighted by the witnesses, it was reported to be extremely bright before and immediately after DKT was in the area, it painted only very faintly while he was flying in the general vicinity.

The target was never seen to move, but after falling would always re-appear in another location.

It never took any other form than that of an aircraft target (in other words, it never looked like AF or weather).

Even though we plotted the track on 4 - 2:35 scope, it was impossible to overlap it to "Agree" for a track number, and through it was "probably" a "freak.

The above statement made by 1st Lt JOHN V. OLIVER, USAF, Director on Duty.
