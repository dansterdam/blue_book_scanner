Ohio's Air Officials Are Investigating "Flying Saucer" Story Related By Pilot

DAYTON, Ohio, June 24--Dayton Air Force Base officials would give no information on the sighting other than to say a "verbal report" had been received. A pilot, they said, had reported seeing a "white light" which he thought was a "flying saucer." The pilot, they said, was returning from a 45-minute training flight when the incident occurred. The pilot landed at the National Guard (OANG) base at Springfield Airport.

The official at the National Cash Register Co., where the pilot worked, said he had given a "verbal report" on the incident but added he was instructed not to discuss it further.

The pilot was quoted as saying he "picked up the object" while on a training flight, and that it followed him to the airport at Vandalia and then took off at high speed. The pilot said the object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter, and kept maneuvering above and behind him. He said he couldn't get it in his sights. The pilot finally lost sight of the object. Though it was still hovering, he said, when he landed the object did not reappear.

A spokesman in the area, apparently a member of the Air Force, said the incident was reported to officials at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. He added that he had no further information and could not confirm or deny the pilot's story.
