The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document containing text describing observations and characteristics of "green fireballs".

The text reads as follows:

"Dr. J. Kaplan of the Scientific Advisory Board is one such scientist, but he qualified his beliefs: "The daytime 'fireball' incidents are completely baffling. No meteor would persist for as long as thirty minutes." This duration is much longer than any recorded genuine meteoric incident.

The characteristics of the nocturnal green fireballs, of relatively the same height and having no sound, are ones which are difficult to observe without very careful instrumentation as to their (height).)

((Dr. Lincoln La Paz, director of the Institute of Meteoritics, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, made a comprehensive study of the fireballs and found that they were not meteors. Dr. La Paz contends "Most of the reports of 'green fireballs' state that they appear to move in horizontal paths, throughout its entire extent, to the plane of the horizon. Such persistent horizontality stands in the sharpest contrast to the downwardly concave paths traversed by genuine meteorites, when these penetrate deeply into the atmosphere of the earth.")

((In the case of genuine meteorite falls, with luminous paths terminating even at heights considerably greater than those at which the real paths of the green fireballs are situated, the observed luminous phenomena are always accompanied by extraordinarily violent noises. No noises whatever have been observed in connection with any one of the horizontally-moving green fireballs.))

((The anomalous greenish luminous phenomena show a curious association with well-known meteor showers, although none of these annual meteor showers normally produce extremely bright green fireballs. The relationship cited)"
