1952 JUL 22 09: 2

THE OBJECTS WHICH WERE SIGHTED WERE UNUSUAL IN APPEARANCE AND THEIR ACTIONS WERE UNUSUAL. MR. RICHARD CANNING AND MR. RICHARD HAGEN, WHO WERE THE WITNESSES, ARE RELIABLE PERSONS WHO HAVE HAD PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE IN OBSERVING CELESTIAL PHENOMENA AND JUDGING DISTANCES AND SIZES OF OBJECTS IN THE SKY. THEY REPORTED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE DISC-SHAPED, LUMINESCENT, AND MADE EXTREMELY RAPID MANEUVERS. THEY WERE OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES ON 22 JULY 52 FROM 0424Z TO 0444Z AND WERE SEEN BY SEVERAL OTHER RESIDENTS OF COLORADO SPRINGS, COLO.

IT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED TO A UNITED STATES AIR FORCE BASE. THIS IS THE INITIAL SIGHTING AS FAR AS IS KNOWN. SUBSEQUENT SIGHTINGS OF SIMILAR OBJECTS IN THE SAME AREA HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY OTHER RELIABLE WITNESSES, BUT DETAILS ARE STILL BEING VERIFIED.
