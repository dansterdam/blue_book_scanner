January 12, 1952

Of course, as I look up the street, the situation is much different. I can see evidence that indicates the landing of some kind of craft, which is probably not at all strange. For one thing, there are imprints in the snow, to the right of my automobile, and part of it is disturbed in a way that I cannot explain by the wind or anything else. This first that I observe distinctly is that there are signs indicating some kind of activity in this area.

Things are different, on the whole, from the usual. I may be mistaken, of course, but it is indeed impossible for anyone - not even myself - to make certain judgments as to what may have occurred here. There are certain things concerning which I am unable to come to any definite conclusion just now.

It is, after all, conceivable that there may be a perfectly natural and ordinary explanation for what I see. This is just what I cannot make up my mind about at the present time. I wish I could explain what I think I saw. You can estimate for yourself how far this goes beyond the ordinary and commonplace. In the long run, I suppose, the affair will be satisfactorily cleared up, but in the meantime I am left with a feeling of uncertainty.

No, let me make a second observation regarding this case. The several different views of the landscape, including the sky overhead, seem to indicate the possibility of some unusual activity here. If, as I think, this point is established, it suggests that there may be an entirely new realm of natural phenomena to be explored. There is not your usual ground, nor anything he can explain in the usual way, that is to say, in terms of those people and things we are accustomed to see and accept as the normal order of nature.

I accept your suggestion about the matter, but on the whole I cannot see how an event of this sort could be satisfactorily explained in any ordinary manner. It is hardly likely to be mere coincidence. I am merely trying to find out some of the basic details that did not appear in the official report.
