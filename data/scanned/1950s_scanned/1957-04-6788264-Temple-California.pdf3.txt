Army Digs for Mystery Object
Continued from first page.
His men dug cautiously at the spot for about half an hour. They
uncovered nothng and then decided to place several sticks of
explosive ordnance disposal tape around the hole and go away
for the night. At about 5 a.m. he returned to the vicinity,
due to fear down in the rocky ground, and without finding any
sign of a missile or explosive, set a guard during the night.
Lt. Col. STURDEY, a veteran, said they saw the object stopping
up and down in the air about 700 feet high for about two and
a half minutes shortly before 5 p.m. He ordered his men to dig,
but they uncovered nothing. He said the hole could have been
caused by a meteor, but that there was no sign of a missile or
bomb, as the base had initially feared. He said if the object
had been a missile or bomb, his men would have found some
fragments. He said there was an Air Force sighted report about
the time the UFO was seen, but the Air Force said it was not
missiles or aircraft.
