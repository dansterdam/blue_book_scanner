The text on the document reads:

3 at 1/2, Card 1/3
COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER: At 11:38 (JST) on 19 FEBRUARY 1958, a Japanese vessel experienced an explosion, was damaged at 44°20'N/135°58'E, and sank. The Air Force has concluded that this explosion was not caused by a nuclear explosion, and that instead, the source of the explosion has been determined to have been the detonation of explosives aboard the vessel. The preparing officer comments that this conclusion is supported by the following factors:

1. There were no indications of any abnormal radiological activity in the area.
2. The damage to the vessel is consistent with a chemical explosive device rather than a nuclear explosion.
3. Aerial surveys of the area revealed no indications of a nuclear explosion.
4. The Soviet-bloc nations did not file any protests, which would be expected if a nuclear explosion had occurred.

The document is dated May 20, 1958.
