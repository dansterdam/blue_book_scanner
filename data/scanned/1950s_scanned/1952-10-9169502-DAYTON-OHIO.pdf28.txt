Subject: 2 red lights observed at 15-20 miles - appeared across the zenith in a southeast to northwest direction - at a high speed as a jet aircraft, but the lights were twice as bright and the lights were smaller than an aircraft. Believe they were just a flight of jets not spotted earlier. No sound heard. Became more of a general report of unusual sightings.
You told your cousin you saw again, - the lights - they now come and go - do you actually see them - or recall seeing them.  They you are convinced with time you saw nothing. After chances of being questioned, my opinion is that you actually saw a flight of jets not previously discovered, that is explained in a very simple way. There is no evidence to be preserved and nothing important as an incident which could be treated scientifically. This is merely one of many thousands of sightings - which have explanations - if more time is taken to investigate carefully.
