Statement of Major _____

On Thanksgiving Day, 23 November 1950, between 1500 and 1525, I saw four objects which I could not identify. 
They appeared to be about 3/4" in diameter, perfectly circular and very bright. They were brilliantly white, almost porcelain white. By measuring the distance and time involved, they were moving very fast.
The first object came from about 2.0* end, and when over Lowndes2ry, ascended to a very great height. As it descended, it seemed to turn over and over. This object then moved off rapidly to the NE and disappeared.
I saw this object as it was descending over Lowndesboro and moving off to the NE, as this object slowed over several times while descending and descending I could tell it was round when viewed from the bottom and thin when viewed from the side.
A few minutes later another one passed over very quickly, same direction, level flight, disappeared to the NE. I was not able to obtain a witness to this one as my wife had gone inside the house. It was after this I called out Captain _____ and told him I had seen some unusual objects. For several minutes we saw nothing.
Captain _____ went into his house. After a few minutes two more of the objects came over together, they came from about 180Â°, one continued on out of sight to the north rising rapidly but the other turned and came back over. This object then began to ascend and rapidly passed out of sight. As soon as I saw these objects, I called out Captain _____ and we definitely saw these objects. He could not identify them either.
All 4 of these objects appeared to be about the same size; however, one of them appeared to have an antenna (the one of the last two that moved to the north and then returned to ascend). I am sure the objects were not balloons. The weather was clear, no clouds, a check with Base weather indicated the wind was from the west.
