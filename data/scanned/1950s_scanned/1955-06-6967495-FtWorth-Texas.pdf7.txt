The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, featuring a questionnaire with various questions about the sighting of an unidentified object.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.
21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. Approximately 300-400 feet.
22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand (Circle One): d. Nickel
22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22): b. Fairly certain
23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Faded from view - became smaller and smaller until it disappeared.
24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could continue the vision that you now have. Of what type material would you make it to be, and what shape would it have. Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky could give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
The object appeared to be of a flat surface, similar to a mirror or reflecting surface as it glimmered and glinted like a mirror, and more than one object was observed, though larger and smaller versions. It appeared to move without any audible sound or propulsion, but simply floated without any visible means of support.
