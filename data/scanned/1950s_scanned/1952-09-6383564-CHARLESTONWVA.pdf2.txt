1. A pilot report of an unusual nature involving phenomena observed by crew members of a B-29 aircraft on 24 September 1952, south of Charleston, W. Va., was received by Detachment 7, 1st Weather Group, Griffiss Air Force Base, Rome, New York. The number and types of the aircraft and the names and organization of the crew members were not included in the report forwarded to HQ MATS.

2. The report is as follows:

a. Date: 24 September 1952
b. Time: 15:46
c. Location: 35 miles due south of Charleston, West Virginia
d. Type of Aircraft: B-29
e. Incident. Altitude: 23,000 feet
f. Altimeter Setting: 30.26 inches (Hg)
g. Magnetic Heading: 190 knots
h. Remarks: The aircraft was on a track of 350 degrees toward Charleston. The crew members observed a light or lights below the aircraft. The particles were visible from all observation points in the aircraft. The participles were in the form of a bright, white light and appeared to be scattering or bursting. They were pencil-point in width and variable in length from a tiny flash to a scream. These particles were visible for 2 to 3 seconds. There was no sound associated with the phenomenon. Nothing was observed to hit the plane (wing tips, tail, etc.) and the plane continued on its course. The particles appeared to be moving laterally to the course of the aircraft. Scanners could see the particles in the slip-stream and to the rear, but there was no turbulence or disturbance of any kind. There was no change in the white light and radio spectrum. The phenomenon was observed for a distance of 50 miles and lasted approximately 10 to 13 miles from the point of first observation.
