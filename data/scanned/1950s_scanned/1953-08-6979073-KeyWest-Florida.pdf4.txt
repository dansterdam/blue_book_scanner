PAGE: 3 OF 4 PAGES

On 21 July 1953 the witness reported the following:

The observer stated that on 21 July 1953 he was accompanied by his wife and another couple on a picnic at Key West. At approximately 2:30 PM EST, they observed three unusual objects in the sky. The objects were described as round, white, and hazy in appearance. They were located northeast of the observer's position and were moving in a straight line at approximately the same speed. The observer estimated the speed to be around 600 to 800 mph and the altitude to be approximately 20,000 to 25,000 feet.

The objects were observed for approximately 30 to 45 seconds. The observer's wife called his attention to the objects. When he first saw them they were already under observation by the other couple. The objects disappeared from sight going off in a northeasterly direction. The observer stated he did not know the exact distance or height of the objects, as he had no means of determining this. He did not hear any sound associated with the objects.

The observer stated that he is a retired military officer and is familiar with various aircraft. He said the objects were unlike any aircraft he had previously observed. He further stated that they moved at a speed much greater than any known aircraft. In his opinion, the objects were unidentified.

The Air Force investigator stated that the observer appeared to be reliable and that his report was made in good faith. Further, the investigator stated that the observer's description of the objects corresponds generally with other unidentified sightings reported in the Key West area around that time. The investigator did not feel that the observer had misidentified a conventional aircraft.
