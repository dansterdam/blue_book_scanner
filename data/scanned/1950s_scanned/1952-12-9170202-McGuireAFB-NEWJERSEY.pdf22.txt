AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

This document contains the following text:

"I, MAIENANN, WILLIAM V., A02030433, do certify that: 

On 1 December 1952 at approx. 2145, I was on a training mission in an F-94 aircraft flying from McGuire AFB, New Jersey, to Thermal, California. At approx. 2155, while over a point approx. 25 miles west of McGuire AFB, over the Atlantic Ocean, I observed a bright light, similar to that of a bright star, which had been off for some 30 miles west of McGuire AFB. The object was observed for approx. 3 minutes and it remained stationary. It then started moving at a rapid rate of speed, which I estimated to be 1,500 to 2,000 mph, and it made an abrupt turn to the left (south) and continued on in a southerly direction. The object then appeared to blend into the stars and was lost to my observation. During this period, the object seemed to change colors, first from a bright white light to a red-orange to a green color and then back to a bright white light. I checked my instruments and found no malfunctions which could have accounted for what I observed. I am thoroughly familiar with all types of aircraft, both jet and conventional, and I am positive this was not an aircraft of any type known to me. This report is made at the request of my commanding officer and I have been instructed to make it."
