Stirs West Areas

Gus C. Backman, executive secretary of the Salt Lake City Chamber of Commerce, said to was described to him as a "long trail with a light coming through it" He said he heard no explosion or saw any debris falling, though the flash in the sky was pronounced.

Carl H. Becker, assistant foreman of the Salt Lake Municipal Airport, said the object passed over the airport, leaving a trail of smoke, but did not hit the ground. He said it appeared to be a brilliant meteor or burned out rocket heading in a northeasterly direction.
