Call From 3agt Levy ext 6521 or 6529, Grand Forks AFB, N Dakota
regarding observation or appearance of strange object several days ago by observers at Minot, North Dakota. Through exchange of telephone conversations following was obtained:
He is a farmer and saw this object near the Minot. man site I-37. Sighting 50 miles east of Grand Forks AFB. Looked like glass bulbs inside of a ring. The sound was like a tractor back firing. He has made sketches of it. It was as 6pm that he observed this object. This man had reported it to Grand Forks AFB and told them he had reported it to Minot and was worried cause the UFO was near the Minot site. He hadn't thought anything about it at first but then got to thinking it was near the Minot sighting. Sgt Levy said the man had wanted to fill out forms or something of the kind.
Informed Sgt Levy that we would send this man a form 12 to complete. Sgt Levy is going to send us a report of his conversation and how the case got into his hands. He would inform the man that he was going to be sent some forms to fill out and that he was sure this would please him.
