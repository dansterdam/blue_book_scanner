Regarding the Oxnard case, again it raises my personal question - - - did any of the many persons concerned have binoculars or a camera? This always seems to be the case!
The assumption you consulted apparently did not have a good starchard because while it is so that Arcturus was in the eastern sky yet south and altitude was striking, but far in the western skies it would be my opinion that the primary green object at or near zenith which seemed to come to a fair height by 8:30 p.m. still it is always difficult for me to understand, could it possibly cause so much contusion on the part of observers. It is unlikely there is anything more to say, it may have been misunderstood or confused. In this case seven police officers!
The trajectories or trails of the objects sighted certainly matched the diurnal paths of the star vesa and other stars showing some of the observers could ascribe fast motion and "speeding up" to this sighting. Your point is well taken, if these things move rapidly and speeded up, why were they in sight so long!
