                Report of Inquiry

    On the (blank) day (blank), at about (blank) hours, I made 
observation. While standing outdoors, I noticed an object at 
certain height.
    Suddenly, this object made a maneuver in the western skies, 
an (blank) bore in mind (blank).
    The object appeared to be shiny and cylindrical in shape. As 
it moved, it left a visible trail behind it. The trail was 
noticed for an estimated (blank) minutes before fading. 
    I estimate the speed of the object to be in excess of 
(blank) miles per hour at which point it disappeared from sight 
about (blank) degrees to the west of my location.
    After this, there was an unusual silence that ensued the 
disappearance of the object. No further sightings were made 
by myself or any other observer present in the vicinity at that 
time.
    This account was relayed to Project Blue Book for further 
analysis and documentation. Signed,
(blank).
