AIR FORCE MISSILE TEST CENTER

Patrick Air Force Base, Florida

1 Nov 57

Dear Captain Elwood:

This Center received a courtesy copy of Major L. J. Tacker's letter to you dated 25 October 1957, which has reference to reports of unidentified flying objects (UFO's) in Polk County...23 October 1957. It is believed that Polk County is the area referred to as No Type County in Florida.

An investigation has not uncovered any record of the reference made by Major Tacker to this Center. Four of the five sightings checked, maintain blotters and log cards which cover the period. The fifth sighting (A) cannot be definitely identified by the ARDC Staff Report Marshall.

It is regretted that this Center can not be of further assistance in this matter. A study by this office revealed that over 90% of the UFO calls are the result of sightings relating to our own activities (distant aircraft, balloons, weather checks), aircraft and reflection of the moon, planets, and stars on water and many other natural phenomena.

Sincerely yours,

ROBERT SARGENT, Captain, USAF
Assistant Adjutant

Capt. Wallace V. Elwood, USAF
Assistant Adjutant
Air Technical Intelligence Center
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio
