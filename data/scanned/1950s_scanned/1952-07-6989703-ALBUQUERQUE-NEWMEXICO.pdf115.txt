There does not appear to be any photograph or image in this document. The document appears to be a scanned page of handwritten text, which I will proceed to transcribe as follows:

At one stage during this incident (class when a record), the object appeared to show down from a high altitude and hovered over this immediately van. Some lights on it went on. This happened so quickly that I cannot diffic ltly remember all it. It disappeared so quickly that I cannot remember all the details.

I cannot make it diffic late.
