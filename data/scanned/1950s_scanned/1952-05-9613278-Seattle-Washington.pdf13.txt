The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, specifically regarding a presumed meteor that "shook Seattle" on May 19, 1952.

AIR FORCE CHECKING PRESUMED METEOR THAT SHOOK SEATTLE
Not Seen On Radar
Astronomers & the United States Air Force, guardian of the nation's air defenses, have been unable to find any trace of an object that apparently rocked the area in the early hours of Saturday morning, though it was observed violently. Scientists who make a study of meteorites and meteors have been unable to find any trace of impact on the earth's surface at the spot where the object hovered briefly before disappearing. The Air Force has been checking the area thoroughly but has been unable to find any trace of the object.
CHECKING DATA
All available agencies have contributed every scrap of information they have been able to gather on the mysterious incident. Reports from widely scattered areas have been forthcoming, but the object, which was said to have been so brilliantly lighted, has been described vaguely and variously.
REQUEST
It is requested that anyone who might have photos or motion pictures of the object to forward them to his organization at once, for study and analysis.
