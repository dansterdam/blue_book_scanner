The objects observed appeared at the same distance apart all during the observation. 

The objects traveled in a straight line throughout the observation.

The weather was very clear on the night of the sighting with a very slight breeze.

I was probably the second or third person to sight the object and continued to observe it beside me.

I can add nothing else to this statement.

STATEMENT OF MRS. - - - -:

On the night of July 22, 1952, my husband, - - - - and I observed a strange luminous object in the sky over Lavallette, N.J. The object appeared to be at high altitude and traveling at a terrific rate of speed. We observed it for several minutes as it crossed the sky in a northeasterly direction. When we first sighted the object it appeared to be traveling in a straight line. However, after passing the zenith it suddenly changed direction, traveling in a westerly direction for a brief period before disappearing from sight. During the course of the observation, the object changed color from a bright white to a reddish orange glow. We were greatly disturbed and concerned by this incident and could not understand the nature and origin of the observed object.
