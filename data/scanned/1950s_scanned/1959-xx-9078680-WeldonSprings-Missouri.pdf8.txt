SUBJECT UFO SIGHTING

JR: Lewis C. Missourl 

Referring to the UFO which we witnessed 1 you and 2 other gentlemen on 28 JuI, 1957, at which you personally reported to the Air Force but have not received any reply or acknowledgement, we note with regret your disappointment and concern that this sighting has apparently been disregarded.

The United States Air Force appreciates your interest in this matter.
