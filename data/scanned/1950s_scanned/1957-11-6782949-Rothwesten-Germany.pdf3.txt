SUMMARY (Give summary which highlights the salient factors of narrative report. Being narrative test on AF Form 112 Changes may be lightly added for AF forman 121 Last sentences including reason for Summary page)
1. On 14 Nov 57, radar surveillance sightings with ground 
electronic equipment (AN/MPS-11) at the Gungeo's radar station 
(51 degrees 25 minutes, 03 seconds North; 09 degrees, 31 minutes,
55 seconds East) of the 601st ACWRON, Rothwesten, Germany, revealed
three targets of unknown character.
2. All three targets were high speed in nature. The first 
target was initially detected at 1101Z at MG 2315 (22 nautical 
miles southwest of Hersenberg Sovozone Airfield). The second target 
was detected at 1144Z at MG 5015 (8 nautical miles southwest of 
Hersenberg Sovozone Airfield). The third target was detected at 
1755Z at NE 1055 (within West Germany, approximately 10 nautical 
miles southeast of the West German-Czech border).
3. There was no evidence of abnormal electronic interference 
with respect to the target detected at 1101Z. However, an unusual 
amount of interference occurred at the time of the other two 
sightings. Investigations by reliable radar maintenance and intelli-
gence personnel brought forth satisfactory explanations for all 
interference other than the targets being reported.
