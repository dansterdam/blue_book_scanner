STATEMENT OF
A/2C EDWARD C. SMITH
CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR

29 August 1952

I was on duty on the night of 28 August 1952, as a control tower operator, when I was called about 2237 to put GCA in operation, as there was an object overhead which appeared to be moving at a terrific rate of speed. I turned on the GCA and observed the object on the radarscope. It was in an apparent erratic course and was in sight for approximately 2 minutes. I directed the object to be observed through the binoculars. I was using. The object appeared in one place and then in another. It is apparent that it moved at an extremely high rate of speed. Then it began getting dimmer and dimmer until it faded out completely.
The object was of such a nature that it did not reflect light any appreciable amount. It did not resemble any aircraft or meteor I have ever seen. It did not leave a trail of any kind and the only effect produced was a reddish glow around the edges, which faded out completely.
