Dear Sirs,

At approximately 4:15 P.M., February 12, 1959, I glanced to glance out of my laboratory window and noticed a strange object in the sky. This object appeared to be two overhead flying under a cirrostratus type cloud approximately 5,000 feet above the ground. 

The important thing was that the three lines were parallel so I immediately studied it closer to my photograph but found that it was too far away to photograph properly. The inclined photographs should give you an idea of the situation.

This was the second time I have observed this type object. About an hour earlier, the same type of object was observed but did not remain in view as long as the one mentioned above.

I am sure the USAF researcher and will appreciate an explanation of the phenomena.

Sincerely,
