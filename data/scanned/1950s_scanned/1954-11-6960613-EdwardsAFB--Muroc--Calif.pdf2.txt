THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT HAS SINCE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A FLARE THROUGH STUDY OF ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. SEATON'S DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT DOES NOT COINCIDE WITH FLARE CHARACTERISTICS OBSERVED AT THAT TIME.
THE OBJECT DESCRIBED BY SEATON HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED TO DATE. IT IS CATEGORIZED AS UNIDENTIFIED. FURTHER INFORMATION AS TO NATURE OF OBJECT IS DESIRABLE.
CONCLUSION: THE OBJECT DESCRIBED CANNOT BE SATISFACTORILY EXPLAINED AT THIS TIME AND IS CONSIDERED UNIDENTIFIED.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:
ABOUT 18:00 HOURS PACIFIC STANDARD TIME ON 10 NOVEMBER 1954, MR. MAURICE SEATON, CIVILIAN EMPLOYEE OF THE AIR FORCE, REPORTED SEEING AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT IN THE SKY WHILE DRIVING ON HIGHWAY APPROXIMATELY 7 MILES SOUTH OF EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA. 
SEATON STATED THAT HE WAS TRAVELING SOUTH ON HIGHWAY ABOUT 55-60 MPH WHEN HIS ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO A BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE SKY ABOUT 65-70 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON IN THE SE QUADRANT. SEATON DESCRIBED THE OBJECT AS BRIGHT WHITE, CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, AND ABOUT 1/3 TO 1/2 THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE FULL MOON. HE STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE PULSATING OR FLASHING AT A RATE OF ABOUT 2-3 TIMES PER SECOND AND THAT IT REMAINED STATIONARY FOR APPROXIMATELY 3-4 MINUTES.
ACCORDING TO SEATON, THE OBJECT THEN MADE A SHARP TURN TO THE RIGHT, INCREASED IN SPEED, AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND A MOUNTAIN RANGE IN THE SW QUADRANT.
SEATON STATED THAT THE OBJECT WAS IN VIEW FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES AND THAT THERE WAS NO NOISE OR TRAIL ASSOCIATED WITH IT. HE INDICATED THAT THE OBJECT'S MANEUVER WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF A FLARE, BUT THAT ITS BRIGHTNESS AND DURATION WERE NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF A FLARE.
THERE WERE NO OTHER KNOWN WITNESSES TO THIS INCIDENT. THE OFFICIAL RECORDS SHOW THAT THERE WERE NO AIRCRAFT OR GUIDED MISSILES IN THE AREA AT THE TIME. FLARES WERE BEING USED IN NIGHT BOMBING PRACTICE ABOUT 10 MILES NORTH OF EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, BUT ACCORDING TO THE TOWER OPERATOR, NONE WERE FIRED DURING THE PERIOD IN QUESTION.
