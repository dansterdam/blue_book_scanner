CONCLUSIONS:
A. OBSERVATIONS: This investigator did observe some unusual or unexplainable phenomena, but it is impossible to determine positively their nature and the cause. The witness talked to him in such a way that he now believes or alleges he believes this phenomenon occurred as described. However, his allegations are impossible oc investigate conclusively.
10. CASE: This was the only case of the four that did not disclose any discrepancies between the original UFO report. No firm or definite conclusion can be made due to lack of further information and the difficulty of getting additional details from the interview of the witness skipping from the first contact to the landing.
11. CASE: From his obvious susceptibility to suggestion, and description of his sightings "500 feet from the ground", the object is considered an aircraft preparatory to landing, and will be listed in this category.
12. CASE: Apparently an aircraft, but insufficient information.
13. GENERAL: All the individuals associated with the UFOSIG appeared to be people who, although good American citizens, have vivid imaginations and sincerely believe they are making the true discoveries of investigations from this organization.
