MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE
SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Aircraft over Marrakech, Morocco on 8 August 1952

1. Report of subject sighting states that an unidentified target was picked up by an AN/CPS-5 radar set at 1030 GMT on 8 August 1952. The target was simultaneously sighted by an air crew through the telescope and visually through the windshield of the aircraft, was determined to have a speed of 137 miles per hour and an altitude above 30,000 feet, was under observation for 15-20 minutes.

2. It was determined that a USN AF-1 aircraft was over Marrakech at the reported time.

3. The sighting was observed by the three persons who observed the aircraft through the telescope as exhibiting very good agreement and together are considerably similar to the confirmation and mission of the AF-1.

4. Observation is therefore evaluated as an AF-1 with a malfunction in the radar plotter resulting in an error in the speed and altitude determination on the speed of target. Providing the speed and approximate altitude of three times a corrected speed of about 400 miles per hour and an altitude of approximately 20,000 feet.
