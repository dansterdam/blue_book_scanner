Dear Mr. -------,

This is to acknowledge your letter of 6 September 1959 concerning Unidentified Flying Objects you sighted recently on Lake Butte Des Mortes, Wisconsin.

Your letter contained insufficient data to allow a valid conclusion. Therefore, I request you complete the attached Air Force Questionnaire in regard to this sighting and forward the completed paper to the Aerial Phenomena Branch, Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for analysis and evaluation.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
