AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM (Rtnq)                                  REPORT NO. 23JJF08-1-56                                      Part Elght
Flight 2.5, 4602d AISS                                                                                  10       OF       11       PAGES
COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
1. All Six (6) SOURCES had high school educations, and one also had some
mechanical trade school training. They all appeared to be sincere and reliable.
All ware evaluated as belng of average or above average intelligence. Three (3)
were law enforcement officers, and three (3) were GOC observers. Of the latter
group one (1) was a housewife, one (1) was a guided missile design engineer and
the third was a guided missile draftsman. These three (3) people are considered
well qualified, reliable observers because of their GOC and aeronautlcal technical
backgrounds.
2. The object did not possess the qualitles of an aircraft. It was visible from
ten (10) to thirty (30) minutes and no radar return was received. Also, all avail-
able SOURCES regarding aircraft scheduling reported none were in the area at the
specific time of the report with the possible exception of one (1) C-119 reported
landing at Pope ATB at 0501EST Mar 56. That could possibly account for the first
sighting except that there was no radar return. It would not account for the
second sighting, however.
3. The object appeared to have few qualitles possessed by a meteor. The long
duration of sighting and the second appearance seen to rule out this possibllity.
Likewise, it is improbable that It could have been some type of optical phenomena
due to the large number of observations and the various methods of observations
(the naked eye with no obstructions, naked eye with eyeglasses, through 7x50 bin-
oculars, and a combination of the fore mentioned methods through windows). The
fact that it appeared on the second night also helps rule out this posslbillty.
4. The possibllity that the sighting might have been a balloon seems unlikely
since the only two in the immediate vicinity could not have been observed at the
time of the sighting. Also, it is highly improbable that balloons on two separate
occasions would travel the exact same paths through the atmosphere. The possibllity
that weather phenomena caused the observation is slight since the sky was clear and
since it was observed on two separate nights.
5. All qualities associated with stars or planets seem to have been possessed
by the object with the exception of one - its course was not even remotely east
to west, but rather south-southeast to south. All six (6) of the SOURCES agreed
that its course was in this direction. The investigator observed the GOC tower
from which the many observations were made and stated that directionali equipment
was available. Investigator also checked the land marks over which the object
passed and the directions indicated were accurate. Its shape was that of a star
or planet, though a little larger according to some reports. It twinkled, throbbed,
flickereo and pulsated, and it varied in color from yellow or amber to red to green.
These variations in intensity and color are consistent with the sightings of heaven-
ly bodies.
6. Four (4) of the six (6) witnesses stated that they did not have any Idea of
what the object might have been. The two (2) guided Missile engineer stated that
they felt it was definitely not a heavenly bode. They further indicated that they
felt it was a man-made satellite sent aloft. They were quite sincere and emphatic
regarding this conclusion.
