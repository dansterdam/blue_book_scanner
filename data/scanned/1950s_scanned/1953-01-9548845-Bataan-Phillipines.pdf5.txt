STATEMENT OR INCIDENT 
On the evening of 23 January 1953, Lt. Colonel Clarence S. C. Chief of the Intelligence Section, 13th Air Force, Headquarters, O. D. Wheeler Field, Philippine Islands, reported the following:

On the evening of 23 January 1953, a small light was observed off BATAAN COVE, between ABUCAY and MARIVELES, for approximately 1 hour. Four Air Force Officers and one Philippine Island Civil Service employee, who were on a fishing trip, first sighted the light at about 1900 hours and continued to observe it until about 2000 hours. The light was located approximately 5 miles off shore and about 300 feet above the water. It was described as a small white light, approximately 10-12 feet in diameter, and emanating a very bright light. The light moved rapidly at first, then hovered in one position, suddenly increased in size, and then disappeared. It reappeared in another position and repeated the same maneuvers. All witnesses stated that the object did not resemble any known aircraft. They were unable to determine what the object was, but were definite in their opinions that it was not a conventional aircraft.

I have read the foregoing statement consisting of one page and have initialed it. This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Subscribed and sworn to before me this 10th day of February 1953.
