THE PRESS: Are you withholding any information
about these so-called --

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: Are we now?

THE PRESS: Yes. Is anything --.

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: There is one thing that we
have asked that our -- some of our informers have asked -- I
don't like the word "informer" either -- reporters had asked --

THE PRESS: We don’t like that word either.

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: I like the word. Reporter
is all right. But many people are reticent about reporting
these things if their names are mentioned because they are
frequently looked on by others as being publicity seekers or
maybe people will avoid them and go on the other side of the
street for awhile (laughter), so they ask us to not say who
made this report and sometimes information is received that
deals with the credibility of a reporter saying he’s drunk
all the time or he never did do anything but lie. (Laughter).
Well, those things we get are not revealed, but in so far as
the statement of what they saw, when and where they saw it,
the measurements that they took, such as they were, we are not
withholding any of that data.

THE PRESS: How about your interpretation of what
they reported?

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: Well, we’re trying to say
as much as we can on that today and admit that the barrier of
understanding on all of this is not one that we break.

THE PRESS: General, have you ever said flatly that
these are not machines that the United States has made or is 
developing?

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: What was that?

THE PRESS: Have you said this afternoon that these
are not machines or weapons that the United States is developing?

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: I would say that these that
we have been speaking about in this locality are definitely not.
However, many reports that we have received and we‘ve been able
to correlate and put in their place we have been able to do so
