HOKKAIDOISLAND, JAPAN

A single flying craft of unknown serial size was observed on 3 occasions, first sighted at about 4:30 P.M. and listed until about 2:30 P.M. the following day, approximately 21 hours. The object appeared at about 2000 hours and was observed at 2300 hours (local time). As initial sighting observers were unable to detect it with the naked eye and any of common viewing devices. Since the plate resting has been observed, the observation was cloudy for all three observations, due to obscuring the contrast between the object and sky. No color or form of propulsion was likewise unknown. First impression of description that object appeared to be a circular disc-type machine was based on contrary to size and dimension of lights twinkling rapidly during their cycle of rotation. Its body "whose shape can only be assumed to be circular" gave off steady, rainbow-colored beams. These were the colors that gave the object a flickering effect when sighted. This operation was continued through the night, the cycle of rotation being similar to the change in colors often seen in popular makes of juke-boxes. As these colors faded, a solid color, either blue or green, would come into the view indicating a revolution and the body was frequently alternately red and white or yellow and white-green plus the other possible combinations of the 3 colors. Beyond the convenience of the observer, the case was one of estimation as to time and detail and that the record of the observation was made from memory, which in all probability may not be complete nor precisely correct.
