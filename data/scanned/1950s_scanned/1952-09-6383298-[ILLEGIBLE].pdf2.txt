1. The following article appeared in the 15 September 1952 edition of the Hong Kong “South China Morning Post”:

FLYING SAUCERS REPORTED SEEN OVER HONG KONG
Taipei, 15 Sept.

A radio officer, whose hobby is the studying of electronics, said today that he had been able to witness the passage over Hong Kong of 15 “flying saucers.”

The informant, who asked that his name be withheld, added that the flying objects appeared over Hong Kong at 1:45 a.m. on Saturday.

He said that they passed over the Colony toward the southeast in an arciform formation. Their size was three times as big as a star. Light was fluorescent and the altitude could not be determined, but while on their way, the objects passed through a small cloud and light was seen through the cloud.

The informant said that he did not immediately report to the authorities, as he did not wish to be delayed in his trip to Taiwan. However, on his return to Hong Kong next Thursday, he would get in touch with the Royal Observatory there.

This is the first time that reports have been made of flying saucers in Hong Kong . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
