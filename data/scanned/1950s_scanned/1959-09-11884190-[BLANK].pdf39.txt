TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE:

Dear Mr. Kinch:

Your letter, dated 26 July 1959, addressed to Senator Bricber
on the subject of unidentified flying objects has been referred to
this office for reply.

The report referred to in your first question is now-classified.
The Air Force has consistently stated that there is a complete lack
of evidence to substantiate the existence of interplanetary spaceships.
The former reports of the scientific physical evidence referred to in your
second question have not been fully declassified for security reasons. 
However, the classified portion of the panel's final report does not
deal specifically with the nature or the character or intelligence
significance which affect the national security. The releasable
portion of the report which you already have been sent with unidentified
flying object cases.

Also, I can assure you that the Final Report of the Panel does not
recommend that the Air Force relinquish its UFO investigative efforts
and all UFO information to the general public.

Your third question is rather difficult to answer. The United
States does not possess a flying saucer as such. However, as you
mentioned in your letter, many devices which we do possess, such
as weather balloons, jet aircraft and missiles, can be mistaken for
an unidentified flying object under unusual circumstances.
