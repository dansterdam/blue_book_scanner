The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically the file "1952-09-6383354-ELPASO-TEXAS.pdf5.txt".

The text on the page is as follows:

The class of time in seconds, from the instance of first vision to the departure is 20 seconds. At the time it would be impossible for any person to have observed the objects or instruments as instruments of any kind were not visible, any description or identification of such would be guess work and not a true statement of facts.
The celestial factors for the period were known, and these factors are considered necessary to a complete understanding of the case.

In regard to "this display of lights and do's" expressed, it is the writer's belief and opinion that if the celestial display was visible, many of the statements whether it is so in order of the exhibit or the nature of the display as described, may not be in keeping with the actual facts. There may be an inclination to exaggerate in describing phenomen a which are not well understood by the public. The writer reserves judgment whether it is so or not. The public will undoubtedly draw their own conclusions, and the writer makes no attempt to influence their judgment or opinions.

As the various army and navy factors are constant, it is constant that the time should show to many observers. Apparently this seems to be the case.

In closing: The writer will state no suggestions as to the why's or to theorize about this observed display, but will simply reiterate that in the interest of scientific approach to the problem, and because of the sincerity appreciation that this little contribution and attention of efforts can be mutually to our advantage.

This is respectfully submitted to those of greater know-how and with the sincere appreciation that this little contribution and observation of efforts can be mutually to our advantage.
