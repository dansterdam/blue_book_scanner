COMMENT:
1. The object sighted on the morning of 29 October 1958, at Gatherburg and Washington, D.C. was also seen and reported by witnesses as far west as Pittsburgh. The description indicates a strange object high in the sky over Washington.
2. The description of the object and possible sound is typical of a meteor or celestial body. The observatory at Gatherburg indicated the object was in the atmosphere and breaking up. The conclusion was that it was a meteor. The description given by some witnesses that there was more than one object indicates burnout of the meteor.
3. The ATIC conclusion is that all witnesses saw the same meteor, and that small differences in the description of the seen be attributed to the short time of observation and the approach or burnout.
