NEW EVIDENCE ON IGY PHOTOS

On the 16th of January, 1958, Mr. Admiral Barana, civilian and guest of the Brazilian Navy, on board the Brazilian Training Ship, Almirante Saldanha, photographed an object which flew in from the ocean, circled above the ship, and then flew out to sea. He obtained 4 photos. Barana was not the only observer, and various Brazilian newspapers at the time stated that "elements" (members) of the crew of the Almirante Saldanha had also seen the Saturn-shaped object. 
The incident was investigated, and even produced sight ings which preceded the event of the 16th. He mentioned in the test of his letter to APRO (dated March and May 1960) the existence of a secret Navy Report which dealt with the incident.
In October, 1954, a heavy manila envelope arrived at APRO Headquarters. It contained a complete set (4) of photographs of the "Trindade object" as well as correspondence between various Brazilian Navy officers concerning the incident and the photographs and letters and the Navy report itself, was a letter to Mrs. Lorenzen from the Brazilian Navy Intelligence Officer. In the letter he asked Mrs. Lorenzen to use the report, photographs and other material in any way possible in order to clear up the confusion and misrepresentations concerning the IGY photographs. He said he had read her book and complimented her on her handling of the IGY case. He also asked her to do everything possible to protect his identity, and this has been accomplished. Another request was that a copy be made by APRO of the contents and sent to that organization, for a set of the photos were being sent to that organization. (Always wary of such things, Mrs. Lorenzen checked APRO's files for authentic confirmation of the reports, and she found them to be authentic. She also contacted Dick Hall of NICAP and asked for IGY Evidence, page 3)
