At approximately 3 o'clock in the morning, the pilots
of an airliner from New York to Jacksonville, Fla. passed up and
over sharply to avoid colliding with a "brilliant greenish-
white object" that suddenly appeared in his path.  The
pilot and co-pilot described it as resembling a huge
glaring spotlight.  A number of passengers were injured
during the violent maneuver and requested hospitalization.
The fact that two other airliners approximately 175
miles away observed the object at the same time ruled out
aircraft and missiles.  This was later confirmed by all
military and civil agencies.  From a description given
by the crew and passengers who happened to see the object,
and from interrogation of the CAA and the Navy, the Center
concluded that the object was a seldom seen form of meteor,
a bolide, commonly referred to as a "fireball." The analysis
was independently reviewed and concurred with by a well-
known astrophysicist now with the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory.
