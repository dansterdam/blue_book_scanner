ACCOUNT OF HER HUSBAND MORBID JEALOUSY, SO MR. BENEDICT GONZALVES UNDERTAKES TO MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THERE WOULD BE NO DANGER OF HER HUSBAND ARRIVING SUDDENLY. (INTERVIEW) TO MAKE CONCLUSIONS FROM OBSERVATION.

Q: IT SEEMS THAT HE DESCRIBED THE MATERIAL AS A "SILVERY RAIN". HOW
A: (SMILING) I GUESS I AM GUILTY OF THAT. WHEN I SAW THE MATERIAL IT LOOKED LIKE SILVERY RAIN. WHAT I DESCRIBED WAS JUST WHAT I SAW.
Q: WHAT DO YOU THINK? (DOESN'T PRINT WHAT I SAID ABOUT MY OPINION). WAS IT A HOAX?
A: POSITIVELY NO. WHAT GIVES IT SUBSTANCE IS THAT THE ANALYSIS SHOWED SOMETHING UNUSUAL ABOUT THE MATERIAL. IT WAS NOT ORDINARY. WHEN I SAW THE SAMPLE, IT WAS JUST LIKE SILVERY RAIN AS I DESCRIBED.
Q: WHAT ABOUT THE MATERIAL CONTRACTING?
A: (ANOTHER VOICE) WELL, I WOULD NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT DETAIL.
Q: WHY DID IT CONTRACT SO UNEXPECTEDLY?
A: I THOUGHT THE THING HAD DIMINISHED IN SIZE AND I ASKED, "WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?". THEN WE DELIVERED THE MATERIAL TO THE AIR FORCE. THEN WE DELIVERED THE MATERIAL TO THE AIR FORCE. JAMES SAID IT CONTRACTED SO IT WAS A FACTOR.
Q: THEN IT WAS JUST AN IMPRESSION?
A: OBVIOUSLY THE THING WAS CONTRACTING, BUT I WOULD NOT ASSIGN ANY SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO THAT.
Q: WHO THEN SAW THE ROTATING SPRAY ALSO?
A: UNFORTUNATELY, THE ARTICLE DOES NOT IDENTIFY OR NAME ANY INDIVIDUALS.
Q: YEAH, BECKY. MR. GONZALVES INSISTED.
A: I KNOW HOW MUCH IS CLAIMED SOMETIMES WHAT...  THE MATERIAL CAME FROM ANOTHER PLANET OR SPACE, BUT.
A: NO- HE SAID HE WAS AMAZED BECAUSE EVEN WHEN THE MATERIAL WAS PRODUCED IN HIS LABORATORY, THERE WAS STILL A ROTATING SPRAY WHICH WERE NOT PRESENT WHEN THE SAMPLE WAS EXAMINED WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY SEEN.
Q: ACTUALLY, COULD IT BE THAT THE ROTATING SPRAY WAS SOMETHING FROM THE SAMPLE ITSELF?
A: HE DECLINED TO THE PRESS' BOYS THAT ASSUMING THAT IS FACTOR OR ATTRACTIVE CAN BE MISLEADING BECAUSE PHOTOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS WOULD BE NECESSARY TO ASCERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS. SOME OF THE MATERIAL THAT HE OBTAINED FROM THE AIR FORCE SHOWED SOME UNUSUAL PROPERTIES, BUT HE NEVER SAID THAT THE THING FELL FROM ANOTHER PLANET. HE SAID THAT IT COULD BE FROM ANOTHER PLANET OR ORIGINATED IN SOME OTHER UNUSUAL SOURCE.
Q: DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SAMPLE BEING SENT TO THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE?
A: I DON'T THINK SO.
