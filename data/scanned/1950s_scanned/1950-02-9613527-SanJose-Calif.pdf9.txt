There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows an excerpt from what seems to be a Project Blue Book document, describing an incident involving an object that "looked like an ice cream cone" with a "vapor trail" that was observed over the San Francisco area on February 8, 1950.

The text in the document is as follows:

"Flying Cone With Vapor Trail Hunted
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 8 (UP)
So now it's a "flying ice cream cone." The Air Force is checking up on it.
Six observers, including Lt. Comdr. J. L. Kraker of the Air Station Naval Air Media, reported seeing a giant, glowing object passing over the station yesterday. The object, which was passed along to the Western Air Defense zone intelligence office in Hamilton Field, which made it public today.
The observers said the object looked like an ice cream cone and was trailing a vapor stream about 5000 feet. It was traveling at a speed estimated from 75 to 95 miles an hour. They described it as tilting slightly on its side and headed southwest after passing south.
Authorities at the air station said no maneuverable balloons were up yesterday. A spokesman said the Air Force is checking but thus far found nothing."
