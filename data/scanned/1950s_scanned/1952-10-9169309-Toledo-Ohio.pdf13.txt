Dear Lieutenant Storm,

In reply to your letter of July 29th 1955 wherein you gave us a brief outline of the sighting of the objects that we had seen you.

My son was just home recently and he is again discussing this matter and he insists that the objects appeared to stand still at times, which still leaves some doubt in my mind as to whether the objects were the conventional type air craft.

Enclosed you will find the one slide that you requested for your files.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature redacted]
