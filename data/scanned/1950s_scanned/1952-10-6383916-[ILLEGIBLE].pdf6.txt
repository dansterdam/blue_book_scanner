The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a newspaper clipping or document describing a sighting of a "Lighted Craft" by an astronomy class at the Central Ohio observatory. The text describes the craft as a "strange object" that was observed soaring through the sky, moving rapidly back and forth. Several students and the observatory director observed the craft, which they described as having a "angular speed" and moving in a "southwesterly" direction. The document states that the craft could not be identified conclusively, but the observers estimated its speed to be around 10 lights per minute.

A STRANGE OBJECT
Lighted Craft Sighted
By Astronomy Class
BY PAUL GAPP
A strange object bearing eight to 10 lights was observed soaring through the Central Ohio skies at Perkins Observatory Monday night.
Several astronomy students saw the phenomenon. They were taking part in a weekly obser
vation period.
Allen I. Hynek, assistant dean of the
Ohio State University Graduate School, said the students were carefully instructed and knew what to look for. However, he added, the object could not be conclusively identified.
The students at the observatory first noticed the lights about 7:50 p.m., said Hynek. He added that the craft was visible for several minutes, its lights blinking on and off at an "angular speed" of several degrees a minute.
Hynek said the students calculate the miles-per-hour speed, since the distance of the craft could not be determined. This is not readily done, he said, because the true distance was not known.
The object was not trailed in the observatory cameras, which were in use at the time, closely watched for several minutes.
