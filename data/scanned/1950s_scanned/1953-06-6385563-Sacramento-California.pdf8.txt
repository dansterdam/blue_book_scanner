There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document labeled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT" from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document reads:

"The object was approximately 230 yards in length. It was an object in the sky. It seemed to be of cigar shape and was very bright in color. I saw the object at approximately 2230 hours. It was approximately 230 yards in length. It seemed to be of cigar shape and very bright in color. The object was in sight for approximately 2 minutes. After reaching an altitude of about 500 yards, the object faded gradually and disappeared."

The document is signed "Arthur G. Godfrey, Captain, USAF" at the bottom.

The document is also marked as "UNCLASSIFIED" and has a note at the bottom indicating it was "DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVAL DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS".
