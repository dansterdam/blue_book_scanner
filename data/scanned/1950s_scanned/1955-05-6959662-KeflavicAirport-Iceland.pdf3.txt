AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
6-3-55
At about 1930 hrs. on 5 Mar 55, I was notified and asked to investigate an object sighted in the sky. Upon arriving at the site in Keflavik Airport, Iceland, the object had disappeared from view but was reported to have been observed flying at an altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet and was about the size of a small aircraft. The object apparently moved in a westerly direction and disappeared behind some intervening terrain.
The object was observed through binoculars by an officer of the Operations Section and witnesses stated that the object was oval in shape and silver in color. The witnesses also stated that the object appeared to be oscillating or pulsating and was much brighter than the surrounding sky.
The following information is submitted in accordance with AFR 200-2:
1. Description of the object:
a. Round in shape
b. About the size of a small plane
c. Appeared short transient white
d. Approximately 10
e. All information gathered from the witness available at this location.
