AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
1. The following group interrogation was made by Captain Davis concerning a sighting of unidentified objects:
a. Number 1 Crewman: While flying an F-51 at approximately 150 miles per hour between 5:10 and 5:20 pm on 8 August at an altitude of 16,000 feet, he observed a gray obj ect, about 35-40 feet in diameter, traveling at a very high rate of speed. It was flying in the same general direction as the F-51 but at a much higher altitude. The obj ect appeared to be spinning or revolving as it flew. It remained in sight for approximately 10-15 seconds before disappearing from view.
b. Radar Operator: Observed the same object on his scope at approximately the same time and location as the pilot. The object was tracked for several minutes and at one point reached a speed of 1,700 miles per hour.
c. Instrument Technician-Pilot: While flying an F-86 at approximately 30,000 feet between 5:15 and 5:30 pm on 8 August, he observed a white, round obj ect, approximately 30 feet in diameter, moving at a fantastic rate of speed. The obj ect appeared to be glowing and was observed for approximately 20 seconds before disappearing from view.
2. All three crewmembers stated that the ob j ect(s) appeared to be under intelligent control.
3. It is believed that this sighting may be connected with an incident reported at the same time by a pilot of the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing in Korea.
4. Air Intelligence considers this sighting to be of extreme importance since it is verified by separate observers and is supported by radar tracking.
