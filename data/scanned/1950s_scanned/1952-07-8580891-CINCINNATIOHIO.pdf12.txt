    clearly                        solid body

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have
    caused it? WAS NOT A METEOR, BOLIDE OR FIREBALL. 
Same evening witnessed 5 meteors in vicinity... very distinguishable from object described. Too fast for any known jet craft, too fast for balloon. Apparently artificial and controlled; especially in light & behavioursm observed by two other.
