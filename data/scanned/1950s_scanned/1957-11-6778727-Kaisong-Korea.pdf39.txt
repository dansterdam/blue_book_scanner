AIR INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION RECORD
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT NUMBER: 28-57
DATE: 12 Dec 57
SUBJECT: SIGHTINGS OF AIR VEHICLES, INTELLIGENCE DIVISION
VALIDITY OF INFORMATION: RELIABLE
FULFILLMENT OF REQUIREMENT: PARTIAL
THE PRIME FACTOR (I.E. APPROXIMATELY 50 WITNESSES, ALL MILITARY OBSERVERS) THAT WOULD GENERALLY PROVIDE AN UNQUESTIONABLE RELIABILITY OF INFORMATION, ALSO INDICATES THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO PROPERLY ANALYZE AND EVALUATE THIS REPORT. FOR EXAMPLE:
1. DESCRIPTIVE OF ESSENTIAL DATA, BUT WITH OCCASIONAL CONFLICTING STATEMENTS OF THE UNIT, TIME, DATE, OR EXACT LOCATION, WHICH REQUIRE 20 MINUTES CORRELATION AND VERIFICATION.
2. COUPLED WITH THE ABOVE, IS THE INABILITY TO CONDUCT AN "ON THE SPOT" INVESTIGATION, FOLLOW-UP OF SURVEYS IN THE AREA OF THE UFO SIGHTING AND PROBABLE ORIGIN.
3. HOWEVER, THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY DATA DERIVED FROM DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE AGGREGATE SIGHTINGS ARE CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT TO THE CONCLUSION GIVEN:
A. HIGHLY IMPROBABLE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF BALLOON TYPES AS THE OBSERVED PHENOMENA BASED ON THE UNUSUAL MANEUVER CHARACTERISTICS (FOR GENERAL FLIGHT TYPES) WOULD OCCUR AT ALTITUDES BETWEEN 50,000 TO 120,000 FEET. THE LUMINOSITY OF THE FLIGHT PATH WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 10 TIMES BRIGHTER THAN THE FULL MOON.
B. APPARENTLY NOT A FIREBALL OR A METEORITE. CONSISTING OF NUMEROUS AND SIMULTANEOUS SIGHTINGS AT THE OBJECT PASSES OUT THESE BODIES, AS WELL AS HIGH-VELOCITY MANEUVER CAPABILITIES AND ALTITUDE CAPABILITIES. IT DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN OBJECT HAVING CONTROL OR NAVIGATION.
C. OBJECT APPARENTLY WAS NOT A PISTOL FLARE OR A JET AIRCRAFT AFTERBURNER, MILITARY OBSERVERS WHO STOOD CLOSEST AT THE UFO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE FORMER.
