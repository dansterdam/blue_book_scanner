UFO PROGRAM

A brief history of the Unidentified Flying Object program would, I think, help you to understand some of its problems and determine its status.

2. The program started in 1947 when on 27 June of that year a private civilian flyer named Kenneth Arnold sighted what looked to him like several disc shaped objects near Mt. Rainier in the state of Washington. He described them as "flying saucers", a term that was forceably and with much sensationalism brought to the public's attention by the press. As a result, the Air Force was given the responsibility of investigating and analyzing such phenomena. This project was called "Project SIGN".

3. From this date, June 1947, to February 1949 when the name of the program was changed to "Project GRUDGE", approximately 375 UFO reports were collected and analyzed. In August 1949, a report on the results was submitted to the authorities. The proportion of sightings which could not be explained, in other words "unknowns", for this period was approximately 20%. It was concluded that these unknowns were due primarily to:

Hearing they are real - convincing reality
Committee of competent scientists to control analysis
Recommendations to the President and the Congress that scientifically trained personnel be assigned to the program
