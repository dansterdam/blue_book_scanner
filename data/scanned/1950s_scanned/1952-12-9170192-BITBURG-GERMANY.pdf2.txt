Bitburg, Germany
6 December 1952

I. Description of Incident
The co-pilot of a London-to-Frankfurt commercial flight sighted a fast moving object for about 15 seconds. The unknown phenomenon crossed his aircraft's path in a forward direction. Time of sighting was 1500. The object was bright at its core.

II. Discussion of Incident
This is a rather incomplete report. A check was made with the Frankfurt flight service center which revealed this no aircraft were in the vicinity. These factors enter into the evaluation of this report: 1) The object arched downward and had a tail. 2) It was seen for 1 to 5 seconds. These points are characteristic of a meteor.

III. Conclusion
Probably a meteor.
