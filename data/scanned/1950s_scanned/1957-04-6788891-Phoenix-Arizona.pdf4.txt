Dear Mr. Drucker:

Your letter to Secretary Douglas has been referred to this office for action.

There is no evidence of any Air Force involvement in the frontier air incidents of 31 March. No missiles were fired at that date. Obviously, speculation that a stray missile was involved is inconsistent with information concerning the incident which should come from that organization.

The Air Force has no desire to restrict unrestrialized information on our missile program. The two recent events referred to by Air Force when were missiles sighted control indicate this. We have always operated under the assumption that security issues involved civilian rather than military control.

Recent instructions to field commanders were designed to hasten the flow of information, rather than retard it.

Let me assure you that the Air Force will continue to operate its information policies in an open and above-board manner, consistent with national security.

Sincerely,

ARNO H. LUEHMAN
Brigadier General, USAF
Director of Information Services
