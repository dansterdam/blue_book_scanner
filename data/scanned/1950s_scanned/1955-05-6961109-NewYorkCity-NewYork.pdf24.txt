REPORT CASE NO. 6961109
NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK
MAY 6, 1955

(TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT)
The witness was a 27-year-old male who was employed as an electrician. At approximately 8:00 PM on May 6, 1955, the witness was on his way home from work in New York City. As he was walking down the street, he observed an unusual object in the sky that caught his attention.

The object appeared to be circular in shape and was hovering in the air approximately 500 feet above the ground. The object was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter and was a bright, metallic color. The witness observed the object for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

The witness immediately reported the incident to the local police department. An investigation was conducted, but no further evidence or witnesses were found. The case was subsequently forwarded to Project Blue Book for further evaluation.
