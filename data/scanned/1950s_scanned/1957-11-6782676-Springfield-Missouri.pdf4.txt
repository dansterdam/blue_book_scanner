Dear Sir,

Your letter of July 5, 1954 has been received and the contents careuily noted. 
Flying saucers do not have to write to you about an incident that has puzzled us since Victoria Kr May 11, 1954 -- 7:30 
P.M. when my wife and myself noticed a strange speeding luminous object in the Springfield mo. area. The object was heading northeast at a very high rate of speed, and leaving a trail of light behind it. The incident lasted approximately 30 seconds. I would like to come and talk to you about this incident if you have the time. Let me know.
