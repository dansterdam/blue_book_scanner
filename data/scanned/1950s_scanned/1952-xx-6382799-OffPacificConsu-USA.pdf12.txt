Air Intelligence Information Report
(UNGL) Report of Unusual Aerial Phenomena
31 December 1952
JOSEPH A. WOODS, Ist Lt Col USAF, Asst ADO
Prof. G. B. Sias

1. On 28 August 1952 an unusual aerial phenomenon was witnessed by Prof. G. B. Sias at Sassari, Sardinia.
2. Prof. G. B. Sias was interviewed by this officer and he appeared to be an intelligent and experienced observer. He stated that either (1) The United States has made scientific strides unknown to the rest of the world and this particular phenomenon was one of them, or (2) The phenomenon was of extraterrestrial origin. Prof. Sias appeared to be a very intense individual and while not actually convinced of the existence of what he thought he saw, he was obviously disturbed by the professor of what he thought he saw.
