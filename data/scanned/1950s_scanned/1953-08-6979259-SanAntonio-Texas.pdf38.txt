METEOR
The Hydrographic Office is cooperating with astronomers who are studying meteors. Mariners reporting their observations of these bodies are greatly assisting in their studies. It is desired to have the observations as complete as possible, not only in reporting visual observations, but also by hearing of the time when they disappeared and any sound or explosion that may have accompanied them.
Complete observations on long-enduring trains and their direction of drift are of especial importance, as they determine wind direction in the upper air.

This green diffused glow on the superstructure of the ship, lasting for about 1 second. This green light was reflected from the sea. The body, traveling extremely fast, coursed parallel to the surface of the sea and disappeared into the clouds emitting a stream of sparks.)
