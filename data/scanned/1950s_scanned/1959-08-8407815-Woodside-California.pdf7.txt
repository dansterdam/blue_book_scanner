Dear Sir:

In our letter to you of September 16, 1959, we requested some information regarding an object identified by a Captain Dale Trombley as a high altitude observation aircraft over the Greater Pittsburgh Airport on September 16, 1959, accompanied by caption. 

We would appreciate it if you would give us the official designation of the instrumentation, make no, etc. and if possible, the name of the manufacturer and some data as to the instrument's function and capabilities.

Thank you for whatever assistance you may be able to provide.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature redacted]
