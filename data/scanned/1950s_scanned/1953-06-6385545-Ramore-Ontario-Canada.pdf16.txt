212TH AIR-CRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SQUADRON
RAMORE, ONTARIO, CANADA

1 July 1953

CERTIFICATE

At about 1115 f.w., on Tuesday, 30 June 1953, in response to calls from some of my men, I sighted what I believed was a "flying saucer".

The object was elliptical in shape. There seemed to be a dull red glow surrounding the object which was between the object and myself. The object was in a horizontal plane, parallel to the earth's surface. The size of the object exceeded slightly the size of a coin held at arm's length.

As the object moved, it seemed to oscillate or flutter, but I could account for this illusion.

As the object travelled in a course that was seemingly due east, I continued to observe it for accuracy. It moved towards the south and then seemed to disappear quite suddenly.
