DATE OF REPORT 30 July 1965

SUBJECT: ANALYSIS OF UNIDENTIFIED PHENOMENA
LOCATION: PHOENIX, ARIZONA USA - SWITZERLAND
DATE AUGUST 1958 - JULY 1959

PHOTOGRAPHY
AF____ IR____ QUALITY____

Attached 2-35mm Color Slides and copies thereof

1. PURPOSE: This report is in answer to Work Order Number 65-ul from 7/Stg TDEAT/FUO, for an analysis of the attached two color slides and two black and white photo reproductions thereof.

2. ANALYSIS: The color slide of Highway 69, vicinity of Phoenix, Arizona is a copy probably from a picture in a magazine. It bears a registration symbol in the upper right hand corner of a type used by professional photographers. The slide depicts the phenomena of a desert sunset and containing little more than colorful and picturesque cloud formations. At the approximate midpoint of the slide is an orange, funnel-like mass which is probably a wind patten trailing a plume of sand/earth which has been lifted from the desert floor. A single, diagonal line immediately below this mass is probably due to poor photo processing.

The second slide, taken in Switzerland, is also a copy, although in this case the original source cannot be identified. The photograph is a low oblique possibly aerial in format and shows a view of the typical mountainous terrain of Switzerland. The definition and color rendition of the slide are not entirely fair, with the upper portion of the photograph is an oblong-appearing translucent streak which is probably due to reflection. From possibly a portion of the aircraft's surface from which the photography was taken.

b. No items of significance were observed on either slide.
