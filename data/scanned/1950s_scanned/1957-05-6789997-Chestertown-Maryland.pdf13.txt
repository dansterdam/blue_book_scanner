We were driving home from dinner at Priet Cote Lodge on the Chesapeake Bay, feeling high-spirited and happy, when from somewhere a saucer-like disc lightened color suddenly it raised near and with a speed appeared as boardless light orangey that over the trees with a red jelly at each end of the oval. It circled near as near that would approach than find that it was quite dark and we judged the heights to be over "hundreds feet" working around 2 miles away. We discussed to fail that there were no other reflective or readable car on a mean of lights. Was driven down a dirt road to key and get elese that it only resulted in having the lights get lost amongst the trees. The cords still in chase returned the car most of the leg we could....Then suddenly...it, there was no seems that turned apt to a flaw in driving on roads. We walked up road as we turned around the lights simply went out. We watched for their return....And there were none. These lighters were with lights like huge star-carrying in an arched pattern, almost 12 or 14, and two red lights on either end. It seemed to us that a deffo ufo(s) on the left(and) One definitely learned many fromward. The others were just lights.
