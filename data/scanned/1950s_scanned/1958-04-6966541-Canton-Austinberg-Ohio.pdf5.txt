UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SUMMARY
SUMMARY AND EXHIBIT SHEET

DATE OF INCIDENT: 7 April 1958
LOCATION OF INCIDENT: Gas pumps at an Oil Ststion,Canton,Austinburg,Ohio
TIME: 0045 Z (GMT)

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT: Two men, 66 and 30 years old, reported seeing a rectangular-shaped object, bright white in color, that hovered over the gas pumps for several minutes. The object was observed to be about 25 feet long and 10 feet high. It made no sound and did not move until it suddenly shot upwards at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The witnesses stated the object was the size of a "small house trailer" and was observed at a distance of about 150 yards.

INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS: The witnesses were interviewed separately and their accounts were consistent. Statements were obtained from the witnesses and the report was forwarded to Project Blue Book.

PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None.

FINAL ATIC EVALUATION: Astronomical (Possibly a Satellite). Although several witnesses observed the object, the description indicates it was probably a satellite or some other natural phenomenon and did not represent an actual "flying saucer."
