Melbourne
17th January, 1954

UNCLASSIFIED

I wish to bring to your notice the sighting of an object, which could be described as a "flying saucer". Although our association was harmless, the sighting was disturbing, and if known to the public it could cause panic and criticism. My company is a very respectable one, and I feel it my duty to report the matter fully, and to ensure that the lady's identity is not associated with me. 

As a result of this sighting our name will undoubtedly become associated with the topic. Also, in working to your wish for an investigation, I feel that this could be regarded as derogatory to the standing of my company. Therefore, I trust it will be treated with discretion, and that an association with me will not be publicized.

Both me, and my companions, were without binoculars, and therefore the times mentioned can only be approximate. The sighting occurred on Friday last, the 15th. inst., and we were in a car parked.
