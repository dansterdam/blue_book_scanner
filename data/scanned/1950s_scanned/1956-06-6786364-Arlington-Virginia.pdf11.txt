The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved horizon line with an object positioned above it. The observer is instructed to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when first seen, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when last seen.

The second sketch shows two larger sketches. The one on the left depicts a road or path leading to a town or city in the distance. The one on the right shows a curved horizon with mountains or hills in the background.
