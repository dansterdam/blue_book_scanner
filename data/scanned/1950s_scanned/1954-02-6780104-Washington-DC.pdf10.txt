MACON, GEORGIA 
INCIDENT
7 - 8 May 1957

From the testimony of the observers, and general landmarks in the photographs, the direction, bearings and elevations of the objects were determined. It was established that the sightings were observed in the direction of a U.S. Army Proving Ground area a few miles away. Further investigations definitely confirmed that between the 6th and 12th of the month, large scale and operations were taking place in the proving-ground area, as part of a joint-defense problem.

A considerable amount of artillery, mortar and anti-aircraft, rocket fire, tracers, and flares, including dropping of parachute types, filled the sky during this period. Aircraft participated. A crowd, reported as 4000 people, witnessed the exercises from within the Army grounds.
