The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" and "B" labeled on it, and a diagram with a central "C" point labeled "MAXIMUM ELEVATION". The second sketch shows a larger view with a person standing in the foreground and a curved horizon line above them. There is also a smaller inset sketch showing an object with the text "OBJECT SWPT OUT APPROXIMATELY 45° IN AZIMUTH".

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
