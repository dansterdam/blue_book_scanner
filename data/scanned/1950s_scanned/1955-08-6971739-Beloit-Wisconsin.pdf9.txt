FLIGHT 2-A 4602D AISS AISS 2-A-UFOB-1-55 PART ONE OF 7 PAGES

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: 
1. As the message, D/USDC, 2334, from the 775th A& G W Sq., Williams AFB, Arizona, indicates, the sighting of the Unidentified Flying Object, as reported by the pilot of the F-86 aircraft, is rather confusing and results in the investigator initially being at odds with the Chief of Police in Beloit. However, when approached, the Chief of Police stated that he knew nothing about the sighting. 

2. In regard to the Beloit sighting, in accordance with the way we studies astronomical and the many times of object sightings, and in accordance with Mr. Hynek's experience and information about the mirage, it is logical to consider that the phenomena may have been a mirage.

3. In view of the weather conditions on the morning of 6 August (thin scattered clouds at 30,000 feet) and the facts that pilot flights were participating in early morning flights at the time of the sighting, plus the fact that Mr. Hillner's observations indicated a jet type aircraft plus its reflections in the clouds, it is considered that the sighting may have been a jet type aircraft plus its reflections in the clouds.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER: 
1. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the Beloit, Wisconsin sighting was generated by astronomical activity, i.e., the annual August meteor shower.

2. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sighting by Mr. Hillner in Beloit was possibly caused by jet aircraft known to be operating in the vicinity.
