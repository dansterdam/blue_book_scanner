The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

As requested, I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

3. S/A Springer will be contacted at 0800 Monday morning. Orders have been cut and will be processed first thing Monday morning. If the OSI report contains anything that indicates further investigation is desired (i.e., not a hoax), it is requested will contact the source and have a report by Monday night or early Tuesday morning at the latest.
