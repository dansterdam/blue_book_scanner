1. Enclosed herewith is a letter from Colonial Airlines, Inc., 8 September 1955, desiring information on a UFOB sighted by personnel of their organization.

2. Investigation by Detachment 3, 4602d AISS, indicated that this sighting was probably generated by a fireball explosion in the atmosphere for the following reasons:

a. The object was seen by Flight 112, Colonial Airlines, Inc., fifty miles north of the location of the sighting as reported by Colonial Airlines, Inc.
b. The object was seen by two observers on the ground, giving an identical description of the object, forty miles south southeast of Flight 112.
c. The duration of the sighting, agreed upon by all observers, was three to five seconds, substantiating the astronomical hypothesis.
d. It is highly improbable that any object other than an astronomical phenomena could be observed at night by observers located approximately one hundred miles apart.

3. In accordance with paragraph 9, AFR 200-2, 12 August 1954, release of the above hypotheses to Colonial Airlines, Inc. by this organization is prohibited. Request that appropriate action be taken by your organization.
