1956-11-7073437-ElToro-California
Date and Time of Observation: 7 Nov 1956 2050 
Location: El Toro, California
Observation Description: Three observers stationed at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station observed several unidentified objects on the radar scope over a two-hour period. The objects were described as bright, targets which moved erraticly across the scope until they disappeared from view. There was no visual confirmation of the targets.
The radar return pattern appeared similar to that of aircraft, but the intermittent and erratic nature of the blips on the scope did not correlate with the expected movements of aircraft in the area. The targets were observed for approximately two hours, during which time they maneuvered across the scope in a seemingly random pattern. 
Evaluations and Conclusions: The radar crew was unable to identify the nature of the targets. The case was considered unidentified due to the lack of visual confirmation and the unusual nature of the radar returns.
