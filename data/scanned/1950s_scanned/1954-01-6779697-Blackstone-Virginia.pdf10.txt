On 29 January 1954, Lt Colonel SCOVILL received a telephone report from the OSI Detachment Commander, Richmond, Virginia, of a sighting of an unidentified object in the sky in the vicinity of Blackstone, Virginia.

Stuart T. Willetts, Blackstone, Virginia, was interviewed at Blackstone, Virginia. Mr. Willetts, a civilian, stated that on 29 January 1954, he had observed an unusual object in the sky which he was unable to identify. He had called the local Air Force Base to report the sighting. Mr. Willetts stated that he had been discharged as a T/Sgt from the Air Force in 1943, and that he had done Air Force duty for two years. He reported that the object was visible for about 10-15 minutes and stated that it was a different color than aircraft he had previously seen. The object continued on a straight course and disappeared.
