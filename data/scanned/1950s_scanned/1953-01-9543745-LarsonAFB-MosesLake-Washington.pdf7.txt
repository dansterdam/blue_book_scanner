On 3 January 1953 the sighting of an unidentified flying object was reported. The object was observed by several military personnel stationed at the Moses Lake Air Force Base in Washington. The object was observed for approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes and was traveling at high speeds, making sudden stops, and changing direction at very short intervals. 

Descriptions of the object were varied, ranging from circular, rectangular, to cylindrical in shape. The object was estimated to be approximately 30 to 50 feet in length and 10 to 15 feet in width. The color was reported to be silver or metallic in appearance.

The majority of the observers were in the immediate vicinity on the base, but a small town 12 miles southwest of the base also had observers. All observations were essentially the same - the object was observed at various altitudes, ranging from 2,000 to 40,000 feet, and was sometimes obscured by clouds.

The following weather conditions were observed in the vicinity:
CHICAGO, ILL: Winds - 2,000' 27 knots, 5,000' 33 knots, 10,000' 360Â°, 23 knots
YAKIMA, WASH: 6,000' 21 knots
TACOMA, WASH: 6,000' 33 knots

There was no reported air traffic in the vicinity, and there were no known aircraft or balloons in the area at the time of the sighting.
