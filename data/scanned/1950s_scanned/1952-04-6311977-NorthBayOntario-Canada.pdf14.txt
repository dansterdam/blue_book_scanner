Can't Ignore Reports, Says Mackenzie
Saladar, Antitman, No Longer Skeptics
Montreal, April 29 (CP) - Dr. P. D. Saladar and Dr. A. M. Antitman, two scientists who were formerly skeptics regarding unidentified flying objects, are no longer skeptical and declare that "scientific research should be carried out in a serious manner to investigate these phenomena, the case of the Dominion Scientists."
Dr. P. D. Saladar, chairman of the National Research Council's associate committee on geophysics, and Dr. A. M. Antitman, chairman of the associate committee on scientific information, made this declaration in an interview here tonight.
"We can no longer ignore the reports," said Dr. Saladar. "The Air Intelligence Claim that such reports can be simply explained away is simply nonsense."
Dr. C. J. Mackenzie, chairman of the Defence Research Board, who has been investigating the flying saucer mystery, declared in an interview that "scientific research should be carried out in a serious manner to investigate these phenomena."
