Dear Sirs:

I saw a flying saucer on the day of November 17, 1959 at 3:45 P.M. The saucer came from the south and went in a hurry toward the East. It was about the size of a small saucer car. The saucer was round like a ball and was of a metallic [?] color. It gave off a [?] and a little noise as it went in a curved upward pattern. The color of it was a very bright metallic, it made me think if I had not seen it I would not [?] anything about it.  The saucer fell out of sight behind a cloud in sight and visibility was very good. The ground wind was moving a southwesterly direction.

When I first saw it it wasn't moving.

Your truly,

P.S. I don't think it was a weather balloon because it went fast for a balloon.
