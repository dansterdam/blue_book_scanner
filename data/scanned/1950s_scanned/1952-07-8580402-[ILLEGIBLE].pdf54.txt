The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically an "Unconventional Type Aircraft" report dated July 8, 1952. The text in the document describes an incident in which a witness reported seeing a "flying disc" that would flash on and off every few seconds. The document also mentions that no confirmation has been made that there are "parties in Detroit who are vacationing in or near the Great Lakes area" related to this incident. The document is signed by the District Commander.

Here is the text from the document:

SD 27-21
SUBJECT: Unconventional Type Aircraft

"The white light around the object seemed to flash on and off for about every 2-3 seconds until it disappeared. 
"This granddad and her mother know that whatever they saw riding across their direction of flight were identical.
"The witness now wishes to make this report to the Air Force Agency, which investigator.
"Confirmation has been made that there are parties in Detroit who are vacationing in or near the Great Lakes area, but unidentified and unknown at this time.
 
Deemed appropriate. Furnish this information and any action the office of special investigations takes in the matter.
