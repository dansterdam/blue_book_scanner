The image contains a photograph that appears to be redacted or obscured. The text in the document appears to be a report from the ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center) regarding an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting. It mentions that the original photographic negative was not sent and that the individual is reluctant to part with the original negative. 

The text in the document is as follows:

ATIC ARDC-4822, 15 Dec 60
2nd Ind
ATIC ARDC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio
TO: ATIC (ARDC-4822), Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio

1. Per your request the pictures on the roll of 35mm were taken inside the object as he could not get the entire object on the film and stated it was dark grey in color. He is reluctant to part with the original Kodak color negative as he states that upon his death it will be destroyed. However, if he can be guaranteed that it will be returned to him, he would be willing to forward it.

2. In view of the foregoing it is recommended that the original Kodak color negative be obtained, if possible, for further analysis. If he does permit the negative to be obtained, it is requested that it be returned to him as soon as the analysis is completed.

TO: ATIC Liaison Office, c/o Boeing Airplane Co., Seattle 24, Washington

In order that the photographic analysis be completed, it is necessary that the original negative be forwarded to this organization as soon as possible.
