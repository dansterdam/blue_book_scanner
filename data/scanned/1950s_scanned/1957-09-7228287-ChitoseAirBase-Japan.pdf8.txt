COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
This Airman reported the photograph and observation was made by the Airman while photographing clouds. The sun was to the east and was not facing the observer at the time. The objects were estimated to be approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter and one-half to one mile in direction as they disappeared. From the Airman's statement, the object disappeared from the viewfinder.
