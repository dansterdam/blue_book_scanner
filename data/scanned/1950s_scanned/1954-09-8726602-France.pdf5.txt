On 14 September 1954, two "flying saucers" were observed over the base of the US Air Force at Orly, France, between 2100 and 2400 hours. They were observed to make sudden turns and stops displaying a whitish glow and traveling at an estimated speed of 500-600 mph. At one point, one of the objects was observed to make a vertical climb of 1,000 feet per second.

Note: During the summer and fall months of 1954, there has been a marked increase in the number of reported sightings of these objects over France. The interest in this phenomenon in France has been quick to publish, in detail, the various sightings as they occur, and a great number of reports have reached us from personal publicity.

As a result, "Flying Saucers", whose book is recently translated into various foreign languages, are now on sale at newstands throughout Europe during the summer of 1954.
