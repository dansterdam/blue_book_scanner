AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

TRP CARR GP (M)
1352  Intelligence
1. On 27 July 1952 at 2305 hours M/ST, what appeared to be an object passed out the window of barracks 2-50 and at an angle of 45 degrees from the horizon. The object appeared on the horizon at 360 degrees at an angle of 75 degrees and descended to an angle of 45 degrees at which it was approximately 10,000 feet above the ground. The object appeared to be cone or cigar shaped and within 1 mile of the point of observation. The object then appeared to be coming from the Southeast and disappeared on the horizon. The object was observed for approximately 45 seconds.

Object: Blank looked like a large pale yellow cylinder (or white ellipsoid) it had rounded ends, windows or portholes lighted brilliantly on the inside were seen. Some color flashed along the horizon. Object seemed larger than it. The whole sight lasted approximately 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. The entire sight was just like shooting star, just a bit slower.
In saying the object made a low hovering curve, I was mistaken. In any event, this hovering of the object is considered to be constructing small light circles.

10 miles, wind 5 m. 5 knots.
