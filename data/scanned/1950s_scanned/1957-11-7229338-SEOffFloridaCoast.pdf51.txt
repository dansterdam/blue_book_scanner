 Dear Mainr Ticain:
 
 In your letter to me dad Sept, 2, 1959 regarding four UFO
 sightings, you said that a UFO sighting 
 occurred in Elmtwood Puli, Fill. on Nov. 1, 1957 was newer
 reported to the USPT.
 
 For your information, two U.S. Air Force officers, in unifrom,
 questioned o began one of the three tvitnesses after one of them
 called O'Hare Air .Force Race. The witnesses were also quoted
 in local WET A mticles.
 
 On Feb. 12, 1959, you note to me that a sighting occurring at
 O'Hare AIY had newer been reported.
 
 The local newspaper (the Des Moinew Journal) and one of the
 witnesses called the Air Force Base about the sighting.
 
 Now, one of two things are happending.
 
 Either you, or your source of information, is holding cut on
 the general public. Lima this is so, it may be necessary to in-
 form one or more of the Illinois Cnngressmen in the future in
 order to obtain more informntion.
 
 The other possibility is , that somehow at O'Hare is not forward-
 ing reports to ATIC at Dayton, thereby violating AFI 200-2.
 
 (Section A, eubsection 4, paragraph a Reporting: reader Com-
 manders of Air Force bases will report all information and evi-
 dence of UFO sightings, including those received from other ser-
 vices, Government agencies, and civil air sources.")
 
 I have :heryo tried to cc,co_perate vdth the AU` Force by report-
 ing orthin A happen to observe and I think it is only fair
 that the Air Force try to co-operate a little morc with the pub-
 lic.
 
 Sincerely yours,
