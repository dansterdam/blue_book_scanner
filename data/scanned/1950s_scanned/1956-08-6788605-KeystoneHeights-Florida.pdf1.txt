10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Small light which was visible for about 30 seconds. It was definite in form but did not resemble any known aircraft or object. It seemed to be hovering or moving slowly overhead, and finally accelerated out of sight in a straight line in a southeastern direction. No sound was heard. It was certainly not any sort of rocket.
11. COMMENTS: Several witnesses saw the light. It was investigated by the local police but no satisfactory explanation was developed.
