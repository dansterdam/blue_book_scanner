This page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with handwritten notes or annotations.

As an OCR system, the text I can extract from this document is:

"Unidentified object observed as a solid circular object descending rapidly with intermittent flashing and apparent heatwaves surrounding object. Observed by several witnesses from Bloomingdale, Indiana at approximately 21:00 hrs on 7 July 1952."
