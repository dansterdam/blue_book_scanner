UNCLASSIFIED

Just regained its original shape and will no longer make it out. I do not have a camera to take a picture to send you. It was about 2 1/2" in diameter and about 1/4" thick. The object was first observed by a young boy, about 12 years of age, at 6:30 pm on July 28, 1952 in Abilene, Texas. The object made a noise as it first appeared to be about 3/4" in diameter and became larger until it was about 2 1/2" in diameter. It then suddenly disappeared to about 1/2" in diameter and soon after went out completely. The Flight Officer at the local airport was immediately notified and he said it was going to the left of the airport and disappeared. This object is the first that has ever been observed in this area.

Enclosed you will find a print to help clarify my sighting report.

If I may be of further services, please do not hesitate to ask.

I have informed the Police Department here in Abilene and expect a report from them soon regarding this sighting. The time of the sighting was approximately 6:30 pm, July 28, 1952, and the object was seen by a young boy, about 12 years of age, in Abilene, and the time. If any of the policemen saw the object, I will send you the information they give me.

I would appreciate any help you can give me that would aid me in making a more accurate report should I see another such object. I will especially want to know how to determine the distance of the object from me, as this all will aid in making a more detailed report.

I am a draftsman with some eight years of experience so I trust my approximations will be close to correct.

Very truly yours,
