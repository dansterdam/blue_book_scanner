The Shreveport Times of 7 November 1950 carried the following account of "flying discs" reportedly sighted by members of a family of Jonessville, Louisiana, on 5 November 1950:

"Jonessville, Nov 5 (Special) - 'Flying saucers' made their first reported appearance over Catahoula Parish Sunday - as the little River town of Jonessville.

"About 1:45 p.m. Judy Pelt, the family cook, was on her way home after washing the dinner dishes. She rushed back into the Peyton house shouting: 'There's a plane coming and it's just hovering right out there in the broad open daylight. They're hovering right out there over the trees.'

"Six members of the Peyton family rushed outside to see. As they watched, the 'saucer' went up to the northeast. There were 'six or eight' of them, so bright and shiny we couldn't tell anything about its shape or size."
