The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image contains text but does not include any photographs.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the output of all the text found in the document:

HIGH SPEED. W WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT
SIGHTED FROM WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT AT APPROXIMATELY 7:59 PM ON JULY 8, 1952 

WHILE PREPARING TO LAND, A FLIGHT CONTROL OFFICER AT WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT SAW SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS MOVING AT HIGH SPEED OVER THE AIRPORT. HE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE TOWER CONTROL OPERATORS AND AN AIR DEFENSE RADAR INSTALLATION AT THE AIRPORT. THE RADAR OPERATORS CONFIRMED THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS ON THEIR SCOPES MOVING AT HIGH SPEED. 

THE OBJECTS WERE OBSERVED TO CONVERGE ON THE AIRPORT, HOVER, THEN RAPIDLY ACCELERATE AND LEAVE THE AREA. SEVERAL AIRLINE PILOTS IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN ALSO OBSERVED THE OBJECTS.

THE CHIEF OF OPERATIONS AT THE AIRPORT STATED THAT THE SIGHTINGS OCCURRED AT A TIME WHEN THERE WAS VERY LITTLE OTHER AIR TRAFFIC IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY.

THE SIGHTINGS WERE REPORTED TO THE AIR FORCE AND INVESTIGATED BY PROJECT BLUE BOOK.
