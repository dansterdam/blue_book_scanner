According to a report published in a Japanese newspaper, at about 10:27 p.m., November 27, 1957, while I was in the backyard of my home in Japan, I saw a white glowing object in the sky. the object was hovering and was about 10 degrees above the horizon, in the southeast. It was a large, round, brilliantly white "flying object". After about 10 minutes, the object suddenly shot upward at a tremendous speed and disappeared from view. There were others who also witnessed the same phenomenon. 
I believe in the existence of "unidentified flying objects" (UFOs) and I am convinced that this object which I saw was an extraterrestrial spacecraft. There have been many other similar sightings in this area and they know that our authorities are investigating this phenomenon.
As an example, a family in Lubbock, Texas, had a similar experience. They saw a formation of silent, glowing objects pass over their home and disappear. This happened in 1951 and was reported to the authorities, but little action was taken.
There have been many other unexplained sightings of strange objects in the sky, both in the United States and in other parts of the world. The "ASTRONOMER'S STATEMENT" below gives some additional information on this subject.
