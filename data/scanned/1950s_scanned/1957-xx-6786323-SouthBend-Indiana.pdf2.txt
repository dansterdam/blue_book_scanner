TOLD MY doctor that was working on my back what I saw in 1957 , at that time was having
sleeping and was sitting in chair, house is on a low hill and object was below
star level and we have a big overhang too, as we have planes flying over our house
thought it was an airplane but thought it would hit our house it was so low,
Watching it more closely noticed it was not moving , larger than a star it sent out a
sort of glow in and out ,watched for two hours from eleven to two A.M. approximately,
when my husband turned lights on the object with tremendous speed headed east I was
facing soth have windows across front room . Following is what I told my Husband and
family I saw.
