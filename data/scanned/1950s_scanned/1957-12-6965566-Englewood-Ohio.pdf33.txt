There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a series of questions related to the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

"Where were you located when you saw the object?
What were you doing at the time you saw the object, and how did you happen to notice it?
IF you were MOVING IN AN AUTOMOBILE or other vehicle at the time, then complete the following questions:
What direction were you looking when you first saw the object?
What direction were you looking when you last saw the object?
If you are able to estimate the number of degrees the object was from true North and also the number of degrees it was upward from the horizon (elevation), when it first appeared and when it disappeared."

The text in this document appears to be a filled-out questionnaire related to a UFO sighting, but there is no photograph included.
