At approximately 1925 EST while southbound at 6000 ft. on a B-18 aircraft flown investigation, members observed a white light, spherical in shape, with the fuselage lights off. As I approached it to get a better look, it showed up in a flash, giving the impression that it might have had a flash attached to it. A second later, it disappeared and another flash was seen at a different location. After a few minutes, we again observed a flash near the first location. We then advised that we had seen the flash.
