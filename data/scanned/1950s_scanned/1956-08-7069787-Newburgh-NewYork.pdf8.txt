A.F.B. if they had sent up any weather

second picture. It showed that
the objects had changed position and
came closer together.

I then called and told my
story to a Lt. Eds by of the Intelligence
Dept. At 12:45 P.M. he came out
to my house. Also, I had a
third picture. He got all the 
information and took the pictures
He said that he would send me
a receipt for them, and which to
this time I have not yet received. Also,
at 1:30 P.M. I took a forth and
last picture for him. If you
have not yet recieved the
pictures, they are at Stewart Field
A.F. Base. I also checked and
found that there was no dirt
on the camera lens which might
have caused it.
