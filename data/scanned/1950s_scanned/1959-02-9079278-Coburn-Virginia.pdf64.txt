The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with points along it, and instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene with a figure in the foreground, and a smaller landscape scene in the corner. The instructions indicate that the larger sketch should be used to show the position of the object when you first and last saw it, with the smaller sketch serving as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
