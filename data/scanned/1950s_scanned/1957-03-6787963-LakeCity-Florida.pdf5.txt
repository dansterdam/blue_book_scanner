The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document related to Project Blue Book, the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document reads:

Proposed reply to letter from ___, 2d March 1957

Dear Miss ___,

This replies to your letter of March 22, 1957 in which you mentioned an unidentified observation you made "approximately 1957."

We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will file your letter for information purposes. At this late date, it would be impractical to undertake a detailed investigation. It is important that an individual report his or her observation as soon as possible. This enables Air Force analysts to perform a comprehensive investigation.

Your interest in the Air Force's program on unidentified flying objects is appreciated. I have included the 1957 report you mentioned.

G.F.
