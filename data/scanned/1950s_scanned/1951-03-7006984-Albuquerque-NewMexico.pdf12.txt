The image appears to be a page from a document titled "PILOTS GUIDE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH AIRWAY STATIONS" which provides guidance on how pilots should communicate with airway stations, including instructions on identification of aircraft, communication procedures, and a radiotelegraph code.

PILOTS GUIDE FOR COMMUNICATING WITH AIRWAY STATIONS

IDENTIFICATION OF AIRCRAFT: Your aircraft is identified by the make of aircraft followed by the certificate number.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - Y".

COMMUNICATION OF AIRWAY STATIONS: CAA Airway Communications Stations are identified by the name of the station followed by the word "RADIO".
Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO".

IDENTIFICATION OF AIRCRAFT: Your aircraft is identified by the make of aircraft followed by the certificate number.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - Y".

After communication has been established, an abbreviated form of identification may be used, if desired, using the last three digits of the certificate number only.

CALL SIGNS: To determine the radio range or radiosignal frequency, pilots should indicate the frequency on which the station is expected to reply.
Example: "CLEVELAND RADIO - THIS IS STINSON THREE SIX FIVE - REPLY ON ONE ELEVEN".

POINT ONE MEGACYCLES OVER: After the airway station has answered your call, proceed with your message without further call up other than preceding the message with the identification call sign of your station as in preceding the weather data or other information that may be required to assist you to your destination.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - GIVE ME CEILING AND AT ELEVEN TWENTY-FOUR THOUSAND FEET FIELD PLAN TO TOLEDO - OVER".

If you are flying VFR, a position report is not required, however, it is to your advantage that the stations along your route of flight know your position at all times in case that assistance can be rendered should you encounter difficulty. Flight plans may be filed with a CAA Airway Communications Station, if your departure was from an airport not served by a CAA station.

The word "ROGER" is used to acknowledge receipt of a message.
The word "OUT" is used when a conversation is ended and no response is expected.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - ROGER - OUT".

The words "SAY AGAIN" are used if a message was not understood and a repetition is desired.
Example: "STINSON ONE THREE SIX FIVE - SAY AGAIN - OVER".

ENROUTE FLIGHT SERVICE: All airway communications stations are ready to provide pilots with enroute flight information and assistance at any time. You may call any CAA RADIO for latest weather along your route of flight, upper wind velocities, airport conditions, and other flight information. If you become lost or unable to determine your position, trained personnel are available at these stations to assist pilots in establishing position by any of the following methods: (a) Visual reference to terrain features, (b) VHF omni-range indications (triangulations).
