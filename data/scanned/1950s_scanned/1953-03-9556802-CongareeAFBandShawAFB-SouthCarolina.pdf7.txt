Transcription of the text in the document:

AT 1715 HOURS, 5 MARCH 1953, 1ST LT. JOHN TAYLER, WAS IN THE BASE OPERATIONS AT CONGAREE AFB, SOUTH CAROLINA AND NOTICED AN OBJECT ON THE BASE RADAR SCOPE AND THE RESTRICTED AREA. LT TAYLER AND HIS RADAR OPERATOR WATCHED THE OBJECT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND PROCEEDED TO CONTACT THE RADAR SITE AT SHAW AFB, SOUTH CAROLINA. THE OBJECT WAS FLYING AT AN ALTITUDE OF 55,000 FEET FROM EAST TO WEST. THE RADAR OPERATORS AT SHAW AFB CONFIRMED THEY ALSO HAD THE OBJECT ON THEIR RADAR SCREENS. THE OBJECT WAS FLYING NORTH AND WHEN DIRECTLY OVERHEAD, IT STOPPED AND HOVERED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. THEN IT PROCEEDED TO MOVE AWAY AND DISAPPEARED FROM THE RADAR SCREENS. LT TAYLER AND HIS OPERATOR WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF AIRCRAFT IT COULD BE USED FOR INTERCEPTIONS.

LT KELLEY TOLD ME THAT A F-51 NATIONAL GUARD A/C AND A/C 4522 WOULD BE SCRAMBLED TO INTERCEPT THE OBJECT. THE F-51 WAS ONLY ABLE TO REACH AN ALTITUDE OF 35,000 FEET AND THE A/C 4522 WAS UNABLE TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE OBJECT. THE PILOTS REPORTED THEY HAD TO BREAK OFF DUE TO LACK OF FUEL AND THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED FROM RADAR.
