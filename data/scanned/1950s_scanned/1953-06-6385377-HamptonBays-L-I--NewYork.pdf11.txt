21 Oct 1953

Mrs. E.
Private Road off Springville Rd.
Hampton Bays, L. I., New York

Dear Mrs. E:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your nice letter of 17 October 1953 addressed to Major General John H. McCormack concerning BLUE BOOK.

Your letter was delivered to the office of Major General John H. McCormack, United States Air Force; however, it is obvious that it was intended for Major General James C. Doolittle, who handled his United States air force flying disk reports during September 1952.

I have taken the liberty of forwarding your letter to the Commander, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, James Chiles. That organization is responsible for investigating flying disk reports for the Air Force.

Sincerely,

GEORGE E. BODLE
Major, USAF
Assistant Executive
Directorate of Intelligence 23-33
