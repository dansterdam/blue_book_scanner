STATEMENT

On 29th of May 1952, climbing to 2,500 feet, airborne to search for enemy aircraft, I noticed a strange object in the sky at about 4 o'clock.

At what was finally the aircraft, and closed up out of the left west to the west, where I could see and returned up to 7,300 feet. The object was rapidly reached: to about 15,900 feet.

Since I was satisfied that it was only another cloud formation, I did not deem it necessary to contact a GOI Control Unit. I united myself with flying.

"I have enclosed a sketch of phenomena observed."

"I hereby certify that I have made the above statements, which I have read for accuracy. In the 51st Troop Carrier Group Intelligence Office, APC 704, this 7th day of June 1952."
