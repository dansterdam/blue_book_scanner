INVESTIGATION:

1. The flight, according to the Captain involved, was in instrument conditions from the time that it reached an altitude of approximately 8,000 feet, it being approximately three and one-half hours later than it reached clear air, a total elapsed time of about four and one-half hours. The aircraft was at all times under positive instrument control and approximately 242 nautical miles north of Jacksonville, Florida.

2. At the time of the incident, the aircraft, according to the instruments, was climbing at approximately 1,000 feet per minute to an altitude of 15,000 feet under a positive heading and airspeed.

3. The object, according to the Flight Engineer Involved, was a high intensity light to the right of the aircraft which appeared to be brilliantly lit for approximately four seconds while it was directly off the right side of the aircraft. It disappeared into the darkness although the radar was scanning over a 150 mile range.

4. The Captain involved was engaged in taking a celestial fix.
