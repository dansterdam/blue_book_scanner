Conclusions: The interviewer believes that the D-17's could have crossed the flight path of the F-86 and still have appeared to be still, considering the altitude of the F-86 and how low the D-17's were flying. This could have appeared to the F-86 pilot as the rising sun from below and behind. I realize that this could have appeared to the F-86 pilot while the F-86 was at about 45,000 feet, however, the pilot stated that the day was unusual and that there were no visible contrails and this was contrary to his normal flying experience. These conditions would indicate a lack of such evidence and the relative angles of the F-86 to the D-17's contrails and the rising sun this conclusion appears most probable.
