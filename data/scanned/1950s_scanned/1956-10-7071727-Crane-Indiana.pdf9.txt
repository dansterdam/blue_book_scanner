1B (8) -AD:ban 
22 November 1956

13. This report was prepared from information submitted by âœ“ Depot Criminal Investigator, interrogation of witnesses, and log entries, by the Legal Officer attached to the Depot whose comments and preliminary analysis of possible causes of the sightings are as follows:

a. The object seen by the five Crane Village witnesses and by the Chief of Police to the East was in all probability the planet Mars or some other celestial body.

b. The object seen from the Administration Building by Chief to the Northwest was probably a celestial body and perhaps the same one seen by Mr.

c. The object seen from 1850 to 1920 to the Northeast was probably a celestial body and perhaps the same one seen by the five Crane Village witnesses.

1!. The descriptions given by the witnesses of all of these objects are consistent with the hypothesis that the objects were celestial bodies. My conjecture is that they were regarded as unidentified flying objects because of the sudden cold snap which probably caused supersaturation of the air with resulting in condensation around the dust particles, thereby removing them and rendering visible the full color and brilliance of celestial bodies, and also perhaps set up unusual degrees of variation in air density which increased the twinkling effect.
