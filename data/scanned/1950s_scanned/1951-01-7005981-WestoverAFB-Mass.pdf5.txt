1. It is suggested that the attached letter be replied to essentially as follows:

a. A preliminary analysis of the basic data communioation indicates that the unknown radar targets were caused by the B-17 aircraft.

b. Additional information, as follows, would aid materially in the analysis of these radar targets:

a. Frequency of approach control, and CCA radars at Westover.
b. Frequency of the haneon on board the referenced B-17.
o. Flight path of the B-17.
d. Track of the targets on the airport control radar. If not available, did the targets always approach from the same direction, and depart in the same direction, or did they come from various directions and depart in various directions? This information is needed to determine if the AGC was interrogating the airborne beacon, or if it were interrogating some other source.
