Statement (Continued)
He was unable to see the object at first and returned to the schoolhouse to make another attempt. He claimed he observed the object for about 20 seconds as it was now ascending at an angle of about 45 degrees in a southeast direction. As it moved away, it soon disappeared below the horizon. The object continued in this manner until it had passed over the ridge south of Solway and disappeared.
About five minutes later, Captain _____ drove up and as he came down the road he sighted the object. _____ stated that as he could see it, it looked toward the ridge and then moved away. The object appeared to be moving at about 15 to 50 miles per hour. It motioned for Captain _____ to hurry out of his car. He came over where we were standing on the island from the gatehouse. Captain _____ looked in there and saw the object about 200 feet high and descending at about 45 degrees in a southeast direction. We saw it for about 10 seconds before it disappeared in a southeast direction at about 1,500 to 2,000 feet. It had a very slow, slower than a plane could dive, downward glide. 
In about five more minutes, _____ and I saw it again about 20 degrees above the center island house. It had a pear shape again and appeared to be about the same size as a small plane. It continued west about 50 feet above the road until we lost it in the trees. None of us noticed any odor at any time.
When I first saw the object, its speed was very slow. It was much slower than a plane could dive. On the 45 degree downward glide, it slowed even more, then it moved across the road; the speed was about 15 miles per hour. During the upward slant, the speed was much faster than the downward glide and 5 miles have been increasing in size because as it drew away, we could see it just as plainly and about the same size as when observed up close.
The wind direction was north-northwest and a 17 h, according to the Knoxville Weather Station.
