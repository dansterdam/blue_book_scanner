UFO Matter Reported to D/I, AFOIN-X

The following incident, and action taken as a result thereof, is reported:

a. At approximately 1550 hours Friday, 7 August 1952, this office received a telephone call from Colonel Gilbert V. Hathaway, USAF, who is Chief of the Air Defense Division, Directorate of Intelligence, Headquarters USAF.

b. Colonel Hathaway demanded the detailed results and analysis of a "flying saucer" report which had been submitted to this office earlier. This information was, somehow, to be used as part of the briefing he was preparing for a TV presentation.

c. Mr. was informed that we could not release information from our files, and that authority from Headquarters USAF would be required to do so.

d. Headquarters, USAF, and the Air Force Public Information Office, were immediately informed of this incident. Preliminary action was taken to determine the reason for Colonel Hathaway's request and the proposed use of the information.

e. It is contemplated that this telephone conversation was being taped. However, this could not be confirmed. At the completion of telephone conversation, which lasted approximately 30 minutes, the information was still withheld.

All material referred to will be made a part of the UFO case file.
