On May 6, 1957, at approximately 8:45 PM, two civilian witnesses, Mr. and Mrs. John Doe, reported observing an unidentified flying object over Washington, D.C.

The witnesses stated that they were standing outside their home when they noticed a bright, disc-shaped object hovering in the sky. The object was estimated to be approximately 50 feet in diameter and was observed for several minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

The witnesses were able to provide a rough sketch of the object, which has been included in the case file. However, no clear photographs or video footage of the incident was obtained.

This report has been forwarded to the Project Blue Book division for further investigation and analysis.
