27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object appeared above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same compass where the object was when you last saw it.
28. Draw arrows on the sketch to show the motion of the object. Is this motion more than one direction? If so, indicate the direction they went.
29. If there were more than one object, then how many were there?
