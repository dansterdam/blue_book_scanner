c. The target exhibited a slight oscillating movement, deviating from a straight course approximately 1/2 mile on either side.
d. The target disappeared from the scopes after approximately 3 minutes of tracking.

3. Extensive visual and electronic searches were immediately initiated, but no confirmation of the target could be made.

4. This incident has been classified as "Unidentified" since the radar target could not be correlated with any known or suspected aircraft in the area at that time.
