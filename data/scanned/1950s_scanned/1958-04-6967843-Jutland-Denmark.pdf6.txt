COMMENTS (use reverse, if necessary)

1. A thorough check of our files indicates that the two sightings referenced by Sgt. [redacted] were not received by this office and no findings are available for release.

2. Our interpretation of Sgt. [redacted]'s request is that he be given permission to release the information concerning the two sightings to civilians. Analysis - not the findings or analyses made by this office.

3. Reference/paragraph 2 of Sgt [redacted]'s letter. Paragraph 11y AFR 200-2 means exactly what it says. No, I repeat, no Air Force personnel, other than those of the OIS, or those and directed, will converse with private individuals concerning UFO cases. A military person, given an unofficial interview, might still be quoted, and when he is quoted his statements are usually construed to be those of the Air Force.
