10. A large number of aircraft were in the area at the time. New York CAA
reports that it would be very difficult to state the exact number, due to the time
lapse and the various reports and also because CAA does not have records of many of the
flights.

The Brooklyn, Bronxville and Long Island areas have been very active with
power search light operations. Search light teams reflecting from the proxy or haze
layer or from distant clouds and with other similar light visibility, tend to produce
attention of unknown air activity. A search light orbit is apt to appear as
though suddenly appeared (in direction) (ref para 2) and lack as a reflecting clone
surface would make the object disappear.

I have no doubt the objects observed were both the result of search light
activity and the reflection on under surfaces of low hanging clouds.

12. Negative.
