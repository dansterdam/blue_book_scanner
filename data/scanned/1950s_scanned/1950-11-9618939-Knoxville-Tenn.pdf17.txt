Airborne sampling runs should be made adjacent to and through the top of the inversion layer (approximately 500 feet at 2300 local time).

As a general policy, radar (TPS-1D) should be obtained in conjunction with the present 25-band set. Test runs have shown that there is very little correlation with time between targets picked up during duetting conditions on the two frequency bands. Therefore, a comparison of the returns from the two radars will give an indication of whether the targets are due to 'ducting.'

If possible, the Weather Bureau personnel and radar ridge should be brought to work on the problem on a cooperative basis.
