SAFITS-3/Maj. Tacker/jmd/74996/2/2Feb 58

24 February 1958

Dear Mr.

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your
letter of 20 January 1958 addressed to Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base, Ohio, concerning an unidentified flying
object.

The object you observed was probably one of the
new radar-search aircraft designated WR-2. This aircraft
has the same general configuration of a strato-cruiser,
as mentioned in your letter.

For your information illustrations of this type
aircraft are inclosed, together with latest Department
of Defense Fact Sheet on this subject, dated 5 November
1957.

Thank you again for your interest in this subject.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
