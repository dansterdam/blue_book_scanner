UFO ANALYSIS SHEET
Location: Castroville, Texas
Date: 18 Oct 57
Time: 2:00 a.m.
Description: Cigar-shaped object, fire or exhaust coming off, some smoke (cant define) 
Direction of Motion: traveling at downward tilt, over toward TX highway
Satellite (moon, Jupiter, star, etc.) was out at the time. Astronomical Phenomena (meteor, comet, planet, etc.): Order - explained - Radar Analysis (ACRCIRC) nada
Natural Phenomena (ball lightning, etc.): No
Evaluation of Source Reliability: Probable case
Analysis and Conclusions: Given all the pertinent data, this appears to be a relatively dependable sighting. The cigar-shape and exhaust or fire from the object, as well as its downward tilt and course over the highway, seem to indicate a powered aerial vehicle of some kind. The lack of an astronomical explanation or natural phenomena supports this. While the witness reliability is marked as "probable", this seems to be a reasonable assessment of the case. More evidence would be needed to make a definitive conclusion, but this appears to be a genuinely unexplained UFO encounter.
