UNCLASSIFIED DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS. DOD DIR 520010

1. Project grudge personnel made a trip to Lubbock, Texas, on 9 November 1951 to obtain a first-hand report of the phenomena and interview the college professors and their stories. A written statement of their observations and findings was requested at this time.

The investigators were convinced that the objects observed were not conventional aircraft. The strange nature of the lights was recounted in detail by a number of college professors who had observed the same objects that many students had reported seeing.
