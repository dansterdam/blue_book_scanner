Dear Mr. *******.

In reply to your telegram of 13 January 1950, I have the following information to report:

The U. S. Air Force has no record of a receipt for the $25.50 photograph you gave the CIA officer in Cleveland. Therefore, I suggest you make oontact with the individual mentioned In your telegram, as I find one the correct name of the agency forwarding the film.

Sincerely,
