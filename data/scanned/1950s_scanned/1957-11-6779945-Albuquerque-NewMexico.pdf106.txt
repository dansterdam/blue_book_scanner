The image does not contain a photograph, but rather appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document. The page contains textual information, which I will extract and provide below:

"'Thing' Over Geauge
Makes Geiger Click
"'Thinkink" that might have seen or heard of things, see below that when any radio-active material comes near the Geiger counter, the click will increase, as this shows the radioactivity or atomic disintegration in the material. 
So when the "Thing" passed over the Geiger counter, it set off a clicking, which means the "Thing" contained some radioactive material.
The "Thing" was about 6 feet in diameter and seemed to be cigar-shaped. It made no noise and left no trail, but they find that it set off the Geiger counter near by. This is hard to explain, but that is what happened.

'Thing' Makes Geiger Field Radioactive
Car Parked TV

Sheriff spotte about a strange peak Antenna
Just as I turned on my
TV this evening, the picture faded out. Just then the Sheriff called me over the phone and said some strange object had been sighted in the sky and had knocked out TV reception for miles around.
It had been followed by several people who reported that when it passed over a parked car, the Geiger counter in the car showed a sharp rise in radioactivity.
The object was described as about 30 feet in diameter, round, and metallic in appearance. It made no sound and left no trail, but did seem to affect nearby electrical and electronic equipment.
The reports indicate that the object may have contained a radioactive material of some kind.
This is just another incident of the many strange objects that have been sighted in our skies in recent years."
