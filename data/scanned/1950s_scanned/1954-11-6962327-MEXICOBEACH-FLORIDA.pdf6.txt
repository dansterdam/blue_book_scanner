METEOEITE STRUCK MRS. HEWLETT HODGES FALL THROUGH ROOF

Woman Demands A. F. Return Fallen Meteorite

SYLACAUGA, Ala., Dec. 1 â€” A meteorite, six inches in diameter, fell through the roof of Mrs. Hewlett Hodges' home here Tuesday afternoon and struck her, causing a bruise on her hip and hand. 
     The 32-year-old Mrs. Hodges is the only known person ever struck by a meteorite. She was only slightly injured, however, and the meteorite, which fell from a 10-mile high altitude, was recovered from her home.
     An explosion visible in three states was reported to the Air Force base at Wrigiht-Patterson Field, Ohio.
     Mrs. Hodges, who was lying on her sofa when the meteorite came through the roof, said she planned to turn the stone-like object over to the Air Force as a souvenir.
     "It looked something like a shell but blue off-white smoke came out of it," she said. Mrs. Hodges has turned the meteorite over to the Air Force and officials there are examining it. They say it will be returned to her later.
