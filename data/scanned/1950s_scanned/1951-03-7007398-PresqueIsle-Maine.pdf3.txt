The image provided is a page from an old Project Blue Book report. There does not appear to be any photograph or image present in this particular page. The text on the page appears to be an official U.S. Air Force report form with various questions about a UFO sighting, including details about the object's shape, color, size, and movement.

Transcribing the text from the document:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?
YES. IT STARTED DOWN TOWARDS THE TREES AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THEM.

15. Did the object move behind something or any time, particularly a cloud?

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud?

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
(a) Sound: IT WAS LIKE THE USUAL JET ENGINE NOISE

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the match head. If you have no known object, note how much of the sky the object seemed to cover.

Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw, such as wings, projections, etc., and especially indicate the direction the object was moving. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
