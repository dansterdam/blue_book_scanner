The preliminary analysis of the basic communication indicates that
this unknown radar target were almost assuredly caused by the beacon in
the B-17 aircraft.

2. Additional information, as follows, would aid materially in the
analysis of these radar targets:

a. Frequency of approach control, and GCA radars at Westover.
b. Frequency of the beacon on board the referenced B-17
c. Flight path of the B-17
d. Track of the target on the airport control radar. If not
available, did the targets appear to arrive and depart in the opposite direction, or did they approach and leave the airfield on the same heading. (This will
help to determine if the fact was interception the airborne
beacon, or if it was not located to one GCA pulse).
