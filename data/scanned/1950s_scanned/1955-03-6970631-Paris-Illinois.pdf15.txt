Here is a rough sketch of the object according to the witness's description. It was described as oval and about the size of a pie plate. It hovered at first, then moved slowly back and forth, then disappeared.
It could certainly not possibly been an aircraft, the witness stated, and there was no noise or trail of any kind.
