Pane: A detailed report of an incident occurring at on 2 1953 which involved 4 Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). At on 2 May 1953 at the NEN RADAR Station located near Baltimore, Maryland, the radar operators observed four objects on their radar scopes which were traveling at an estimated speed of 1,000 mph. The objects were not shown to be aircraft and their movement indicated that they were not subject to atmospheric conditions. After observing the objects for some twenty minutes the operators notified Air Defense Command which in turn notified the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) located nearby. The OSI dispatched an officer who arrived at the radar station and was able to observe the objects visually as well as on the radar scope. An intensive search of the area was conducted and no planes or other normal aerial objects were found. The incident was reported to higher headquarters and the file was forwarded to Project Blue Book for further analysis.
