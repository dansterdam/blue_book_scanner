There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

EDWARDS: (Cont'd)
They say that intelligently-guided
objects, originating from the 
moon, or the planets, or even from
far-off galaxies, already are in 
space ... some have even pene-
trated our atmosphere to
observe life on earth.
True...false? We don't know...
but we intend to find out....
we intend to..

DISSOLVE TO:
(FILM, ACTUAL EFFECT...SLOW MOVE-
MENT OF CAMERA THROUGH SIMULATED 
GALAXIES)
...get the facts...as, together,
we probe into the intriguing
puzzle of UFO ... Unidentified
Flying Objects...better known
as Flying Saucers.
