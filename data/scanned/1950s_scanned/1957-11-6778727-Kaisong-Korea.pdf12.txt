in the demilitarized zone of Korea saw a brilliant flash of light 
in the western sky. The flash was described as blue-white, de

1 inch to 18 inches wide, which lasted approximately 30 minutes. 
The flash was visible for about 3 seconds to 3 minutes, varying with observers. A trail of smoke, which was similar to a jet vapor trail, was visible for a jet vapor time.
