"NO. CASE (Information Only)

30 January 1958
Between Arequipa and Lima, Peru

UFO Stalls Car Engines in Peru: On January 30 a Peruvian lawyer, Dr. [redacted], was driving from Arequipa to Lima with his wife and her brother. At 11:55 p.m. their Dodge 200 miles north of Arequipa on the Panamericana Highway, when their headlights went out and the engine died. The driver stopped the car. Then they noticed an object descending from the sky. As it neared a height of about 150 meters, it began to emit a sort of reddish 'explosion' (presumably orange-red) color. For 5 minutes it remained completely motionless, then disappeared into the cloudy sky. A truck and a bus going to Lima were also stopped. Dr. [redacted] said that in all three vehicles the passengers felt a nervous shock before the UFO appeared overhead. Trams (N.Y.): Feb. 1, 1958. (Same as France and Levelland, Texas; one assumes that a lawyer is not a hoaxer.)"
