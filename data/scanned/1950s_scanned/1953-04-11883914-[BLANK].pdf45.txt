Analysis of Existing Sighting Reports

The file of sighting reports for 1948 has been studied in detail. Information on these reports has been coded by using Exhibit I, Tentative Observer's Data Sheet; Exhibit II, Codes; and Exhibit III, Work Sheets of the June 6 report. The coded data on the work sheets are now being transferred to IBM punched cards, as shown in Exhibit III of the June 6 report. When a file of about 150 of these coded sightings is completed, preliminary analysis trials with the IBM system will be started.

Newspaper Clipping Service

The newspaper clippings are now being sent directly to the Sponsor as requested in June.

Future Work

The coding of existing sighting reports will be continued at an accelerated rate during July. Preliminary analyses will be made with the IBM system.

A separate report on the findings of Dr. J. Allen Hynek will be prepared.

The interrogation forms are expected to be completed in July.
