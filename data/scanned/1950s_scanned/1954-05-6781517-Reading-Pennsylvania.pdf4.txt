Dear Sir:

today evening at 11:25 p.m. I saw from my home (and other witnesses were present at the same time on our block) a light in the sky. It looked like a star or planet but it kept on moving rapidly, in a circular orbit, suddenly speeding up and then slowing down. In doing this, it also seemed to go up and down in elevation, as though it was following a curved path. After doing this for 5 to 10 minutes, it suddenly took off at a very high speed, going in a straight line toward the northeast and disappearing in the distance in a matter of a few seconds.
I heard no roaring noise in the sky. I looked up just as the object was completing its circular motion and heading out toward the northeast. There were other people out on our street at the time who, in turn, also saw the brilliantly glowing object moving rapidly through the sky. I was able to observe it for a matter of 5 to 10 minutes and it definitely was not an airplane, helicopter, or any other known object. Its motion was unlike anything I had ever seen before, and I feel quite certain that it was some kind of unidentified flying object. There is no doubt in my mind that this was not an hallucination or a jet plane. I have no idea what it could have been, unless it was possibly a jet plane. However, the appearance and motion were so completely different from that of a jet plane that I am convinced it was not. I would appreciate any information you could give me regarding this incident.

Sincerely yours,
