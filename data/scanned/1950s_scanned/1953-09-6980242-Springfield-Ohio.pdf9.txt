The image contains three sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line labeled "A" to indicate how high an object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it, and a second curved line labeled "B" to show how high the object was above the horizon when the observer last saw it.

The second and third sketches show landscapes from the observer's perspective, with an object in the sky in the second sketch.

"32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) where you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch."
