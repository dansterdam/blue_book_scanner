Transcription of the text in the document:

This is an actual case report taken from the files of Project Blue Book. The case is still classified as "unidentified" by the Air Force. This is an authentic account of the incident as submitted by the investigator.

The incident occurred on the evening of July 14, 1951, at approximately 9:00 PM in Monmouth, New Jersey. The observer, a professional man, was standing outside his home when he observed an unidentified object in the sky. 

He described the object as approximately 50 to 60 feet in diameter, round, and metallic in appearance. It was first observed to the Northeast and was moving in a Southwesterly direction at an estimated speed of between 600 to 800 mph. The object was observed to be slightly above the horizon and was clearly visible against the darkening sky. 

The observer stated that the object appeared to have a glowing or fluorescent type of illumination, not unlike the glow of hot metal. It was also noted that the object was completely silent, and appeared to be under intelligent control. After being observed for approximately 1 minute, the object rapidly accelerated and disappeared from sight. The observer estimated the object was observed over a distance of from 5 to 7 miles. 

This is a rather unusual case in that the observer was a professional man, fully capable of making accurate observations. The Air Force investigator was impressed with the sincerity and apparent reliability of the witness. The investigator felt that the object could not have been any known type of aircraft or natural phenomenon. The case was therefore classified as "unidentified".
