The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an 'A' marked on it, indicating how high the object was above the horizon. The second sketch shows a larger landscape view with an 'A' and a 'B' marked, presumably representing different positions of the observed object.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to another sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
