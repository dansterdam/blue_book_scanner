III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: The long object appeared suddenly in the SW and glowed like a sky rocket. You see on the 4th of July for about fifteen seconds, while it had no particular shape, it was about the size of an automobile headlight. The source thought the object was about one block away from him. The path traveled by the sighting was almost straight downward towards the earth.
The object changed color from blue to white to red and then seemed to slowly burn itself out. At first it appeared solid but later turned transparent.
There were scattered clouds, many stars and a slight breeze when the incident occurred at 19:22 CET, according to the source.

Source stated that his mother who was on duty with him 'agreed with his description.
