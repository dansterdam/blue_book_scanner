The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

WHEDON: (Cont'd)
The plane involved ... Flight 257 was 347 miles southwest of Bermuda ... 705 miles east of Jacksonville.
The other planes are grouped around it ... the farthest plane that reported a sighting was 175 miles away.

CUT BACK TO WHEDON
The major clues we had to work on were the color, the trajectory and the fact that three of the planes reported that the object seemed to split apart in the air.
This description coincides with the known features of what are called "bolides" or "fireballs" ... a rather rare astronomical phenomenon ... but reported from time to time, especially from the Southwest.
