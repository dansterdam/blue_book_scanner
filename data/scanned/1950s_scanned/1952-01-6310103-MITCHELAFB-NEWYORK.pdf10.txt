Balloons are launched from 40° 43' 1", 73° 35 1/2' W. Two balloon launches were observed and it was noted that the balloons could be seen until the slant range was about 5,000 ft., at which time they were lost from sight.

III. Tower Personnel

The personnel who were in the tower at the time of the sighting were interrogated. Their only contact with the pilot is given in the Form 112 and it took place after the incident. They also advised the pilot that a balloon had been launched in the area during the time of the sighting.

The object subtended an angle the same as a house (30 ft. - 40 ft.) on the ground. He first decided that it wasn't a chute when he realized that
