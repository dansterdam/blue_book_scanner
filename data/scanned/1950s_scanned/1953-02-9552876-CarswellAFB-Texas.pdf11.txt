A document was received at this headquarters on 9 February 1953 concerning a report of an unidentified flying object sighting at the Carswell AFB, Texas area on 2 February 1953. The report, as submitted by the observer, 1st Lt XXXXXXX, is as follows:

"On 2 February 1953, at approximately 0700 hours, while on routine flight crew duty, I observed an unidentified object in the sky over Carswell AFB, Texas. The object was first sighted approximately 25 miles southwest of Carswell at an altitude of around 10,000 feet. As it approached Carswell, the object descended to an altitude of approximately 5,000 feet. It appeared to be round or oval in shape and was metallic or light in color. The object was about the size of a B-36 bomber, and moved at an approximate speed of 300 knots. It was under excellent observation for approximately 1 to 2 minutes before it disappeared from view by rapidly climbing to an altitude where it could no longer be seen."

The report indicates that this sighting was promptly reported to the base operations office and the 3 rd Air Division, the report was reviewed and forwarded to this headquarters for appropriate action.
