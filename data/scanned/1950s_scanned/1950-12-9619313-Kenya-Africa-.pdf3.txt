SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: 
Playing golf on the Nairobi course while staying at the "Wining Lodge." Saw a disc rifle fly back and forth after first being noticed coming up from the east. It made no noise. 
"On the morning of 9 Dec 50, while standing on the 6th tee of the Nairobi Golf Course, I noticed a strange object coming up from the east, traveling towards the west. It made no noise whatsoever. This object had the appearance of a metallic disc or saucer, and was flying in an erratic manner, darting back and forth. It continued in this manner for about 15 to 20 seconds, when suddenly it took off at a tremendous speed, disappearing from sight over the edge of the course. This all took place within a period of 30 to 40 seconds. The object was about 10 to 15 feet in diameter, and appeared to have no wings or other visible means of propulsion. Its color was a metallic silver, which reflected the sun's rays."
