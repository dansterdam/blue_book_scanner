The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document discussing the possibility of aircraft and various phenomena based on the speed and altitude of an object.

The text in the document reads:

UNCLASSIFIED
The speed and altitude eliminates the possibility of aircraft.
The elevation, 60Â°, eliminates the possibility of a mirage or any phenomena based on the reflection or refraction of light from an inversion layer.
One possibility is that the object was a star or planet. The azimuth angle from two stations should have been more nearly the same if this is true, but a calibration error could cause the difference. The key is probably the angular velocity.

Conclusions
No conclusions can be made until the angular velocity can be checked against that of astronomical bodies.
