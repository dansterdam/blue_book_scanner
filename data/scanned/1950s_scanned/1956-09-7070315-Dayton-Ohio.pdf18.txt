Memo for record:
Called Mr. & reserve statement that agent was already notified 'remained to fight for instant"got same at 9:50. Report from Magician shows "yellow luminous discs", etc. Coincide as exactly for speed.
My discussion, Mr. stated that he may have been misimpressed and may have had "this pattern in his eyes" that the expert in hypnotic flight has gone farther in saying this property in day light as it gone away in the dark to be seen.
