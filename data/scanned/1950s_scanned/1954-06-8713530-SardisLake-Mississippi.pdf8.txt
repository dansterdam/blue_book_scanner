CORPS OF ENGINEERS, U. S. ARMY
OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT ENGINEER
VICKSBURG DISTRICT
U. S. COURT HOUSE BLDG.
VICKSBURG, MISSISSIPPI

REFER TO FILE NO. LMKV8

SUBJECT: Fallen Object - Sardis Lake, Mississippi.
TO:  Intelligence Officer, U. S. Air Force,
     Washington, D. C.

1. On 4 June 1954, Mr. __, a resident near Sardis Lake, reported that he saw a strange object fall near Sardis Lake, near Sardis Dam, where he was fishing. He reported this to the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, Lake and Dam. It was decided to conduct a search of the general locality where the object supposedly fell. It was determined that the object was in several pieces and could not be located. Since the normal plan of operations of our reservoir called for draining during the summer months, it was felt that the object would be exposed and perhaps could be recovered. Close observation was maintained and the object was recovered on 20 September 1954. Air Force personnel from the Greenville Air Base were contacted and identified the object as a signal corps radio.

2. In view of the frequent reports that are made in the papers concerning unidentified objects, it is believed that this information would be of value to your office for clearing up at least one unconfirmed report.

Inclosure:
1 - Report w/2 newspaper clippings.
