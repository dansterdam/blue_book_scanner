AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified flying object, Guam, M.I.
DATE OF INFORMATION: 19 Dec 52
PLACE: Andersen AFB, Guam

13-a. On 19 Dec 52, at 0650, three (3) ground crew personnel of the 54th Strat. Recon. Sqdn. reported that they sighted an unidentifiable object traveling at an approximate heading of 270 degrees at an estimated speed considerably in excess of that of a conventional jet aircraft.

The object appeared to be cylindrical in shape, silvery color with a bright silvery flame trailing from the aft section. There was no exhaust or vapor trail observed. A similar or the same object was observed by two pilots of a B-17 at approximately 100 miles from Guam on a heading approximately 270 degrees during the same time span as the original sighting from the ground.

There appears to be no reason to doubt the validity of the observers' claims of sighting a flying object. Although the ground observers have not been trained in aircraft identification, the two pilots have had considerable experience and stated the object sighted did not appear to be a conventional type aircraft to their knowledge.
