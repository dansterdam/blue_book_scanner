Cason advised that it had been reported to the Office of the AG of S-2 Commanderr at Lawton, Oklahoma, that on 19 October 1958, an unidentified balloon had landed on the property of S.F. Temple, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The balloon was described as being approximately seven (7) feet square (deflated) and consisting of a thin plastic material. No instruments of any kinds.

The linguist further advised that this would normally appeared in small pamphlets or leaflet drops directed to the American soldier during the DOWNGRADE RESTRICTIONS:
