This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text reads as follows:

a. The reports will by regulation be forwarded to SAFOJ for initial evaluation and storage. An officer with a technical background, and preferably with intelligence experience, will be assigned to this branch of SAFOJ charged with this responsibility and will conduct this initial evaluation.

b. Those reports which reach SAFOJ which give indication of having possible significance value or scientific possibilities will be forwarded to ATIC and/or ARDC for further evaluation and/or exploitation.

c. The conduct of the program in the field (investigations) will still be the responsibility of the Air Force bases. As the basis it will still be preferably the intelligence function which will be responsible for these investigations.

3. The advantages of this transfer are:
a. SAFOJ is familiar with the Aerial Phenomena program.
b. Reports will be evaluated immediately at the office responsible for public relations.
c. The reports which show promise of additional value, either from an intelligence and/or scientific viewpoint, will be forwarded to specialized agencies for further exploitation. Under this method of operation the number of reports which agencies such as ATIC and ARDC are required to handle would be cut to a minimum, allowing for more man-hours per report and consistent better analysis and evaluation.

d. The program will lose some of the aura of mystery which surrounds it due to its association with Intelligence.

e. ATIC will be free to apply man-hours, previously applied to the UFO project, to other programs more beneficial to the Air Force.
