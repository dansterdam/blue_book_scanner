The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force's study of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text from the document:

I have consulted with Lt. Colonel in the preparation of his statement in connection with sighting flying objects (lights) on 9 January 1953, over Santa Ana, California. As a result of this consultation I feel his statement is complete and accurate and I can therefore add nothing to that account.

Charles G. Lovelass
1st Lt. USAF
