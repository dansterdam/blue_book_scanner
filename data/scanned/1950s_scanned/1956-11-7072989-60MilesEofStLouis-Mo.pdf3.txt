AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: 33 AL-141, Proving Ground Command US Air Force Base, Florida
REPORT NO: 12-56  
INCLOSURE #1
STATEMENT BY CAPTAIN DANIEL
I was the Aerial Weather Reconnaissance Officer on the night of 1 November 1956. At 2:25 A.M. I sighted a strange light at approximately 23,000 feet about 60 miles E of St. Louis, Mo. After reaching an altitude of 33,000 feet, I steady orange light with a low-level flight path was visible. The object was about 25-30 elevation angle and 2-3 of arc in its apparent size. The aircraft's speed was much greater than the surrounding jet aircraft. I was unable to judge the distance, direction of movement, or altitude of the object. I do not believe it was a meteor as there was no trail, nor a falling or explosion characteristic. I am uncertain as to the exact duration of the sighting, but it was increasing nearly 5 minutes. The object suddenly disappeared from sight as if it turned off its light. I transmitted sighting and unrestricted visibility of at least 60 miles. The cloud coverage was minimal on the East and Southeast horizon, and the visibility for this reported sighting.
The above statement was given to Captain William M. Lyons by Capt Daniel.
