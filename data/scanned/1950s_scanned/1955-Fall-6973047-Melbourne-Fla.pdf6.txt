The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document from the Headquarters 4602d Air Intelligence Service Squadron (ADC) in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The document is regarding "Civilian Saucer Intelligence" and is addressed to the Commander of the Air Technical Intelligence Center in Dayton, Ohio. The key points in the text are:

1. A letter received from an individual in New York City is being forwarded for information and action.

2. This correspondence was forwarded by Headquarters, Eastern Air Defense Force, and apparently is one of many such inquiries received from this saucer "enthusiast" by EADF.

3. The directive is to have EADF forward all such correspondence directly to ATIC upon future receipt.

The document is signed by Richard B. Mandle, Major, USAF, Assistant Adjutant.
