The elevation is approx 100 ft. However, the elevation on the altitude was 40,000 ft. Observers saw the object move through a cloud layer (can seen cloud cover 3/4). The object appeared to be extremely fast moving, as if it was being tracked or lost moving through our coverage. Only 5 were made on one of converging with no final action.
