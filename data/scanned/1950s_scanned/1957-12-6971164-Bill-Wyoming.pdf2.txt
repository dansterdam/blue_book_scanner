24 February 1958

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your letter of 2 January 1958 addressed to the Weather Records Processing Center in San Francisco has been referred to this office for reply.

From your description the sighting you observed on 22 December 1957 was a fireball or bolide. The description (lighting) and other characteristics are similar to sightings of bolides in that area last year.

Thank you for your detailed report. Your interest in this subject is appreciated.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
