Other Causes of Reports
Naturally balloons, aircraft and astronomical bodies do not account for all
the sightings. We have a smaller percentage of other things, such as ducks flying
over drive-in theaters at night, searchlights on clouds, bumps, pieces of paper
caught in an updraft, and many other things that cause reports. These are very
difficult to check and to check them we normally go back to old sightings. For
example, sometime back, approximately a year ago, the city of Fargo, North Dakota,
was somewhat disturbed by glowing objects that the city on various nights.
Finally, some of the more enterprising souls in the city took enough interest in the
subject to attempt to determine what they were. All it was were flocks of ducks or
geese reflecting the city's lights. We will take a case like this and mentally file
it. When we come across a similar report, we'll go back and compare the two reports.
If they are similar enough, we will write the new report off as being the same thing.
This is about the only method we have of checking such things.

Radar Sightings
We receive quite a few radar sightings and we are very aware of the fact
that weather affects and interference between the two radars can give many odd
returns. In some cases we are definitely able to show how these radar signals
occurred, other times we are not able to definitely show how it happened. We
hope that as more study is put on the subject of radar anomalies that more and
more of our reports will be explainable.
There are no reports of radar sightings in our file that cannot be questioned
to some degree. In none of the cases of erratic or high speed (above Mach 1) that
