The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document, likely a project blue book report, describing an unidentified object observed in the sky.

I cannot be sure of this, that the object moved in its position both horizontally and vertically with relation to this cloud. I do not know whether it moved further from or nearer to the vessel or whether the diameter or the luminous portion of the disk varied; i.e., whether it contracted and expanded. At any rate, after I had the object under observation for a period of 1 minute and 45 seconds, it disappeared by a gradual fading. During the process of this fading, the diameter did not change. 

In other words, I had the impression that the light simply shut off, rather than that the object disappeared by moving elsewhere.

During the course of this incident, the sun bore on the port side of the vessel, perhaps one point off the port bow, and was perhaps 20째 from the horizontal. At this time, the sun and the surrounding sky was a pale pink color as contrasted to the brilliant silver color of the object. However, the sun was obscured from my sight at all times while I was standing by the swimming pool by the super-structure of the deck above and further forward.

Subsequently, I wrote a letter to the Staff Captain of the ship requesting the position of the vessel as of the moment when I first saw the object... I have a letter from the Staff Captain indicating that the ship's position at that time was 42째19' N., 55째07' W. and that the vessel was on a course of 260째30'. I do not know whether any of the officers of the ship or the watch saw this object, but I am inclined to think that they must have. My wife was standing beside me except that I cannot be sure of this.
