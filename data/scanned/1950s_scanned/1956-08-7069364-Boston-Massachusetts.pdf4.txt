"22 Aug 1956
I investigated the sighting reported by C. (deleted) of Boston, Mass.
C. reports that at about 9:45 pm on August 22nd 1956, he was outside in his back yard on Davis St. (Dorchester) and observed an unusual object in the sky. He described it as 'larger than a star and very bright.' It appeared to him to be hovering in one position in the sky and then moved around somewhat irregularly. He watched it for about 15-20 minutes and then it disappeared by going up and away in the western sky.
C. states that he has seen satelites before but said that this was definitely not a satelite. He also indicated that the object was not an airplane or a helicopter. He said that it looked very unusual and different from anything he had seen before.
There were no other witnesses reported to the sighting. 
Based on the sighting as described, the object was most likely a satelite or other familiar celestial object. There is no evidence to indicate that an unusual or unconventional aerial phenomena was observed."
