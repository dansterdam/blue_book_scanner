Nature: 1830, 1893

The magazine Nature, subtitled "A Weekly Illustrated Journal of Science", reported an unusually interesting sighting in its 20 May 1830 issue. The item on "remarkable phenomena observed at Katternau, near Frankforton-Maine (Germany)" described "an enormous number of luminous bodies" which "rose from the horizon and passed in a horizontal direction from east to west." They moved through space like a string of beads alone with a remarkably brilliant light." Some were estimated to the "the size of a walnut," others resembling "sparks from a chimney," and, in connection with these estimates of size, it is important to bear in mind that apparent size and real size are two very different things, especially as applied to celestial phenomena.

In the 25 May 1893 issue of Nature appeared the much-quoted sighting report. The "unknown lights of Japan". It stated that "the globes altered in their formation... took the form of a crescent or diamond, or hung festoon-fashion in a curved line".
