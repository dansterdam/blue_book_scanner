LJV-register is miles, in the  between April and Jul-/ report.  The complete rial survey since it cannot be used has reported: arrivea and the completion of the survey. It is of great coniidence in is necessary. Inasmuch as the information being furnished under the conditions of Project. But that it, is not the point of this letter. 
From official of the Jorth American Defense Command, it appears that neither the ment have been able to ientity and locate the object described in the sight similar survey, through the post 36 hours, and that all of the observation was determined to be false or of more in nature. It appears the visual and radar observations are valid, but that the object having disappeared-threat under present international conditions.
The DENVER POST OFFICF concerning the disappearance of this object. Anyone who nowledcerning the movement either the bject, or any similar unidentified object in their vicinity, could it approbcitively let this officT know. It is possible that any sighting or location data would be considerable nce in determining the character and the status of this sighting.
From now on, it appears to me that unless these is a positive reports from responsible observers will be entered into official recorthe s o n it will be considered indication of existence of some international cataclysmic-dL.hna. This would indicate in my opinion an extremely dangerous situation confronting our country and liberty, and literally bankrupt our country with some destructive action necessary would be considered. It is my hope that some means of correcting this extremely dangerous situation.

Sincerely yours,
H. N. STAN
