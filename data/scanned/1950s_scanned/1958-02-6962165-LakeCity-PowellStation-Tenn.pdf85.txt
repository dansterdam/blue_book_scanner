BETWEEN NAZARE AND SALVADOR 
LORENZO P. 1353 1 WITNESSES 
AND MENDS AND A FRIEND, ANTONIO DE ARAUJO, WIRE DRIVING BETWEEN NAZARE AND SALVADOR. THEY SAW SOMETHING IN THE SKY .... 
THE TWO VILLAGES. SANTO ANTONIO DE JESUS AND CONCEICAO DA (TNHA. AT ONCE THEY STOPPED THE CAR AND TRIED TO LOCATE THE TROUBLE, BUT TO NO AVAIL. THE NEXT MOMENT THE OBJECT WAS GONE. 
IT WAS THEN THAT THEY SPOTTED A LUMINOUS OBJECT HOVERING OVERHEAD, ACCORDING TO DR. L.J.FONTES, CBPDEC, WHO COMPILED THIS REPORT. IT GLOWED WITH A STRANGE LIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE WHOLE OBJECT. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES, AND THEN DISAPPEARED QUITE SUDDENLY, AS IF THE OBJECT DREW ITSELF UP QUICKLY. 
THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE TWO HEMISPHERES ONE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. THERE WAS A SORT OF INTENSE BRILLIANT GLOW SURROUNDING THE WHOLE OBJECT. THE OBJECT CAME INTO VIEW FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN DISAPPEARED, OBSERVERS AND ABOUT NINETY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. THEN IT DESCENDED IN A VERTICAL STRAIGHT LINE UNTIL IT REACHED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT STOPPED AND REMAINED MOTIONLESS FOR SEVERAL SECONDS, THEN IT SHOT UPWARD VERY QUICKLY AND DISAPPEARED, ALL THIS OCCURRING IN A CURTAIN OF LIGHT SUSPENDED BETWEEN THE UFO AND THE GROUND BELOW. 
HOWEVER, DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE AND WALKED TOWARD THE STRANGE OBJECT AS FAR AS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET FROM IT. THE OBJECT SUDDENLY EMITTED A BRILLIANT CLUSTER OF LIGHTS OF MANY COLORS WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE A 'DECORATIVE' EFFECT. THESE LIGHTS STOPPED ABOUT 600 FEET, AND MADE A TIGHT CIRCLE IN THE AIR AND SHOT BACK AGAIN AND TILTED FORTY-FIVE DEGREES IN THIS POSITION THE OBJECT WAS NOTCHED LIKE A COGWHEEL, WHOSE INDENTATIONS APPEARED LIKE A SERIES OF CONCENTRIC LUMINOUS CIRCLES. MINUTES LATER THE OBJECT BEGAN TO MOVE, EXECUTING SOME STRANGE MANEUVERS ACROSS THE SKY, SOMETIMES STATIONARY AND AT OTHER TIMES MOVING IN ANY DIRECTION AT HIGH SPEED, BECOMING AT TIMES A SMALL DOT OF LIGHT ITSELF AND ALMOST DISAPPEARING, THEN REAPPEARING LARGER AND BRIGHTER AGAIN. 
IT WAS GONE. THE TIME WAS 4:55 A.M. ABOUT TWO MONTHS LATER, AT A LOW ALTITUDE, THE SAME OR SIMILAR OBJECT WAS OBSERVED BY SEVERAL PERSONS IN THE SAME AREA. AFTER SOME MANEUVERS AND AT TREMENDOUS SPEED AND VANISHED IN A SPLIT SECOND.
