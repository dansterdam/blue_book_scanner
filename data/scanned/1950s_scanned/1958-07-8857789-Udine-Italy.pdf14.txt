Based on the image provided, there does not appear to be any photograph present. The image shows a typed document that appears to be part of a Project Blue Book report.

The text in the document states:

"The incident on July 15, 1958 wherein two delivery men and a car attendant at a bus passenger station reported that two glowing red fireballs seemed to soar silently across the sky, hovered for a few moments over O'Hare International Airport, and then shot away like rockets."

The document also states that the Air Force files do not reveal a sighting in the Desplaines, Illinois area on July 19, 1958. Instead, there was a report of a balloon sighting in the Crystal Lake area of Illinois on that date.
