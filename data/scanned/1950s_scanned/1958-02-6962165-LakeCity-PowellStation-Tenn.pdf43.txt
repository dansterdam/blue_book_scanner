The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a document describing project activities related to UFO observations and communications.

hand-in-hand with the "Relative Position Grid" it is felt that this method of "visualization" committee of the I.C.I. to all observing teams, which allows these observers with the indication of our special predictions messages, to produce for themselves "maps" giving the same more information which our regular maps would otherwise supply.

Supplied by the channels of communication by the Civil Air Patrol, we have been aided in getting these predictions communicated to the American Radio Relay League.

When the last visibility period began on February 27, we started sending these predictions to the Civil Air Patrol broadcasting stations, and they in turn are now sending these predictions to the Civil Air Patrol Stations, across the country. These predictions were issued initially for the full visibility period until 18 March 27. During the subsequent period of no visibility, 18 March 27 to 1 April 2,, these predictions necessarily discontinued as they would have no effect.

These three areas of activity, then, are the means by which we have to date attempted to supplement the military's and Air Force's attempts in order to get the needed information to observing teams and the very latest information, on time. We have had an encouraging measure of success in this area, and anticipate further benefits from these efforts.
