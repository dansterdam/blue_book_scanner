The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely a Project Blue Book report, that describes an observation of an unidentified flying object (UFO) that occurred in Washington, Georgia on October 12, 1959.

Here is the text extracted from the document:

house by a substance gave the following account
of what she first observed. It was moving from east to west. The substance
was a stream of illusive substance traveling behind which
seemed to leave as the vapor from a jet plane. In the
distance it appeared to change in color from a bright white to
black in color and at no time veered (veered) from the
course.

(2) The residence of Washington, Georgia. Objects were
observed at about 1400 hours 12 October 1959.

1. Eighteen (18) miles northeast of Washington,
Georgia on Highway 78. Objects were noticed at about 1500
hours 12 October 1959.

At about 1500 hours 12 October 1959, while working in the rear of his residence located on Grove Street in
Washington, Georgia, he observed on the grass of his
lawn two (2) white or gray streaks, approximately 8 inches
wide and ten (10) feet long, extending east to west.
He did not see the object but Sgt. Hamerick
Hamerick stated that he observed the streaks for a few
moments, concluded that they were a fungas of mold,
and moved across them. As the lawn mower went over
the streaks, a spray dust rose into the air for about (20)
inches. The spray particles were carried to the north rapidly. Samples
of the dirt in Sgt Hamerick's yard, and grass from his
lawn mower, were taken for chemical analysis by Mr.
Hamerick is presently being analyzed.

On 14 October 1959, Mr. William Sheppard, Supervisor
Chemistry, APGC, reported that the samples obtained
from Sgt. Hamerick's yard contained silver halide micro-
crystals - a substance analylize of the samples has not
been completed as of the date of this report.
