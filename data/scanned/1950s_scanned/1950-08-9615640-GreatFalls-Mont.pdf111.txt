The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a memorandum from the Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

12 February 1959

MEMORANDUM FOR ASSISTANT DEPUTY, SCIENCE AND COMPONENTS  

SUBJECT: UFO FILM  

1. The film "UFO" referenced in the attached letter was produced by the Green-Rouse Studios and released in 1956. Major Dewey Fournet, Jr., Case Officer Special Photographic Lab, Air Force Photo Group all were hired as technical advisers, but none had connection with the facts in any official capacity as the entire matter was handled informally as the film's producers took part.

2. The film of cases incorporated as a part of this picture was obtained from the original sources. (The "Madden Case") was not a part of this film. (The Air Force had no connection with the release of this film.)

3. A short summary of the two cases follows:  

Case
Time - 1130
Date - 15 August 1950
Place - Great Falls, Montana

A civilian and his secretary were out to inspect a bell which they could not move. This also led to a sighting of the objects with his reverse burret type 16MM camera.

The objects in this case were analyzed on a 7x7 gray-scale similarity analysis to the known air force film analysis. The sightings were found to be in the area at the time, filmulated, and unmistakable analysis was strikingly similar to the air force film.
