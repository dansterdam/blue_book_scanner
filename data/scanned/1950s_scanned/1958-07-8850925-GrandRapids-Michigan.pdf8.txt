MEMORANDUM FOR: Captain Matson - AFCIN-4B3B

SUBJECT: General Orbital-Track Checks for Air Sciences Division.

This office has received a number of UFO reports from GOC posts in The Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Minnesota areas. A cursory check discloses that these are primarily sightings by high school students now on vacation and elder people in that area. Their reliability is obvious. However, would appreciate if a check for detailed file could be made on the following observed in that area:

a. Time: Between 2120 to 2140 hours (local).
b. Date: 12 July 1958.
c. General direction: SSW to ENE.
d. UFO appearance: Very small, white and round.

Just received UFO report from Air Attache, France - there were four military observers. Basic data:

a. Place: NE France (50 N - 4 E).
b. Time: 2127 Z (GMT for that area considered O. Therefore, local time same as GMT).
c. Date: 11 July 1958.
d. General direction: 130 - 190 degrees to 4,050 degrees estimate. i.e. generally SW to NE.
e. Appearance: Round, white. In sight approximately one minute.

Your comments and results of your computations may be hand written on this memorandum. Would appreciate it if you could give us a call.
