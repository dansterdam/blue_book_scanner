Victorville, California  
13 February 1953  
2nd Lt. J. T. Lukens Jr., Asst Intel Officer  
The witness, a civilian, reported that at 10:00p.m. on 10 February 1953, two (2) unusual objects appeared to be silver balls in the sky, as seen from the witness's backyard. They appeared to obtain pictures of the objects by using their camera but subsequent film development failed to show conclusive evidence of this object. This film from the camera was forwarded to ATIC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio, for technical analysis.
