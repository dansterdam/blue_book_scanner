HARLINGEN, TEXAS - More evidence of strange objects in the sky is available this week as a result of the report received by the Air Force from the Sioux City, Iowa Airport.
A civilian pilot, Captain E. S. Lewis, apparently saw a strange object in the sky over Sioux City, Iowa, Friday afternoon, January 5, 1951, shortly after 1:30 P.M.
The report received from the Sioux City Airport was forwarded to the Air Force which is investigating the incident as part of Project Blue Book. The Air Force report states that Captain Lewis was flying at an altitude of approximately 4,000 feet when he sighted the object.
The object which Captain Lewis observed was described as being approximately 50 feet in diameter, disc-shaped, and having a silver color. The object was observed for about 20 minutes as it seemed to hover and then moved rapidly away.
No sound was heard by Captain Lewis as the object left the area. The object was also observed by a number of other people on the ground in the Sioux City area. Their reports generally agreed with the description given by Captain Lewis.
This sighting adds to the growing body of evidence of strange objects in the sky which have been reported in various parts of the United States and other countries in recent months. The Air Force has been investigating all reports as part of its Project Blue Book and has stated that so far no definite conclusions have been reached. The reports continue to come in, however, and there is still much speculation and discussion concerning these mysterious objects which have been observed.
