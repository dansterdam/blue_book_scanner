Is this all. Did you see the one in the sky? It was flying. It stayed down. It moved a little. It moved about again. Do you see anything else? I said, you could see it well. I got so I could see it now and then. It would go out of sight for a while and then come back again. It looked something like a star as it went down. It seemed a little larger than a star. I watched it for about 15 or 20 minutes and it stayed in the same general area all the time. That's the only thing I saw. I was by myself at the time. What would you say the chances are of my having seen something really unusual? Did you see any glowing or anything? No, there was no glow. It just seemed like a star that moved around a little. Do you think it could have been any kind of regular aircraft? No, it didn't seem like any aircraft I ever saw. And the color - was there any change in the color at any time, from white to blue? No, I didn't notice any change in color at all. I just saw one object and that's all. Thank you, sister.
