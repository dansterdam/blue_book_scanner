NAVY BALLOON FLIGHT DELAYED

RAPID CITY, S.D.-(AP) - A Navy balloon flight from Sioux falls, scheduled for today, has been postponed at least one day, Capt. Norman Barr said.

The Navy medical officer said the flight was postponed when it was found the weather conditions would worsen.

Prevlously, General Mills and the Navy sponsored the flight which was to carry Capt. M. L. Lewis and Lt. M. D. Ross.

Winds up to 40 miles an hour and blowing snow forced the postponement of the launching of the plastic balloon which was to be made on the first good weather conditions, Barr said.
