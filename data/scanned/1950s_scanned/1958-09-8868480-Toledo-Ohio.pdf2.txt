Gentlemen:

On September 8, 1958, about 6:30 PM, it was brought to my attention by the neighborhood children that there was a bright glowing object in the sky.

This object stayed stationary for approximately two minutes from the time it was first observed. It then suddenly turned and started traveling in a southerly direction and disappeared from sight.

Suddenly this object seared straight upward, turned black and left a small white trail behind. It then made a sharp angle turn and disappeared out of sight.

I took the enclosed photographs just before the object disappeared out of sight. It appears to be a small bright spot followed by a white trail of vapor. I have encircled the object with a white circle so that it is more distinctive. The object was white in color.

I am passing these photographs on to you for whatever information they may serve.

Sincerely,
Pamela A. Rowe
