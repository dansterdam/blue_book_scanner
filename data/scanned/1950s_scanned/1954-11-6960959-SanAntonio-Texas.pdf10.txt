The provided image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, possibly from Project Blue Book. The text on the page is heavily redacted, with large portions blacked out. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the visible text found in the document:

UNCLASSIFIED
STATUS OF SIGHTING: UNIDENTIFIED
COMMENT UPON INVESTIGATOR'S CONCLUSIONS:
2. THE WITNESS HAS STATED THAT HE ATTEMPTED TO FOLLOW THE OBJECT BUT LOST SIGHT OF IT BEHIND SOME CLOUDS. HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT INDICATES THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A CONVENTIONA AIRCRAFT OR METEOR. THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO MAKE A POSITIVE DETERMINATION AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE OBJECT.
