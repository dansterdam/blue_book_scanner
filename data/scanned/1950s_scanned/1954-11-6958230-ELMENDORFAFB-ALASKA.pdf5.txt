PROJECT NO* 10073-ELMENDORF AFB, ALASKA 
DATE: 6 NOVEMBER 1954
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS SIGHTED OVER ELMENDORF AIR FORCE BASE

The following information was obtained from Lt. Col. WILLIAM L. HARPER, 64th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska:

1. On 6 November 1954 at approximately 1800 hours, ALASKAN AIRCRAFT CONTROL AND WARNING SQUADRON radar observation revealed two unidentified aerial objects traveling at extremely high speeds over Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. 

2. The objects were observed for a period of approximately 10 minutes by radar operators at the Elmendorf Control and Warning Station.  The objects were described as moving at an estimated speed of 1800 to 2400 miles per hour and at an average altitude of approximately 38,000 feet.

3. Ground observers at Elmendorf AFB also observed the objects visually during the period they were under radar observation.  The objects were described as being red to orange in color and following extremely erratic flight patterns.

4. No attempt was made to intercept the objects as the Air Defense Command at Elmendorf had no aircraft capable of matching their speed.

5. A detailed interrogation of all personnel involved has been conducted and their reports have been forwarded to the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for evaluation and analysis.
