STATEMENT
AACS DETACHMENT, LAREDO AFB
ON 9 NOV 52 AT 19 39 792, A MEMBER OF THE 1923-9 AACS DETACHMENT, LAREDO AFB, WAS ON DUTY AS CONTROLLER IN THE RADAR APPROACH CONTROL ROOM AT LAREDO AFB. IT APPEARED TO BE A WHITISH-GRAY OBJECT WHICH WAS TRAVELING AT A VERY HIGH SPEED; IT DID SEEM BELOW THE ESTIMATED HEIGHT OF APPROXIMATELY FOUR (4) THOUSAND FEET. I CANNOT ESTIMATE THE DIMENSIONS BUT IT APPEARED TO BE LARGE AND CYLINDRICAL. THE OBJECT APPEARED IN THE SOUTHEAST TRAVELING NORTHWEST. NORMALLY VISION OF THE OBJECT IS OBSCURED BY INTERVENING WINDMILL AND HIGH TENSION WIRE STRUCTURE. I ESTIMATE THE OBJECT WAS IN SIGHT 2 OR 3 SECONDS. AT THE TIME THE OBJECT WAS IN SIGHT, THERE WAS JUST TURNED INITIAL ABOUT FOUR (4) MILES SOUTH OF THE FIELD FOR LANDING ON RUNWAY 29R. AFTER THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED, I CALLED THE PILOT OF THE F-33 ON INITIAL IF HE HAD SEEN ANYTHING BECAUSE I WAS NOT SURE WHETHER THE OBJECT HAD PASSED IN FRONT OF OR BEHIND THE JET. I AM CERTAIN THAT THIS OBJECT WAS NOT A KNOWN TYPE OF AIRCRAFT. TRAFFIC CONTROLLER ADVISED ME THAT THE WHITISH-GRAY COLOR AND CYLINDRICAL OUTLINE DID NOT RESEMBLE ANY OF THE T-28'S FLYING THAT NIGHT. I DID NOT CONFUSE THIS OBJECT WITH ANY OF THE T-28'S FLYING THAT NIGHT.
