The image provided does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document discussing observations related to an unidentified flying object (UFO). The text in the document is as follows:

shall soon prove, according to what I actually saw.
At this point, let us consider facts and straight logic.
We are given to understand, by the astronomers, that the
mean distance of the Moon, from the Earth, is two hundred 
and forty thousand miles. We are also given to understand
that the Moon is one-sixth the size of the Earth. Therefore,
if an object other than the Moon, seen at the same distance
from the Earth as the Moon, appears almost as large as the
Moon itself, are we to conclude that such an object must
then be approximately one-sixth the size of the Earth in
size?
Perhaps, it should be taken into consideration that what
appeared to be a shield of red metal, or some other red
material was used to reflect the sun's light and heat. Of
course, unlike the Earth, a space ship would not have all
the protective layers of atmosphere, consisting of tropo-
sphere, stratosphere, aurora, and ionosphere layers around
it and it is reasonable to assume that, without a powerful
reflector, it would burst into flame and rendered to ashes
in space. This reflector, however, could very well cause
the object it protects to appear larger than it actually
is and could also make it, at such a great distance, away.
These round like a saucer. As I shall explain later, these
objects under discussion were not found, but some. A careful study of our moon seemed to have been the object of the
visit. With the kind of knowledge and skill the travelers
in these ships must have, judging by the smoothness of the
whole operation, the unbelievable speed, the great size of
the object, we should soon prove, according to what I actually saw.
