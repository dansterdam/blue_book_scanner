The image does not contain any photographs, but rather two sketches. 

The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" and "B" marked on it, illustrating how high an object was above the horizon (skyline) when first seen and then later observed.

The second sketch contains two smaller drawings. The larger one depicts a person standing on a road with mountains in the background, while the smaller one shows a landscape with a curved horizon line.
