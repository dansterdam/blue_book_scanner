FILE CLASS: 
OFFICIAL FILE CO:
OFFICE OF RECORD

12 FEB 1958

SUBJECT: (U) Aids to Identification of Flying Objects
ATTN: Col F.W. McDuffee
U.S.A.F. PRTC 100
New York, New York

Attached is a draft copy of a proposed "Identification to UFO" which includes one and revisions. One or more illustrations to be added to the draft are forwarded.

Subject material is forwarded in accordance with an informal request made to Captain Gregory or this office. The material is similar to that used by Headquarters USAF for the identification of UFOs and related by this Office.

Because of current budgetary limitations and manpower restrictions, production and dissemination of this project guide, on a USAF-wide basis, within the near future is unlikely. Therefore, the material may be used by you as a master for the preparation of a document to guide to be assembled by your office in any format desired or as disseminated by your own information or operations.

It should be stated, as a matter of guidance, that a large number of reports received from various commands and facilities could have been resolved by a check and investigation of local phenomena at the source as prescribed in par. 5, AFR 200-2.

Also attached is Department of Defense and other material re-questing the work, findings and other aspects on the Air Force "UFO Project." This is together with the recommended guide, should provide the necessary for training, indoctrination or informative purposes.
