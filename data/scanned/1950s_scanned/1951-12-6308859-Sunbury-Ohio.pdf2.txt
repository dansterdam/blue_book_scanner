The image contains a photograph showing a farmer observing a "weird sphere, odd lights, [and] cloud" through a telescope. The caption below the photograph states "CARL LOAR WITH HIS TELESCOPE" and describes his observation of the unidentified objects on December 7.

The text in the document reads as follows:

Weird Sphere, Odd Lights, Cloud Seen by Farmer with Telescope

A "group of weird, shining odd-shaped objects" which appeared at a tremendous altitude above the earth was observed by Carl Loar, of Rt. 2, Sunbury, Ohio, on the evening of Dec. 7, according to his observation, which he swears is true.

It was about 9:45 p. m. on Dec. 7, said Loar, when he first saw the objects through his telescope. They were shining, silvery spheres, he said, moving at high speed and flashing lights. He watched them for about 15 minutes, he said, and they suddenly darted outside the field of his telescope. There seemed to be a dozen or more of the strange objects, Loar reported.

There really isn't much more to tell about Carl Loar's story. Those are the main details as he has reported them.
