REPORT BY U- S. WEATHER BUREAU METEOROLOGIST OF LIGHT SEEN IN PILOT BALLOON OBSERVATION THEODOLITE.

During the rr-galar aftetncon plio: balloon observation taken en August 7, 1952, a small bright light appeared in the theodolite. The light an viewed in the theodolite eyepiece was approximately one twentieth inch long and aboit half as high ac air- long. Ite third dimension could not be observed. Its color was the color of suntieht I do not know when the light moved into, or criginate on, the field of vieion. Due to its small sini it was noticed only by acuidente

In following the drift of the balloon the movement of the theodclite caused the small bright light to move ta the edge of the field of vision. Since I wanted to keep the light in the field of vision I let the balloon pass out cf the field and I brought the small bright light back to the ceater of the field. There appeared to be no movement of the light during the minute when I had it centered in the theodolite vield. Its azimath angle rounded at 237.5 degrees, and the elevation angle ae 22,0 degrees.

i have rs ectinste to give concerning the actual size of the object, ur of its distance frem this station.

In attempting to fulfill ny purpose of observing (the pilot balloon) I goved the theodclite to the position where I expected to find the balloon. Then I iThnediately noved it back to 237.5 azimuth and 22.0 degrees elevation. However; I then could not find the light. I nctuslly observed the light for sorowhat nore than two minutes from 1505 to 1508 CST.

Winds aloft computed from this observation, given in thousands of feet MSL, degrees from North, and in knots mere; 2-00-7, 2-220-10, 1-2io-12, 1-250-10, 2520-10, 7-250-5, 2-610-2, 2-520-23, 1-2 20-12, 1-220-12, 15-20-15, 130-25-15,

I do not know wthether this light was reflected from some object, or if it had its own source of light. The light was shimmering and bright, but not dannling. 1t was bright enough so that I could not dafine its borders.

Since noving the theodolite caused the light to move across the field of vision I know that the light was not caused by any flaw in any part of the instrument.

No publicity vas given the observing of this phenomenon.
