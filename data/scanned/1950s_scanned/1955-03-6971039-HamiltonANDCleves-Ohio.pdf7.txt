There is no photograph present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The text on the page appears to be a questionnaire or form with various questions related to the observation of an unidentified object.

Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, or "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension: 2 - 3 feet.

How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand (Circle One):
a. Head of a pin  b. Pen  c. Dime  d. Nickel  e. Quarter  f. Half dollar

Indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22: a. Certain  b. Fairly certain  c. Not very sure  d. Uncertain

How did the object or objects disappear from view? Gradually faded from sight.

In order that you can give us a clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you see. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which would be the same appearance as the object which you saw.
