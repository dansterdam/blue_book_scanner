Other towers & friend spotted this object as it was caught by some going down. Definite silver-brilliance - smoothly observed by several people on the contrary cliff. Object is related to nothing seen or known of the size of our.

We checked this object very carefully - many unusual and unexplainable characteristics. Distinct circular-horizon related - certain to attract an interest. On noting, some very strange phenomena indicated that the object was real and relative speed was almost unbelievably fast. Very strange was the attitude and motion of this object as described by the observers.
