These eight-column headlines are only a sample of what appeared all over the national press during the 1957 "Flap" of unidentified flying objects. Many months have passed--two of them artificial (as of this writing)--since the press has displayed much open interest in UPC analysis that they describe

Following hard on the announcement of the launching of "Sputnik"--whether by coincidence or not--there developed into a sharpfocused national interest in UFCs that is still continuing. Several instances of truck drivers, state and local police, and other residents describing seeing a mysterious object that reportedly hovered over highways, stalled car motors and headlights. This effect on automobiles had previously been reported in earlier UPC incidents.

Newsmen, police officers, made a tour of the areas where the object(s) had been encountered. At Levelland, Texas, five automobile drivers and a college student reported close encounters with an object described as bright, egg-shaped and silent as it hovered above their stalled cars. At least seven persons reported close encounters with the bright, silent object in the sky over the highway near Levelland.

Newsmen at least seven other locations where similar encounters were alleged to have occurred. 

The above headlines are from the Albuquerque, N.M. Daily News, 11/5; the Ramo nd, Ind., Times, 11/11; and the Los Angeles Times, 11/6.
