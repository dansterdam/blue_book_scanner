The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document. There is no photograph present on this page, only a simple sketch of an oval-shaped object with an arrow next to it. The text on the page asks the observer to describe various details about the object, such as its sound, color, and the edges/shape of the object. The observer is also instructed to draw a picture showing the shape and direction of the object. Based on the context provided, this appears to be a form or questionnaire used to gather information about UFO sightings.
