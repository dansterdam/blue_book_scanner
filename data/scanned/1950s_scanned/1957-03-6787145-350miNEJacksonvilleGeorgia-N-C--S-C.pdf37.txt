The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typewritten document describing an incident involving a "brilliant greenish-white object" that was observed by the crew and passengers of a Pan American Airlines flight from New York to Puerto Rico. The document mentions that the object was described as resembling a "huge glaring spotlight" and that two other airlines also observed the object at the same time. The analysis concludes that the object was a "seldom seen form of meteor, a bolide, commonly referred to as a 'firebolt'," based on the description provided by the crew and passengers.

Now, acting as an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

At approximately 3 o'clock in the morning, the pilot of an airliner from New York to Porto Rico, pulled up and over sharply to avoid colliding with a "brilliant greenish-white object" that suddenly appeared in his path. The pilot and co-pilot described it as resembling a huge glaring spotlight. A number of passengers were injured during the violent maneuvers and required hospitalization.

The fact that two other airlines approximately 175 miles away observed the object at the same time ruled out aircraft and missiles. This was later confirmed by all military and civil agencies. From a description given by the crew and passengers who happened to see the object, the Center concluded that the object was a seldom seen form of meteor, a bolide, commonly referred to as a "firebolt". The analysis was independently reviewed and concurred with by a well known astrophysicist now with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Dr. J. Allen Hynek.
