The UFO Investigation
Still Unsolved, Says CAB

The Civil Aeronautics Board issued a report on an investigation by the CAB into a reported sighting of an unidentified flying object by the crew of an American airliner over the southeastern United States on March 6, 1957. The CAB report states that the object was seen for about 20 minutes and that the crew felt it was a real, solid object which was not a meteor, star, planet or aircraft. The CAB concluded that the object was not positively identified and the case was still unsolved.

The report states that at 8:15 PM on March 6, 1957, an American Airlines flight from Richmond, Virginia to Miami, Florida encountered an unidentified flying object about 350 miles northeast of Jacksonville, Florida. The object was first seen by the co-pilot and then observed by the pilot and two stewardesses on the flight. 

According to the report, the object appeared to be round, glowing, and was estimated to be about 40-50 feet in diameter. It was observed for about 20 minutes and was estimated to be about 10-15 miles away from the aircraft. The object appeared to change color from red to orange to white during the observation period. 

The report states that the crew felt the object was a real, solid object that was not a meteor, star, planet or aircraft. The CAB investigation concluded that the object was not positively identified and the case remained unsolved.
