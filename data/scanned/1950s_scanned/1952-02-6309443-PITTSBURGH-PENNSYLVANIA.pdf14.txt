APPENDIX IV
Washington, D.C. Area - 12 February 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On 12 February 1952, two USAF pilots flying a C-47 on a local flight observed a bright white object which appeared to be 7,500 ft. and about one-sixth the size of a rising moon.
The object was observed twice. The first time at 2030 EST, the C-47 was between Baltimore and Washington and altitude of 7,500 ft. The object was estimated to be about 3 miles away, very bright and disappeared southwest of Washington, D.C.
The second time the object was observed was at about 2100 EST, the C-47 was south of Baltimore at an altitude of 7,500 ft. The object appeared to approach Washington from the south and east, making a left turn toward the city. When it was within 2-3 miles of Washington, it appeared to hover for about one minute and then it disappeared.
In both instances the object was observed for two or three minutes.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
The description of this incident is very similar to the one reported on 23 December 1951 that proved to be a helicopter carrying experimental lighting.
CONCLUSIONS:
None.
