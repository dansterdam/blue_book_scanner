civilian defense people whom he knows quite well, to Hays Landing, and several other places which appear to have been South of the position of these objects, and who might have been able to furnish information as to what they looked like from that angle. None of these people had any information whatever on this incident, and it was quite definite that if any observations had been made, the people contacted would have known about it. 

The last piece of evidence I would like to bring in varies a great deal from all the other observations. Lt./Jg. a pilot who lives near Toms River, was contacted by a friend that night to go on a sky watch. They continued to observe the unknown objects and considered of above average reliability and an above average observer. He saw 12 objects. He observed them for 5 minutes, during which time he says they were flying in a left-hand circle formation. (He has drawn this on his Form A.) Their color was orange, their shape was round or slightly oval, they would stand still at times and then would speed up, always keeping in the circle. He estimates their speed at between 2 and 3 thousand mph, and their distance at 23 miles at 2000' or 70 miles at 50 - 60 thousand feet. When we contacted again at Lakehurst NAS, Capt. Hanson asked him if he had any further information to add, either as to additional data gathered or in the way of opinions on the subject. He replied that he had no further information not stated on the Form A, and that if we wanted any opinions, that was just too bad, as he didn't want to "tend to in a straight-jacket." This same general type of opinion was voiced by all the other observers. That is, that these objects were frightening, awesome, that they were glad when they went away, and they don't want to ever see them again.
