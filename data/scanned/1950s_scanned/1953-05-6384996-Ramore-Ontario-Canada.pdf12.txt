STATEMENT

At approximately 0415, 25 May 1953, 4 airman and myself were returning from a trip to the radar station in Ramore. As we were turning onto the road under the control of the Ramore Service Station, a call was called attention to it and the other 4 airman agreed that it was not a tower light or a star with some unusual coloring. The object appeared to be low on the horizon and the object started to move and move toward the radar tower. We drove up to the base gate (already stopping near the object). As we arrived the object started to go away from the radar tower. We informed the A.D. at the gate about it and then proceeded to the radar tower. As we turned up toward the hill, the object started to go away from the radar tower, when we arrived on the radar tower the object disappeared into the clouds.
