UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT ()
SUBJECT: Sighting of Unusual Object
LOCATION: 17 United States (Spokane, Washington)
DATE-TIME GROUP: 23 January 1952 - 30 January 1952
OBSERVERS: NAMED PERSON -/- ORGANIZATION: SSgt Harry M. Cavanaugh, 2nd Lt. Robert W. Holt
DESCRIPTION OF UNUSUAL OBJECT: At approximately 0500 hours on 23 January 1952, while on routine security patrol, SSgt Harry M. Cavanaugh and 2nd Lt. Robert W. Holt observed an unidentified brilliant object in the sky. According to their statements, the object was brilliantly illuminated, traveling very rapidly from east to west, and at the distance from where they stood it appeared to be slightly larger than the cockpit of a jet aircraft.
The object left a blue trail which was broken. The trail appeared to be coming from the object's exhaust. The height of the object was estimated by a ground light to be approximately 1000 feet on Fairchild Air Force Base. The object was projected vertically in a stationary position, the flying object traveling parallel to the earth.
Sergeant Barnes was behind Sergeant Holt and me and did not see the object.
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER: A sighting of the type described is of particular interest to the Wing Intelligence Section, and since the sighting was witnessed by another person, this report appears well-founded.
