AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DATE: 15 May 1952
PLACE: Corner Brook, Newfoundland
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

The text of the document is as follows:

The conclusions of this report have been classified 'UNCLASSIFIED' since in the opinion of those concerned no security information is involved.

The undersigned, based on the contents of this report, considered the possibilities of reported events indicating the following:

1. That the incident concerned was a military aircraft on a secret mission or test flight. This appears to be unlikely as no known aircraft of this type was reported to be in the area at the time.

2. That the incident concerned the presence of a natural phenomenon in the sky. This appears unlikely on the basis of the details and descriptions contained in the report.

3. That the incident concerned the presence of an unidentified flying object. This possibility seems the most likely on the basis of the available evidence.

Accordingly, we are unable to attribute the observations, which have been described, to any known or logical explanation. The complete lack of substantiating data on the part of the observers, however, makes it impossible to arrive at any definite conclusion.

We respectfully suggest that all means for investigating this incident be exhausted. It is considered that the determination of the true nature of this incident be given urgent and thorough attention.
