CSAF ITEM 4/CONFIDENTIAL
SECURITY INFO

TO: ATIAA-2C RUPPELT PM FOURNET
REFERENCE CSAF ITEM 6, TT 53, LAST PART.
MRS. BARBER, AID, INFORMED ME THIS MORNING
THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TO YOU REGARDING AF
42235551 AND THAT YOU HAD INDICATED THAT THE 
IMAGES WERE MADE WITH AN ELECTRIC NEEDLE.
IF THIS IS CONCLUSIVE, THEN THERE APPEAR TO
BE SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS SINCE THE FILM AND
REPORT WERE TURNED IN BY AN AIR FORCE OFFICER.
THEREFORE, IF YOUR EVALUATION OF THE ORIGIN
OF THESE IMAGES IS WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY
OF A DOUBT, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU CONTACT
THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICER OF THE FIRST STRATEGIC
SUPPORT SQUADRON IMMEDIATELY TO DETERMINE
WHETHER CAPTAIN MUSICK DEVELOPED THE FILM
HIMSELF OR HAD IT DEVELOPED BY A CIVILIAN
OR MILITARY LAB. IF HE DEVELOPED IT HIMSELF,
OR IF IT WAS DEVELOPED BY A MILITARY LAB,
IT APPEARS THAT DISCIPLINARY ACTION WILL
BE INVOLVED FOLLOWING A REPORT OF OUR FIND-
INGS TO THE CO OF THE FIRST STRATEGIC SUPPORT
SQUADRON. REQUEST THAT YOU EXPLORE ALL OF
THESE POSSIBILITIES AND WE WILL DISCUSS IT
FURTHER WHEN I ARRIVE AT ATIC NEXT WEEK.

END CSAF ITEM 4/CONFIDENTIAL
