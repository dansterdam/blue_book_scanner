SUBJ: Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program
1. In the fall of 1947, the USAF took official notice of reports of
unidentified flying objects. Responsibility for the UFO project was
assigned to the intelligence community.
2. The project, as established, was to determine if UFO's were hostile,
had any positive scientific value, and to determine the nature of each of
these objects. After 12 years and more than 5000 reports, the Air Force
has not discovered any evidence which would indicate that UFO's are
hostile or pose a security threat in any way.
3. In the absence of evidence to indicate a possible security threat the
scientific and public relations aspects of the program gained stature. It
became obvious that with these new objectives the program that its
assignment to intelligence is no longer practical. Experience during the
same 12 years has indicated that the program is more a public relations
program than anything else. The few reports that may have intelligence
and/or scientific and technical value have a tendency to become lost in
the volumes of UFO traffic. In an effort to overcome this shortcoming,
it is my opinion that the aerial phenomena project should be assigned
to SAFOI.
4. To prevent the loss of valuable information, intelligence, scientific,
and/or technical, it is suggested that an individual with a technical and
intelligence background be assigned to the branch or SAFOI which becomes
responsible for the program. All reports which have indication of value
in the intelligence and/or scientific areas would be routed to the appropriate agency for exploitation.
5. With your concurrence, I propose to initiate the action to transfer
the Aerial Phenomena Program to SAFOI.
