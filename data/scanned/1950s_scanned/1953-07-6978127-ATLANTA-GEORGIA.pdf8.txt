Martian Is A Monkey 
ATLANTA. July 6--(AP)--The aerial saucer or unidentified flying object which was observed over Atlanta last night, according to a newspaper report, was apparently a monkey belonging to an Atlanta resident. The report stated that the object which was seen by witnesses was an object resembling a saucer or disc which hovered over the city and then disappeared. It was stated that the object seemed to move too slowly to be an airplane and appeared to be controlled by some kind of intelligence. However, it was later determined that the object which was seen was a monkey belonging to a resident of Atlanta which had escaped from its cage and was floating through the air supported by a cluster of balloons to which it was attached. The monkey was said to have been highly trained and was used for exhibition purposes. It was apparently the monkey which was misidentified as a flying saucer or unidentified aerial object. There was no evidence found to indicate that the object was an extraterrestrial spacecraft or anything other than the escaped monkey supported by balloons.
