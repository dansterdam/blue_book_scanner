The image does not contain any photographs, only a diagram. The diagram appears to be an illustration of the motion or path of an object or objects, as requested in question 20 of the document.

Now, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and transcribe all the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

31. If POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and as about 6 inches in length?
Circle One:
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea 
c. Dime
d. Grapefruit
e. Baseball
f. Grapefruit
g. Orange
h. Silver dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22.
a. Very certain
b. Fairly certain
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could not only describe the object that you saw, but what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it be? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
