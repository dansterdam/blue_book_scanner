SECTION B

26. Was this the first time that you have seen an object like this? (Circle one): YES NO

26.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what conditions did you see other cases?

27. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it? It was obviously not a meteor because it was in a level flight and not descending rapidly. I suppose for want of a better explanation it could have been a disc of some kind, but it was not a reflection as it was clearly defined brilliantly visible at the same time to the southwest of the point of sighting, and remained there for something of the order of 10 or 15 minutes.

28. Give the following information about yourself:
