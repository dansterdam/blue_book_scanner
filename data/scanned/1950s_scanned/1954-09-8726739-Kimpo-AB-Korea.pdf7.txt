**AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT**

**4th Fighter Interceptor Group Intelligence APO 75 
11- 54**

At approximately 0557i1, 19 September 1954 (2077i1 13 September 1954), Base Weather telephoned the tower and asked me to look towards the south to an object in the sky (a bright white light that resembled a star). I confirmed the object, so they asked me to look at it through the binoculars. I looked at the object through the binoculars and told them that it didn’t look like a star to me because it was much brighter and it appeared to be moving in a westerly direction. Weather asked that I also get the object to be watched. I asked them if it could be a weather balloon they said that it couldn’t be a balloon because it was moving in the wrong direction. I then called Combat Operations and gave them the above information. I continued to look through the binoculars until the object disappeared above clouds at about 060ost. I would estimate that the object was at about 175 azimuth degrees from the tower. It appeared to be at a very high altitude and at about 50 degrees elevation. Through the binoculars no streamers, tail, or specific structure could be seen, only a bright white light, similar to bright sunlight reflected by an aluminum surface. With the binoculars, the object appeared to be about the size of a pin-head.

At 0557i4 19 September 1954, the control tower received a telephone call from the Base Weather Section stating that weather personnel had under observation a bright object in the sky. The man on the telephone then went to the window with binoculars (7:50 power) to observe the object. He then pointed out the object to me and handed me the binoculars. I observed the object through the binoculars. The object was very bright, too bright to make out any specific shape or dimensions or to estimate its altitude. I then went out on the roof of the tower with the edge of the roof and the bright object. I kept this position for a minute and a half, during which the object appeared to be standing still. During that period clouds were moving rapidly from the west, giving the object an apparent motion in relation to the clouds. I then went back into the tower for a couple of minutes, and then went out and again visually lined up the roof edge with the object. The object appeared to have moved, but only slightly. The sky was clouding up very rapidly and at 060ost the object was obscured by clouds at about 180 degrees azimuth.
