The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a UFO report document that is heavily redacted or blacked out, with the text "UNCLASSIFIED" written at the top and bottom of the page.

The text that can be read from the image is as follows:

The third attempted interest, the one in which the object was followed in a wide turn, cannot be explained.

It is not believed that further investigation would produce any additional significant details due to the fact that some of the personnel involved have been transferred overseas and due to the time since the incident.
