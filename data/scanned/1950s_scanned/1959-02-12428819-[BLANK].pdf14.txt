AFR 200-2 DATED 5 FEBRUARY 1958,
AND CHANGE THERETO DATED 3 JULY 1958

1. This regulation as it stands serves well the purpose for which
it was written. However, the Air Force investigators are doing little
more than meeting the minimum requirements of this document, and in many
instances require prompting by the Air Technical Intelligence Center to
deliver even this minimum date.

2. The shortcomings of the UFO investigation procedures probably
are due mostly to the Air Bases assigning inexperienced and/or unqualified
people to this task, and also to lack of interest in the Program. It is
difficult to become fired up over a Program in which the boss shows little
or no interest.

3. The ATIC proposes the following as a solution to the problems
associated with UFO investigations.

a. Assignment of competent persons as investigators.

b. Short training program for the personnel proposed for use
as investigators. The length of this training program should depend upon
the basic qualifications of the personnel selected. However, it is
suggested that such a training program not exceed twenty (20) hours. In
all instances the program should include hours of instruction on the
following:

(1) History and philosophy of the UFO Program.

(2) Introduction to Astronomy (Basic terminology and
description of the more common astronomical bodies).

(3) Methods of interrogations.

(4) Use of equipment.

(5) Reporting.
