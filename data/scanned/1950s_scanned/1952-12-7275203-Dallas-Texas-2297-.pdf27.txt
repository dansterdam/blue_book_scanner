This page from the Project Blue Book document contains a photograph that appears to show a control panel or instrument display. The image includes a dial or gauge with markings from 0 to 24, as well as a label that says "Act Shippt Fit 78 84 KD Maint Alarm".

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the image:

Act Shippt Fit 78 84 KD Maint Alarm
