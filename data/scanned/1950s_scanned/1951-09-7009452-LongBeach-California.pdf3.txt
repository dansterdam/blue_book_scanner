II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
At 0700 PST a radiosonde balloon was released from the Long Beach Municipal Airport. The balloon which was lost at 0721 PST, sighted from the airport, bearing of 95° true, due to a malfunction and tracking equipment. The point on ground was approximately 40,000 ft. The winds above 10,000 ft. are unknown but it is logical to assume that a constant direction of 270° and an average velocity of 20 knots above 15,000 ft. and 30 knots above 20,000 ft. The balloon was tracked up to 50,000 ft. at which point it disappeared. According to a telemetering constant direction of 270° and an average velocity of 20 knots above 15,000 ft. and 30 knots above 20,000 ft. The balloon was tracked up to 50,000 ft. at which point it disappeared.

Referring to the ground track of Flight 2-A, if a 30 knot wind at 270° is assumed, at 0910, the approximate time the F-86's sighted the object, the balloon would be at an altitude of 46,700 ft. and nearly directly over the aircraft. The altitude of the aircraft at this point was approximately 42,500 ft. It would seem that the balloon could have been mistaken for a strange object. Once again the orbiting of the object cannot be explained.

The attempted intercept by Flight 2-B cannot be explained. If the ground track of the balloon is plotted as indicated, it is correct to assume that the flight was observing a balloon. The time at which they sighted the object is not known. It is highly possible that a wind shift or nearly 360° could occur between the time of the original sighting and the attempt to intercept it, due to the high altitude of the object.

The possibility of this object being an experimental aircraft from overseas appears extremely remote. The case was checked with negative results. No other balloons were observed in the vicinity.

III. CONCLUSION
With the information available, it cannot be concluded that the object was definitely the radiosonde balloon launched at 0700. However, since the balloon was near the flight path of the two aircraft, it can be concluded that the unidentified object observed was possibly the balloon.
