REPORT OF OBSERVER OF UNCONTROLIONAL AIRCRAFT

On Tuesday, 24 Jul 51, while travelling north on U.S. Route 1, near Portsmouth, New Hampshire, I saw an unusual object in the sky. This object was travelling in free the approximately direction and I would say at between 500 and 1000 feet.

Although I could make no estimate regarding the speed of the object, I can say that it was travelling at a considerably greater rate of speed than any other type of aircraft. Although the object was not well defined, it seems possible that it was a large bat-wing type aircraft. However, the shape resembles that of a large bat-wing type aircraft, high altitude photographs of large bat-wing type aircraft.

The object was in my sight for between five and ten seconds and then seemed to disappear from sight, as if into a cloud bank, although there were no clouds in that area.

The time of the sighting was 1910 EST.
