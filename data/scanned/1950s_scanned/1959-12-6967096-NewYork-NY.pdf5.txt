This is to acknowledge your letter of 2 January 1950 regarding the sighting of an unidentified flying object in New York City on 18 December.

Your letter contains insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, I am enclosing an Air Force Questionnaire for you to fill out, when it is completed, please return it to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio for analysis and evaluation.
