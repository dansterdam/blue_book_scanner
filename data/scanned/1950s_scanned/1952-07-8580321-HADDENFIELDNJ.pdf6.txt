At 2215 hours, 16 July 1952, Captain [blurred], acting as Airborne Officer for McGuire Air Force Base, received a telephone call from Mrs. [blurred], Haddenfield, New Jersey. Mrs. [blurred] reported the sighting of a strange unidentified object in the air by her, her husband and three small children.

The object was sighted by the [blurred] family at approximately 2050 hours as they were returning home from a pleasure drive. It was seen for ten to fifteen seconds, disappeared for approximately five seconds, reappeared and was seen for five to ten seconds before its final disappearance. It appeared to be a perfectly round sphere, composed of white light, which had no visible means of propulsion. This object was travelling west to east when suddenly it changed direction and travelled directly north. After its second disappearance, the object was not seen again.

The claims made by Mrs. [blurred] were referred to the 568th Air Base Group Base Investigations and were investigated by S/Sgt Dennis J. Gaburn, Intelligence Operations Technician. His complete report is forwarded.
