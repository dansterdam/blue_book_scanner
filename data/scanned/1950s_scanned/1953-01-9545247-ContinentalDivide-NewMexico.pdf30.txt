The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is as follows:

U.S too high to effect the radar which was tracking the object at 10-12,000 ft. The tracking effect was such a reduction of size as to render the visual sighting casually impossible. There is a possibility which aids to now checking that the sighting described may have been undoubtedly due to the natural phenomena called visual wind. This would account for the interferenc with the radar and visual sightings seen to coincide too exactly to give much weight to the theory that they were accompanied by physical disturbances.

Two other items added to the completeness of this report. ATIG supplied the sighting intelligence reports with a USAF Technical Information Sheet or a visual questionaire and an Electronics Data Sheet. Further analysis of this sighting awaits any limiting of sighting Blue Book files as an interim.

III. Conclusion:
DISAPPROVED FOR OPERATION
