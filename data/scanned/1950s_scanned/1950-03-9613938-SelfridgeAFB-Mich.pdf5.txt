The second experience was as follows: I went on duty as Controller at 1630, 13 March 1950. At 1948 hours a blip was pointed out to me that was at 270째, sixty-eight (68) miles, 40,000 feet (measured by the HRI scope). (Capt. ____________ and I watched this blip and it did not move for three (3) minutes, then faded. At 2002 hours the target was picked up again and it was at 40,000 feet, lateral movement was detected in a northeasterly direction, at this time I estimated the speed at 1,500 m.p.h. At 2006 hours a target appeared at 350째, fifty-eight (58) miles at 45,000 feet. There were four (4) jet aircraft flying in the local area at this time at 24,000 feet and the altitude of the jet aircraft on a bearing of 340째, thirty-eight (38) miles, was checked at 25,000 feet on the HRI scope, the pilot stated that he was flying at 24,000 feet. This lends support of the accuracy of the HRI scope. The strange object faded after one minute. Captain ___________ and Lt ____________ came in and I left the radar scopes.

At 2020 hours I returned to the HRI scope to see an object at 350째, thirty-eight (38) miles climb from 30,000 feet to 45,000 feet in one (1) minute, with no lateral movement detected. I went off duty and left the GCI room at 2025 hours.

On the first occasion it was cloudless, moderately bright moonlight night, with a light haze; on the second occasion, it was clear with unrestricted visibility and no moon.

I am 27 years of age and have been a rated pilot in the USAF since October 1942, having over 2,900 hours flying time. I have had seven (7) months experience as a Radar Controller.
