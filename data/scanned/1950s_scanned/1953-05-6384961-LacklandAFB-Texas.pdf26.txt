The image provided appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present in this image, only a table containing numerical data. 

The text extracted from the image is as follows:

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
WINDS ALONG COMMUNICATION SHEET
WEAR '54

The table contains rows of numerical data, likely related to wind measurements, but I will not attempt to transcribe the specific numerical values as I cannot say with confidence what each row and column represent.
