TO ATIC-2
Attn: Mr. James

1. Enclosed for your review and possible evaluation is a sighting of an unidentified object made at Bergstrom AFB, Texas, by an AN/FPN-1 GCA radar set. Only radar contact was made and no further details were observed.

2. ATIC-2 sent the sighting station a copy of ATIC's Electronics Data Sheet which included thereon will afford a basis for a possible conclusion as to the cause of this sighting.

3. While ATIC-2 realizes the importance of comparing atmospheric conditions, i.e. temperature vs altitude, it can't up to the present time provide these data from the Bergstrom GCA station. It is hoped that ATIC-2 may be able to offer a possible solution in the interim.

TO ATIC-5 FROM ATIC-2 DATE 10 MAR 53 COMMENT NO. 2

1. Preliminary analysis indicates a strong probability that targets were caused by weather conditions, possibly heavy rain clouds or ice-laden clouds.

2. Additional weather data would be of considerable value.
