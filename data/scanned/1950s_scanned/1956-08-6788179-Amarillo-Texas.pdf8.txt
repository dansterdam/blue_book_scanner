MEMORANDUM FOR UFO FILES
SUBJECT: Late Receipt of UFO Reports

1. This batch of six (6) UFO reports submitted under one cover letter by the -46022 ATIC, who received them from the "46022 AIRS" letter dated 26 December 1956, subject: "USCI UFOBS REPORTS".

2. Received by ATIC on 3 January 1957.

3. Reports range from almost two years (February 1954) for the oldest to over 7 months (June 1956). It appears that the USCI had "pigeonholed" the reports for some unknown reason before submitting them to ATIC.

4. The very late date of receipt makes investigations or conclusive analysis extremely difficult, if not impossible. A preliminary evaluation made of each and entered in UFO files.
