"FIAME" REPORTED 
SEEN OVER INDIANA
A "big blue flame" that reportedly passed over New York International Airport, invisible, at 7:25 o'clock last night mystified airport personnel.
The phenomenon was observed in the area by a pilot who reported to the control tower being requested to take off to allow a pilot about to land, control over personnel and some mechanics at the field.
The control tower men, who are employees of the Civil Aeronautics Authority, said they had report to their supervisor to what they had observed. They indicated the object declined to describe what they had seen.
It was learned that the "flame" was reportedly seen traveling at high speed, leaving a trail, and that it had no apparent sound. The pilot over Buffalo was talking to the tower at the time and asked the operators if they saw the "flame". The replied that he had seen something, but at the request of the pilot made a record of the incident.
A spokesman for O.S.I. said later that a controller at the airport told him visual observers had seen an object about 1,500 ft. in height, which the object seemed to have dissipated off the periphery of the airport. In accordance with precedure, he notified military authorities.
