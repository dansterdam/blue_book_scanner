June 1, 1965

Dear Major: 

This is a report on the very old sighting of November 4, 1957, made by two police officers and a fireman riding in one patrol car at shortly after 3:00 a.m., in Elmwood Park, Illinois.

I monitored the making of this part of the NBC documentary on UFO's, as I did on the previous night at Elk Grove Village, on the evening of May 27, 1965. Fortunately, all three witnesses are still holding down the same jobs, but only two were available for interview on this evening. The names of the witnesses were Officer [redacted], Officer [redacted] and Fireman [redacted].

All men stated that the incident had been reported to [redacted] but that [redacted] had merely said that they had nothing on their screens. Here's another case where [redacted] failed to follow through and report a sighting.

Officer [redacted] was ill on the night of the filming for the documentary, but I did talk at length with Officer [redacted] and with the fireman [redacted]. Both are [redacted]. Before passing any final judgment, I would like to talk with Officer [redacted] if I ever get the chance. If there had been only one witness of the caliber of either of the two I interviewed, I would tend to dismiss the incident as the product of an overwrought imagination. However, with three witnesses, with the two officers being on active duty, I feel that something was definitely sighted. Furthermore, the sighting occurred the day after the Loveland, Texas, cases, and the description is quite similar. However, it was determined that these men had no knowledge of the Loveland sighting of the previous day. They stated that after they came back to the station house at dawn, the morning Tribune had just been delivered, and in thumbing through the pages, they then came across an account of the Loveland sighting. They made a definite point of the surprise with which they met the Texas account.
