The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and an object above the horizon line. The instructions indicate that the viewer should imagine they are at the point shown, and place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when first seen, and a "B" on the same curved line to show where the object was when the viewer first saw it.

The second sketch shows a larger version of the curved line and object, with more details of the landscape below.

The third sketch shows a smaller version of the curved line and object, with a person standing in the foreground.
