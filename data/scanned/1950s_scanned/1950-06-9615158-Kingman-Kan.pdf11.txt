THE REV. ROSS VERMILLION-KINGMAN, KANSAS CASE
A UNITED PRESS DISPATCH DATED JUNE 25, 1950 TOLD THE REVEREND'S STORY. HIS REPORT OF A STRANGE LIGHT IN THE SKY HAD BEEN INVESTIGATED BY AUTHORITIES AND FOUND TO BE VALID. REVEREND ROSS VERMILLION OF THE CHENEY, KANSAS, CHRISTIAN CHURCH WOULD NOT GIVE DETAILS, BUT SAID THEY COULD BE SEEN ON A FLIGHT OVER KINGMAN ABOUT 100 MILES WEST OF KINGMAN, SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT, WHEN HE SAW A STRANGE AERIAL LIGHT.
"WE STOPPED THE CAR," A FELLOW MOTORIST CAME ALONG AND WE STOPPED TO TALK TO HIM. TOO PALE, SHAKEN AND SO TERRIFIED HIS SPEECH WAS UNCONTROLLED. HIS THREE DAUGHTERS WERE WITH HIM AND WE ALL WATCHED.
THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN WHO ONCE TRIED TO IGNORE A STRANGE LIGHT OVER KINGMAN, BUT WHATEVER HE SAW MANTLED HIM WITH TERROR. THEY FOUND THE REVEREND VERMILLION IN A STATE OF SHOCK.
DID THE KINGMAN SAUCER TAKE OFF IN A HURRY IN ORDER TO SAVE REVEREND VERMILLION'S LIFE AND AVOID ANOTHER UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT LIKE CAPTAIN MANTELL'S? OR WAS THE REVEREND AND HIS WIFE, MR. MULNIX, AND HIS THREE DAUGHTERS MISINTERPRETING VENUS AS THE AIR FORCE CLAIMED MANTELL HAD DONE?
