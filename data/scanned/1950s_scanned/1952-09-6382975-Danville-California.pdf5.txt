The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a sketch depicting the motion of an unidentified object.

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it.

Overhead

Horizon ----  You  ---- Horizon

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

(The sketch shows a curved motion path with "A" and "B" marked at the start and end points.)

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

(The sketch shows a hand-drawn object labeled "RG FILE 1 - 1 SIGHTING 4",  with an arrow indicating the direction of motion.)
