Initially, I saw them from my seat at the window, and I gazed at them for possibly half a minute or more. Their appearance suddenly attracted my attention from outside. I happened to be looking towards the front window, and I guess they must have appeared from behind the corner curved window as I saw them.

As they appeared to me, they were about 20 degrees above the horizon and west from the line of the front window. They seemed to be in an inverted saucer-shaped formation - that is, the bottom part was dome-like, and the top was flat or slightly concave. There was no trail or vapor stream behind them. Their color appeared to be a dull silver or aluminum, and they reflected the light from the sun slightly. Their speed was at least four or five times the speed of a jet plane, and they moved in a horizontal path, i.e., they did not climb or dive at any time while I observed them. Their motion appeared to be a steady progress, gliding, without any jerking or irregularity.

As I was both looking through the first window and then through the quarter window at the front, I noticed them very distinctly. In size, I would judge them to have been larger than a fighter plane, possibly two or three times as big, but this is a difficult dimension to estimate accurately. Their course was from west to east and rather high, as I previously stated.

The sighting lasted, as I mentioned, for possibly half a minute or a little more. Then, they simply disappeared from sight entirely as though they had been switched off. I did not see them break up, explode, or make any other abrupt change in their appearance. They just vanished, and I was unable to locate them again through the windows after they had disappeared.

Frankly, I was quite amazed at the sight and described it as accurately as I can recall. I have no other comments or conclusions to offer, save that it was a most unusual and unexpected experience.
