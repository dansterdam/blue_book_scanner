The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with text describing a reported UFO sighting.

the second ring's field which was an opposing field still connected with the ship and by magnetic opposition the ship could not move. It was a very large and big ship but it must be remembered that the ship if it was not attracted by gravity it would have been like a ship away out in outer space. It could be moved with almost no power at all. 

I read an account in the newspapers today about a story about an Army jet pilot who was sent up to investigate a similar ship, I think his name was Capt. Mantell. He radioed back to ground that the ship looked metallic and then he crashed. The investigators found out that his ship on the ground contained some radio-active material.

What I think happened was that Capt. Mantell decided to come in on a curve to get near to the UFO but when he got too close the positive flux of the two suddenly also acted just like a jet plane from gravity and its momentum carried him into the side of the UFO.

I wish the government would set up a research department to find out exactly what causes gravity and try to build aircraft and rockets which would fly gravity free. It would place us far ahead of the Soviet in all forms of Space Technology.
