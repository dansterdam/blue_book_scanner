SAUCER FEAR ALINED
There was a certain apprehension among scientists and the public that reported "sightings" of UFOS were not subject to scientific investigation and that anything unusual in the sky was likely to he described as a UFO, despite the scientific knowledge at that time.

A few days later, on March 11, when another Director's Office of Scientific Investigation was made, this comprehensive, careful and objective search and evaluation program was laid to keep the wite open.

The statement that the American public was distrustful of the aggressive "skeptical" UFOS. It is not beyond possibility that some of the reported sightings are of phenomena from other worlds, it still seems reasonable to assume that the greater proportion of them are of the earth's atmosphere or result from faulty human evaluation. Until we get more proof, we probably should be willing to study and investigate all reports with an open yet critical mind.
