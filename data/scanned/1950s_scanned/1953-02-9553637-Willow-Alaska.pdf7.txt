AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

CG 10th Air Division (Defense)       10AD-3-53                   FILE       4       DATE       4       PAGE       4  

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
It is believed that the sources of this information are very reliable. Both officers reported to be reliable individuals, have had many years flying experience, and accurately observed and reported their observations. Neither had any preconceived notions concerning unidentified flying objects, and seemed to be completely objective in making their observations.

ALL INFORMATION AS TO THE SOURCE OF THIS LIGHT HAVE BEEN EXAMINED WITH NO IDENTIFICATION BEING MADE. APPARENTLY NO DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE STATEMENTS OF THE TWO OFFICERS. THE FIRST THAT THEY INITIALLY OBSERVED BY MAJOR LENSE APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES AFTER BEING FIRST SIGHTED BY CAPTAIN GRAUER, AND THAT THE OFFICERS WERE OBSERVED IN BRINGING THEIR AIRCRAFT INTO A STANDARD RATE TURN.
