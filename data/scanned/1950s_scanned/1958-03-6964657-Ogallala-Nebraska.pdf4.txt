There does not appear to be any photograph in this image. The image contains handwritten text that appears to be an incident report or other document related to Project Blue Book.

TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:
The object was southwest of the witness. It was as bright as the bright star Sirius and approximately 2 to 3 times larger than a star. The object moved southwest to northeast and made no noise.
This report is submitted because of the possibility that it may have been some type of aircraft or object of scientific interest. Although the witness thought it might have been a jet, no sound was heard, and its movement did not resemble that of a jet aircraft. Thus, there remains the possibility that this was some type of unusual aerial phenomena.
