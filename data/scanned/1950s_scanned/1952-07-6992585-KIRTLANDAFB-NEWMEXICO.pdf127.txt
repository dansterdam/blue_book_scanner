Teletype HNIBRIT 310652 July submitted by March Flight Service Center

An unidentified flying object consisting of an intense white-blue light in a cloud followed by the appearance of a saucer shaped object was observed as approximately 1235PST on 30 July 1952. The light burned for about seven seconds. The object had a wobbling sort of motion and was approximately three miles from the observation

posts mainly used by landing aircraft at Burbank, California. The object appeared to be at least as large if not larger than a DC-6.
