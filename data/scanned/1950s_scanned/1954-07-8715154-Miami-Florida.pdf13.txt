SIGHTING OF OBJECT AT MIAMI, FLORIDA
JULY 8, 1954

The object first appeared in the South East at an altitude estimated to be about 4,000 feet. It was approximately 1 mile in diameter, disc shaped with a large dome on top. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes. The object appeared to be able to remain stationary, to move back and forth and to rise and descend at various speeds. As it moved, it emitted a bluish-white light. No noise or exhaust was observed. At approximately 1:15 AM, the object accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared in a Northeasterly direction.
