Dear Captain Wiggins:

I refer to the crash of the C-118 aircraft near Tacoma, Washington on April 1, 1959.

I would very much like to know what the Board of Inquiry that investigated this crash, has concluded to be the cause of the crash.

If possible, I should like to request a copy of the report of this Board of Inquiry.

Sincerely yours,
