COMMENTS (See reverse, if necessary):
1. There is very little information in this case to form a valid conclusion as to the nature of her sighting.
2. It is doubtful the young boy, living down and looking through a possibly dusty window, could be oriented enough to say the object turned north or south. The color of the object strongly suggests a fireball. However, the maneuver is apparently due to a slight oscillation in the object, as this could have been misinterpreted at this point. It is definitely a night case and the object appears to have been illuminated at this point.
