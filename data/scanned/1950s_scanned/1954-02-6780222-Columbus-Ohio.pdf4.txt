26 FEBRUARY 1954, COLUMBUS, OHIO

On the night of 26 February 1954, an unidentified flying object was sighted near Columbus, Ohio. The object appeared to be stationary and closely resembled a star in size and color. Shortly after the first observation, the object accelerated at a rapid rate in another direction, disappearing to a low altitude.

This case is concluded to have been an aircraft due to its characteristics and reported air activity in the area. Aircraft when at a distance and approaching head-on often appear to be stationary. Ascent might appear to be vertical for the same reason. After a turn is made, driving a new perspective, their acceleration is noticeable.
