THIS NARRATIVE REPORT CONCERNS OBSERVATIONS OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS MADE BY PERSONNEL OF THE 4750TH PILOT TRAINING WING, EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA, ON 6 MAY 1957.

ON THE EVENING OF 6 MAY 1957, NUMEROUS PERSONNEL OF THE 4750TH PILOT TRAINING WING OBSERVED UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENA IN THE VICINITY OF EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA.

AT APPROXIMATELY 2030 HOURS, A NUMBER OF AIRMEN STATIONED AT THE BASE WERE OBSERVING THE NIGHT SKY NEAR THE NORTHWEST BOUNDARY OF THE INSTALLATION. SUDDENLY, SEVERAL BRILLIANT LIGHTS APPEARED IN THE AIR APPROXIMATELY TWO MILES NORTHWEST OF THEIR LOCATION. INITIAL OBSERVATIONS INDICATED THE OBJECTS WERE MOVING AT HIGH ALTITUDES AND HIGH RATES OF SPEED.

PERSONNEL MANNING A CONTROL TOWER ALSO OBSERVED THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS AND NOTIFIED THE BASE OPERATIONS OFFICER, WHO IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED AN F-86D AIRCRAFT TO INVESTIGATE. THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO VISUALLY ACQUIRE OR ESTABLISH RADAR CONTACT WITH THE OBJECTS, WHICH CONTINUED TO MANEUVER IN THE SKY AT VERY HIGH SPEEDS.

AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES, THE BRILLIANT LIGHTS APPEARED TO ACCELERATE AND VANISH FROM SIGHT. NUMEROUS PERSONNEL CONTINUED OBSERVING THE SKY FOR SOME TIME, BUT NO FURTHER ACTIVITY WAS DETECTED.

LATER THAT EVENING, SEVERAL OTHER ISOLATED SIGHTINGS OF SIMILAR UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA WERE REPORTED BY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES ON BASE. HOWEVER, NO FURTHER INVESTIGATIVE ATTEMPTS WERE MADE.

THE INCIDENTS DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT WERE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED BY OFFICERS OF THE 4750TH PILOT TRAINING WING AND REPORTED TO HIGHER HEADQUARTERS. NO CONCLUSIONS COULD BE DRAWN AS TO THE NATURE OR ORIGIN OF THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS.
