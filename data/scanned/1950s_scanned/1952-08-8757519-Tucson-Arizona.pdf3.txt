I have been a pilot since 1949 and served almost 4 years in World War II as a pilot. I have seen many things similar to this object. It is a perfectly real and not fanciful. It was only one indication of altitude of the object since I did not have any other measuring devices. However, the sky was clear in all directions and the object appeared to be closer than the stars. It seemed much too large and too close to have been a star. It could possibly have been a weather balloon, but it seemed much too large and bright as we observed it. The duration and speed of observation would not fit the characteristics of a weather balloon.
