INVESTIGATION OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORTS

Two reports of unidentified flying object sightings, made on the night of 4 Feb 54, were received by ATIC from the 19th Air Division, Carswell Air Force Base, Texas.

It remained on a straight course and the GCA operator notified the control tower and the officer of the day. The control tower personnel sighted the object at 2301 and kept it under observation for five minutes until 2306 when it passed out of sight to the NW.
