FLIGHT RESEARCH LABORATORY NORTH

Suggested Sighting Station for Observation of Flying Saucers, Fireballs, Meteors, and other Atmospheric Phenomena.

CRITERIA:

1. The Sighting Station is cheap, transportable, easily maintained and easily operated.

2. The Sighting Station shall gather information from which can be determined:
a. Position
√ b. Velocity
√ c. Altitude
d. Size
√ e. Spectral Emission

It is proposed to build the Sighting Station component wise as follows:

a. A light gathering and focusing source is a six inch Schmidt System f 12 with a 1800 field fully corrected. (This system has only been available about three months based upon the results of a Flight Research Laboratory research project with Dr. James Baker of Harvard.)

b. The film travel and loading mechanism to be taken from standard Air Force 35mm cameras and adapted for spring operation. Five inch strip film would be suitable.

c. The Sighting Station box would be fabricated as desired.

d. A grating capable of being rotated by a spring drive would be placed at the focal plane. This would give the spectral characteristics of the body.

e. A shutter capable of being driven by a spring drive would be incorporated to give timing marks on any film tracks.

and rotated by a spring drive to eliminate the streaks on the photographic film.

DISCUSSION:
Present Air Force film travel and loading mechanism for five inch film are available in quantity and have a storage capacity which can allow for an exposure every 10-15 minutes for a twenty-four period. It should be mentioned that ordinary film can be exposed for at least two hours at night time without excessive fogging.
