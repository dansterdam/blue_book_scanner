3307TH TRAINING SQUADRON (CONTRACT FLYING)
MARANA AIR BASE
Marana, Arizona

15 April 1952

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object
TO: Whom it May Concern

On 3 April 1952, I landed T-6D number 406 at the Benson, Arizona airport. Approximately 0745 for the execution of a 45 minute solo student aerial navigation to the company of Marana Air Base. 

Shortly after taxiing into position for the best observation of aircraft which would be turning over Benson airport and shutting down my engine, I saw what appeared to be a bright star in the minature of the airport approximately 100 yards east of the hangar and facing a direction of 255 degrees.

At approximately 0805, Mr. C., who was assigned the position of patrol, landed his T-6D aircraft and taxied in close proximity to my aircraft and parked facing in the opposite direction.

With my radio on and remaining seated in the front seat of my aircraft, I was awaiting the return of the students when Mr. C. called my attention to a bright object which appeared to be of a bright star and was prominent enough so that one's attention was drawn to it. In other words, there was no necessity to scan to relocate the object. At this time, my attention was called to this object which I visually observed for approximately seven minutes.

Mr. C. pointed out the fact that it was still there. I impressed me as being rather cold that any airborne object could maintain the same position for this length of time. It occurred to me to take a fix on this object in relation to the top of the canopy. The reading of this fix was 0823 (I time checked with the tower before take-off from Marana) and the object was approximately two and one-half inches above the canopy when I was centered in the seat.
