ICE CREAM CONE INVESTIGATED BY AIR DEFENSE
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 9 (AP) - The Air Defense some are checking on a report about a strange object reported over the Alameda Naval Air Station Tuesday.
Lt, Comdr. J. P. Reeves at Hamilton Field said the investigation was being made of a report that a Navy officer and several enlisted men at the station saw what seemed to be a 50-foot ice cream cone-shaped object in the sky. They watched it for 10-15 minutes, Reeves said.
Lt. Comdr. D. R. Gillespie at the Alameda Naval Air Station said the object was spotted by Lt. Comdr. K. P. LeRandre and Lt. Comdr. J. L. Hessler of the station. They described it as a 50-foot ice cream cone. It moved in a straight line and disappeared in the distance, Gillespie said. Such a vapor trail might have been disastrous to aircraft, he added.
