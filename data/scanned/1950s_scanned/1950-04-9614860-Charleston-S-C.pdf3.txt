Meteor Seen In 
Carolina Cities

Observers in three South Carolina cities reported seeing a bright object "shooting" across the sky last night. The object was seen for several minutes by people in Columbia and Charleston.

They described the object as very bright and visible for at least 25 seconds. It was about as large as the full moon and appeared to be at an altitude of 5,000 to 4,000 feet.

The object was reported north of Charleston and visible across the western horizon. It moved at high speed and left no trail. The color was described as bluish white.

One witness near Charleston said the object appeared to be descending and he estimated it was 15 to 18 inches in diameter. It was visible for about 25 seconds. 

In Columbia, the object was reported to have flashed brilliantly for several seconds, then disappeared. It was visible from downtown Columbia and was seen by many people.
