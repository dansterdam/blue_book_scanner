SUBJECT: UFO Sighting, 7 February 1955
TO: SAFOI-34 (Maj. Tucker)

1. The attached report probably forwarded three tape recordings to this office by the Air Force Control Group. These tapes have been reviewed and generally reveal no information which would be beneficial to the air force in their analysis of the activities toward the air force by the UFO sightings.

2. The pertinent facts in this case indicate that the United States Government, and specifically the Air Force, is responsible for the lack of information which the individual had complained about in November 1954. The Air Force is further obligated to give out this information as disclosed November 1954 and July 1955. There is no interest in this case and the ATIC has no further ideas or activities required in this matter.

3. The case reported to the Air Force on 7 February 1955, at the field in the ATIC files as possibly an experimental aircraft. Mr. has divulged any additional information concerning this sighting, and this case is more than two years old. Any significant information ATIC has learned from this case and is willing to share with the individual has been provided.

4. The sighting of 1955 gave no evidence of national threat and in view of the Air Force's inability to establish anything of importance per the original evaluation, in view of no new evidence, holds firm.
