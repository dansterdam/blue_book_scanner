Sky Appearance, 7 AUG 1950 at 2:RICH in the vicinity of the Panama Canal. UNCLEAR as traveling from San Francisco to Balboa, Panama Canal. 
At this moment, there appeared to be a bridge of raster, indistinct. 
The sailor was the first to notice this phenomenon. It is suggested that a flaming aerial object could be a ship arising from the horizon. However, details do not permit a conclusive determination. The object was first observed to the southeast, and then disappeared to the north.
