The image contains a diagram that appears to be a celestial map or a view of the sky. It shows a hemispheric projection with various lines, angles, and directional labels. There is a hand-written text at the top that says "A - first spotted, B - radio cut" and "At B B about 15 MIN."

Now, as an OCR system, I will produce the text found in the document:

A - first spotted
B - radio cut
At B B about 15 MIN.
