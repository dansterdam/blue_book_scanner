I was unable at any time to estimate either the altitude or distance of the object from the field due to my not knowing the intensity of the light.

Radar at Detail Control, under supervision of Captain Horwatt, determined the position of the object as one line as bearing from the field at a bearing of 261 degrees magnetic.

To the best of my recollection the C-47 was Captain T. S. Fyson, 1256th USAF Pilot, Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. Captain Horwatt was in the 1252nd AC & W Squadron. The assistant navigator was WOJG Simmons, USAF Detachment, Kelly Air Force Base.

We observed the object for approximately 30 minutes, weather being clear with 15 miles visibility. My final report to the control center was at 0237 hours, 23 July 1952.
