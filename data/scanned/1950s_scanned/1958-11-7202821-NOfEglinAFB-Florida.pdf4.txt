The entire path paralleled for approximately one-half except the beginning and the ending which were not observed. He further states that the object appeared to be moving at a tremendous rate of speed and seemed to be under intelligent control. At one point he observed the object come to a virtual standstill and then accelerate to a terrific speed. The entire report is classified for security reasons beyond the scope of this report.
