aerial phenomena in the vicinity of Holloman since September 1950.
The populace around HAFB seem to have lost their sensitivity as observers. Even during the meteor shower of 11-12 August 1951, no alarming reports were received. However, on 14 March 1952, nine Bell personnel reported sighting between fourteen and twenty bodies that unlike a close of scene. On 9 July a "red glowing ball" was sighted by a sergeant stationed at the Corona Experimental Radar site at Corona, New Mexico. (Copies of both reports are attached).
More recently, a pilot reported some aerial objects which, after investigation, were identified as planets.

Mr. H. Guldenberg, who is an assistant to Major Ley and an active amateur astronomer, commented that he has been spending several hours at his telescope almost every night for the past few years and never once observed an unexplicable object; that on one occasion, an excited acquaintance was notified when a "strange object" showed up as an eagle in the telescope; that Clyde Tombaugh, discoverer of the planet Pluto and now engaged in activities at White Sands, never observed an inexplicable aerial object despite his continuous and extensive observations of the sky; that Fred Whipple in his work photographing meteors at Las Cruces, never detected a strange aerial object with his sensitive cameras; and that the A and M College at Las Cruces engages in astronomical observations but had never observed strange aerial phenomena.
