The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing a form with questions to be filled out.

As requested, I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand (Circle One):
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Nickel
e. Quarter
f. Half dollar
g. Silver dollar
h. Baseball
i. Grapefruit
j. Basketball
k. Other ________________________________________________

22.1 (Circle One of the following) indicates how certain you are of your answer to question 22:
a. Not very sure
b. Fairly certain
c. Positive, no doubt

23. How did the object or objects appear to move from your view?
Straight up and down, very fast, no sound.

24. In order that we can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Lit what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape? Assuming you were allowed to examine a similar object which you placed side by side with the one you saw, would the actual object appear about the same size, smaller, or larger, and would it be heavier, lighter, or the same weight?

As the appearance of a very large star then as a little round ball of light and then as a fiery gaser with fiery tail. It seemed to appear and disappear.
