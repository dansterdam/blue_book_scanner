TO: A/10
Commanding General,
Tenth Air Force,
Moriarity, New Mexico.

At 0715, 30 April 1952, as I was on duty from 0001 to 0930, I observed an unusual aircraft which I believe to be a flying saucer. This saucer appeared approximately at 3,600 to 5,000 feet altitude, and was moving in a northerly direction at a very high rate of speed. The saucer appeared on the scope as a usual aircraft would appear, except that the pip was very much brighter. The saucer was also seen visually by Sergeant on duty with me. The saucer appeared on the scope for approximately 1 minute, 20 seconds, and then disappeared.

Attached hereto is the approximate path of flight the saucer was in as I saw it.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 30th day of April 1952.
