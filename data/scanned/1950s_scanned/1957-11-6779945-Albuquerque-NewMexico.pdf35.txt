Sputnik II
Spotted
Upstate
Upstate "moomwatchers" reported today they got a "clear view" of Sputnik II passing across the sky about an hour before going out of sight.
Sputnik II's passage came from southwest to northeast at about 6:17 p.m. (chme)., the Indianapolis time announced. It would be visible.
SEVERAL Goshen residents reported seeing a bright white light moving from southwest to northeast. The Smithsonian Institute in Washington had announced it would be visible.
The announcement of Sputnik II's flight had been made in Des Moines at that moment.
In the department of unidentified flying objects, too, residents got into the act over Newcastle.
At Newcastle a group in route home from a school athletic game told The Indianapolis Times the object they saw "broke into two smaller objects." Mrs. Barlow, New Iberia, said she and her two children said the object "hovered over their automobile" as they were driving home from the game between Straughn and Atlanta.
After illuminating the sky, the object, Barlow said, went out of sight. Several other parties, including one in which a basketball coach at Straughn was riding, stopped while the incident occurred, gazed at the object.
MRS. BARLOW said the object "came suddenly down, made a sharp turn and then hovered above the car and made no sound close enough to hit with a BR gun."
Finally, the object moved upward and divided by at least two smaller objects, Mrs. Barlow said.
