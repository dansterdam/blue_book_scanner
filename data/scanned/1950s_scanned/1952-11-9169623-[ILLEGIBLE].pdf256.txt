The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch. The sketch depicts an overhead view with a horizon line, showing the position of an object from two different perspectives - the position when the object was first seen ("a 'A'") and the position when it was last seen ("a 'B'"). The instructions ask the viewer to draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made, with an arrow indicating the direction of the object's movement.
