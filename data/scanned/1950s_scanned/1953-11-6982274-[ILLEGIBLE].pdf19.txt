12. Identification of the fighting formations: This sighting was reported to us by Lt Col 8. I. Hatch from the 1st Fighter Group, USAF; Borie AFDB, Texas. According to his report, on 13 August 1952, he and two other pilots were flying in formation near Crete when they observed an object maneuvering in the sky.  The object was silver in color and appeared to be a disc about 30 feet in diameter. The object was seen to make a rapid climbing turn and then level off at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet. The object was observed for approximately 3 minutes.
The reporting officer finds no explanation for the sighting. He states that it was very difficult to determine the nature of the object. The pilots estimate the size of the object as 30 feet in diameter. The pilots stated that the object maneuvered and climbed in a very rapid manner. They could not indicate the objects speed, but did state that it was far in excess of the speed of their jets (which they estimated to be 600 mph). The pilots stated that the object appeared to be metallic and disc-shaped.
