DATE June 13, 1961

In December of 1952 I was training to try out at school in St Augustine Florida. A few week school starting in January of 1953.
Each night I would run 5 miles as part of my training. I had just pulled up to a walk after running and to my right (west) I saw the Saucer in one place for about 10 seconds. There were 5 or 6 windows lit up inside with white light. The Saucer outer rim was spinning and I could hear its hum, the Saucer had a blue glow and a bluish flame was burning at the rear of the Saucer. Then the bluish flame turned to a big bright red flame and the Saucer shot up and clear across the sky at a terrific speed. This is the whole truth and so will take any -action at any time.
