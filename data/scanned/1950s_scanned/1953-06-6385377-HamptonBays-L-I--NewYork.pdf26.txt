American Machine & Foundry Company
Executive Offices
511 Fifth Avenue
New York 17, New York

Attention: Mr. Alexander C. Wall
Assistant to Vice President
Engineering Division

Dear Mr. Wall:

In the absence of Brigadier General Garland who, as you may know, is presently in Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C., I am taking the liberty of acknowledging the receipt of your letters of 18 November and 2 December 1953.

In that I was not involved in your conversation with General Garland and our people here, I am asking Lt Colonel Johnston to review your letters and the inclosure.

I am sure that were General Garland here, he would express his appreciation for your assistance and interest in this matter.

Very truly yours,

GEO. L. WERTENBAKER
Colonel, USAF
Commander
