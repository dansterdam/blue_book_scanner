II. RELIABILITY: Source appeared to be of average intelligence and was responsible in his efforts to help solve this problem. He had a firm conviction that he had never seen objects such as these and carefully thought out his statements.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source's attention was brought to this incident and he called it to the attention of the military personnel at the Lincoln AFB tower. He noticed and to the east where he last saw the objects, noticing that they were extremely bright and moving in a wiggly motion. They were at a relative high speed and appeared to be quite large objects. When they increased in speed the size did not seem to change nor did their brightness. Source estimated the objects were five to ten miles from and quite high up. After watching for approximately 15 minutes the objects gradually faded from view.
