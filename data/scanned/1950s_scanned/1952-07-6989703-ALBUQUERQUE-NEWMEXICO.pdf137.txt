12. COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

The four men interviewed on this sighting are all experienced in making and reporting meteorological observations. They are thoroughly reliable as individual observers. The interpretation they made of the objects observed is, of course, subjective and may be erroneous. It is not the intention of this report to include only what they had actually seen and not include any assumption or conclusion on their part.
