The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch on the bottom shows a road leading into a rural landscape with trees and buildings. The smaller sketch on the top right shows a curved line representing the horizon and an object above the horizon, suggesting the silhouette of an object.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to the smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
