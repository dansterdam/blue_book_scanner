REPORT OF INFORMATION RECEIVED 
Received information via telephone from Mrs. Hartwell
regarding sighting of an unidentified flying object seen by
her husband and herself on 6 January 1952, at approximately

vicinity of Norwalk, Connecticut.
Mrs. Hartwell stated that the object was first sighted in the
western sky and was described as being circular in shape,
with a bright light illuminating the entire circumference, 
and a smaller light in the center. The object was said to
have been hovering, maneuvering, and pulsating, while making

Further investigation revealed that the reported object was
also sighted by other witnesses in the area.
