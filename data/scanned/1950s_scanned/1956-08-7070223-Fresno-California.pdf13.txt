First - May I mention that shortly after the passage of flying objects my wife and I could see that they were quite high up and I could hear no sound in connection with them. Shortly after, they completely disappeared from view. 

Approximately 9:45 PM on Aug 7, 1956 my wife and I were sitting on the porch in back of our house. The moon was just rising over the trees but quite bright - without artificial light. I noticed some movement in the sky and pointed out to my wife a group of approximately 6-8 objects moving in rapid succession or "flight" from the west going east. They were traveling at a very high rate of speed and making no sound whatsoever. The objects passed overhead disappearing from view in the east. I would estimate that this occurred over a period of about 20 minutes.
