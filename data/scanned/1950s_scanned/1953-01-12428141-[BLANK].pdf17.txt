ONE and and the same. Get some information on the location of the reported object, the time and course, then check this against the flight of the aircraft. If it correlates to a reasonable degree, they were very probably the same thing.

Reporting Solutions:
If, during an investigation of a sighting, after a TWX has been sent report- ing the incident, the investigating officer should identify the reported object.
ATIC should be immediately notified as to the solution.

Popular Theories:
Many theories have been advanced that all of the reports are due to mirages, sun dogs, ice clouds and what-have-you. Some of our reports are caused by such things. We have received excellent photos of sun dogs and descriptions of mirage effects. These are definitely in the minority; however, and cause only a small percentage of the sightings.

Another popular solution is that all "flying saucers" are "skyhook" balloons. To check this a study of about 25 cross-country balloon tracks were made. To remove any doubt, the tracks were taken of flights made during July and August 1952 when reports were coming in at the rate of 50 per day. These balloons were seen and reported as "flying saucers" at only 3 points.

Questionnaires:
We are continually being asked, "What information do you want in a report?" This question becomes such a common item that we are forced to emphasize time and again what information is desired. There are, however, certain items that pertain to every sighting. These are briefly listed in AFL 200-5, but are not given in any great detail.
