STATEMENT

While driving north about 7 miles north of Levelland, Texas, I saw a light about the size of a basketball about 300 or more feet above ground traveling from east to west. The light was moving slowly and silently. It appeared to be about 3 miles distant. It was much about a 1 mile distance. No sound was heard while getting closer and the balloon object above it. It continued moving north to about 3 or 4 minutes.   And then the bright object above it disappeared as it went behind some trees.
