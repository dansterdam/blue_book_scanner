**NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE**

**ON AERIAL PHENOMENA**

**WASHINGTON 6, D. C.**
----
**March 19, 1960**

**The Honorable Dudley C. Sharp,**
**Secretary of the Air Force,**
**The Pentagon,**
**Washington 25, D. C.**

**My dear Mr. Secretary:**

As requested by members of the NICAP Board of Governors, I am forwarding photo-copies of two Federal Aviation Agency logs showing a report of a UFO sighted and tracked by radar over Oregon on Sept. 24, 1959. As you will see by the accompanying letter from FAA Regional Director of Region 4, these logs were officially released to NICAP at our request.

Also enclosed is a photo-copy of a letter from your official UFO spokesman, Major Lawrence J. Tacker, in which he admits that the UFO was tracked by radar and gives the ATIC opinion that the object was a balloon.

In view of the official FAA evidence, the balloon answer is clearly impossible. No balloon maneuvers, zigzags or fires off exhaust from its base, as described; nor could any aerial object attain the high speeds or carry out the described maneuvers which occurred before, during and after the approach of the Air Force F 102 interceptor fighter.

Major Tacker, acting as the official spokesman for the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, states that ATIC labeled this report "insufficient evidence." It would appear that this label was assigned an an extreme contrast with impressive radar sighting. The detailed evidence was clearly delineated and officially reported by expert FAA observers, Air Force F-102 pilots, three AF GCI radar operators at Klamath Falls and a Redmond city policeman.

By Air Force Regulation 200-2, such UFO reports must be sent immediately by electrical means to neighboring, centers or radar to ATIC, Air Defense, and the nearest Air Defense Aviation. The pattern of ATIC intelligence, said to be part of Project. The regulation states that "such messages be the same priority as emergency'. this obviously must have been known through the preliminary reports and follow up investigations, that very short time. We will add that the Federal Aviation Agency states the Air Force was promptly informed.

Since the FAA, Klamath Falls GCI and F-102 pilots' reports
