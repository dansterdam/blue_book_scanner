Witness - Mrs. Virginia Coburn  

Mrs. Coburn reported observing a luminous, elongated object which appeared to be hovering over a field near her home. The object was approximately 30-40 feet long and about 15 feet wide. It had a dark band around the middle and was emitting a bright, white light. The object was observed for about 10 minutes before it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared. Mrs. Coburn said the object moved silently and did not resemble any known aircraft.
