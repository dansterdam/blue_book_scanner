1. ON 8 June 1954, at 2330 hours, an explosion of fragmentation cluster bombs occurred in a restricted ammunition area in Red River Arsenal, Texarkana, Texas. TWO blasts in rapid succession, within seconds, approximately 150 yards apart, left large holes in the ground and uprooted trees over a large area, creating considerable damage and debris scatter over the surrounding area for a distance of 150 to 300 yards. No one was in the area at the time of the explosion, except the driver of a military vehicle. Damage to this vehicle was minor and the driver was not injured.

2. On 9 June 1954, no cause of the explosion had been determined, but it was the opinion of Colonel Airup that there was a minor electrical storm in the area at the time, and that the explosions may have been accidental. Preliminary examination failed to disclose the possibility of sabotage.

3. On 8 June 1954, at 0100 hours, Mr. Hooks, a civilian guard at the Depot Division, Red River Arsenal, who is reported by the Military Intelligence Officer, Red River Arsenal, to be a reliable and conscientious observer, observed about 5,000 to 10,000 feet altitude but moving downward, a traveling light, which he could not identify. The object was bright and toward the west-northwest, and the Red River Arsenal. The object was about the size of a grapefruit, or smaller, and made a humming sound which he heard for about 30 seconds. Shortly after he heard the explosion in the direction of the Arsenal. A copy of his statement is attached.
