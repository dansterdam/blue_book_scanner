SECTION IV

Physiological Aspects

Physiological factors may have profound effects upon an individual's ability to observe and to interpret observations accurately. One of the greatest hindrances to human understanding can result from deception of the senses. The sense of sight is, by itself, purely a physical process and the perception and understanding attached to certain sights is determined largely by memory of past experiences and familiarity with surrounding objects. This relation of experiences to the interpretation of visual sightings permits many errors.

This margin of error may be applicable particularly to aircrew members operating high-performance aircraft, under adverse or unusual weather conditions, under tension, and during periods of extreme fatigue.

The aircrew member is generally familiar with many of the unusual observations associated with meteorological and astronomical phenomena. However, many unusual observations are the result of certain physiological effects that may be unknown or unfamiliar.

Occasionally, objects that exist on the surface of the eye may be mistaken for distant objects. These objects take various forms. They specks of dirt may appear as shimmering globules of light and, if a speck is illuminated by a outside light source, it may appear as a large, well-defined glow of light. If this speck is viewed against a dark sky or background, it may be quite spectacular. As this speck floats across the pupil of the eye, it will create the appearance of movement.

Many reported unidentified objects, described as flying saucers, glowing disks, shiny spots or a string of pearls, are nothing more than minute blood capillaries on the surface of the retina of the eye, or tiny corpuscles, which become visible under special conditions of illumination.

Another physiological phenomenon is that of after-image. A sudden flash of light affects the retina of the eye and causes a dark image to remain visible for some time after the light has been extinguished. This will cause this effect and may be confused and interpreted as unidentified flying objects.
