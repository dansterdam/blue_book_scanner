The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an excerpt from a written UFO report. I will now proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document:

I stared, unable to believe my eyes, thinking I must be mistaken....but no, there it was! So I stammered to my husband, "Look out there, Quick! Do you see?...what I see?" He took one look and brought the car to a stop. We sat there on the hilltop (or rise) and stared. I said, amazed, "Why it's a Flying Saucer! It is....isn't it?" My husband, who is very conservative, answered, "Well, it certainly appears to be something like that!"

My first impression was that it looked something like a gunmetal yo-yo. It appeared to be made of two sections of dark gun-metal with an aperture between them. From this aperture, as if from windows, port-holes, or similar openings, came wisps of white smoke or vapor which seemed carried slightly to one side by the wind. The UFO was hovering, as I have described, but constantly undulating as it hovered.

(Please see amateurish drawing, attached.)

At this moment, we became aware of another car coming up behind us and my husband, hoping for another witness, leaped out and tried to flag it down. The driver, a man, gave him a scared look and sped on. Two or three other cars came from behind us (perhaps people going to work) and my husband tried to stop them, with the same results. We both shouted and pointed toward the UFO, but the passers-by sped on without looking at it. We were disappointed, but not surprised. Nobody wants to be stopped on a lonely road in the rain at the dawn's early light by a couple of excited and gesticulating strangers! (The road was lonely only at this hour, however. It is a well-traveled highway.)

At least 5 minutes passed while we watched the UFO, perhaps
