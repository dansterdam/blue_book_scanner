Text extracted from the document:

This is a case report of an object seen by John R. Doe. 

Mr. Doe was driving a car. I was going too. I saw what I at first thought was an aircraft on fire. 

What made you think it was an aircraft on fire? 

It appeared to be glowing reddish-orange.

How high up was it? 

It was relatively low, perhaps 1000 to 2000 feet up.

In what direction was it moving? 

It was moving in a straight line, in a northeast direction.

What did the object look like? 

It appeared to be round or oval in shape.

How long did you watch the object? 

I watched it for about 3 to 5 minutes.

Was the object visible all the time? 

Yes, it was visible the entire time I observed it.

What happened to the object? 

It appeared to fade out as it moved across the sky.

What other comments would you make about this incident?

It's strange character of the glow, and the fact that it seemed to just fade out, are the most unusual aspects.
