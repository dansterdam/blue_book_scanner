There is no photograph present in this image, which appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image shows a typed document with text that describes the subject matter as "UFO Sightings" and contains further details about the sightings and instructions for handling the reports.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now transcribe the text from the document:

AEROSPACE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE
OHIO

REPLY TO ATTN OF: AFOIN-REPC

SUBJECT: UFO SIGHTINGS  

TO: SAFOI-3d (L/Col Anderson)

1. Attached are copies of letters which were forwarded to ATIC by the AMA and the MASA scientific flight objects. The information contained in these letters is not sufficient for a conclusion to be reached by ATIC; therefore, request ATIC Forms #14 be sent to the witnesses for their completion and forwarding directly to this center, ATTN: AFOIN-REPC.

2. Addresses of the witnesses are as follows:
WITNESS #1: [REDACTED]
Lanett, Alabama
WITNESS #2: [REDACTED] 
Williamsburg, Virginia

3. If the above witnesses know of any other witnesses to the sightings, request this information be included in their reports.
