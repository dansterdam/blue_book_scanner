Like the moon, it has no light of its own but is illuminated by the sun; so that one half is bright and the opposite half dark. Like April it is uncertain, sometimes it appears so bright that it becomes visible in daylight, and then again it disappears. Since then it has been moving and a few months between the earth and the sun has been seen. But on June 22 it will again be visible as a crescent shape. This shape will be small and the sun will probably not rise much until the end of the month. This will be the first appearance of Venus again, visible in the evening before sunrise. It will remain a crescent shape until it becomes a gibbous phase, then it will pass between us and the sun and become a half circle crescent again, visible in the morning before sunrise.

Venus' Approach
On Dec. 21 the sun, which has apparently been travelling southward in the sky since June 21, will be at its lowest elevation for the year. This is the winter solstice - the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere - and the shortest day of the year.

At that moment the sun will be directly over a point near the southern edge of the Northern Territory of Australia, on the border between Queensland and the Northern Territory. It will be high in the sky, marking summer's beginning.
