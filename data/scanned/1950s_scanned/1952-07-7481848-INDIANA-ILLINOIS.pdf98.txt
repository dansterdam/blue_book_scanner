The image contains a photograph of a sketch that appears to depict the shape of a UFO. The sketch shows an oval-shaped object with the label "Direction of Flight" written below it. The text in the image states that there was "No sound, exhaust, or vapor trail" associated with the object.

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how? Behind some hills

15. Did the object move behind something at any time, particularly a cloud? If you answered YES, then tell what it moved behind: Some hills, probably

16. Did the object move in front of something at any time, particularly a cloud? If you answered YES, then tell what it moved in front of: No

17. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: None
b. Color: Brilliant white or blue-white

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick at arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you can perform this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head? If it was about twice (or a little more) the apparent diameter of the object as I recalled, the object must have been quite small, possibly as it rose up to the time I stopped observing.

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Let's and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving. 
No sound, exhaust, or vapor trail.
