AF FORM 112 - PART II
CONFIDENTIAL

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM:  (From) Intelligence Office
34 Bombardment Wing (L) ADO 970

COMMENT of the Approving Officer:
Information at this Directorate indicates that this was a possible observation of a small, glowing object and sparks are probably the result of the meteor burning out in the earth's atmosphere. Because of the difficulty of obtaining detailed information at high altitudes, this observation is of doubtful value as evidence of the presence of any unconventional or ground type aircraft.
