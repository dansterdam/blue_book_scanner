As for the White Sands sightings, the AF explanation speaks of "lights seen by planes" - in a most unsatisfactory way. This is the newspaper people account, said "lights were seen by man" (now the AF doesn't know about that? then why don't they know about the 10,000 facts? Were the lights also seen by planes? The newspaper people say they were.

The West Texas reports were only hours old when sightings were made independent of the White Sands project. The ground observers in the old A-bomb testing areas outside of the White Sands Proving Ground, observed very bright blueish-white, egg-shaped objects, about 75-100 yards in diameter, descend from very high altitude, it went out of sight about the same altitude it entered, they said. "It came straight down," "no traces were found," and "no unusual effects on the men" were noticed.

In one case, an old bunker, the light "took off" at a 45-degree angle and appeared to disappear. None of the men in either patrol had known each other, and started biultining when it disappeared. More of the men in either patrol had known each other, and started biuliting when it disappeared.
