The image contains a photograph depicting an "Aircraft with No Wings". The document describes this as a "cigar-shaped object without wings or tail" that was observed flying through the air in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It was the Aerodyne, a revolutionary model aircraft designed by Alexander Lippisch, a German aeronautics expert who previously worked for the Collins Radio Company. The document states that the aircraft was powered by a motor that drew air through its front and expelled it through the rear, allowing it to lift and fly without conventional wings.

AIRCRAFT WITH NO WINGS
A cigar-shaped object without wings or tail drones through the air last week inside a hangar in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It was the Aerodyne, a revolutionary model aircraft designed by Alexander Lippisch, German aeronautics expert who now works for the Collins Radio Company. Instead of wings, the Lippisch Aerodyne has louvers in the belly with enough force to keep it up: they the louvers the Aerodyne no need for wings. 
Since the wings of conventional planes heat up at supersonic speeds, Lippisch thinks the wingless Aerodyne foreshadows the design of future jet-pro aircraft. Suggesting that he has given him a sizable sum to further his research.
