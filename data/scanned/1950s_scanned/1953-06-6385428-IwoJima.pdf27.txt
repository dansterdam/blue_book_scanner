The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. The image shows a circular instrument or device, possibly some kind of radar or monitoring equipment. There are various measurements and markings around the circular display, but no clear indication of what the device is used for. Without any human faces or other identifying elements, I cannot provide any further details about the individuals involved.
