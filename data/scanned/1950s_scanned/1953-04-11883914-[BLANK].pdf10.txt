to

ANALYSIS OF EXISTING SIGHTING REPORTS

Sighting reports dated up to and including June, 1952, have been
processed.  Except for the reports dated 1917 and 1918, all sighting reports
up to and including March, 1952, have been evaluated.  The sighting reports for
1917 and 1918 are not available for evaluation.  As soon as the 1917 and 1918
reports are available and can be evaluated, all sighting reports for the years
1917 to 1952 will be ready as a group for preliminary analysis utilizing IBM
equipment.

Sighting reports for the month of July, 1952, have been received.
Because there are 450 sighting reports for July, processing them will not be
completed until the first week in December.  Evaluation of reports for the
months of April, May, June, and July, 1952, will require about six days of conference time.  Conferences for the evaluation of sighting reports will be
arranged as reports become processed in groups of 200.  Each group of reports
will require about two days of work for a cooperating researcher-UFAFB
evaluation team.
