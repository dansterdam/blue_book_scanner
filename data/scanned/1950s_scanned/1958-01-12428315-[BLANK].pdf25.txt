Text from the document:

(FILM - P-51 ZOOMING UPWARD)
EDWARDS:
...yet he headed upward. One of his wingmen broke off as the climb began. The remaining two stayed with him to 15,000 feet, then broke off. Mantell was in a maximum climb at 22,500, his plane under perfect control.

(CUT BACK TO EDWARDS)
From this point on, there is nothing but mystery. Transmission was garbled and attempts to contact Mantell went unanswered.
Mantell's plane began to level off at 30,000 feet...began a gradual turn to the left...then it nosed downward...and...at full power...began to dive. Between 10 and 20 thousand feet, the plane literally tore apart.
