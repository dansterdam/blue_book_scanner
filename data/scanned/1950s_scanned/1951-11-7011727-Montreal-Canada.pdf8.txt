The observational data would have been of considerable value if the observer's positions could have been accurately determined. Since the observers were not trained to give accurate positions, their locations were not precisely determined. The health of the observers' position (c) appeared good and was checked as such, about 1/2 hour after the incident occurred. Calculations of the altitude of the object from (c-2) and (c-3) to point at disappearance (c-1) was imprecise, being based an an estimate only of 4 miles approximate.

The report of this case is based upon an official USAF investigation as detailed by the investigator. He was a trained observer and has had extended experience (5-7) years) in such investigations. His first impressions, of course, is to the best location of the observers' positions he could determine from the data given him. This fell short, however, of the accuracy desirable for a precise computation of altitude and speed.

The investigator reported that the plane was seen clearly (shortly) and the approximate size of the object was estimated at 100 feet in diameter as the plane approached within 2 minutes. The path between (b-1) and (a-1) being a curving flight was not at full speed (estimated 150-200 mph). The first observation was at 11:29 - 5000 = 12:29 plus or minus 2 minutes, the duration being 10-15 seconds. The azimuth was 11 degrees and the elevation was 30 degrees. The last observation was at 12:30 or 12:31.

It was reported that the observers were highly reliable and their characters were beyond reproach. The investigator stated that the sightings were not the result of any illusions or hallucinations, and that the object was observed by several competent and well-qualified observers.
