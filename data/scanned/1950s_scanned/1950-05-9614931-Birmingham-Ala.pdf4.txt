BIRMINGHAM POST 5 MAY 50

What Might Be Flying Disc
Seen Here By 7 Persons
Tail Was 'Long Fiery Streak'
At least seven persons saw it. And
the main thing they seemed to notice
was that the "tail was a long fiery
streak."
According to a Birmingham business-
man who recently viewed the mys-
terious object, the seven persons saw
something they "had never seen be-
fore."
D. C. Roys, a former newspaper re-
porter, told the Southern Outdoors
Corp., this particular of the uniden-
tified object:
"It was the most amazing thing I've
ever seen." Roys said the object was
traveling at a high rate of speed and
the tail was approximately one-half to
three-fourths the size of the object it-
self.
"It appeared to grow real bright, then
dim down and then brighten up again.
The color of the tail was a reddish
orange, almost as though it was burn-
ing."
As suddenly as the end of about 15
seconds the object disappeared, Roys
said the witnesses were unable to de-
termine whether it went straight up,
straight down or in some other di-
rection.
Another resident, who declined to per-
mit use of his name, said he also saw
the object and that the "tail was the
most unusual part of it."
He said that as the object hurtled
across the sky it "seemed to have a
sort of a fluttering, or wavering move-
ment. It wasn't a searchlight. There
wasn't a sound."
