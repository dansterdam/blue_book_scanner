Dear Sir:

In accordance with a request submitted by Flight Service through the Wright Air Route Control Center, we are attaching a report concerning an observation which was made while operating American Airlines flight 359 between Boston and La Guardia on June 29, 1953.

"Flight 359 was just north of Woonsocket at 4,000 feet on compass course of 220 degrees. The pilot observed a strange object in the sky to the south. According to the light flash, it appeared to have occurred at an estimated altitude of 14,000 feet. The light then broke into two separate lights, and the light increased in size up into two separate lights, one much larger than the other. All lights fell towards the ground, diminishing in size until they disappeared it took between one and one-half and two and one-half minutes.

"I can only guess, but it is my observation the objects fell into the Sound in an area bounded by westerly, Rhode Island; Block Island and Montauk Point."

If we may be of further assistance concerning this incident, please advise.

Yours very truly,
AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.
