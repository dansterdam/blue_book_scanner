The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from the Project Blue Book UFO investigation program.

The text in the document reads:

The sighting was publicized in a Dayton newspaper. This is a good example of how known phenomena can cause wide-spread speculation, due to an inexperienced observer. Two factors are interesting to note: (1) That the incident was carried in a newspaper, and (2) that the newspaper story increased that V-F-293 never could not identify it. This is the type of publicity given to known objects which touches off the "saucer" hysteria.
