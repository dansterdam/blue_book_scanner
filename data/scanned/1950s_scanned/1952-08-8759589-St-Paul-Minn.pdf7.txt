I have no idea the distance it was away from me. It could have been a mile or many miles, but it did not come out of a cloud, and was underneath the cloud.

This was not imagination, neither did it come from any reflection, nor was it caused by any defect of my eyes. Though I use 1.73 years old, and requires[strong glasses for reading I only use them when I read and did not have them on at the time I saw this object. It did not excite me at all. I looked away to the first time with, and showed it unto to a neighbor's house and related to him what I had seen, was he made no voice to me about it. I also wrote a short letter to the Charlotte Daily Observer, which they published. I told this and persons whom I met about it afterwards. I have found quite some that others have seen unusual things in the air in the day time and at night, but since people are inclined to take such accounts as a joke or a delusion they do not care to tell about them.

I have seen many meteors in my life time--and one large one that exploded in the air, also Northern Lights, total eclipse of the sun, balloons, airplanes, etc., but I have never seen anything excite perfectly bright lights of o.
as skeptical as any one could be about flying saucers. Now I believe what I read about most of them. Several unusual things have been seen in the last few years in North Carolina and also in South Carolina that probably have never been reported.
