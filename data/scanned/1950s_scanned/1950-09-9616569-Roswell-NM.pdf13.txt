The eyewitness since 1930, carried the following account of "flying discs" reportedly sighted by members of a family of Jacksonville, Louisiana on 5 November 1950:
"Jensonville, Nov 6 (Special) - "Flying saucers" made their first reported appearance over Catahoula Parish Monday, according to Cleve Poyton, a farmer who lives nearby. About 1:45 p.m. Judy, the family cook, was on her way home after washing the dinner dishes. She rushed back into the house shouting: "There's photos done come after we might in the broad open daylight." They're hovering right out there over the trees." 
Several members of the Poyton family rushed outside to see the saucer, which at that time had risen to about 60 feet above the ground.
"It's Poyton said what they saw was "so bright and shiny we couldn't tell anything about its shape or size."
As they watched, he said, the saucer went up to the northwest. There were twin exhausts, such as made by jet planes, but the exhausts did not stay parallel, he said.
