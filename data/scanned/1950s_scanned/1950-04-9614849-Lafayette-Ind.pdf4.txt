The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document that describes a sighting of a UFO in 1950 in the Balearic Islands, Spain. The text states that a large flurry of UFO photographs were recorded in 1950, with a photograph taken by a Newsreel cameraman Enrique Hausemann Muller showing a "Pinwheel-shaped object spinning and throwing off rays of exhaust, taken on April 24."
