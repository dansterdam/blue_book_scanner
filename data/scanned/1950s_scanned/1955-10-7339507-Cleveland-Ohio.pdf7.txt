Forward

We of the U.F.O.R.G. are civilians interested in the security of these United States. We operate on a non-profit basis and the time of our investigators is donated. Two of our members are civilians associated with these investigations of flying object sightings as they occur in the insurance and business fields. The committee is actually comprised:

We literally stumbled onto a sighting of an unidentified flying object like in 1955 and ever since we have been studying and investigating the matter in the interest of our country's security.

The sighting reports included in this paper are to be considered confidential as they may divulge scientific and technical data indirectly connected with the witness as the witness himself as the witness co-operates with us.

Because the Department of the Air Force has set up the special project "Blue Book" we feel it is our duty as Americans to prepare a complete report of our investigations, findings and conclusions for Air Technical Intelligence Center to aid in further accumulation of intelligence for this serious matter.

As a last word we would like to state that our investigators are firmly convinced that a more thorough study of the areas involved will turn up other past reports and possibly uncover an organized intelligence beyond our present comprehension, not only of a factual character, but also scientific facts that may or may not account for the unusual behavior in this one case.
