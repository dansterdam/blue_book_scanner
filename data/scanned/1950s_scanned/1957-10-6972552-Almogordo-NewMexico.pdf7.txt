Results Of 'Saucer' Hearings Reportedly Kept Secret

WASHINGTON (UP1) â€” A special Air Force intelligence chief reported Saturday that the findings of secret Congressional hearings on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have never been made public. The organization that conducted the hearings, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), insists the Air Force is withholding information about the hearings and the conclusions drawn from them. 

The NICAP said the refusal to make public the results of the hearings "borders on the ridiculous." It added that the public has a right to know what was learned about the nature and origin of the mysterious flying objects.

The NICAP said the hearings were held in October 1955 by a special subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. Air Force officials were called to testify, but the committee report has never been released. 

The organization said that the committee heard testimony from scientists, military pilots and other witnesses who had seen the objects. It said the hearings produced evidence that these objects are real and pose a potential threat to the security of the country.

The NICAP added that the committee was told the Air Force has been unable to identify the objects, determine their origin or explain how they are able to perform the maneuvers they have been observed making. 

The NICAP said it was informed that the committee recommended the Air Force make a full public report on its findings but that this was never done.
