The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, with handwritten text that states:

"The object was at the sight of the gun and fire from the gun."

As an OCR system, I have extracted all the text present in the document, which is:

"Page 6

30.  Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.
Use additional sheets of the same size paper, if necessary."
