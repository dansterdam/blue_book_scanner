The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Gentlemen:

On 9 January 1959, I learned of a report of an Unidentified Flying Object. This report came from Vance AFB, Oklahoma, stating that the UFO had been observed through the control tower's gun-camera. A letter on 9 January 1959, to the Office of Public Information, Vance AFB, requested a copy of the photographs or the film. This information is available, but only from USAF headquarters.

With reference to the above-mentioned report, I grant your request for full information. On 10 January 1959, I received from USAF headquarters the report dated 5 November 1959, and DD5-85-86 dated 9 October 1959. This most certainly did not meet my request for information.

Please return the carbon copy enclosed when you reply.

Sincerely,

Air Force Press Desk
