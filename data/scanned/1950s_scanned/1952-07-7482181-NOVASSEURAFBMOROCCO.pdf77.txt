In a new york time, aug 19 1952, an official report of the united states air force was revealed. They referred to a small strange flying vehicle, about the size of a small automobile, sighted over the novi ligure, italy air force base in morocco by air force observers on july 7, 1952.

It would be a mistake to have any serious speculation about the nature and origin of this object, since very little is known about it. no photographs were taken.
