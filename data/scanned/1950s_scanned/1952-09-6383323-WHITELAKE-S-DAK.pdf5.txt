A Ground Observer Corps post supervisor sighted a brightly burning "stick" or "ball" over White Lake, South Dakota on 14 September 52. The object was observed for 30 to 40 minutes. Several persons in the area also observed the object. The object appeared to be maneuvering and hovering, and at times seemed to get brighter and dimmer. On one occasion it appeared to split into two parts that came back together. No sound was heard, and no smoke or vapor trail was apparent. The object appeared to be at an estimated altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. It moved in an erratic manner and at a rapid rate of speed, and at times hovered in one position. It finally disappeared from sight.
