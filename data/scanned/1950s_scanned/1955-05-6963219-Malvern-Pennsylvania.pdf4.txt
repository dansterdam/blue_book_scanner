3. DATE-TIME GROUP Local 20:30/5/55
5. PHOTOS Yes
6. LOCATION Malvern, Pennsylvania
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION 1-2 minutes 
8. NUMBER OF OBJECTS One (1)
9. COURSE Vertical
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING Intermittent bright light traveling at a speed estimated to be considerable (ground speed estimated 2,000 mph). Light appeared to be emitting flashes of light, and a thunder type sound was noted. During the flight path from south to north-northwest, the object diminished in intensity and finally disappeared. The intermittent light was observed about every twenty (20) degrees from the observer and to the dark sky, no object was visible.
11. COMMENTS Due to the elapsed time of over 1 month between date of sighting and date of this report, the impossibility of further investigation is evident. No investigation authorized by this headquarters. It is possible that the intermittent light was due to the accidental crossing of the sky at a high rate of speed with its running lights flashing on and off.
