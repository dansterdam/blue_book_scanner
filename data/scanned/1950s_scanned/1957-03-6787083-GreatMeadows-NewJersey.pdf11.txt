Affidavit
Even at the risk of being called hysterical, or worse, I feel I must make record, on my oath as a woman, an American, and a member of the human race, of the following:

That I saw an airborne object which bore no resemblance to any aircraft, helicopter or balloon ever made by man, so far as I know.

That I was in full possession of my senses and my sanity at the time, and at all during the time of my seeing this object, which lasted for at least one minute. 

That I saw the object at a distance of not more than 150 yards, at about an 80 degree angle from the horizon. It was a perfect sphere, suspended in the air, and then from out in the back yard of our home on the road from Great Meadows to Hope, New Jersey.

That the weather was clear under a low overcast, and the object remained stationary, aside from the fact that at times it appeared to be expanding from a point to a disc, and at times decreasing to a point again, with concentrated effort to beware and remember every detail.

That my attention was first drawn to the object's presence by our dogs barking in their pens behind the house, and it was their looking upward which attracted my looking upward, where I continued to do so steadily until the object disappeared.
