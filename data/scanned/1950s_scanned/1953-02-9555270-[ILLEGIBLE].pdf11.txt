AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: G-2, 507th ACSW, GS-AFC 929
DATE: 2b FEB 53
SUBJECT: Unidentified Object Sighting

1. Description of Object: The object was described as bright star-like and was larger than a star. It appeared to be in the southern part of the sky at an altitude of 45-50 degrees. There was no luminous trail and it was static, as looking similar to the aircraft landing light. There was no noise associated with the object.

2. Manner of Observation: The object was first sighted at 2100 i/. Observations were made with the naked eye and 7x50 binoculars.

3. Manner of Observation: Four observers were stationed at predetermined positions to observe the object. The observers maintained visual contact until the object disappeared from view, and no estimated distance from their position.

4. Action Taken: The observers were advised as to the proper procedure to follow in plotting the object's position at given intervals for a more accurate location. The object was plotted on a polar grid and its angular elevation was measured with a clinometer. This was done to establish the object's true position and to determine if it was in fact an unidentified flying object.

5. Weather Conditions: Between 2000/I and 2200/I, 26 Feb 53:
Visibility - 8 mi
Wind - Calm
Clouds - 8/10 cover - cirro-stratus and cumulo-nimbus

7. Other Activity: None.
8. Physical Evidence: None.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS,
