Since furnishing you information on 12 May 1959, the additional details have been ascertained pertaining to this incident. However, after thorough examination, no definitive conclusions have been reached. Although all facts surrounding the incident have been carefully scrutinized, pertinent data which would indicate that this sighting was authenticated by technical means has not been found.
