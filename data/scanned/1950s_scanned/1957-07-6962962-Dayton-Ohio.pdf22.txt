The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s.

The text in the document is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand:
(Circle One:) a. Head of a pin b. Pea c. Silver dollar d. Grapefruit e. Basketball f. Other _______

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22:)
a. Certain b. Fairly certain c. Not very sure d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Travel off in straight away.

24. In order that you can give us as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you saw the object that you saw. Of what type of material would you say the object was made? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? If it is an object which could move, how would you visualize its motion? Imagine the most complete and vivid picture you can of the object that you saw.
