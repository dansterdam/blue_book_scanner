EXTRANEOOS INFO.

Dear Sir:

I have your letter of March 4th and I note your inquiry concerning our interest in the unidentified objects sited over Bentwaters and Lakenheath, England on August 13-14, 1956.

These occurrences were of considerable interest to us and we pursued the matter thoroughly. Unfortunately the information obtained was somewhat fragmentary and inconclusive. It would appear that Air Force radar and air defense personnel made repeated visual and radar observations of unidentified objects in the Bentwaters-Lakenheath area on these dates. The objects reportedly displayed high speed, extreme maneuverability and other performance characteristics which could not be readily explained or associated with any known aircraft.

However, while the observations were numerous and made by highly reliable observers, we were unable to obtain data which would positively identify the nature and origin of the objects. The Air Force investigation, while extensive, produced no definitive findings. The possibility that the objects were of extraterrestrial origin was considered but not firmly established.

I regret that I cannot provide you with more definitive information on this intriguing incident. Our knowledge remains limited and inconclusive. If any additional pertinent data should come to light, I will be pleased to inform you.

Sincerely yours,

(redacted)
Chief, ATIC
