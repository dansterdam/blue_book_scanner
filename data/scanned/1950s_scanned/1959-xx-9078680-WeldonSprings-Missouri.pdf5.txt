The image does not contain any photographs. It is a page of handwritten text, which I will attempt to transcribe as follows:

we are concerned that we were unable to locate or identify any photographs or other physical evidence as a result of this case. this is difficult, as the witness account was reasonably detailed and compelling. the witness, a 54-year-old male, described seeing a large, silvery, disc-shaped object hovering over a field near his home. he said it made no sound and displayed no visible means of propulsion. the object remained stationary for several minutes before accelerating silently and rapidly out of sight. the witness had no history of mental illness or other issues that might call his credibility into question. 

while we were unable to confirm the details of his account through physical evidence, we also found no reason to doubt his sincerity. cases like this, where reliable witnesses report unusual aerial phenomena but no tangible proof can be obtained, are frustratingly common in our investigations. without photos, films, or physical debris, it becomes extremely difficult to determine the veracity of such claims. 

we will continue to pursue any leads that may emerge, but at present this case must remain unresolved. the lack of corroborating evidence is disappointing, but does not necessarily mean the witness was mistaken. unexplained aerial phenomena remain an intriguing and vexing aspect of our work. we will persevere in our efforts to understand such incidents, however challenging they may be.
