MEMORANDUM TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE

1. On 23 March 1950 Investigator--, a Civilian, Intelligence Agent, interviewed W. B. Platt, at his place of employment, The B. Altrich Bank Note Works where he is employed as an automobile mechanic.

Platt, N.J., at approximately 7:22 A.M. EDT, observed three bright objects in the sky about three miles west of Tenafly, N.J. He could not tell what was causing the streaks, except he could make out three shiny objects which seemed to be trailing something. The sun was just setting and it appeared to him that the rays of the sun were casting a reflection from the three objects in the sky. These three objects were moving toward the ocean, coming from a southwesterly direction. These three objects were high altitude and made no noise whatsoever. They continued on their course and disappeared toward the ocean.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS: 
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
