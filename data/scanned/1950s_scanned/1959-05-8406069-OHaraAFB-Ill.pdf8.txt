Gentlemen:

On 25 July, 1959, I sent a photograph taken at O'Hare Air Force Base on 27 July, 1959. I mentioned in my original letter that I encountered a strange object in the sky that day.

Somebody photographed this aerial phenomenon was returned to me by Major L. J. Tacker, who said that a committee evaluation considered the object in the photograph to be a cloud formation.

The photo was taken during the Armed Forces Day Air Show. There was nothing visible to the naked eye above the aircraft.

As I said in my earlier letter, I would pass it off as a developing or other natural condition, except for the fact that the object does not continue into the border or the edges of the negative.

Would you please send immediate acknowledgment of receipt of this letter and indicate your evaluation when you have completed your analysis. I wish your evaluation.

Respectfully yours,
[Signature redacted]
