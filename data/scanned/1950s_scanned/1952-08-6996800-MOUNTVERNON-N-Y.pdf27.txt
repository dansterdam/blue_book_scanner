33 JULY 1952

My name is [REDACTED]. I am a Security Guard at WEPG, Las Cruces, New Mexico. On the night of 29 July 1952 at 0315 to 0400 hrs I was on duty at G Station. I was on top of the station checking the equipment. My first observation of an object in the sky was of an object of the approximate size and intensity of a star. Its velocity was similar to a meteor. It did not leave a vapor trail. The light came and went again. It traveled in an approximately thirty to fifty degrees. What aroused my interest was that it set a definite pattern. It started from north east directly overhead to the south east. I next saw it in the south west, next in the north west and back to the north east. It was not a continuous light, it came and went. At first I thought it was a shooting star but I have known of shooting stars to follow a fixed pattern. This pattern continued for about an hour when the object disappeared. I haven't seen a similar light since I fired at night and I have observed weather balloons at night also and jet planes and their velocity was to great to be any of these. I would describe this as a flight pattern rather than an object.

At approximately 0100 hrs on the 30th of July I was on duty at the landing area three miles from my original post at G Station. I observed a similar light. It appeared in a formation of stars in the south west. I would estimate the altitude at approximately 15000 ft., and it appeared at about 20 degrees and disappeared in a cloud formation. I could not estimate the lights or number of the formation.
