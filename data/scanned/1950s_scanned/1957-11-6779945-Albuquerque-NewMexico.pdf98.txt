The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, but it does not contain any visible photograph. The image shows a printed document with rows and columns of text, suggesting it is a table or a form of some kind.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will extract the text from the document:

Albuquerque, New Mexico
