The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it.

The second sketch shows a larger sketch of the position of the object, with an "A" and "B" placed on the curved line to demonstrate how the object's position changed. There is also a small sketch showing an object on the horizon.

The text below the second sketch indicates a scale of 170 to 1 on the horizon and a date of 7-6-'56.
