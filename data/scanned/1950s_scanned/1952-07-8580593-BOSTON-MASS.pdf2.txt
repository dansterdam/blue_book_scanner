The text content of the document is as follows:

"an article which appeared in the Boston Herald of that date, and was of particular interest in view of my interview with the witness Howard L. Everett, whose comments are included. The article indicated that the witness had reported seeing an unusual object in the sky, and had notified the authorities. Based on the article, it appears that the witness described seeing an object that was "saucer-shaped" and that moved rapidly across the sky before disappearing. The article also noted that the witness was considered a reliable and credible source. The handwritten notes on the document provide additional details and commentary, but do not include any information that would identify any individuals mentioned in the case."
