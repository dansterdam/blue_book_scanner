The image contains a photograph that depicts two people, a man and a woman, examining what appears to be a mock-up or model of a "saucer" or UFO object. The photograph is accompanied by a caption that identifies the people as Mrs. William H. Fitzgerald and John Fitzgerald, and states that they are the Sheffield Lake family examining the "saucer".

'Saucer' Terrifies Housewife
Clarence E. Hambly said he was not notified of the sighting and had no reports from anyone.
Both also said that the "saucer" made a whirring sound.
Then, as it left, the "saucer" made a sound like a whistle, increasing in pitch, together with a hum.
Not seen by others, the "saucer" was described as round from a top or bottom view and oval from a side view with a rounded top. It was about eight feet in diameter, they said, and about three feet high.
Mrs. Fitzgerald said it had openings on both sides in which she saw a series of small tubes "like small exhaust pipes."
