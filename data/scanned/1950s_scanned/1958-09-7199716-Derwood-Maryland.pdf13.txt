This memorandum for record of 8 October 1959, concerning the UFO account of 29 September, is attached.

These facts were given a member of the fourth estate in accordance with AFR 200-2:

The Washington Post and Associated Press interpreted these facts. 

On 9 October, Henry Simmons of WENS WINK contacted me and pointed out that he was doing a story on UFOs which would be a credit to the United States Air Force. He desired to get a quote from the newspaper accounts. 

Lieutenant General Besson, on my request, secured a Central Tower Officer - Major General D. L. Putt, Retired. Major General Putt arranged for a brief telephonic conversation with Mr. Simmons. The Military Information Services Officer for Headquarters Command and would be responsible.
