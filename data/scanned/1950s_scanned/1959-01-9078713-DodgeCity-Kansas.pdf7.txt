28 January 1959

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 9 January 1959 concerning your unidentified flying object sighting on 3 January 1959.

The information contained in your letter is insufficient to allow a valid conclusion.

Accordingly, I am inclusing our U. S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet to be filled out and returned direct to Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. They will complete the evaluation.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
