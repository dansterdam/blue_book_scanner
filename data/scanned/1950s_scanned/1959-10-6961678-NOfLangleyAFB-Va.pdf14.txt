MAR 31 1959

Dear Mr. __________,

This is in response to your request of 18 March 1959 in behalf of _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _. 

On 7 February 1959 sightings of the alleged "flying saucers" reported in the area were examined by a team from the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC). The analysis of the sightings by the scientific personnel concerned concluded that the sightings were conventional aircraft. An additional investigation of the 7 February 1959 sightings was initiated by direction of the office of the _______, who assumed it required a more comprehensive study. This study, which is still in progress, has not yet resulted in any findings of an unusual nature.

The incidents of 7 February 1959 were not reported to higher headquarters as unidentified flying objects since the analysis of the sightings by the scientific personnel concerned concluded that they were of a conventional nature. You may be assured that any sightings of unidentified flying objects which cannot be explained in a conventional manner by the technical personnel are reported expeditiously through command channels to higher headquarters along with the best evidence available.

The sightings you have reported would appear to be in the same general category as those of 7 February 1959 which were found to have a conventional explanation. It is hoped that the additional investigation now in progress on the 7 February 1959 sightings may provide further information clarifying this matter. You will be advised of the findings when this investigation has been completed.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
