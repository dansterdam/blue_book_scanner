23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could somehow retrieve the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe to us your idea of a dimension and design of an object which would appear to you as having the same characteristics as the one which you saw.
