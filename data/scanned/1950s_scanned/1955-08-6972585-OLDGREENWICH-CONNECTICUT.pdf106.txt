ITEM X - A MG F OH MEARI FORT CAMPBELL HAD COME OUT TO DO THE SAO THING I HAD HAD DONE LIKE WHAT THIS....TIM.....DRA. AN ARTIST'S CONCEPTION OF THE LITTLE MEH.....BY THIS WAT....HE SOLDIER HAD NOT SEED MY DRAWING......AND WITH....... HE BEGAD PUTTING TOGETHER A DRATIHG THAT VAS HIGHLY SIMILAR TO MINK. THE OUL? HAD PART OF THE WHOLE THING TAS SAYING UP, TOOK OFF E1TC SONE A ID SIMPLY DISAPPEARED. THE ARTIST'S COSCEPIIOM DETAILS... HEAD 'WHICH HO ONE ELSE HAD SEEN, AND THE VAST VARIETY OF FEATURES WITCH NO ONE ELSE HAD EVER DETECTED. = WAS THOROUGHLY ENJOYING HIS POPULARITY.....AT THIS POINT THE DOOR VAS THROWN OPEN......AND HE STOOD R - WHO SCOFFED AND SAID.."WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?". I GOT THE DEFINITE IMPRESSION THAT HIS MOTHER IN LAW ......RS ......HAD PLEAD WITH HIM TO REMOVE ALL SIGHTSEERS FROM THE HOUSE AND SURROUNDINGS AND HE WAS ABOUT TO START WITH US. HOWEVER, BEFORE HE DID ANYTHING ELSE, HIS WIFE STOPPED HIM ONTO THE SMALL DRIVEWAY. LANLING WAS LAYING. WITHOUT SAYING A WORD. HE STAND DOWN, AND ONE COULD TELL FROM THE LOOK ON HIS FACE THAT WE HAD STRUCK HOME WITH THAT PICTURE. HE LOOKED IT OVER, STARTED TO SHAKE HIS HEAD, AND SAID..."NO, THE FACEMASK IS ALMOST LIFE SIZE. IT DOESN'T COME TO A POINT". WE GOT RIGHT TO WORK ON THE SECOND DRAWING, USING THIS FIRST AS A GUIDE, MAKING CHANGES IN THE SECOND AS WE WENT ALONG. AT ONE POINT HE STOPPED UP TO DISCOBE HOT HAD FIRED CF THE APPARITION THE NIGHT 13FORI1, BRINGING THE SHOTGUN DOWN TO BEAR OF THE LITTLE FELLOW...ONLY FEET AWAY.....IN MY JUDGEMENT, IS NOT THE IINE TO BECOME EASILY FRIGHTENED, THAT IS, UNTIL THINGS GET BEYOND THE AVERAGE UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE. THEN THE TWELVE'S CAREEN BEHOLD TO HAVE ALL RESPECT. HE TURNED AND RETREATED INTO THE HOUSE. HE VOLUNTEERED TEE INFORMATION AT THAT POINT, THAT, WHEN THE SHOT STRUCK THE OBJECT, "IT SOUNDED AS THO I HAD BEEN FIRING AT A BUCKET." THE FIPINE PROGRESSED MUCH AS THE FIRST DID.....THE HEAD WAS BALD, ALL AGREED ON THAT. THE CHIN THAT.....SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER WAS ROUND, MAKING THE HEAD AN ALMOST PERFECT CIRCLE. THE MOUTH AS IN THE FIRST CASE, WAS NOT MUCH MORE THAN A LINE STRAIGHT ACROSS THE FACE, AND THE EYES COULDN'T DESCRIBE ANY OTHER OUTSTANDING FEATURES WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THEY WERE FLAPPY, AND CONSIDERABLY TALLER THAN THE WOULD-BE DESCRIPTION HAD INDICATED.
