The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document. It contains a form titled "SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112" that provides details about an investigation. The form does not contain any photographs, but it includes handwritten and typed text providing information about the case.

As an OCR system, I will now output the text found in the document:
