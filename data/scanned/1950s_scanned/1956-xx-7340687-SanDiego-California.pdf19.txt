The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old document or report, possibly related to Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s.

Proposed reply to letter from ________________, 10 February 1967

Dear Mr. _____________,

Please excuse our delay in answering your kind letter of 10 February 1967 in which you reported your unusual observation. 

I am unable to offer much of an explanation at this time without additional information concerning the details of what you could be possible you observed on _____________. These balloons are programmed to fly at approximately 100,000 to 130,000 feet and have often been mistaken for many UFO reports. This, of course, would depend on the details of the observation, wind, date, etc.
