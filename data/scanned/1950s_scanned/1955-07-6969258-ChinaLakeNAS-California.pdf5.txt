STATEMENT OF A02 RICHARD F. LUNDY
S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

When this object was sighted it was moving rapidly to the east. This object was at a high altitude and appeared to be moving steadily at a speed estimated to be less than 800 m.p.h. It appeared to be circular in shape and was very bright, emitting a blue-white light. Its size appeared to be about 25-30 feet in diameter. It was observed through 7x50 binoculars for a period of about 2-3 minutes. The object changed directions abruptly when it was about 25-30 degrees above the horizon and disappeared from sight in a Northeasterly direction. This occurred because the Air Force had requested that we look for an object in that area.
