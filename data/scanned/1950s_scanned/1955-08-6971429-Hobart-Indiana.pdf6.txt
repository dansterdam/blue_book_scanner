Dear Mrs. [redacted],

Thank you for your letter of 15 February 1955. Dr. Hynek is now in La Cruces, New Mexico working at the Smithsonian Observatory, but he has asked that I forward your letter to the Air Force. I am certain that they will be able to clarify your sighting.

Sincerely yours,

Katherine R. Foss
Secretary to the Director
