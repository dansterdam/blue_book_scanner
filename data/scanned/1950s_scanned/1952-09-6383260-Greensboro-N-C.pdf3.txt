Transcription of the text in the document:

On Friday afternoon, September 12, 1952, at dusk my attention was called to an unusual object in the sky. This object was found to shape and white in color with a blinking sequence of a darker color.  It was traveling towards the northwest at a very high rate of speed.

One year was spent instructing machine gun and power turret my overseas duty was 50 missions with the 15th Air Force as Armor gunner.
