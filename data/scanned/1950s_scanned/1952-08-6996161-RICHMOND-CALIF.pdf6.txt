There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed document that appears to be a letter or report from Project Blue Book, a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the 1950s.

The text in the document is as follows:

"Crimes appear to flatten out spread about 15 minutes later. There are no available photographs and a few sightings for the report to date. If any more significant data can be obtained, I will be glad to submit additional details.

In closing may I add that I believe daily the number of sightings we report to reach 500 during 1950 and more sightings are coming in daily. However, at this time I believe we should discontinue sending reports that offer little or no information that would assist in determining the nature of the objects sighted.

I sincerely hope this will help to clear up at least one of the hundreds of reports you must receive.

Sincerely,
Ronald T. Brown"
