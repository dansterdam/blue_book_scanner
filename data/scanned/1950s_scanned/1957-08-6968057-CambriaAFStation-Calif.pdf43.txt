Dear Major Keyhoe:

Your letter of 27 August 1957 addressed to the Senior Public Information Division, Headquarters USAF, was forwarded to this office for reply. Your request for information concerning the unidentified aircraft observed over New Jersey on 16 August 1957, has been referred to the USAF for comments.

Please enclosed are attachments to this letter. Materials in the files please answer your inquiries. Further, be assured that no information indicative of a direct sighting has been received.

On the evening of 16 August 1957, First Lieutenant Robert E. Williams, U. S. Air Force, observer, and Mr. Charles G. Williams, U. S. Air Force, handler, in the F-89 aircraft, observed in the vicinity of Cape May, New Jersey, a bright light which they reported as an unidentified flying object. Following this, further investigation was conducted. Detailed information concerning this incident and the conclusions reached, if any, are not available in this office.

In the future I would suggest you direct letters to this office for reply.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
