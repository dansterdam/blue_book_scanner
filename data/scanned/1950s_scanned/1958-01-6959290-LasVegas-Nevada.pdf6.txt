On 23 January, 1958, the writer interviewed Charles Irvington, who reported sighting three unidentified objects near Orlando, Florida, on 24 January, 1958. The following information was obtained:

At approximately 8:50 p.m. on 24 January, 1958, the witness, who was driving alone on Route 441 between Orlando and Kissimmee, Florida, observed three bright lights in the sky to the northeast. The objects appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and made no sound. The witness stated that the objects seemed to be moving in a triangular formation, but he could not determine their exact shape or size. The lights were visible for approximately 1 minute before disappearing from view.

The witness reported that the objects were brightly illuminated and appeared to be elliptical in shape. He was unable to make a positive identification of the objects, but stated that they were definitely not aircraft, helicopters, or airships. The witness also reported that the objects seemed to be maneuvering and changing direction at a high rate of speed.

The witness was interviewed at his home by the writer and appeared to be a reliable individual. There were no other reports of similar sightings in the area at that time. The USAF records indicate no known aircraft or other aerial activity in the vicinity of Orlando, Florida, on the date and time in question.

The report of this sighting is forwarded for your information and further analysis.
