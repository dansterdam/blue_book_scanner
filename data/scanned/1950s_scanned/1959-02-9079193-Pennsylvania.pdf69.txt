The image appears to contain a typed document discussing a UFO sighting by a pilot named Killian. The document describes Killian witnessing a high-altitude jet aircraft over Lake Erie, which he initially thought was an airliner but then noticed it was changing positions, suggesting it was an unidentified flying object. The document mentions that Killian called the object's movements to the attention of his co-pilot and that they both observed the object for several minutes. The document also mentions that other airline pilots in the area reported similar sightings around the same time.

Here is the text transcribed from the document:

SAUCERS TRAIL AIRLINERS

At one time Killian thought he was witnessing a high altitude jet returning to an airport but the varying and changing position of the objects made him lose that theory. 

In addition, Killian kept watch on his radar but saw nothing on it.

When his plane was over Erie, Pu. Killian called his co-pilot and asked if any other airline crews in the area could see the objects. Captains answered. One, a little north of Killian's plane, said he had been watching the objects for 10 to 15 minutes. The other was located to the west.

After Killian's call and seen the UFO's, meanwhile, although Killian did not know it at the time, three United Airlines planes along a similar route had also seen the lights. Capt. A.D. Waters and his Flight Engineer told Killian later he had observed the objects between Lockhaven, Pa. and Youngstown, Ohio. United Flights 237 and 321 also observed the objects and their crews discussed the sightings by radio with the United Airlines Office out of Newark. The Akron GPO Research Group also reported receiving reports.

There was general agreement that the objects were holding to a "formation." After he had begun his descent, Killian said the objects had begun to dim and had "seemed to break up into a formation."

The color of the lights changed.
