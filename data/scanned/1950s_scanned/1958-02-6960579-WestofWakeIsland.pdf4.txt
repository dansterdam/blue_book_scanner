Identification:
Aircraft No.: USAF 50-1178, Call Sign 41018.
Air Refueling: Air refueling by fighter, estimated to be complete at 1550Z.
Remarks: 1. Crew, navigator (call sign 41018).
2. Co-pilot: Lt. R. J. Garretty, 0-1727857, 41st Air Refueling Sq, pilot, refueling (call sign 41018).
3. Pilot: Capt. J. H. Parks, 0-763373, 41st Air Refueling Sq, pilot, refueling.
4. Navigator: Capt. G. L. Ballinger, 0-878898, 41st Air Refueling Sq, navigator.
5. Tanker: SAC, KC-97, S/N 52-0726, 43rd Air Refueling Sq, refueling (call sign 43).

Wind: 360, 20 kts. Cloud cover a 3/10 scattered well below 18,000 ft. altitude.
1. Winds aloft (recorded at wake island 1312-1322Z): 5,000 ft. - 320/20, 10,000 ft. - 330/35, 20,000 ft. - 330/45.
2. Clouds: 2/10 at 2,500', visibility unrestricted.
3. Ceiling: 3,000 scattered.
4. Visibility: plus 15 knots.
5. Cloud cover: 2/10 at 2,000'.
6. Thunderstorms: None.

Unusual activities:
1. The aircraft spent a considerable length of time in a stationary position with respect to the tanker during the refueling operation.
2. The refueling time was unusually long, which could be attributed to the unusual practice of an observation aircraft accompanying the operation. The aircraft on this occasion matched the description and capabilities of a USAF F-101 Voodoo interceptor. This aircraft accompanied the air refueling operation throughout but maintained a safe distance and did not interfere with the refueling operation.
