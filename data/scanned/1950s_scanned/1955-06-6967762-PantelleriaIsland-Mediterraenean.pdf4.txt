There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document, which appears to be a report or notes about a UFO sighting.

The text in the document states:

"It is U.S. agency and they had received a report of something unusual. 2 Believe it was of brighter and slightly luminous like flame and went like 30 to 50 times, but the time it took to clear in about 20 to 30 seconds. Got a clear observation of what seem an unidentified flying object, moved in a steady straight line. I don't believe in dangers on possible UFO reports, we saw nothing from other side that would indicate that. I was experianced it. UFO reports.

Yours truly
