The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document that appears to be a Project Blue Book report. I will now proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text in the document and provide the full transcribed text output.

OBJECT: PLANE CRAFT VERSUS JET AIRCRAFT, AS TOLD TO THE NEW YORK JOURNAL-AMERICAN OF THE PAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS PILOT WHO SIGHTED A COLLISION BETWEEN A LUMINOUS FLYING OBJECT THAT VEERED INTO HIS PATH.

EARLY CAPTION: "IT PRECEDED BY 200 YARDS FROM ME VERY SHARPLY SATURATED. IT was DISTRIBUTED BY INTERNATIONAL NEWS SERVICE IT LOOKS LIKE A MOST DUN HUNDRED YARDS, BUT AS TO WHAT IT WAS, I HAVE LESS AN IDEA TODAY THAN WHAT IT REALLY BEFORE TRIED TO EVADE AND HIGH SPEED IT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT.

"IT" WAS LACONICALLY DESCRIBED AS A UFO- "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT" IN A RADIO REPORT RELAYED TO EASTERN AIR DEFENSE FORCE HEADQUARTERS BY A CIVIL AERONAUTICS ADMINISTRATION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER WHICH MONITORED THIS REPORT. TASK FORCE, ACCOMPANIED BY A RADAR PLANE, WAS SENT ALOFT TO INVESTIGATE. FROM A STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND FIGHTER BASE IN THE SOUTH, IT ANY ARE CLASSIFIED.

SIMILAR SIGHTINGS IN THE PAST HAVE LATER BEEN EXPLAINED WHEN SEEN THROUGH AN ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING, AT WHICH TIMES "MIRAGES" HAVE BEEN OBSERVED.

TO BE ALTITUDE 15,000 FOOT ALTITUDE, WHICH COULD HAVE MADE IT APPEAR LARGER THAN IT REALLY WAS.

IMPRESSION WAS THAT THE OBJECT LOOKED LIKE A BIT SPOTLIGHT SHINING CLEARLY IN THE DARK-SEEMING CLOUDINESS, AND AS I KNOW IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

HE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO GET A GOOD LOOK AT IT, SPOTTED IT THE SAME INSTANT HE DID, THAT IS HEAR HIS BREATH BY CO-PILOT. READING ON INSTRUMENTS SHOWED THAT IT WAS GOING FASTER THAN HIS PLANE.

AS YOU HAVE PERHAPS A SECOND BEFORE. IT WAS BEWILDERED, BY REFLEX AND INSTANTLY-OF PASSENGER SAFETY IN YOUR HANDS. BE PREPARED SOMETHING LIKE THIS:
THROUGH PERIODIC RADIO REPORTS INTERCEPTED MUST BE ERRONEOUS. I HAD THOUGHT OF JETS BY REFLEX BECAUSE HERE UNUSUAL FROM A JET EXHAUST PROBABLY IS RULE OUT AN INTERCEPT AGAIN IN THE SAME SPLIT SECOND IT RULED OUT AN INTERCEPT BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS COME AT LEAST 20 MILES SOME PULLING ALONGSIDE OF YOU READY FOR ACTION, THE OTHER THROWING A SPOTLIGHT ON YOUR IDENTIFICATION MARKINGS AND FLASH OUT WHO YOU ARE.

THIS REPORTING ROUTE WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THESE BLUNDERS FROM BECOMING A DEFENSE IDENTIFICATION ZONE, WHICH STRETCHES MILES OUT TO SEA, IS NOT AFTER REASONING THIS OUT, I FELT THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING FOR ME TO DO TO SAVE 55 PASSENGERS AND CREW, THAT WAS TO PULL UP SHARPLY.

I HAD BEEN ON INSTRUMENT LIGHT UNTIL MINUTES BEFORE I SAW THE OBJECT, AND IT WAS PITCH BLACK OUTSIDE. I WAS IN ROUTINE COMMUNICATION WITH FIVE OTHER PAN AMERICAN PLANES, AN EASTERN AIRLINES PLANE CARRYING A TRANS-CARIBBEAN PLANE TAIL OF WHICH WERE HEADED FOR NEW YORK AT THE TIME.
