It is considered that of the three possible methods outlined above, PROPOSAL II will yield the best results. This proposal leaves the responsibility for Project Blue Book activities with this Center, but it provides both the authoritativeness of a high level spokesman and the technical capabilities, in all scientific fields, of a reputable contractor. It is further considered that Hand Corporation, if available, would most adequately fulfill the contractual requirements. We propose, if no objections exist, to attempt implementation of PROPOSAL II.
