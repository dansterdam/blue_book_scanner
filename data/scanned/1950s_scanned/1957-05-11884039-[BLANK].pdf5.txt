SUBJ: Publication of UFO Special Report Nr. 14

TO: Director, AFOIN-H

1. The attached proposed revision of AFR 200-2 is submitted for final coordination. It USAF coordination has been accomplished and since changes originated with AFSC have been incorporated, the Regulation is considered ready for publication.

2. No substantive changes have been made to the most recent ATIC revision which would vitiate the purpose for accomplishing the revision - other than reducing the number of included Air Force names and clarifying certain security, the most recent changes attempt to provide authorization for any and all Regulations required by the public. As pointed out, because of public interest in UFOs, the subject should eventually be out of content might reflect an unfavorable change in Air Force Policy and therefore should be compiled with extreme caution.

3. The subject of U.S. persons using the UFO hysteria for personal gain has been thoroughly reviewed for this and other proposals. It is our considered opinion that to arouse public interest in UFOs would be inadvisable since this would likely be exploited by AFOIN-H and further development will be brought to your attention.

4. Concurrently with the publication of Report Nr. 14, as an Air Force Pamphlet, the publication of AFR 200-2, revised, should do much toward the relief of AFOIN in the UFO program.
