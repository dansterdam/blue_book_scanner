The image does not contain any photographs; instead, it features a technical drawing of a hemispherical dome with labeled angles and directions. It includes markings for degrees from 0 to 90 at the zenith, with horizontal lines intersecting at 30°, 60°, and 90° intervals. The compass directions such as South (180°), Southeast (135°), East (90°), etc., are indicated around the base of the dome along with degrees. The perimeter has small figures, possibly representing trees and one human figure standing at the left side at the 270° W mark. 

No OCR text is included in the image itself.
