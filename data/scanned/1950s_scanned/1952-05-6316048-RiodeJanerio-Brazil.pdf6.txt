The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text Extracted from the Document:

(a) If the information was not reported until late 1952 (the time persons gained from the report), it is possible that Mr. Douville was not present and was not aware of the publicity given until much later. The incident was apparently fairly well publicized in the local papers at the time, and the object was sufficiently observed to warrant press coverage.

Additional information on the case is rather meager, and no photograph or other physical evidence was recovered. (Captain Douville, 28 May 54, AFOIR-Z35)
