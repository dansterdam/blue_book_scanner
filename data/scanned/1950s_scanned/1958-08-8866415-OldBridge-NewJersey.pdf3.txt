   1. There is very little information in Mr. and Mrs.       letter on 
          which to base a valid conclusion. However,^the following is submitted on which to 
          base a reply: 
/	a. At 9:00 P.M., EST, 27 August 1958, the star Alphertz, which is a 
          second magnitude star, was in the northeast, approximately 30 degrees above the 
          horizon. 
/	b. At 9:00 P.M., EST, same day, the planet Mars was just beginning to 
          appear above the northeastern horizon. 
/ c. In an area where there are a lot of exhaust fluzes of all types, as in 
          the observer's case, the heavenly bodies appear to play all sorts of tricks. 
/         d. It is the opinion of this office that the observers were looking at one 
          of the bodies mentioned above.
