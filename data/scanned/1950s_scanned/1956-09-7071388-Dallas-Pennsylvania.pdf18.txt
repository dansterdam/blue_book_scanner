Case 222. Williston, N. D. Sept 22, 1956 - The witness, from the Williston plane reporter, as follows: "It was just about sunset, and Mr. and Mrs. Reese had stopped to view the sunset. As they were standing there, Mr. Reese observed an object high in the sky. He called Mrs. Reese's attention to it, and she also saw it. It was low enough that they could actually see its movement, and they estimate it was around 120 miles an hour. This object appeared to be dropping straight down, hovering for a few seconds, and then taking off in a northward direction at a high rate of speed. Both Mr. and Mrs. Reese were amazed at the speed and maneuvers of this object. They watched it for several minutes until it disappeared from view. Saturday night about 7:20 o'clock Mr. Reese said he was startled by a bright light in the sky. The light appeared to be moving at a tremendous rate of speed, and at intervals it would "blink" off and on. Mr. Reese appeared to follow the course of the light until it disappeared over the horizon in a northward direction. The light was estimated to have been visible for about 30 seconds, and appeared to him to be about the size of a baseball. This light did not seem to make any sound, and Mr. Reese could not determine the altitude or speed of the object. After the light disappeared, Mr. Reese mentioned this incident to his wife, and she stated she did not observe the light, as she had been watching television at the time."
