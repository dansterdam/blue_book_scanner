the object (based on disappearance at 25,000') is estimated as follows:

Original sighting - 4,610' away (horizontal), at 5,100' altitude. 
At disappearance - 9,100' away (horizontal), at 25,000' altitude.

Identifying information on observer. The observer is an intelligent, well-informed high school student, aged 16, who is, although not well-versed in aerodynamics nor in meteorological phenomena, an observer of the sky and has been previously interested in the question of "flying saucers" and the authenticity of their existence.

NAME: -----
AGE: 16 years
ADDRESS: Mishawaka, Indiana.

Weather: 
The following weather information was obtained from Bendix Field, South Bend, Indiana, which is approximately 5 miles to the northwest of the observer.

Ceiling: 5,000 feet 
Visibility: 7 miles
Temperature: -15 degrees. 
Dew Point: 22Â° at 15.
Winds - 22.1h.

The weather observer on duty at Bendix Field on the night of 9 April 1952 reported unusual objects (or objects) in the sky. Receiving calls on this nature, he gave his opinion a somewhat light reflection on the clouds. The color of this reflection was white.

COMMENT: The observer of the red object was definite about the fact that the object was rapidly moving and gaining altitude. The shining on a cloud would give the effect of the reverse of this. Also the outline of the object was clearly the outline of the clouds. For this reason I am skeptical about the authenticity of this sighting.
