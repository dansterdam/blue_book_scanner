Saucers Sighted
Raleigh, N. C., Monday Morning, July 3, 1950.

Four people, local residents, reported yesterday morning they had seen several "saucer-like" objects in a northwesterly direction. They were described as silvery and metallic in appearance, but did not appear to be moving with windows. As the objects moved, they tilted and flashed as though rotating. The witnesses could not estimate their altitude, no could they give an idea of their size. The formation of three or four objects was accompanied by a peculiar humming sound.

The objects were observed for several minutes from a big home on Poole Boyce Avenue where the witnesses were standing.
