THE KEARNEY INCIDENT                                                                                        43

it up to the quarry and we will take 
the Buick along." I told them it 
really wasn't necessary because I 
could leave it at a garage, for the 
car weighs about two tons and it 
would be a lot of extra weight. Their 
reply was_ "Weight doesn't mean 
anything." 
       I made my telephone calls and 
then drove out to the quarry. I saw 
that the ship was already there. It 
was a larger ship than I had seen 
before, being about two hundred feet 
long. forty feet wide, and fourteen 
feet in height. Other than size and 
the fact that it contained a few less 
instruments, this ship was almost 
identical in appearance and furnish- 
ings with the ship I saw near Kear- 
ney, Nebraska. The personnel was 
the same. 
       There is'a large eighteen or twenty 
feet steel galvanized tank beside my 
quarry, fed by a spring, which was 
placed there by the Government for 
animals such as deer and cattle to 
drink from. The space people had 
drawn about half of the water from 
the tank * probably fourteen or fif- 
teen barrels. The space people use 
water in the ship to keep it cool. 
         As soon as I arrived, they let the 
ramp down on the fore End of the 
ship and I drove the Buick up on 
it; they lifted the ramp * and wd 
started for the North Pole! 
         We left the quarry at 4:15 in the 
afternoon. An hour and twenty min- 
utes later we were over the Arctic 
Circle, having made three stops, one 
in Greenland for about thirty min- 
utes, and two short stops in Alaska 
to check on some minerals. At one 
time during the flight I asked them 
how fast the ship could go. They 
answered that they would give me 
a fast ride. At that time we were 
approximately six or seven miles 
high, and for a few minutes, accord- 
ing to an instrument which I would 
call a speedometer, we went 40,000 
miles an hour. They said the craft 
would go a lot faster but that we 
did not have enough distance to 
really turn it loose. There was no 
vibration, and the only way I could 
tell we had gone so high was the 
appearance of the earth below us. 
The earth was almost obscured by 
what appeared to be rings similar 
to those we see around the planet 
Saturn. The predominant color was 
blue-green showing through the sil- 
very rings of haze. This same ship 
can be used as a plane in the air, a 
ship on the water, or a submarine 
beneath the Water. While in the air 
the ship flew broadside. 
        As we were flying over the Arctic 
Circle they pointed out many inter- 
esting things. They showed me a 
place where once there were icecaps 
a thousand or so feet high. Today it 
is a lake. They told me this was 
caused by atomic bombs changing 
our atmosphere so that it is be- 
coming warmer in some places and 
colder in others. The Arctic Circle, 
has been cold for thousands of years, 
but today the ice is receding. 
        We settled down on the open wa- 
ter, then submerged beneath the ice- 
cap to a depth of approximately 
three or four hundred feet, where 
we remained for three or four hours. 
While underneath the surface of 
the water I saw something which  
has never yet been revealed to the 
ublic. I have written to Washing. 
on asking permission to give out 
this information but at the date of 
Writing this report I have heard 
nothing from the Pentagon. Assum- 
ing there is no reason for further 
secrecy, I will give this Information 
now: 
       We observed two Russian sub- 
marines which were mapping the 
floor of the ocean in order to build 
missile bases from which they could 
fire missiles to any part of the world, 
without sound and without warn-
