The image contains three sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with rays emanating from one end, representing an object in the sky. The second sketch shows a landscape view with buildings and trees, and the third sketch shows a silhouetted figure against a horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
