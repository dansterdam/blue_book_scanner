Dear Sir:
I have been advised by an expert that an observation carried on in August 18,1959 of a meteor like object may be worthwhile recording.
At 19h 10m G.C.T., on the above date, an object was sighted at the zenith of its angular flight. The calculated apparent velocity was 120,000 miles per hour and a height of 120,000 feet. At the same time of the observation a noise was heard which would resemble frying.The object was shell like in shape and traveled directly over LAT. 39° 28' 00" and LONG. 87° 25' 00" South - East to North - West. No trail or impact noise flash was detected.
The observation was witnessed.
Sincerely
