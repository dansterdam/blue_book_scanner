AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

15 2110 hours, 26 February 1953, D/F called operations and told us about a red light in the sky. He had observed it for approximately 2 minutes. It was moving out at a fast clip. It went up and down and made a 360 degree turn. It was a blinking light which seemed to be about 15-20 miles away. He could not judge the size or altitude. When the light went out, he called the Japanese guard and asked him if he had seen it. The guard said yes and that he thought it might be a jet. This caused the D/F to call us.
There were two (2) planes in the sky. So we asked the D/F if either one of them had the light. He said no, these were standard aircraft. So we questioned him further about the one he had observed. According to the information he gave us, this did not sound like a normal aircraft light. He reported this to us. This compared to 1137 hours.
At 2219 and 2258 hours, we had two distinct surface-to-air missile firings. The first one was visible on the scope but the second one could not be traced as the observation area was about 25 miles away. We could not determine if these were related to the light that was observed at 2110 hours.
About 2300 hours, the D/F called again and said he had observed the light again and this time he said it seemed to be traveling at about ten (10) feet in diameter when it observed it again. They told us if we came, we could get a picture of it.
About 0305 hours, W/C had got three (3) reports that very interesting information about an object at 2238 hours. This was flashed at 2245 hours. The flash was visible for about 10 seconds only. We flashed at 2219 hours and was identified as surface-to-air missile firing. D/F called and told us that sergeant had seen three (3) of the same sort of lights that had been observed earlier.
