1. In accordance with letter AFDIN-C/CC-2, subject: "Reporting
of Information on Unidentified Flying Objects," Headquarters United
States Air Force, dated 16 December 1949, and Eighth Air Force "TOP
SECRET" dated 1 March 1952, as revised, the following are submitted for your
information:

a. AAF Form 112, Report No. 509-79-1, forwarded in five (5)
copies and inclosed as Inclosure No. 1.

b. AAF Form 112, Report No. 509-79-2, forwarded in five (5)
copies and inclosed as Inclosure No. 2.

2. AAF Form 112, Report No. 509-79-1 raises a doubt that a D-9,
which Reading, on 7 March 1952, claimed by the pilot to have encountered
a D-2, was a conventional aircraft. The reporting officer considers
closure* of the Unidentified Flying Object from this (3) times the
speed of a D-9 type aircraft to indicate that a conventional
fighter - the original report was submitted based on interrogation
of the D-50 case by a Wing Intelligence Officer, indicates a questionable
conclusion. The report was believed conclusive enough to substantiate a high
priority intelligence report.
