"I don't know what to think. This thing is happening! There is a great brilliance approaching parallel with the horizon. It follows a zig-zag course and then began to slow down and disappear. This was the signal of a space ship from another world. We had contented ourselves that this was perhaps the signal of an experimental aircraft. It was suddenly near us, we wondered. Did they, the signal, come from the other group calling us? They, too, had made contact with an enormous illuminating object maneuvering just over the horizon parallel with the earth. A member of the other group also had seen the bright light in the sky. When both groups were together, a messenger - a space ship - would approach us around their object and then it would vanish again. As it drew near us, it appeared as a solid disk over the gulf. It seemed to be intelligently controlled with perfect maneuvers. A light glowed around it and it suddenly disappeared. One even watched it leave us.
'We were dazed and confused. From meeting world, it was apparent if they had a desire to be friendly, theirs must be a different life than ours. But then, if they had a desire to be hostile, our lives would be in great danger. We experienced a feeling of mixed emotions during the craft's approach, and each time the object would mysteriously disappear and reappear, we became more tense. This time it hovered. What strange life forms inhabit this craft no one can determine.'
