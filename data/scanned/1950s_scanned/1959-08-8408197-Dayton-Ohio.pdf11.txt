The image provided appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page contains a typed text describing an incident, but there is no photograph present on this page.

The text in the document is as follows:

"To be truthful the first report I recorded was not recorded before they had made their presence known to the observer. At the scene of this activity a triangularly lighted object was observed hovering at tree top level for approximately 2320 to 2330 hours. This object was approximately 30 to 50 feet in diameter and at an altitude of approximately 150 to 200 feet. The object was observed to be illuminated with a bright white light which seemed to be emitting from the whole body of the object. No structural details could be distinguished. As the observer was observing the object it was noted that it was slowly moving in a northerly direction. After several minutes of observation the object accelerated rapidly and disappeared from sight in a northerly direction."
