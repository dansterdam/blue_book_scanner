THE SHIP ON A CONSTANT COURSE AND USING REC- TANGULAR BRIGHT LIGHTS AS A POWER PLANT
THE OBJECT MOVED PAST THIS WITNESS AT ABOUT 20 DEGREES PER SECOND.
"THIS OBJECT WAS PECULIAR IN THAT IT HAD
THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A HALO AROUND IT WITH
A DARK UNDERSURFACE. IT CROSSED RAPIDLY AND
THEN GLOWED DOWN AND STARTED TO CLIMB IN
LAZY CIRCLES SLOWLY. THE PATTERN IF MADE WAS
LIKE A FALLING OAK LEAF INVERTED. IF YOU
THOUGH THESE GYRATIONS FOR A COUPLE MINUTES
AND THEN WITH A VERY RAPID ACCELERATION DIS- APPEARED TO THE EAST. THIS OBSERVER, DICK AND I
WATCHED FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES.
"I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE ITS SIZE,
BECAUSE AT THE TIME I DIDN'T HAVE THE BALLOON
SIGHT FOR A COMPARISON.
"SHORTLY AFTER THIS WE SAW ANOTHER ONE,
BUT THIS ONE DIDN'T SHINE AROUND. IT
APPEARED FROM THE WEST AND DISAPPEARED TO
THE EAST. NEITHER ONE LEAVING ANY TRACE OF
VAPOR TRAIL.
"WHEN I SAW THE SECOND ONE I CALLED OUR
OTHER STATION AT ANTIOCH AND THE
OBSERVERS THERE ON THE THEODOLITE MANAGED TO
GET GLIMPSES OF A NUMBER OF THEM, BUT COULDN'T
KEEP THE THEODOLITE GOING FAST ENOUGH TO KEEP
THEM IN THE FIELD OF THEIR INSTRUMENT. SOME
OF THEIR TIME AND DICK REPORT CAUSED GLIMPSES OF
THESE OBJECTS IN THE THEODOLITE AFTER X
NOTIFIED THEM OF THEIR PRESENCE BY RADIO.
ED GRAY ITEM 511174."
