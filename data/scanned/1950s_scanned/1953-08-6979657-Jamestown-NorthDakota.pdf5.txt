I sighted a red and white object and saw a morning light that could hardly be made of any normal objects. I could easily see that it was not normal. I circled around it to see if it had additional lights. I had a feeling that I was watching a nonsense. I was then greatly surprised to see the rather long straight tail come on the right almost instantaneously and the whole thing suddenly started to move rapidly and disappeared. I was watching it for a few minutes and thought it might be a airplane. But I finally decided that it could not be an airplane as it had an unusual tail and was flying at a very high speed and disappeared at high speed.
