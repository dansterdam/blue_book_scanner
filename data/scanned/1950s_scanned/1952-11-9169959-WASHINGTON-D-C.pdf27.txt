A secret space war?
The green fireballs of 1948 could be a brand new kind of meteor, according to the Mathematics and Astronomy department at the University of New Mexico. They say the green fireballs are more brilliant and bigger than the moon, and that ordinary fireballs are rarely this impressive.

The green fireballs could be thrown by man-made guided missiles, or they could be "ghost-like" where big meteors penetrating our atmosphere always have curved trajectories, according to Dr. Lincoln LaPaz.

Most unusual of all is their green color. The fireballs, as green as a traffic light or neon sign, are absolutely rare.

Conservative observers pointed out that the green fireballs as magnetic field meteors, which they often describe as "Lucifers".

If the green fireballs are meteors, they are of an unidentified type, and their coming may mean that the solar system (including our earth) has been invaded from the outer corners of the universe. This, it is suggested, could occur.

Again, because of the nearness of U.S. scientific centers, the temptation is great to say they're ours. But Dr. LaPaz says: "If the Russians possessed missile capable of continental flight, it would be natural for them to want to test it by sending it across the skies of the United States."
