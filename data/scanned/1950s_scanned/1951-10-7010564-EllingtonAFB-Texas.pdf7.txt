Report of Information on Unconventional Aircraft

The following information regarding the sighting of an unconventional aircraft is forwarded as a matter of interest pertaining to your Center:

A. Source

Graduate physicist, no aircraft experience, age 29, member permanent staff Battelle Memorial Institute.

Date of Sighting: Tuesday evening, October 2, 1951.
Ground Detail: weather clear; sun behind a building and could not be seen; darkness just beginning to set in.

At the time of the sighting, a twin-engine aircraft - probably a DC-3 scheduled airliner - was observed. The source was seated in a car in a parking lot on the campus of The Ohio State University. The DC-3 was heading directly east with an estimated altitude of 1000 feet.

The unidentified object was heading directly west at an altitude higher than that of the DC-3. The exact altitude cannot be estimated. The attached drawing shows the source's opinion of what he saw as far as configuration of the unconventional aircraft. No sounds were heard associated with this identifiable object. The pattern of flight seemed straight with no change in altitude or maneuver. The duration of the sighting was approximately one minute.
