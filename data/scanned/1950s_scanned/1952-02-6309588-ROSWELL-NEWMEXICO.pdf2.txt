FLYING SAUCER THEORY EXPLODED:
MYSTERY OF BALL OF FIRE SOLVED

By JAMES ELLIOT

Remembering that taking the fantastic thoughts of flying saucers and some connected theories told us only about the limits of imagination rather than real facts, this report today discloses what the phenomenon really was - a "ball of fire."

Last February, the phenomenon was sighted several times. And since that time, astronomical thoughts have increased rather than diminished. Why? Because the reports, which on their face seemed to be of "flying saucers," have now been traced to a "ball of fire" - something more rational and less fantastic than the saucer theory.

BASED ON THE ACCOUNTS

According to the accounts, this "ball of fire" was seen only for a few seconds by observers in at least three states who saw the brilliant flash-like glow which part of the world's scientists said was impossible. From that point, two miles south of Buffalo City, N.C., it is stated the "ball of fire" flashed into sight at 11:34 A.M. and was visible to residents of three states despite the clear Chesapeake Bay weather. It fell into the bay, the report said, about 15 minutes before disappearance.
