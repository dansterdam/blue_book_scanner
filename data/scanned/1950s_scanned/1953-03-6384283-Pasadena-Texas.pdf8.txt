AF FORM 112 - PART II
15 NOVEMBER 1952

747th AC & W SQ

At 0352 Z, Lt R K Smith called Pase Operations and reported the following: (See statement)
Lt Smith's statement: I was on AG 747/AC & W SQ when at approximately 0352 Z I observed an unidentified object traveling at extremely high speed. The object was traveling in a straight line and appeared to be about 15-20 degrees above the horizon. The object was illuminated and seemed to be about one degree in size. It traveled for approximately 1 minute and then seemed to disappear. There was no sound and the object displayed no red, green, or navigation lights. I immediately called Pase Operations and made the following statement.

The unidentified object electronically. We went out side and sighted the object using the SCR-584 Radar. The object's speed was indicated to be in excess of 1200 mph. The object was on a heading of 25 degrees and was at an altitude of approximately 25,000 ft. It flew for a distance of approximately 30 miles and then disappeared from the radar screen.
The object was visually sighted at approximately 0352 Z. It was a clear night with unlimited visibility. The observer stated that the object was definitely not an aircraft of any type and expressed the opinion that it must have been a guided missile or a meteor. The object was sighted visually at 0352 Z and the radar observation was from 0352 Z to 0353 Z. This station notified the 25th Air Div, AC & W Sq at 0355 Z.

Release of weather balloons at approximately the time of the sightings. One 2000 gram balloon was released at 0330 Z and one 1200 gram balloon was released at 0400 Z. These were routine releases and climbed at rates of 1000 ft per min.

This is for the record of the two weather balloons
From surface to 5,000 ft track was SW due to NE wind at 10 Knots. 
From 5,000 ft to 10,000 ft track was NW due to NW wind at 40 Knots.
From 10,000 ft to 15,000 ft track was NW due to NE wind at 50 Knots.
From 15,000 ft to 25,000 ft track was NW due to NE wind at 60 Knots.

Weather balloons released after dark carry a 6 volt battery.
Visual observation from approximately 12,000 feet revealed a picture of which there are no further details. There were no after affects of this visual observation.

The unidentified weather balloons sightings has disclosed since the radiosondes is lighted at night it is considered possible that the collision might be misconstrued as the orbited movement of an unknown aerial object.
