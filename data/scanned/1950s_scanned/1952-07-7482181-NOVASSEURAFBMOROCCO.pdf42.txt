The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. I will now act as an OCR system and output all the text found in the document:

Project Blue Book report, NOVASSEURAFBMOROCCO, July 7, 1952
[Redacted]
The lights were first observed at approximately 2145 hours on 7 July 1952 by the Novasseur AFB control tower operator and several other base personnel. The lights were observed to the west of the base at an estimated altitude of approximately 5,000 feet and were moving in a southwesterly direction at an estimated speed of 500 miles per hour. The lights were described as being whitish in color and were visible for approximately 3 to 5 minutes before disappearing. No sound was heard and the lights exhibited no trail.
