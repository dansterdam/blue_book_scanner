He replied, the color was a blueish green color much the same as a luminous watch with a metallic edge. The color of the object was similar to a quick glow. There was said to be a queer sound of a running light motor, used to vibrate strongly in the house.
The shape of the object was so hard to describe, something about the size of a wash tub, round and mostly flat, with a flare at the bottom. The witness said it must have been thirty feet across. 
He was then asked about vision into the object or seeing any people or things about the object. The answer was he had seen nothing nor could he.
Mr. --- was then asked why he was absent for a whole day and night after this happened. He explained of his fears of the doings and the general attitude of his friends and fellow workers.
He was then asked if he had forgotten to mention anything else that might give some light on the investigation or these matters. He said no, that was all he knew and saw.
Asked, how he was told this interview and gave this account of the incident. He explained he was first noticed by a neighbor who came when he called to 15th street where he had come. According to the neighbor, he then returned to his home, shut in his house and wouldn't discuss the incident for quite a time. Some days later, since the local police and some authorities called on him, he then gave them this report which is now being recorded. The report states that the object was about 30 feet across, had a blue green metallic color and flashed lights as it hovered near the ground.  The witness also said he heard a humming sound from the object. The document states that the object was observed by the witness for about 20 to 30 minutes and then disappeared from sight. That is all the text found in the document.
