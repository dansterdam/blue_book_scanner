C. THREE OTHER DIRECTORS WHO WERE ON DUTY FROM 150OZ TO 240OZ ON 24 SEPTEMBER HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED AND RECALL THE FOLLOWING: 
1. THE RADAR RETURNS BEARING TRACK NUMBER JB129 DID NOT MOVE DURING THIS PERIOD.
2. THE RADAR RETURN WAS IN A POSITION VERY CLOSE TO A GAP FILLER ANTENNA LOCATED ON A MOUNTAIN AT THE 8010 FOOT LEVEL.
3. REPEATED PASSES WERE MADE BY INTERCEPTORS AT LEVELS FROM 40,000 DOWN To 12,000, THE INTERCEPTORS BEING DIRECTED THROUGH OUR RADAR RETURN OF JB 129. NO INTERCEPTOR RECEIVED A RADAR RETURN OH HIS AIRBORNE RADAR. AT ALTITUDES BELOW 12,000 MSL VISUAL SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED UNDER VFR CONDITIONS WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS.
4. SINCE 24 SEPTEMBER 1959 SEVERAL INSTANCES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BY THESE DIRECTORS WHEREIN NON-MOVING RADAR RETURNS APPEAR IN THE SAME LOCATION AS THOSE OF JB 129. IT IS THEIR OPINION THAT UNDER CERTAIN ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS, RADAR ECHOES FROM THE GAP FILLER ANTENNA IN THAT LOCATION ARE RECEIVED. THIS PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE AND PROBABLE UNDER APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERIC CODITIONS.
5. NO SPECIFIC UFOB REPORT WAS SUBMITTED BY THIS SQUADRON,
