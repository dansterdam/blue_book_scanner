6. The interviewed officers appear to be very sincere and mature.
Each of them seem to have had enough flying hours to be amply trained in
observation and description. It is further noted that the officers, although
cooperative in discussing the incident, were rather reluctant to initiate
the report themselves. This being accredited to recent opinion both pro and
con by various individuals through popular newspapers and magazines. Each
of the three officers, when queried as to whether or not they had read or
were influenced by an article written by KEHOE which appeared in the 28
December 1949 issue of True Magazine, stated that they did not read the
article nor were they influenced by the public opinion of the article.
