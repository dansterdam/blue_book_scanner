STATEMENT

At approximately 0750 hours on the morning of October 29, 1952, a white disc-like object was observed descending behind the Erding Bowling Alley accompanied by a distinct whistling sound. The object appeared to hover approximately 15 feet above the ground for about 30 seconds, then ascend rapidly in a vertical direction. While pointing at the object, it disappeared from sight. At first glance the object appeared to be circular or disc-shaped, and was observed by two witnesses at the scene.
The object was in sight approximately 20 seconds until it disappeared from our immediate view. Behind the bowling alley and through several buildings the object became visible again for about 20 seconds. To the horizon, no sound was heard at any time from the object. The object then disappeared, giving no indication as to where it went or how it left.
The object seemed to slide or glide smoothly through the air at constant speed or velocity. It could not be observed on the object and it seemed to be formed in a mass or solid form. I could not discern the exact details of the object, but it appeared to disappear against the background of the sky.
