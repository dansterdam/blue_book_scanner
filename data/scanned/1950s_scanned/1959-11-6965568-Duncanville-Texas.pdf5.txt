It was a bright clear night. There were numerous star clusters in the sky and the moon was full. The object we observed appeared to be - Circular in shape with a bright glowing body and a dark rim around the edge. As it passed across the sky at a tremendous rate of speed, it suddenly seemed to stop and reverse its direction. It was then noiseless and gave off no trail or exhaust. After hovering for a few minutes, it suddenly took off at an extremely high rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The object was estimated to be approximately 50 ft. in diameter. We were very impressed with the manner in which this object was able to change its flight path and the high rate of speed at which it traveled.
