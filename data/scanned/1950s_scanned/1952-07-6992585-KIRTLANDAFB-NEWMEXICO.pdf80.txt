HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY
FORT SAM HOUSTON. TEXAS

1 August 1952

SUBJECT: Sight of Unidentifiable Object

TO: Commanding General
     Fourth Army
     Fort Sam Houston, Texas
     ATTN: ACoFS, G-2

The undersigned lives at 681D, Infantry Post, Fort Sam Houston,
Texas. At 2230 hours, 31 July 1952, he heard his neighbors make the
following remarks: "There it is." "There comes one," etc. Lieutenant
******* went outside to investigate the possibility of seeing a
"Flying saucer." At approximately 2235, facing southwest, he saw an
object moving across the sky at a speed less than that of a jet but
seemingly greater than that of a conventional aircraft. It had no
blinking lights on its wings and no flaming exhaust. It had some type
of motor, as a hum was heard which seemed to be a hundred yards behind
the object. Its color was red in distinction to the stars, which were
yellow. The size seemed to be that of a star and the shape appeared to
be round. It did not seem to be burning, yet the entire object cast a
reddish glow. It appeared to be flying at an altitude of between 3,000
and 6,000 feet. It disappeared after being visible for a period of
about one minute.
