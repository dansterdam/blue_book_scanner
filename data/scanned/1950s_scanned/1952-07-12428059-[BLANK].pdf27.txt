MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: He has no measurement that
you can put in scientific hands.

THE PRESS: Well, other than his eye as a pilot.

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: He says -- if the quality of
the observer is that of seeing something, he was a qualified
observer. If the quality is measuring something, he is not a
qualified observer.

THE PRESS: Well, the reason I'd implied that he'd
be qualified is he was probably concentrating with all of his
intensity upon this object that he was pursuing. He must have
been thinking about it pretty intensely; therefore, can probably
give you some pretty good information. Have you questioned him
about it?

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: Yes. He had motive; he had
direction; he had interest; he had opportunity. But he had no
measuring devices to measure this thing, or these things that
need to have measurement before it can become anything other
than a sighting.

THE PRESS: Well, do you explain his sighting on the
basis of this heat inversion theory too, now?

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: Not necessarily. That very
likely is one that sits apart and says insufficient measurement,
insufficient association with other things; insufficient insuff-
ficient association with other probabilities for it to do any
more than to join that group of sightings that we still hold
in front of us as saying no.

THE PRESS: Hasn't he admitted that that might have
been a ground light that he was looking at?

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: I don't recall that I --

THE PRESS: Well, have you come to any conclusion as
a result of interrogating this pilot?

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: None other than that this is
another one of the thousand or two thousand sightings.

THE PRESS: General, this fellow that almost flew
into the ground, did he go around a corner as if on a bent
return? What were the circumstances of that flight?
