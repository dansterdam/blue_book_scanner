STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

Examination of the material found on the ranch near Roswell, New Mexico, has revealed that the material appears to be of a type not manufactured and for which no earthly use can be determined. A preliminary examination of the material conducted on 11 July 1947 determined the follouing properties:

1. The material is paper thin, tough, flexible and glossy. It cannot be torn, cut, or pierced with any instrument. 

2. The material is not metal but has metallic properties - it is not magnetic, nor does it conduct electricity.

3. When crumpled, it immediately returns to its original shape and configuration, retaining its original properties without any permanent deformation.

4. The material is not affected by moisture, acids, or extreme temperatures. It cannot be burned by flame, heated or cooled. It retains its original shape and properties under all conditions.

5. The material exhibits a dull gray color and is apparently composed of an unknown substance.
