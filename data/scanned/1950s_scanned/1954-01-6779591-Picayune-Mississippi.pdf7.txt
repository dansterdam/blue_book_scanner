DES FLIES BENEATH THUNDERSTORM IN GREENRILLE, OHIO: DEC 26, 1954 -- CIVILIAN OBSERVATION BY MR. AND MRS. F. KROB. OBJECTS WERE SEEN AT THE NORTHWEST HORIZON, HOVERING STATIONARY AT FIRST. THEY THEN MOVED SUDDENLY AND COURSE ERRATICALLY FROM THE NORTHWEST, PASSING DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. THE OBJECTS APPEARED AS A FLIGHT OF LIGHTS, ALMOST AS IF SUSPENDED FROM A MOTHER CRAFT. IT EMITTED A BRIGHT LIGHT, ALMOST AS CLEAR AS DAYLIGHT, AND CHANGED SHAPE AND SPEED RAPIDLY, DASHED UPWARDS AND THEN SUDDENLY FROM SIGHT. IT MOVED VERY FAST ESTIMATED 1000 MPH. IT HOVERED FOR ABOUT 15 SECONDS AND THEN DASHED OUT OF SIGHT. THE OBJECTS WERE VIEWED FROM THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW AND WERE WATCHED FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES BEFORE THEY DISAPPEARED. NO NOISE WAS HEARD.

1954 - JAN. 17 THIS WRITER SIGHTED THE FLIGHT OF A BLUISH-WHITE DISC. WHILE A FEW DAYS LATER A MR. (REDACTED) AND WIFE WITNESSED A LOW FLYING DISC OF A SIMILAR COLOR OVER CINCINNATI'S GENERAL ELECTRIC PLANT. BOTH OBSERVERS ARE CONFIDENT THAT WHAT THEY SAW WERE NONE OTHER THAN FLYING SAUCERS. SINCE THERE HAS BEEN NUMEROUS SIGHTINGS IN THIS AREA RECENTLY, FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY.
