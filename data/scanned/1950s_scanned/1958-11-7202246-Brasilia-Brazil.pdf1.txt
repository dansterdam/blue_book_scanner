4. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-Visual
5. PHOTOS: None

10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Unidentified object thought to be a celestial object observed by 500 people. AF plane went up to 3,000 meters and object was estimated to be at 12,000 meters. No other information.
11. COMMENTS: Object observed by many people. AF plane went up & saw object. Came back & could add no additional information other than that the object was noted at an estimated altitude near 35,000 feet. Probably a balloon but data is not sufficient to support this conclusion. Description not reported but object must have been in the sky for analysis.
