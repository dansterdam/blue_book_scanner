The text describes the observation of an unidentified object by the witness, who was on a tour of duty at Brookley Air Force Base in Alabama. The object was observed through binoculars and appeared to be larger than a planet or bright star, and remained stationary for approximately 20 minutes before the witness advised the tower operators to continue observation. The document also mentions that the object had a small distinct white tip on the ground return at a distance of four (4) miles on a bearing of 230 degrees from Brookley while I was observing the object.

STATE!ENT OF 
CAPTAIN WILLIAM H. EDWARDS 
NO 53? 75
29 August 1952
The undersigned was on a tour of duty as Officer of the Day, Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama, from 0530, 28 August 1952 to 0530, 29 August 1952.
As approximately 2130, 28 August 1952, I received a telephone call from a Mr. ___ living in Chickasaw, Alabama. I alerted the Air Provost Marshal and the control tower operators, who in turn alerted the G.C.A. operators at Brookley Air Force Base.
I then proceeded to the tower to see if I could observe any objects in the area advised by Mr. ___ arriving in the tower at approximately 2150.
I was advised while in the tower that the G.C.A. agents were alerted to check the accuracy of the report.
The tower operator asked me to check an object he had observed with the binoculars in the tower. This time was approximately 2150. Looking with both the naked eye and through the glasses, the object appeared slightly larger than a planet or a bright star. This was approximately 20°above the horizon and at a distance of approximately 10° to 20° from the ground. This object remained stationary for approximately 20 minutes. I was called out and advised the tower operators to continue observation.
The G.C.A. advised the tower that they had a small distinct white blip in edge of the ground return at a distance of four (4) miles on a bearing of 230 degrees from Brookley while I was observing the object. This white blip was approximately the same relative bearing and distance as estimated by the undersigned.
