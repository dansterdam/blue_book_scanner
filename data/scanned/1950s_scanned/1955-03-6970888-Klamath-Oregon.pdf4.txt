RADAR-TRACKED SIGHTING
7. DETAILS ON AIR INTELLIGENCE

A radar object was observed by the Air Defense System whose characteristics approximately met the standard Rube Goldberg Military specification. The object was discovered at approximately 15,000 feet altitude moving south at approximately 9,500 miles per hour. Two radar units observed the object over a 20 minute period, and noted that the object made several directional changes and deflections. At one point, it changed course from 120 degrees to 180 degrees without a noticeable reduction in speed.

The object was tracked until it disappeared from the radar screen at a distance of 100 nautical miles from the observer. The observer noted that the object had violated no protocols and did not appear hostile.

8. Disposition:
The radar record and the observer's report attached to this document have been forwarded for analysis.

7. (a) The specific nature and characteristics of the object have yet to be determined. No further sighting reports have been received from this area.
