More than once Mr. took UFOD investigators out into the field and described the sightings of the unidentified flying objects pointing out land marks, etc. He is thoroughly familiar with the physical characteristics observed during the sightings. He state: "This thing was almost round with a dome on it! I've never seen anything like it."

Investigation revealed from a Coll. Rural in the area that two ball-bearing doughnut-shaped objects were seen to emerge from clouds over there, were out after dark some night after August 22, 1955 and that they might have caused the other sightings. However, the Shoenman's were positive (1) that the event happened in late July or early August because that is the precise time they were moving into their new home and (2) that this was absolutely no balloonor dirigible of any kind that they saw going overhead.

"The Lake Shore Book," a volume containing the investigated backgrounds of all the businessman in Lake County, had this to say (in part) about the Shoenman's:

"Technical experience, truly international in character, lies behind "the physical psychology" in television field which has achieved in Lake County. After making an outstanding record in the bridge, iron and oil industries in North America, South America, Africa and Asia, in which he has specialized, his company, new known as the best in the country, he was born in Springfield, Illinois on April 22, 1916."
