The text in the document is as follows:

The lights in the cockpit were turned low and he noticed the lights off the left wing go normal as the ship continued on its course. He then turned the cockpit lights off while he continued to observe the sighting. His description of the lights was that they varied from a yellow to a light orange and each individual light was the approximate size of a quarter held at arm's length. The lights appeared to be in trail, echelon upward, at an angle of approximately thirty degrees with a distance between each individual light of about the space of ten (10) quarters held at arm's length. The number two light appeared to hold its position throughout the period of the sighting. The number three light was quite erratic and would drop back, then fluidite and then will back into position. This occurred approximately ten times during the period of the sighting. Captain indicated at times the number three light appeared to be dancing.
