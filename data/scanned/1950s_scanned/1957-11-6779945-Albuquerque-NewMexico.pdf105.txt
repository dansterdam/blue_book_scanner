INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS:
The subject impressed the investigator as being completely sincere and telling the absolute truth about the incident. He gave the impression of a man who had seen something which astounded and amazed him to the extent that he seemed reticent about it and telling about it. He stated that when he first observed the object, he thought it was a weather balloon, but as time went on and he continued to observe it, he realized it was not a weather balloon. He said it was round and saucer-shaped, larger than any weather balloon, and completely silent in its flight, and hovered at times. He was about 1 1/2 miles from the object when he first saw it, and it was about 500 feet in the air. 

He said, when he was interviewed, that was all he knew and saw.
