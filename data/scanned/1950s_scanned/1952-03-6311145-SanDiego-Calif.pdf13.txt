The text in the document is as follows:

DIO 11 HD                 Serial 67-52      dated 10 April 1952
Subj: Unconventional airborne objects, sighting of

ON COMMENTS:
Although it is believed that the source reported factual data of this sighting as no radar contacts were obtained, the report does not indicate that physically maneuverable jet aircraft were involved. This would parallel the comments made by the Project Blue Book Officer, although his estimate of location, speed and distance of an airborne object, particularly in understandable, are very subjective based solely on visual perception. Also, it is known that a jet aircraft with afterburner is a brilliant-white exhaust, elongated to the time of the sighting. It is suggested that the appearance of a brilliant white, elongated object could account for the area at the time of the sighting. Report will be forwarded to the Air Technical Intelligence Center for appropriate action and incorporation into the study maintained on unidentified flying objects.
