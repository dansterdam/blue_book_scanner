Supplemental Report

Subject: Small Flying Tornado-like Craft. 
Date of Occurrence: October 4th, 1953.

On Sunday evening, October 4th, 1953, at the large house spotted another of these small craft. There also was one directly overhead of our house at the same time.

Each of them explored the exterior of these dark houses from top to bottom. This general exhibition was all from darkness until past midnight, when it finally gave up watchin: for to look. How much observation I cannot say; or what it was looking for remained these houses flying slowly around and from top to bottom, sometimes stopping for several or more seconds to examine something in detail.

I can assure you they were not light reflections from the water, the bay, or street lights. The next day I took these matters up with the chief of police in my car in order to get his opinion, and he assures me that as the object had no noise whatsoever, could be no flight controlled by any known engine, and in no effects whatsoever on the exhibition. 

It would seem that these small craft are controlled remotely. Their motions are not erratic, but rather bouncy and jerky in movement. While they are in motion, rather like a rubber ball going one way and then circling around, as if they were examining something while down go.
