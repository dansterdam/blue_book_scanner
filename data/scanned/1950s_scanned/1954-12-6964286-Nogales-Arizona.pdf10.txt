Text from the document:

UNCLASSIFIED

SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

REPORTING AGENCY: 362ND AIR DIVISION (DEFENSE)

REFERENCE: AFMDC 1 report dated December 3, 1954, concerning a reported break-off of the chase because of low fuel status (K)-PRIORITY WAS GIVEN TO LANDING RATHER THAN CONTINUING PURSUIT OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT. DEPARTURE OF OBJECT WAS ACCOMPLISHED AT 24/0600Z.

ALL THAT WAS EVER LEARNED ABOUT THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT WAS THAT IT WAS OVAL IN SHAPE AND GREEN FLASHES WITH A STRONGER RED FLASH ACCORDING TO PILOT OBSERVATION.

THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT SEEMED TO REMAIN 3.50 TO 4.0 NAUTICAL MILES ABOVE WHILE BEING PURSUED THROUGHOUT THE INCIDENT.

LT COL P. SULLIVAN, AF S/N 12367, PILOT ATC CO 32AARRW, CALLED THE OBJECT UNTIL HIS GASOLINE WAS NEARLY EXHAUSTED AND HE WAS FORCED TO BREAK OFF PURSUIT.

AS REQUESTED, F-86 AIRCRAFT S/N 51-2905 (PILOTED BY KENNETH G. HITE) WAS SCRAMBLED TO INTERCEPT THE OBJECT, BUT WAS UNABLE TO VISUALLY REACQUIRE IT.

SLACK BETWEEN OBSERVATION AND DISCLOSURE ON 12 DECEMBER WAS DUE TO CONFIRMATION OF INCIDENT THROUGH LENGTHY INVESTIGATION.

ACCORDING TO INFORMATION RECEIVED, BOTH F-86 AND OBJECT WERE VISIBLE FROM THE GROUND, CONFIRMING THE OBSERVATION FROM THE AIR.

F-86 WAS PICKED UP ON RADAR SCOPE, BUT IT WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN VISUAL CONTACT.

WHEN REQUESTED, F-86 WAS UNABLE TO CLOSE IN ON THE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT AND RADAR CONTACT WAS LOST.

AT ONE TIME DURING THE INCIDENT, I HAD ONE OR TWO 105 STRIKES OR JAMS ON MY INSTRUMENTS, INDICATING SOME FORM OF ELECTRONIC INTERFERENCE WITH THE AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS.

ON 12/13, NO OTHER IDENTICAL INTELLIGENCE WAS RECEIVED BECAUSE AT THAT TIME THE INCIDENT DID NOT SEEM TO WARRANT FURTHER ACTION.

FOR POSSIBLE UAVY TRAFFIC IN THE LOCAL AREA, I RECEIVED A NEGATIVE ANSWER.

INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED VIA TELEPHONE AT 30/2232Z.

THERE WERE NO OUTBOUND FLIGHTS FROM 24/0000Z TO 24/0700Z.
