Malibu Beach, California
A newspaper reporter called March 1953 intelligence officer and reported that a U.S. Coast Guard plane with approximately 5,000 hours flying time was flying in a twin-engine beach craft near Malibu Beach at 9,000+ altitude on a 3 course when he observed it by radar. The plane was estimated to be 35 size flying in a vertical plane at approximately 20,000*. Speed estimate was 12,000 mph on a 3 minute course. The object disappeared in the direction of Riverside, California.

ATIC Comments and Conclusion
Although the pilot was considered to be reliable, there was enough information available to this headquarters for proper analysis. Therefore, our conclusion is insufficient data for evaluation.
