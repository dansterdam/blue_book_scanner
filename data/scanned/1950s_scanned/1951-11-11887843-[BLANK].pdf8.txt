(1) No further fiscal expenditure be made in pursuing the problem. This opinion is prompted partly by the fruitless expenditure during the past year, the uncertainty of existence of unexplainable aerial objects, and by the inaccurate position currently taken by Holloman AFB as indicated by the "stand-by status" of the project. The arrangements by AADS for continued vigilance by Land-Air, the weather station as well as the briefing of pilots on the problem in past relative to the need for a systematic instrumentation program.
(2) Within the next few months, DR. Whipple will have completed the installation of two 35-mm kinestic cameras for meteor studies. The cameras will be stationed about 20 miles apart in the vicinity of Las Cruces, New Mexico. Since these studies will be sponsored by the CAU, arrangements can be made for obtaining the film for evidence of aerial object phenomena.
