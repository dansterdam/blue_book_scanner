The document describes the investigation of the incident, noting that the weather conditions and descriptions were similar to a previous sighting on October 10th, and that the conclusion was that Lt. Flues did not pursue the matter further.

Here is the text content of the document:

Travel Report - Lt A. C. Flues
Mitchell AFB - 12 Dec 52

Lt Flues contacted Maj Geyer in Base Operations at Mitchell AFB. Major Geyer referred Lt Flues to Capt Dyste also of Base Operations who handled the investigation of the flyobprpt of 1 Dec 52. Capt Dyste had completed and forwarded through channels an AF Form 112, concerning this incident. Through the use of a statement of each observer and a navigator's star chart, Capt Dyste had positively identified the object as the planet Jupiter. Weather conditions and descriptions were strikingly similar to those of the Presque Isle sighting of 10 Oct. The followup 112 which should reach ATIC shortly was so complete in its details and the conclusion was so obvious and logical that Lt Flues did not pursue the matter further.
