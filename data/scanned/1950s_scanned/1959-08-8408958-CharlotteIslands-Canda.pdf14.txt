The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, specifically a memo dated 29 Sep 59 regarding an Unidentified Flying Object.

Memo, AFCIN-4e5g, 29 Sep 59, (U) Unidentified Flying Object
1st Ind (AFCIN-4e5a/Ur. Pickeisimer/74201/JC) 21 Oct 59

1. Analysis of attached radarscope film has been accomplished with the following results:
a. The blips on the film are not different from ordinary radar blips, hence no particular type of "target" or flying object is indicated.
b. A few still photographs of a radar indicator do not give the viewer as good an insight as to what actually occurred as the live radar picture gives to the radar operator at the time of the sighting of the object.

2. This office agrees with the proposed explanation that some type of aircraft possibly caused the radar return.
