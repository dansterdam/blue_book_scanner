The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document with handwritten text describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting that occurred in Marshfield, Missouri.

OBJECT FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. AFTER THE TWO OF US STOPPED THE AREA VERY THOROUGHLY WE RETURNED TO MARSHFIELD, MISSOURI. I CALLED THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND ALSO CALLED CAPT. G. E. HARTMAN ABOUT THE OBJECT. HE SAID FOUR MEN TO MARSHFIELD, MISSOURI WHERE THEY PICKED THE TWO OF US UP AND WE RETURNED TO THE AREA AND MADE A MORE THOROUGH SEARCH AND OF A MUCH WIDER AREA BUT WITHOUT FINDING ANY MORE TRACE OF THIS OBJECT THAT WE HAD FOUND BEFORE. IT ABOUT 9.30 P.M. TWO U.P. RAILROAD DETECTIVES ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND AFTER EXAMINING THE AREA AND MAKING A SEARCH OF THEIR OWN, ALSO FAILED TO FIND ANYTHING AT ALL OTHER THAN THE TWO PLACES IN THE EARTH THAT WAS TORN UP. AFTER LEAVING THE TRUCK IN THE BEGINNING TO START THE FIRST SEARCH, MR. ISH AND MYSELF DID NOT SEE THE SILVER OBJECT AGAIN THAT FIRST ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION. THE TWO OF US HAD TIME TO STUDY THE OBJECT AND IT IS JUST AS I HAVE DESCRIBED.
