The object was observed visually by Major Marvin. Executive Officer of the Battalion, and Platoon Sgt. of Btry B 509th AAA Bn (Gun) (90mm).

During the time of observation the weather was fairly clear and winds were approximately 10 miles per hour in velocity, coming in westerly direction.

During the time of observation there were no meteorological or other conditions which might have accounted for the object.
