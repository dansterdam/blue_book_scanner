Comment re sighting No. 1:
Date: 12 July 1958 
Hours: 2120 to 2155 local
Place: Area near Greenbay, Wisc.
Object: "Sputnik III rocket" was over Lake Huron at 135 miles altitude.
Using general observation point of 45 degrees N - 90 degrees West the rocket portion of Sputnik III followed the rocket's portion to the West or the rocket's orbit but still pretty much in the visibility range until last 15 minutes or so (visible at 75 degrees - 80 degrees 4) upper half of lower Michigan. Although the direction of motion is consistent with that of Sputnik III, neither complete stage seems to have been sufficiently lighted off the eastern horizon to be seen in the area described.
