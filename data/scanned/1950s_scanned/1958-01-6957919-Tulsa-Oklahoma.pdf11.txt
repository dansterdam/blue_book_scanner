THE OBJECT WAS SIGHTED ON JANUARY 6, 1958 BY MR. AND MRS. JOHN L. TEEPLE DRIVING SOUTH ON U.S. HIGHWAY 66 APPRCXIÂ¬ MATELY 3 MILES NORTH OF TULSA, OKLAHOMA. THEY STOPPED THEIR CAR AND EXAMINED THE OBJECT WHICH LOOKED LIKE A ROCK. IT WAS FOUND BY MR. TEEPLE TO BE ABOUT 6 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND WEIGHED APPROXIMATELY 2 LBS.
THE OBJECT WAS OF AN IRREGULAR SHAPE AND APPEARED SCORCHED OR CHARRED ON THE SURFACE. THERE WERE NO VISIBLE MARKINGS OR DISTINGUISHING FEATURES ON THE OBJECT.
MR. TEEPLE BROUGHT THE OBJECT TO THE TULSA POLICE DEPARTMENT WHO IN TURN DELIVERED IT TO LT. COL. J.L. JORDAN OF THE 4676TH AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE DETACHMENT (ATIC) FOR EXAMINATION.
THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOST LIKELY A METEORITE OR SOME OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENA RATHER THAN A MAN-MADE OBJECT.
