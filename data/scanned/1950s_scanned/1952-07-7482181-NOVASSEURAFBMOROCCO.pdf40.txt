Dear Tom:

Regarding the notification made by you on your publication. I have thoroughly checked the case file and I cannot agree to the changes you have indicated. My only reason for not agreeing to the changes is that the situation as I see it is that the cause of the sighting may really lie in a singular and probably mundane case. My request to point out a number of things about the modifications.

1. The word "sequence" is the exact word used by in his hand written statement.

2. "Sequence" is one thing, "irregular order" is another and they don't have the same meaning.

3. The case file states that the object was estimated to be 100 feet by using a pencil.

4. I can find no place in the record where it states that other persons observed the objects. 

That's all I can say in the record. I can find no evidence that would indicate that the weather visibility is stated in your article is the weather one that would have a sufficient probability to cause any interference that would give the apparent magnitude that others have mentioned.  

I'm sorry that I can't agree to your proposal now, but I have to be fair to the people who have had previous access to the case file.

Sincerely,

HECTOR QUINTANILLA, Jr., Major, USAF
Chief, Project Blue Book
