The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line with a point marked "A" on it, and another point marked "B" on the same curved line. The second sketch shows a larger view, with a person standing on a road and a mountain range in the background. A smaller inset sketch shows a curved horizon line with a point marked "A".

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place on "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
