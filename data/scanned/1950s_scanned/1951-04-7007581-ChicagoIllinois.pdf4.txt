Gentlemen:

I wish to report that on Thursday, April 26th at about 5:25 P.M. I sighted another of the mystery air planes on the lake front at cement road.

It was a bright silver colored affair with little wings and bearing from the center. The cone spread was very short and the ship was practically at a standstill at 1000 pm. altitude for about 30 seconds. It then moved so swiftly until out of sight as far as I was concerned. I was driving south on Shore and 33rd St. at the time.

Yours very truly,
