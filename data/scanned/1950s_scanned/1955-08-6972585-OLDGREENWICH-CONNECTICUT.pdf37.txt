The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a letter from the American Astronomical Society regarding a request for more details on a "remarkable photograph" related to upper atmosphere phenomena.

The text of the letter is as follows:

American Astronomical Society
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
July 19, 1956

Mr. ...

Shore Lands
Old Greenwich, Connecticut

Dear Mr. Donehue:

Captain Gregory of the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base has called my attention to a sighting of an upper atmosphere phenomena, to a remarkable photograph which you apparently took on August 1, 1955. I understand that you were unable to obtain a few more details on this. It now happens that I do not know how far this is from your home and perhaps we could arrange to meet, without too much difficulty.

I understand that you are, or were, a student at the Ohio State University. Our paths may have already crossed since I am a professor of Astronomy at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

As regards the Artificial Satellite Project, I would be glad to give you some information about it, if you like. What I would like to know is whether you could arrange to see me on that day, as I would like to get away a few points about your photograph that are not quite clear to me. Would you be kind enough to let me know whether such a meeting might be possible?

Sincerely yours,
J. Allen Hynek
Astronomer
