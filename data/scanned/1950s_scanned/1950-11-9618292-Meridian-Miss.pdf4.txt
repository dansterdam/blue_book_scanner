BAPS Intelligence Report, DO No. 28 Nov 56, Subject: Report of Unconventional Aircraft

In Meridian, Miss., a citizen of the Mississippi Air National Guard said he chased an unidentified object for 55 miles at 300 miles an hour but never got near it. He said it did not have a vapor trail and that it was flying very erratic with a bright flickered flame.

Two mechanics at Keesler Field, in Meridian, watched the flight with binoculars and said it could have been a V-2.

Mrs. J. L. Bentley, who resides between Jackson and Clinton, said she and other members of her family saw the object about 4:45 p.m. They said it was flying at a very high altitude and traveling very fast directly west.

She added that she could not see the front of the object but the rear end looked like a cylinder of flame about 50 or 60 feet long.

Mrs. J. L. Bentley said she called the observation tower at the Jackson Air Base who confirmed her report of seeing the strange object, but officials there would not attempt to identify it.

ACTION: None contemplated by this Headquarters.
