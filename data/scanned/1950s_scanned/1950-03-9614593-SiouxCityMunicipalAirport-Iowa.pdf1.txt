11. BRIEF SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS
Flight while a T-6 A/C flight was above and below this. This was below 1000 ft. to be about Â½ the size of the A/C. The object moved rapidly. Shaped like a small parachute. No noise. Object traveling northwest. Collision with A/C during this trip. Course headed my way. Weather was hazy. This may be an illusion as not reported. Disappearance was rapid after the collision. Possible that debris from the A/C was the cause of this sighting.
