Case 195, Los Angeles, Cal., Aug. 21, 1956--A letter from Vivian Marsh relates: "My father saw a ball of five traveling across the sky at about 8:15 p.m. in a straight horizontal course. At first it looked like five, then it looked like one and in 20 minutes, having seen nothing we went to bed. Five minutes later we saw a fireball and rushing outside we were in time to see it disappear over the western horizon. It was traveling in a wavy motion, occasionally stopping. It was heading north one moment, and the next it was heading south. It accelerated more going south and went over a plane that was coming in. It passed the plane, changed its direction both ways and the plane vanished. I noticed that a much smaller ball of fire followed the plane, and two others were underneath or on the side of the plane."

Ed: The L.A. Times reported "other flying stuff" for the same sighting as follows: "Another observer stated that he saw an unidentified object in the shape of a football that hovered over the San Fernando Valley. The object was apparently elongated shape, which appeared to be bathed in the glare of something and to be going up and down like an elevator. In the opinion of the observer, the object was not an aircraft, but was a "missile" seen cruising across the San Fernando Valley skies. Of course, to the writer it was what Vivian Marsh saw: the wavy motion, the accelerations, the disappearance into the horizon rather than a crash."
