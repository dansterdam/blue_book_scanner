CHAPTER V
HARVARD ANNOUNCEMENT CARDS

Announcement Card 1390
Satellite 1958α: On February 1, 1958, The U.S.A. National Committee for the International Geophysical Year has announced that an instrumented satellite was launched in orbit on February 1, 1958 at 10:48:05 U.T. at a point approximately 23°.34 N and 73°.61 W. The rocket was launched at Cape Canaveral, Florida at 2:55:30 E.S.T. from Cape Canaveral.

Including the empty rocket casing of the last stage, the satellite's overall length is about 80 inches and a diameter of 6 inches. It contains a radio transmitter with a power level of 50 milliwatts and telemetry of data by both transmitters. The satellite's visual magnitude is white and may be visible with binoculars under optimum conditions. Scientific experiments include cosmic ray observations, meteoritic impact, and temperature measurements.
