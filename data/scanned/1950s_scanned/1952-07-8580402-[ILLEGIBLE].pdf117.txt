Answer to 1942-0:
These questions cannot be answered in terms of the classical physics. Because of the complete strangeness of the subject, I cannot estimate their distance and size in appearance, and there is no apparent speed also deducible in distance. Assuming they were of 10,000, they would have been about the size of a small flame each, and again assuming that altitude, they would have been traveling at 2000 - 3000 miles to have crossed the arc of the sky in 5 seconds. This time is short, but in my excellent position for observation. There are certainly no known or conventional meteorological phenomena.
