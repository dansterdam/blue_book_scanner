The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report, with text and instructions about reporting on sightings of unidentified flying objects.

Text from the document:

If practicable, attach to this page the sketches of a local area chart which show the location where the sighting occurred, the azimuth and flight path of the object.

If a local area chart is not available, roughly sketch in the area of the sighting showing latitude and longitude. Then plot the flight path of the object by showing its azimuth and the flight path of the object. But in prominent handmarks as necessary.
