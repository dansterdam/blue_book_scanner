This image does not contain a photograph, it appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. As an OCR system, I will now transcribe the text found in the document:

Dear *****,

This letter is in response to your report of an unidentified flying object sighting in ***********, Indiana on 12 October. According to your report, this object was sighted on 12 October between 7:30 PM and 8:00 PM. The object was described as round, silently moving, and disappearing over the horizon. 

After reviewing your report, I have determined that this sighting does not represent physical evidence of an extraterrestrial craft. The object you observed was likely a conventional aircraft or atmospheric phenomena. No further investigation is warranted. 

If you have any additional questions or information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
*****
