DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO.
SUBJECT: Request - Analysis and Comments, Electronic UFO Reports
TO: AFCIN-3EL1 FROM: AFCIN-3EL1 DATE: 13 Apr 1956 COMMENT NO. 1

1. Attached are eleven (11) official UFO reports received from various Air Force radar units for your review and analysis.

2. It will be appreciated if you can only a limited summary which this division has found as follows:

a. Nearly all reports contain data which, in our opinion, is of little scientific or technical value. The majority of reports consist of sighting of lights or objects in the sky which this division has found are common occurrences and pose no threat to the security of the United States.

b. It would appear that radar UFO reports have increased in volume during the past few months. However, this trend will continue in the future, as in the past, if normal operations are maintained by Air Force radar units.

3. This division is of the opinion that your office may consider obtaining the services of either a psychological or a technical consultant to assist you in the analysis and evaluation of these reports. Reference is made to your letter dated 13 Jan 56, copy attached.
