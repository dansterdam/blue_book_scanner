The text handwritten on the form states:
"I happened to be looking out of the bay window at the northern horizon where I have a good view of the northern sky. At that moment at approximately 7:05 PM CST, I saw a small spherical object moving at a high rate of speed across the northern horizon. It was definitely round and white in color. It was going at a terrific speed & disappeared into the distance relatively near the horizon. It was in view at most 15-20 seconds. I definitely could not have been merely a satellite or plane. The motion was very erratic & swerved back & forth in the sky. At first I thought it might be a weather balloon or meteorite, but discounted these because the motion was too erratic to be either."
