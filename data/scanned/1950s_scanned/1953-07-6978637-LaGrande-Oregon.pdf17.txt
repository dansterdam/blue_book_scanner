a. Certain
b. Fairly certain
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you would construct the object that you saw - or what you think material would you use? How large would it be, what shape and color, and the details that struck you most in this sighting.
