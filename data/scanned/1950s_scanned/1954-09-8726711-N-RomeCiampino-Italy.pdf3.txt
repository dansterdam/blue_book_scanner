Netherlands - 4 Aug 54
Ten fireman observed two "flying saucers" over the Hague on the night of 4 August between 2200 and 2300 hours. They moved at incredible speed, at times remaining motionless for as long as 30 seconds. They were flat, from 10 to 15 meters in diameter, with a whitish gray light. ATIC EVAL: Possible searchlight beams.

Note: During the summer and fall months of 1954, there has been a marked increase in UFO sightings throughout Europe. ATIC attributes the majority of these sightings to two basic reasons:
1. The European press has been quick to publish, in detail, UFO sightings which has resulted in influencing a great number of persons for nighttime sightings.
2. Mr. D. Keyhoe's book was recently translated into various foreign languages and went on sale to newsstand throughout Europe during the summer of 1954.
