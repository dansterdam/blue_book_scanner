24 March 1959

Dear Mr. [redacted],

Your letter of 5 March concerning unidentified flying objects, addressed to Professor J. A. Hynek, has been referred to this office for reply. 

The theories advanced in your letter are most interesting. However, the data accumulated to date do not substantiate the existence of any phenomena that could be interpreted as evidence of the existence of the UFO phenomena in the United States. If, in your opinion, your sighting of 19 July 1954 proved to the contrary, we would be most interested in the facts surrounding this sighting.

Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Public Information Division
Office of Information Services

Mr. [redacted]
Brooklyn 19, New York
