Sir:

The enclosed matter is being forwarded to you as requested for your information. On 3/5/58 various sightings of airborne objects were observed from the Arcna area on south around Logan,Ohio. This same matter was telephoned to the Dayton Air Force base on 3/6/58.

About 100 yards south of Logan, Ohio, I observed the enclosed matter floating above 6,500 feet. The object was round and seemed to be a silvery white in color. Its elevation would be a bit over 5 statute miles up. Our records show that we first observed these objects at 19:34 PG-5-58.

This unit was assigned the complaint and arrived at the scene at 19:01 EDST. Only people contacted outside the department were the Weather Bureau and the control tower at Across-Dayton Airport.

Respectfully yours,

7th J.P.Gillanders CSP
State Highway Patrol.
