24 April 1961

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is in reply to your recent letter concerning an observation you described which occurred August 18, 1959.  

The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center furnishes the following explanation following a study of the situation reported by you:

ATIC states that the information furnished was very limited; however, the Center agrees with the conclusion offered by MASA that the object observed was probably a bolide. Bolides are bright objects seen in the sky which are extremely bright enough to observe two bolides.  

It is ATIC's opinion that the meteor observed by the witness was oversize. The light source that was reportedly observed was probably brightness enough to give an effect similar to a bolide as reported. As a result of the 75Â° angle, the true velocity of the meteor as calculated for the elliptical path was approximately 4 to 5 times that of the 25 to 30 seconds (as miles) and the true velocity normal to the elliptic of 10.45 km (6.5 miles) per second. This gives the overall relative velocity of the meteor which was 19.95 km (9.33 miles) per second. Unless the meteor entered the atmosphere parallel to the tangent at the witness' location, the observer would have seen a firmer duration than reported by the witness.

It is concluded that the meteor thus viewed was moving at a much slower velocity than that reported by the witness.

Since there was no report of the duration of this sighting, it was estimated that the object of observation probably only lasted for 9011 m (5,650 miles) at an extreme velocity of 8 km (5 miles) per second. This means the observation would have taken 18.3 minutes to complete this flight (Canadian Royal Astronomical Society, Volume Seven, Page 163). Slow acceleration to the terminal velocity would have extended that time.
