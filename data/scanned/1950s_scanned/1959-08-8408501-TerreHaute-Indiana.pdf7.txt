1. References:
a. Letter to Mr. from NASA, dated 9 March 1961 explaining the possible cause of an unidentified flying object on 19 August 1959.
b. Letter to Science, AAAS from Mr. dated 14 March 1961 outlining general information concerning his sighting of an unidentified flying object on 19 August 1959.
c. Letter to Mr. from Science AAAS, dated 22 March 1961 suggesting that Mr. report his sighting to the United States Air Force.

2. The information concerning Mr. sighting, reference b, is very limited. however, AAAS advised that the conclusion of 19 August 1959 was probably that of a bolide. Besides these very brief meteors which are seen or heard to explode.

3. Very little data was provided concerning Mr. sighting, and that which is provided is very technical in nature. The witness is of the opinion that the object was approximately 750 to the plane of the elliptic. This angle would be necessary to give the observed 22 to 24 sec as reported by Mr. As a result of the 75° angle the true velocity of the meteor (in miles) per second, and the true velocity normal to the elliptic was 13.75 m (5.7 miles) per second. The angular velocity of the object observed was 2.7° (4.7 miles) per second. Furthermore, based on the reported direction and estimated path time, the relative velocity of the meteor was 14.95 Km (9.33 miles) per second. While the witnesses location the apparent velocity would be further reduced by the cosine of the angle between the tangent line and the meteor's real path. It is concluded that the meteor moved at a much slower velocity than that computed for the relative velocity.

4. Action message did not report the duration of his experience, but long duration of lights have been recorded. The longest recorded flight in that of a meteor which lasted for 90.1 (59.9 miles) at an average velocity of 10.m (5 miles) per second. This meteor would have taken 13.8 minutes to complete this flight (Journal Royal Astronomical Society).
