1. There seems to be two or more possible explanations of the unidentified target reported by attached Form 112:
a. Radar target was caused by an actual airborne target.
b. Interference from a purposely "locked-on" jamming or confusion transmitter.
c. Other less likely causes such as equipment fault, weather, etc.

2. Since the path of the radar target was along a straight line passing thru the radar station location, it is considered more likely that the explanation given in paragraph 1b is applicable.
