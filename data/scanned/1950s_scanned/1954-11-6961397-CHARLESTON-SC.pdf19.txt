The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. The text describes what appears to be an observation of some unidentified flying objects, referring to them as a "so-called Saucer" and describing their appearance as "two saucer-shaped objects" that were "looking at the two-disc shaped objects" and "at a considerable distance from the axis of flight".

Gentleman - These were started by so-called "Flying Saucer" picture. Really, they seemed much closer to me than notes would indicate.
At the two saucers are looking at the two disc shaped objects - as looking to the right and at a considerable distance from the axis of flight. 
Thank you very much.
