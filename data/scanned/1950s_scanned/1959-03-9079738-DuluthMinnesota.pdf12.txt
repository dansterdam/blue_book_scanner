III. SUBJECT'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: On 14 March 1959, at 0212 hours, 1st Lt. Owen L. Schwatka was airborne on a routine training mission in the vicinity of DULUTH, Minnesota. He was flying at an altitude of 5,000 feet when he observed two (2) lights to the north. These lights appeared to be about 10 miles distant and at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. The lights appeared to be rotating and changing colors, going from red to green to blue and then white. This cycle was repeated several times. The lights remained stationary for about 1 to 2 minutes and then accelerated and climbed at a 45 degree angle, reaching a speed which SCHWATKA estimated to be 1,000 to 1,500 mph. At the point of maximum speed, the lights appeared to be about the size of a dime and then simply disappeared from sight. The entire sighting lasted approximately 3 to 4 minutes.
SCHWATKA states that he is certain that the lights were not aircraft, satellites, astronomic bodies, or any other known object. He states that the lights were intelligently controlled and were capable of maneuvers and speeds far in excess of any known aircraft. SCHWATKA further states that he has discussed this sighting with other pilots and officers at the base and that they are of the opinion that the sighting was of an unidentified flying object.
