No- Case (Information Only)
September 1956
Severill, Idaho

And another Texas paper, the Fort Worth Sunday News, in September, 1956 by Officer William Van Dyke of the Idaho State Police, at Severill, Idaho (on the Utah border). It shows two distinct disc-shaped objects, according to reports, they were taken over a spot where an automobile accident had taken place at the same time. The victims of the accident told State Police that they had encountered the peculiar white substance, and an investigation was supposed to have been made. (We are checking this and hope to report more fully later.)
