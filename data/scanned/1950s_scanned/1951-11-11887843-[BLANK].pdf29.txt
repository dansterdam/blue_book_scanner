The image contains an UNCLASSIFIED document with text describing the findings of the Geophysics Research Division regarding peculiar light phenomena observed in the southwestern United States. The document states that the observations covered a little over a year, and most of the observed phenomena can be attributed to man-made objects such as airplanes, balloons, and rockets. It also mentions observations of flying birds, small clouds, and meteorites, but indicates that even the somewhat strange observations often called "Green Fireballs" are natural phenomena. The document concludes by recommending that no more funds be invested in this research and that a sharp eye be kept on anything unusual along this line.

There does not appear to be any photograph included in this particular document.

ABSTRACT:
Early in 1950 the Geophysics Research Division received a directive to investigate peculiar light phenomena that had been observed in the skies of the southwestern United States. Project "Twinkle" was established to check into these phenomena and their explanation.
The gist of the findings is essentially negative. The period of observations covers a little over a year. Some unusual phenomena were observed during that period, most of them can be attributed to such man-made objects as airplanes, balloons, rockets, etc. Others can be attributed to natural phenomena such as flying birds, small clouds, and meteorites. There has been no indication that even the somewhat strange observations often called "Green Fireballs" are anything but natural phenomena.
Our recommendations are in essence that there is no use in sinking any more funds into this at the present time and that we will keep in connection with one of our meteor studies a sharp eye on anything unusual along this line.
