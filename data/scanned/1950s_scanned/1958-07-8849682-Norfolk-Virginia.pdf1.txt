The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report document, likely from 1958. The text on the image has been transcribed as follows:

Wanted: Any and all information on UFOs, such as pictures, magazine and newspaper articles, and UFO publications. Especially want the following: FLYING SAUCERS ARE REAL, Keyhoe; MYSTERIES OF OTHER WORLDS REVEALED, Ley and Keyhoe; THE SAUCERIAN REVIEW, 1956, Baker; FLYING SAUCER REVIEW'S WORLD ROUNDUP; AIR FORCE PROJECT BLUE BOOKS SPECIAL REPORT NO. 14, Davidson; THE BOOKS OF CHARLES FORT, Fort; THE WHITE SANDS INCIDENT, FRY; IS ANOTHER WORLD WATCHING?, Heard. I will buy these, but prefer to borrow or rent them.

I would like to have a discussion with others near my age (16) who are interested in UFOs, especially those in Virginia. I have several pocketbook editions of science fiction that I will sell (or trade for the above books).
