November 22, 1958

Commanding Officer,
Wright Air Force Base,
Ohio, U.S.A.

Dear Sir:

I am writing to report an observation of an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of Ras Tanura on November 20, 1958. I was with a group of people on a house lawn located directly on the beach of the Persian Gulf. One of the people in our party called attention to a bright light in the sky. This light was much brighter than any falling star and was travelling absolutely horizontal with the horizon. With the naked eye we could not determine what it was or its distance away, but we could see that it was more than several thousand feet in altitude. It was travelling at a speed that was less than any aircraft we had ever seen. The light or glow turned greenish in color and finally extinguished. When it was directly across from us it appeared as an extremely bright ball of light with a short tail. No sound was heard.

All present agreed on what had been seen but no one came forth with any good suggestion as to what we had just seen.

For reference purposes I am a senior construction engineer with the Arabian American Oil Co. Those with me who observed this phenomena were my wife, Mr. and Mrs. ____, and Mr. and Mrs. ____ (the latter two are Mr. and Mrs. Ras Tanura).

There were others present but those listed above are the principal witnesses who were in the front of the house at the time this was observed.

This information is being passed on for what it may be worth. Our people have any confidence, and it is my belief that your organization would be interested to know what I have observed. If you would be interested let me know.

Very truly yours,

Arabian American Oil Co.
