My dear General Samford:

I enclose a letter together with pertinent data compiled by Mr. John C. Watts, Grayson, Kentucky, which, I think, self-explanatory. As you will note, his observations are supplying very detailed information concerning his observation on the third of February, 1955, of an unidentified current.

I think Mr. Watts' information is to be commended for the careful manner in which he has given his information to us. I know that you will give it very careful evaluation.

Very sincerely yours,

(Signed) John G. Watts
