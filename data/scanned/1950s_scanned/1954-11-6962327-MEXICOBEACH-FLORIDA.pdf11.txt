IN EVANSVILLE

Ex-Daytonian Seeks
Mrs. Hodges' Meteor

By BETTY A. DIETZ

When "Mrs. Hodges" meteorite which "fell on Alabama" will wind up in the custody of the Evansville Institute of Arts and Sciences.

For Dr. Stanton Weng, former director of the Evansville Institute, said Monday he will seek the nine-pound meteorite made by the former housewife, Mrs. Hodges.

Mrs. Hodges' husband was blinded by the blow, it is believed to be the only person who was ever hit by a meteorite, according to the Smithsonian. The rock was delivered Monday to the Wright-Patterson Air Force base near Dayton, O. for the U.S. Air Technical Intelligence center officials.

WENG SAID the meteor is of scientific interest for two reasons: first, many have been hit by meteors before Mrs. Hodges was the first to survive, and second, the rock may substantiate the theory that the core of meteors is very cold.

When R. Malcolm Keck, president of the Evansville museum, talked to Mrs. Hodges she was uncertain whether the meteor had been sold. Mrs. Hodges told Kech the rock would be given to the Evansville museum, according to Weng.

Acquisition of the meteor should be a public effort, Weng said, adding that he is convinced the museum which has an all-public participation, is now raising funds for new quarters. We were given the address of Mrs. Hodges in Washington, D.C. and are attempting to get in touch with her, Weng said.
