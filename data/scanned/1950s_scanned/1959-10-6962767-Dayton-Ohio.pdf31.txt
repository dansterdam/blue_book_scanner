NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY) 28 OCTOBER 59
NEAR HONG KONG
CHINA

Your letter - 
My husband and I would appreciate very much further information in Headquarters flying saucer. The news reporting of it sounds very disturbing to us.

Reguests to OUSAF information on niggers or questions as to their identification are very disconcerting. For this reason I have held from reporting an unusual sighting on October 28, 1957. The incident occurred near Hong Kong, China. My husband and I regretfully felt it best to disregard the sighting and not dispatch any further information. Please advise us as to a proper procedure for reporting unusual sightings if you consider this report of possible interest.

Thank you.

As the time of my husband's sighting was among the U.S. Navy and a limited number of civilian witnesses, I would appreciate his name not being further disclosed. Please reply to a post office box number if you have any questions or require additional information. The incident information is factual.
