Transcribing the text from the document:

Det #5, 4715th Ground Observer Squadron, Joplin Air Defense Filter Center, Joplin, Missouri, Subject: Unidentified Flying Object, 13 Aug 58

This officer feels that in view of the insufficient information, a good air technical intelligence report is possible given to the intelligence officer concerning the matter, as this observer saw something, giving an honest account of what was seen, and that this sighting constitutes a valid Unidentified Flying Object.

1. Existence of physical evidence, such as materials and photographs - None.
