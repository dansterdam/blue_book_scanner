---

I thought it was going to hit the car. I was about to ask Dad if he saw it, but before I could it had disappeared.

I never saw it nor any other UFO since.

When I saw it I thought it might have been Sputnik I. It had just been launched about one month before I saw the U.F.O.

If you have any questions,
I will try my best to answer them.

Sincerely yours,
