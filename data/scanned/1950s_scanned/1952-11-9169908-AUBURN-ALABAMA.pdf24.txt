HEADQUARTERS
434TH TROOP CARRIER GROUP (M)
Lawson Air Force Base
Fort Benning, Georgia

17:45 EST 14 November 1952

STATEMENT

1. I landed at Lawson AFB at 17:05 EST 6 November 1952 after a flight from Campbell AFB, Tennessee. I parked and had just become prevalent in the Lawson AFB area, restricting lateral visibility to an estimated three (3) miles. I noticed and observed (VFR) air station and found that the top of the base was 3,500' to 4,000' MSL and so reported it to Columbia (Ga.) Radio.

2. Approximately 1/2 hour later EST I was traveling up Indianhead Road on Lawson AFB in an automobile with four (4) other officers. The officer driving the automobile had just arrived at Lawson AFB from Campbell AFB in another aircraft within the preceding hour. While looking out and up at the base and smoke he noticed an object in the sky which appeared to be about the size of a basketball. The object was motionless and remained so for approximately one (1) minute. The object was WWW of our position and at an elevation of about 60 degrees. The object was visible and of a variable intensity.

3. The object was intermittently visible above the haze but was moving slowly. The object was all I: estimated the altitude of the object at 4,000 feet to 7,000 feet MSL.

4. Official sunset at Lawson AFB was at 17:45 EST on 8 November 52. The object was shining as with reflected sunlight and appeared to be round. It appeared to be a large weather balloon of the type used for atmospheric soundings and I dismissed it from my mind as such until later contacted by the Intelligence Officer, USAFSS-TROOPS, Carroll Wing.
