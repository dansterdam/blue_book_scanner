Flying 'Ice Cream Cone' 
Reported Over Alameda
Army Intelligence at Hamilton
Field yesterday was investigating
reports that a giant "flying ice
cream cone" was seen drifting
southward over the Alameda Naval
Air Station at 5:55 p.m. Tuesday. 
The air station reported the sighting
to the office of the air force intelligence officer, and an investigation
was ordered. 
At 5:55 p.m. Tuesday, trailing a
gray parachute, the strange object
was observed.
The cone flew slowly south over
the air station at a height of about
1,000 feet, then abruptly on its side
and headed northwest at a high
rate of speed.
The air station, which immediately turned the report over to G-2,
said the object was not a weather
balloon. It had not sent out any meteorological balloons Tuesday and was
at a lower elevation than that at
which such balloons could be
launched.
Observers at the Alameda include
Lieutenant Commander J. A. Mathis
and Lieutenant R. T. Moore, also of
San Leandro.
