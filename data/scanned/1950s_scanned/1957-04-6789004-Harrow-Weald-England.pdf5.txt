Reference TIMSG, UFO Report INB-2-7D-1170, dated 26 Apr 57
regarding sighting over Harrow-Weald, England. Data submitted
insufficient upon which to base firm conclusions or make sound
scientific analysis. However, description of maneuvers of object
characteristic of aircraft at high altitudes (allowing for known
inability or difficulty of laymen to properly describe moving
objects against night sky), typical of hundreds received during the
ten-year existence of UFO Project, and later found to be aircraft.

Comments of preparing officer, ruling out aircraft because no
sound heard or additional lights observed, not considered valid,
Repeatedly proven that aircraft, singly or in large formations at
high altitudes can manifest themselves day or night without being
heard. During day, aircraft at high altitudes can be observed
