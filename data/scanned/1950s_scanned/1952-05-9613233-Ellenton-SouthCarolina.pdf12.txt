REPORT TO CIVILIAN DEFENSE INVESTIGATORS

Subject: Object seen and photographed by [redacted] (12 years old) in the early afternoon of Sunday, May 4, 1952.

While playing in his backyard at [redacted] in San Francisco, California on the afternoon of Sunday, May 4, 1952, the witness reported he saw a whitish-orange object, which could have been round but from the distance appeared to be oblong, descending rapidly from the sky and stop stationary over the house. He saw the sky and a few stationary trees for comparison and is certain this object is not found among them. He was very excited about this and how this object did not move further except to flicker briefly. 

With great presence of mind he ran into the house and grabbed his Brownie camera. As he came out the object was still there and he snapped a picture of it. The object then changed its attitude and started to rise, eventually disappearing from sight.

He told the kids in his classroom about it, and took a lot of kidding, and everyone told him nothing would show up on the film when developed. However, he was sure of what he had seen and was delighted when the film was developed, as the object showed up on the photograph, which is a faint but definite object of unusual appearance.

We are indebted to Mrs. [redacted], the witness's teacher, for the information leading to this report.
