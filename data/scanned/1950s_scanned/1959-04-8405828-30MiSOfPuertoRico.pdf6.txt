Text Extracted from the Document:

In the east on April 15, the beginning of the total eclipse occurs at 5:45 a.m. local time. The eclipse reaches totality at 7:00 a.m. local time and ends at 8:24 a.m. local time.

The path of the totality is seen to extend from the southwest Pacific Ocean to the southwestern Pacific Ocean, crossing over the northeast part of Australia near Perth, Australia.

This eclipse will be at its maximum where the path of totality crosses the Caroline Islands. The path of totality is approximately 250 miles wide at its widest point.

The eclipse will be at its maximum where the path of totality crosses the Caroline Islands. This eclipse will last for a total duration of about 7 minutes over the Caroline Islands.

Other parts of Australia, including the island of Tasmania, and the southeastern part of Australia will see a partial eclipse. 

This eclipse will be the longest total solar eclipse of 1959, and one of the longest of the 20th century.

Observers who are able to view this eclipse from within the path of totality will be afforded an excellent opportunity to study the various phenomena associated with a total solar eclipse.
