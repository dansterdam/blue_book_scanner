The image appears to be a map or chart, possibly from a military or aviation document. It contains a detailed geographical map, with various locations and features labeled. There is also a "WARNING AREA" box labeled "CCO" in the bottom portion of the image.

As per the instructions, I will now act as an OCR system and produce all the text found in the document:
