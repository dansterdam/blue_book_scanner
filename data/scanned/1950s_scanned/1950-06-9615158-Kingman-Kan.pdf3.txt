This letter responds to your letter of November 21, 1957. We appreciated learning of your unusual experience and will file your letter for information purposes. At this late date it would be impractical to undertake a detailed investigation. It is discernible that this sighting is not possible. This enables the Air Force and yet to perform a comprehensive investigation.
