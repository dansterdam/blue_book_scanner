UFO SIGHTING
ROME, SCHENECTADY, ROCHESTER, N.Y.
9 - 10 APRIL 1956

On 9 April 1956, at 03152, Capt. [redacted], and the first officer of an American Airlines aircraft sighted an unidentified flying object while on a scheduled flight from Rochester, N.Y. to Oswego, N.Y. The object appeared the size of an aircraft on the ground from 5500 feet, was a bright orange and slightly larger than the aircraft, and appeared at equal speed. (Aircraft heading 270° at 5000'.) The weather was reported as clear.

This object was also reported by the crews of four other flights who thought it was probably a star or planet. Other planes reported at 03152 and were on the same heading in the area. No instructions were given to the airliner to deviate from course.

The object was observed by the shift supervisor in the tower at Griffiss Air Force Base. The minute movement captured the object was found to be about the size of a pea held at arm's length, was white with an orange tint, and after about 10 minutes appeared orange with a red tint. The object was reported as larger than any other. The object was observed from the Griffiss Tower and appeared to be at three to four thousand feet. The object was observed to depart the horizon about 3:05 p.m. (probably in error) when it disappeared.

Conclusion:
At 03202 on 9 - 10 April 1956, the planet Venus was just on the horizon and at an altitude of approximately 300 - 305°. Venus was very prominent and bright during the time of the sighting. Since the object was identified as a star or planet by the interest a/c (scrambled for identification) and 4 other a/c in the area it is believed Venus was definitely the cause of these sightings.
