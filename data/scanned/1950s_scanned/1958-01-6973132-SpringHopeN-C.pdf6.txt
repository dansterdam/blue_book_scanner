There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned document page with text describing the Morehead Planetarium, one of the six Zeiss planetariums in the western hemisphere, and its operational hours and program details.

The Morehead Planetarium, one of the six Zeiss planetariums in the western hemisphere, and the one on the University campus, is open for public shows every evening at 8:30, 1:00 and 8:30 on Saturday and 3:30 on Sunday. The program is changed frequently. There is always something new at the Morehead Planetarium. The Morehead Building contains, in addition to the Planetarium, the Gymnasium and other Academic facilities. Also, there are rooms devoted to temporary art exhibits. The 35-foot Copernican orrery, one of only two such installations in the world, is a particularly impressive mechanism.
