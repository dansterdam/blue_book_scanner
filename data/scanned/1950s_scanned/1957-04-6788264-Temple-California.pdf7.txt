Another datum that is perhaps relevant is found in the Los Angeles Examiner and Los Angeles Examiner, A.M. two days earlier. The incidents were awakened by the "so-called" thunder and lightning, and continued to be off the usual "hush-hush" way. A hole, about 5 inch wide, 4 feet deep conical, hole was found in the backyard of the home of said Temple. He informed the officer when he went to school, and told his neighbors about it that evening. Murray informed the Temple City of the investigation, and the matter came to the attention of the Air Force. It was said that "something from the air had entered the ground" â€” the possibility of a meteorite or "one of these confounded flying saucers" could not be ruled out, according to Capt. Jackson's report. Jackson said that they would continue to dig to a depth of 50 feet, and should not excavate the nearby vegetable plot any further. According to the attached military doctor report, there was no indication for all of the children California flying saucers. Of course, the possibility that the "object" responsible for the hole was a meteorite is strong, although some doubt was expressed. But the connection between this incident and flying saucers was not indicated, according to Capt. Jackson.
