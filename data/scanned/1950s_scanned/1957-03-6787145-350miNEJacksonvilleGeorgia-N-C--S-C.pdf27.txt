UNIVERSITY of PENNSYLVANIA
PHILADELPHIA 4

1958 January 28

The Commanding Officer, A.T.C., Lt. (UNCENSORED)
Vertical Testmens Air Force Base,
Dayton, Ohio.

Dear Sirs:

Before making my request, I had better tell you my official position. I am Professor and Chairman of the Astronomy Department of the University of Penna. From 1925-1955, when I had to retire by automatic rule, I was director of the Flower and Cook Observatories. I have a long record of research in astronomy on the university staff, and I arn well known to astronomers everywhere. 

Now as to my request. On 1957 March 15 at about 10 P.M. E.S.T., a very brilliant fireball was observed by many persons in the Gulf States region, probably S.W. of New Orleans, in or near the Gulf, from the Navy Dept. I have had many very circum stantial accounts from eyewitnesses, some of which seem very precise and important. These seem to me to be worthy of careful scientific analysis.

Further, as this was an astronomical body, with nothing mysterious about it, there can be no reason why reports should be classified or withheld from responsible scientists.

I most earnestly request you to have the reports on this event that may be in your files collated and made available to me, and I will be happy to communicate the results I obtain.

Ground during the most recent World War. I found the local commanders quite cooperative during the Second World War, and I hope I may have your cooperation in this instance.

Very sincerely yours,
(SIGNATURE REDACTED)
Dept. of Astronomy,
University of Penna.
