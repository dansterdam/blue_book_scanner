At night observation from seacoast of 2 objects described as small, appeared and moved sharply to left. Disappeared in about 5 secs. Second observation of two objects about half hour before sunset. Small, not more than 5' in diameter, brightly colored with a blunt tail. Traveled a few seconds parallel to horizon-top and a small of white light exploded from object without disturbing shape of the first. After a few seconds both objects vanished. Thought to be an electrical display of some kind.
