SCHWARTZ, IRVINE R., PFC, RA L-299174
DATE: Company APO 85, 6 November 1957 - DATE: The above referenced report is submitted herewith:
At approximately 0200, 6 November 1957, I was standing outside OF 207, Barracks when I observed a very bright flash, all around the OF. The flash was very bright and seemed to illuminate the area. After a few seconds the light disappeared.
(Map) 232 - position and as an elevation of 60-. The flash appears to have originated about 500 meters south-southeast of our position and as an elevation of 60-. The flash appeared to be on or slightly above the ground and lasted for about 15 minutes. I could not see the thing like it, but the area in the direction of the flash seemed to be illuminated as though something had ignited there.
It did not appear to be anything like aircraft, meteor, or other normal known phenomena. The object did not leave anything behind and I could hear no sound associated with it. It just appeared very bright, lit up the area, and then disappeared.
