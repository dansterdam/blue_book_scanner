There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Base Operations Officer: A field trip was made on 9-7-58 to determine the exact sight of an object seen on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The spot was located approx. 2 miles east of the Greensburg exit, in a triangle formed by the turnpike, U.S. Route #40 and S.R. Route 5, 4-5 miles SW of Greensburg. A Helicopter and we proceeded to the area. four different trails were observed within no results. It is the opinion of the reporting officer that unless the supposed object crashed or disabled in the area, no evidence would be found as to size, origin, composition and mode of propulsion, as comments can be made.
