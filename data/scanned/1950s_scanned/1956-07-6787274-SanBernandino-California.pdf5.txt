HEADQUARTERS
27TH AIR DIVISION (DEFENSE)
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
Norton Air Force Base, California

SPOT 
3727-55T: Negative of UFOB

TO: Commander
    Air Defense Command
    Ent Air Force Base
    Colorado

The reference is made to Air Intelligence Information Report (Form No. 112.1-0) dated 25 August 1956, with subject: "UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT SIGHTING, SAN BERNARDINO, CALIFORNIA". A photographic negative of the unidentified flying object was attached to this report. This negative was returned to the source at the address given in the report. At the time of the sighting the conditions were such that the negative was not considered as evidence to justify up the negative and did not carry with it the address assumption as the report was returned as soon as practical.

2. On 14 October 1956, an article appeared in the "Aviation Week" column of the Los Angeles Examiner referring to this incident. This article indicated that the Air Force had stated this negative was not returned to the source. This statement is not correct. The negative was returned to the source as indicated in the report and is attached to this letter.

3. It is possible that considerable publicity adverse to the best interests of the Air Force could result from this statement if subject negative is not returned to the "source" as soon as practicable.

FOR THE COMMANDER:
