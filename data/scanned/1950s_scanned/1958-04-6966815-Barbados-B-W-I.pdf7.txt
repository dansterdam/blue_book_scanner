THE END OF SPUTNIK THE 2ND.

At about five to ten on Sunday night, as I was closing the front door, I noticed a brightly glowing object in the sky, flashing on and off. This object seemed to be just above the verandah, and on moving out into the verandah I saw an object a little smaller than the moon, flashing on and off, moving up and down, and in several directions. It was like balls with some attached, and these were emitting light which seemed to pulsate. The object was as high as the planes some in and around the area, and moved very rapidly in various directions. There was no sound or whiz or anything to indicate speed, but there was a flickering of the lights, as though this object was like an automobile headlight which was flickering. This object held my attention for about two or three minutes, and then it disappeared, not suddenly, but the light faded and went out, and in other rases it would be on and then it would be off, and perhaps after thirty seconds or a minute it would be on again. But there were no more than one and one half or maybe two minutes at the most that it was out of sight. In other words it could not have been more than one and one half or maybe two minutes at the most that it was not visible.

As you will note the tail of the first object bloomed out, whereas the tails of the smaller which were attached to each bloomed in and shrank without having.

The handwritten annotations at the bottom of the document appear to be notes or scribbles and do not contain any additional text.
