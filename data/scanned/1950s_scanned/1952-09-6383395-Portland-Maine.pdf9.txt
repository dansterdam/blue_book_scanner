The page contains a diagram labeled "VHF OMNI-DIRECTIONAL RADIO RANGE DESCRIPTION" along with aeronautical symbols, navigation lights data, and radio facilities information. Specific sections are defined, including aerodrome data, air navigation lights, radio facilities, miscellaneous information, and very high frequencies (VHF).

VHF OMNI-DIRECTIONAL RADIO RANGE DESCRIPTION
The VHF omni-directional range provides visual track guidance along any
selected radial from the station out to a  distance of  of approximately 50. miles
when flying at the minimum instrument altitude. These ranges operate in 
the frequencies between 112  and 118 megacycles and require a special omni
range type recelver to make use of the navigational features. Also provided
are simultaneous voice communication and 3-letter (coded) identification. In
operation, the pilot selects a course by setting the pointer on a course or radial
selector to the desired magnetic bearing and then flies that course by refer-
ence to a cross pointer instrument.
