II. SOURCES' DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
"At approximately 10:45 I. (20 March 1956) I was driving along Leland to Traverse City. About 10 miles north of Leland, on a west road, I observed a bright metallic, disc-shaped object hovering at an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 feet altitude. It was approximately 50-75 feet in diameter. I watched it for about 3-5 minutes before it simply faded out. I didn't hear any sounds."
