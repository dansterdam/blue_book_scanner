Weatherman Spots a Saucer High Over Iowa
By the United Press
SIOUX CITY, Iowa, March 31 -- Fourteen Iowans, including the sweaihig ranks of the U.S. Weather Bureau, said they saw a silver discus-like object, which they thought at first was a weatherman's weather observation balloon.
"Then I decided it wasn't," he said.
Mrs. Jess said the object appeared to be about the size of a small automobile and that it flashed out of sight. At the same time, she said, the object made a slight roaring noise.
Simon City officials who have had some experience in observational work at the Municipal Airport said the object appeared to be white, round "something" apparently following a straight line course. 
U.S. Air Force officials repeatedly have denied any knowledge of the saucer reports.
