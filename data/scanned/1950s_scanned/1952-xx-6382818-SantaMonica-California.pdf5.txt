Sir:

I wish to report two sightings, this date, of the so-called "flying saucer" objects. The first as follows:

Watching the sun setting behind clouds from the park at Ocean Parkway I noticed first one then up to six bright objects in close group and a location surrounded mostly by clouds. The appeared and disappeared in streaks one then two such objects appeared about a mile to the East, of which one remained very visible for awhile then took off rapidly in a direction almost straight away. Diminishing in size and brilliance, after about 2-3 minutes this object came back, leaving a slight vapor trail. Then somewhat to the right and below the first group a wide vapor trail formed and a group of 7 or 8 such objects formed into a squadron formation and remained stationary for several minutes. Then some of the objects disappeared and others appeared in group No. 2. Then three bright objects simply disappeared whilst the clouds around the location remained just as brightly lit. This ended about 12 - 15 minutes before sunset.

The second sighting was at 11:30 whilst walking home from Santa Monica Blvd. Directly beneath the moon, about 3 diameters, I noted an elongated bright object of about 1/4 moon diameter long and 1/16th thickness, stationary for several minutes. It took less than 30 seconds to open my door, drop the load and grab 6x35 Geers [glasses] and look for the object. It was gone but left a vapor trail which went up left at about 40Â°. This object also was quite brilliant of a minus 2 rating. General search failed to show any traces of it. The sky around the moon was quite clear with just a few traces of whisps of cirrus."

I would be interested whether you have had any other reports on these objects.

Sincerely
