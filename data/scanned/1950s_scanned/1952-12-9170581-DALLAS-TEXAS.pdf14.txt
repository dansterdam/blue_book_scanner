The image appears to contain a photograph, but it is not visible in the provided document. The text in the document describes an incident related to an AN/APG-11 indicator and some details about the maneuvers and behavior of the phenomenon observed. The text is provided below:

The scope face of the AN/APG-11 indicator was slightly out of focus, and the pictures that it gave the operator, took in a search do not show the phenomenon clearly. As the operator explained on the search, prolonged surveillance of the phenomenon on the APG-11 indicator produced no clear photograph.

Weather conditions: Immediate area was clear, nearest cloud formations were approximately 10 miles distant. There was a cloud deck below the B-36 at a low altitude.

An AN/APG-23 phenomenon was similar to recent AIFEC release of PPI photographs of sightings made over Washington, D.C. 

PPI photographs of AN/APG-11 scope are available. These are the G-15 films referred to and discussed in 3 above. These and the Krichen film referred to in 3-2 above will all be available in the Armament Procurement Engineering Building 22, Post 24A, Phone 20121 or 26235, and the office symbol is WCRGL-1.

The maneuvers consisted of turns, climbs, and dives (to the extent of the B-36's capabilities) so that they pointed towards a point in space traveling a path parallel and then suddenly disappearing with the air speed indicator on the B-36 indicating a speed of 2000 miles per hour. Whenever the B-36 established a new heading so that the phenomenon was estimated to be in front of the B-36 this new reading was so fast that the phenomenon was 2 or 3 miles ahead of the B-36 before they lost it. Then suddenly the phenomenon would reappear and the G-11 would again detect and lock on it. (see the AN/APG-11 operator's statement (item 8) for details.

No air traffic was observed in the Dallas area at the time of the electronic sighting.
