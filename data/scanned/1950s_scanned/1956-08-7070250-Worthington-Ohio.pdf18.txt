NO CASE (INFORMATION ONLY)
23 AUGUST 1956 
TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA

Case 199. Torrance, Cal. Aug. 23, 1956â€”Headlined the Torrance Press: "Is Guardsmen See Flying Saucer". The men are members of Torrance's Naval Guard unit. According to those who observed the UFO was Capt. Douglas Hollaender, CO of Co. B 112nd Armored Engineer Battalion. Said Capt. Hollaender, "It was 6:10 p.m. Our convoy was about six miles north of Santa Barbara at Goleta. We was sitting in the front of the jeep, half asleep. Suddenly, M/Sgt. William Lyons pointed up, and we saw the shoulder of a large, silvery object rising slowly, like the top of a tin can. It was sitting at about 1000 ft. elevation. It was round and shiny like the top of a tin can. First I thought it was a blimp, but it was at a 45 degree angle from us, toward the left. All at once it seemed sideways and then instantly up to about 5000 ft. in a tight angle, like the boom of a weather balloon, but suddenly it came down again to a 2000 ft. elevation. We saw the object for about eight minutes until it seemed to pause and then make a downward turn. It was time to halt the convoy. Some of the men had seen the object, too. To look at them, you'd think they'd seen a ghost. Added the Captain, "The object was definitely not an aircraft, balloon, or missile, we don't think." Said Sgt. Lyons, "I don't think it was possibly from outer space. I don't think we have anything like it."
