AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
D/T: 29 20th Air Force, APO 239 IR 1-53 PAGE 2 OF 2 PAGES
7/3L Radar reports of slow moving aircraft between 4500' and 5500' indicated (sic) weather phenomena. VALIDITY OF REPORTED SIGHTINGS: The validity of reported sightings appears doubtful because: (1) radar reported only stationary or slow moving objects; (2) observed objects did not appear to maneuver in a manner unusual for conventional aircraft; (3) radiosonde balloons were observed at this time; (4) unusually bright stars, planets and atmospheric phenomena were observed during this period.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
This is second reported sighting of unidentified object in this vicinity during 1952-53 period. Radar reports indicated objects were not conventional type aircraft, however, validity of sightings is doubtful because of possible other explanations noted by reporting officer.
