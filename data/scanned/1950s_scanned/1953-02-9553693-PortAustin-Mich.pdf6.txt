AT 2205 EST ON 17 FEBRUARY 1953, AN UNIDENTIFIED LIGHT WAS SIGHTED VISUALLY BY A 15 YEAR AERONAUTICS ON GUARD DUTY. I WAS NOTIFIED OF THE SIGHTING AND MADE AN OBSERVATION OF IT. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN OR APPEARED TO HOVER AT APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET ABOVE THE HORIZON. AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, VISIBILITY AND CEILING WERE UNLIMITED. I OBSERVED THE OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO CHANGE FROM RED TO PINK TO WHITE AND THEN RED AGAIN, FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE, AFTER WHICH TIME I ATTEMPTED TO OPERATE THE OBJECT ON THE APN-3. AT 2209 EST, I "PICKED-UP" THE TARGET AT GS 4904 AND TRACKED IT FOR 17 MINUTES, HEADING 140 DEGREES AT 35 TO 50 KNOTS, AT WHICH TIME, 2225 EST AT UP 5249, THE TARGET FADED INTO THE STATION GROUND CLUTTER. UPPER BEAM LOBE WAS THE ONLY POSITION I WAS ABLE TO RECEIVE A RADAR RETURN ON THIS OBJECT.
