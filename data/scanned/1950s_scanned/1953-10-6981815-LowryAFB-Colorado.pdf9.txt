The report did not send any item to the ground and when it disappeared to appear again, it did not strike any object in the air. I do not believe it was an airplane or any other type of aircraft. The object was seen approximately three years of September 1950, and had been studied by several weeks mechanics.
I further state that I have read this entire statement, initialed all the pages, and dictated or signed this statement freely, and this statement is correct and true as written.

The original copies of the above statements are being retained in the files of this district office and will be made available to authorized Air Force personnel upon request.
At about 0800 hours, 30 October 1953, special agent G. A. K. telephonically contacted the informant who stated that the object had not been seen by him or his coworkers since early October 1953. Inquiries indicate this report was released to the public September 1957, BLUE BOOK file no. 1234.
