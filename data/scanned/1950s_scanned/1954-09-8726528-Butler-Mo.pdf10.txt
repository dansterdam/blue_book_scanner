C-22, Rockford, Ill. - 9/5/54) As they had done on many occasions, amateur astronomers, Pete Barricus and Theodore Boglich, were watching the moon through 6" cassegrainian reflector telescope using a secondary mirror. The total focal length for this setup was over 50 feet, and the moon was centrally placed. The moon was in the first quarter and its diameter was 20 feet, 10 inches. We saw a spherical object ascending from the northern section of the Humboldt diam area. It was not glowing or brilliant, but a black silhouette. As the object rapidly increased in diameter, it appeared to be traveling more than the 2000' per second. It tracked more than the 20' 30" of arc in about 40 minutes. We checked out the possibility of atmospheric diffractions in the sky or the object by traversing the soop and could not find any explanation, except that as the moon was descending at 1081 m.p.h, the object was ascending and not following a true orbit. It was definitely in space, and in the same field as the moon, or near the moon.
