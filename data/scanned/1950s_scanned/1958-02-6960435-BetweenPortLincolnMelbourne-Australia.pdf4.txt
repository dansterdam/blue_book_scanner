At 1420 hrs. G.M.T. 9th. February 1958 whilst in the above position a contrail was observed to form about 75 degrees altitude and bearing 230 degrees from the ship. The contrail developed rapidly passed over the vessel smith and faded out at about 45 degrees altitude and disappeared at an altitude of about 15 degrees on the same bearing, and in direction over the horizon.

The contrail appeared to originate from some fast moving body and the height was estimated at plus 50,000 feet. The contrail remained visible for about thirty minutes gradually dissipating with the extinction of time, it was observed to form and disappear.

The second officer likened the contrail to the trails left by V.2. rockets when launched having observed such launchings from the North Sea during 1944.
