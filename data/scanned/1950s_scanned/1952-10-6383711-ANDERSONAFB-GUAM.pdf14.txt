UNCLASSIFIED
HEADQUARTERS
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT CHIEF OF STAFF, INTELLIGENCE

TO: Charles W. Gettings
DATE: Oct 6, 1952

This office time was alerted 7 Oct 52. After initiating off was a fruitless observation of an object in the sky at approximately 2300 hours 6 Oct 52.
The object observed appeared to have an intense but pulsating light which maneuvered in a manner which would be impossible for any known aircraft, staying in a hovering position, making sharp turns, and rapidly gaining or losing altitude for periods of approximately ten (10) seconds.
The object was under observation for approximately thirty (30) minutes after which time it suddenly disappeared. There was no sound emanating from the object and on one or two occasions it seemed to generate or exhibit a light similar to a cigarette being dragged. All personnel observing the object were of the opinion that the object was some type of unidentified flying object, the size of which was estimated to be approximately ten (10) feet in diameter.
