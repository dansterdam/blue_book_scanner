UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS

The observer reports that while on the roof of her house, she observed 3 circular, bright objects, approximately 50 feet in diameter, passing overhead in a southwesterly direction at an altitude estimated to be between 3,000 and 5,000 feet. The objects were luminous and had a slight orange glow. They were observed for approximately 2-3 minutes before disappearing from sight. The observer reported the objects were moving at a high rate of speed, much faster than any known aircraft.
