There is an illustration rather than a photograph on the page. The illustration is a compass-like diagram showing cruising altitudes based on magnetic courses, designated for even and odd thousands of feet in various directions.

**CRUISING ALTITUDES**

**CRUISING ALTITUDES WITHIN CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES** During VFR conditions aircraft at altitudes of 3000 feet or more above the surface within control zones and control areas, including controlled airways, must be flown at odd or even 1000-foot levels appropriate to the direction of flight. "Odd" and "Even" indicators are shown on Coast and Geodetic Survey Radio Facility Charts. Under IFR conditions within control zones and control areas, indicating controlled airways, altitudes will be flown in accordance with ATC clearances.

The following rules will govern the altitudes at which aircraft shall fly when making VFR flights along controlled civil airways:

Green and Red Airways and Even-numbered VOR Airways
Eastbound flights. Aircraft shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet.)
Westbound flights. Aircraft shall fly at an EVEN thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 4000, 6000, or 8000 feet.)

Amber and Blue Airways and Odd-numbered VOR Airways
Northbound flights. Aircraft shall fly at an ODD thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 3000, 5000, or 7000 feet.)
Southbound flights. Aircraft shall fly at an EVEN thousand-foot altitude above sea level (such as 4000, 6000, or 8000 feet.)

The following rules will apply on segments where color airways and VOR airways overlap:
Where a color airway coincides with a VOR airway, the ODD or EVEN rule for the appropriate color airways will apply.
Where no color airway is involved and an Even-numbered and an Odd-numbered VOR airway coincide, the ODD or EVEN altitude rule for the Even-numbered VOR airway will apply.

**CRUISING ALTITUDES OUTSIDE CONTROL AREAS AND ZONES** When the flight visibility is less than three miles, aircraft must be flown at an altitude appropriate to the magnetic course as illustrated below.

                          0°
                            EVEN THOUSANDS
                            (PLUS 500)

270° EVEN THOUSANDS ——— ODD THOUSANDS 90°
                   (PLUS 500)    (PLUS 500)

                          180°
                   MAGNETIC COURSES
(Illustration applies only to flight outside of control zones and control zones, including uncontrolled airways)

**VISUAL FLIGHT PLAN**
The Civil Air Regulations do not require that a VFR flight plan be filed for a VFR flight. However, the flying of such a flight plan is desirable, and the CAA urges that VFR flights be covered by flight plan whenever practicable as such flying materially assists in search and rescue operations if such action becomes necessary. Flight plans may be submitted to the nearest CAA airway communications station either in person or by telephone. Flight plans may be filed by radio if no other means are available but this practice should be avoided whenever possible to reduce congestion of radio channels.

If filing the flight plan, the pilot should state the name of the CAA communications station with which he will close his flight plan, If the destination is not served by a CAA communications station, or is in Canada or Mexico, the method by which this arrival report will be filed must be clearly understood by all concerned, VFR flight plans are transmitted via CAA communications facilities only to the CAA communications station with which the pilot has stated his arrival report or closing of flight plan will be filed. One hour after the estimated time of arrival, if no notice of arrival is received, inquiries are sent out over CAA communications systems to determine the location of the aircraft. If no information concerning the aircraft is obtained after an exhaustive communications inquiry, search and rescue operations are inaugurated. In as much as the government may be put to considerable expense in determining the location of aircraft when an arrival report is not filed, it is utmost necessary that all pilots make certain that notices of arrival is filed. If flight is terminated prior to reaching the point of intended destination specified in the flight plan, pilots should contact the nearest CAA communications station and request that an arrival report be transmitted over CAA facilities to the CAA communications station with which the pilot stated the arrival report would be filed.

Pilots of aircraft operating on VFR flight plan who desire to make flight progress reports, should include in the report the phrase: "VFR FLIGHT PLAN FROM (blank) TO (blank)."

The flight plan shall contain the items listed under INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES - Flight Plan, except "Alternate Airport" and" contact a visual flight plan and invariably say "VFR" as a cruising altitude. The witch this operates visit appropriate engineer of the pilot intended for its incoherence with Visual Flight Rules. Aircraft may be operated in accordance with VFR above a well-defined under (or the engineer of helicopter), climb to and descent from "top top" flight can also be in accordance with VFR.
