AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: (ACTIVITY)
FLIGHT 3-8-T, 4602d AISS
TO: A sergeant with Hampton-Sydney College, Hampton, Virginia, reports that two lights were observed on 25 April 1956 at approximately 7:10 pm. He states that these lights were observed from the campus of the college and were approximately 38 feet off the ground, circular in shape, and approximately 15 to 20 feet in diameter. He states that the lights remained stationary for approximately 10 to 15 minutes and then suddenly accelerated and disappeared. He further states that the lights were a bright reddish-orange color and that there was no noise associated with the objects. He also states that he observed the lights through binoculars and that they remained stationary throughout the observation. It might be noted that Sirius would have been seen in approximately the same area of the sky at that time and that the objects observed might have been the planet Venus, which was visible in the western sky at that time. No photographs were taken of the objects.
