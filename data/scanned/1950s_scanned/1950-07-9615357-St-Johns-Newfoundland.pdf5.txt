SYNOPSIS

Shortly after 2200 hours on 31 July 1950 an unidentifiable object was sighted travelling in a westerly direction over the vicinity of St. John's, Newfoundland. No details of the object were visible and it appeared as a bright greenish light under the overcast. It seemed to break into two distinct pieces each of which became a dull colored light and then to disappear.

DETAILS

stated at 2205 hours 31 July '50, I was in front of Building 805 driving Southwest and heading toward the area known as VOQ. Which is just behind Bldg. 805 and on the Instal # 3. New Pepperell AFB. At the intersection of Smelling Avenue and Avenue We turned East and as we turned we looked South and saw a moving green light under the overcast. I stomped the car and saw the object going from east to west. It was travelling very fast. It moved in a straight line and I watched it for about 10 seconds. It was dark and all I could see was the light portion. It appeared as a small round light, very bright, but made no rejection on the clouds. I distinguished no sounds; as I watched it broke into two distinct pieces and each became a dull colored light, then they disappeared. When it broke, the pieces kept going for a short distance on the (vel before they dropped slightly and went out without leaving sparks or any other visible trace.

Auditor General Department, USAF was questioned, and stated, at approximately 2200 hours 31 July '50, I was in my room in the BOQ looking out of the window toward Signal Hill which overload St. John's, Nfld.
