MR. ON n REPORT DATE JULY 8, 195?
REGARDING YOUR REQUEST 0N JUNE 28, 1952 TO LOOK INTO SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT WHICH WAS STILL VISIBLE, INFORMATION IS STILL RESTRICTED. THE ORIGINAL REPORT DOES NOT CONTAIN ENOUGH DATA FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY POSITIVELY THE OBJECT SEEN AS IT WAS APPARENTLY DARKS SILHOUETTE AGAINST AN EVENING SKY. MAKING DETAILED IDENTIFICATION IS NOT EASY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE DURATION OF SIGHTING WAS ONLY ABOUT 1.5 MINUTES OR LESS, AND WITNESS COULD NOT IDENTIFY IT WITH CERTAINTY. IT WAS SIMPLY 'THING' TO HIM AT THE TIME. THAT CONCLUDES MY REPORT ON THIS MATTER. LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS.
