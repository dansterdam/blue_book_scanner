(11) This report prepared by the Operations Staff Officer, 14th Fighter Group
USAF. It should be noted that this USAF report holds some validity, since one of the reporting witnesses was a military officer. The case is rated as UNIDENTIFIED, probable celestial phenomenon, being a very bright stationary light, similar to the Littleton sighting last week with a local police official. If this was a celestial phenomenon, then it was no closer or higher than the reported 1600' to 2200' altitude. There is, however, no indication in the report of any associated effects, such as maneuvering, color changes, sound, or vapor trails observed, and this was no time from an aircraft because it was perfectly stationary. With this in mind, the case is considered UNIDENTIFIED.
