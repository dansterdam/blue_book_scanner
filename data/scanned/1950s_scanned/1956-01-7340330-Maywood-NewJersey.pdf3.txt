(SUMMARY DATA)

THE EARLY MORNING OF 21 JAN 1956 - REPORT HAVING COMPLETED A ROUND THROUGH CHEMICAL PLANT WHERE I AM EMPLOYED AS A GUARD. WAS HOME ABOUT 5 A.M. COMING OUT TO STAND POST WHEN I NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT LOW IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION TOWARD ROUTE 17 N. IT WAS HOVERING MOTIONLESS IN THE SKY. IT SEEMED TO BE BALL SHAPED AND GAVE OFF A BRIGHT GLOW. IT WAS SOME DISTANCE IN THE SKY. ITS GLOW WAS VERY BRIGHT AND SEVERAL TIMES THE SIZE OF A LARGE STAR. AFTER WATCHING IT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES IT APPEARED TO GAIN SPEED AND HEADED IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION. FIRST CERTAIN - THEN BLUE AND FINALLY YELLOW. IT WAS MUCH LESS BRILLIANT THAN THE BALL. AND DIMINISHED RAPIDLY AS IT MOVED AWAY COMPLETELY OUT OF SIGHT. THE GLOW REFLECTED IN THE SKY WAS EXTREMELY BRIGHT.
