STATEMENT

On October 29, 1956 at approximately 0230 while running practice intercepts as a pilot of three F-86D's under Fronie Control, I was directed to contact Fronie Control. 

On contact with Idaho, the controller requested I proceed to a point near Eddyville, Nebraska. I did so under his direction at 25,000 ft. altitude.

While enroute, I was given the following description of U.F.O.B. sighted in the area by G.C.I.C. "The object is circular in shape with red and green lights around it, altitude unknown, but at a distance that made it appear to be the size of a dime. Both the color and motion were slowly to the east." At the time it was sighted, weather was clear with very good visibility due to the very bright moonlight.

Upon reaching the area, I searched in all directions, also above and below with no success. At this time I requested G.C.I.C. to get visual contact on me and steer me to the object visually. I reduced speed and extended the landing lights for better identification by G.C.I.C.

G.C.I.C. relayed their instructions through Fronie controller and on several occasions carried that I was nearing very near to object.

I was unable to get any contact either visually or on the radar scope.

I continued the search as long as fuel permitted, about 20 minutes, and then returned to Lincoln Air Force Base and landed.
