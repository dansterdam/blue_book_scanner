INFORMATION:
The-Report under consideration deals the the sighting of a bright unidentified light.
The incident occurred near San Diego, California on March 6, 1952. The Report indicates that several observers, including an Air Force captain, independently sighted a bright white light traveling at a high rate of speed. The light was said to be round or elliptical in shape and to have changed direction during the observation. An analysis of the Report leads to the conclusion that the object sighted was not a star, planet, or aircraft. The Report states that the observation appears to be of a genuine unidentified flying object.
EVALUATION:
The Report contains details that tend to establish the validity of the observation. The observers are reported to be reliable and their descriptions of the maneuvers of the light are reasonably consistent. The ability of the object to change direction, and the fact that it was observed by several independent witnesses of various backgrounds, lend credence to the report.
RECOMMENDATION:
No further investigation appears to be warranted at this time. The Report is considered to be of significant interest and should be retained as one of the better documented sightings on record.
APPROVED:
