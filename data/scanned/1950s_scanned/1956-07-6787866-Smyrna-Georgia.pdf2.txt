The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR system, I have produced the following text found in the document:

REPORT NO. 26-UFO-23-56
PART FOUR
PAGE 5 OF 5 PAGES 

COMMENTS OF Preparing Officer:
In the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was probably caused by a low flying aircraft.

The Investigator on two occasions on the night of 6 Aug 56, from his home in Smyrna, Georgia, observed a light in the sky which he believed to be an unidentified flying object.

a. The place of sighting by the source was in a location where it was possible the source could have observed aircraft traffic. Therefore, the 15 degree elevation of the object above the horizon. The reports would be true of the object disappearing.

b. The fact that the source did not hear any noise from the object to identify it as a normal aircraft. In this connection, because of the distance involved, normal aircraft engines in operation may have actually been longer as source only estimated the time.

COMMENTS OF Approving Officer:
Concur with opinion of Preparing Officer that sighting was probably caused by an aircraft.
