APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948 \

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT \


**FROM *(Agency)*:** \

**ATIL Office, DI/ FEAF** \

**REPORT NO:** \

**IR-35-52** \

**PAGE:** 2 **OF** 4 **PAGES** \

**1.** a. Site #4, 528th Aircraft Control and Warning Group, located at Shiroi Air Force Base, was notified of the location of the unidentified object soon after the first visual contact by the tower. The CPS-1 radar is normally operated at maximum range, and contact was attempted on both high and low beams by Lt. Rawlins, the controller on duty. Three or four blips were noted at a position 050° bearing from Haneda, as reported by the tower, but no definite movement could be ascertained, and no Height/Range contact could be made with the CPS-4 due to ground clutter. \
b. Lt. Albert reported for duty at 2345/I, and was soon able to make radar contact on the 5-1G high beam. An F-94 was scrambled to investigate. The object at that time had left the ground clutter and could be tracked at varying speeds in a right orbit. Though impossible to accurately estimate speed, Lt. Albert gave a rough estimate of from 100-150 knots, stopping and hovering occasionally, and a maximum speed during the second orbit (just before F-94 was vectored in) of possibly 250-300 knots. At approximately 0021/I the object reportedly broke into three smaller contacts maintaining an interval of about 1/4 mile, with one contact remaining somewhat tighter. The F-94 was vectored on this object, reporting weak contact at 0015/I and loss of contact at 0018/I. Within a few seconds, both the F-94 and the object entered the ground clutter and were not seen again. \
c. The blips on the CPS-1 were described as small and relatively weak, but sharply defined. The brightness varied somewhat, and at one time appeared very bright as the object appeared to be in a fairly sharp turn at higher speed than previously noted. Both recorded orbits were in approximately the same position with the object moving and occasionally hovering in one position for several minutes. PH, NYF surveillance of area was made for an extended period of time and no further contact was made. \
2. The ADC Controller at Johnson Air Force Base was kept informed of the incident as it took place. Personnel at Site #4 attempted unsuccessfully to make visual contact with the object, which at times was less than ten miles distance from Shiroi Air Force Base. Radar was functioning normally before and after the incident. \
3. The F-84 with Lt. Wesley R. Rider as pilot and lst Lt. Aaron Jones, radar operator, was scrambled at approximately 2555/I. There was a slight delay in becoming airborne due to fuel system trouble during run-up. Aircraft became airborne at 0005/I and was directed to make a search from Haneda Air Force Base northeast over Tokyo Bay. No visual contact was made at any time. \
a. The F-94 crew reported exceptional visibility in the air, with a very thin cloud layer at 11,000 to 16,000 feet and one or two isolated patches of thin clouds lower. The CPS-1 in the tower at Haneda Air Force Base was very clearly seen. The only stars seen at a low elevation were the North Star and Venus. As the F-94 headed North, the Control Tower asked GCI to vector the F-94 toward the east. Looking off their right forward quarter and turning in the direction requested, the F-94 was still unable to see anything unusual. \
b. As the F-94 orbited to the right at approximately 330 knots T.A.S., the GCI radar re-established contact with the object and vectored the F-94 on a course of 040°. GCI called the object at 11 o'clock to the F-94, 5 miles. At this time the F-94 managed to make a weak contact at 007 port, 10° low, at a range of 6,000 yards, \
approximately 300 KT. \
c. The radar contact at approximately 35°T*N-139°5E', was described as weak and small but distinct and definable from the ground clutter encountered. The radar operator, Lt. Jones, was very busy, maintaining the weak contact by manual control. As the object moved across the scope from the port to starboard, it appeared to increase speed and Lt. Jones called for a hard right turn. As the aircraft turned, the object appeared to suddenly accelerate and disappear rapidly from the scope on a course of 046°. \
