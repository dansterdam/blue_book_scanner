Text from the document:

When XXXX I've been in the service through the war and he sk get back back here stateside.So apparently this is where some of the hatchet work was done.

But it has been my experience in life back every time a man XXXX tries to stand up for what's right and uh tries to stand up for uh his own rights. 

There's always somebody who wants to beat him XXXX down. But uh it's been my findings that damn few and far between are the men or the agency of the government body or anyone else has got the courage or the guts to stand up to a man's face and tell him the truth. All try with the XXXX strokes of the pen, indelibly or something XXXXX underhanded way or hidden XXXX back of some office or behind XXXXX military forces some where you would think with the stroke of a pen that this shows great bravery. It shows nothing but cowardness nothing more or less. Now, uhm, there was one other uh instance uh I wanted to get on here. Now as I XXXX have said previously I have been smeared by the experts and when an amateur tried it tries it, it's makes a particularly makes me angry. One instance that I can think of presently is a fast buck artist and a big republican who supposedly owns a village in Venezuela perhaps where he is a maybe a neighbor of Rockefeller and.
