The image contains two sketches. The larger sketch shows a curved trajectory of an object in the sky, with the instructions to mark points "A" and "B" on the curve. The smaller sketches show a landscape view with a person walking on the road, and a close-up view of the curved trajectory of the object.

Now, as an OCR system, I will extract all the text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
