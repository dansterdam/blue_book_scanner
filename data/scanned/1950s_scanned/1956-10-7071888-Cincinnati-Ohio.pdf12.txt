This image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten letter.

Dear Captain,

These photos are connected to the ovoid or circular object which was temporarily sighted and approved by the Project Blue Book team. However, I can no longer provide more information, as the witnesses and others involved have requested their names be withhelds.

Sincerely,
