Colonel, the trainmaster says that northbound train went through
Virgins about 10:30 P.M. last night... that would put it through
Brooklyn about 11:09 o'clock said it arrived in Battlesburg about
11:45 P.M.

Battlesburg at 11:45. Is that the usual time or not?

Mr.

Yes, that's the usual time, Col., there was a northbound train
out of' Elkhart about 9:45 in the morning...

Col Wood:

That wouldn't fit it then.. a little incident happened up in
that area out of my area there of so, it's out while it was on
train projection, thanks it does affect certain military areas.

Mr.

Well, if you want this figure any closer, any other way we can
let' you, 'just let me know and I will get after them. You see,
I called up there and that's what they gave me. I talked to
the trainmaster's office. But that time in Battlesburg 14 spots
it's, and they figure it would be about 10:10 through Virgins,
11:00 minutes Brooklyn.

Col Wood:

Fine. Thank you very much.
