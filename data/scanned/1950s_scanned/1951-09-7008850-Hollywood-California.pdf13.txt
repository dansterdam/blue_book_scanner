from such a distance, we can see, especially through binoculars or telescope, than we can hear. for the obvious reason that while electrons (light) travel at about 186,299 miles per second, while sound, in warm summer air, can barely do about 1,266 feet per second and in zero cold weather from 1,088 to 1,150 feet per second. besides, even if the sound was loud enough to be heard from such a distance, it would describe such a wide arc, that all places, excepting where it bends within hearing range, would be "zones of silence".

sound has many mediums and the rate of speed per feet per second depends upon the medium, iron and steel being the greatest, rating from 16,420 to 17,390 for hot iron and 16,360 for cast steel. just what kind of medium would "space" be? and why should the field of solar flux through which the light we see traveling be called "space"? space is merely the interval between objects, but to most persons it implies emptiness. even though they cannot be seen with human eyes, are not electrons objects too? sound would probably be imperceptible traveling through space (so-called). if the ships in question had wings, i saw none. i doubt if they had any. again comes up the question of distance relative to detail. yet, as the near ship turned, if it had wings i would have detected any such indication; that is, if wings have to be in proportion to the length of the craft, because, even considering the distance, the size was, at least, thrice as long as it was wide.

from such a distance, we can see, especially through binoculars or telescope, than we can hear. for the obvious reason that while electrons (light) travel at about 186,299 miles per second, while sound, in warm summer air, can barely do about 1,266 feet per second and in zero cold weather from 1,088 to 1,150 feet per second. besides, even if the sound was loud enough to be heard from such a distance, it would describe such a wide arc, that all places, excepting where it bends within hearing range, would be "zones of silence".
