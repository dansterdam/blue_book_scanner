On 13 September 1951, at about 1930 hours, a tracked car and a pilot car were observed traveling at a high rate of speed near Monmouth, New Jersey. The pilots reported seeing a silvery object in the sky which was stationary. The object was first observed to be west of the car and was at an elevation of approximately 10,000 feet. The object appeared to be circular in shape and was approximately 50 to 60 feet in diameter. The object was observed to be stationary for several minutes, then it began to move very rapidly in a straight line toward the southwest. It was observed to be going at an extremely high speed and was lost from sight in approximately 10 seconds. This sighting proved to be a worthwhile balloon, for it was determined that at 2330 hours on 13 October 1951, there was a weather balloon launched from an area near Monmouth, New Jersey. The object sighted on 13 September 1951 was probably this weather balloon observed in its last stages of ascent.

On 18 September 1951, at about 1330, a target was detected on an SCR-584 radar at Camp Evans, New Jersey. The target was moving at an extremely high speed and was observed at an elevation of 85,000 feet. The target was tracked for about 20 minutes, during which time it descended to an altitude of 60,000 feet. The target then accelerated and climbed back to an altitude of 85,000 feet. The radar operators were unable to establish any visual contact with the target. It is highly probable that this is an example of an anomalous propagation, which is frequently encountered at elevations above 50,000 feet. At present, the true nature of this phenomenon is not clearly understood, however, since no more physical evidence is available, the case must remain unresolved.
