This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document with heavily redacted text. As an OCR system, I will output the text that is visible in the document:

The object was described as circular in shape and as he looked at it it began to swerve abruptly and then accelerate rapidly straight up and out of sight. The observer stated that the object appeared to be metallic in color and estimated the size of the object to be 30-40 feet in diameter. The observer was in an open field at the time of the sighting and observed the object for approximately 10-15 seconds. There is no further information on the type of propulsion, speed, or trajectory of the object after it accelerated straight up and out of sight.
