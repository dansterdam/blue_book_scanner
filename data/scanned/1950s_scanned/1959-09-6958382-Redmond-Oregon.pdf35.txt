MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR, LEGISLATIVE LIAISON, SAFLL
ATTENTION: Major Kelly, Section C

SUBJECT: Reply to Senator Jackson Regarding UFOs

The following is a draft of a reply to Senator Jackson.

"I refer to your recent inquiry in behalf of Mr. [REDACTED] of Bucoda, Washington concerning the unidentified flying object sightings of 24 September 1959 near Redmond, Oregon.

"On 25 March 1960, the Air Force informed the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena of all of the facts and findings in connection with this particular UFO sighting. A copy of this letter is attached for your information. The letter is self-explanatory and indicates that the finding of "insufficient data" in this particular case was definitely a valid conclusion.

"Charges that the United States Air Force is withholding information from the general public on the subject of unidentified flying objects are completely unfounded. For your information I am enclosing the latest Department of Defense press release which clearly states the position of the Air Force in regard to unidentified flying object sightings."
