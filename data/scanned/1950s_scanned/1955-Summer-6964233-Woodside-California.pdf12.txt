Going 40,000 mph. - I have spoken with the man who is supposed to have seen this object and it appears to me that here is a rather common occurrence. Four 1 3 they came out as was found in a field of blue sky. I was found to be approximately 600 feet in diameter and had a very rapid spinning motion. It appeared to be almost transparent and it seemed to be slightly glowing. Next day several witnesses came in an trying to identify it and very little could be done. The object shortly disappeared from their sight. But I called Mantel's I strongly that this is the same object that Mantell was chasing and that caused his death.

It would seem to me that a certain of UFO reports particularly those that are contingent on our activities or the activities of others, who may or may not be reliable, simply can't be taken very seriously, those are the ones that are contingent by can be confirmed. I think this is simply an account of a common occurrence.

Sincerely Yours.
