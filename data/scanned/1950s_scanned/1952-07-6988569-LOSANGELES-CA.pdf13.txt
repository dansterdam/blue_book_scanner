Report of Sighting - (Coast's.) - 

After moving the car to a spot just slightly to the South of Newberrytawn (on York Haven Road) the objects were no longer visible and the scene of the East of the town had a normal, usual summer evening appearance. A small, blinking light (description light) was observed flying south from the West to East direction far in the distance. This light appeared to be that of an aircraft at about half the altitude of the two previous lights.

To check these observations I would like to ask the following questions answered:
1. Is the aircraft seen later in the evening between 11:08 and 11:15 and in particular ships with the low cruising speeds?
2. Did the Harrisburg Airport land two planes between 11:08 and 11:30 which came in from the East?
3. If your search radar was in operation did it pick up these objects?

If the first two questions are negative my own conclusions would eliminate the possibility of these planes because of the severe locall storms and the lateness of the hour.

If your search did not pick them up and you picked them up and received no answer on interrogation it would further confirm the presence of some definite objects of abnormal character.
