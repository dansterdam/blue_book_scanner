6. DISCUSSION (Cont.):
As I have previously informed the subjects of my interview, when people come to me with subjects of this kind, I usually refer them to the Air Force for official action. They have immediate access to the official channels and have facilities at their disposal which I do not possess. In this particular case, however, I was informed that the sighting had been reported to the Air Force and that no satisfactory explanation had been obtained. For this reason, and also because Mr. Angell-to whose courtesy I am indebted - was desirous that I should make a further inquiry into the matter, I agreed to do so.
The incident occurred on the night of June 23, 1956, at approximately 2000 hours Eastern Daylight Saving Time, 8 miles south of Cincinnati, Ohio. The weather was clear, with visibility estimated at 10 to 15 miles. The object or objects observed were white in color, and moved in a horizontal path across the sky in a northerly direction, at an estimated elevation of 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon. The object or objects appeared to be luminous, and traveled at an estimated speed of 1000 to 1200 miles per hour. The sighting lasted for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
12. All witnesses reaffirmed the procurement of the specimens and other documentary evidence retained by the investigator.
13. It is understood did not engage in, nor forced into, any discussions on the Air Force position or approach to the UFO controversy which could be used to the detriment of the Air Force of ATIC.
4. RECOMMENDATIONS:
14. None. Return of the "analysis and identity" of the specimens will dictate the action necessary.
