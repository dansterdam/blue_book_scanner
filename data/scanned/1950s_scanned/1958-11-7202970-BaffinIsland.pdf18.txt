About a year or so ago we had a similar unidentified flying object overfly our neighborhood near my home. It was seen by myself and several neighbors. The object was metallic in appearance and rather saucer-shaped, and seemed to hover and maneuver silently.

33. When and where did you report that you had seen the object?
We decided not to report the previous sighting as we were uncertain as to what we had actually observed.
