UFO Sightings, 7 February 1955 
SAFOR-34 (Major Packard)
1. The assistant Chief of staff, intelligence, recently forwarded these two reports to the Air Force. However, they do not reveal an attitude which would be of value to the Air Force. 
2. Throughout the tape, it indicates that the United States Government, and specifically the Air Force, is responsible for the lack of seriousness with which UFO sightings are regarded. It suggests that some action is taken by the Air Force for a "look see" in an UFO sighting which he reported 7 February 1955, in California. December 1955, it * reported a request for a visit from an Air Force team to make a physical survey to verify the information. 
3. The case reported to the Air Force on 7 February 1955, it was apparently an experimental aircraft. The physical characteristics found in the AFC case files. Considerable time was spent in investigation, and in view of a lack of additional information, and in view of a lack of additional information, AFO has no reason to change this original evaluation, in view of no new evidence. Holds firm.
