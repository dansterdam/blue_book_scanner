Text from the document:

Dear Mr. ----

Your letter of September 6th addressed to the White House has been referred to this office.

Your interest in this matter manifested by writing to tell us of your sighting of the object was appreciated. Your description of how the object was propelled and the complete lack of noise or evidence of any propulsion to be observed specifically or a sound like or fury, which was widely reported by other witnesses who claimed to have seen the same object, suggests that our speculation as to the nature of these phenomena may be incorrect. 

Do you have any additional information which may be helpful in our continuing study of this unusual incident? If so, we would be glad to have it. Also, do you identify and provide a physical description of the observed object and its manner of flight, and the duration of time it was under observation?

We find your report extremely interesting and should be glad to have any further details which may throw light on the nature of the phenomenon you observed. Have you had any other unexplained sightings of phenomena similar to the one you have described? Such reports would be of great value to us.

Thank you for taking the time to write to us on this matter.

Sincerely,

WILLIAM G. COMAN, JR.
MAJOR, USAF
