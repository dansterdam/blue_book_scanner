On 2 July 1953, I saw one object. It was round as a balloon or a cigar. As it was about 1,000 to 1,500 feet up, it could be seen clearly. It would be about 40 feet long. It did not seem to be anything we could recognize. It seemed to stand still, but it moved a little. It did not seem to be anything known to us. It moved up, it moved down, but it did not seem to go straight up, as it did not fly very high. If it had been a balloon, it would have gone straight up. 

I saw this object between 1930 and 1940. I stood to the side and observed it for 10 or 15 minutes. It seemed to be 1,000 to 1,500 feet up. It did not seem to move very fast. It would come to a stop and then move on again. It seemed to cover from 1/4 to 1/2 mile while I observed it. It would come back to practically the same spot, as if it would come back to the same place.

I observed this object through binoculars for 7-850 from the ground. The object was about 5Â° 3' from directly overhead (higher air force base). 

I have had quite a bit of experience observing aircraft in the air. I was in the army for 4 (4) years and I was a pilot for 3 years. This was not anything known to me nor anything I have ever seen before. 

The weather was clear. There was a blue sky background.
The object was 40,000 to 50,000 feet high.
