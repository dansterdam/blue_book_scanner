SLIDE NO. 14

This shows the sort of people, within certain limits, from 
whom these reports of sightings come. You'll note the preponder-
ance of civilian observers, concerning whom we have attempted 
no separation or classification. As to military observers, 
however, we did think it might be useful to classify them as 
you see here (ad lib from chart on different classifications)

SLIDE NO. 15

This slide shows reported shapes of objects. We had hoped to 
narrow down a little this matter of shapes, and learn something of 
real significance. But, as you see from the chart, this effort has 
so far not been very productive. Considering viewing angles, times 
of day, condition of darkness, weather, all the other factors that 
are involved, it is extremely difficult to establish any sort of 
pattern as to shape.
