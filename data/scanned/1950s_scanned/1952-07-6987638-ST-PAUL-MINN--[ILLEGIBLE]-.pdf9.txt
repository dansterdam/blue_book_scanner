DESCRIPTIONS:
Two bright objects of light were seen, about as bright as Jupiter's (about 1). They appeared to be about the size of a star, possibly a little larger. They remained stationary and seemed to exhibit no discernible motion, except for having a slight flickering or pulsing of the light constant in color (reddish-white) and intensity at all positions.
First Objects: Observed what appeared to be two exhaust flames about the size of a match head.
Maneuvers and Speeds:
First Objects: Appeared in the South, moved almost overhead about one o'clock in about 20 to 25 seconds and held this altitude.
Second Objects: It was in view from SE to SW for about twenty seconds.
Sounds:
Both were silent, although we heard a faint distant sound for about two seconds, like a jet or perhaps a diesel locomotive, during the second sighting. The duration of sightings:
First Object - About 28/2330 CST
Second Object - About 30/2300 CST
Duration of sightings: About 30 seconds each time.
Manner of observation:
First Objects: It was visible through the telescope for a couple of seconds before it passed out of sight. The time of flight coincided with our time of sight.
Second Objects: Usually, by naked eye and also by telescope. Occasional intervals of about 1 to 2 minutes, until sightings faded from view.
Location of Observers: St. Paul, Minnesota.
