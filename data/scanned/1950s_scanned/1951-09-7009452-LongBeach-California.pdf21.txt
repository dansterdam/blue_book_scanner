SUBJECT: High Flying Unidentified Object

1. Reference is made to AF Form 112, Fi, dated 5 Oct 1951, subject: Unidentified object sighted over Muroc Air Force Base on 23 Sept 1951.

2. The possibility of this object being a weather balloon is considered, but it is not felt that this is a satisfactory explanation if the object was a balloon, and it was not an experimental aircraft.

3. It is requested that the following information be obtained from the Guided Missiles Research and Development Center, ATTN: ATIN-20, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio:

a. From what location was the original sighting of the object made? How was it located over long periods?

b. From what base did the F-86's take off? What was the time of take-off?

c. The report states that the object was first sighted by the F-86's over Muroc. What was the time and location of the first sighting at the scene?

d. The report states that when the F-86's reached an altitude of 43,000 feet, the object was already in sight during its run from Muroc to March Air Force Base. Did the F-86's have the object in sight during its entire run?
