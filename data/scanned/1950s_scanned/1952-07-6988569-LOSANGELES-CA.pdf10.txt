SECOND LIEUTENANT JOHN L. SPAULDING, INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
MIDDLETOWN, PENNSYLVANIA

DEAR LIEUTENANT SPAULDING:

I HAVE FORWARDED A COPY OF YOUR REPORT TO THE AIR FORCE, AS REQUESTED IN YOUR LETTER.

ON THE FOLLOWING POINTS YOU WILL FIND MY COMMENTS AND OPINION ON SUCH MATTERS AS YOU HAVE DISCUSSED: 

PERSONALLY I FEEL THAT MANY REPORTED INCIDENTS CAN BE EASILY EXPLAINED AND THAT IDENTIFICATIONS CAN BE MADE IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES. THE FACT REMAINS, HOWEVER, THAT SOME OBSERVATIONS AND INCIDENTS CANNOT BE READILY OR CONCLUSIVELY EXPLAINED BY NORMAL MEANS, AND I AM CERTAIN THAT YOU WILL AGREE THAT THESE MERIT ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION WHERE POSSIBLE. YOUR OBSERVATIONS APPEAR TO BE OF SUCH A NATURE.

SOME ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS OR INTERROGATIONS OF WITNESSES HAVE BEEN MADE IN SIMILAR CASES, AND IT IS HOPED THAT YOU MAY JUDGE THEREBY THE PROBABLE ACCURACY OF YOUR REPORT.

MY OWN CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT THE OBJECTS SIGHTED WERE DEFINITELY NOT REFLECTED LIGHT OR MIRAGES. THEY WERE FURTHER MORE NOT REFLECTIONS ON THE GLASS WINDOWS OF THE CAR IN WHICH I WAS TRAVELLING. 

THEY WERE TOO BRIGHT FOR IDENTIFICATION LIGHTS ON PLANES.

SHOULD FURTHER INFORMATION BE DESIRED I CAN BE REACHED AT YORK.

I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE A REPLY AS TO YOUR FINDINGS IN THE MATTER.

VERY TRULY YOURS,
