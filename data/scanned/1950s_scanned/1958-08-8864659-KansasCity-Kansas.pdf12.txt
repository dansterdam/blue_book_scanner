17 September 1958

Dear Mr. [redacted]

Your letter of 23 August 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object was referred to the Air Technical Intelligence Center for evaluation.

As you know, a thorough check of the circumstances surrounding this sighting was made by qualified investigators.

The evaluation revealed that several Air Force planes were in the area at the time of the sighting. These planes had completed training missions and were returning to their home stations. The pilots of these planes reported seeing a bright light which appeared to be moving faster than the planes. However, this light was determined to be the reflection of the sun's rays on the windows of the other aircraft as they were turning to head toward their home stations.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Deputy Assistant Executive Officer
