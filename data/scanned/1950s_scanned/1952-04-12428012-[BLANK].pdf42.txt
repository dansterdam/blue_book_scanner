It was realized early that a special effort would have to be
made by the Air Force to deal with the situation into which we had
been plunged with such abruptness. Accordingly, the Intelligence
Department of the Air Materiel Command -- from which the Air Technical
Intelligence Center has since evolved -- set up a special project to
handle the investigation. I should like to emphasize here that this
investigation was undertaken without bias and in all seriousness. It
was not "slanted", that is to say. Its object was not to either prove
or disprove the existence of the phenomena, but rather to learn the
truth of the matter. And, of course, if the truth were learned, to
determine whether any possible hazard to the United States was involved.

It is perhaps worthy of note here that a particular effort was
made to enlist the services of not only military and civilian
mental agencies, but also of civilian scientists and "disinterested"
authorities. The consulting authorities were as follows:

1. Dr. J. A. Hynek, an astronomer of Ohio State University.
2. The Air Weather Service.
