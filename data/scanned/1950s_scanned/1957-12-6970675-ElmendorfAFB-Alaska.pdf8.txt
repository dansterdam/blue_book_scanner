13 December 1957
Belleville, Illinois

Friday morning, December 6, 1957 (yesterday) at around 8:00 A.M. a strange light was seen over Belleville, Illinois. About 5 miles southeast is located what is known as Scott Air Base (Army Training Base). The time that I had the pleasure of seeing "object" in question, it was very stationary over Collinsville, Illinois, which city is located about 5 miles North of Belleville. 
At this time, the sun shown so clear that the "object" (assumed) that it appeared as an intense SILVER light. It appeared to you would hold a silver dollar at arm's length and its bottom side was showing. Our Government reported this as a weather balloon.
