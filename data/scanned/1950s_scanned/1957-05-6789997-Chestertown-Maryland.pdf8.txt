In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could 
construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape 
would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the 
same appearance as the object which you saw.
I saw no actual form of an object but there were things;
or floating lights arranged in an arch with two red 
lights at either end. It resembled an arch chandelier 
that floated. Note there were not any clear lines 
of the form to which the lights might have been
attached.
