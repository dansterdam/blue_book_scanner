There is no photograph on this page of the document. The image appears to be a diagram or illustration depicting a spherical projection with various angular measurements and reference directions (such as East, West, North, South). The dome-like structure is marked with degrees, while the horizon line includes compass points and angular measurements. There are handwritten annotations on the diagram.

Below, I will produce the OCR output of the text found in the diagram:
