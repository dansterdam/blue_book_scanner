Text from the document:

On the night of 25 August 1952, at my home at 2159 hours, I observed a meteor-like object in the direction of Kirtland Air Force Base. The speed of the aircraft might have been 550 miles per hour.

The aircraft was low enough for the neon and car lights of East Central Avenue to be reflected from it. The altitude of the aircraft was estimated to be 10,000 feet.

The size of the aircraft was apparently 1 1/2 to 2 times of that of a B-36.

The type of the aircraft was that of a one with wings swept back 15Â° approximately. He fuselage was visible. The wings did not appear to taper as to the rear edge. On the rear side of each of the wings at least 5 and possible 6 soft, white lights were visible. These lights were approximately 10 in. diameter and between 2 to 3 feet apart. These lights were steady and not blinking. They were a little less bright than between each one in a pair. No red or green lights were visible.

The underneath surface of the wings of the aircraft appeared to have stripes running parallel to the leading edge to the rear edge of the wings between the lights. The space between the stripe and the lights appeared to be lighted.

The most outstanding feature of this observation was the fact that there was no audible sound from motors or jets. In fact, the aircraft made no noise that I could hear.

The above statement is true to the best of my ability to describe.
