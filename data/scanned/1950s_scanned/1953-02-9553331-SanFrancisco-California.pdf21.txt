Actually, the sky show appeared to be a double feature, as the object seemed to be as large as a house, "winky" before the scientist's eyes and then disappeared. This phenomenon--caused eyes to pop at once--was witnessed by a number of people here.
Some "professional" flying saucers flyers recently have been chasing meteors in the skies, claiming they are from outer space. Emoryviile Policemen James W. Adams and Alto Bortz, driving along a highway near Emoryzille, sighted a strange formation flare in the sky. A patroiman Wayne Van Slyke said he watched it disappear as it went off toward Hayward. He said it seemed to be weaving from side to side as it went.
It appeared to be a light bulb, moving up and down at a terrific speed. At first it seemed to be getting smaller; then it moved up and down several times, going faster and faster. Then it just disappeared. There was no noise, said the patrolman.
Officer Karl G gave almost precise description of what Robert Gornann saw in sky earlier. Many people here believe these things to be flying saucers from another world. But Gornann insists they can be explained by some other means, and are not SPACESHIPS.
Still the reports of night-time phenomena continue. People claim they see objects that appear and disappear in the sky. But if these are not space ships from another world, what can they be?
