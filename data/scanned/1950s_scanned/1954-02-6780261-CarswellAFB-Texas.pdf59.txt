The image does not contain a photograph; instead, it shows a hand-drawn diagram. The diagram seems to represent a top view of circular bands labeled with numbers 5 through 35 at intervals, possibly indicating distance or elevation levels. A dashed line extends from the south to the approximate center, where there’s an indication of direction and possibly a pivotal point labeled "W" and "E". Some scribbled lines and X marks appear, possibly indicating movement or specific observations related to the diagram.
