Motion & general description conform to often reported characteristics of Unidentified Flying Objects. The object was hovering and changing color, indicating that it may have some advanced propulsion. Its high speed departure also indicates advanced performance characteristics. It seems to be technically far in advance of known aircraft. This case is considered interesting and further evaluation is suggested.
