SUBJECT: Letter of Commendation

TO: Commanding Officer
Mitchell Air Force Base
New York

The Air Technical Intelligence Center wishes to commend two officers over one organization, Ledge Grogan and Carubia Lytzen, both of Base Operations, for the excellent and thorough manner in which they investigated a report of an unidentified flying object which originated with your organization on 1 November 1952. This investigation disclosed new and additional information heretofore not known to this Headquarters, and made available significant data.

Airway, Newark Airport, and Investigator Airport, having obtained this information, have given active cooperation and have furnished additional charts in order to assist in arriving at a solution to the cause of this incident. Their thoroughness and their willingness to cooperate in this investigation, and their imaginative approach to a logical conclusion are highly commendable.

V. M. GARTEN
Commanding
