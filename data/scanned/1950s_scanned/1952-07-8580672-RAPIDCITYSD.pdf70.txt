Transcribing the text from the document:

Subject: The discovery and preliminary investigation of a stone-like object, which appears to be from the air.

If the Air Force should consider that some publicity of this subject matter would be desirable, it is suggested that the announcement be brief, and it is requested that no more than that be mentioned in the announcement. It is desired that I be designated as the Naval officer on duty in Washington, D.C.

The Navy Bureau of Aeronautics has assigned two officers to conduct this investigation. The consensus of their opinion is that the armed forces should properly be within the province of the Air Force.
