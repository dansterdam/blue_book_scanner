Report to be filed under Case #9

Date: August 7, 1952
Time: Evening
Location: Vienna, Virginia
Observers: Mr. X and Mr. Y

Narrative:
At approximately 6:30 pm on the evening of August 7, 1952, Mr. X and Mr. Y were driving along Route 123 near Vienna, Virginia when they observed a bright, disc-shaped object hovering over a wooded area to the south of their vehicle. The object appeared to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter and was emitting a faint, pulsating glow. 

After watching the object for several minutes, it suddenly accelerated at tremendous speed and disappeared from view. Mr. X and Mr. Y immediately pulled over to the side of the road and contacted the local police to report the sighting. An investigation was launched, but no further evidence of the object could be located.

This incident has been classified as a "unidentified flying object" (UFO) in Project Blue Book records. No definitive explanation for the sighting has been determined.
