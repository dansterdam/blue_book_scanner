The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten page from an old UFO report document.

Total observe it. I hope that this information can be of some help. Definitely believe it was no plane or any object we were observed before. When it stopped I came into the house to call, it actually stood still 2 or 3 minutes. about as it were above a very slight wispy cloud came to light, seemed to reflect on cloud, then it moved to the east again, got dim and then bright again, but not as bright as when directly overhead. It disappeared with a slight pause.
