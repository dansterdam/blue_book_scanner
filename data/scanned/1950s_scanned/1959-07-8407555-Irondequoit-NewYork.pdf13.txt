Color remained a brownish black and the object was described as the size of a basketball when nearest the observer. It exhibited no sound and no trail. His impression was that it was a solid metallic object, possibly elliptical in shape. He felt it was definitely not an aircraft or anything he had seen before. He could not estimate its altitude or speed from the brief observation but it appeared to be traveling at a moderate speed. The object was observed for about 8-10 seconds before it went out of sight. The informant said he has seen numerous aircraft and this did not resemble any of them. He felt it merited investigation by proper authorities. He does not recall seeing the object in the sky again.
