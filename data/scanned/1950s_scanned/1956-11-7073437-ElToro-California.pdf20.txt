Travel 9.5 STATEMENT OF CGA OUTSIDE OBSERVER STATEMENT:
Around 2100: I noticed Sgt Word and W/Sgt Karawalw, looking towards the North a a red light, which I never saw. We then turned on the scope and picked up a target about five miles north. It moved very slowly in a north-easterly direction. This is all I saw. The rest of the morning I was outside observer for Sgt Word.
