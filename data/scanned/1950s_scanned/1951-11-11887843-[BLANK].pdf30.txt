1. Background

In accordance with instructions contained in a classified letter from Chief of Staff, USAF to CG, ADC, subject "Light Phenomena", on 14 September 1949, Lt. Col. Frederic C.E. Oder of GHQ attended a conference at Los Alamos, 14 October 1949 on the subject of "Green Fireballs" observed in the Northern New Mexico area. Since the phenomena had been observed only in this area and only since 1947, it had caused considerable concern among security agencies in the area. It was the conclusion of the scientists present at this meeting that the information available was not sufficiently conclusive. Instrumental observations - photographic, triangulation, and spectrographic were considered essential.

Dr. J. L. La Paz of the Department of Univ. of New Mexico was present at the Los Alamos meeting and subsequently was invited to submit proposals for studying this phenomenon under GHQ sponsorship. On 2 February 1950, Dr. La Paz advised that due to difficulties with academic arrangements, he was unable to undertake this study.

During February 1950, the frequent reports of unexplained serial phenomena in the vicinity of Holloman Air Force Base and Vaughn, New Mexico prompted the Commanding Officer of Holloman Air Force Base to initiate a program to gather factual data.
