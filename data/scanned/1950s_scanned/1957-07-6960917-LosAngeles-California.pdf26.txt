COMMENTS
A detachment of L-5 radar. operators manning a radar unit at an Air Defense location. were the observers. Objects were seen at intervals through the radar scope, but radar equipment failed to pick up definite returns, probably due to characteristics of the objects which were seen visually. Observation was probably caused by balloons.
