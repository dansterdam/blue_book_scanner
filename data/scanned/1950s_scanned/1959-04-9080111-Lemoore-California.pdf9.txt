The Honorable James H. Douglas, Secretary of the U. S. Air Force Washington 25, D. C.
Dear Mr. Secretary:
Congratulations! If these unconventional flying vehicles, I observed recently, are a part of your Air Force, you are certainly to be complimented.
My observations, supported by those of three others here, indicated that these performances are most amazing and astounding. If they, truly, are not a part of your Air Force, God help us! Certainly, you must be interested in what is going on in our air space; and on these three occasions here mentioned, we observed the performances of these ships far exceeding anything we had ever seen before. What is the evaluation of these ships' performance and missions? If so, please advise the procedure for a similar to proceed.
Myself and three other responsible observers, in this vicinity of the day, the performances of three of these extraordinary unconventional flying devices, with the use of binoculars which left nothing to the imagination... would appreciate an early reply as to whether these unconventional flying objects are a part of your Air Force. If not, what are you doing about it?
Most respectfully yours,
[Signature Redacted] Vice President
