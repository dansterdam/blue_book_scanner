DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO.
SUBJECT: UFO Report
FROM: AFOIN-4A2F
TO: AFOIN-4A2F
DATE: 4 Feb 58
COMMENT NO.: 1
1. Photographs attached to UFO report from 84th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron have been examined and the following analysis made from a photographic standpoint:
a. Object photographed was a stationary light of some type and could be an exposure of 1/10 to 1/2 second or a moon or star as it does not likely become an object or an exposure of 45 seconds, there would be subject movement resulting in a streak.
b. There is no similarity between the one print and the other 3 which are the same and it is doubtful that they are of the same object.
2. Any further photographic analysis of these photos would require negative and information on camera used, etc.
