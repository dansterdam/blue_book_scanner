On 17 June 1954, this office was advised by Major RUSSEL F. HOSELEY, 002900A, Eglin AFB, Florida. that at 2230 hours, 17 June 1954, a jet pilot of the 10th Fighter Bomber Squadron, JINGOLSKI, altitude 32,000 feet, observed a bright unidentified object over the same area, Indialantic, Florida. HOSELEY called to inform him from Base Operations to witness the object. These two (2) sightings were, in the opinion of HOSELEY, positively the same object. JINGOISKJ was scrambled, but the object had disappeared. JINGOISKI was the pilot and DONALD S. DUNCAN, Asst. 19808th Air Base Group, Patrick AFB, Florida, was the observer. 
The object was described as bright and shiny reflecting the sun. It appeared to be circular in shape, with a definite outline and no apparent aerodynamic features. No exhaust or trail was observed. The object was first sighted at an altitude of 35,000 to 40,000 feet and descended rapidly to an altitude of 32,000 feet during the course of its movement and appeared to veer right and left as it moved. The color of the object was blue, fluorescent in nature, changing intermittently to white. No discernible features were observed and the object was completely silent in operation. The shape remained constant throughout the observation.
The elapsed time of the observation was approximately 30 seconds. The object disappeared from view to the northwest direction after the jet pilot broke off directly west of Patrick AFB. The object was observed by ground coverage to ants for 3613 hours, EST, 17 June 1954. The object appeared to be several times larger than the jet aircraft and was visible in the sky also. Occasionally, when the light blinked and became brighter, it appeared that the object might be rotating or changing its aspect on the sun.
