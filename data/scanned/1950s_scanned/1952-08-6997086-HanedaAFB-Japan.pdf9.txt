The first time I noticed the intense bright light over the Bay, was while crossing the ramp on our way to the tower. At first we thought it was an air-craft with landing lights on, but as we kept watching we noticed it wasn’t mov-ing. When we were about half way across the ramp it disappeared for the first time and returned to approximately the same spot about 15 seconds later.

After we got in the tower I started looking at it with binoculars, which made the object much clearer. Around the bright white light in the middle, there was a darker object which stood out against the sky, having little white lights along the outer edge, and a glare around the whole thing.

I watched it disappear twice through the glasses. It seemed to travel to the East and gaining altitude at a very fast speed, much faster than any jet. Every time it disappeared it returned again, except for the last time when the jets were around. It seemed to know they were there.

As for an estimate on the size of the object— I couldn’t even guess.

I know it wasn’t a star, weather balloons or Venus, because I compared it with all three.

When we first saw it, we estimated it to be at about 5,000 feet. We couldn’t estimate the distance because of the angle we were looking at it and the brightness.. It was to the NNE of the field.

I watched it from 11:30 to 12:30, it was very clear in the east until then. The bright light disappeared again at about 12:30 and we lost sight of it due to the broken clouds that moved in at that time. We kept looking for it whenever the clouds broke, but we never saw it again.
