Gentlemen:

We would like to report the sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object on 1 December 1958 at approximately 16:37 hours.

The object when first sighted seemed to be a jet trail inasmuch as it was white in color and had considerable shape when first sighted. It was inclined approximately 60° with the horizon. It then changed to a level position. A few moments later it seemed to burn and formed a level position (until it became a small white brilliant dot). Then without any other apparent motion it vanished. The object was under observation for about two minutes.

Our position of observation was:
Latitude 40° 25' 25"
Longitude 74° 13' 57"

Approximate altitude of sighting was 30°, approximate bearing was 230° True. Sighting observers above mean sea level was approximately 45'. Apparent distance of the object was five miles. Naturally we cannot be certain of this since this distance was in natural unknown. Observer position and bearing to object was determined from Compass. Date No. 342.

Observers were:
Mr. [redacted], Westfield, N.J.
Mr. [redacted], Matawan, N.J.
Mr. [redacted], Matawan, N.J.

All three observers are engineers employed by the Industrial Washing Machine Corp. Located in Matawan which location the UFO was sighted. It would be appreciated if the information contained in this letter could be kept confidential.

Please do not hesitate contacting us if you require any further information.
A sketch showing the shape and maneuvering of the UFO is enclosed.

Very truly yours,
