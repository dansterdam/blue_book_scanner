Aripbane, May 18:
A meteorological officer, while plotting the course of a balloon with a theodolite, sighted a bright crescent shaped object in the morning sky. It appeared to be moving in a southerly direction. It was observed for about 15 minutes and with the naked eye. It gave the observers the impression that it was suspended in space and reflecting the early morning sunlight.
