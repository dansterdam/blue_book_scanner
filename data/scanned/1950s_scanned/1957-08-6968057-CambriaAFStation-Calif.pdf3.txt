DE FIELDS
MEDICINE: Cortisone-like Drugs 
Stop Childbirth Killings

PSYCHIATRY: General Hospitals 
More Mental Patients

BIOLOGY: Chickens' Double Egg Production

INDUSTRY: Radioisotopes Help Weigh Red-Hot Slags

THREE BRITISH scientists have succeeded in deducing a powerful new law of isotopic chemistry. They found that the absorption of heat energy by complex molecules could be measured indirectly from the ratio of isotopic concentration.

In the psychiatric section, it is mentioned that general hospitals are treating increasing numbers of mental patients, and that about two-thirds of these psychiatric units are in general hospitals rather than mental institutions.

The biology section discusses a study on chickens that found a way to double egg production in chickens, through the development of a technique that triggers the chickens to lay two eggs per ovulation instead of one.

The industry section talks about how radioisotopes are being used to help weigh red-hot slags, which are byproducts from metal smelting.
