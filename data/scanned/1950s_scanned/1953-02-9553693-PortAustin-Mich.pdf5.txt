There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a typed report describing a sighting of an unusual light that changed in color from a bright red to pale white and seemed to move from north to south. The report is signed by John T. Mandinie, a radar operator.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the full text found in the document:

On 17 February 1953, at 2204 EST, while standing guard, I noticed an unusual light almost due west of our station. The object was in a dark of the sky and was visible. The object seemed to glow a bright red, then changed to pale white, and then red again, repeating this change over and over. The movement of this object seemed to be from north to south. After a while the object started getting smaller until I could no longer see it.
