AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

O CAPT., New Delhi, India 2-27760
1. On 14 July 1959, at about 9 P.M., the following was submitted by Office Memorandum under the heading "UNEXPLAINED AERIAL SIGHTING": 
At about 9 P.M. on Tuesday, July 14, 1959, while I was eating dinner at home, I noticed a light moving across the sky. It was considerable brighter and much larger than any star or conventional airplane that I have seen. The light appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and seemed to be very high in the sky. As the light continued on its course, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view very quickly. I have no idea of the size, shape or altitude of the object, but it appeared to be much larger and brighter than any airplane flying at less than 20,000 feet and was traveling at a greater speed than any conventional aircraft that I have observed. I saw no sound, trail, or any other distinguishing features.

2. COMMENTS OF THE REPORTING OFFICER:
The captain's report indicates that at 2020 Indian Standard Time on 14 July 1959, he observed an unidentified light in the sky near New Delhi, which appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed. The light was considerably brighter and larger than any star or conventional aircraft. The object accelerated and disappeared from view quickly. The temperature inversion at the time was between 3,000 and 5,000 feet. The captain is an experienced observer and seems to be reliable. There is no evidence of any conventional aircraft or satellite in the area at the time of the sighting.
