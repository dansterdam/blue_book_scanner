STATEMENT OF
SARALAND, ALABAMA

On 2 August 1952 at 16:30 - 17:30 PM local time, I was sitting in my back yard gazing at the stars when I saw the bright reflection of the sun on the object appear to be about 20 feet in diameter and hovering a few feet above the ground. As the object appeared to be descending slowly to the ground, I became frightened and watched to see what would happen next. The object turned to a dull lead color and made no sound, so I went to the door to point it out to my wife to witness it also. When I returned, the object had disappeared. The time of sighting was less than a minute. By outside appearance it seemed clearly to be some type of aircraft in the area at the time of sighting. I did not see or hear any other aircraft in the area at the time of sighting.
