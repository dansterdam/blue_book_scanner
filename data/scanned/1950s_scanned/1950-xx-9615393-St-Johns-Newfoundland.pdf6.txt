REPORT OF INVESTIGATION

TITLE: Unidential Aircraft
30 JULY 1950, ST. JOHN'S, NFLD.

CHARACTER: Special Inquiry - Unidentical Aircraft 

REFERENCE: AFOSI LTR. 108

SYNOPSIS: Various persons in the vicinity of St. John's, Newfoundland have reported that on 30 July 1950, at approximately 2015 hours, they observed an unidentified aircraft or craft of some kind maneuvering in the sky over this area. Detailed descriptions of the object were varied and for the most part could not be reconciled. Estimates of size, shape, and speed varied widely but the general consensus of opinion was that the aircraft did not attain any extraordinary speed while in flight and may have struck ground or reported in the vicinity of Pepperrell Air Force Base.

DETAILS:
This is a joint investigation of RCAF Newfoundland and USAF.

Mr. [...] of Kings Road, St. John's, Newfoundland was interviewed and stated that approximately 2015 hours, 30 July 1950, while sitting on the top of the hill in his backyard, he observed a strange object in the sky near the town of St. John's. He described it as round in shape, about the size of a house, and giving off a brilliant light. It was moving fast and trailing a brilliant stream of blue-green fire for about two or three feet in diameter. It was visible for approximately 10 seconds.
