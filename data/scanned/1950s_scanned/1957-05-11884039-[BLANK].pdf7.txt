(2) ADC directly participating only when a UFO sighting is considered a hostile air vehicle; however, ADC will continue to render investigation as required.
(3) More extensive follow-up investigation, when considered necessary, to be accomplished by the 1006th AISS.
The above realignment of responsibilities should effect more economical utilization of the 1006th AISS and provide for more timely UFO reporting since local AF base Commanders can investigate on the spot.
G. The responsibility for release of UFO information to the public and Congress is assigned to SAFIS; however, ATIC may conduct follow-up investigations as necessary to further its findings.
Coordination on UFO matters between AFCIN and AFCIN-4 described in paragraph 4d above will be few such occurrences, as a result of ATIC's policy to SOI LLUFON relations.
As previously stated, AFCIN is now completely divorced from public relations on UFO matters. AFCIN will depend on SAFIS to handle and press relations.
In addition, the following significant developments are brought to your attention: 
1. The UFO Scientific Panel Report conclusions of 1953, sponsored by CIA, were declassified for public knowledge. It was necessary for CIA to contact each of the panel members to accomplish the declassification.
