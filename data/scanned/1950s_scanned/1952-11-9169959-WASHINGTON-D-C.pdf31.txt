COMMENT NO: 1
1. Mrs. - sighting was evaluated as "possible balloon."
2. This is a U.S. Weather Bureau launching site in Sacramento which possibly launched a balloon November 15, 1952 just prior to his sighting.
3. Mr. -------- reports an 8 to 10 foot sighting in Los Angeles. He states this object was a silver sphere about the size of a basketball, and was at an attitude of five or six inches, in which case it would have been sitting on his head. The object remained motionless for about five minutes. It was described as the same size of a night football. It must not have frightened him because it wasn't reported until the latter part of 1954.
