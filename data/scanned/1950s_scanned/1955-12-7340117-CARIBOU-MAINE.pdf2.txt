The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text on a document titled "U.S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET (SUMMARY DATA)".

As per your request, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

To answer the 10 - The sighted object was similar to the sun. It was about 1/3 the size of the sun, and was brighten than the sun. It seemed to be at a great altitude, traveling very rapidly. It appeared stationary for a few seconds, then suddenly burst into tremendous speed and disappeared from sight. I never seen anything like it before. The object was observed for about 10-15 seconds by myself and my wife. I estimated its altitude to be about 10,000-20,000 feet. The object seemed to be round or elliptical in shape, and was a brilliant white or silvery in color. And between the flash which momentary blinded me, I could not detect any fins, wings or other projections from the object. I have no idea what this object could have been. It certainly didn't seem to be any type of conventional aircraft that I am familiar with. I would be interested in your comments on this sighting, and if you care to have more details, I shall be glad to furnish them. I hope this report is of some value to your investigation.
