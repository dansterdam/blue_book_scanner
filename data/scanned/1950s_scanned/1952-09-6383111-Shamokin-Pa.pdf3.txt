The Thing, 10 Feet Tall, Terrifies Party of 7

Sutton, W. Va., Sept. 14 (UP)—A housewife swore today that she and six boys saw “an evil-smelling fire-breathing monster, 10 feet tall, with a bright green body and blood-red face,” on a hillside near here.

Mrs. Kathleen May of Flatwood, her four children Freddy of eleven included, and six from her experiments said she and the boys, (including, 17-year-old National Guardsman, investigating Friday night who made the first reports) that a flying saucer had landed. She said she, her sons Gene, 13, and Fred, 12, and Neil Nunley, 14, Ronnie Shaver, 10, and Tommy Hyer, also 10, all went to the hill here Friday night.

Persons who were smothering unaware said the hiding move in a tree, and when the lone flashlight on it was shone aimed at the tree, he saw the 10-foot "thing" with the flushed face and icy green body that “seemed to glow.”

Mrs. May and Tom Lemon were the interior and fall backward as the monster dawalked toward them and the whole party turned and ran. She said the monster exuded an overpowering odor that so sickened them they vomited for hours afterward.
