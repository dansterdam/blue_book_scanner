1. The following amounts are suggested:
a. The question may be asked bluntly:
Just what is it that the people actually observed?
b. Although helpful and of course we want to know the names and addresses of witnesses, we do not want to emphasize this - the observation comes first.
c. Might the actual sighting be remembered in greater detail by a second interview with the witness?
d. Were any sound or noise associated with it observed that might give clue as to the nature of the sighting?
e. If true, this would give additional detail and possibly indicate nature of object. However, we do not want to suggest this, but let the witness report this if it is a fact.
f. If more information is deemed necessary, suggest follow up interview - but let the report indicate any additional detail without leading the witness.
