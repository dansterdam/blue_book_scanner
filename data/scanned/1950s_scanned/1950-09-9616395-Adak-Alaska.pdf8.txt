1. The attached photographs have been examined and the probable explanation has been determined. A 4” x 5” Speed Graphic camera with coated lens was pointed toward the sun, and the image was examined on the ground glass. A pronounced flare spot, in addition to the main image, was noted with the lens wide open, f/4.7. Any camera movement caused the flare spot to move, as well as the main image. Inserting a flat glass filter before the lens in the conventional position produced additional flare spots, which moved about with slight variations in filter orientation.

2. Flare images are always encountered in photography when an unusually bright object is included in the field of view, and when the exposure is not proportionally reduced. The stated exposure is considerably in excess of normal for an object as bright as the sun, as shown also by considerable halation of the negatives about the sun images.

3. It is probable that the spots in question are nothing more than flare spots due to overexposure for sun brightness.
