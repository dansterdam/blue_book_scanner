The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a project blue book document that describes sightings of various types of aircraft and missiles, with a focus on the similarity of an object sighted to a Douglas Nike Ajax missile. The text in the document has been provided, and I have transcribed it as an OCR system:
