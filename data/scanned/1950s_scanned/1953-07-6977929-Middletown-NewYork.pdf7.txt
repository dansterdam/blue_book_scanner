As at initial investigation it appears to be an item related to a sighting of a light or lights. The very peculiar feature of this flame is the remarkably strange, unusual movement and behavior of the same. As a matter of fact, the flame appeared to have been a living thing of itself, and almost appear to have been a "self-propelled" kind of light. It moved about in rather erratic fashion, not at all like the normal behavior of a flame as we know it.

A very peculiar occurence which we could not very well explain, as there were several of us viewing the same phenomena, and it did not appear to conform at all to any normal behavior of a fire, or flame, as we generally understand it. It has been another I have ever seen the like of, and may prove to be a very unique type of lighting effect, the reasons for which we do not fully understand as yet.

Some additional notes.
