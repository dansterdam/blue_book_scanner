Summary of Information
PLACE: Chickasaw, Alabama
SUBJECT: Unidentified flying objects were sighted near Petty's, Alabama. 
DETAILS: On July 24, 1952, two unidentified objects were sighted approximately 2,200 feet above the ground over the Petty's area near Chickasaw, Alabama. The objects were round and dark in color and appeared to be metallic. Their size was estimated to be about 20 feet in diameter. There were no definite characteristics of being able to determine size or shapes due to darkness and distance, however, the objects appeared to be rotating as they hovered over the horizon. Two bright lights, one on each object, were observed.
The objects were observed for a period of about 15 to 20 minutes. When their lights were turned out, the objects disappeared when their lights were suddenly extinguished as if with a switch.
One of the military officers who observed the objects stated that they could not be identified or observed by any aircraft flying in the area.
The weather report for the period is as follows: Sky clear, wind 5 mph, temperature 80Â°F. Visibility 15 miles.
These objects were not identified or observed by any aircraft flying in the area.
