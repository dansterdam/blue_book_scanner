AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
APPROVED 1 JUNE 1948
SUBJECT: One oval object, described as being very bright, smooth, highly polished silver in color with a definite blue-green surrounding it. It was observed from O'Hare Int'l Airport. Size estimated to be 25 - 30 minutes of arc. Object seemed to disrupt radio lights and appear to make "like shutting off a light" disappearance.
Two scientists consulted at Adler Planetarium, Chicago stated that object could not have been caused by temperature inversion.
