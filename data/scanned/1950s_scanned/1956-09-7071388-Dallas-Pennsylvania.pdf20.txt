While the object was one-quarter of the way across the sky, it appeared to be behind the trees and at that time started to move downward, appearing to go down behind the trees. As it was going down, the last thing I saw was a sharp blue-white light on the bottom of the object. It couldn't have been for more than a few seconds in this projection, beam. It couldn't have been for more than a few seconds in this projection, beam. If it had been longer I think I would have seen it again. The time we left the movie there was a car stopping on the highway, all in a great hurry, people got out and were apparently watching something in the sky. Their size were that of a pencil length, at arms length, and their movements were nervous and quick. Perhaps they could see a clearly recognizable object which from my position I could not. I cannot reach any definite conclusion as to what I saw, other than that it was not a conventional aircraft, not anything I have ever seen before. I am puzzled and cannot account for what I witnessed. If you have any comments or suggestions, I would appreciate hearing from you.
