Well, uhunk. In this great land of ours there is plenty for everybody. 
Everyman, someway will find something to eat. And if he can't do any better he can go about developing the spiritual integrity of his soul and really acquire something in a lifetime. I'm not comparing myself to any great general or anything like that; but people who have never tasted defeat, have never been beat down to rise again to beat down again to rise again can never understand the wisdom that is gained from battle, whether it be physical or mental.
In my 40 years I have had enough experiences and some of them are quite hair raising. I suppose there is a good story in everyman's life but I assure you there are a number of good stories in mine.
Getting back to this uh particular Army thing that I was speaking about a few minutes ago, I remember when we first came back from overseas. We had malaria and malaria is one of the damnest things a man can ever be plagued with and I shall suffer some of the effects of malaria for the rest of my days.
