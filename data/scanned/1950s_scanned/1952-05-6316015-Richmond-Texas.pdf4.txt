It was a young girl & her mother - saw the spacecraft at 9:30 p.m. - watched it for 10 minutes. The object was circular 40 or 50 feet across. [redacted]. The nights of 5/15/52 - other phenomenon. A brilliant light, a disc shaped object. All of these manifestations in the direct line northward - visual evidence - no physical trace at all of any nature - phenomena over a period of years. By the 7th do not still exist but many reports still go into district office - inconclusively. All these cases show there is something present over & above the usual planes. May interest the saucer group as they are all bona fide reports - not hoax or hallucination cases. The description of the object would tally with most reports. Daylight sightings should get more attention.
