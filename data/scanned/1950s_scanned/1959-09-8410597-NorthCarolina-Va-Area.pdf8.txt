Dear Mr. _______,

This is in further response to your letter of August 3, 1960, in which you report the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

We wish to thank you for your interest in submitting the description contained in your letter. As you may know, a number of similar observations have been reported for which there is no particularly satisfactory explanation. This office has facilities designed to investigate such occurrences. We have, therefore, forwarded your letter to the Air Force which has the primary responsibility for investigating this type of phenomenon.

Very truly yours,

James A. _________, Secretary
