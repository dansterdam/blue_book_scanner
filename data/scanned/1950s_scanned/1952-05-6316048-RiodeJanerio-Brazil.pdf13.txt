The image contains a photograph showing a landscape with a mountain range in the background. In the sky above the mountains, there is a disc-shaped object that appears to be a unidentified flying object (UFO). The image seems to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document related to a UFO sighting reported in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1952.

Dear Lt. Col. Coats:

Reference is made to the photograph of an unidentified flying object taken on 10-8-51 near Rio de Janeira, Brazil.

This object was observed on 10-8-51 at approximately 1300 hours local time. It was seen moving over the Tijuca Mountains near Rio by an employee of the Brazilian Air Force and a number of other citizens. The object was cylindrical in shape, estimated to be about 150 feet in length, and appeared to be moving at high speed.

Attached please find a copy of the photograph showing the object as it appeared. It is hoped that this information may be of value to you in your study of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely yours,
