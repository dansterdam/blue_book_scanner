AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

28 - Did any of the observers have any opinions as to the nature of the target? Yes.

29 - Appearance, Course, Speed of the Objects: Conventional Plane.

The following information was derived from a report written about the unknown object observed on 8 March 1953.

The target approached land; a great deal of radio interference was observed on three different occasions, each for 10 to 15 seconds. The interference caused a display on the radar screen to become erratic and fuzzy, but no plot or track was obtained on the target. After about 2 minutes, the interference stopped. The observers could not see the target and it was apparently below the horizon. It was a jet-plane.

23 MAR 1953: This sighting was received from the ADC Site 305, Fort Lyautey Naval Station, French Morocco.
