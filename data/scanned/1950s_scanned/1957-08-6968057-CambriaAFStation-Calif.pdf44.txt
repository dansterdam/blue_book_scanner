Dear Major Keyhoe:

Your letter of 27 August 1957 addressed to the Senior Public Information Officer at Dover Air Force Base, Dover, Delaware, concerning information related to the crash of an F-94C "Starfire" aircraft near Cambria Air Force Station, California, on 9-10 August 1957, has been referred to this headquarters.

Letter information in the press releases, answers to your inquiries, further information is presently limited to this aircraft accident and has been extracted from certain records. 

On the morning of 16 August 1957, First Lieutenant Robert E. Kelley, U. S. Air Force, was piloting an F-94C "Starfire" aircraft from Moody Air Force Base, Alabama, after their departure and following the clime in connection with a routine training mission. 

When it became doubtful whether safe flight conditions could be maintained, the pilot declared an emergency and was forced to abandon the aircraft. This emergency flight condition arose soon after takeoff. The crash-observation and location of the crash portions of the aircraft wreckage was accomplished on 16 August 1957. No evidence of existence of any unusual phenomenon or unidentified object has been determined and the accident is considered the result of a routine operation.

Later, on 17 August 1957, portions of the aircraft wreckage were located in the vicinity of Cambria Air Force Station, California. No further details or information have been determined since this date.

I trust this letter provides the information you requested concerning this aircraft accident.

Sincerely,

FRANK K. EVEREST, JR.
Brigadier General, USAF
Director of Information Services
