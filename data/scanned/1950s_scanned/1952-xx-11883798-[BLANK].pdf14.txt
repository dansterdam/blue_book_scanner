Colonel Edward H. Porter
It is considered that of the three possible methods outlined above, PROPOSAL II would yield the best results. This proposal leaves the remaining personnel of Project UPS (for Project Unidentified Phenomena Studies) in this Center, but is recommended as it provides both the authoritativeness of a high level spokesman and the technical qualifications (in all scientific fields) for adequate fulfillment of the contractual requirements. It is proposed, if no objections arise, to submit this proposal for consideration.

Sincerely,
JOHN E. CANN
Colonel, USAF
