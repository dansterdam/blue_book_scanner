AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

STATEMENT: 
The following statement is submitted as required by AP Letter 200-5 dated 25 May 1951:

On 19 October 1952, at 6:30 P.M. CST, a witness observed an aerial object which seemed to be moving at a fast rate of speed in the sky over Selma, Alabama. The object was circular in shape and appeared to be about the size of a 50 cent piece held at arm's length. It was observed for about two minutes. At first it seemed to be one solid object, but after a short time it appeared to break up into two parts and the two parts separated, moving away from each other. The witness stated that the object gave off a bright white light and the vapor trail was very visible.
