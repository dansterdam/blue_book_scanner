STATEMENT

From data on flight of five (5) F-86D jet fighters on night of 3 May 1956, it was determined that 3 of the planes reported visual contact with unidentified objects in the air near Boiling AFB Washington, D.C. Further details of the incident as reported this date by Captain Billie J. Elias, USAF, who was the flight leader, are as follows:

The flight was alerted at approximately 0350 hours on 3 May 1956 to investigate the presence of unidentified objects in the air over South Carolina and Virginia. The planes were vectored to the area by Ground Control Intercept, and the pilots reported sighting unidentified objects. The majority of the objects appeared to be spherical in shape and were brightly lighted. The pilot reported the objects were capable of extremely high rates of speed and abrupt maneuvers. The pilot, Captain Billie J. Elias, informed Major George Taylor at Boiling AFB that he was signaling to Base Operations Officer, Major George Taylor at Boiling AFB, terminating his pursuit at that time.
