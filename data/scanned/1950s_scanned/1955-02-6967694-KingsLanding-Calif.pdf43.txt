a lot of trouble and why I am contacting you. First of all a thing that has burned in my craw for many years is the sighting of this UFO near KINGS LANDING, CALIF. I have had a few years to it ends together, to talk to people, and gentlemen, I know the story.
You know the story. Just how things are handled up at top level, I don't know.
The trim-framing that goes on is something fantastic. Now the craft that I sighted over KNIGHTS IS. did not belong to the U.S. government. It did not belong to Russians, since no other nations were advanced enough to have aircraft of this size and category. 
Then, if it did not belong to the Russians, and it did not belong to we Americans, who did it belong to? It is very simple, it was a space craft from outer space. Now whether you like this or whether you don't, like it, the facts stack up. I don't care what your reports show, I could write 500 pages, presently built up from that initial observation. Now I'm not trying to make you tell the American people more than they should know, but gentlemen, there does seem to be something fantastic going on.
