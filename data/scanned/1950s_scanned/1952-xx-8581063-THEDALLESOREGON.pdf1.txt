CIVILIAN OBSERVATION
WHILE ENROUTE TO PORTLAND FROM THE DALLES OREGON, AT ABOUT 2:40 PM TODAY, DECEMBER 26, 1952, MY WIFE AND I SAW AN UNUSUAL OBJECT IN THE SKY. IT APPEARED TO BE ROUND, SILVER IN COLOR, AND TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST. IT WAS SILENT AND LEFT NO TRAIL OR VAPOR. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW.
