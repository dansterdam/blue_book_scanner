Dear Mr. Klass

I lack the technical background for full appreciation of your detailed account of the RB-47 UFO case, but the explanation you derive from your detailed analysis of the evidence provides a reasonable solution.  

Thank you for sending us copies of your report.

Sincerely

MAURER MAURER
Chief, Historical Research Division
