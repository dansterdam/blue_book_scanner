difficulty with a truck in the mountains in the Oak Ridge area on 30 Nov 1950.
It was stated that this truck was on a seldom used road and was carrying a partially covered military-type cylindrical object. The comments on the incident specifically spoke with a foreign accent. However, from the standpoint of technical intelligence, it appears that there is no relation between the two incidents. There are no electronic countermeasures known to this department that would cause such radar targets as those reported on 29 and 30 November 1950.
