This image does not contain a photograph. It is a page from an old UFO report document, specifically from Project Blue Book.

WITH REGARD TO YOUR COMMENTS ON THE GREAT FALLS, MONT: INCIDENT, THIS MATTER WOULD BE HANDLED BY THE PERSONNEL AT YOUR HEADQUARTERS AS THOS MATTERS PERTAINING TO UFO'S ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AIR FORCE AND ITS PROJECT BLUE BOOK. THE REPORT INDICATES THAT NO JET AIRCRAFT WERE INVOLVED IN THE SIGHTING NOR WERE ANY PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN. THE SIGHTING WAS REPORTED USING TWO JET AIRCRAFT MAKING VARIOUS MANEUVERS, HOWEVER, NO PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE WAS OBTAINED. THE FACT THAT THESE AIRCRAFT MERELY APPEARED TO BE CIRCLING IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA DURING OR IN THE VICINITY OF THE SIGHTING, DOES NOT NECESSARILY INDICATE A CONNECTION WITH THE INCIDENT. THAT TYPE OF AIRCRAFT ACTIVITY IS VERY COMMON AND PROBABLE EXPLANATION OF THE SIGHTING.
THIS AIRCRAFT IS IN THE VICINITY. FACT INDICATION FROM MICHALAK THIS CRAFT HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN OFF IN HIS PRESENCE. WE HAVE NO MEANS OF DETERMINING THE PRIME CAUSES OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS INCLUDING THE GREAT FALLS, MONT. INCIDENT. UNCLASS#IED SOG - 13399780-5
