The object seemed to be "aluminum color." There were no lights on in nearby houses, and there are no street lights in this neighborhood. XXXXXKXXXKXXXKXXXKXXXKXXX the sky was cloudy. The source of the original bright light was not definitely established, but was assumed to be due to the object. During the entire period of observation the object was visible because of the light given off by two clouds of glowing gas which the object gave off. This gas emanated from two sets of tubes or "machine guns" in the rim. The gas did not seem to be propelling the object. The witness says that the light was sufficient to light up the surrounding ground, but threw no shadows on the project itself. She did not notice if other shadows ( from telephone poles, etc.) were present. The smoke was a gray-pink color.  

The object seemed to be solid, as nothing in the background could be seen through it. It was seen against a stationary and familiar background. The witness was looking down at it during the time it was stationary, so her estimates of size and location must be reasonably accurate.

The bright light which alarmed Mrs. XXXXX was seen by four other people in the neighborhood. One woman heard the whirring noise. No one else saw the object.

The same night, at 2:30 am, Mrs. XXXXX of XXXXX, Lorrain, was startled by a bright light which made the room she was sleeping in like "it was 6 am instead of 2 am." She thought that the sun had risen. The light mystified her, so she went to the window to try to discover the cause. Looking up in the sky, she saw a red object.
