The document appears to be an official report or correspondence related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated reports of unidentified flying objects. The text reads as follows:

"The report originally submitted has been changed somewhat as a result of more complete information. The original report was misleading in certain respects and additional comments are necessary.

The object was first observed at approximately 8:00 pm EST on 7 September 1957 by two observers at Mantauk, N.Y. The observers first noticed a bright, flashing light in the southwest sky at about 10 degrees above the horizon. After observing the light for about 2 minutes, it disappeared and reappeared at a different location, approximately 25 degrees to the west of its original position. The light was observed for a total of about 5 to 7 minutes before disappearing completely.

No further information."

The report is signed by "George T. Denton" and dated "7 Sept 57".
