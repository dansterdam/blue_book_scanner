FROM: L (Unit)

PART FOUR

PAGE 6 OF 10 PAGES

1. SOURCE:

Address: Aurora, Maine, (HJGG 4051).

Age: 35

Occupation: Sporting Camp Owner and Operator on (censored) Maine, (HJGG 4158).

Education: Grade School.

Qualifications: Mr. (censored) has in the past been a police worker in New Jersey, and also on the Maine State Police. At the present time, he is a (censored) for Hancock County, Maine.

II. RELIABILITY: While locating Mr. (censored), several residents in that area remarked on the reliability and integrity of the man as being above reproach, and that if he reported seeing this object, he surely saw it.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: While moving from one fishing spot to another on Great Pond on Friday afternoon, 19 July 1956, Mr. (censored) happened to be looking at the scenery around the lake, and spotted the object. He estimated it to be directly north of the position of his boat. The object was sighted at approximately 2100Z 19 Jul 56. It was moving rapidly from west to east, and he observed it for at least six seconds. The sun at the time was well to the left of the object, in fact at an angle of at least 90 degrees, from the sun to the object, at the horizon below. The sun was in the west, and he estimated the object to be at about true north. It was much brighter than the sky behind it, about the intensity of an automobile headlight several blocks away, and leaving behind it a grayish colored trail. This trail soon dissipated though, much quicker than a trail left by a jet aircraft. Mr. (censored) was wearing eyeglasses at the time, as he does constantly.

There was no sound from the object, but the head or front of it was bright and sharply outlined, while the back or tail, was fuzzy and blurred and seemed to be of a blue and gray color. It was shaped like a tube, with a head which resembled a football in contour. He estimated the object to be approximately ten feet long. (Part of this length, in fact all of it, could have been the trail of fire which was left behind). It was estimated by Mr. (censored) to be approximately the size of a quarter in diameter if the quarter was held at arm's length.

This object appeared in the sky and disappeared again, much the same as one turning on and off an electric light. Mr. Larson stated that if he was going to try to reproduce this object in its entirety, he would first start with one of the old type sealed beam headlights which were not glare proof, and from there on it would be difficult to choose a metal or material which would compare with this.

At the time Mr. (censored) discovered the object, he was moving northward on the lake, and immediately after seeing it, he cut his motor and drifted while watching the object. As soon as it disappeared he proceeded to his landing and attempted to call the GOC post which is only a short distance from his camp. Failing in this, he proceeded by car to the post where his report could be easily dispatched to the Filter Center.
