Relative to Radar Sightings
1. Re Radars now operating on ground
a. Observations of direction, range, speed, altitude and size of targets:
b. Did target execute any turns? If so, what angle (180 degrees), etc. And what radius of turn. If possible, how long did the target stay in the turn and what was its speed.
c. Note particularly any separation of distant target into several targets upon approach.

e. Did radar echo signal disappear suddenly or gradually?
2. If airborne, when object was sighted:
a. Were there any radar indications or extra noises on radio circuits?
b. Give estimates of size, speed, maneuvers, etc. 
GENERAL
