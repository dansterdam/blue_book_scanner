Mercury, which appears at the middle of April, has mean distance from the sun of only 36,000,000 miles, somewhat moro than a third the earth's distance of 93,000, 000 miles.
As it swings around the sun, it ,appears alternately to the west and east of that body. In the former case it moves ahead of the sun as they make their daily trip around the sky. Then it may appear just before sunrise, in the morning twilight. When east of the sun, as it is in April, it remains above the western horizon after the sun has set. However, this does not always bring it into our view.
When such an eastern "elongation" occurs in the autumn, it is not nearly as favorable for evening viewing as when it occurs in the spring.
In April this year conditions are almost at their best, so take advantage of your opportunity.
Even when Mercury does thus come into view, it neve remains visible after twilight has faded and it is never seen very high in the sky, while the period over which it can be easily observed is not more than about a week.
The great Polish astronomer Copernicus, who showed that the planets revolve around the sun, is said never to have seen Mercury. Even at on elongation, the low-flying mists usually obscured it.
