Or us Are Standing At Ric HeLeau's Tungsten 
Min At RAIL ROAD Danby. (There Arc Two 
Danby's One Called Railroad Danby and the Other 
Highway Danby about 1 Mi. apart North Easterly) 
We Are Prospectors and Miners and it Appx. 
2 PM. Happened to Look up Toward the 
Clipper Mountains To A Point About 4 1/2 Mi 
away straight Over Highway Danby and I 
noticed A Very Bright Reflection About 
By Thee Setting Sun. It looked like A Strong 
Glim Or Glimmer Like a Star Thee Called 
Attention, to it. Said It just 
Be A Bank of Mica. 
Stated He Didnt Believe There Could be That 
Much Mica Over There On thee Slopes Because 
He Prospected the Area and Had in 
Time Past. It Just Look Mica led him 
Any way the Terrain is Rough and contains 
Some fairly Sleep Washes Also while it 
Looks flat And Slopes Up To the Hills 
Up To the Mountain Range. Wm stated 
That he had Naticed it Before (halites in 
Railroad Danby) And As He Put it "Theres 
Something Over There That Dont Belone Over 
There." In About 20 Minutes. The Reflection 
Went Out And Without The Sun You Right 
See it. The Next Day Quite By Chance
