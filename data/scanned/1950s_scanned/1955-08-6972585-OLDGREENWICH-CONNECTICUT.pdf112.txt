According to the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) output, the text in the document reads:

"THIS WAS NOT THE TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL WHERE ONE WOULD LOOK FOR A HOAX OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. HIS HOME WAS A WELL-KEPT ONE AND HIS FAMILY SEEMED QUITE NORMAL - THE TYPE OF WITNESS THAT ONE USUALLY LOOKS FOR IN A CASE LIKE THIS. HIS STORY SOUNDED SINCERE AND I BE LIEVE IT. HE GAVE ME QUITE A FEW FACTS ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND THEY ALL SEEMED TO CHECK OUT. 

ALTHOUGH THIS HAPPENED IN A RATHER REMOTE AREA, THERE WERE SEVEN OR EIGHT CONCERNED CITIZENS WHO ALSO WITNESSED THE INCIDENT AND COULD VERIFY HIS STORY.

THROUGHOUT THIS I HAVE TRIED TO ADHERE TO AN ATTITUDE OF SKEPTICISM. I WAS A INITIAL BOUT ONE OF THOSE WHO DID NOT BELIEVE IN FLYING SAUCERS. HOWEVER, AS I HAVE LOOKED INTO THE EVIDENCE, AND AS WITNESSES HAVE TOLD ME THEIR STORIES, I HAVE CHANGED MY OPINION SOMEWHAT. I STILL AM QUITE SKEPTICAL OF SOME OF THE WILD REPORTS THAT GET CIRCULATED, BUT I DO FEEL THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO THESE INCIDENTS. CERTAINLY, I WOULD SEE NO REASON TO HOAX AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS AND I BELIEVE THE WITNESS IN THIS CASE. THIS REPORT MAY THUS BE OF SOME SIGNIFICANCE IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE SUM OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THIS SUBJECT."
