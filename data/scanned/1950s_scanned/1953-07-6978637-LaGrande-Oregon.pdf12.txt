Observers account of sightings:
Between 5:30 and 6 p.m. on April 28, 1953, four witnesses observed a light in the sky which appeared to be a white or luminous ball of some kind. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes and was seen at an elevation of about 35 or 40 degrees above the horizon. The object was stationary and did not follow a straight course or change in altitude during the observation. The object was very bright and appeared to wink out or go dark suddenly and disappear from view. The witnesses stated that the object could not have been an airplane, balloon, or any other conventional aircraft and the description did not fit any familiar object to them.
It was the opinion of the witnesses that the object was a foreign aircraft testing some new type of propulsion system. The witnesses were reliable, responsible people and their narrative is considered an honest account of what they observed.
