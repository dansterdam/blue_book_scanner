SUBJECT: (U) Unidentified Flying Object Report
TO: AFCIN-4bt                                 FROM: AFCIN-4b1     DATE: 30 Jul 58

1. Reference attached UFOB report.

2. The information in this report is very meager and, therefore, insufficient for accurate evaluation. However, there is a possibility that the IFF equipment was not working properly since the target appeared only on IFF and at an extremely high speed.
