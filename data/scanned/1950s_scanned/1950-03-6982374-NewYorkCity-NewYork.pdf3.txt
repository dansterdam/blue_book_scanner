New York City, New York
March 6, 1952
Project Blue Book case #6982374

On March 6, 1952, at approximately 7:15 pm, a New York City resident reported seeing a bright, cigar-shaped object hover over the city for several minutes before accelerating and disappearing rapidly. The object was described as metallic in appearance, approximately 30-40 feet in length, and emitting a bright white glow. No sound was reported.

Several other witnesses in the vicinity corroborated the sighting, but no other physical evidence or photographs were obtained. The case was investigated by Project Blue Book and classified as "unidentified" due to the lack of conclusive information about the nature and origin of the object.
