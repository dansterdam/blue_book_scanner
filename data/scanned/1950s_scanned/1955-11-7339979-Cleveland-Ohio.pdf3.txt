HUSH HUSH HONG KONG STYLE

Case 17: Hong Kong, China, November 28, 1955--A letter addressed to the editor of the South China Morning Post gave an account of a strange light and a jet crossing over Hong Kong. It reads as follows:

"On Monday, November 28, at 9:25 a.m., another person and I witnessed what appeared to be a reflection of any kind but a source in itself. The light was bright to be a reflection as it was shining quite brightly, not dazzling but still very bright, in the sky. It appeared to be a stationary light for a matter of three or four minutes, and then seemed to change its position. It was actually on a diagonal course, and the light appeared irregular at intervals, as if it were changing its direction or speed, and it remained visible for about 10 minutes and then disappeared completely. We lost sight of it because of its distance, only to reappear a few minutes later and then disappear again.

"This light or object seemed to be neither a plane, helicopter, nor anything else but some kind of 'flying saucer,' a periodically seen phenomenon that I am informed appears occasionally over Hong Kong. It did not go into the newspaper, and that is why I did not send any news about it. However, I thought the staff of the South China Morning Post might have some information about such objects..."

According to my Thailand correspondent, an editorial note appended the letter with an Occidental remark: "Coincidental psychological illusion."
