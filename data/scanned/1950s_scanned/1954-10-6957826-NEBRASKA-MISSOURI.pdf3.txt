Mr. Gallois stated: "It took away my breath! My body was struck by a sort
of electrical discharge. I could very distinctly make out a craft which looked
like a saucer.

I noticed three beings of small stature and of seemingly bizarre shape
moving around the craft. We sat as if immobilized inside of the little truck
unable to move. Only after the craft had flown away with incredible rapidity,
could we continue on our way."

Mr. Vigneron confirmed these statements of his companion, and so did
a third witness, Mr. Henri Chanez, who is a carriage maker at Le Carrie in
the community of Claracey.

Car Stopped by the Passage of a Reddish Ball

Saint-Etienne, 12 October

Two people from Gueugnon, namely Messars Jeannet and Garnier, who were on
their way home in their automobile last Sunday night, witnessed an inexplicable
phenomenon:

Suddenly their vehicle was overflown by a sort of reddish ball which passed
by like a flash. The engine of the car stopped and all the lights of the car
went out. A few instants later, when the luminous apparition reached the
horizon, the headlights of the car functioned again, and the engine purred again.

A giant rocket taking off from a field, has been seen by Mr. Pierre Vidal,
cook, living at Croix-Daurade, near Toulouse, and by his nephew, Angel Hurle.
The phenomenon disappeared in a luminous orange and pale-green light. At the
spot where the rocket had presumably stopped, the grass was covered with a
fatty vapor, smelling of petroleum.
