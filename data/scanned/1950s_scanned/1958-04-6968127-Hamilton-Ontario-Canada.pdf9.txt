SAFUS-3/naa Tracker jya/73328

26 May 1958

Dear 

This is to acknowledge your letter of 21 April 1958
concerning an unidentified flying object you saw on
13 April 1958 near Hamilton, Ontario.

From your description of the object, it had all the
typical characteristics of a bolide or "fireball". A
bolide is a very brilliant--very special meteorite.

Your careful attention to details allowed us to
identify the object and your report will become a part
of our continuing study on aerial phenomena.

Thank you for your interest in this matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
