Almogordo, New Mexico.  The Aerial Phenomena Research Organization today informed a member of the public information office at Holloman Air Force Base.  The color transparency shows an unknown object hovering over the Holloman Air Force Base.  Included with the picture was an expert analysis and attribution.  We would like to call it a "luminous cloud", said L. J. Lorenzen, Public Relations Director of APRO.  He simply do not form over warn desert country at low altitude ---formation would not permit the master control of this type of object.  He further explained, "It was stationary when photographed and was observed in the same position for fifteen minutes."
