Dear Major:

Enclosed is a letter which Dr. Hynek received quite some time ago, but when I have just now got around to writing to him, there was again mention of the incident to which Dr. Hynek suggests that it might have been a swamp gas. That is all the information as duration, appearance, size, etc. Not given.

Also enclosed is a copy of the letter which I sent to Mrs. _________.

Sincerely,
Kathy Boss
