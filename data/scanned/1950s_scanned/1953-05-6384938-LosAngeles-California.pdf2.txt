27 June 1958

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 1 June 1958 concerning the subject of unidentified flying objects.

The sightings you refer to have been evaluated as possible balloons. The long time interval between sighting and reporting these objects precludes a more accurate analysis at this late date.

For your information, I am enclosing the latest report of Defense that bears on the subject of unidentified flying objects.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
