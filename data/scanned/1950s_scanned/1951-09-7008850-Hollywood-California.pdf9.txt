There is no photograph or image present in this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document.

THE EXPERIENCE:
The whole thing happened so fast and was so breath-taking that it is difficult to remember exactly. To the second, the amount of time involved. I doubt if the whole thing lasted over five minutes and definitely not as long as ten minutes.

It was the fifth day of the moon, when somewhat less than half of the orb was visible. The moon was already below the horizon and the moon had just begun to reflect the solar radiance. I was walking south on Wilcox Avenue, between Yucca Street and Hollywood Boulevard. The moon was in south declination and hanging lowish in the south-western sky. It was alone in all its glory for there was nothing else in sight in the heavens - no stars, no planets - nothing but the moon, as far as visibility would permit. All alone in the cloudless, pure cerulean.

I wondered idly when the first star would begin to twinkle and would I be able to guess which one it was. I paused for a moment in front of the parking place and was getting ready to scan the skyline when it happened! No better time could have been chosen, no better setting selected for a glimpse of a star. Then it happened! 

From the farthest I could see in the south-western sky, a tiny point of light flickered into being. It grew swiftly brighter and larger, until in the space of perhaps a second it had become a brilliant, bluish-white, vertically descending light of tremendous brilliance. No better time could have been chosen, no better setting selected for what was immediately to transpire.
