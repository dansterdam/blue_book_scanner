Nov. 5-1957
Engineer 'Sunburned'
By Flying 'Thing'

ALAMOGORDO, N.M., Nov.
5 (UP)-An electronics engi-
neer reported seeing an un-
identified flying object on an
isolated desert highway near
Alamogordo in southern New
Mexico yesterday.

James Stokes, 45, an engi-
neer in the geair air research
project in the Air Force Mis-
sile Development Center near
Alamogordo, said 10 or more
automobiles were stopped
when the object appeared yes-
terday afternoon on U.S.
Highway 54, between White
Sands Proving Grounds and
the Air Force Missile Develop-
ment Center.

Mr. Stokes, in a taped inter-
view for station KALG in
Alamogordo, reported the
object approached from the
northeast over the Mescalero
Mountains. He said the first
indication that something was
out of the ordinary was the
gradual fading of the radio in
his automobile.

Then, he said, the car engine
died, and he noticed that sev-
eral other cars on the highway
had stopped also. Stokes said
he noticed that the occupants
were getting out of their cars
and pointing to the sky.

“Looking up,” Mr. Stokes
said in the interview, “I saw a
light-colored, egg-shaped ob-
ject making a shallow dive
across the sky to the northwest.

“Then it wheeled and made
a pass at the highway, across
the road not more than two
miles ahead.

“It then moved away toward
the Organ Mountains near

White Sands Proving Grounds
to the southwest.

“As it passed at its closest
point I could feel a kind of
heat wave, but there was no
sound.

“It had no viable portholes
and there was no vapor trail,
smoke or flame visible.”

Mr. Stokes said he remern-
bered the details precisely be-
cause he pulled out a notebook
and jotted down everything he
saw.)

“When I got back to my car
and checked the engine, I found
it intact, but the battery was
dead. It started with no
trouble and I headed for a
phone to notify officials at the
Air Force Missile Development
Center at Alamogordo.”
(An Air Force public infor-
mation officer told United
Press last night he had no in-
formation to report.)

Mr. Stokes said he noted
later, after he reached home,
that he had a severe sunburn.

James Stokes, 45, an engineer
from the Air Force Missile De-
velopment Center at Holloman
Air Force Base, Alamogordo, N.
M,, told news director Terry
Clark of station KALG, Alamo-
gordo that he and 10 or more
autos were stopped on an isolated
desert highway, U. S. 54, between
White Sands Proving Grounds
and Alamogordo Monday.

His description was similar to
ones reporting a big ball of fire
flying about much of this west
Texas area over the week end.
