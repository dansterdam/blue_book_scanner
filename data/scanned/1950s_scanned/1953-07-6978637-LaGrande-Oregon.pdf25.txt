AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM (AGENCY) 3211 F- L15, 45020 ATGS

9. VISUAL OBSERVATIOUS: Source's view of the object was never obstructed during the time of his observation.
10. AIR TRAFFIC: There was no air traffic other than source's observation.

ON 9 AUGUST 53, source was again flying in the vicinity of LA GRANDE. The object he sighted was lenticular in shape and possessed a metallic finish. The source first noticed the object while flying at 14,000 feet en route to Baker, Oregon. The object was first observed at a distance of about 15 miles. The answer he received was that the object had been the subject of unidentified aerial phenomena on previous occasions. This answer did not satisfy the source, however, and he was unable to obtain any further information.

COMMENT OF INTERROGATING OFFICER:
The source's request for information concerning the object he observed is understandable. Unfortunately, the information available for interrogation is so general that it does not enable the interrogating officer to be much more specific in his comments than the answers given to the source during the initial interrogation.
