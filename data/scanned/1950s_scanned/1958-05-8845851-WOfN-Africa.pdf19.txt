The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, describing an encounter with a UFO that occurred on May 8, 1958 near Tarpon Springs, Florida. The text describes the experience of two sisters driving on U.S. Route 19 who encountered a peculiar object in the western sky. It mentions that one of the sisters, Esther Freeman, took a photograph of the object, which showed a lighted area, but the photograph was too faint to reproduce.

1958 Encounter With UFO

On May 8, 1958 two sisters driving on U.S. Route 19 at the Tarpon Springs Road in Florida had a very peculiar experience. Miss Helen Alverson and her sister Esther Freeman were driving back to St. Petersburg from Brooksville. At about 6:30 p.m. both women saw an object in the western sky, apparently an object in the stratosphere. The course of their attention was apparently an object in the western sky, approximately 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon. Miss Alverson, an artist, checked the light intensity of the object, which showed a reading of 1800 as compared with the sun's reading of 2200. She took a photograph of the object, which showed a lighted area, but the photograph was too faint in the reversal to reproduce.
