COMET AREND-ROLAND AND INTERLOPERS

April 29, 1957: The following report is sent to us by CSI member Herman Hitchell:

"Mr. and Mrs. .......... saw something from their backyard in Hicksville, L.I. on Monday, 29 April 1957, from 7:55 to 8:05 p.m. while looking for the comet. They looked 'right after sunset' as the papers had urged them to do, most erroneously, and saw in the northwest sky: "...the comet. It had a red body and a red tail and was moving so fast that by the time we called a neighbor it was only a faint grey streak in the sky." Since I knew from personal observation that Arend-Roland was only visible in complete darkness (two hours after sunset, and their observation was made in daylight) and most certainly was not red or moving about, I went over and nailed the details down. The ten-minute period of observation is an estimated one. The object caught their eyes in the northwest sky some 15 degrees above the horizon (or houses) and was moving steadily towards the west and losing elevation. Red, elongated body; red, slightly fan-like tail about as long as the body, "most definitely not an airplane." It flew behind a TV aerial some 100 feet away "which was of the same dimension." A dime at arm's length approximated the aerial's expanse. The object became fainter, turned into a grey streak almost due west and was lost to sight entirely slightly south of west. Mrs. van Allen is my sister."
