MEMORANDUM TO LT COL EVANS:

In compliance with your verbal request following is an account of my observation of the incident at Patrick AFB on 20 July 1952:

At approximately 2130, I, together with Mr. and Mr., both employees of Pass Supply, was waiting in a staff car in the parking lot outside the dormitory when the driver first noticed a peculiar light in the sky to the south of the Base. We all then noticed that the light was fluctuating and appeared to move in an erratic manner for a few minutes after which it remained stationary. The light appeared to be unusually bright and at first was thought by all of us to be a star. It was not until we had watched this light and a peculiar maneuver which it made that we concluded that it was not a normal celestial light. The light seemed to flare up and fade alternately. After watching for some time, the light shot off extremely rapidly towards the Southeast and disappeared from sight. It was not noticed again. The light was a reddish-orange or pinkish color. It appeared to be fairly close and definitely not a distant celestial light. It had a somewhat dancing or flickering appearance as it fluctuated in intensity. I am unable to estimate the size or distance but it was quite brilliant and discernable. It happened rather suddenly and left no trail in the sky. We watched this light and a peculiar maneuver which it made that we concluded that it was not a normal celestial light.
