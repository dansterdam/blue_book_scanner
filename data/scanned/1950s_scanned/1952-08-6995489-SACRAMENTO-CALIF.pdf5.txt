Text transcription of the document:

was a little time trying to see if we could ascertain if it was a glowing object - from the dust and observations, it was glowing, a brilliant bright ball of fire. The morning the dust was not thick - the building was not bright except to hold to bright lights. As we were trying to see if it came over we didn't see much. We did a little experimenting to see if we could determine where the object was coming from or going to. We notice it seemed to gain or lose altitude. We are quite sure we all noticed brilliant light traveling in a north-east direction. Their flight was quite high-speed, and speed seemed to be maintaining a fair degree of constant velocity. We did not observe any sound nor trail of smoke or vapor behind the object. We will estimate the passage of the object took at least one minute. The next day we went in the passing where the object appeared disappearing cloud like grew lighter in the sky of high speed. Weather was partly cloudy with what we now think but thinking we had both but you become alarming.

Shapes this questionable lights in some way your investigation.
