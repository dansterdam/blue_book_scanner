The image appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report. It does not contain any photographs, but rather a typewritten memorandum describing the analysis of a hat worn by an unidentified individual. The memorandum discusses the purpose of the visit, the examination of the hat, and the conclusions drawn about burn marks observed on the hat.

Memorandum for Record
25 August 1952

Subject: Analysis of Maj. R. Harlan's Hat

On the morning of 25 Aug 52, Lt R. H. Olsson contacted Major R. Harlan in the Clothing Research Division of the Medical Unit of Aero Med Lab. Purpose of the visit was to show Maj Harlan the hat that had been worn by Mr. _____ and to determine some facts about the burned spots. Maj Harlan examined the hat and determined that the three spots that were believed to be burns were, in fact, burned, and that the part of the hat that appeared to be scorched was actually scorched. He stated that it would be possible for the hat to be scorched, but not turn the skin of the wearer since cotton turns at between 200 and 500 FÂ°, at which time it starts to disintegrate and carbonize. From the scorching on the hat, it appeared that the hat was present for only a short time. Maj Harlan believed that due to that short period of time, the skin could escape without suffering burns.
