1U5700th Observation Squadron
Trenton, New Jersey

1. The Air Technical Intelligence Center recently reviewed your report of the sighting and identifying of an unknown aerial object by one of your personnel on 1/18 March 1953. It wishes to commend the prompt action taken by your personnel in reporting this incident.

2. The visual nature, proximity, and behavior of the sighting and identifying the unknown object as it crossed the Islands formed by the Ohio considering that it was of considerable size and appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed in determining the object's identity.

3. The Air Technical Intelligence Center has received about twenty reports from the East Coast in the past month which have been analyzed as being the planet Venus. Therefore, your report and conclusion falls into this present trend.
