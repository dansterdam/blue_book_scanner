UNCLASSIFIED
MARCH 37, 1957, OXNARQ, CALIF. Subject Report on Observed UFO Cases - 27 March 1957.
The subject report was forwarded to this Headquarters by the District Informatio Officer at Oxnard AFB, California. The report states that on the evening of 27 March 1957, at approximately 2130 hours, an unidentified flying object was observed by several persons in the vicinity of Oxnard, California. The object was described as glowing red and moving erratically at a high rate of speed. It was last observed heading in a southwesterly direction. 
The purpose of the Air Force's investigation (in reference) was to determine as accurately as possible the identity and nature of the observed phenomenon. The investigation was conducted primarily to eliminate the possibility of the sighting being misidentification of a known celestial body or aircraft. Accordingly, it is the opinion of this Center that this case was probably a natural phenomenon, possibly a meteor or the moon, which was observed under unusual atmospheric conditions that imparted an unusual appearance or motion. The investigation did not reveal any evidence of a violation of our national security through the activity of foreign aircraft or missile systems.
