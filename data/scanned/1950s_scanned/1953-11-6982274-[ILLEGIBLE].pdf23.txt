The image provided does not contain a photograph, only text. As requested, I will act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion path, the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

The movement was observed either time by any of the objects light.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand and at about arm's length?
(Circle One): a. Head of a pin, b. Pea, c. Dime, d. Quarter, e. Half dollar, f. Silver dollar, g. Baseball, h. Grapefruit, i. Basketball, j. Other _____

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22):
a. Certain, b. Fairly certain, c. Not very sure, d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? _The light went out very suddenly_.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type construction would you make it? (How would it look in your own mind's eye?). What sort of appearance would this give the object which you saw?

It was a light that had an abrupt departure with the loss of an inherent brightness.
