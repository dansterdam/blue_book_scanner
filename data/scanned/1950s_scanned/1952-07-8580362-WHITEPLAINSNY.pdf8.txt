There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a sketch or hand-drawn illustration showing the observation of two circles or objects that were seen in the sky.

This sketch shows how the two circles appeared coming directly from the North toward the observer, traveling constantly on an even keel, as though attached together. The circles appeared larger than the sun and were moving in an eastward direction, before vanishing almost instantly. The observer had to keep turning their eyes to follow the motion of the circles until they disappeared from view.

This observation was made on July 17, 1952 at about 3:10 P.M. DIST by an unnamed observer in White Plains, N.Y. The document instructs the reader to see page 7 of the questionnaire for the description and color of these circles.
