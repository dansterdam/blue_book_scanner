Dear Sir:

I wish to pass on to you the following observation made by me while enroute to the wildcat well Amarade State RA 1, a wildcat well being drilled in Sec 22, Township 5 South, Range 25 East, Chaves County, New Mexico. Whitesell Drilling Co. has only military significance. I do not know but you may wish to investigate.

Below are the contents of what I wrote after getting to the well at 5:30 P.M. (5:30PM) New Mexico Time. The elapsed time was due to the need to file by the samples in order to repair in radio.

To whom it may concern:

__ being of same mind and body wish to make the following statement. At or about 5:50 P.M. New Mexico Time, while enroute to the wildcat well Amarade State RA 1, within a mile of the location I observed the following phenomena:

An orange red ball, wider in the center than its outer edges appeared, the first time I saw it, it appeared in a vertical position. I would say it lasted ten seconds; it seemed to come forward and then, though it did not actually stop, it seemed to stop coming forward and receded. I thought at first the sun was coming back out (it was raining very hard) and the rainstorm was going to cease. A few seconds later it reappeared, this time much closer. (It seemed to stop raining?) I would say maybe a mile or a mile and a half away, in a horizontal position. This time it lasted at least 15 or 20 seconds or it may have lasted longer.
