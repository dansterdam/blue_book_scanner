The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document or report related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

"Also, according to Captain's notes, there was probably some moisture in the air, which in itself indicates inequalities of temperature and/or humidity.

A thorough study of the situation showed that inversions of both temperature and humidity must have been present. In the summer of 1952, the Chesapeake Bay area was subjected to extreme drought, and the ground cooled rapidly after sunset, causing the lake of cloud cover during the day. In a period of heat and drought, the nightly cooling preceding sunrise marked inversions favorable to excessive reflection or refraction. Small in extent, existing only briefly in one place, constantly changing location, such inversions may not be detected by conventional observations [sic]. During July and August, temperature inversions occurred almost every night in the general region and accounted for the radar angels so frequently observed in the Washington area during those weeks (see Chapter XX).

The first of the sightings occurred over Chesapeake Bay at midnight. A body of water cools more slowly than the land, and the air over water is warmer than that over land. The cooler air from the land is carried over the water by convection currents. Blows in and under the warmer air, is heated by the water and rises, to be replaced in turn by the further flow of cold air from the land. The air over a large, open body of water may contain pockets or other bodies of water who has a higher moisture content than over the land and can form an invisible haze. All these facts had been insufficiently to the conclusion that such sharp gradients of temperature and humidity must have existed over Chesapeake Bay on the night the UFOs appeared. A light on the Virginia coast, shining northward toward the plane, could easily have been spread out into a series of images like those observed. A change in the orientation of the light or a shift in the location of the inversion would account for the abrupt change of course made by the disk."
