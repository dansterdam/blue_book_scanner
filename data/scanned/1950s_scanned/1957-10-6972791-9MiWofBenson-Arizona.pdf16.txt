The image appears to contain text and no photographs. As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

No intensity variations were observed. The object crossed our parallel of latitude somewhat east of us at an angle of roughly 45Â° relative to our location.

We later concluded that the object seen could not have been the satellite rocket, since the latter had a southeast-northwest orbit, while the object we saw traveled southeast-north-northwest. This object appeared fourteen minutes after the rocket was expected and exhibited none of the variation in light intensity which had been reported for the rocket.

The satellite itself was not seen at 1939, but its radio signal on 20.005 me was heard from 1814 to 1915, passing around 1839. The signal appeared 2002 to 2022, speaking around 2015; the difference in time of the two signal peaks is ninety-six minutes, as expected. Thus, we believe that the satellite orbit information we had was correct.

The objects we sighted have, so far, not been identified. Three photographs were taken, and these show clearly that what we saw was much too bright to have been airplane lights. The pictures were time exposures taken with a 1 x 5 camera mounted on a tripod. The exposure time was roughly five seconds, and the film was Royal Pan with an ASA speed of 400. The details of each shot accompany the respective prints.
