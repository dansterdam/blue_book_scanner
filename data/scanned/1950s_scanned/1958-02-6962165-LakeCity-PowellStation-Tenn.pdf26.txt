Density inferred from 1958 Alpha
Dr. Charles A. Whitney provided orbital data for the American Satellite 1958 Alpha (U.S. Explorer 1). The data, including the mass, the area-to-mass ratio, the mean distance, the mean density, and the perigee and apogee, was used to calculate the density of the satellite. The density was found to be about 1.5 x 10^-14 g/cm^3 at an altitude of 363 kilometers (225 miles), which is about 14 times that predicted by the research model.
The aerodynamic drag coefficient has been taken to be 2.
