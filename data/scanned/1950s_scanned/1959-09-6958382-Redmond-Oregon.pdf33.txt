MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR, LEGISLATIVE LIAISON, SAFLL
ATTENTION: Major Will, Section C

SUBJECT: Reply to Senator Magnuson Regarding UFOs

The following is a draft of a reply to Senator Magnuson.
``` 

```
"I refer to your recent inquiry in behalf of Mr
of Bucoda, Washington concerning the unidentified flying object sighting
of 24 September 1959 near Redmond, Oregon

"On 25 March 1960, the Air Force informed the National Investigations
Committee on Aerial Phenomena of all of the facts and findings in con-
nection with this particular ufo sighting. A copy of this letter is
attached for your information. The letter is self-explanatory and in-
dicates that the finding of "insufficient data" in this particular case
was definitely a valid conclusion. 

"The Inspector General's Brief of 24 December 1959 was simply a 
reminder to all Air Force activities that investigations of unidentified 
flying object sightings must be thorough, immediate, and accurate."
