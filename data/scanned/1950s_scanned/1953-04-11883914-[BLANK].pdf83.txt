SIXTH STATUS REPORT

ON
CONTRACT AF-19-7411, PPS-100 
to
AIR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE

This report describes progress for the period from September 11, 1952,
to October 10, 1952.

ANALYSIS OF EXISTING SIGHTING REPORTS

Work has continued on the coding of sighting reports to permit
analysis by IBM machines. Reports up to and including 1951 are completed
except for final evaluation of about 40 per cent of them. It is anticipated
that final evaluation of all reports of sightings previous to 1952 will be
completed during the month of October, in conference with ATIC personnel.
Therefore, by the end of October all sighting reports for the years 1947, 1948,
1949, 1950, and 1951 will be ready as a group for preliminary analysis on IBM
equipment.

Sighting reports for the first four months of 1952 were received
late in September. Coding of these early 1952 reports was begun and should
be completed, except for final evaluation, by October 20. Because the quality
and quantity of information in many of the 1952 sighting reports has improved,
the final evaluation of these will take longer.
