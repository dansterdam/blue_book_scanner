Dear Capt. - 
They have you right up to date on the incident in this case. We haven't heard anything more about it. What I they conclude to explain the acceleration is being checked into from what they received by teletype. 
Over Salton sea, short distance and good look. They said "objects" were of a highly metallized nature, they were accelerated at a high rate of speed on a course of about 20 degrees south to north, and disappeared. We too have not been notified that they were identified. But E.T. should have no difficulty locating them. Unfortunately, all military and so your sighting.
