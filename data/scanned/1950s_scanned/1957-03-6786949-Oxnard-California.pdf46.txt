NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE
ON AERIAL PHENOMENA
WASHINGTON D.C.

May 9, 1957

Commander 4602 Air Intelligence Service Squadron
Oxnard Air Force Base
Colorado Springs, Colorado

Dear Sir:

We have received a letter from the 4144th Fighter Group, Oxnard Air Force Base, stating that our letter of April 25th had been forwarded to your office for action. Since your Squadron investigated the UFO's involved.

In our letter to Commanding Officer at Oxnard Air Force Base, we asked for copies of the pilots' reports and the radar reports of the unidentified flying object sighted over the air base on March 23rd. In addition, I should like to request at this time a copy of the Project Blue Book investigation by the 4602 Air Intelligence Service Squadron, if this report is complete.

As stated in our letter of April 25th, to the C.O. at Oxnard AFS, we have documentary evidence that this sighting was investigated. Would you please send us copies of all reports and data pertaining to this sighting?

I am making this request as a member of the press. I am editor of the NICAP magazine, published monthly in Washington, D.C., for the membership of this non-profit organization. In order that we may know when to schedule our next issue, will you please write me at the above address, giving the date when you expect to mail this information?

The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena is organized to collect, evaluate and publish the concentration of the Air Defense Command and your Intelligence Squadron in particular in informing the public concerning sightings of unidentified flying objects. Our policy, which was once the policy of the Air Force, is to make public all the information we secure except the names of witnesses who request that they not be identified.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely yours,

[Signature]
Major USMC (Ret.), Director of NICAP
