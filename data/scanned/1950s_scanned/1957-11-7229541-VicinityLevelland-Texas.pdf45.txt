There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a typed or printed document from the Project Blue Book archives, containing text that has been partially redacted or obscured.

After being alerted to the object, several people from the area went to observe it. The object was described as circular in shape, about 200 feet in diameter, and about 30 feet off the ground. It appeared to be resting on a tripod-like landing gear. The object had a glow on the front and back, with a bright light in the center. It remained stationary for approximately 2 hours before slowly rising into the air and moving away at a high rate of speed. No sound was reported from the object. Several witnesses reported the object caused their vehicles to stop, and that all electrical power failed while the object was near. After the object departed, the vehicles were able to restart and the power was restored.
