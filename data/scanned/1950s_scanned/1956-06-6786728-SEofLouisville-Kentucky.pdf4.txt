CONCLUSIONS IN BRAZIL
So far four people hove claimed to hove contacted entities from other worlds and the only the 2 ores contacts mentioned by Prof. WATTLESTONE, who are well known to us. We hove sbriddged the stories of N.A.C.A. and PROF. WELKER,in order to show the truth, as we understand them. We will try to avoid any general cases" and 'the dumbness case" like the two former cases mentioned. However, we do not believe that these contactees are really truthful, we would find it extremely difficult to tell themselves why they hove lied. We are inclined to believe that it is a delirious experience without eny real foundation or possibly it may be just an experiment to make money or to become known.
POSSIBLE CAUSE: Many stories Just likè to listen to his vivid tale. 
RESULT: Those who seem to make money or be known by them
Hallucinations: Hallucination, Does she not want to write a book, reaches love and idea.how mail" and ideals have written books. Most has seiply said that the Sees intands to write some more books about saucers. At the bottom he is amusing himself hugely.
SIMEONE 30: He said that the thing will bo the biggest thing in ine history, but do not deal with; Headlive not only in Brazil but also in Europe. We are herein conveying first hand information as to something hoster, Because in School of Santos: he is president of the Lawyers Associations he is Chairman for Special Committee on Ufos.

The subject the Chairman case has been connected so they have written extensively to Ltz D. Ephoena, Vice President of Civilian Saucer Investigation of New york, 235 west 104th street -Newyork• Apparently, "Ltz D. Ephoene" received a letter from chairman and are informed that the long story be printed, we reprint it partly:
"I must make an obseroation. In the letter Alexander D. McKane of GSI of New York state that I think about it, but since I am sure that it is another hoax and that the long story bridged, we reprint it partly.
"It seems that flying saucers got fed up with so much visiting dalta in the Argentina and other latin american countries and that is the strange objects have been plaguing Brazil with their sudden appearances and disappearances that have puzzled Drszilian scientists. However, it is not only Brazil but other countries in South America which have now reached what could be termed as a peak to our standards.
"to generally speaking, now—a-days, such attraction as to common sight things, which are observed not only in Brazil but more other South American countries .21/9/55-27,."
