Case 272, Dallas, Texas, Nov. 24, 1956--Said the Dallas Morning News: "Residents at the Love Field control tower saw a brilliant fiery meteor" they thought was headed for them. "We sat there with our mouths open, wondering if it would hit Dallas. As it looked like it was coming down, it suddenly got very small and blipped out of sight." The phenomenon was first sighted about 6:13 a.m. by Ray Piper who described it as "like a big round ball. It was about 45' up in the sky, fell at an angle of about 20Â° and disappeared due south of Love Field." There was a loud noise like the falling of something heavy when it disappeared. The "tail" described as "at least 100 yards long, streaked across the sky and was completely dark." The center of the "tail" with long sparks shooting off the tail. The center of the tail completely dark. One side of the tail had a white and green fire streamed back as if blown back by a wind. The meteor streaked towards the earth, Oscar Monnie, meteoro expert, tried to track down the meteor and said that one was seen from Love Field must have been at least 5 seconds. He has been a big fellow with light for at least 15 seconds. The object at one point seemed to halt as if its end point was at least 150 miles south. Monnie had one report from a motorist 150 miles south between Austin and San Antonio and control tower personnel at Austin Municipal Airport also observed the meteor. Monnie said that meteors have a way of dropping into lightly settled land or wilderness and intelligence was guiding them under certain landings.
