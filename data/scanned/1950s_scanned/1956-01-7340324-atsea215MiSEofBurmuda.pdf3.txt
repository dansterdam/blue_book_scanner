rection, there was no visible acceleration. That is to say: it had a very
high rate of speed at the start and continued at this speed until it went
out of sight or disappeared.

4: The Second Mate is a Danish citizen, about 35 years old, and has 15
years' experience at sea. In describing the object, he likened its northern
flight to the tracks of rockets which he had seen during the war while on
patrol duty. He said the object's speed was V-2 rockets, which he had seen durÂ­
ing the war. His description of the object coincides with the report of the
man-made object which could be compared to this object in performance or
the ability to change its appearance from that of a falling star to that
of a rocket.

The foregoing data, including figures, was taken from the log of the
SABRINA (D4) and is submitted to the Office of Naval Intelligence for in-
formation.
