A 129-1758-17-57 SHEET 14 OF 14

15 JULY 1956

SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS (UFOS)

CONCLUSIONS OF PREPARING OFFICER:

1. It is the conclusion of the preparing officer that this is a case of MISTAKEN IDENTIFICATION, A HOAX.

SOURCE is a very congenial and sincere young man but he does appear to be HIGHLY IMAGINATIVE.

SOURCE stated in all sincerity that immediately following his "siting" he consulted his wife and she told him that she knew it was only his imagination playing tricks on him. However, in his own mind, he is firmly convinced that these objects were actual.

SOURCE is a very sound sleeper and extremely difficult to wake up.

It is the striking physical evidence coupled with the fact that SOURCE is a very sound sleeper and extremely difficult to wake up.

There is a possibility of collaboration with to publicize his siting, as similar reports were received by the local newspaper at the same time as the siting. However, this factor does not change the conclusion that this is a MISTAKEN IDENTIFICATION, A HOAX.

GO-MINUTES OF APPROVING OFFICER:

I concur in the conclusion of the approving officer that this siting was a MISTAKEN IDENTIFICATION, A HOAX. 

It is being returned to the originator under separate cover for further analysis.
