THE RECCRDE T AIRCRAFT DATA SHEET

OR PORTION OF A REPORT WHICH I HAVE JUST SEEN
THE WITNESSES' NAMES WOULD INDICATE SOMETHING AUTHENTIC
FOR THIS REPORT. I BELIEVE IT CAME UP AS IF THE SIGHTING
WERE AUTHENTIC AND NOT IF THE CAUSE WERE CR"l WITH
RELATION THERETO.

I HAVE CHECKED THE IS OF FLYING SAUCERS UP TO THIS TIME I KNOW OF THE KNOWN. MOST OF THEM I CAN GO ALONG WITH AS FAR SOUTH AS THE NATIVE SOVIET UNION - THEIR LANGUAGE, ETC. - BUT I SPEAK AS THE NATIVE SOVIET UNION UNTIL THE CRAFT BECOMES "OR AND ROUND" IN THE SHAPE THAT I AM FAMILIAR WITH - THEN I THINK IT IS REAL AS I WOULD WISH TO KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM. THE NORTH IS CLOSE BY WHERE I SPEAK AS THE NATIVE SOVIET UNION.

MY FATHER AND BROTHER WERE BOTH SERVICEMEN AT ONE OF THE OUTLYING STATIONS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE LONG-LAND WHERE I LIVED. I HAVE GIVEN YOU ALL THE DETAILS I CAN IN FAIR JUSTICE TO MYSELF. I WILL BE MOST INTERESTED TO LEARN OF YOUR FINDINGS.

AS I WOULD WISH TO DO SOMETHING POSSIBLE FOR SOME ONE DEAR TO ME, I AM WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE IF ANY ONE WOULD CARE TO HEAR MY EXPERIENCES. I AM SURE THERE ARE MANY WHO WILL VOUCH FOR MY INTEGRITY.

PLEASE FOR GIVE MY TARDY REPLY AS THE REASON WHY DOES NOT PERMIT ME TO ANSWER SOONER FOR THE PRESENT.

Your Sincerely;
