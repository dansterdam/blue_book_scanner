Radioactive Fiber At Horseheads
HORSEHEADS, N.Y., Feb. 22 - Dr. Charles H. Steinmetz, chemistry professor at Elmira College, identified today a certain amount of wispy gray fuzz as radioactive.
This fuzz, he said, spread over parts of this village 12 miles north of Elmira. Dr. Steinmetz said the fuzz may have come from a nearby community when the strong winds occurred.
Where the fuzz came from remained a mystery, Dr. Steinmetz said, tests revealed that the other two incidents in this area during the past few months (Horseheads, N.Y., February 24, 1955) the residue was identified as waste products from the local milk plant.

In one of the three incidents reported in other months (Horseheads, New York, February 24, 1955) the mixed hair was identified as waste products from the local milk plant.

On February 24, at Horseheads, N.Y., there fell a wispy gray fuzz of badly damaged cotton fiber. It was radioactive.
