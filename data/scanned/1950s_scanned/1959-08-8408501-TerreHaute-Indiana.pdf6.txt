TRANSCRIPTION OF TEXT:

Meteors such as that reported by you ionize at approximately 35 to 45 miles (72 miles as reported). The damages, however, occur only at the fringes, fireball have not turned away by 60 to 80 feet (37.5 miles). This is reported by you seems to indicate a flight of 60,000 feet. The observed probably was not a meteor but light reflecting off an unknown phenomenon at a high altitude. The absence of a trail, which would have appeared as smoke in the daytime, is not unusual, especially for such extremely high altitude phenomena.

Since the sighting reported by you probably lasted a relatively long time (6 minutes) it is possible that the witness shortenly after the meteor disappeared from sight. Experiencing such a sight is rather startling and it is possible that the witness was unable to recall the time lag between the sighting and the occurrence of sound.

I would like to recommend that you contact Dr. ________, who is conducting extensive study on meteors of the fireball class.
