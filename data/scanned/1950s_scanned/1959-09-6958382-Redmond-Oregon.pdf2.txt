Dear Mr. ______

    Reference your letter of July 14, 1962. The sighting over Newark, New Jersey on July 11th is considered to be an aircraft with advertising lights. Also, a blimp was reported in the area from Lakehurst at this same time.

                                            Sincerely,

                                            WILLIAM J. LOOKADOO
