TECHNIQUE MAKES INJECTION PAINLESS

FIELDS, E.
Dr. James Trevett, a dentist, reports that by
using a new technique of local anesthesia he
is able to make injections completely painless.
Dr. Trevett explains that by using a low-
frequency, high-intensity electrical field he is
able to override the pain receptors in the
local area of the injection and reduce the
discomfort felt by the patient.
The article notes that this technique is effec-
tive and safe, and that Dr. Trevell has used it
in thousands of cases without any adverse
effects. It is described as a major advance in
making dental injections painless.

Time Filled With
Doctors Report

DANGER, DOCTORS
DANGER, DOCTORS The real problem,
say medical men, is not physical injury but
rather the psychological trauma caused by
fear of the risk involved. Many of the reported
ill effects, they say, stem from this anxiety and
are not the result of radiation or other hazards.
The field has been learned by many doctors to
be a hazard-filled area and most are reluctant to
enter it, even with what they consider adequate
protection. They feel the risks are too great.
The article concludes that more research is
needed to determine the true dangers and to
develop better protective equipment and
procedures.

FTC Questions
Advertising Industry
FTC QUESTIONS ADVERTISING INDUSTRY

It wants to determine just what is claimed in
ads and how much the public really believes.

The article states that the Federal Trade
Commission is currently investigating the
advertising industry to determine what claims
are being made in ads and how much the
public really believes those claims.

The main questions the FTC wants answered
are: 1) What do advertisers actually claim in
their ads? and 2) To what extent do consumers
believe those claims?

The article notes that the FTC feels some
advertisers may be making exaggerated or
misleading claims that the public does not
fully realize are not true. The investigation
aims to gather data on the accuracy of ad
claims and the public's perception of them.

The goal is to better understand the effect of
advertising on consumer behavior and decision-
making. The FTC hopes this will inform future
regulation of the advertising industry.

Bladder Can Be
Grown Around Balloon

BLADDER CAN BE GROWN AROUND BALLOON

The article discusses a new medical technique
where a patient's own cells are used to grow a
new bladder around an implanted balloon. 

Researchers have found that by inserting a
deflated balloon into the patient's abdominal
cavity and allowing the patient's own cells to
grow around it over several months, a new
functional bladder can be created.

Once the new bladder has fully formed, the
balloon is then deflated and removed, leaving
behind the patient's own engineered bladder
tissue.

The article states this approach avoids the need
for donors or synthetic materials, and allows the
body to naturally grow its own replacement
bladder. It is seen as a promising new technique
for bladder reconstruction and replacement.
