The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document discussing details about balloon flights launched on September 6th, 1951. The text describes the call from General Mills in Minneapolis about two balloon flights, followed by a call from Mr. Kastner at the Research/Development Center of the Signal Corps providing details on the duration and altitudes of the balloon flights. The document also mentions the first release of the balloons and subsequent releases over the next few days, as well as the surface diameters of the balloons.
