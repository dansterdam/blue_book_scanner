The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

I would like to report an unidentified object, seen by a friend of mine at 6:30 a.m., 23 February 1958.

The object was brilliant and incandescent. The shape was like an elongated tear drop. The front part was a blissful green and violet glow, like a neon tube. The tail was like a smoky yellow and white. It moved in a 60° to 70° arc northeast to southwest. It was impossible for me to determine the height, but my guess is that it was definitely very high.
