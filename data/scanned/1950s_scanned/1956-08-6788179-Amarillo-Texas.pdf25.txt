1. The following are suggested answers to the questions penned by Mr Levine in the attached letters:
a. It must be assumed that the much publicized Washington radar sighting of 12 July 1952 is the one in question. This case was determined to be targets caused by a temperature inversion.
b. The objects in the film taken at Tremonton, Utah on 2 July 1952 were determined to be birds, probably seagulls.
c. The Air Force file carries no conclusion on the photograph taken near Amarillo, Texas on 2 August 1956. Not knowing what radiation vapor trail time exposure caused, the objects did appear unusual.
d. The Air Force file carries no conclusion on the photograph taken near Amarillo, Texas on 2 August 1956. Not knowing what radiation vapor trail time exposure caused, the objects did appear unusual.
e. The Air Force is not aware of any release date for the photograph taken by a "radar pattern" by the owner and he was free to do with it as he pleased.
f. The Air Force experience has been that there is no increase in radiation due to unidentified flying objects. It should be understood that the normal background for any area fluctuates a few hundredths of what a milliroentgen, this is considered normal and constitutes no danger whatsoever.
g. The Air Force is not aware of any statement, official or otherwise, to the effect that UFOs are space ships.
h. The Air Force has no specific knowledge of infrared tracking of unidentified flying objects.
i. The Air Force file contains no record of a report at Barber's Point, Pearl Harbor on 5 August 1953, in fact, no report from Hawaii.
