Dear Major Tacker:

I am writing you for confirmation and other necessary details of this alleged incident concerning an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting on the night of April 13, 1954 over western New York reportedly on which involved two Air Force jet planes from New York.

I am not quite certain whether he sighted the object called a "strange object" and the object and further than called the base.

The report further states that two jets were sent up from New York to intercept the UFO. The report ends by stating the jets trailed the UFO. As the object moved out over Lake Erie, it DIVED into the lake with the two jets following closely disappearing into the lake.
