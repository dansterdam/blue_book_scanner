2. On 18 June 1954, at approximately 1930 hours, this office was requested by the Senior Controller, Air Force Missile Test Center Interceptor Officer, regarding the sighting of an unidentified flying object.

3. On 18 June 1954, Major K. C. SMALLEY, Intelligence Branch, AFOATS, advised this office that he had received a report that at 2130 hours, 18 June 1954, civilian employees at a Patrick Air Force Base radar site near Indialantic, Florida, had observed an unidentified object or objects, which was described as circular, about 1/4 the size of the full moon, and was accompanied by a string of smaller lights. The weather was overcast, with intermittent showers. The object was observed to be approximately 100 yards offshore. The light flashes lasted for approximately four (4) seconds and recurred at approximately ten (10) minute intervals; the light began to cycle again for approximately ten (10) seconds, then went out. After the object had disappeared, the lights were observed on the water for several minutes. There was no sound associated with the sighting, and nothing could be seen. The lights did not re-appear after the sighting, and there were no other indications of anything further observed.

4. On 18 June 1954, this office was requested to determine circumstances surrounding the sighting of an unidentified aerial object on 18 June 1954. Concerning the thinking of an unidentified aerial object, it is believed that the likelihood of this being a meteor, natural phenomenon, or the like is quite remote.
