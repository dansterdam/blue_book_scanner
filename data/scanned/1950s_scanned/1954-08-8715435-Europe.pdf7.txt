MEMORANDUM

The chemical samples submitted were examined specifically for their copper, nickel, and other metallic content. All trace elements determined were 0.1-1.0 per cent. Nickel, cobalt, and manganese were less than 0.1 per cent, and magnesium, calcium, and aluminum were less than 0.05 per cent.

The samples appear to be low-carbon, low-silicon ferrotitanium. 

In this sample, chromium runs 57-71 per cent.
