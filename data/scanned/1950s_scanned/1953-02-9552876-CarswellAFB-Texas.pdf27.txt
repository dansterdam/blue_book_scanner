1. On the evening of 13 Feb 1953, various lights were observed that were travelling across the sky over Fort Worth, Texas. The weather was clear and calm. These lights appeared to travel in an unusual fashion which was reminiscent of a radar screen display. They would dart about, stop and accelerate at varying speeds. They were observed for a period of 10 to 15 minutes until they disappeared.
2. The lights were first observed approximately 500 feet apart and appeared to be traveling at a constant speed of about 1500 feet and came to a complete stop. In essence the other two lights duplicated this maneuver. After this maneuver the three lights regained the same manner only adding up and down vertical motion. These maneuvers appeared to take place in a horizontal direction. These maneuvers appeared to be controlled in a fashion similar to the early B-26 and B-29 throttle controls of World War II with the outer lights maneuvering in relation to the center light acting as a pivot.
3. The lights were next observed in a steep climb and attained an altitude of 20,000 feet. The lights then picked up speed and disappeared radar on -35 aircraft.
210, Aviation #7, it appears that the lights were estimated to be about 3-10,000 feet in altitude and travelling at a speed of about 3,000-5,000 yards per second. On a 2-3 multiplier, this distance would be approximately 9,000-15,000 yards or about 5-8 miles away. A sketch of the type formation received is attached as an enclosure.
5. Besides the members of Department 76 at Carswell, 2 other members of Department 76 at Carswell witnessed this incident. Their names and addresses are listed below.
