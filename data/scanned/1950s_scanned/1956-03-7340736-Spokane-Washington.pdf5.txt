The handwritten description states that at 16:30, a bright light was observed over Spokane, Washington. The light appeared to be bluish-white in color and was seen by several witnesses. The light hovered motionless for approximately 5 minutes and then accelerated rapidly and disappeared in a north-northeast direction. The witnesses estimated the object's size to be about 25 to 30 feet in diameter and its altitude to be around 2,500 to 3,000 feet. The text also mentions that the observers were interviewed and could not identify the object as any known aircraft.
