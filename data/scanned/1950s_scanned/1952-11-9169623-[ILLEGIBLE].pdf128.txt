30 October 1959

Dear Mr.

This is to acknowledge your letter of 17 October 1959 concerning UFOs. 

The United States Air Force had a UFO sighting on 20 November 1952, a 25 miles east of Selton Sea in California. AAMS's Mcclellan AFB pilot case was that the pilot saw a weather balloon at approximately 15,000' altitude. There were other 3-50 type aircraft in the air but none of the other pilots reported seeing a UFO. No radar reports of this sighting were received.

There is absolutely no connection between the Air Force sighting of 20 November 1952 and the popular science fiction writer, but this has never presented any of his claims to the USAF.

In answer to your other question, Air Force regulations maintain a minimum processing time to refute changes in procedure or policy. As requested, I am enclosing AFR 95-17 and AFR 200-2.

As previously stated, the only way I know that you can read the JANAP 146 is to visit this office.

The statement that each UFO investigation costs the USAF $10,000 is a commonly accepted misconception. The actual cost would vary in cost based upon the circumstances surrounding the sighting and the extent of the investigation.

This office has no knowledge of the statement attributed to Colonel Dean Hess or of a reprimand received by Colonel Hess as a result thereof.

Sincerely,
LAWRENCE J. TACKER
