STATEMENT

I, Aubrey W. Brenner, 2nd Lt., 10 2222870, assigned to the 66th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at Lockbourne Air Force Base, Ohio, am the observer.

While flying on a routine mission in a F-94B type aircraft, I observed a light that we estimated to be fifteen (15) miles southeast of Lockbourne, Ohio. This light was observed to be moving in a northeast direction at an estimated speed of 700-800 knots, or about 800 mph. It was moving at an altitude of approximately 17,000 feet.

The light was brighter than any known running lights and appeared to be emitting its own light. This light was observed for about 4 minutes and then it stopped suddenly with no apparent deceleration.

The set was tracked on the radar set in the aircraft and showed a definite blip. The light then appeared to move to another position approximately 10 miles away. This indicated that an unknown object or vehicle had moved this distance in a very short time.

At no time did we have a speed or climb advantage.

Also, at no time was there a visual contact made with the unknown target.

The foregoing statements are true to the best of my knowledge.
