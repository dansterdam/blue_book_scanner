The shared image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a statement from March 16, 1954 regarding an incident on March 11, 1954 involving a surveillance aircraft over South Park Military Reservation.

STATEMENT 

On March 11, 1954, Site H was on stand by surveillance, or airborne GIGI radar coverage, from 1900 to 2300 hours. ( NO 5,26 ) . It took us about 3/4 hour to locate the target which was not visible on the screen until it came within about 15 miles of our site. We kept it in automatic track and stayed in contact with it until it went off the screen. We were not able to identify the aircraft or object and could not determine its speed or altitude.
