b.  The light was estimated to be travelling on a heading of 170°, parallel to the runway which headed 260°.

c. The speed of the light was estimated to be at least 500 knots at an undetermined altitude and disappeared suddenly.

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
The factual reports advanced pertinent to the unidentified objects are well-documented accounts by highly capable individuals. The fact that the lights were seen cannot be questioned but it is entirely probable that the lights might have been those of an aircraft having its anti-collision lights inoperative at the time. However, the absence of sound partially discounts this theory along with the erratic flight path of the objects.
