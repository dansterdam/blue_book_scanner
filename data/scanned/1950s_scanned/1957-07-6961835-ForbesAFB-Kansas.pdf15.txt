The text in the document is as follows:

"The RB-47's navigation radar (AN/APS-23). This was confirmed by the navigator himself. McDanald reported. However, BCM (Capt) McClure of the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing told me that he, Frank R. McClure, was told by the crew that no radar was used for this purpose on this mission. In this case, it seems appropriate to accept the recollection of the pilot and navigator as the more definitive. 

Another example: McClure is positive that the mission on July 17, 1957, was intended for the RB-47's being sent overseas and that it was not a regular training mission. Rh-47 Pilot Chase disagrees. In this particular case, the crew members expressed difficulty in recalling details of the mission's purpose and the time it was taken. If such a log were available, it would have been turned over to the Flying Inspections Division of the Air Force. However, Strategic Air Command Headquarters contains only a spotty data. Further, McClure states that the flight had certain radio contact points, but no such log or evidence was found to check the UFO details.

None of the discrepancies between the crew members' original and recent accounts appears sufficient to establish any significant doubt as to the essential facts. Rather, they are believed to be the result of honest differences in recollection after the passage of a considerable time interval. There was an initial effort to investigate the incident, but this was not pressed after it was determined that no photographic or other tangible evidence was available."
