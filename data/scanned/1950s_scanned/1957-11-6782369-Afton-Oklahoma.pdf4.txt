DATE OF INCIDENT: 7 NOVEMBER 1957
LOCATION OF INCIDENT: U.S. AFTON, OKLAHOMA
TIME: 0240 - 0300 HRS

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT:
A blue, reddish, and green flashing object was observed by a witness. The object was stationary and made no noise. It was round or disc-shaped and hovered over a wooded area near Afton, Oklahoma. The object remained stationary for about 20 minutes before it suddenly accelerated and disappeared from view.

INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS:
1. The U.S. Air Force was notified and a radar check was made, but no targets were found.
2. Checks with local police and airport radar, but they reported no unusual activity.

PHYSICAL EVIDENCE: None.

FINAL ATIC EVALUATION:
a. A fast-moving object, thought to be a jet fighter, was investigated, but no evidence of such an object was found.
b. Flashing beacon-type lights on an aircraft could account for the sighting, though no aircraft were reported in the area.
c. A natural light, such as a planet or star, could have been distorted by atmospheric conditions, accounting for the sighting.
d. A reflection or mirage could also explain the sighting.

Conclusions: Other (ATIC): Probably a natural phenomenon, such as flashing beacon lights, a planet or star, or a mirage.
