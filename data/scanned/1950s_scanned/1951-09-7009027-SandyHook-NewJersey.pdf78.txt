Following is a transcript of the text in the document:

Following is a project transcript of an interrogation of T. S. Elliott, Pilot Interceptor Sq., Delaware. The interrogation was conducted by Sgt. J. R. Donahue, USAAF, on 29 Sept., 1951.

The subject's sighting occurred while airborne near Sandy Hook, New Jersey.

Also these men had been previously interviewed by the investigators. In coverage to establish the fact that the object sighted could not have been any known aerial devices, the information obtained shows that:

1. The object was quite silent, and the interrogation available to the investigators was verified as a real and concrete by the witnesses.

2. The question of communication or the information as examined reflects no satisfactory explanation. 

3. Observations of the object coviered a period of more than fifteen minutes.

(GPA-3) became aware of the existence of a fast flying object and investigated. Lt. Rogers to Maj. Ballard was transmitted over a radio conversation that there was an unidentified object moving at a very rapid speed. It was determined that this time the airspeed was 600 to 700 mph.

This incident is believed to be solved by a possible unknown balloon flight, but definitive information regarding the identity of the object is not conclusive. However, inasmuch as this is not certain, may have been a flight of test craft which are known to the Air Material Command to have a high speed capability.
