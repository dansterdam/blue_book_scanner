The giant went dashing
Through trees, making a perfect saucer
Landing near me. It was circular, about 30 feet in
Diameter, about 10 feet high at the center,
Tapering to about 6 feet high at the outer edge.
It was dull gray in color, with a row
of windows around the side. No protrusions
or projections. Absolutely noiseless. Hovered
about 1 foot off the ground, then shot straight up
and in about 5 seconds, it was out of sight.
The landing area was about 50 feet in diameter,
perfectly round, and the grass was flattened out.
I went to the spot the next morning and
found the grass still flattened. The landing
occurred on August 3, 1952 at 11:45 P.M.
