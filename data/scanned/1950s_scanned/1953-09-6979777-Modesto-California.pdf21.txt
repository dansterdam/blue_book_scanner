The image contains a photograph showing an elliptical shaped light, which the report indicates was captured from the top of a building in Modesto, California. The report states that the camera was oriented towards the east and left unattended for four hours, except for opening and closing the shutter. A civil defense ground observer crew noted an increase in a blinking light on the traffic pattern for approximately 20 minutes. The report suggests that the elliptical light in the photo is the result of the flash of an aircraft landing light.

Forwarded herewith is a photograph showing an elliptical shaped light. The photo was made at night from the top of a building in Modesto, California. The camera was oriented towards the East and was left unattended for four hours except for opening and closing the shutter. A civil defense ground observer crew noted an increase in a blinking light on the traffic pattern for approximately 20 minutes during the time the exposure was made. It is the opinion of the reporting officer that the elliptical light on the photo negative is the result of the flash of an aircraft landing light.
