The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a routing and coordination sheet.

As an OCR system, the text found in the document is:

As any optical experiment will show, an object will appear smaller in color as it recedes into the distance. The object here measures 4000 feet or over one mile and appears darker and darker than any object in the field of view.

The object does not appear to be consistent with that of the surrounding objects. A magnification of the image into three different densities reveals an object just inside the left density and the right density protrudes.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,
ROBERT E. O'CONNOR
Captain, USAF
Assistant Adjutant
