SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112

Attachment No. 10006th AISS
I. SOURCE: Mrs. Address: Arlington, Va.
Age: Approximately 50
Occupation: Housewife
Qualifications: No special technical qualifications or training

II. RELIABILITY: The physical and mental status of the source induced by over-indulgence was such as to preclude the possibility of a comprehensive or detailed interview.

III. COMMENTS DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Source stated that approximately 2230 hrs., she heard a strange sound outside and upon looking out the window saw an object in the air that appeared round, flat, and disc-like. The object, she said, was silver in color and was moving very slowly across the sky in a straight line from south to north. The object gave off no light, nor were any details discernible. The source could give no further information for the interval of time the object was in view, except that it disappeared from sight in a straight line towards the north.
