A telephone call received from Capt. Ballowrant, Flt Commander, 4602B Bat at Grandview AAF, Missouri. Capt. Ballowrant reported that he and members of his detachment flew down to Mr. ********** farm on Friday night, 17 Dec 54.
They found a 1600 acre farm on which he grows rice and cotton. The rice field is separated from the cotton field by a man made ditch approximately 15 feet wide. From close inspection of the area, it was evident that spontaneous combustion had taken place and some of the logs and weeds near the ditch line were burned as if by a fire. From the appearance of the burned area, it looked like a burnt path of some object.
A teletype report will be forwarded to ATIC by Capt. Ballowrant which will contain complete details.
