STATEMENT OF OBSERVER

I, Amos F. Miller, Colonel USAF 45231, is the observer, make the following statement with reference to an observed flying object:

Observed by me on 13 August 1952:

At approximately 1520 hours Pacific War Time, two man in formation objects were observed heading in a southerly direction, at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 8,000 feet.

The objects were bright and shiny and appeared to be hovering or in a formation for about 15 to 20 minutes.

I observed it for about 5 minutes until I lost sight of it while making a change in my position.
