in a paralled line. This white substance was
entirely unlike any jet vapor trail I have ob-
served. It is hard to explain the diffe r-
ence but it was perceptably different. For
one thing it was exceedingly thin and seem-
ed to have a fluffy appearance.

It was shortly after I noticed the trail
that if began to move. It was close to
some cirrus clouds and therefore I could judge
its movement which was steady and rapid.
Fearing that it would bee high out of I
ran into the house and found my pair
of 7 x 50 binoculars. through these I tried
to find the object again for about a half
a minute then it emerged from part of
the cirrus clouds and was perceptably accele-
ration in speed. It then passed into some
more clouds and then after this I was only
able to detect its reddish glow through
the clouds it entirely disappeared into the clouds.
When I first sighted it it was not hori-
zontal but about this [] I guess [] angle
it resumed this angle when it began to move
and appeared to be heading up toward
space and farther away from the Earth

Very cordially yours
