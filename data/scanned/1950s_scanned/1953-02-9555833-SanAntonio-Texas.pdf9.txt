STATEMENT

On the night of 26 February 1953, upon leaving the communications center in San Antonio, Texas, I observed a light in the sky and traveling at a high rate of speed. This speed was maintained for a distance and then it appeared to slow down for a while, then it again picked up speed and disappeared. I could not even guess at the altitude. One factor that makes me believe that it was very high is the fact that I first saw the light at approximately 8:20 p.m. at an altitude of 80 degrees north, and watched it steadily west for over a minute. When I first saw the light it was moving very fast, and then it slowed down for a while, and was again in the west. I again observed it at 8:35 p.m. in the west and it was again moving very fast and then it disappeared. The light was bright and steady and compared to the stars, it was much brighter. It was not blinking or changing color.
