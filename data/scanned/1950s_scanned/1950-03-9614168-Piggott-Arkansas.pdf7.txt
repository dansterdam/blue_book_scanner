TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

I hereby make the following statement of my own free will.

On Tuesday afternoon, March 14, 1950, about 4:00 P.M., I was standing in front of my service station in Piggott, Arkansas. I looked up and saw a four-motored airplane, believed to be a transport. The plane banked and made a complete circle. Then, I saw an object, other than the plane, in the sky. It was above the plane, in altitude, and looked like a one hundred pound sack of potatoes in size. The color of the object was white or aluminum. The object appeared to be eight thousand (8,000) feet in altitude and at a sixty (60) degree angle on the horizon. It was approximately seventy (70) degrees clockwise from the north and drifting from west to east, almost due east. It remained in view approximately ten (10) minutes.
