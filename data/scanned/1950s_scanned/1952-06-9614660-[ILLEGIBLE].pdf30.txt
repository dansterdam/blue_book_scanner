The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's official program for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs). There is no photograph contained within this particular page of the document.

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
UNCLASSIFIED
[REDACTED]
Report of Investigation of Unidentified Object Sighted in the Air on 24 August 1952.
At 2130 hours, 24 August 1952, I received a telephone call from [REDACTED], who stated that he had observed a strange object in the air over [REDACTED] at approximately 2115 hours, 24 August 1952. He stated that the object appeared to be round and giving off a red glow. [REDACTED] stated that the object was moving at a high rate of speed and appeared to change direction abruptly. [REDACTED] stated that two other people were with him at the time and that they had all observed the object.
As soon as possible after receiving this call, I made an appointment to interview [REDACTED] and the other two people who had observed the object. The interview was conducted at [REDACTED] on the evening of 25 August 1952. During the interview, [REDACTED] stated substantially the same facts as had been given to me over the telephone. [REDACTED] and the other two observers, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], corroborated [REDACTED]'s statement. All three stated that the object appeared to be round and glowing red, that it was moving at a high rate of speed, and that it made an abrupt change in direction.
During the interview, I asked the observers several questions concerning the size, altitude, speed and maneuverability of the object, but they were unable to provide any definite information on these points. They stated that the object was observed for only a short period of time and that it disappeared from view before any accurate measurements or observations could be made.
