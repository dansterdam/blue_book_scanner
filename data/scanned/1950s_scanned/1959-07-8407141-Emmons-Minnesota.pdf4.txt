Dear Major Tacker:

As I have not yet received any reply to my letter to you of July 16th, perhaps you could have an addition for my file forwarded to me.

As you know from earlier correspondence we have strange material found in Calw-up, Wis. which we have tentatively identified as to the metal portion of the unidentified object which fell in that area. We have both photos and pieces and slivers in the country, I have recently learned. Material which will, on further investigation, disclose the true nature of this strange fragment.

Minneapolis suggests that the material was identified somewhere else, and such is not the case. You could give us any further information about this that you could. If you could give us a photograph of the material, or a small sample so that we could identify it, I would be most grateful.

I would redirect your attention to my earlier quest for photographs of the two sightings as many photos relative to the two sightings as possible.

Thank you in advance for your continued cooperation.

Sincerely yours,
