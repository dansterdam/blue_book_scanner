"HIDDEN" UFO REPORTS GIVEN NICAP

NICAP has obtained copies of several previously HIDDEN UFO reports and investigation files. As these are the sort of reports that NICAP has long been trying to obtain, we consider this an important development. Most of these reports appear to have been deliberately withheld from public knowledge.

The files received contain a number of interesting case reports. Unfortunately, many of the details are still BLOCKED OUT or missing. However, the basic facts are clear enough to indicate that at least some of the UFO reports considered SENSITIVE or CONFIDENTIAL by the military and intelligence agencies are now being gradually RELEASED through NICAP's efforts.

From 1947 through 1955, a MAJOR PART of the more significant UFO reports were apparently CLASSIFIED as SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL, and shielded from public scrutiny. NICAP has long been aware of this fact from various sources, including former military and intelligence personnel.

Even though many important details are still MISSING in the new files, the GENERAL PATTERN of OFFICIAL SECRECY and DENIAL is clearly evident. These new reports reinforce NICAP's long-held conviction that the public has been systematically DECEIVED about the TRUE nature and EXTENT of the UFO phenomenon.

NICAP plans to make these new "HIDDEN" reports available to serious researchers and writers in the near future. At the same time, we shall continue our efforts to obtain the COMPLETE, UNCENSORED files on these and other important UFO incidents. The American people are ENTITLED to know the FULL FACTS.
