                                                    MR. GRIFFING: This is a new development, this
particular one, but there have been ones similar to this in
use in many observatories. Palomar has a Schmidt telescope.
                                                    THE PRESS: Are you ordering a number of those for
placing around the country?
                                                    MR. GRIFFING: That is a possibility.
                                                    THE PRESS: Is that a movie-camera type?
                                                    MR. GRIFFING: Not exactly. The plate is exposed
for ten minutes and then is replaced with another plate and
then so on through the night. That is, one can expose a
photographic plate for ten minutes without overexposure, in
fact, a longer time, but a continual record will be made. Any
motion that can be indicated with a time exposure can be found
with considerable accuracy.
                                                    THE PRESS: Does the Air Force have access to any of
those right now?
                                                    MR. GRIFFING: That particular thing is not in pro-
duction yet.
                                                    THE PRESS: How much does it cost?
                                                    MR. GRIFFING: Shall I go into it, General?
                                                    MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: Well, go ahead.
                                                    MR. GRIFFING: The cost will be between three and
five thousand dollars apiece.
                                                    THE PRESS: General, has there been any indication
that any of these radar sightings have been made by electronic
countermeasures being used by U. S. Strategic Air Command
bombers practicing?
                                                    MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: No; they haven't. We've
investigated that and come up negative.
                                                    THE PRESS: Is that Schmidt camera telescope the
only one, astronomical telescope that's capable of being used
on a project like this?
                                                    MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: Probably not.
