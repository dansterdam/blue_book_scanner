Text from the document:
A STATEMENT

A was shown an object in the sky located approximately 15° East of South. Objects appeared circular and metallic or white in color. Difficult to estimate exact nature as the light was being reflected from it in such a way that it appeared rather luminous at times. Object appeared to remain stationary and did not drift with the wind. At times there were white, fleecy bits of material floating in the sky which seemed to be approximately the same type as the object, but they quickly passed from view. These were not the object. When I left there were still white, fleecy bits of material floating in the sky at approximately the same position as the object had been. It did not drift.
