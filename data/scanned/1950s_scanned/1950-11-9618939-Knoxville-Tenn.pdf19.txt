The text in the document is as follows:

This information is forwarded in accordance with a prevGent made in telephone conversation between Col Indwigg and Col Dunn on 8 Dec 50.

Personnel representing ARC Intelligence Sect and Electronics Sub-Division visited Coil Ridge on 6 Dec 50. Matter was discussed with Major Carrol and Capt Curtis, WSFO project, together with representatives of G2 and CIC in that district. Matter was also discussed with Major Carr and Capt ??? at Radar station, Knoxville, airport. The investigators concluded that the targets which reportedly "blacked-out" the North east sector of the radar scope" were caused by ground targets which became visible due to "anomalous propagation" or bending downward of the radar beams. Pending
of radar beams is caused by non-uniformity of the atmosphere in either density or moisture content. This phenomenon is common referred to as "temperature inversion" and is considered to be a "normal" effect. The theory of how this effect occurs is too lengthy for further discussion here.

Important characteristics of the reported radar targets, as stated by the radar operations officer, Capt ???, are given below:

1. First target appeared in the northwest corner of the restricted area.
2. Additional targets appeared in the same general area and spread south and east.
3. All targets appeared in a sector between approximately 262 and 320 degrees and between the ranges of 12 and 25 miles.
4. Targets first appeared at about 1:45 and were seen until 2350 on 29 Nov 57.
