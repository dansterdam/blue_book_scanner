I went outside the we ther station about 7:55 p.m. on 6 Nov 1957 to observe the sky. At 8:00 p.m. I observed an object at about 60 degrees northeast altitude which moved across the sky in a westerly direction. While watching for about 15 minutes, the object appeared to stop and then resume movement in a southerly direction at a velocity that appeared to be about 500 to 600 miles per hour. The object changed color from white to orange to red. It appeared to have a vapor trail. The object made no sound that could be heard. It was visible for about 15 minutes, then disappeared from view. Visibility was good. The object appeared to be metallic and glowed with a steady glow. I observed this object with Mr. J.D.
