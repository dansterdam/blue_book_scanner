37. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this?
(Circle One) Yes No

37.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?
I saw there objects several times within a couple of months. I first saw one while driving home from work and I saw them on several other occasions usually late at night or early in the morning. They appeared similar in shape and size to this object, were high in the sky, and at first seemed like starts but were much slower in motion. I would see them hovering, then moving rapidly off at tremendous speeds, often disappearing almost instantly. This was a very puzzling experience and I am still trying to understand what I saw.

39. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
The object was definitely not an airplane or other known type of aircraft. It's motion and ability to hover and move at tremendous speeds argues against a conventional explanation. I cannot say for sure what it was, but it almost seems like the kind of thing described in UFO reports, a strange aerial phenomenon of unknown origin. Whatever it was, it was a most unusual sight and I am still trying to make sense of the experience.
