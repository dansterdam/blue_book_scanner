AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
AF FORM 112--PART II APPROVED: 1 JUNE 1955

1. A contact with 6th Weather Group, Pt-7, Norton AFB, San Bernardino, California, reported the following information:

a. A temperature inversion of five (5) degrees Centigrade existed at this time between the altitudes of 1500 feet and 1700 feet. The temperature at 1700 feet was 1.2 degrees C higher than at 1500 feet.

b. Winds aloft are are indicated below:

ALTITUDE WIND DIRECTION WIND SPEED
(IN FEET) (DEGREES) (KTS)
15,000 270 16
20,000 275 23
25,000 280 30
30,000 290 40
35,000 310 45
40,000 310 50
45,000 320 45

2. Dr. RONALD G. CARPENTER, Professor of Astronomy, San Bernardino Valley College, was contacted on the possibility of making observations in the Hollywood and Riverside areas. He stated that the weather conditions since 2300 hrs, 6 July 55 were such that the possibility of sightings such objects would be highly improbable. There were indications that the three reported sightings in questions were probably caused by the weather phenomena described in paragraph 1 above.

3. GEORGE STAHLERT, Professor of Astronomy, San Bernardino Valley College, was also consulted concerning this sighting. He concurred with the analysis and conclusions reached by Dr. Carpenter, and reliable in all phases of investigations with this exception--he was of the opinion that the duration of these sightings and the high degree of maneuvering reported precludes the possibility of any weather phenomena being the cause.
