STATEMENT
to 1300 hrs 2-9-53, the chief OF SGI operations AGO 723, was an duty from 1300
to 2400 hrs, when Sgt. Ray was sent to investigate a flight of 8 lights travelling
slowly at about 1500 feet. Col. Ellison who was the senior controller in on 3/35-,
Lt Ray Watson and PVT Sullivan to go outside and try to observe this. 
This activity was noticed by Capt I. Schreiber in charge of the elevations about 275 degrees.
Elevation about 20 degrees. The size of this object was that of a very large
aircraft. It approached to not more than 2 miles and seemed to be a single light that pulsed, brighter and dimmed repeatedly. Sgt. Watson called in a report to the operations
building at almost 22.25 2/9/ 53. Sgt. Watson said this object seemed to be about
4,000 feet and came in slowly with no trail or appreciable change of speed or direction. It finally just faded away as an aircraft travels out of sight. I would say the
53:^3,2 was illogical on the portion when it first seemed to be approaching for some reason.
