This page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book does not contain any photographs. However, I can provide the text from the document using optical character recognition (OCR):

UNCLASSIFIED
12 January 1957

SUBJECT: Late receipt of UFO reports

1. This is one of six (6) UFO reports submitted under one cover by the 4602d AISS, who received them from the 1st (reference "46022 AISS File," letter dated 26 December 1956, subject: "O.I. UFOB Reports.").

2. Received by ATIC on 3 January 1957.

3. Reports range from almost two years (February 1954) for the oldest, to over 7 months for the newest (August 1956). It appears that the OSI had "pigeonholed" the reports for some unknown reason before submitting them.

4. The very late date of receipt makes investigations or conclusive analysis difficult. AF has emplaced in the files a preliminary evaluation made of each and entered in UFO files.
