PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 20 Jun 58
2. LOCATION: Fort Bragg, North Carolina
3. TYPE OF OBSERVATION: Ground-visual
4. SOURCE: Military
5. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 10 mins

DETAILS OF OBSERVATION:
At approximately 2100 hrs, 2 Military officers, both pilots, observed a strange unidentified object in the sky over Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The object was described as being bright red-orange in color, moving in a straight line, and increasing in speed over a period of 10 minutes. At first, the object appeared to be about the size of a dime at arm's length, but it then decreased in size as it accelerated and moved out of sight. The object displayed a pulsating or flickering motion and increased in brightness as it moved away.

CONCLUSIONS:
The observers reported seeing a very strange and puzzling object. While the object was not identified, it does not appear to have been an aircraft or any other known type of aerial vehicle. The object's size, color, pulsating motion, and acceleration suggest it was some type of unconventional aerial phenomena. No further information is available to conclusively determine the nature of this sighting.
