2D-CSI 3A-119
(2) The observer was standing on the observation platform at the weather bureau observatory at eastover, southwick as he fixed his attention on a peculiar light while tracking a balloon at an azimuth of 120 degrees for southeast. He noticed that the light did not change attitude, and remained within an arc of 22 degrees from the horizontal.

(a) Information on observer: This observer is a weather observer (3) and no evidence to his familiarity with all types of aircraft was advised other than his training caused by his occupation. He could not account for the peculiar light by anything else such as search light reflections or shooting stars that he notoriously observed for the existence.

(h) Existing condition that might account for sighting: None. No physical evidence exists, and no interception action was taken.

ACTION:
Two (2) copies of this report have been forwarded to the Commanding General, Air Material Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. Attn: MCINT-A, no further action contemplated by this District Office.
