Program for Determination of Geographic Sub-Satellite Points

by 
Luigi G. Jacchia*

The sub-satellite-point routine was devised for the double purpose of rapidly analyzing incoming observations and of obtaining from them the basic results necessary to compute a search ephemeris. Osculating equatorial elements are assumed for a time t0 (either an ascending node or a perigee crossing) and integrated to the time t, the elements for this time t are then corrected for secular perturbations and drag.

The elements are given in the following form:

x^a = x0 + c^a + c^a2 + c^a3
y = a + d^a2 + d^a3
1 = constant
q = constant 

Here t is the time of ascending-node crossings, T
the time of the next ascending-node crossing, the argument of perigee,
i the orbital inclination, q the perigee distance, and
n the number of revolutions elapsed since t0. Ca, c^a, d^a
d^a are constants. The right ascension of
the ascending node, , (or the longitude of the node) since it is required only to know whether
the observation was made on the ascending or the descending
half of the orbit.

Every observation consists of two spherical co-ordinates
(right ascension and declination, or azimuth and altitude)
referred to a time t, and to a set of station co-ordinates,
which are fed into the machine program as input data. First
the machine computes the value of the node or perigee
crossing immediately preceding the observation's time and
from this value, the co-ordinates under which the observations
were made are computed from the formulas given in the
program.
