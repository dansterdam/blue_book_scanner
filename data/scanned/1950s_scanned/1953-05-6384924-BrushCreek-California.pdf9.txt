1. Investigation requested by Commander, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. SUBJECT: Information concerning an unidentified Aerial Object that had been sighted at Brush Creek, Butte County, California, on 20 May and 20 June 1953 by two miners.

2. On 7 July 1953, a letter was received from the Commander, Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, dated 29 June 1953. Subj: "Sighting of Unidentified Aerial Object, Brush Creek, California", which quoted a news item as follows:

"BRUSH CREEK, Calif., June 24--(UP)--Two grizzled miners today asked the Butte County Sheriff's office for permission to shoot at a "flying saucer" that keeps invading their mountain diggings."

The miners, who operated a small gold mine in a remote area a few miles north of Brush Creek, Fed Freeso and Joe Garcia, had observed the object twice on the afternoon of 20 June. It hovered at the junction of Marble and Jordon Creeks.

Each time, they said, a little man resembling a midget got out of the contraption, scoped up a bucket of water in a shiny pail, and then zoomed back inside and away without making a sound.

The object was described as having a tripod landing gear which left marks on the sandbar. The observers stated the craft was "trimmed."

The letter further stated that the unidentified object had been sighted on 20 May and 20 June 1953.

AT OROVILLE, CALIFORNIA

Sheriff's Office advised that two miners on 24 June 1953 reported sighting an unidentified Aerial Object near Brush Creek. Headquarters at the direction of Butte County Supervisor CHRISTENSEN further advised that neither sheriff's office in Oroville or in Butte County was known to have taken any action regarding the reported incident and that inasmuch as the reported sightings have occurred on the 20th of the preceding two months, the Sheriff's office had discontinued an unrehersed (sic) to the observed.
