STATEMENT

It about 2230 hours 26 February 1953, 2/Lt. William Stendridge told Lt. Willis in the operations building and asked us to go outside the operations building and observe what we could. He went outside the operations door (approx. 30 seconds) climbing and climbed on 10" or a 10 foot embankment. In west (azimuth 255 degrees) elevation approximately 500 feet. He observed that object more than a large star but less than a star and was enough to show definite round. It was ahout 1/2 diameter of star itself. It made a pulsating motion. He watched it for 2-3 minutes. While he was watching, the object started to move downward from 500 feet to 3 degrees elevation. It dropped in about 1 minute or minute and a half, then it stopped to about 10 degrees elevation and stayed there for a minute or so. Then it started to climb back up to about 70 degrees elevation and stayed there for awhile. Then it disappeared.  We do not think it disappeared over the horizon. When the thing disappeared it was 2215 hours.
