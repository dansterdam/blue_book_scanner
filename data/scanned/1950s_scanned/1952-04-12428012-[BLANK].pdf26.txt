Leaving our hypothetical airbase sighting case now, suppose the incident was reported not by a military person or organization but by a private citizen. In this case many of the procedures are exactly the same, but of course we don’t have the support and assistance of the military, which means no Form 112 and often a lot more difficulty in finding the witness and getting him to hold still for questioning. In cases of civilian witnesses, we sometimes ask the assistance of other military agencies in making a fast check on the citizen’s local standing as to reliability and so forth, to try to rule out any possible practical jokers or otherwise doubtful sources of information.
