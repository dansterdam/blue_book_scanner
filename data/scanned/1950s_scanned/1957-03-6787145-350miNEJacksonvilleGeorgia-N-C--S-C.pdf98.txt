Mr. Gracia Calero

Sunnyside, Long Island City, N. Y.

Dear Madam:

PAWA records indicated that you were a passenger aboard a PAWA Douglas DC-6A aircraft, No. 52500C, flight 257 from New York, N. Y. to San Juan, P. R. on March 9-1957, and that was involved in an accident at 4:30 AM.

The Civil Aeronautics Board is conducting an investigation of this accident, and it will be appreciated if you will submit a written statement on the back of this letter, to include the following:
(1) Your personal observations of any occurrences while on board which might have appeared unusual to you, prior to and during the accident.
(2) Any observations of movement or actions by the crew which might be helpful in determining the cause of the accident.

The Civil Aeronautics Board, a Federal agency, is charged by an act of Congress with the investigation of accidents involving civil aircraft and your statement is necessary in order that the Board might have the benefit of your observations in conducting the investigation.

A Government postage-free envelope, addressed to the appropriate regional office of the Civil Aeronautics Board, is enclosed for convenience in returning your statement.
