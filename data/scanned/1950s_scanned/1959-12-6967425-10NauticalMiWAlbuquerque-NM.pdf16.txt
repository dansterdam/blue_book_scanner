The image contains a photograph of a star chart showing the constellation Orion. The text in the image discusses the visibility of the Orion constellation and its observable features, such as the interesting "eclipsing variable" star Algol.

ORION VISIBLE
Finest of our bright first magnitude stars is seen in the sky nightly. Also observable is the interesting double "eclipsing variable" star, Algol, in the constellation of Perseus.
BY JAMES STOKLEY
NO NAKED-EYE planets appear in the evening sky during January, although the Zodiac signs indicate that Jupiter is well placed in the west, but its low position is not very noticeable. The display of the stars, however, is fine.
The stars are shown on the accompanying chart, which is drawn to represent the sky as it appears at about 9 p.m. During the month they will appear in somewhat different positions at various hours, but the relative positions of the constellations shown will be maintained. Orion, which stands in the southeast, dominates the scene, and you can hardly mistake it.
Above and to the left of the belt you see the corresponding nebulosity, called the Orion Nebula. It appears as a hazy patch to the naked eye, but a telescope will reveal it as a magnificent star-forming region.
To the right of the belt you see the variable star Algol, which is called the "Demon" star. It shows changes in brightness from the normal second magnitude to about the fourth magnitude in the course of about 2 1/2 days.
