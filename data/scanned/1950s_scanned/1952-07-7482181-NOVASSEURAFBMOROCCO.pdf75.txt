"With reference to the mysterious "Flying Saucer" which was said to have appeared in the sky over Nouasseur AFB, Morocco, on 14 Jul 52, the following information is furnished:

There was a strong consensus among the officers who saw this object that it was indeed real and one of the most bizarre phenomena they had ever witnessed. Their descriptions of the object were fairly consistent, indicating they all saw the same thing.

The object was described as a large, glowing, slightly elliptical body, estimated to be about 60 feet in diameter, which moved with a very high rate of speed and appeared to be under intelligent control. It was observed to make abrupt changes in direction and altitude, and to accelerate rapidly when departing the area.

The object was sighted by several officers, including the base commander, and was tracked on radar for a period of approximately 15 minutes. Radar plot indicated the object was traveling at a speed estimated to be in excess of 1,800 mph. 

...No satisfactory explanation has been found for this incident. The object did not resemble any known aircraft, either manned or unmanned, and its performance characteristics were quite beyond the capabilities of any aeronautical vehicle presently in existence."
