THE KINROSS INCIDENT

This incident was not reported to ATIC as a UFO sighting and therefore we have no case file. Due to the great amount of public interest in this incident ATIC contacted the Flying Safety Division at Norton AFB, California for information pertaining to this aircraft accident. It was determined from Norton AFB that the F-89 was scrambled to intercept an unidentified aircraft which was successfully accomplished. The aircraft was reported in as a Dakota (Canadian CL-47). From the time that the F-89 started to return to base nothing of what happened is definitely known. It is presumed by the officials at Norton AFB that the pilot probably suffered from vertigo and crashed into the lake. The wreckage has never been recovered. This case is carried in Air Force Aircraft Accident Records.
