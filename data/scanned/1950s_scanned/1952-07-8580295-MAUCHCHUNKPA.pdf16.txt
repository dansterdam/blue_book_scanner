The object was called to my attention by Mr. [redacted] as I was putting my car in the garage. It was located in the SW near Mt. [redacted] and remained in that position for about 15 minutes. It appeared to be circular in shape, silvery in color, and positively motionless. In relation to stationary objects, I viewed it with the naked eye and with binoculars.
I pointed it out to my father and sister on reaching home about 150 feet from where I first saw it. About 15 minutes after leaving him the object moved some distance east of a bright red to a bright green, blinking constantly. I decided to go where my father was and to wait until he arrived home in checking our observations agreed that it was changing in size like a pulsing neon light, that it was impossible to estimate its size. We tried repeatedly to estimate the distance but again and again concluded it was impossibly far away, perhaps 5 to 10 miles. The object continued growing smaller until last from view.
The object was very easy to find in the sky even after moving to other positions to study it.
