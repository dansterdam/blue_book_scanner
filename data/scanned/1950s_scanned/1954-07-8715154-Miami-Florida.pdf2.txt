Memorandum
From: BROWN, M. J., LT., USN
To: Office of Naval Research, U.S. Naval Base, Key West, Florida
Subject: Unidentified Flying Object; report of
Date: 0330 - 29 July 1954
Witnessed by: MSGT. JOHN C. HILL, USN
Location: Position of VTB-543: 4 miles, bearing 107° from Conch Airfield Lighted beacon in the Florida Keys. 
General Situation: Aboard USS VTB-543 with tow enroute Miami, Florida, to Key West, Florida.
While making a southward passage on 209° true and 6.5 knots through a choppy sea, 3 miles off of the Florida Keys, on the night of 29 July 1954, the personnel on watch observed a strange luminous object in the sky which appeared to be approximately 30 to 35 miles from their position. The object was observed to be moving along the contour of the Florida Keys in an erratic pattern, and at times it would appear to pause in its flight, then resume at an extremely rapid rate of speed. The personnel on watch immediately alerted the navigational watch, and all hands proceeded to the weather deck to observe the phenomenon. Through the use of binoculars, it was noted that the object was a spherical, luminous white and yellow in color, and was estimating its size to be approximately 3 to 4 feet in diameter. The object remained in view for approximately 5 to 7 minutes, after which it accelerated rapidly toward the east and disappeared from view. This same type object was observed in the same general area several times during the course of the evening.
