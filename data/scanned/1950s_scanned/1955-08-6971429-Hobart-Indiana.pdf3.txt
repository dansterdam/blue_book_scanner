Scientist in charge of outer space objects:

Dear Sir--

On 1955-Aug 22 about 11 A.M., we in our neighborhood saw a ball-silver oval bright in the sky. It could not have been a plane, for there was no sign of wings or tail with it.
Its movement was with no noise and moved very slow and disappeared in a chair and moved only as it as they could not move I Then when I was firmly traced and again contacted the object, this is what I saw and why I could not help it was view before, messieurs. I marked 7 x 3/4 7 x 10.
