12. Major John P. Daly, Jr., Group Intelligence Officer:
I interviewed these men later on this same day. I understand they had been discussing sightings of "flying saucers" and related objects just prior to my arrival. These objects were the subject of much discussion in this office.  As I entered, they made no reference to this duty before during these hours and are not now related to this sighting in any way.  Their reliability must be attached to their sightings.
