There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report document, containing a series of questions and instructions related to reporting and analyzing sightings of unidentified objects.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. 2 x 3' 2" = 6' 1" long

a. Head of a pin, b. Pea, c. Dime, d. Nickel, e. Quarter, f. Half dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22): Certain, Fairly certain, Not very sure

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Gradually faded from sight

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a facsimile or creation of the object which you saw, as it would appear to be the same appearance as the object which you saw.
