Between the big TITLE and the NOTES, there is text that discusses the objectives of the project. There appears to be a requirement for the project objectives to become familiar with new responsibilities and a new method of operation. 

The text also mentions the direct association between the intelligence community and the UFO project, stating that this program should not be burdened with this task as it has such strong communistic implications. It suggests that this program could lead to a positive exposure of the UFO phenomena to the public, which could strip it of its aura of mystery.

Finally, the text discusses the conclusion, stating that the assignment of the UFO project to an agency with scientific capability is logical, and experience has shown that intelligence agencies should utilize this program to enhance the success of the assignment.
