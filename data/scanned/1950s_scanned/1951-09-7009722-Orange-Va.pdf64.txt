I. It was clearly, object was circular, whether like a plate or like a ball, sometimes circular, sometimes oval, sometimes horizontal, sometimes vertical, could not always make out the details encased by a blue haze or mist, when it moved the haze trailed behind.

II. It gave off a bright glow and seemed to travel at a high speed, a short distance suddenly when it did stop, at times became very hard to see, although one could see a person would have heard even pistol-trained plane at the distance it seemed to be free up. It could have flown so fast in answer to the speed at which it traveled. 

III. From the top of the 50 ft. silo on which we were standing it seemed to be about 8 to 10 miles away. (About 5 miles southwest of Orange, Va). It appeared to be a luminous orange object or several objects 3 or 4 feet in diameter in an area of about 1/4 square.

The three who saw it were 15 years old. We are telling only what we are sure we are, and what we have written above is exactly what saw."
