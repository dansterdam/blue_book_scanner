Expected, of course, since it was in that year that the phenomena
first leaped into the public consciousness; during July and August
of that year after Mr. Arnold's incident in June, everybody in the
Northwest of the U. S., it seems, saw something similar. In 1948
the sightings were moving eastward, and were quite scattered --
that year gives us less of an indication of pattern than any other.
In 1949, late in the year, and in the early part of 1950, a con-
centration began to show up in the Southwest. Virtually all of the
indications in this area that you see on the map were put there in
late 1949 and early 1950. There's a reason for this, which I will come
to in a moment. In 1951 no outstanding pattern is observable, the
only things of note being a continuation of the eastward movement
and an increase of concentrations near centers of population. Also,
during 1951 the Middle-western section of the country began to produce
a greater number of sightings than previously. It is of course yet
too early in 1952 for any pattern to have been established.
