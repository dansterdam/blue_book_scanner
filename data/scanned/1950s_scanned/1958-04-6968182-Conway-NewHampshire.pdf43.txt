SUMMARY (Observers, which amplified the salient factors of narrative report. Begin narrative that on 19 Force Item ground?)

On 19 April at 1925Z, the crew of P-47D 52-0050, Capt. H.T. Stanka aircraft Commander, observed a silver object in the sky above them. The altitude of the P-47 was 32,000 and excellent VFR conditions existed.

At first, all crew members thought object to be a balloon, but object did not disappear as rapidly as expected. The object was definitely an artificial/25 kts/40 and closely circled the P-47 for approximately 8 minutes. 

This observation took place between Syracuse, N.Y. and about 20 miles southwest of Plattsburgh Air Force Base, New York.
