It must be noted that this station is within the immediate vicinity of Selfridge AFB, Michigan, and the objects observed had characteristics which might be confused with aircraft that might be observed in that vicinity. It should also be noted that the speed does not concur with the length of sight as an aircraft or object moving at that speed would disappear from view in less than 30 seconds.

The weather conditions at the sighting were clear, visibility 15 miles; surface wind, 5 knots north northwest; and the upper wind was 25 to 30 knots north-northwest.

As stated in paragraph 8, it is estimated possibly that the object involved was a standard aircraft traveling at some distance and at about the same time jet aircraft traveling at some distance and with the sound of landing aircraft, could thus appear to be moving without trail or visible means of propulsion.

There is no physical evidence such as photographs, etc.
No interception or identification action was taken.

The statement of W/2c Oger, one of the observers, is attached, and W/2c Hamm's statement will be forwarded at a later date as airmen in on pass at present time.
