The image shows a sketch or illustration of what appears to be a bird of prey, possibly an eagle, with its wings outstretched. There is also some text below the image, which appears to be a report or description of a "strange object seen moving in the sky" on July 10, 1959. The report mentions that the object was observed moving from West to South-Southeast and that the witness was unable to calculate its speed.

Transcribed text from the document:

July 10, 1959 -

I have not yet attempted to calculate the speeds required to explain this sighting but will be pleased to assist in any way if you are unable to explain singly through your office.

Trusting this information is of some interest,

Strange object seen moving
in the sky

A bright object was seen by Captain E. J. Collins moving from West to South-Southwest last night about 10:00 p.m. The object was 40 to 50 feet long, as near as could be judged, and was bright, looking like a searchlight. It appeared to be some distance away and was moving very fast. The object was observed for approximately 1 minute.
