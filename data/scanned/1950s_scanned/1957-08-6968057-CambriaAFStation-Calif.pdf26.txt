Thank you for your information.

While we would like to be of greater assistance in this matter, it appears that the information provided, and the nature of the incident reported, do not justify further inquiry or investigation by the Air Force or other government agencies. 

Also, we would like to know if you had any photos or other graphic material related to the cause of the unidentified objects described. If such photos or graphic material were obtained, we would be interested in receiving them for analysis. However, in the absence of such supplementary evidence, we are unable to attach a high degree of significance to the incident as reported.

I regret that we cannot be of more assistance. Please feel free to submit any additional information you may obtain.

Thank you for your cooperation.

CECIL E. TAYLOR
Colonel, USAF
Chief, Aerial Phenomena Branch
