I don't see a photograph in this document. This appears to be an Air Intelligence Information Report that describes an unidentified flying object observed by an AFSC radar operator. The text in the report is as follows:

AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
IR-25-52
1. ATILLO, F/SAF
2. After this object disappeared from the high beam scope, private Hannigan went back to the scope and again received an echo on a bearing of 355 degrees, elevation 2 degrees, range 30 miles approximately. The echo was picked up 4 times and it was stated that it was brighter than the average echo and that the object was traveling at very high speed. The radar operator placed these echoes at altitudes between 35,000 and 40,000 feet. He estimated the speed at 600 to 700 miles per hour. This radar operator is considered by this headquarters to be very reliable and thoroughly experienced in the operation of this radar set.
3. The PPT low beam long range scope was operating on a range from 10 to 120 miles when the sighting occurred. The indicating speed controls were essentially the same as for the high beam scope. The controller states the target operated above the terrain on this scope and that air traffic had been previously tracking.
4. The objects ground speed is estimated at 1,500 miles per hour during the first minute of detection. The velocity of this estimate is based on the controller's statement that the object disappeared within one minute from the scope. He has written record of the time of detection as 0122 hours. Investigation reveals that the exact time of disappearance was 0123 hours, which indicates a ground speed of approximately 1,500 miles per hour.
5. In addition to the two radar operators, S/Sgt. O'Keefe, AACS, also saw the radar echo of this unidentified object. He was looking at the same scope when the object appeared. He stated he could not identify the object but that it appeared as a very bright stationary target.
