AIR INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION RECORD
TO: AIR TECHNICAL INFORMATION REPORT NUMBER
15 OCT 53
DATA: MONTEVIDEO, URUGUAY
THE CREDIBILITY, RELIABILITY AND USABILITY OF THIS REPORT IS QUESTIONABLE. THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED IN THIS REPORT IS LIMITED, HOWEVER, THE FACTS WHICH ARE INCLUDED APPEAR VERY STRONGLY TO VERIFY THE OBJECT SIGHTED BY THE VARIOUS WITNESSES, BEING A FIREBALL. A FIREBALL IS A METEOR OF UNUSUAL SIZE AND BRILLIANCE (BRIGHTER THAN 3 MAGNITUDE). ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC OF FIREBALLS CONSISTENT WITH THE OBJECT IS THE POSSIBILITY OF COLOR CHANGE DUR ING FLIGHT, WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, ORANGE, RED, YELLOW, PINK AND PURPLE BEING THE NORMAL COLOR RANGE. FIREBALLS ARE RARE IN OCCURRENCE AND FOLLOW NO SET PATTERN. IT IS UNUSUAL FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO SEE MORE THAN ONE OR TWO IN A LIFETIME. THE FACT THAT A MISSILE OPERATION WAS IN PROGRESS FOR THE OBSERVER ACCOUNTS FOR THEIR STARTING REPORT. THE LIMITED INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT MAKES THE VARIOUS CASE UNEXPLAINABLE. IT IS BELIEVED THAT WERE ADDITIONAL DATA AVAILABLE A SUITABLE EXPLANATION COULD BE MADE.
CONCLUSION - THE WITNESSES IN ALL INSTANCES, EXCEPT POSSIBLY THE BARRIOS' 4320 SIGHTING, OBSERVED A FIREBALL.
