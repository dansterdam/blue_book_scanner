The handwritten text states:

"On the night of 5 Nov around 9.15 p.m. CST, two objects were observed between the witness and the South Star. They came in from the NW and passed over the witness on an apparent track of SE to NW traveling at an extremely fast rate. They appeared to be round and were glowing with a intense whitish light. As the came within 20 degrees of the witness position, the light became abruptly dimmer. They were observed for about 10 seconds and then appeared to slow down and pass from sight. The objects appeared to be almost directly over the witness position at their closest approach and were estimated to be at a high altitude, perhaps in excess of 20,000 feet."
