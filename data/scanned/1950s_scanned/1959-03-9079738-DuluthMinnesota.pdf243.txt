COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:

In the opinion of the preparing officer, there were a number of radar contacts made during the period of time which may or may not be related to each other.

On the basis of the obtained information, it is believed that these electronic signities show a relationship to the reported sightings, but do not necessarily account for the presence of any unidentified flying objects which might have been observed.

There is a remote possibility that the radar siguals may in the minds of the observers have been mistaken for the brightly illuminated objects that were reported. This factor cannot, however, account for all of the electronic sightings. 

Certain during the period of time a number of aircraft were operating in the area, including unreported Air Force operations in the area at the time.

Regarding visual sightings of contrails in the sighting area, these signities may have been contrails from aircraft, but liquid reported that several aircraft were producing contrails (the liquid reported that aircraft were producing contrails).
