WHY UAO reports, in all their varied, strange, and sometimes wildly extravagant forms should have poured in on the ultra-conservative TIMES (whose 'Undermines'?) is a mystery as shell-shocking as that of the UAOs themselves. The serious treatment the TIMES gave these reports, however, is gratifying to look back on, since, in the 1950s, they must have been even more incredibleâ€”seeming than they are in today's age of supersonic flight, radar contact with the moon, and atomic fission.

Here are some selected questions from these UAO reports:

"Where they shone with a bright flickering light until about 10 o'clock, when they moved, making a slight curve westward. The speed with which they migrated was prodigious." (1948).

" ... a most extraordinary appearance in the sky this evening, which has quite frightened the superstitious here. At 7:30 a brilliant and light appeared to the south by east, about half-way between the zenith and horizon ... its shape was oblong ... in about 15 minutes it rose to the zenith." (1839).

"This (to me) extraordinary object ... floated steadily away, northwest by north ... threw no rays in any direction ... and was in my sight, from first to last, about three minutes." (1867).

"A falling star would never have remained so long visible in the telescopic field." (1870).

The so-called "Aurora Beam" of November 17th, 1882," was the subject of a 20-page article in The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, and one of the 26 observers of this remarkable phenomenon.
