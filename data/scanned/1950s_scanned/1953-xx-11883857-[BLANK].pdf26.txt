                           AIRCRAFT

1.    Shape: From conventional to circular or elliptical.

2.    Size: Pinpoint to actual.

3.    Color: Silver to bright yellow (night - black or color of lights).
              Jet exhaust yellow to red. Under certain conditions
              aircraft too far distant to be visible to the naked eye,
              will reflect sunlight from wings or fuselage.

4.    Speed: Generally only angular speeds can be observed. This depends
               on distance but small objects crossing major portion of sky
               in less than a minute can be ruled out. Aircraft will not
               cross major portion of sky in less than a minute whereas
               a meteor certainly will.

5.    Formation: Two to twenty. Numbers greater than 20 more likely
                         birds than aircraft.

6.    Trails: May or may not have (vapor and exhaust).

7.    Sound: Zero to loud shrill or low depending on altitude and
                 winds aloft. Under certain conditions, aircraft may be
                 observed at high altitudes, without making any sound.

8.    Course: Steady, straight or gently curving (not erratic - may
                  appear still if approaching head-on). Right angle turns
                  and sudden reversals, abrupt changes in altitude ruled out.

9.    Time in Sight: More than 15 seconds, generally of the order of a
                             minute or two.

10. Lighting Conditions: Night or Day.
