THIS IS THE STORY OF MY CONNECTION WITH THE "SPACE SHIP" THAT DESCENDED ON THE VIRGINIA GRAHAM FARM...LOCATED ABOUT SIX MILES FROM THE TOWN IN WHICH I LIVE...HOPKINSVILLE, KY. ACTUALLY, EVERYTHING THAT YOU READ FROM HERE ON IS SECOND HAND...HOWEVER IT'S THE BEST INFORMATION THAT I COULD OBTAIN IN THE WORLD...IT COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE L.PS OF THE SEVEN ADULTS INVOLVED. THESE SAME SEVEN THAT I REFER TO...LIVED THROUGH A VERY HARROWING NIGHT...AND FROM WHAT I CAN DETERMINE...A NIGHT THAT THEY WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE REPEATED. TO THE BEST OF EVERYBODY'S KNOWLEDGE...IT STARTED AROUND SEVEN-THIRTY OR EIGHT-O'CLOCK ON THE SUNDAY NIGHT OF AUGUST 21, 1955.

I WAS A VISITOR TO THE GRAHAM HOUSEHOLD WHOM CHARLESTOS A. WEST VIRGINIA, GRANGER WATER FROM A WELL IN THE REAR OF THE ONE STORY BUILDING. AS HE WAS BRINGING THE BUCKET UP, HE SAW A RED OBJECT IN THE SKY TRAILING AN EXHAUST WHICH HAD ALL THE COLORS IN THE RAINBOW. THE OBJECT CAME FROM THE WEST...PASSED ACROSS THE RESIDENCE, AND PROCEEDED DOWN INTO THE FIELD BEHIND THE SUTTON HOUSEHOLD. IT SEEMED TO SLOW DOWN...COME TO A HALT, AND DROPPED VERTICALLY TO THE GROUND DISAPPEARING WITH A SOUND LIKE "POOF" OF THE FIELD BEHIND THE HOUSE HAS A GULLY ABOUT 200 YARDS DEEP WHEN A WALLS AWAY TO THE BOTTOM OF A GULLY ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE HOUSE. THE OBJECT DROPPED BEHIND THIS RISE WHEN IT LANDED, AND TO THIS DATE THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE OR TRACE OF IT'S EXACT POSITION. IN THAT GENERAL DIRECTION...THE FIELD IS BOUNDED ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT WITH TREES...AND I MADE AN EXTENSIVE SEARCH INTO TO THE WOODS ON BOTH SIDES...PENETRATING PER ABOUT 50 YARDS...BUT FOUND NOTHING. THE FIELD WAS SEARCHED COMPLETELY ALSO...,HOWEVER ANY SORT OF IMPRESSION IN FLAT CLAY-LIKE GROUND WOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER DIFFICULT TO MAKE...AS THE WEATHER HAD BEEN HOT AND RAINLESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.
