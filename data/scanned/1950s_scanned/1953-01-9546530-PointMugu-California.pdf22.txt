Here is the extracted text from the document:

```
The general appearance of this object was a white flat disk approximately 
eighteen to twenty inches in diameter. However, its size might be larger 
as I had no way of checking its altitude other than it seemed well above 
the mountains adjacent to Mugu Rock. The shimmering outline could be 
compared to observing the moon on a bright sunny day, except there were 
no dark marks anywhere on this object. 

It is our custom to report any craft not authorized in the launching area 
and to note the time they appear. I called Erskine P.C. at 1300 and in-
quired if he could confirm what I had seen after I described it to him. 
It is quite probable that whoever received my transmission did not under-
stand what I was talking about or at least thought I was pressure happy. 
He informed me our services were no longer needed on the sea test range 
and that we were to return to port. 

When I arrived in port, I called Lt. Commander Wauer by land line and 
made the same report. He subsequently instructed us to make this 
written description. 

It is quite probable that there will be some doubt as to the accuracy of 
this report, but I can only say I have been observing the flight of planes 
and missiles at M.I.C. since 1949 and have some knowledge of their character-
istics and speeds. I have never seen any plane or missile which resembled 
this object nor came within one half its speed.
