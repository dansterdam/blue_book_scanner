1. A&IC comment based on its review and analysis of film strip. Submitted for any suggested reply to Mr. Matheson to whom it was referred from Ottawa.
2. Briefly our findings:
a. The film appears to cover late summer, autumn and winter all on one strip, from the scenes shown which ranged from full foliage of trees to three (3) inches of snow.
b. The object definitely appears to be the moon, and is preceded immediately by a bright object or three (3) objects manoeuvring in a series around it.
c. Observer could not give the exact date of the sighting, except that it was sometime in December. The incident occurred December 2 - 10, 1955.
d. We are puzzled by the fact that although directions, locations or estimates given do not conform to the official letter (copy attached, dated 8 Apr 55) and in five (5) separate spaces (Questions 1, 2, 3, 4) no answer was given.
e. Check with radar units and GOC posts that seems to be area 26 hours gap on the report, including military and civilian. The periods show two (2) observations per period of the general date given.
f. However, bOnus are so bright during the assumed period of the report that newspapers and science journals commented on it. (Copies are attached to the enclosures and seem to be too large for Venus).
3. We cannot comment on any probable motives on the part of the observer in submitting a film on what appears to be a picture of the moon, over four months after the incident took place.
4. Original film for return to Mr. Matheson is attached.
