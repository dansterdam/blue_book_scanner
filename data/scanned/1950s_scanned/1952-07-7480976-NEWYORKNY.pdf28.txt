There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image shows a page of text from what seems to be a Project Blue Book document or report.

Here is the text extracted from the image:

"It was a Long Blue Streak.
Passing, flying over, it was the south, went long, blue streak. It happened like 25 minutes and then disappeared. The thing was seen from the mountain near city. We see little light but we could not see anything. Then after the mountains, the streak came again and again but we could not see anything, just the streak and illuminated the sky.
The man called up the communications man in the area and said he had no telephone calls from any place and no reports of airplanes being down in the area, when the Blue Streak appeared. The Blue Streaks were seen at 2146 and disappeared in a few seconds."
