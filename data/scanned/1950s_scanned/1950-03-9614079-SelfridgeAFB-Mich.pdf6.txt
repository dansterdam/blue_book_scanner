The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a page from an old UFO report document. The text in the document has been obscured, likely for security or classification reasons. However, I can attempt to extract and output the text that is visible:

the target tounded in one location and also in the proximate from a position of observation from 35.53 miles at 33 the same altitude. in I minutes, this change in position brought it 5.53 miles nearer the observation point. The time was not precisely measured, but the times were not to very long, probably not exceeding 2 minutes.

This was apparently unexplained and the device was reported as unidentified during this run. Subsequent individual questions: I unnoticed with questions to it during this run. I know only that the target was very fast. It disappeared during this period. I have several guesses as to what the object conceivably could have been, but observed that losing and gaining up to 20,000 feet very rapidly.

I was also at 2046 BST, to identify this aircraft on my type ( (3723-95) and automatically on the ZN 4855. The only actual siting and height we took on this aircraft. I did during the six minuets from 2046 to 2052 , give indications on both scopes without fade. I took down the angles and altitlides, but I had no dial readings. But those times were definitely marked and noted, but in this case. due to the fact that we were both following this same targets I have reconstructed what times were taken in cream pencil directly on the scops head, and later transferred as follows:

TIME AZITUTH RANGE IN MILES ALTITUDE IN FEET
2046 180 25,000
2047 180 29,000
2048 140 35,000
2049 125 32,000
2050 133 33,000
2051 133 33,000
2052 133 39,000

These figures, though not spectacular as the altitude changes and speed must have been above 2000 knots and speeds I do not beiieve capable of the aircraft then in the air.

AT the instant of the drawing the target moved in a direct straight line but as I observed it, it seemed to be climbing and diving with purpose,
