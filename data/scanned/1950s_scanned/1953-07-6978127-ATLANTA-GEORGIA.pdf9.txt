Monkey-Hoaxer Pays a $40 Fine; Sun Valley Any What Were Fooled
KATHARINE BARNWELL, the feisty Atlanta fighter who posed as a space visitor - and cost the state $150 in useless searches - was fined $40 in Fulton County recorder's court Tuesday. She pleaded guilty to charges of disorderly conduct and using loud and profane language.
BARBER ADMITS HOAX
Testifying, she admitted she hadn't come from outer space after all. The girl, who only recently emerged as the Athena of this region, said she was kidding when she said she was from Venus. The space mystery solved, the court assessed the $40 fine and then dismissed the charge. Walnuts thinks the judge was pretty lenient on her, considering the cost of the whole incident. 
Hoax Ends In Health Fine of $40
The girl appeared in court Tuesday night, where she pleaded guilty to the same charges and was fined $40.
"ARE you that?", he questioned. 
"Yes, sir, that's me," she replied.
"Well, I'm going to give you a $40 fine for disorderly conduct - that's all I can do," the judge said. Miss Barnwell thanked him and left the courtroom, apparently relieved that the incident was over.
