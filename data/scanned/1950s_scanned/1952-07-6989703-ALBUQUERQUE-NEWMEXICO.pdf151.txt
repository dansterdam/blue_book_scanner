CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER
"Flying Saucer" Film Elusive, Too
By WILSON HIRSCHFELD
This is a photograph of a "flying saucer" which was filmed by a television station in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 31, 1952, according to Ralph G. Mayher, who says he was responsible for the film.
Mayher, a television cameraman, says he was filming a thunderstorm on that date when the strange aerial object suddenly appeared in the sky. He continued filming, obtaining the images shown here, before the object disappeared.
The film is said to be the property of the television station which employed Mayher at the time. Though often requested to do so, Mayher has steadfastly refused to disclose the identity of the station, explaining that he is bound by a pledge of secrecy.
A former official of the U.S. Air Force, who was present when the film was first viewed, is quoted as saying that the object "cannot be identified as any known aircraft." The film has been analyzed by several experts, who also report that they are unable to explain the nature of the object.
Though many inquiries have been made, the custodians of the film have consistently declined to make it available for public viewing. Mayher says he has received numerous offers for the film, but has always refused to consider a sale.
"I'll never show it again," he says. "I am through with it." Mayher, who says he has had other unusual sightings, believes the film record of this "flying saucer" will remain a mystery.
