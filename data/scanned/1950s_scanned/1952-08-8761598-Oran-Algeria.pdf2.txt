LUMINOUS OBJECTS SEEN OVER ALGERIA -- ORAN, ORAN REPUBLICAIN, 16 AUG 52

In Ain Sefra, on the night of 12 August 1952, a railroad agent observed a ball of fire suddenly appearing against a background of clouds, racing across the sky from east to west and driving behind a luminous pink trail. Apparently the object stopped and then started to drop, and it seemed to explode, but the observer did not hear any noise.
