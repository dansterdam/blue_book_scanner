The following is a reoort of T/Sgt. Robert L, Stevens, U.S.A.A.F., Lowry Flight Service Center, Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Colorado:

On 22 September 1950 at approximatley 1800 hours, I observed an unidentified flying object in the sky over Denver, Colorado. The object, which appeared to be circular in shape, was hovering at an altitude estimated to be between 8,000 and 10,000 feet. The color of the object was described as a phosphorescent white. The object remained in the same area for approximately 7 to 10 minutes, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared at a high rate of speed. No sound was heard from the object.

Capt. McFadden, Flight Officer Hanson, of United Air Lines, Denver, Colorado, also observed the same object at the same time and location. Capt. McFadden estimated the size of the object to be approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter.

The incident was reported to the 2600 Observation Squadron, Denver, Colorado. However, no further information or investigation was conducted by the Air Force.
