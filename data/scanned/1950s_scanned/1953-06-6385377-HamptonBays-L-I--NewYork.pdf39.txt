Flying Saucers or Not? Canada's Sighting Station to Seek Scientific Proof
ON THE LOOKOUT FOR FLYING SAUCERS?
Ottawa, Nov. 16. - A station is being constructed by Canadian electronic engineers at Shirley's Bay, near Ottawa, to train the scanning devices of a telescope and a camera on any flying saucer sightings in the area. 
According to the report, the station is being set up to determine whether the objects, which are said to be powered by electromagnetic propulsion, are real. The station will be manned 24 hours a day, and it will monitor radio signals at 530 kilocycles to pick up any radio interference that could be linked to the flying saucers. The report states that when the station is completed, it will be manned 24 hours a day, and it will monitor radio signals at 530 kilocycles to pick up any radio interference that could be linked to the flying saucers.
