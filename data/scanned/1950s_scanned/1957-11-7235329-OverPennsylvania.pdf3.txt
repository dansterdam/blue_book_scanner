An unidentified flying object was reportedly observed over Pennsylvania on November 7, 1957. According to the report, the object was sighted by a private pilot, who described it as a strange metallic object hovering at a high altitude. The pilot stated that the object was approximately 50-100 feet in diameter and was observed for several minutes before it accelerated and disappeared from sight. The report includes the pilot's sketch of the object, which shows a circular, metallic-looking craft. The case was investigated by the U.S. Air Force as part of Project Blue Book, but no definitive conclusion was reached about the nature of the object.
