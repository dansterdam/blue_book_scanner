The image contains two photographs. The first photograph on the left appears to show the profile or silhouette of a disc-shaped object, which the caption refers to as "O PERFIL DO DISCO VOADOR" or "The profile of the flying disc". 

The second photograph on the right depicts what the caption describes as "A PARTE INFERIOR DO MISTERIOSO APARELHO" or "The lower part of the mysterious device".

As an OCR system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

O PERFIL DO DISCO VOADOR.
A PARTE INFERIOR DO MISTERIOSO APARELHO.
