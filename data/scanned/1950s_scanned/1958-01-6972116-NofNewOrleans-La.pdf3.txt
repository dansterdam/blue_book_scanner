Received following message from Capt. Gregory by phone.

"Urgent Matter - Regarding Senator Lydon Johnson. Washington querying us regarding a letter from this center, we of course had no knowledge of such.

Letter regards a case which the source repeated to the OSI, FBI, and to senator. 

Major Connair states we must get it out by this afternoon in accordance with DOD directives. Urgent matter and I have just finished the computation, however,

I do not feel we have time to put it in final form in probabilities that it may not be approved by your office. I have it in draft form and I should like to see you as soon as possible regarding it's review and your approval."
