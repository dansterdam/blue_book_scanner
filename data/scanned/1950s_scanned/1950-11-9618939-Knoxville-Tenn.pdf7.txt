SUMMARY OF INFORMATION UNCLASSIFIED
PREPARING OFFICE: AEC, FAO #6, P. 0. Box 376, Knoxville, Tennessee
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS ON RADAR SCOPES - THE KNOXVILLE TYSON AIRPORT, KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:

The Weather Division at the Oak Ridge Atomic Energy Commission reports the following concerning the weather during the above period:

The temperature at this time (1600 hours on 29 November 1950) was 52 degrees at the surface, 50 degrees at 1,500 feet and 27 degrees at 10,000 feet (1900 feet mean sea level).

The possibility that the Geiger counters in the "restricted areas" are receiving indications from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory plants is projected from the fact that the radioactivity (tolerance is the amount of radioactivity that a human body can withstand without indication) of radioactive materials is much lower than the amount of radioactivity existing at 1/10,000th of what man can withstand indicating the Geiger counters could be ringing from other radioactive masses, such as radori (natural radioactivity) entering the Geiger counters could be the cause (natural radioactivity radiated through the ground under the Geiger counters) found in the "restricted areas" because said radon is a minute concentration measured at 500 feet from the Atomic "stacks".
