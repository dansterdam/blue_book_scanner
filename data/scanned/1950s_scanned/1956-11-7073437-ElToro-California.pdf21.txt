The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a Project Blue Book report titled "AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT". The text in the report is as follows:

COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICERS
1. The preparing officer was unable to arrive at any definite conclusion as to the cause of the sighting. However, since no other radar installations in the area observed these objects and no other visual observations were made, it is possible that some local condition may have caused a malfunction or peculiar performance of the radar.

COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICERS 
1. In the opinion of the Approving Officer, this sighting was caused by anomalous propagation compounded by equipment of the sensors, causing an apparent visual sighting to the radar observers. The following reasons are given for this evaluation:
a. Although the source stated he was familiar with the effects of anomalous propagation, past experience indicates that this phenomenon is often in various forms, all of which are not easily identified.
b. There are many radar sites in the area. Anyone of these could have been causing interference, compounding the effects of anomalous propagation, this making this phenomenon unidentifiable even to trained observers.
c. Although during vectoring operations, ground radar observed the objects on the wing of the interceptor, neither visual nor radar contact was made from the aircraft.
d. It has been noted several times in the history of the UFOB program that background has produced a normal phenomenon and then picked up an object on radar. These two objects are not necessarily the same. It will be noted that the observers saw visualize the fantastic speeds and maneuverability of the objects that were seen on the radar scope.
2. Therefore, an evaluation of "Other" as Anomalous Propagation" is given to this sighting. 
3. The photographs have been sent to ATIC for further analysis.
