Text from the document:

RAILROAD conductors are not excitable peo-
ple. Neither are airline pilots. Yet, the
same night Capts. Grady C. Kelly and
Thomas T. Ballard of Stick Airways watched
the same fireball off the left wing of their DC-3
plane as they approached Midland Field here.

"We both commented at the time that it
was by far the brightest meteor we had seen
in 10 years of flying," Ballard said later.

Elsewhere, a convalescent soldier, Bill Ben-
derson, at Ft. Bayard, N.M., watched the ball
of fire from his hospital window. An observant
12-year-old girl, Livinia Ann Rife, of Santa Fe,
saw it and described it as "rounded,
bluish-green, with an orange-red tail."

Scientists at the Los Alamos Village are display-
ing the fragment and reported on it. So did the Civil Aeronautics
Administration's tower man at Truth and
Consequences, N.M. So did Walter Hirst, of 712
Grace, an experienced observer of meteors.
So did Nathan B. Blue Jacket, a Navajo.

Some newsmen blamed the balls they saw to
faults over at Tularosa, N.M. (which killed
four persons) on such a fireball. Investigation showed
the flash seen at the moment of collapse came
from short-circuited electric lines.

But to all who have seen them, sight of the
great green fireballs flashing through the
heavens is an unforgettable experience. 

"They, like thousands of other Americans
here, have wondered what they are.
No government source knowsâ€”or if any does
know, it isn't saying. That goes for the giant
Atomic Energy Installation at Los Alamos, and
the carefully technicians at Sandia Base
here. The Department of Defense is also mum,
although various intelligence and scientific
agencies of the government have shown an
interest in the fireball mystery.

But one authority will speak.
He is Dr. Lincoln LaPaz, a friendly, intense
scientist of world reputation who is head of
