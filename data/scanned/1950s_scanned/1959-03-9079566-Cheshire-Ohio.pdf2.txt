Tape recording submitted by Mr. XXXXXXXX of UFO sighting by XXXXXX on 17 March 1959.

Witness was walking across Tiger Hill when there was a burst of rain. It rained hard, but by the time he got to the top of the hill the rain stopped. Witness saw a strange light about 50' over a house which frightened him. Witness walked on down the road and saw an object about 50' over the road. The object took off like a shot out of a gun and then stopped. Witness was then ordered by a voice to keep back and about buts then the object was gone. The friend dismissed the object as a reflection. Mr. XXXXXX began walking on home; as he walked around a curve, he saw lights of a house, but to his right, about five to ten feet off the ground, he saw a luminous, oblong, object with a cookie-lit-like arrangement on the top which seemed to be rotating. The color of the object was white like the moon. The object then seemed to move toward the ground. This light struck witness' shoulder. There was no sound. The object took off, then slowed down, then went out of sight over a house.

This story was relayed to Mr. XXXXXX by a Mr. XXXXXX who also sighted an object on 16 March 1959, 2030-2100. While driving home from a service call, Mr. XXXXXX noticed his car radio had static. He instinctively looked up for power lines and noticed an object about 300' up and about 75-100' in front of his car. He saw only the bottom of the object. He also noticed that his lights dimmed. He had the object in sight until he reached his home, where he called his family out to see it. By that time it was leaving at such a fast rate of speed no one could tell much about it.
