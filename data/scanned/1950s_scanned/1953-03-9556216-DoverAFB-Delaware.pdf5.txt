INTELLIGENCE REPORT 1013-3 ACC 6 MARCH 1953
DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, DELAWARE

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object over Dover, Delaware

TO: Detachment Commander
Det 1013-3 ACC
Dover AFB, Del.

1. As approximately 1920 EST the Dover AFB Control Tower received a radio call from a pilot that he had observed a silvery, disc-shaped object over the city of Dover, Delaware. This call was received by the tower operator, pfc Richard Roth. The object was observed by other tower personnel and was described as a silvery, disc-shaped object, approximately 30 feet in diameter. The object was observed to be hovering over the city of Dover for several minutes, then suddenly climb and disappear from view. Pfc Roth attempted to establish radio contact with the object but was unsuccessful. He stated that he could not get the object with the naked eye.

2. At 2130 EST a similar object was spotted by the tower, first as a target on the scope and then visually. I called the Mew Castle Filter Center and requested that an officer check the object. A Lt. (?) officer confirmed that an officer checked the object, but was unable to identify it. The object was lost on scope and could not be regained. No attempt was made to intercept the object with aircraft. The object seemed to remain stationary, then faded out the same as it had appeared. The object was approximately the size of a dime held at arm's length, but seemed to remain in the same place, lacking any definite speed or direction of movement. After the object faded from view, it could not be reacquired on the scope. The tower personnel felt that this was the same or a similar object as had been seen earlier in the evening.

No more objects were spotted or reported the remainder of the night.
