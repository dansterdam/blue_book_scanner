The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document.

I will now act as an OCR system and produce the text found in the document:

13 February 1960

I am returning herewith the negative you forwarded recently for the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center taken at Coburn, Virginia in August 1959.

The Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center analysis of the film is that the spots are "air bella" and that the wispy image is either out-of-focus or due to poor developing techniques. Air bells result from bubbles forming around the film during developing and preventing small areas from being exposed.

For your information, the Air Force does not pay for photographs of UFO's.

Sincerely,
