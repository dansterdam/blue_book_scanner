Dear Sirs:

Although I revisited my records on an alleged U.F.O. sighting from my own observation on November 14, 1958, I find that I have no additional information to contribute to the present UFO study.

I would appreciate an answer to my initial letter, in which I attempted to cooperate to the degree that I was capable. The technical interpretation of the visual phenomenon is beyond my capabilities. 

Yours truly,
