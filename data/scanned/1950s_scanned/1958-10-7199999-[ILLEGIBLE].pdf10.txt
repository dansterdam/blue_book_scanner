There does not appear to be any photograph present in this page from the Project Blue Book UFO report document. 

The text in the document is as follows:

While it was in S.E., a low flying plane flew over the object and banked in such a manner that the observer was able to see the underside of the plane. Although point was taken to calculate the size of the object, distance was so great that it could not be accurately determined. The object made no sound and traveled on a very level course. The speed was moderately fast but did not appear tremendous. The object made no turns and traveled on a straight course. As it passed through occasional "vapors," it belched and got lost in certain areas. Could hardly have been visible for more than 15-20 seconds, but the rays of the sun were such that it was indistinctly visible and could not be observed constantly. It seemed to disappear, reappeared, and disappeared at least 3-4 times and passed through at the rate of approximately 9:30. Could be easily accurate from the relative of the observer.
