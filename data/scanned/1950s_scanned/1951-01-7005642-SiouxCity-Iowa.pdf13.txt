SUBJECT: Report of an unusual aerial object observed by NICAP member, Sioux City, Iowa.
G. Carpenter, a member of NICAP, reported the sighting of an unusual aerial object which was observed in the area of Sioux City, Iowa, on 7 January 1951. The object was first sighted at approximately 7:00 p.m. and was observed for a period of approximately 30 minutes.
The object was described as being globular or circular in shape and was glowing a reddish-orange color. It was estimated to be approximately 30-40 feet in diameter and was observed to be at an altitude of approximately 3,000 feet. The object was reported to make a series of sharp turns and to move in a northeasterly direction at a high rate of speed. No trail or exhaust was observed.
G. Carpenter stated that he had contacted the USAF and had been interviewed by an intelligence officer from the Sioux City Air Force Base. He was requested to submit a written report of his observations. This report, along with any other pertinent information, was forwarded to the Office of Special Investigations at Offutt Air Force Base, Omaha, Nebraska.
1. This case was considered by the Project Blue Book staff and was determined to be a sighting of an unusual aerial object. However, a definite identification could not be made. The object was not identified as any known type of aircraft or other aerial vehicle. Its exact nature and origin remain unknown.
2. No physical evidence of the object was obtained, and the only data available are the observations made by the witness. These observations are considered reliable and there is no reason to doubt the credibility of the witness.
3. Efforts to obtain further information from the witness or other sources have been inconclusive. No additional data is available at this time.
