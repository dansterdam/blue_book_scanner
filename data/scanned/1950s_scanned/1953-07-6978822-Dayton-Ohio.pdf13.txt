The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a report or document, likely related to Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program established in 1952 to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound: Paced, Circling
b. Color: White, very bright, star-like

17. Draw a sketch that will show the shape of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially about trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow to show the direction the object was moving.
They were moving, then hover-craft

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle one):  
a. Sharply outlined 
b. Blurred
c. Like a bright star with haze
d. Don't remember

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
1. They appeared close together (around 2 miles)  
2. Left one shot over past right one
3. Then back to the left again and did some maneuvering and down and up in very rapid steps and left together as they had appeared
