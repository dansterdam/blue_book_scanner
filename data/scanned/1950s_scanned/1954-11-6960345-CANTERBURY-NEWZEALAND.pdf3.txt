Dear [Redacted],

Regarding your inquiry about aircraft movements in the Christchurch area on Sunday, the 21st November, I have to advise that there were 564 movements of aircraft in the Christchurch area. It is possible that any or all of these movements may have been observed.

In view of your interest in flying saucer reports, I would like to advise that on that date a meteorological balloon was released from the Weather Station at Christchurch Airport and may have been seen by you.

Yours faithfully,
[Signature]
STATION AIR TRAFFIC OFFICER
