There does not appear to be any photograph or image in the provided document. The document consists entirely of text describing a UFO sighting incident.

Force Base in Florida said the object, which was no bigger than a plane, but shining like a star, first caught the pilot's attention.

Capt. Van Winkle said he and the co-pilot, Lt. J.W. Connelly, both saw the object, which was approximately 100 feet in diameter, flying along at an estimated 3,500 to 4,000 feet in a few seconds. The witnesses considered the object a very fast, fast-moving automatic device, but could not identify it. 

According to the document, three air force officers, Captain Van Winkle, Lt. J.W. Connelly, and Mrs. Abraham Gifford, a passenger, were hospitalized for treatment after the incident. The document states that the object was "unrecognizable" and that Captain Van Winkle described the sighting as a "bright light" that seemed to change in intensity. The document also mentions a "runaway missile" incident at Washington, Maryland, but states that the department had not received any report on that incident.
