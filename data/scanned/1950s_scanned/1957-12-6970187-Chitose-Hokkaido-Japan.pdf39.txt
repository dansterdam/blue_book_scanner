MEMO ROUTING SLIP

REMARKS: Fn. Cru. Capt. Comment: CApT Toshimoto Nato of 10th Guard plane was flying his plane when he noted Venus hovering almost stationary in the sky. It continued to show color variations from red to blue and was revolving at intervals of 5-10 minutes. This is the first time I have ever seen an identification of VENUS as the object of observer. In analyzing the details it appears quite probable that the unusual display of this planet was seen. The observer is a capable officer in the Ground Controlled Intercept outfit and there seems no reason to doubt his statements.
