George AFB, Calif. - 1, 9, 13, 14, 20 May 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

The sighting on 1 May 1952 at George AFB, Calif., was the first of a series of nine sightings there in a three week period. These sightings were all by military personnel.

a. 1 May 1952 - Five round, disc-shaped objects, flat white in color which gave no glare or reflection were sighted. They were in formation with three in front and two in the rear. The latter two darted around in a circular or zig-zag manner.

b. 9 May 1952, 1030 PDST - An unidentified round, silver object was sighted visually from the ground and from two F-86 aircraft.

c. 9 May 1952, 1230 PDST - Two unidentified objects moving with the current or breeze at a slow speed. They appeared to be a silver metal color with a dark spot in the center and at certain angles to the sun gave off a bright glare.

d. 9 May 1952, 1720 PDST - Object was of dull color like a thundercloud. It was shaped like an arrowhead but had no known aerodynamic features.

e. 11 May 1952, 1220 PDST - Object looked like a white paper plate flipping end over end with an initial speed comparable to a jet although later it reduced its pace.

f. 13 May 1952, 1425 PDST - Single object, appeared round, shiny, metallic which glowed or reflected white or silver was observed for thirty minutes.

g. 14 May 1952, 1405 to 1430 PDST - Same description as object sighted on 13 May and by same sources.

h. 20 May 1952, 1425 PDST - A silver colored, bright, round object was observed for five minutes. Initially the object was stationary but eventually moved and faded away.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

Only balloons released from Edwards AFB can be tracked accurately over George AFB, consequently, for the most part they are the only balloons with which we are concerned. These balloons are released irregularly thus accounting for some of the unusual times of sightings reported in cases which are probably balloons.
