STATEMENT

At approximately 2330 hours, 5 August 1952, while on duty as Controller of Detachment #4, 532nd Aircraft Control & Warning Group, I received a call from Harcida tower operator that they could see a bright light out over Tokyo Bay. Northeast of their station at approximately 1000 to 1500 feet.

I relayed this information to ADCC and started checking for an indication on the radar scope on both high and low beam. There were three (3) or four (4) blips on low beam but none I could definitely get a reading on or none I could get a reading on the HRI scope.

At 2345 hours I was relieved by Lt. Albert.
