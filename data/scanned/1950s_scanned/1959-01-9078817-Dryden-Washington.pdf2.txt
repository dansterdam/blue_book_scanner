The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report.

Here is the text I was able to extract from the document:

I have a flying saucer story to tell you. Last monday i was about 9:20 p.m.
i spotted a large silver object above mt. rainier. it was as bright as a full moon and appeared to be hovering. then it took off at a terrific speed, disappeared in the east. 
when i first sighted it, it appeared to be the size of a silver dollar. at about the same angle a it moved away, it appeared to be about 15 or 18 feet in diameter. it was about 80 to 100 feet above me.
it was no plane or helicopter. first it hovered, then took off at a speed i never saw before. it made no sound at all.
i watched it for about 40 or 45 seconds. then i went to the house, told my wife. she confirms the story.
an east of that: when it went out of sight, i called the authorities in seattle, told them my story. they said they had no reports of any unidentified objects in that area that night. 
when i first saw the object, it seemed to reflect a pulsating light, almost as though it was charging up for a take-off.
