1. This command has reviewed the included report and it is considered that the unidentified targets observed on the nights of 14 and 15 November 1950 appear to be possibly correct.

2. In general, insufficient information is contained in the attached report to allow a well-founded evaluation to be made of the radar targets. It is suspected that the sources of the basic report be requested to submit another more complete and coordinated report. Answers to the following questions are desired:

(1) Did the radar scope pips of the unidentified target detected by the ground radar set resemble those of a conventional aircraft? If so, what type or size conventional aircraft?

(2) Can a track of the unidentified target be supplied to this command? If not, are complete details as possible regarding range and maneuvers of the target, and contiguity of the radar target echoes.

(3) What type ground radar set was used to detect the target? Was the frequency of the transmitter particularly what was the frequency of the transmitters?

(4) What type radar set was used in the intercepting F5F-5N?

(5) Was the F5F-5N that made visual contact with an unidentified airborne object the same as the one that had previously made a radar contact on the unidentified target? Also, was radar contact made on the sighted aircraft either before or after visual sighting by the F5F-5N or the ground radar?
