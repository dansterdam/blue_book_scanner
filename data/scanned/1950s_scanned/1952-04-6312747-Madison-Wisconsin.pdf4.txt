APPENDIX VI

Madison, Wisconsin - 16 April 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT

This incident is cited not so much because it is outstanding but because of the excellent attempt at identifying the object by ADC units.

2015 CST: Civilian telephoned fighter operations of Truax Field to report that he had just sighted a formation of yellowish-white lights traveling at a high rate of speed on a heading of 90Â°.

2020 CST: Fighter operations called AC and W Squadron. The radar was closed down for preventive maintenance but was operational within three minutes. A flight of F-80s were directed to investigate and returned with negative results. A flight of F-86s were sent to 30,000 ft., also returned with negative results.

In addition to the AC and W Squadron Intelligence Officer checked all airline flights and checked two observatories for any unusual astronomical displays. Results were negative.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION

It is possible that the observer saw either the F-80s or F-86s over Madison, since they were in the area, however, the source reported no sounds. The objects were also reported to have turned very sharply and climbed at a high rate of speed. Jet aircraft far enough away not to be heard would normally not appear to make a sharp turn and fast climb.

III. CONCLUSIONS

Source possibly observed jet aircraft in area and the apparent high speed and rate of climb was an illusion.
