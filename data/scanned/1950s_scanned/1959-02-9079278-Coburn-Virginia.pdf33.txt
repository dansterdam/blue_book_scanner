"I had a sighting for a little short while which indicates something taking place and also times. These are some fine friends here who were receiving this letter about June 19, 1959.

I have seen and object 9 times in all as different nights and always it comes with a noise that amazing is not where it is no stillness because it amounts to any weather imaginable apart till it is now. They seem to be a breation in which we of these others have seen to be 50 firms . It show twice in that and told down a 3 bales which the members had already. They are some picture and conversation. These meantime should be returned for ex-amination. I myself, attertance, there is the possibility, but more or less account of the Armed forces being those in done.

Also limited by some evidence which is hard to be released to the public."
