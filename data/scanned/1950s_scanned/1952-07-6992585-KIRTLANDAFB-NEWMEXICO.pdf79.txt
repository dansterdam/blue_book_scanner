(Circle One): Yes or No

29.2 Please list their names and addresses:
I am unable to list their names as They lived across the

same Like, besides a 3-yr-children present.

30. Please add here any further comments which you believe are important.

I feel rather silly answering this particular
but I have decided to tell the G-2 & Air Technical Service Command
Army A.F.B. advised me to make an official report & besides "I
did" I remember no eliminations that were werthy to mention
but I did see an object which I am unable to identify.

My delay in answering were caused by my attendance
at school at Fort Holoberd, Maryland from 9 August-1-December.

The letter you see I titled above and is in my SUBJECT-To
letter, of 1 August of which I presume you have a copy.
