1. Reference is made to confidential message, 3AD-DI C3998/11-10-50, subject: "Report in accordance with Par 2d, letter Hq USAF, subject: Report of Unidentified Aerial Objects dated 6 September 1950".
2. The radar sightings reported in the referenced message are believed to be atmospheric conditions. The shape or signal characteristics or spurious radar echoes are of an indeterminable nature in analyzing the sightings. The signal returning from the objects indicated a pulse length in seconds multiplied by the speed of electrical impulses through space, a pulse of some 100 microseconds (the speed of miles per second of electromagnetic waves through space) would occupy 0.186 miles range. Spurious signals due to weather conditions always occupy more range than signal information and remain a more rapid beating and/or scintillation characteristics than the atmospheric conditions causing spurious micro-wave radar echoes. Abnormal temperature changes with altitude are usually associated with these atmospheric conditions and may be responsible to some extent for the spurious echoes. The SCR-584, like all radar equipment operating on a frequency of about 3,000 megacycles per second, is susceptible to such spurious echoes.
