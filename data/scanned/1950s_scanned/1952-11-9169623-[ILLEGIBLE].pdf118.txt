A/10 @ 1623007, had seen an object identified as a jet plane flying at a high altitude from northeast to southwest and the sun shining on it caused it to be an odd color.

At the same time, observed a jet plane south of Fayetteville at a high altitude giving off a short vapor trail. He said that the trail did not seem to extend behind the plane as usual.

Further information on what is believed to be the same jet aircraft flight, as mentioned above, can be found by referring to Flyobropot 18-OPS CL,332, Commanding.
