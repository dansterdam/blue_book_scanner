The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book, that includes a drawing and some text prompts.

The text found in the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound _________________
b. Color __________________

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc. and especially indicate trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One):   a. Fuzzy or blurred
                   b. Like a bright star 
                   c. Sharply outlined
                   d. Don't remember

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there?
Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.
