The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document describing a reported UFO sighting. The text reads as follows:

blinked intermittently at about one second intervals for about 3 or 4 minutes, then vanished. The object was soundless. No jets in general area during the "hovering" incident.  

Received the following report by telephone from Mr. and Mrs. Donald Koerner, Demar Rd., Indian Hill, Mrs. Krueger was watching TV, she heard a motor or strange sound and called Mr. Krueger's attention to it. They both went to the window and saw the object described in Mrs. Krueger's phone call to the Rangers from that office.

Looking toward Miami and Demar Rd., about a quarter mile from their home, Mrs. Krueger watched a large, glowing, reddish-orange light in the sky. It appeared for intervals, the object had a yellowish center and a nebulous rather than a clear-cut outline and made no sound. Certain that the object was a self-luminous solid device under some one's control. Mr. Krueger said that it twice shifted position, dropping below a line of trees out of sight. Concerned, Mrs. Krueger phoned the Rangers. 

During that sighting, Mr. Krueger watched the object closely. It appeared and disappeared at irregular intervals, as though flickering on and off. Estimated from their location that the object was about 725 ft. On another occasion the body of light shifted slightly from south to north. Mr. Krueger said it remained one final shift south again before it suddenly blinked out and disappeared.

Although no color photographs were taken, Mr. Krueger noted outstanding electrostatic phenomena, a star, jets, helicopter, auto headlights and searchlights. It was something that neither person had ever before seen.

While Herb continued to watch the northeast sky, Mrs. Clark phoned the fire department their latest sighting.

With 10 x 50 binoculars, I went outdoors. Sighted dim red object, about 15 degrees horizon, flying swiftly from the northeast: the identical point where Clark and others had viewed the object hovering. Caught the object briefly in binoculars, it appeared grayish. Unable to maintain the object more than momentary impression that the object was triangular in shape and that in the binoculars the object had a tendency to pulsate or throb in its horizontal southeastward flight. I viewed the object about 4 seconds and traveling slower than the fastest jet observed during the night's activity, the object disappeared downward below the horizon which obscured the activity. The object reappeared momentarily about the same place where I had first looked at the proper elevation for its return, but saw nothing. This indicates that the object had changed its course from S.W. to more E.N.E. During this hour no jets were seen in the area.

(Approx.) Learned the following report from the Indian Hill Ranger Station. May 7 Ranger patrolling on Demar Ave. in Indian Hill reported to his headquarters, having seen a swiftly moving red serial object.
