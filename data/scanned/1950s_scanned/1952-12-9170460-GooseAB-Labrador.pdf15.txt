To Whom It May Concern:

Possibly you may ignore this letter, disbelieve it, think it means nothing, has no value to interest you, deserves no particular consideration, or has no merit regarding your investigations. However, I would therewise, needless to say, or, I think, never have finally bothered to write to taken me fourteen years to decide to actually write this letter.

Being an actress by profession, for quite some time established in the public, with an accredited background, am more acutely aware than the average person of public reaction. Regarding the subject of this letter it would be claimed, among other things, that I'm seeking publicity; which is most untrue. Besides the public, I may be classified by your department as a "crack" or "kook-off"; I'm well aware that numerous people contacted you and quite generally are myd [?] that you and most instances, they no doubt define one category. Therefore, that is another one of the many reasons I've avoided writing you until now." 

Please note that the document appears to be somewhat faded, which might result in some inaccuracies in the transcription, especially where the text is not fully legible or where I've indicated uncertainty with a question mark.
