C.s. 
I believe this has been seen. This was reported to us as an unusual occurrence on the evening of Sept. 29, 1958. the object was observed by several residents of this area and reported to local authorities as an Unidentified Flying Object. The object was sighted approximately 10.30 p.m. and observed for about 15 minutes moving in a northerly direction at a low altitude. The object appeared to be round or oval in shape, emitting a bright light and seemed to hover at times. No sound was heard. The weather was clear at the time. Several residents were interviewed and provided similar descriptions of the object. This report is submitted for your information and appropriate action.

Sincerely,
