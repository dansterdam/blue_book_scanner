STATEMENT

Last night on the 22nd of May, 1955 we were some what upset to the howls from Rocky. He was on point of the hill overlooking Cheyenne. Not far from his stance the 15th Air Force radar station. This is one of our reasons for checking into Cheyenne for the past several nights and to investigate the activity going on in the Cheyenne area. Rocky said the sounds were very similar to CO30, but didn't know what it was. I took a look out the window. It appeared to be a miniature and then suddenly, only this thing gave off two or three very bright lights - they were there for about two or three minutes, and then they disappeared completely.

A few minutes later, there appeared in the sky moving objects, two or three in number, these were the lights that seemed to be going up and then dropping almost straight down, moving south, flying not too high.

She was in sight for about two minutes, then it appeared almost straight up and toward the south.
