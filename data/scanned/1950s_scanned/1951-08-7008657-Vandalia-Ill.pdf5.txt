"It wasn't a flying saucer, for it was a conventional type aircraft which watchers at Vandalia, Illinois at 9:30 last Monday night. About five persons who saw it passing through the air Monday night."

"It was a big orange light with blinking, intensely bright spots first noticed it over the CAA station north of Vandalia. As this writer was just leaving Vandalia at the time, I also noticed the light. It was between 9 and 9:30 p.m. and continued over the city for some little time, finally disappearing from view."

"The lighted object disappeared into the west. There was a steady, red light and observers are confident it continues with my flight plans."

"Shortly after I had taken off I noticed the light again, approaching my plane. It came directly at me and then circled my plane twice before heading downward. I followed it until it disappeared below the horizon."

"It was all very spooky," the Vandalia airman said. "It wasn't an aircraft of any kind to which I am accustomed. The red light on top, probably it was some military craft from Scott Field about 60 miles run."

"The lighted object which appeared to have a 10 to 12 inch lens, was also seen by bright forms in the sky the same evening."
