for example, or the technique of investigating the process of
mesmerism.  You can say will you investigate those things?  I
think probably we know no more about mind-reading than the
technique of investigating that or the technique of investi-
gating evidences of spiritualism than we do about those fields
but for many years ther field of spiritualism had these same
things in it in which completely competent creditable observers
reported incredible things.  I don't mean to say that this is
that sort of thing, but it's an explanation of an inability to
explain and that is with us.

THE PRESS: General, I understand that the wavelength
of the radar has something to do with what it can pick up in the
way of phenomena. Were these relatively low or relatively high
wavelength radar?

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: I couldn't say and I don't
know whether Captain James can or not, but I'd like to have him
have the opportunity.

CAPTAIN JAMES: These were relatively high frequency
or short wavelength.  However, the same effect can be observed
on long wavelength equipment with differing degrees.

THE PRESS: You say very short wavelength?

CAPTAIN JAMES: In this case, yes.

THE PRESS: They were designed for different purposes?

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: Yes, sir.

THE PRESS: General, why has the Air Force refused
to disclose the substance of Captain Mantell's air-ground
conversations before he died?  Do you remember that case?

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: Well, I don't know enough
about it to say what was said or what some reasons were.

THE PRESS: Well, a popular book made quite a point
of that, that the Air Force was holding back on that because
it told the true nature of the saucer, that he had approached
it, and --

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: Well, I wish that that were
true, that he did say something that hed enough substance In
it for use.  I haven't the slightest idea what he said.
