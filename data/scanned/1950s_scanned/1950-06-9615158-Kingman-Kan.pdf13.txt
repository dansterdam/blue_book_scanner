29 JUNE 1950
HECKER, S.D.

Your telegram requesting information with respect to certain reports of sightings of unidentified air phenomena is very much appreciated as evidence of your interest in this matter.

We wish that security and the great mass of such requests have compelled us to take a stern position in individual cases of the identification of aircraft and flying objects, and to withhold the names of persons who report them. But we are sure that you will understand that this is in your interest as well as it is in that of all Americans.

As to the matter of fact, the details of individual sightings reported during the 12/27/50 to 1/5/51 period are no longer available, since those data have been destroyed.

A comprehensive report of investigation of all sightings prior to 1952 was released to the public in October 1955 by the Secretary of the Air Force. This limited number of copies of this report prohibits its distribution to the public. A request for a copy contained in this report is referred to the information services, USAF, for appropriate action. A summary of the report is enclosed for your information.

Sincerely,

J. Isael
