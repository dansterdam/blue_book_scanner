Transcribing the text from the document:

I would judge the objects to be luminous meteors. I would judge that 2. About 2-3 minutes duration of observation 3. The objects appeared to be traveling from the northwest toward the southeast at an estimated altitude of 30,000 to 40,000 feet. 4. The objects appeared to be spherical in shape and bluish-white in color. 5. The objects appeared to be traveling at a speed estimated to be in excess of 1,000 miles per hour. 6. The objects disappeared from view when their altitude increased to a point where they were no longer visible to the observer.
EVALUATION: It is considered highly possible that the objects observed were luminous meteors. The description of their shape, color, speed and duration of observation is consistent with the characteristics of meteors.
