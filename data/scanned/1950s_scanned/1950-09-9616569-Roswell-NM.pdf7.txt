Statement of **************************

On 25 October 1950, at 1242, as I was traveling SE on Highway 421, 3 miles west of Boalsburg, N.C., I sighted an unidentified object in the sky. The object appeared to be a disc-like shape with a dull reddish glow to a dull graying mixture. The object kept the same shape but appeared to be shifting in position, and appeared to be equivalent to two B-36 fuselages stacked one above the other.

The object appeared to be about two miles distant, and as I watched it, I observed it slowly move across the highway from SE to NW over a 30 second period and disappeared into the overcast SSW. Overcast was 600-700 feet.

The next time I saw it, it appeared to be about a distance of 40 seconds, when I first saw it. I thought possibly it was a water tank in Boalsburg, until it started moving.

The observation was visual from the surface. 

I am a former Air Force pilot, and my home address is ************** Street, Greensboro, N.C.
