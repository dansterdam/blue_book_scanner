SUPPLEMENT TO AF FORM 112
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
"Considering the excellent weather conditions and the circumstances surrounding the sighting, the possible explanations that could be applied, such as balloons, rockets, or aircraft, are in my opinion inadequate to explain the maneuvers of the objects observed, which were completely out of the ordinary or normal for any known craft. The observers could detect no sound or trail, and the objects seemed to travel at extremely high speeds."
It is stated that they could not have been any known or common aircraft vehicles, and the objects sighted were of a definitely unusual and unfamiliar character, and the observers were all familiar with aircraft. It was also stated that the flight paths would be considered "impossible" for any known types of aircraft. The objects were able to make extremely sharp turns, stops, and accelerations, which would not be possible with any such experimental models because their movements indicated that they could violate any known laws of physics.
SOURCES ruled out the possibilities that the objects belonged to any nation, including the United States, due to the fact that there was nothing important to gain from an investigation as to their origin.
SOURCES did not believe that they were experimental models or secret devices of any kind, nor that they were reflections or other meteorological phenomena. It was assumed that the only explanation other than the above was that the objects were of some type not known to our civilization (perhaps there are explanations which are not apparent).
SOURCES stated that the investigator (or somebody or something) had to be overcome by the investigator's tendency to restrict SOURCES' conclusions within the framework of his limited knowledge and conditioned reasoning.
