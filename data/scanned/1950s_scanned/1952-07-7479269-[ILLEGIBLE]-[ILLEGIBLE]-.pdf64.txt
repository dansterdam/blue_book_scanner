The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten document describing a UFO sighting.

The text of the document is as follows:

In your own words please describe the sighting you observed. Use sketches if desired. All observations from the time of first sighting to the time of disappearance are important. Include a description of the weather, wind, and cloud conditions at the time of this sighting.

Our air was very still and not a cloud in sight. We observed an object that just appeared to take the night as it was overhead and viewed at close range. The object appeared and disappeared at various times. Their movement was so swift at light.
