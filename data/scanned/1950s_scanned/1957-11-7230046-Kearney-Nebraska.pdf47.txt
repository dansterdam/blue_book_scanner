34                            THE KEARNEY INCIDENT

scientists, I decided to go to the
minister of my faith and tell him
about it and ask him what to do.
He wasn’t in. Then I drove over to
the police station and asked them
if they had seen the sheriff. The
sheriff was out of the office all at-
ternoon, they said, but the deputy sher-
iff was at the courthouse. They call-
ed him and made an appointment
for me to meet him there. I went
to the courthouse and told the de-
puty what had happened that after-
noon.
The deputy was the first person to
hear of my experience. He said,
“Let’s get out there.” We got into
his car, and started out. On the way
he said, “This is quite a coincidence.
Did you hear the siren blow at noon
today?”
“Yes,” I said, “I was in my room
at the hotel at the time and I
thought it was a fire.”
“No,” he said, “someone called and
reported a strange object or ship in
the sky moving toward Kearney.”
When we got to the scene of the
ship’s landing we could see the im-
print of the four hydraulic rams on
the dry bed of the Platt River. Also,
toward one end of the spot where
the ship stood we found some oil on
the sand and leaves. It was dark
green in color, fine in texture and
sweet smelling, but where it really
came from, I do not know.
I suggested to the deputy that we
rope off this area and get some
guards out there. But he wanted to
go back to town and get some of the
other officials and see what they
said. We went back to Kearney and
reported to the chief of police about
my experience and what we had
seen. Then the chief wanted to go
out there and he asked the city at-
torney to go along. We also picked
up a reporter from the local news-
paper. There were five of us then,
on this second trip - and we drove
out in the police car with the siren
going all the way.
Everybody saw the imprints and
the oil in the sand and they all a-
greed that there had been a large
object of some kind setting there.
The deputy and I stepped off the
distance between the imprints in
the sand and we estimated the ship
to be 100 feet long and 30 feet wide;
and I estimated it was about 14 feet
high.
I again asked if they didn’t think
it a good idea to rope off this area
and call someone in authority and
report the ship. They said it wouldn’t
be necessary as there were five wit-
nesses here and they were convinced
that a large ship had landed here.
We gathered some of the greenish
oil in a small mustard glass we
found on the river bank. The chief
of police said he would have it test-
ed. We drove back to town and they
left me off at the Fort Kearney Ho-
tel where I was staying.
I felt I had done my citizen’s duty
in reporting the ship and now I was
through. I sat down in the lobby
and was watching TV when the local
program was cut off for a special
news flash—
“SPACESHIPS LAND AT KEARNEY,
          NEBRASKA”
This was put on the air without
my knowledge or permission. In fact,
I had not even called the object a
spaceship as I did not know what it
was.
About thirty minutes later the
phone began to ring and everybody—
reporters, photographers, citizens,
etc.—wanted more information. The
chief of police then called me and
asked me if I would come over and
help answer the telephones as he
too was swamped with calls. I went
over to the police station and the
chief turned his office over to me
with two phones. I answered those
two phones and the chief took calls
