24. In order that we can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you would construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? If it were large would it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which, when placed up in the sky, would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

Except for the size, this appeared somewhat like a standard fuel tank from a jet aircraft, except that it had no visible markings, rivets, or external fittings of any kind. Its surface seemed smooth and metallic, somewhat similar to stainless steel. The fact that it passed at high speed with no apparent means of propulsion or control, and that it was so large, was what gave it an unusual appearance.
