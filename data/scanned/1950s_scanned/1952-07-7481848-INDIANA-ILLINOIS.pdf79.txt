UFO SIGHTINGS ON 6 DEC 63
WAS SHAPE OF SAUCER (Mrs. Celeste)
WASH D.C. 6330

1. In reply to request of the reports from Mr. [REDACTED] in a letter dated 17 August 1964:

2. The observation of 6 July 1952 did not contain the duration of the sighting. The object was circular, white in color, and disappeared into the distance. The estimated size was 20-25 feet diameter. The object was observed for approximately 30-60 seconds. It did not indicate that sound accompanied the sighting. The object was observed from the window of a restaurant and there was nothing around the object to indicate its size. Due to the close proximity of the object to the observer, and the slow speed for 10-15 mph, the observer is certain of the observation.

3. It is suggested that an ELT form 164 be forwarded to Mr. [REDACTED]. We are unable to explain this observation on the data presented.

4. Regarding the sighting of 29 August 1963 we are again at a loss to explain this observation. The object appeared below and behind a house and a telephone pole. The motion cannot be compared with any known aircraft. The description contained the basic data required for evaluation. Since the sighting is several years old it is not feasible to conduct an investigation. Any information that should be given a more or less routine response.
