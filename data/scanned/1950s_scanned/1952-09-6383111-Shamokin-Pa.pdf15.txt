LUMINOUS OBJECT SEEN OVER MALLORCA -- Tangier, Espana, 4 Sep 52  
REFER TO CASE: 16 Jul 52, 'Operation Crossroad Case'  

On 3 September 1952, late at night, four professors of the Seraphic Seminary in Palma, Mallorca Island, noticed a luminous disk in the sky, traveling from west to east. They said that it could not have been a shooting star and that they were giving the report as objectively as possible in its barest details to provide another item for the study of the flying saucer phenomenon.
