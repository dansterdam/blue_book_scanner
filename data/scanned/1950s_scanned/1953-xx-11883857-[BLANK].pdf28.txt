STARS OR PLANETS

GENERAL

The planets, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are generally brighter 
than any star, but they twinkle very much less (unless very close to 
horizon). Stars twinkle a great deal and when near the horizon can give

1. Shape: Pinpoint - starlike.
2. Size: Never appreciable.
3. Color: Yellow with rainbow variations.
4. Speed: Stars apparent speeds carry them from east to west in the 
   course of the night but they are often reported as erratic.

   consider a point as being stationary. Occasionally tur-
   bulence in the upper atmosphere can cause a star to appear 
   to jump (rare) but somehow twinkling gives the impression of 
   movement to many people.
5. Formation: There are no clusters of very bright stars but faint 
   stars are grouped in their familiar constellations.
   Note: A report of 4 or 5 bright clustering lights would 
   rule out stars.
6. Trail: None.
7. Sound: None.
8. Course: Always describe 24 hoar circle around pole or sky from east
