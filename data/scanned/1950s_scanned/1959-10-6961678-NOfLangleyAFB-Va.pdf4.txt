There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned document page from Project Blue Book, a US Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The document text is as follows:

device launched by a soviet submarine. This could account
for the low altitude, since an enemy would attempt to avoid
detection by our radar. The sighting was followed by a radioactive deposit in the area. However, it has been reported
as an increase in the radioactivity of the area it might now be
due to natural causes.

From the material collected by Bryant and investigators,
the Air Force has no definite conclusions. The object was
reminiscent of the famous Fitzgerald case, in which the
civilian investigators claimed that the object was some kind
of naval or military device, but which was never identified.
It is well known in the area and do not have a questionable
reputation regarding their observations, so we are requested
to accept their report as an accurate description of what they
observed. If you, the readers of this report, are dissatisfied
with my analysis of this case, I will appreciate over-all consideration or any other observed objects or incidents which
you have witnessed and consider important. We recommend
they contact this office for further assistance.

We believe this country's citizenry is entitled to know
all the facts of the UFO problem. Since incidents or sightings are infrequent in this area, and where we lack positive
evidence, we want everyone who can contribute to this knowledge
to do so. All letters received will be read and evaluated. We
request that all such data be forwarded to this office.
