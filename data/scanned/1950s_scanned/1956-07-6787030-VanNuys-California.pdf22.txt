The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document says:

OFFICIAL BUSINESS
LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL
Photos of an object sighted on 17 june.

The document also has some header information at the top that says:
Headquarters
4602d Air Intelligence Service Squadron (ADC)
United States Air Force
Ent Air Force Base, Colorado

And there is a warning at the bottom that says:
PENALTY FOR PRIVATE USE TO AVOID
PAYMENT OF POSTAGE, $300
