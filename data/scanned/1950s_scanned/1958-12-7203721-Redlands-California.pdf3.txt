The image contains a grainy, black-and-white photograph that appears to show a UFO or unidentified aerial object. The object is difficult to make out clearly, but it appears to be a dark, elongated shape against a blurry background. There is text in the top left corner of the image that reads "13 DEC 1956 REDLANDS, CALIFORNIA".
