DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: (The following is a verbatim account)
"On 25 June 1954, at approximately 10:45 pm (EDST), my wife and I were driving on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway near Hillcrest Heights, Maryland, when we sighted an object in the sky which Mrs. Zawalt didn't or couldn't identify. We all went outside to observe it. It was moving from East to West at a fairly high speed. It appeared to be on fire, and gave off a glow which lit up the surrounding area. There were no airplanes flying at this time. The object was over-shadowing and obscuring the stars. After it had passed from East to West, it made a sharp 90 degree turn to the South and disappeared from view. No sound was heard. The object had no wings or tail, and can only be guessed at. It was found or at least resembled a glowing 11-inch disc, which was motionless for approximately 15 to 20 seconds, after which the object disappeared."
