1. This report pertains to the sighting of an unidentified flying
object, similar in structure to the so-called "Flying Discs," by Captain
G. B. EDWARDS, pilot, Captain THURON C. FEHEYACH, co-pilot, and 1st Lt.
JOHN H. VAN SANTEN, passenger, of C-45 type aircraft en route from Pope

2. Captain G. B. EDWARDS and Captain THURON C. FEHEYACH were
interviewed on 30 January 1950 in their office, Room 1C 1066, National
Defense Building, Washington, D. C., and gave in substance the following
information concerning the incident:

a. On Tuesday, 24 January 1950, while en route from Pope Air
Force Base, North Carolina, to Bolling Air Force Base, Washington, D.C.,
in C-45 type aircraft No. 7122, Captain THURON C. FEHEYACH was first to
notice the unidentified flying object. FEHEYACH stated that the C-45
was pursuing a course of approximately 260 at 5,000 ft. when his C-45
noticed the object slightly to the left of the course and about 2,000 ft.
higher at a distance of 5 to 10 miles from the C-45. The object was
approximately 7,000 ft. just above the top of the cloud level which was
at.that time approximately 5/10 cloud coverage. It was darker than
the clouds and easy to distinguish as not being a cloud. Then first
noticed the object was pursuing a course between and above two rather
large cloud banks, which were estimated as being two miles apart. The
object moved from the left cloud to the right cloud twice and never at
any time did the object show any radius of turn. It moved to a stop
and proceeded back again with a fine horizontal movement, at no time
varying vertical in an assent or descent motion. At this time Captain
FEHEYACH showed the unconventional aircraft to Captain EDWARDS who
immediately altered his course some 5 degrees and climbed to 7,000 ft.
to be horizontally on the same level as the object. The C-45 pursued
the object at approximately 160 miles per hour with a 20 mile tail wind.
The C-45 at no time could overtake the object and at all times it seemed
to stay between 5 to 10 miles directly in front and at the same level as
the C-45. At this time FEHEYACH had the passenger, Lt. Van SANTEN, view
the object. The object then seemed to disappear in front of their view,
increasing its speed. The entire action thus far reported took approxi-
latest minutesSaiUNCLASSIFIED
