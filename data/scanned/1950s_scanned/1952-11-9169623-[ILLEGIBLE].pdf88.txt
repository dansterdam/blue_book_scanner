AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: (AGENCY)
DET 1, 6604th AISS, APO 970

DATE 2-3-50

SUBJECT: S2-350

The balloon released was a natural latex (white) color. The rate of ascent on this initial flight was approximately 600 fpm. The burst was observed at approximately 60,000 ft. The balloon carried a small radio transmitter, which emitted an intermittent signal until the balloon burst. The balloon descended slowly, and it was estimated that one part of the balloon was still attached to the payload or instrument after the burst. It will be possible that the unidentified object could have been this 350 balloon.

D/F SNAP Comments:
Not being able to identify the object conclusively would naturally lead to the assumption that the unidentified sighting was the 350 balloon. However, the description of the sighting does not agree with the characteristics of the 350 balloon, which was a normal latex type and ascended and burst at the usual altitudes. There have been a number of reports of unidentified sightings in this area at about the time of this incident, so the object observed was probably something other than the 350 balloon. It is reported that at least 5 sightings have tentatively been identified, and if these reports are correct, the object seen was not the 350 balloon.

It is therefore apparent that the object observed was not the 350 balloon, and was probably a balloon, and possibly a natural or artificial satellite. The object was probably a balloon, and possibly a natural or artificial satellite.
