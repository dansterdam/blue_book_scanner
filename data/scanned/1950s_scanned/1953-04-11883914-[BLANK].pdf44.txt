This tour will be completed July 1. After Dr. Hynek had spent a short time on this tour, word was received from him that he is obtaining some interesting information from professional astronomers about sightings they have made which they have never otherwise reported. On a preliminary basis, it appears that the results of this survey will be valuable to the investigation.

Interrogation Forms:
Dr. Paul M. Fitts, Professor of Psychology and Director of Aviation Psychology at Ohio State University, and a group of his associates are now engaged in revising the Tentative Observer's Interrogation Form. 
Exhibit I, of the June 6 report. The object of this revision is to design the questionnaire so that a maximum of information regarding a sighting can be expected from the average individuals who will be filling out the questionnaires on future sightings. Trial tests with the revised questionnaire are planned to determine if the desired information on a sighting is obtained with it. It is expected that this revised questionnaire will be completed about July 16.
