GARY POST TRIBUNE SUNDAY JULY 15TH 1956

Saucer or Jewel? Sky Visitor A Mystery
Bright Light Seen
On Gary Horizon
Stays for Hour,
Moves to South

Gary had a mysterious visitor in the sky early yesterday. It was not a plane, satellite or anything man-made, but a bright light that remained hoverin on the horizon for over an hour before moving to the southwest and disappearing.

The light was first noticed about 11:15 p.m. Saturday by three persons who were returning from the Gary Theater in the 2600 block of Broadway. They said the light appeared to be low in the southwestern sky, pulsating and changing colors from white to red and green.

The persons who saw the light were Walter Dombrowski, 2520 Washington St., and two companions. Dombrowski said the light seemed to be "as big as a house" and occasionally flashed brilliantly.

"It was like a full moon, only much brighter. The light would dim down until it was almost impossible to see, then it would flash up again, brighter than ever," Dombrowski said.

He said the light was stationary for over an hour, then began drifting slowly to the south southwest until it disappeared from sight.

The light was also seen by several other persons in the Gary area, including patrolman Albert DeMarco, who was on duty at the time. DeMarco said he watched the light for more than 45 minutes.

The Air Force said this morning that there had been no reports of any aircraft, balloons, satellites or other known objects in the area that could explain the light. The sighting is being investigated, but the Air Force has no explanation for the mysterious light at this time.
