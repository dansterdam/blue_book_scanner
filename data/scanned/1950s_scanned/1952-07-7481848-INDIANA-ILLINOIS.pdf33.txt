1. The following information was received by this office from Headquarters Camp Atterbury, Indiana:
On 16 July 1952, the 911th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, an Air Force Reserve unit, reported that at approximately 2315 CDT on 15 July 1952, the radar operators on duty observed an unidentified target on their radar screen. This target was picked up at a distance of approximately 10 miles from the radar site, and was tracked for approximately 45 minutes, during which time it was observed to change speeds, accelerations, and general maneuvering characteristics in a manner suggesting an unconventional aircraft. The object finally disappeared from the radar screen at a distance of approximately 70 miles from the radar site, and was observed to have been traveling at an estimated speed of 1,000 to 1,500 mph. Military and civilian personnel on duty at the radar site were unanimous in their statements that the performance characteristics of the object were beyond the capabilities of any known type of aircraft.
