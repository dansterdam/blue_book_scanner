DEAR SIRS:

We, the directors of U.F.O. Research Associates, would like any information that you could give us in the "Chancy Case" - the case which was reported to have taken place in case No. 1-53, which involves the reported destruction of a Pipers Cub airplane to one Fred Mergan. The incident which was to have taken place on a day in July, 1953, when Serge's plane was said to have collided with an object of some sort, at Cherry Point, N.C. - Feb. 11, 1953.

The Marine Corps reported that no damage had been caused and was unable to find any trace of the object which had passed through the sky at better than 500 miles per hour. Any information that you could give us would help in our study of the UFO PHENOMENA.

Sincerely,
Richard L. Dickinson
Paul W. Seith
