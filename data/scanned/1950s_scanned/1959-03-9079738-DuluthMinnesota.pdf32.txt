CONCLUSIONS
An F-94 on night training flight near Duluth, Minnesota observed a bright light which appeared to be gaining altitude and moving away from the aircraft. The pilot accelerated but was unable to close on the object. He lost sight of the object as it disappeared. The unknown light was descried by the pilot as glowing with a constant intensity and as he ended the sighting, he decided that he could not make close on the unknown light.
