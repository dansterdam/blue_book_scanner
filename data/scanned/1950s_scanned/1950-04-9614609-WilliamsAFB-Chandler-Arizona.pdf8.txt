UFO SIGHTING (Capt. Gruickshanks) 

TO: SAFIS-3, Attn: Maj. L. J. Tacker

FROM: AFOIN-4E

COMMENTS (For reverse, if necessary):

1. Search of the Air Technical Intelligence Center* reveals that on all Saturdays in April 1950, failed to reveal that Captain Gruickshanks made a report of a sighting which occurred during this period. 

2. Analysis of the information submitted by Captain Gruickshanks leads to the conclusion that the object of his sighting was a meteor (a fireball).

3. Daylight sightings of meteors are relatively rare; however, the magnitude of Captain Gruickshanks' sighting (seen from 35 or more miles away) are visible in daylight so plausible. 

4. The object of Captain Gruickshanks' sighting traversed approximately 90 degrees in the sky in 10 seconds, indicating a very high velocity. This is obviously great distance from the observer, results in a much higher velocity than would normally be attributed to the 25 miles per minute velocity of a typical meteor, or 1700 miles per hour. However, according to the object, the linear velocity of this meteor is approximately 18,000 to 20,000 miles per hour which is consistent with a meteor.
