DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

10 May 1960

MEMORANDUM FOR MAJOR WRIGHT, SAFLL

SUBJECT: Reply to Congressman Hardy's UFO Inquiry

The following is recommended as basis for reply to Congressman Hardy:

"We have noted the contents of Mr. 's letter of 19 April, and are left with the impression that he believes the Air Force is censoring UFO information and denying to the American public data which should be available to them.

On the contrary, the Air Force policy is to provide the public with maximum information on this subject. When on occasion it is necessary to withhold data, this is done only to protect the people involved from the idle curiosity of the sensation seekers, to keep from compromising our investigative processes or to prevent exposure of gaps or deficiencies in our defense system.

The Air Force does not deny that unknown objects have been seen by responsible people. It is in the interpretation of these sightings that we are questioned. From our investigations covering the past twelve-year period, the Air Force contends that when the evidence of these sightings has been sifted through the scientific criteria it has led to the conclusion that the objects were not space craft and they did not constitute a threat to the security of this country."
