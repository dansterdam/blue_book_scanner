AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
23-200-80

All three men have a limited education with no military experience. The operation of the object with large target balloons was due to the fact that they had observed similar objects before and considered themselves qualified to handle the situation, thinking that there might be aerial gunnery conducted in the area.

The object was observed separately from high ground elsewhere, with no significance attached to the sightings other than the observers being qualified and recognizing the objects as something unusual - objects of unidentified nature were reported in this area.

A possibility exists that a weather balloon may have descended in this area, however, it is not possible to determine whether a weather balloon or something else caused the locally released balloons.

Local weather sequence was as follows: 1) 16302, 30 August 1950, ceiling 4,000 feet, visibility 15 miles, temperature 56°F, wind northwest at 15 knots. 2) 16352, 30 August 1950, ceiling broken at 5,000 feet, visibility 15 miles, wind northwest at 5 knots, temperature 55°F, dew point 48°F, wind north-northwest at 7 knots.

Control tower and GCA personnel were questioned with negative results.

Three aircraft (a B-29, a TCA DC-3, and a KLM DC-3) were observed field and tracked across the Coast prior to observation of the unidentified objects.
