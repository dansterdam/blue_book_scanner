The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed document describing an observation of a "flying disk" by astronomers from the University of Brazil. The document includes details about the size, movement, and appearance of the object, as well as the reactions and observations of the astronomers who witnessed it.

OBSERVATION OF RIO SAW FLYING DISK

For the first time in the world the strange phenomenon is seen by an observatory. Astronomers guarantee that at no mistake would be impossible. 

It was twice as large as the planet Venus and could be seen by the naked eye.

Rio, 14 (AP) Three astronomers of the observatory of the University of Brazil watched through a telescope an object flying at an elevation of from 10:10 to 10:30 p.m. The trajectory of a flying disk at the elevation of the 8llls contaming the motion moving toward the austral triangle and the Southern Cross until it disappeared in the haze of the horizon. The public statement was made by Professor Luis Gaheia of the National Faculty of Philosophy, and he has added that the astronomers and Captain (redacted) of the Nautical School of the Army supported him.

CORRECTION

"I have no doubt whatever but that it was a flying disk," said Professor (redacted). "We are used to making these observations and we would not confound the apparatus with any celestial body, balloon, sonde, or interplanetary rocket."

Very excited, the Professor said that the disk traversed 110 degrees in 23 minutes, but he was not able to calculate the linear velocity because at that hour their measuring instruments had been put away.

After confirming Luis's declarations, Captain Sire added that the flying disk could be seen by the naked eye and that its size was that of the planet Venus and not twinkling like that of the stars.
