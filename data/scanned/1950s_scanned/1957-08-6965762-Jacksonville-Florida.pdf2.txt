The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with several lines of text that have been redacted or obscured.

As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

A. 6965762
b. Jacksonville, Florida
c. Date of Investigation: 17 August 1957

The remainder of the text has been redacted or obscured and cannot be reliably transcribed.
