SPRING - 1952 - HASSELBACH. SAXONIA

I WAS RIDING HOME ON..... MOTOR IN...HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FRONT OF HOUSE LOOKING AT THE SKY, JUST AS I WAS RIDING HOME ON MY BICYCLE, WHEN I REACHED THE EDGE OF THE VILLAGE OF HASSELBACH: SOMETHING ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YARDS AWAY, AT FIRST SIGHT, IT APPEARED TO BE A PILE OF METALLIC SEEMING OBJECTS. AS I APPROACHED THIS, IT WAS NOW ABOUT SIXTY YARDS FROM IT. IMPRESSION HAD BEEN INCORPORATED - THE THING 9 APPEARED TO BE RESTING ON THE GROUND. THE CASING CAME UP IN A SORT OF A DOME SHAPE AND SEEMED TO BE MADE OF A SHINY, METALLIC SUBSTANCE, AND WAS WARM TO THE TOUCH. I SAW THAT IT WAS NOW ABOUT THIRTY YARDS FROM ME. THERE WAS A RING OF A BLACK CYLINDRICAL SEEMING TOWER ABOUT TEN CENTIMETERS IN HEIGHT AROUND THE EDGE. TWO ROWS OF HOLES ALONG THE SIDES, ABOUT A FOOT IN DIAMETER. SUDDENLY ABOUT TEN CM OF THE METALLIC OBJECT ROSE UP OUT OF THE HOLES IN THE CYLINDRICAL TOWER, COMING TOWARDS ME. I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS VIBRATING. IT THEN SANK BACK DOWN INTO THE TOWER. SUDDENLY IT ROSE UP AGAIN HIGHER AND I SAW THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP FLASHED ON AND OFF AT REGULAR INTERVALS. IT REMAINED VIBRATING AND REMAINED STEADILY IN THAT POSITION, AT WHICH TIME I HEARD A WHISTLING SOUND, RATHER LIKE THE NOISE MADE BY A GROWING AWAY OF STEAM. NOW THE COLOR CHANGED TO RED, THEN CHANGED TO GREEN, THEN CHANGED TO WHITE. AT TIMES IT SEEMED TO BE GLOWING. IT THEN ROSE SLOWLY FROM THE GROUND. I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT THE GLOWING EXHAUST WAS PROPELLING IT UPWARDS FROM THE GROUND. IT SEEMED TO BE RESTING ON THE CYLINDRICAL PIECE WHICH HAD SUNK THROUGH THE CENTER. SUDDENLY THE WHOLE THING THAT WAS GLOWING OUTSIDE ROSE UP OFF THE WARMING PAN WITH ITS GLOWING OUTSIDE RING OF FLAME. WAS NOW SOME FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. I COULD SEE THAT THE WHOLE OF THE INSIDE OF THE CYLINDER ON WHICH IT HAD RESTED HAD NOW DISAPPEARED INSIDE THE CENTER AND SEEMED TO BE GLOWING INSIDE ITSELF. SUDDENLY IT SHOT UP AT TERRIFIC SPEED AND DISAPPEARED OVER HILLS IN THE DISTANCE, DAUGHTER AND I HEARD A WHISTLING SOUND, RATHER LIKE THE NOISE MADE BY A GROWING AWAY OF STEAM OR AIR. IT WAS STILL GAINING HEIGHT OVER THE HILLS AND DISAPPEARED. SOMETHING WHICH THEY TOOK FOR A COMET? ONE, SHOULDERS BROAD. HE LOOKED TO ABOUT THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY YEARS OF AGE. HE WAS BOUNDING OFF UNWARRANTEDLY INTO THE WOODS.

SAWMILL WATCHMAN TOLD THEM HE HAD SEEN WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A "SLOW FLYING OBJECT" ABOUT TWO HOURS BEFORE, WHICH HAD MOVED WITH ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND OR AIR DISTURBANCE, AND THAT HIS DAUGHTER AND HE HAD DREAMED THE WHOLE EPISODE. IT WAS NOT FOR ONE MINUTE THAT I BELIEVED THAT MY DAUGHTER AND I HAD BEEN DREAMING. I REALIZED THEN THAT THE THING HAD GONE. I WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE IT HAD BEEN STANDING. I FOUND A CIRCULAR DEPRESSION, EVIDENTLY FRESHLY MADE, WHERE THE EARTH HAD BEEN STANDING. I REALIZED THEN THAT I HAD NOT BEEN DREAMING.
