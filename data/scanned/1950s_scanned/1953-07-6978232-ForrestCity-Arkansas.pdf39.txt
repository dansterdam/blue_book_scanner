18 - Very probably a meteor. Sending questionnaires. Ask your confirmation.
13 - Sending two questionnaires. Ask detailed information on this sighting and ground observation conditions to gain this sounds like a meteor.
11 - Possibility here of upper air research balloons although our people on Many Dick balloons show none in vicinity for this date.

WAR activity starting from Carolina area, however. Sending questionnaires to various Observers involved. This is to WADC (COLS) for local balloon release. Carrying this as unresolved.

Dear Dr. Rynski:

It has been sometime since we have received any comments on the sightings and are anxious to get your opinion on same. When do you expect to have the pertinent information which you indicated would be forthcoming and when can we expect it? I would appreciate it if you would advise me on this, and also on the status of the Washington Conference this week on Press Release and now if a regulation for this Project and so tie up my project as I suppose to be personal.

Capt. Russell is due back today and we anxious to see him, and as I think I have told you, he will be participating with my replacement project until my replacement arrives.

Best regards,

Bob Olsson
