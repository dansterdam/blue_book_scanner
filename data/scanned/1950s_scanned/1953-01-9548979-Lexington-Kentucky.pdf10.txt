The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an object above the horizon (skyline), and the instructions ask the viewer to imagine that they are at the point shown and place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when they first saw it. The second sketch shows a road or path with buildings and trees on either side, as well as a smaller sketch showing a curved horizon line.

Text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
