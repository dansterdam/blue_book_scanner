SUBJECT: Analysis of UFO Report, IR-01-56
TO: Commander
4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron (.AIS)
Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan

1. Reference 4602d AISS UFOB Report Nr. 469, originally submitted under AF Form 112. IR-01-56, from Headquarters, 27th Air Division, 5 August 1956.

2. Attached hereto is a negative and photograph of an unidentified flying object photographed over San Bernardino, California on 19 July 1956. Also appended are three enlargements print enlargements of varying densities used in the analysis of the object photographed.

3. Comments on this Camera Center: On the basis of a review of the information submitted and a photo analysis of the photo material submitted, the following comments are offered:

a. With a negative size of 2 9/16 by 1 11/16 inches, the focal length of the lens are assumed to be approximately 3 inches (75 mm).

b. The image size of the object on the negative is 5/16 inch, over-all size.

c. The distance of the object as given by the source in the report is estimated to be approximately 3,000 yards. This size would appear to be in the order of two-thirds the size of a football field, or over 200 feet in diameter.

d. An object of such size appearing over a populated city or area of California could certainly have been noticed and reported by a large number of persons. No reports on this type of incident are indicated for this particular day or area.

e. A study of the photograph shows that the foliage in the foreground, the leaves on the trees in the background, and the two telephone poles are in focus, while the object is not. This would indicate the collage is in the background, and the object is a long distance in the foreground.
