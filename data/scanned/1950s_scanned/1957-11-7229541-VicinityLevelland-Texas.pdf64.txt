Inclosure 2 to Part Two:

To whom it may concern: On the date of November 2, 1957, I was travelling north and west on route 116, driving my truck. At about 4:35 a.m. I was 10 miles south of Levelland, Texas, and I saw a bright light come down from the sky. It seemed to hover over the highway and then shot up into the sky and disappeared. I stopped my truck, got out, and took a look, but it was so rapid and quick that I could not make out what it was.
