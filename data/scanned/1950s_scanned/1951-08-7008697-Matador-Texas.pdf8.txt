AT LAWTON, OKLAHOMA
On 16 October 1951, Mrs. ___ of Lawton, Oklahoma, was interviewed and stated in substance that on 31 August 1951 at approximately 1845 hours, while driving on the highway from White Flat to Matador, Texas, she observed an object which appeared to be about the same size as a Piper Cub airplane approximately 1-2 miles from her at an altitude of 200-300 feet. The object was between 125-150 yards from her automobile and looked to be about the same size as a bushel basket. It appeared to be glowing and made no sound. The object remained stationary for a brief period, then appeared to be bouncing or bobbing up and down, and finally disappeared in a "flash" over a mesquite thicket in the landing area.

Mrs. ___ stated that when she first sighted the object it appeared to be floating as a glowing object. As she drew closer the object appeared to be hovering in a stationary position and then it suddenly disappeared from sight. There was no noise nor sign of exhaust or smoke. The object appeared to be floating at approximately the same height as the derrick on the Job's oil well. (Described in referenced report as 120' overall height.)

In describing the object, Mrs. ___ stated that the only object which resembled the shape of the object was that of a pear. She further stated that the object appeared to be a door or window located on the tapered end of the object; that the object was flying with the tapered end forward. The luminous part of the object made an accurate glow and made no sound.

AGENT'S NOTE: Mrs. ___ appeared sincere and honest in her description of this incident and impressed this agent as an intelligent and serious individual.
