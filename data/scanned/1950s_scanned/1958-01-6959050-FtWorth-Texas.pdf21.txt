SUPPLEMENTAL MEMORANDUM
February 4, 1959
Fort Worth, Texas

Due to the interruption of weather conditions which limited visibility and the presence of other matters, I was unable to identify the star referred to on Page 3 of my original memorandum dated January 29, 1959 until Monday, February 3. Thanks to the assistance of Mr. [REDACTED], who could not make a visual observation with me due to weather conditions but who noted the star from my description, I have now identified the star as being [REDACTED], which I believe to be about second degree of magnitude. This star is not in the Orion constellation and does not constitute the belt of "The Hunter" in the constellation Orion. If I project a line from the bottom of these three stars in Orion, as I look eastward into the northern horizon, it would intersect the constellation [REDACTED], which I understand is Alpha Geminorum, this line will intersect the gemini star which I fixed at 4 points roughly midway, somewhat closer to Castor than the middle in Orion but closer to point previously than "Castor".
