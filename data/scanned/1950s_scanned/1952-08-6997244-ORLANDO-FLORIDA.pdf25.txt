SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS SPOTTED IN SINGAPORE SKY

At 7:40 P.M., they first saw a very bright round "globe" traveling from the direction of the sea towards the land. About two hours later, another similar object was seen again.

The Chinese resident said today that the "objects" travelled at a terrific speed without trail, smoke or sound. When he tried to look at it carefully, it disappeared.

Suddenly it disappeared before I could look at it carefully, he said.

Last Thursday evening, excitement was also caused in a near town when villagers there noticed a bright "strange" speeding across the sky.

The object was said to have radiated a bright greenish light and disappeared behind the hills near Bukit Timah.
