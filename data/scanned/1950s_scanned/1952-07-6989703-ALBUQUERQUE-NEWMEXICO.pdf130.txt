All I can say is that the objects I saw were unusual. They seemed to be lights of some kind. I didn't think they were aircraft at the time, and I still don't think they were aircraft. Some had balls of light, some of them had definite shapes. I can't tell you more than I've already said. I know you have to be skeptical, but I saw these things and they were not like anything I've seen before. The whole thing is a mystery to me as much as it is to you.
