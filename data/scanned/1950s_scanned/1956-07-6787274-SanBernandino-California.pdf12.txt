The image does not contain any photographs. This appears to be a page from an official Project Blue Book UFO report document.

We are returning a negative and four prints of an unidentified aerial object which was observed over San Bernardino, California on July 7, 1956. Your photograph and a report of the circumstances surrounding the observation were referred to this Center for analysis by Air Force personnel who investigated the matter.

The image size of the object on the negative is 2 3/16 by 1 11/16 inches, the total length of the lens is assumed to be approximately 3 inches. The image is slightly blurred, possibly due to camera motion. The image size of the object on the prints is 5 1/16 inch, over-all size.

The image in the report is estimated at 300 yards at a distance of approximately 1400 feet. The object of such size appearing over this particular area and location would equate approximately to the size of a football field, or over 400 feet in diameter.

Analysis of the photograph shows that the foliage in the background, and the two distant hills, between which the object is located, are in good focus, indicating the object is at a considerable distance. The object, however, appears somewhat fuzzy and indistinct.

The analysis indicates that the cut-off-edge distortions noticeable by apparent unsharp spots, but these are very close to the normal exposure, and is essentially imperceptible clues to suggest the object is a very close proximity to the camera.
