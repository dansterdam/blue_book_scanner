There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from a document containing handwritten text.

I would really have no way of knowing - certainly no more than you - as to the exact nature of this phenomena. I take your word it was sighted here one evening and described as a light. From this report, it appears to have been moving rapidly in an irregular path not customary of any conventional aerial device. The lack of noise and ability to maintain a directed course are also quite unusual in relation to conventional aircraft.

While I cannot say definitively what this sighting may have been, I would suggest it falls into the category of unexplained phenomena which, as you know, we have a number of reports on in our files. We have no conclusive evidence of the nature or origin of these types of sightings. They remain unexplained and unidentified. I hope this further report may be of some interest and value to you in accumulating data on these matters. Please let me know if I can be of any additional assistance.

Sincerely yours,
