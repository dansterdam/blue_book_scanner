5 March 1958

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 15 February concerning an unidentified flying object in Naples, Italy.

The U.S. Air Force has received no report on this sighting or incident.

The United Press carried a news item on or about 12 February 1958 stating a military type rocket inadvertently placed in an incinerator had caused a mysterious explosion in Naples, and it caused much excitement until military authorities explained the incident.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF

Mr. [REDACTED]
