The text in the document is as follows:

"UNCLASSIFIED

1. I am transmitting in the electronic field under contract to the United States Air Force as the contract project manager conducting a statistical study in the data relating to the sightings of unidentified flying objects in the San Pedro Harbor, California. I have been with this file for over four years.

2. On [REDACTED] I was personally on the scene in the evening. I wish to relate what I observed, and I wish to comment upon the meaning of some of the other data in this file.

*some text redacted*

They appear to have been made for a purpose which I surmised to be an attempt to mislead or confuse those who might eventually examine this file. It is my personal opinion, based on four years' experience, that there is a great deal of data in this file which can be considered valid information concerning unidentified flying objects. I believe this file contains important information which should be made available to qualified technical personnel for detailed study and analysis.
