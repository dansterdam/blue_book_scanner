STATEMENT

On Friday, 1 August 1952, at approximately 1000 hours, I noticed a flying object in the sky. The altitude of the aircraft was impossible for me to estimate but appeared to be considerably above the cloud layers which was reportedly 2200 ft. The object was observed for approximately 25 to 30 seconds. The aircraft was heading in a northeasterly direction. After I observed the object for a short period of time, it increased in speed tremendously and disappeared in a northeast direction, about 1 and 1/2 minutes.
