There is no photograph present in this image. The image shows a handwritten document page from what appears to be a Project Blue Book UFO report.

Here is the OCR text from the document:

I am still amazed at the shape that this object presented. It seemed to change shape and color as it moved along. At one time it was round, then it would change to the shape of an egg, then to a crescent, then to a cigar shape. The color would change from bright white to reddish orange to bluish green. It never hovered or stopped. It just kept moving at a terrific speed, disappearing in a matter of seconds. I can't understand why it was not picked up on radar. The officers stationed at the Air Base said they had no unusual radar contacts that night. I was so excited I could hardly take notes, but I tried to put down as much detail as I could remember. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter further with your investigators. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
