The Density of the Upper Atmosphere*
By
Theodore E. Sterne**

1. Introduction
This shall present a formula for the inference of air density from the orbital motion of artificial satellites of earth such as satellites kindly provided me by Dr. Charles A. Whitney.

2. A Formula for Inferring Atmospheric Density from the Motion of Artificial Earth Satellites
In a paper in press the author has made a basis theoretical study of the effects of air resistance upon the motion of close earth satellites. The first equation of Section 2 or that paper is

Δ a = -α'(a/p)2 (r/Ro) (1+e cos E)3/2 dlp (1)
        Ro (1-e cos E)1/2

Where a and p are the mean distance of the satellite orbit and its eccentricity, respectively; where Δ is an operator denoting the increase in quantity upon which it operates, where r is the earth's equatorial radius, and where E is the eccentric anomaly. In equation (1) c is the

* The Formula and conclusions about atmospheric density, in this article, have been communicated to Science.
