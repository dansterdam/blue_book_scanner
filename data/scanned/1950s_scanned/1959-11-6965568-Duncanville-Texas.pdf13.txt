The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, with a hand-drawn sketch in the center.

The text in the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound - N/D
b. Color - Silver

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially show if trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One):   a. Fuzzy or blurred   b. Like a bright star   c. Sharply outlined   d. don't remember

19. If there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there? Draw a picture of how they were arranged, and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

No image is included in the text. The text appears to be a survey form for reporting observations of unidentified flying objects.
