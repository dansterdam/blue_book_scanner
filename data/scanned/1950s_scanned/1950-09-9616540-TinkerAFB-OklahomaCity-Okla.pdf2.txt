AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Sighting of an Unidentified Aerial Object, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

19 October 1950

Prepared by: Percy Y. Sutton, Captain, USAF

a. At approximately 2152 CST, 18 September 1950, an unidentified aerial object was observed over the vicinity of Tinker AFB, Oklahoma. The object was sighted by 1 Sgt Randall D. Fowler of the Intelligence Section of the 513th Reconnaissance Squadron.

b. When first sighted, the aerial object appeared to be at a position of approximately 300 to 400 feet, moving in a north and northwest direction at a speed estimated to be from 300 to 400 mph. In appearance the object resembled an elongated area of luminosity with indistinct definition.

c. As the object passed directly above the observer, in its northwesterly flight, there appeared to be jerky sideward movements. The object was observed for approximately 10,000 feet continuing in the northwest direction.

d. Clear skies up to 25,000 feet were reported at the time of the observation.

A check of local air installations on the following morning revealed that no local aircraft were known to be aloft at the time of the observation.
