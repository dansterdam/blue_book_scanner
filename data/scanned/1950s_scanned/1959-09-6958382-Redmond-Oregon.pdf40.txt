NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE
ON AERIAL PHENOMENA
WASHINGTON 6, D. C.
December 31, 1959

Major Lawrence J. Tacker
Department of the Air Force
Office of Public Information
Pentagon,
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Major Tacker: 

It was reported in local papers and on the newswires that a UFO was seen on the morning of September 24th by a police patrolman and an FAA flight service specialist in Redmond, Oregon. The regional FAA office in Seattle, Washington, reported that the object was tracked on radar for about two hours, and that Air Force jets were scrambled from Portland Air Base on an attempted intercept.

In view of the radar tracking and the involvement of FAA and Air Force personnel, I assume that ATIG has studied the case. What is the conclusion of ATIG? 

Secondly, you mentioned earlier this year that the Air Force Project Twinkle had considered the possibility that the so-called "green fireballs" were ice meteorites. Their conclusions had not been released at the time, but you said the project would close down this year. Since -- theories along the same line, in Air Force magazine and elsewhere, are claiming that most UFOs are explainable as chunks of ice from space, we would like to have the official Air Force position on this matter, including the conclusions of Project Twinkle.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,
[signed]
Secretary of NICAP
