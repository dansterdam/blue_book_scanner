JOHNSON, BILLY R. PPC. US 27-2-21
Headquarters Company, 76th Battalion, 19th Infantry

One day at OS 211 (OB-2-11) on 6 November 1955 at about 20:00 hrs, the observer, Johnson, was outside where he could observe the terrain and he noticed a bright light, about 6 inches in diameter, coming down from the sky. It came down and hovered about 4 feet above the ground, and then moved around, first to the left, then to the right, then back to the left, hovering all the time, and seemed to be searching for something. It then moved up and down, and back and forth, in an apparent aimless manner, for approximately 5 minutes. Suddenly, it shot up into the sky, going up at a 45 degree angle, and disappeared.

The observer, Johnson, said that the object was about 6 inches in diameter, and was a very bright light, giving off a bluish-white glow. It seemed to be intelligently controlled, and did not appear to be any known aircraft. Johnson said that he had never seen anything like it before, and that it was not a star, planet, or any other celestial body that he was familiar with.
