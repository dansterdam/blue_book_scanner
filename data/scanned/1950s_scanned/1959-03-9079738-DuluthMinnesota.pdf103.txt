DATE: 15 MAR 1957

Where was CADO case 907 dated 1-12-57 which indicated a satellite 'with the body and tail of one of the Russian Sputniks of 1957' and with a long trailing 'flame' had been observed by a radar operator at Goose Bay Labrador at 0305Z on 1-11-57? This observation was made upon the same night, at the same place, by the same radar operator and the description of the object is almost identical with the 'Sputnik' case. On that night the 'Sputnik' had been observed for a period of 30 minutes, with the tail glowing brightly. What observations, if any, were made of this second satellite or probe by the Airforce in this area, and what was the explanation, if any, given by the authorities? The satellite or probe moved rapidly in the same general direction as the 'Sputnik' of the previous night, and was under observation by the radar operator for approximately 5 minutes, and was confirmed by visual observation."
