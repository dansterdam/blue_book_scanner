The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed letter from the United States Air Force's Project Blue Book, which was the official project for investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

10 November 1959

Dear Mr.

This is to acknowledge your letter of 3 November 1959 concerning Unidentified Flying Objects.

The report you submitted is too old to evaluate. However, the Air Force did receive a report from Wisconsin in September 1957 regarding a sighting which was similar to what you observed. This is probably what you observed.

For your information I am including the latest Department of Defense release on UFOs which clearly states the Air Force position on this subject.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
