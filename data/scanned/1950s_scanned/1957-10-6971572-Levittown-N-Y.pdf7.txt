AF Believes 'Fireball' Was Meteor
"The North American Air Defense Command said today the "fireball" reported in the sky over Pennsylvania Thursday morning was probably a meteor.
The Air Force investigating team which rushed to the area said they found no evidence of any crash or debris from a plane. They reported the object was probably a meteor which broke up as it entered the atmosphere.
Residents of Levittown, Pa., and surrounding areas had reported seeing a bright object streaking across the sky and apparently breaking up.
"It was a run-away satellite or meteor," said the Air Force. "We found no evidence of any airplane accident." The command said the "fireball" had been tracked on radar."
