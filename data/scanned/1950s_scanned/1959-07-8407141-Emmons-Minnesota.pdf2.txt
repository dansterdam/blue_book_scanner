17 September 1959

Dear Mr. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge and thank you for your letters of 29 July and 2 September 1959.

There are no still or motion pictures available for loan. Suggest you contact the owners of film submitted to Air Technical Intelligence Center for evaluation as it is always returned.

The object you refer to which was found in Minnesota was a magnesium anode. This was not a tentative identification, but a final evaluation in this case.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
