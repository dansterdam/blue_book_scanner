INT 373.5 (S). "Unidentified Flying Object". (cont)

observed on the CPS-4 height-finder before being observed on the CPS-6 surveillance radar system. This appears logical and field experience, inasmuch as the high altitude coverage of the CPS-6 is known to be poor and the antenna of the CPS-4 is not capable of being automatically tilted as in the case of the CPS-6 - on which the controller may tilt the antenna within wide limitations to observe any high altitude objects. It is indicated on the radar set has indicated that targets picked up at ranges and altitudes indicated in subject report would probably have a reflection aspect ratio in the order of magnitude of a B-29 or greater.

 "For the absence of detailed vertical and horizontal coverage-age charts for the specific radar under discussion and comprehensive weather reports for the period covered in the report, a more completed study of this evaluation at this time is not feasible."

"In summary, no known electronic phenomena, nor combinations of several electronic phenomena could conceivably produce all of the observations covered by the attached reports."

"The frequency of reports of this nature has recently increased: instructions have therefore been directed to all radar installations within this command to report unidentified objects sightings."

5. It is recommended that reports of unidentified object sightings be reconsider for submission from all Zone of Interior Air Force agencies.
