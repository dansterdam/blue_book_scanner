This image appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document. It does not contain any visible photographs or images, only handwritten text. 

As an optical character recognition (OCR) system, I will now extract all the text found in the document:

This eliminates the possibility that such objects were the same balloons. The objects could not have been a single spot of light because it covered an area 175 miles in 10 minutes or so.

6:30 a.m.         6.45
11:5                12:610
10:2 - 6.30       4.30

A speed of 690 m.p.h. This is for a fit burning return recognizable from the further.
