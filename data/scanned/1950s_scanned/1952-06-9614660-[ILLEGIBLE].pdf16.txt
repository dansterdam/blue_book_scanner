Arthur Bidlack, 1952
Batt. 2-4th Arty. Div. (Mc 282)
Middleboro, Pa.

June 25, 1952

The night of June 20, 1952, at 11:35 o'clock, my husband and I observed a strange object in the sky which I shall describe.

The object was oblong in shape and moved rapidly and silently. It had no lights as such, but the object itself appeared to glow, somewhat like a fluorescent light. Its path was erratic and it made sudden turns and stops. This strange object was in sight for several minutes before disappearing.
