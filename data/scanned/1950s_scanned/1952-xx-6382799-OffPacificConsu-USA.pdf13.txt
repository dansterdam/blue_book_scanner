APPARITION OF A FLYING SPHERE

On the 28th of August 1952, the following article of mine was published in the largest daily newspaper of Milan (Corriere Della Sera):
Westerly passing, 27th of August, at 21:15 hours, I was walking as usual along the Corso Buenos Aires, towards the Piazza Cavour, when suddenly my attention was attracted by a bright-red luminous body in the sky, over the direction of Corso Venezia. I stopped and observed that it was a flying sphere which, after a few seconds, raced at a tremendous speed and disappeared behind the buildings. The light was steadier and larger than a star, and remained visible for about three minutes. Suddenly my attention was attracted by a transparent small cloud, circular in shape, which moved quickly and silently through the sky, leaving no trail. The cloud had an extraordinary brightness and luminosity which seemed to depart from the milky way. It increased rapidly in size and seemed to approach my position with a rotational movement. The cloud soon disappeared in the western part of the sky. As I stood still watching, I suddenly observed another luminous body, similar to the first one, which raced perpendicularly from the west to the east, at the same tremendous speed and disappearing again behind the buildings. I estimated the speed of the first sphere at approx. 1000 kph. The second sphere showed the same luminous characteristics, but seemed smaller in size. After a few seconds it too disappeared in the same manner as the first one. The two objects seemed to come from different directions but their rapid movements and the brevity of their apparitions defied precise observation. They were high-speed prodigy-like apparitions, which, however, must be considered as real facts, even though their origin and nature remain unexplained.

MAY FIRST IDEA WAS THAT SUCH A PHENOMENON WAS DUE TO A VERY PRECISE TECHNICAL DEVICE, CONTROLLED BY A HUMAN INTELLIGENCE, COMING FROM ABOVE AND DISAPPEARING IN THE SKIES IN AN ASTOUNDING MANNER, COMPLETELY MYSTERIOUS. LATER ON, HOWEVER, I WAS INCLINED TO ADMIT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MAY APPEAR WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTS BEING CONDUCTED ON UPPER ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA, IN COURSE OF WHICH EXTRAORDINARY APPARITIONS COULD BE CAUSED, EVEN IF CARRIED OUT AT VERY HIGH ALTITUDES, FOR EXAMPLE 50 OR 60 KILOMETERS ABOVE THE EARTH'S SURFACE (?). ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THESE PHENOMENA WERE ALREADY KNOWN TO CERTAIN SCIENTIFIC CIRCLES, MIGHT IT NOT BE WORTHWHILE TO INVESTIGATE THEM FURTHER, IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THEIR TRUE ORIGIN AND NATURE. WOULD IT NOT BE USEFUL THAT MEN OF SCIENCE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION, IN AN IMPARTIAL AND SERIOUS MANNER, THESE OBSERVATIONS, WHICH SEEM TO BE REAL FACTS AND NOT EFFECTS OF IMAGINATION OR OPTICAL ILLUSIONS.

There is no doubt that these may be a more optical illusion as dissiped by the testimony of numerous persons who observed the phenomenon at the same time as myself. I personally regard these high-speed apparitions as real facts and am convinced they represent a highly interesting and worthwhile subject for scientific investigation, in order to ascertain their true origin and nature.
