being 230 feet over a 50 foot obstacle. An experimental model of the
aircraft was built for the Navy and designated XF5U-1. The rate of
climb obtained during flight tests did not meet expectations due to the
extremely high-induced drag inherent in low aspect ratio wings. The
take-off distance did check out to be very low. The project was 
dropped with the advent of high speed jet aircraft.

The pure delta-wing in which many U. S. companies have shown
an interest also appears to have a high induced drag factor although
there is some evidence that this can be alleviated somewhat by round-
ing the wing tips. Convair is carrying on an active project
(F-92) to determine the flying characteristics of a pure delta-wing
aircraft. To date, fairly successful results have been obtained and
they have been awarded a development contract for a delta-wing
all-weather fighter.

Names always good for a look of interest in aeronautical
circles are those of the Horton Brothers and Herr Lippisch. These
two design teams began in the early thirties to build and fly various
all-wing gliders in Germany.
