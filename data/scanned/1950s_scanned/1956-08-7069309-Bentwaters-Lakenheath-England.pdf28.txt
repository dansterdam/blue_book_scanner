The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

"1. To be forwarded...been detected with a speed estimated 4 to 5 times the speed of sound...

2. The reported sighting is considered and apparently could be explained as follows:
     a. The personne were observed and apparently could be interpreted as meaning they saw objects...
     b. The two personne are now of opinion they saw an aircraft..., during the period between 21st and 29th of August.
     c. In interviews afterwards, it seems the individuals might, at first, have overestimated about the observed object, but later, their impressions were considerably modified.

d. It is possible that the object sighted were Air Force aircraft conducting high altitude or supersonic flights in the area at that time.

e. Although collating the several reports, there does not appear to be sufficient evidence to indicate the presence of unconventional aircraft or missiles in the area during the period in question."
