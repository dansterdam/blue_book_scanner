U.S. Fires Research Rocket
3-Stage Missile Goes 150 Miles Into Atmosphere
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10--(UP)--A five-stage Army research rocket successfully fired 150 miles into the upper atmosphere today.
The rocket, launched by the Army Ordnance Missile Laboratories, reached an altitude of over 150 miles, it was announced. This is believed to be the highest altitude ever attained by a U.S. missile.
The vehicle was launched by the Army in cooperation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to measure atmospheric densities. The data would be valuable in the intercontinental ballistic missile and satellite programs.
The five-stage missile, smaller than a five-story building, was developed at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, Redstone Arsenal, Ala. It was used for satellite launching and military shots of intercontinental ballistic missiles.
The rocket was fired at 7 a.m. and finally plunged into the Atlantic Ocean about 300 miles away from the launching site. The rocket was designed to reach an altitude of 150 miles.
IN ANNOUNCING the shoot, the Defense Department said the experiment was planned by various agencies in connection with the U.S. program for the International Geophysical Year cooperation in 1959. Information on the experiment will be made available to all nations participating in the international geophysical year program.
