The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from a report or document related to Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

6. Report does not indicate whether the observer, using intelligence facilities available to him as a Pilot Intelligence Officer, made checks or queries to determine if aircraft, craft or vehicles in the area were part of regular air traffic in the area. These investigations can be better conducted in the area of origin than are the 21 Dec 57 checks.

7. Object was not a meteor or a passing satellite as implied. The time duration of 15 minutes while these objects remained aloft, longer than 6-9 seconds, the earth entry velocity of the satellite would be between 18-20,000 MPH. 

CONCLUSIONS: From the limited information given, and lack of investigative data, and file conclusions can be made regarding the identity of the light; other than that it appeared to be Venus and a jet. Reasons for this conclusion, this was probably due to the fact that the observations were intermittent and changes in the objects' bearing resulting from the travel of the car.
