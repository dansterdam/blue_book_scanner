Dear President Kennedy:

In November 1951, I saw for a full 3 minutes a strange space ship, directly overhead. I think I have knowledge of how it worked and I am sending it on to you in the hope it might help us with our space program.

The ship looked about 100 feet long, about 60 feet high at the center. Its outside were covered with metal plates which were alternately made hot and cold. By account of the operation of the ship: 
What the outside metal plates were made of electrically separated positive proton particles and when the outside revolving ring at the very center of the space craft was revolved at very high speed the ship would climb upward when the ring showed down
the ship would descend.

The ship was creating electrical opposition to the positive atomic attraction force of the earth's attraction. The center revolving ring had metal plates spaced about every two feet which pushed the outside metal plates of the ship.

I noticed that the faster the ring spun, the lighter the whole outside of the ship lifted up. This is the most amazing part. To move the ship forward, it seemed as though pulses of negative electricity were charged into the tail section and because the revolving ring at the center was the most positive the electricity flowed rapidly from the tail to the center of ship.

Since gravity can pull only on a negative charge what was happening was that gravity was made to pull horizontally from tail to center of ship and this is what made the ship move forward. When they wanted to bring the ship to a stop or make it fly backwards it was attracted backwards to the revolving ring at the center forcing the ship backwards.
