The image does not contain any photograph, but rather a handwritten letter. I will now proceed to extract all the text from the document:

Dear Sir:
Enclosed are the considered reports to the effect that I cannot remember the exact date when I had my first sitter in Tipp [City?] or when I received the information that the Government had created a special section to investigate UFOs. 
To begin with, there is not much I could possibly give, as we were hardly ever made privy to the real activities of this branch and knew only what was allowed to filter through. We could possibly give a clue as to where the most concentration of these investigations took place, but beyond that I do not feel we could be of much help.
Sincerely,
[Redacted]
