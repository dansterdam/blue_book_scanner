WHO ELS3 SAW THIS? 

With my two eyes wide open, in full possession of my senses and as sober as any self-respecting judge should be, I saw what, to the best of my knowledge and belief, no one else has ever seen outside of the pages of a science-fiction magazine!

I will say this much, from where I witnessed the astounding phenomenon, I looked around to see if there were others looking skyward-- not a single soul. I was standing on the sidewalk alongside the parking-lot on Wilcox Avenue. On Hollywood Boulevard, a quarter of a block away, looking south, I could see people walking East and West. They walked fast. They walked slowly. They looked at each other. They looked down; around; in the shop windows; but, no one looked up! No one looked any higher than to another pair of eyes! A couple passed me, going in the opposite direction on Wilcox. They were looking at each other. Directly across the street a lone man stood before the show-window of a bookstore (since removed). His eyes were glued to the gaudy book-jackets on display. And throughout all this human indifference to anything outside of their circumscribed ambience, the most sensational actual event in all history could have been witnessed by lifting their eyes to Earth's constant companion and fellow-traveler-- the MOON.

I stood there looking skyward, speechless! Struck mute by the awesome spectacle which lay before me. I cannot reveal what I saw, for there are so many who would not believe, or, believing, would not understand. This much I will say: Mankind is not alone!
