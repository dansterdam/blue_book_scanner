Dover Air Force Base, Delaware                                                                                      26 February 1953

I. Description of Incident

At 2130 EST a dull red colored light was observed low on the western horizon by several military personnel. The light was slowly moving from west to northwest alternating color from yellow, green, red, and back to white. After being observed for approximately five minutes, object disappeared below the horizon.

II. Discussion of Incident

Observers were, in the opinion of the preparing officer, reliable. At the time of sighting, weather was clear, visibility eight miles. F-94's in area on other missions noticed nothing unusual. Due to the fact that the light was seen moving from west to northwest low on the horizon and then to disappear over the horizon and that the planet Venus can be seen in that direction very plainly during this part of the year, it is quite certain that the light observed was Venus. ATIC's contract astronomer was consulted and he concluded that the object observed was definitely Venus.

III. Conclusion

Astronomical - Venus.
