COMMENT NO. 1

1. Enclosed is a radar sighting on 13 Feb 53 from Carswell AFB, Texas, concerning radar blips picked up by 5-55 radar. In conformity with this report, your office states that the radar information supplied was insufficient for identifying the objects observed and suggests that the targets concerned may have been identified as aircraft. No other definite conclusions or identifications were made and additional information needed and incloses it herewith.

2. According to this information the targets in question were moving and also a certain amount of ground clutter or "notational" present. Project Blue Book requests whether temperature inversion was present or any other phenomena known to you could have caused this sighting.
