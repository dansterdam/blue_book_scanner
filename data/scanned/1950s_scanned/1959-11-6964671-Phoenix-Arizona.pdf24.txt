[Transcription of the text in the document:]

"a part they appeared to be doing while hovered over a few feet, but suddenly rising straight up into sky - very rapid climb, and lost to sight in a few seconds. A dozen or so hovering at about 2000 ft. altitude in a strange formation like a bunch of grapes, moving about here and there - climbing, circling, then hovering again - finally one by one shooting straight up and away. A few of them a dazzling silvery color. There was a kind of iridescent shell around them at times, something like mother-of-pearl effect. Not ony my own observation, but witnessed by a number of other persons. They seemed utterly unconcerned about being observed. That baffled me - as to why they were so indifferent to being seen. I wish I could give you more detail, but that's about all I can recall. You probably know far more about these things than I do."
