1. Following information is offered in reply to basic communication:
a. Aranda is a small village near Pasto in Southwest Colombia, 3 days driving and approximately 2 hours flying time from Bogota, with no commercial aviation scheduled. As the underlined is not, assigned an aircraft and the only facilities are a native airstrip, it was impossible for military personnel to arrive and practice light artillery firing.
b. SIC is the abbreviation of the name of the National Colombian Security Police. Interview with the officers of SIC in Bogota indicates that no information is available to the Colombian Government concerning the Aranda-Pasto incident. The practice light artillery firing was accomplished by the Colombian Army Military Group stationed at Pasto in the vicinity of Pasto and Aranda for several days around 6 July.
c. It is indicated that fragments mentioned in basic communication may possibly be fragments of 60mm or 20mm tracer used in the practice firing. It is known from personal experience in viewing demonstrations in Bogota that 60mm tracer ammunition was fired without any consideration for civilian safety in case of short rounds.
