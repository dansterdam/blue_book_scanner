AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

NORWALK, CONN.

PAGE 1 OF 5 PAGES

"Girl" finished staining model ship. The information was revised that this "girl" related that she had been walking on the beach near 5:30 PM on 27 September 1952 when she observed a metallic, silvery disc-shaped object which made a sudden ascent from the water and flew off rapidly. She said the object was about 25 feet in diameter, was hovering about 75 feet above the water and made no noise. After it ascended rapidly, it was about the size of a nickel held at arm's length. She said it left no vapor trail, no exhaust, and no sign of propulsion. She said that during the time she observed this object, approximately 1 to 2 minutes, a boat which was about 1/4 mile off shore also observed the object as it ascended rapidly.

The reporting officer stated that the subject was very calm, rational, and lucid in her story and that he could find no reason to doubt her sincerity or credibility. He stated that the girl appeared to be intelligent, honest, and quite positive in her description of the incident.

The reporting officer also stated that at the time this incident occurred there was a 12 to 15 knot wind blowing onshore and surface waves about 2 to 3 feet high, and that the object appeared to rise vertically from the surface of the water.

He concluded his report by stating that this incident constitutes a good sighting of a UAO (Unidentified Aerial Object) which he believes deserves further study and investigation.
