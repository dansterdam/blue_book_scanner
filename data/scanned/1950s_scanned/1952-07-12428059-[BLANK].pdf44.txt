MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: No.

THE PRESS: Can you get a good return from a re-
flected ground target, General?

MAJOR GENERAL SAMFORD: I'll ask Captain James --

CAPTAIN JAMES: You can get a very large return from
a reflected ground target.

THE PRESS: Just as good as you might get from an
object actually in flight in the air?

CAPTAIN JAMES: Actually thicker. It depends on
the amount of bending.

THE PRESS: And just as sharp on the scope?

CAPTAIN JAMES: Yes.

THE PRESS: Can you get a blip from the (inaudible)
created by temperature inversion?

CAPTAIN JAMES: On the ground target, yes.

THE PRESS: In other words, something that's on the
ground that's reflected off a refracted cloud bank would throw
off a blip on the radar screen?

CAPTAIN JAMES: Yes, sir. That's true.

THE PRESS: Would a nearby radar set get that blip
at exactly the same speed?

CAPTAIN JAMES: Not necessarily, no.

THE PRESS: In other words, you can have a light and
something that lacks substance and material and still have a
blip?

CAPTAIN JAMES: I don't quite understand that question.

THE PRESS: You can have a radar image that's created
without the necessity of radar striking the solid object or a
semi-solid, such as a cloud?

CAPTAIN JAMES: Well, eventually, it does have to
strike an object.
