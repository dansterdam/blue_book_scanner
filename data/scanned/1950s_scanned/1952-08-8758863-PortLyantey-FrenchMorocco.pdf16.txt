STATEMENT OF LT. GR. B. GREEN

On the night of August 6, 1952 while standing in the squadron area (VR-24, about 2300), I saw a brilliant round white light going on a course of about 250 degrees. It left a white, smoke-like trail which lasted until after the object itself was gone. I have seen T-33's and P-94's in action and can safely say it was going far faster than any of these.
