The first observers were workers at the airport of Orly, France, near Paris. They noticed bright lights in the sky at 7:30 P.M. of Feb. 29th, 1956. The lights, circling rapidly, could be seen going through maneuvers at an incredible speed. They were estimated to be 1,200 miles per hour. The objects were picked up Friday night by radar operators at Orly International Airport. The Air Force spokesman said the objects, apparently metallic, were not foreign aircraft observed in this area before, and there is no satisfactory explanation as to their identity. Radar observations indicate the objects were beyond the capacity of the fastest jets to intercept.
