PICTURES OFFER PROOF
Vet Sees Flying Objects in
Sky and Photographs Them

A Fort Worth man Monday said he saw flying objects in the sky near the Pacific, reported to be six or seven miles away, and took pictures of them.
Ira Maxey, of 916 5th Ave., a veteran radar bombardier, said he and his wife saw the objects in the sky about 6:30 p.m. Sunday in two groups, coming out of the west and traveling northeast. 
Maxey said he had his camera at the ready and happened to get some sort of aircraft, a type which he had never seen before.
The pictures showed that the objects appeared to be six or seven miles away, he said, and they were moving at a great speed, making a thunderous sound. After a few photographs the objects disappeared from view, Maxey stated.
