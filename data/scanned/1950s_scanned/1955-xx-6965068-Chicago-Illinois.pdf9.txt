TACKER to an individual regarding the report of a possible unidentified flying object. The letter discusses the process of investigating the sighting and requests the individual to provide additional information to aid in the analysis.

The text of the document is as follows:

20 April 1960

Dear Mr. *****, 

This is to acknowledge your letter of 3 April 1960 which gave details of your sighting of a possible unidentified flying object.

The procedure we follow in such cases is to have a thorough analysis made of the sighting. This positive identification is so important that we will have to ask you to provide us with all the information you can on this particular sighting.

In addition, we will need more information with regard to the circumstances under which the sighting was made. We will need a description of the object, its size, shape, color, speed, direction of travel, duration of sighting, etc. The Air Force Questionnaire included herewith should be carefully completed with respect to this UFO sighting.

When this is accomplished, please send the questionnaire and the negative, if any, to the Air Force Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
