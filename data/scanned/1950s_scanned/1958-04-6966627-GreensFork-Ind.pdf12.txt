DISPOSITION FORM

FILE NO.:
SUBJECT: Request for Analysis and Identification - Purported Meteorite
FROM: AFCIN-4322
TO: AFCIN-4322
DATE: 23 Apr 58

1. Request subject specimen be subjected to necessary studies and tests to determine whether it is of meteoritic origin and, if so, whether predominantly or of the "stony" or "nickel-iron" type.

2. The Air Force interest in these bodies is well known, particularly of the latter. 

3. Attached are certain documents showing some background and previous action taken to possibly assist you in this matter.

2 Incls:
1. Specimen in wooden box
2. Misc litrs.

1. Examination of subject specimen has revealed that it is a glacial boulder of crystallization materials. These results were obtained at great distance from the locality of their natural occurrence or original outcroping, having been transported by glacial action during the Ice Age glaciation.

2. Specifically, the specimen is a normal basalt, compact in formation and greenish-black in coloration, containing inclusions of plagioclase laths and olivine (a green magnesium-iron silicate) or chromite, suggesting a contact differentiation origin, limonite (brown hydrated iron ore) and pyroxene (iron-silicate). It has a density of approximately 2.85 to 3.0, and sulphurization have caused the reduction of certain iron minerals which is, however, typical of weathered and exposed iron-bearing rock.

3. All true meteorites show the effects of aerodynamic heating in reaching the earth's surface to a more or less severe extent, resulting in pitting and surface fusion. This specimen bears none of these evidences and has been concluded to be of earthly and not of extraterrestrial origin.
