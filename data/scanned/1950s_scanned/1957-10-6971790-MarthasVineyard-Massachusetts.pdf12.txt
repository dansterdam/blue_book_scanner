Request by: The Air Technical Intelligence Center
General: The Air Technical Intelligence Center is in receipt of information which would normally provide sufficient data for identification or analysis, concerning the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Report submitted to the Commanding General, USAF, by the Commanding Officer, 14 Nov 1957 (Cont).

1. Cooperative analysis of basic data reveals certain inconformities and difficulties in analyses.

2. Photographs: No photographic data is contained in the ATIC report. Additional photographic data could not be located. If available, visual observation report would be required: spherical or oval by distance; Description of protrusions: wing tips, antenna, etc. Course of object: heading, speed, altitude.

3. Wind Directions: UNR Report: Blowing from W - NW (10-15,000 ft alt).

4. Factual Data in Support of Final Conclusion: Clear, bright, no clouds; unlimited visibility; duration about 10-15 minutes; object was observed going in westerly direction, disappearing to the west of the observers. The fact that no vapor exhaust trail was admitted rules out possibility of aircraft.

5. Analysis of similar types of UFO reports over a period of more than 10 years has shown that these reports result in significant off-the-mark conventional object identification, many inconclusive or completely unidentifiable, and an unknown percentage which may very well represent some new phenomenon under various atmospheric conditions. A review of the simple explanatory sketch is attached which may be some value in understanding more fully the nature of these phenomena, which weather unit locations and acts in a similar learning balloon actions indicate a rhumhle in elevation and oscillating path, often gives an impression of a free-floating object.
