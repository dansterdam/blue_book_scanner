Congratulations on your NICAP article - the most sensible thing I have seen in SAUCER NEWS in ages. When NICAP was first organized, I was excited that we might soon contact ed by several crack-dots, and was sorry I never got into the thing. Our little group here in Chicago seized on NICAP several months ago, and when we read in his bulletin that he was going to sell the "*****-books," I think Major Keyhoe means well, but he sure hasn't done the job we expected of him.

You've done it again with your NICAP article, I never thought you'd have the nerve to attack that bunch...but I see you did...In my opinion SAUCER NEWS is the only antidote to that sick thing without fear or favor...JOHN KETALLWLCH
