Stationary light at four (4) minutes after nine (9). Light moved to right at an unidiated speed, with a trail of light having
a point on the extreme end.
I was on the porch with W/Sgt Woodley, my house is located at 11 Old Main Road, Cherry Units. It did not in any way resemble
a vapor trail. This in my opinion as I am in no way qualified
as an observer.
