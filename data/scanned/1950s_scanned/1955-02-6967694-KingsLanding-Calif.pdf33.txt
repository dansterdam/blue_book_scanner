Transcription of the text in the document:

To Whom it may concern: 
The incident and flying object reported to me must be a genuine occurrence, since I am able to vouch for the things which have happened, since the detail furnished would render it a pretty good case for current consideration, and would merit a reply from me on this matter.

I came up by sighting that the "Aircraft 2" had no markings, and was not the property of the United States of America. This makes it belong to Intelligence or the Russians. Mr. President, with my sense of mind, good health, and continued contact with your endearing child.

Thanking you for your time and interest in the subject matter discussed herein.

Yours truly,
