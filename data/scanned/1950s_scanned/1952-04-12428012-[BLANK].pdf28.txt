---
now, although upon a somewhat different basis. Now, instead of 
dealing with individuals working apart, we have an arrangement 
with a civilian research institution of top standing and reputation, 
to handle this part of the analysis for us. This institution has 
a group or "panel" of scientific personnel in many differing 
specialties -- astronomers, physicists, chemists, even psychologists -- 
who work in close collaboration in considering incidents that are 
brought to their attention. This work is done upon a consultant 
contract basis. It is a relatively new departure -- one of the 
improved methods we are putting into operation as rapidly as 
possible -- and while it is not in full swing as yet, we have every 
reason to entertain high hopes of this analysis method.
