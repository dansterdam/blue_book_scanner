COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER:
At approximately 0959 hours (JST) on 19 February 1958, an unknown phenomena was believed to have occurred at a US radar site in JAPAN. The phenomena lasted approximately two hours. This office concurred with the information by Technical Advisory as being of intense interest in connection with possible seismic/volcanic phenomena associated with the Kunashiri and Paramushiru areas. As no barometric or seismic changes indicative of an explosion at the time were noted, the relative information was obtained from the Maritime and Air Staff Offices of the Defense Agency. Officials of the Intelligence Agency stated that any barometric change would be detected at weather stations in JAPAN. (A similar indication of a nuclear explosion was believed for seismic detection of USSR nuclear explosion.)
