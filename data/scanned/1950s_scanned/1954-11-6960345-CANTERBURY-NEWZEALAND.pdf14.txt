Canterbury, New Zealand

Dear Sir,
I enclose a sketch made by
Mr. Intelligent Gentry,
A witness, picture as true to
his observation as he could
make. 
On Saturday, 18th June, 1955.
I saw a metallic object hanging at about 10,000 feet 
at Rakaia. The object appeared to be approximately 
40-50 feet in length, bullet shaped and seemed to be 
hovering without noise. It remained stationary for about
10 minutes and then took off at terrific speed in a
westerly direction leaving no trail. Believe report may
be of interest.

Yours sincerely,
[Signature redacted]

Case: Sighted right in Southern Alps at 5:15pm, where
Old Land Survey station exists. Object hovering for about
10 minutes and then shot off at terrific speed. Trail 
observed by 3 observers flying. Ends.
