The photograph depicts a woman, presumably Signora Danielli, in the company of her family inside a home setting. She appears to be recounting her experience with the alleged little men to her husband, who is holding a small child on his lap, and another child is present as well.

NOW THEY'RE IN ITALY

Astral intruders are depicted by local artist

They had been in France and now over the Alps into Italy they came, only 1,376 years behind Hannibalâ€™s elephants. The astral adventurers in flying saucers who so upset the French (LIFE, Nov. 1) had moved on. In the Tuscan village of Buccine two dwarfs popped out of a spaceship-shaped conveyance and accosted Signora Rosa Danielli. They snatched one of her silk stockings and also made off with some carnations she was carrying. Mrs. Danielli called the police. They listened. So did an artist for an Italian magazine, who imaginatively depicted the incident (below). Many other Italians have reported similar incidents (p. 13/4) involving flying disks, cigars and Mrmenut (Martians). The Italian air force, however, has reported that its radar, so far, has registered only recognizable aircraft.
