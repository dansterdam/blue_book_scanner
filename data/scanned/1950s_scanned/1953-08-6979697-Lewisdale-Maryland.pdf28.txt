27. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it. Place an "A" on the compass when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the compass when you last saw the object.

28. If the object STOPPED and changed direction, place an "X" on the beginning of the path, "Y" at the stop, and show any change in direction during the course.

29. If there were MORE THAN ONE object, how many were there?
Sketch the relative positions of the objects and put an arrow to show the direction they were traveling.
