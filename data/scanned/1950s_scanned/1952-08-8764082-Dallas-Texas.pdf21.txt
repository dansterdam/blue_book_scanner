The image contains two photographs. The first photograph shows a wide, open area with trees and vegetation. The caption states that this is a photo of the "first clearing and palmetto thicket" and that the direction of the thicket is unclear, so its extent could not be determined. The second photograph shows a dense palmetto thicket, with local citizens stating that it was "crawling" with vegetation.

Photograph No. 2 -- This shows the palmetto thicket at the approximate point referred to in the sketch. It gives an idea as to the height and density of the palmetto growth. Local citizens stated that it was 'crawling' with vegetation.

Photograph No. 1 - - This is a photo of the first clearing and palmetto thicket which was encountered on the way through the area. The direction of the thicket is unclear and, for so far as could be determined, this path might directly up to the center of the photograph into the palmetto thicket.
