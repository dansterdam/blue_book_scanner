September 12, 1952

Dear Major Tucker:

This letter is from the Air Technical Intelligence Center, stating that a U.F.O. was seen in the general vicinity of this station on September 12, 1952.

It is significant because it was at 2:44 this afternoon near this center and witnessed by two civilian investigators of the center, who have had extensive experience with a number of "flying saucers," and manned "Cirthon".

The statement is dated this date, and signed that, "witnesses of the United States Air Force were witnesses to this incident, and this is proof positive of their validity and consistency, in view of the fact they are excellent and constant observers."

I would appreciate moving all available details concerning the UFO report mentioned in ATIC's letter to you. I feel that it will do to research the above-mentioned sighting, as continued in Project Bluebook, the latest reports.

Sincerely,
