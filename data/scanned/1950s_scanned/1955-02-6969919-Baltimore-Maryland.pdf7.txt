BALTIMORE, MARYLAND Newspaper Article - DAILY SUN (Continued)

At the crime laboratory Lieut. Anthony F. Halligan said the substance was crystalline—like crystal shale—and that it resembled what is sometimes sent to Horgue. 

He sent the material to the City morgue, and last night Dr. Henry C. Freimuth, chemist at the laboratory, told him he had not yet seen a check on the material.

He described the material as "a powder" and said there was "about as much as it would take to cover a dime."

Sgt. Charles Ellison, who lives next door to Mrs. Shupe, said the bubbles from the sky were a mystery to him, too.

Mrs. Mamie Deriso, who lives next door to Mrs. Shupe, said she was told the same time as Ellison that the house next door was covered with the bubbles coming from the sky. 

Flower Gromer, who also lives at 1136 South Paca, said he figured the stuff came from a chemical plant. Bobby Shupe, Shupe's son who lives with his parents, said he thinks the material was some kind of fertilizer on the ground.
