The image does not contain any photograph or visual element. It appears to be a handwritten document, likely an excerpt from a UFO report or investigation. As an OCR system, I will now output the text found in the document:

"as being in the middle of it, one would pass by the light and not be able to see or feel it. It seemed to be a metallic light that gave off an intense heat that melted everything it came in contact with. The metal wreckage was still hot, and had to be handled with care.

Because the object was over water its shape could not be determined. The movements could be watched, but it was impossible to get close enough to determine its size. The object was watched for about three hours, and was very brilliant, giving off an intense light. It seemed to hover for a while, then descend swiftly, only to rise again with great rapidity. I don't think anyone would believe the tale, but the earth's atmosphere is constantly changing, and so there may be other things we cannot see.

Well, this was the main interest in the Bathtub Ranch - not the lights in the sky. I should not have mentioned that the complaint was not of an investigation made in 1944, and only a personal impression."
