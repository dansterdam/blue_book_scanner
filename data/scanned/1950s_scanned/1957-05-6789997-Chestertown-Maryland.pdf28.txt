OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

July 3, 1957

Dear Mr. Arcier:

Thank you for your letter of June 25, 1957, reporting on the findings of M/Sgt. O. D. Hill regarding the U. F. O. observed by me and my family at Chestertown, Maryland.

We are glad that Sgt. Hill was able to determine at least to his satisfaction the cause for our concern and interest in what we observed.

I am looking forward to receipt of the book that you are publishing on this whole subject when it is available for distribution. The public should receive considerable comfort from the thorough and careful manner in which the Air Technical Intelligence Center of the Air Force is approaching this matter.

With highest personal regards.
 
Sincerely yours,

[Signature Redacted]

Mr. A. Francis Arcier
Scientific Advisor
Air Technical Intelligence Center
United States Air Force
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio
