See Front Cover
A British school teacher and amateur astronomer has reported finding two new comets recently. The first was discovered after its appearance, George Alcock, is the brightest seen in several years. The second is a faint one and was picked up by Alcock on Sept. 15, 1959. 
The photograph on the cover of this issue shows Comet Alcock, 1959h, as seen at the U.S. Naval Observatory, Flagstaff, Ariz., on Sept. 10, 1959. The light lines are trails of stars, while the blob is the comet.
