There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing text describing a discussion about a vapor trail observed at Luke AFB.

The text in the document states:

M3240 FCR LUKE AFB SIGHTING

Project Blue Book personnel discussed the possibility of the vapor trail observed at Luke AFB being formed by a guided missile with the Missiles Section of ATIC on 21 June 1953. The topics of discussion centered around the following questions:

1) Is there a possibility of a missile being in the vicinity of Luke AFB? 2) Will a missile make this type of contrail at an altitude of 35,000?

The analysis of the Missiles Section stated that the charges are too small for a missile being in the vicinity of Luke AFB. Furthermore, a missile leaving its launching site would not leave a trail and it is shot down by planes to prevent its getting outside the testing grounds.

It was agreed that a missile does not make this type of trail at the above mentioned altitude. The analysts expressed their belief of the contrail being caused by two aircraft at a high altitude.

CONCLUSION: Object making the contrail was not a guided missile.
