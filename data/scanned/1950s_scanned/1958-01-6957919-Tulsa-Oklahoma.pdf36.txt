UNCLASSIFIED
14 January 1957

1. This is a summary of six (6) UFO reports submitted under the cover letters of the RECORD LIAISON, who received them from the RADAR ANALYSIS BRANCH file. Later dated 26 December 1956, subject: "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena".

2. Received by ATIC on 3 January 1957.

3. Reports range from almost two years (February 1954) for the oldest to over 7 months for the newest (August 1956). It appears that the G-2 had "pigeonholed" the reports for some unknown reasons before submitting them to the AEDC/ATIC.

4. The very late date of receipt makes investigations or conclusive analysis difficult, if not impossible. A preliminary evaluation made of each and entered in UFO files.
