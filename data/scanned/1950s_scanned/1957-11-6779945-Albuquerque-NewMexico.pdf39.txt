In Asuncion, Paraguay, a sighting was reported on February 7th by a student, Hector Torres, who saw a UFO land near a local school. The sighting was made by several other observers as well. The report states that the UFO was observed at high velocity, and five photographs of the UFO were taken in quick succession on the 8th of February. These photographs were published in the February 15th edition of "La Gaceta," a Tucuman newspaper.

The report also discusses a sighting that occurred in Tacuara, Paraguay, where "strange objects" were observed flying at relatively low speed at a distance of a half mile or so from the witnesses. A farmer named Ricardo Lopez, who lived a few miles from Tacuara, photographed these objects, and the report states that one meter is about equal to one yard. Lopez took several photographs, and the report states that a temperature of over 200 degrees Celsius had been placed on top of it, indicating that the objects were affected by extreme heat.

The report also mentions that sightings were made during January, and on the night of January 23rd, a huge object was sighted by a bus driver in Asuncion, Paraguay. The report states that the object was disc-shaped, with a white cabin, and several witnesses described it as being "cloud-shaped." The report also mentions that the object was observed for about an hour, during which it remained stationary above the vehicle.
