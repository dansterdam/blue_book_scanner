The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing a UFO sighting incident.

Both Mrs. Gardinier and a neighbor, Mrs. Lowell Allen, observed the third object as it silently appeared (suddenly appeared) at 7:35 PM. The object was rather flat, pancake-shaped, 20 to 30 feet across, and to about 5-10 feet thick. It back-lit in depth, then first appeared 10 feet in color, but then disappeared and seemed to come back, as it was difficult because the objects were constantly quivering and oscillating. They were capable of hovering and motionless in the air, except for the quivering motion. No sounds were heard. The witness could not identify the objects. No dust or other debris was associated with them and no trail could be seen. They appeared to have a high rate of speed, difficult to estimate because of lack of references as to size and distance away. No further observations were reported.

The text at the bottom of the page reads:
DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
DOD DIR 5200.10

And the document is marked as UNCLASSIFIED.
