Far-Ranging Radar Spots Sputnik III
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 16 - (UP) - Probing American tracking radar picked up Sputnik III and the booster rocket which propelled it into orbit.
The two Russian-made space vehicles, launched together over the United States tonight, were tracked by equipment at the Air Force Cambridge Research Center of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Project Minitrack hill installation, a part of the National Academy of Sciences network of satellite tracking stations around the world, picked up the larger of the two objects, apparently the booster, at 10:44 p.m. The Air Force said the object was some 800 miles from Millstone Hill, a range of about 1,200 miles.
The radar followed the path of the booster for the minutes it was north of New England, until it passed beyond Newfoundland at 10:50:15 p.m. toward Greenland.
The smaller object, presumably Sputnik III itself, was picked up by the Million-radar at 10:33:39 p.m. At the time it was in the sky northeastward beyond Newfoundland and 1,047 miles from Millstone Hill, from Westford and following the orbit of the bigger object.
Millstone detected radar signals from the satellite's transmitter at intervals as it passed overhead, enabling control teams to track the smaller object.
