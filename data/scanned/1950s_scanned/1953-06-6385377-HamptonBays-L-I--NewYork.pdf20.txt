At 10:20 A.M. today, both observers moved from the south to southeast by about 1/2 distance.

At 11:15 P.M. both observers moved from the south to northwest, 30 degrees west of the magnetic north.

At 12:00 P.M. both observers moved from north-northwest to their normal position north.

Friday, October 23, 1953.
Subject: Unidentified flying object (First reported in my report of October 17, 1953).

Time: 9:00 P.M. Friday & 1:30 A.M. Saturday, October 24, 1953.

About 9:00 P.M., sky overcast, moon hidden, visibility poor. I sighted an object which was silently hovering or stationary. I called to my husband, but they had been watching. They seemed to be watching the other direction.

Several times during the night I looked for them, but had no success in finding them again.

When around 1:30 A.M. I began spotting three of them, one on the Peninsula and two down by Fire Island Dunes (which I called again to my husband, but he still had not seen them.). 

They operated about the same as on the previous night. The Peninsula to Montauk Point on Long Island was the area they were working in.

Saturday, October 24, 1953.
Subject: They seemed to be on deck.

On inspecting our dock again today, my husband and I found sea-weed, clam shells, and fish scales in three locations, as if something had been there. They remained there until early evening, it had rained. These new scales are almost in the identical spots where the invisible ones found on the previous night. It seems to be some activity there, as there is no bird dirt.

Around 1:00 A.M. while we were watching, the small craft last night, my husband thinks he heard something move at the far end of our house. He quickly inspected, but saw or found nothing.
