Dear Mrs. G.C.

Dear Mrs.

We have read with much interest the informatioin concerning the 'flying saucer' seen by Mrs. Harrington, near Jerome, Ohio, on the 22nd of October, 1954. This is of particular interest to us in view of the fact that we had a similar experience on the same date about thirty miles away, in the vicinity of Wheelersburg, Ohio. 

The object was first observed at approximately 7:00 p.m. as a bright light moving in the southern sky. At first it appeared to be a star, but as it drew closer it became quite obvious that it was not a star. It seemed to be circular in shape, and emitted a brilliant bluish-white light, which pulsated or flashed at regular intervals.

The object appeared to be under intelligent control, as it made at least three abrupt changes in its direction of flight. It moved with tremendous speed at times, and at other times seemed to hover or remain stitionery in the sky. We watched it for several minutes, until it finally moved out of sight behind some trees.

There were three of us who witnessed this object, and we are all in complete agreement as to what we saw. We are quite familiar with all types of aircraft, and this was definitely not any type of conventional aircraft.

We would be very interested to know if there were any other sightings of this object, or similar objects, in the general area on the same date. If you have any information concerning this, we would greatly appreciate hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,
