```
On 14, 15 and 16 January 1953, upon request of the Director of
Intelligence of the Air Force a Scientific Advisory Panel was established.

The general conclusions reached by the panel were that unidentified
flying objects:

a. Held no direct physical threat

b. Were not foreign developments capable of hostile acts to the U. S.

c. Were not unknown phenomena requiring the revision of current
scientific concepts.

The panel further concluded that unless deemphasized, UFO's did
constitute a threat to the orderly functioning of the protective units
of the body politic, because:

a. Unwarranted mass of irrelevant reports could clog vital
channels of communications.

b. Skillful hostile propagandists could induce national hysterical
behavior or harmful distrust of duly constituted authority.

c. Continued false reports might hide indications of a genuine
hostile action.

As a result, the panel made the following basic recommendations:

a. That immediate steps be taken to strip UFOs of the aura of
mystery which they had unfortunately acquired, to reassure
the public of the total lack of evidence of inimical forces
behind the phenomena.

b. That investigating and reporting personnel be trained to
recognize and reject false indications quickly and effectively.
