UNCLASSIFIED
23 December 1958

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 27 November 1958 concerning your unidentified flying object sighting of 21 September 1958.

According to the Lorain Coast Guard Station log, the weather throughout the morning of 21 September 1958 was alternately misting and raining.

Also, a check with the Lorain railway station disclosed that a train passed your house, going west, at the time of your sighting. This train had a headlight that made figure eight oscillations. It is the opinion of the Air Technical Intelligence Center investigators that this was the light you observed.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
Major, USAF
Executive Officer
Public Information Division

Mrs. [redacted]
Sheffield Lake, Ohio
