The handwritten text in the description space reads:
"I was looking at the sky when I noticed a strange formation of lights which I called to the attention of other members of my family. We all saw the same thing. The lights appeared to be moving in an irregular pattern, changing directions abruptly and also slowing down and speeding up in a very erratic manner. I looked up and saw that they were larger than stars and also brighter. I could not make out any definite shape or outline, only a cluster of lights. At times, it looked as if they might be circling some invisible center, but I could not be certain of this. The lights appeared to be at a considerable distance and at a high altitude. I watched them for several minutes and then they seemed to disappear. I do not know if they went behind clouds or just faded from sight. I cannot offer any explanation for what I saw. It was most unusual and unlike anything I have ever observed before."
