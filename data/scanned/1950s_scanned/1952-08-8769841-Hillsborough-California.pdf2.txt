The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report describing a sighting of silver-gray objects shaped like a cross section of a cone, stopping and starting intermittently, and moving at an estimated speed of 1,500 mph. The objects were observed visually from the ground in Hillsborough, California at an approximate elevation of 500 ft. and an altitude of 12,000 ft.
