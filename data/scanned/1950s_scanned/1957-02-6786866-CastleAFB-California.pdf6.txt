  In accordance with established policies for the analysis of UFO reports, the attached teletype message from Castle AFB, California, is forwarded for your review and conclusions.

ATTN: Mr. Bryant/skb/te13

  The contents of the attached teletype have been carefully reviewed by this office. From the information that is available it is highly unlikely that anything they are asking for an analysis on would be of any particular scientific or technical merit. The attached data will probably add little or nothing to our current knowledge concerning UFO's, and as you know, we have processed literally thousands of similar types of reports previously. It is recommended that no further action be taken on the material forwarded herewith, and that this entire request be filed for record purposes only.

                 /s/ GORDON C. HOFFMAN
                 COLONEL, USAF
