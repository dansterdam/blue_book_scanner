1 December 1958

Dear Mr. -----,

Your letter of 8 November 1958 concerning an unidentified flying object (with included questioning) addressed to the Intelligences Center, has been referred to this office for reply.

A check was made with the Army Aviation Section. They have no helicopters, B-47s, stationed in the San Francisco area which are not based at very many locations, have an engine on each side of the fuselage driving one large rotor. It is our conclusion that you saw one of these aircraft flying in the area.

Thank you for your interest in the matter.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
