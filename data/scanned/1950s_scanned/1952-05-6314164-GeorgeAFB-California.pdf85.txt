Head T: Letters/Ltr 8 May 1952 - no air base shown do - Headquarters, USAF, Washington, DC, Subject: Unidentified Aerial Objects.

1. Reference is made to a letter dated 2 May 1952 from Hamilton Air Force Base, California, concerning Unidentified Aerial Objects observed near that base. 

2. The object as described in the referenced letter was photographed as it approached the base on 6 May 1952, the photograph being attached. According to the information furnished, the object appeared to be circular in shape, about the size of a medium bomber, and was traveling at a very high speed. The object was observed to make a steep climb and then level off and travel in a horizontal direction.

3. As the object is described as having been photographed, a print of the photograph should be forwarded to this headquarters for evaluation. The failure to include the photograph with the referenced letter rendered the report incomplete.

4. It is requested that any similar reports of Unidentified Aerial Objects, whether photographed or not, be forwarded to this headquarters as soon as possible.

5. A careful evaluation of all data received on Unidentified Aerial Objects is being made in this headquarters, and your continued cooperation in this matter is requested.
