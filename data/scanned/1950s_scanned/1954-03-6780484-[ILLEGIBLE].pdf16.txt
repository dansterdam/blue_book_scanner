UNCLASSIFIED
6 March 1954

I am a Civilian employee of [REDACTED] Air Force Base and want to report an incident which occurred on [REDACTED] when I was on duty at the radar station. I have been instructed not to discuss this incident with anyone other than my immediate superiors.

At approximately 8:00 p.m. on [REDACTED] I was on duty at the radar station. I noticed an object on the radar screen which was traveling at a tremendous speed and made an extremely sharp turn which is not possible for any of our aircraft. The object appeared to be oval in shape and was emitting a bright glow. It passed over the airbase and disappeared from the radar screen within a matter of seconds. I am at a loss to explain what this object could have been.

This incident has been officially reported to the Intelligence Officer and Project Blue Book. They informed me that this was not an isolated incident and that they are investigating similar reports from other radar stations. However, they cautioned me not to discuss this matter with anyone else.

This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.
