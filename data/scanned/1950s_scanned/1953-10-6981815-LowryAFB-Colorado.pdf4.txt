"This object appeared first while we were walking alone. Two other flights in the area were also making flights near the base at that time. The object was sighted by us at approximately 1930 hours, 19 October 1953, at an estimated altitude of 18,000 feet. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed, much faster than our jet aircraft. It appeared to be round or oval in shape and was very bright, a whitish color. As we watched, it made an abrupt 90 degree turn and accelerated rapidly, disappearing from our sight in a matter of seconds. It did not leave a vapor trail. Last saw object disappearing to the northeast. Toward the end of the sighting, the object appeared to be quite bright and seemed to illuminate the area underneath it. The time of the sighting was approximately 2350 hours, 19 October 1953.
