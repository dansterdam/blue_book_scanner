Where the people stars the object, 
apparently travelling at a "terrific pace" 
with no sound, 
the object according to Mrs. _, 
and another witness, who saw the 
object clearly, but too briefly to 
make detailed observation, did not 
resemble any aircraft known to them. 
They believe it was unconventional 
and not identifiable.

Mrs. _
