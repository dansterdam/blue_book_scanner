OCR output:

This snow-capped mountain, viewed from an aircraft, is actually a mirage, as described by a pilot who experienced the phenomenon. Under other type mirage conditions, land masses may appear as cigar-shaped flying objects.

Object emitting red exhaust trails. An observer flying in an aircraft may easily mistake such an apparition for a flying object. As the aircraft moves through the atmosphere at an advanced speed, the object thus may assume apparent characteristics of erratic behavior and fantastic shapes and colors.

PLANETS
Although there are other planets that may resemble flying objects under certain conditions, Venus and Mars are most commonly mistaken in this sense. Venus is the brightest, can be seen in daylight and most of the year. This planet is a morning star from January to April, and an evening star during the remainder of the year.
