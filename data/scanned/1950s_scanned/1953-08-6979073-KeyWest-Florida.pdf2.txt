SUMMARY: (Give concise summary of report. Use supplementary paragraphs. Last paragraph is a cover lett)
On 3 July and 4 August 1953, student Apprentice Charles S. Forester, a student at the U.S. Navy Pre-Flight School, Key West, Florida, observed two unidentified flying objects on 3 July at approximately 2300 EST and the second was at 2135 EST. The objects appeared to be about 50 to 100 feet in diameter and proceeded rapidly from the western horizon to the eastern horizon and disappeared. No mechanical characteristics were noted. The objects exhibited no navigation or clearance lights and no sound. The observation was made from the ground. No mechanical characteristics were noted. The objects proceeded rapidly from one horizon to the other and disappeared. The observer does not appear to be unfamiliar and his observation was apparently made in a straightforward manner. The observer does not appear to be unusually imaginative or subject to flights of fancy as far as this report is concerned.
This office has no comments upon the reports other than to note that the observer's description lacks certain details that might be expected from a more experienced or technically trained observer.
