Transcription of the text in the document:

"There is no photo. These people did not make one. They say my notes are not of good quality, but the notes were written at the time and seemed important enough to send. The object was of metallic appearance and disk-shaped. It was seen for several minutes and was generally out of the ordinary, but there is no photo. Also they apparently ground out a vehicle and let a rotor down - this may have been some sort of device to gain speed or altitude. The object did not come close enough to identify details or determine size. There are no small pieces or remains as the object apparently flew off intact. I saw it and a number of others saw it, but they were not considered competent witnesses. There may be certain objects which are far beyond our present understanding of physics and technology."
