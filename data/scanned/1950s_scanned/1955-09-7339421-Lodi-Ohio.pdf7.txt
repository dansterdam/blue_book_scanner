Statement of 

S-T-A-T-E-M-E-N-T

I looked the store at 2200 Sept 22, 1955 went home. I stopped in breezeway looking to the east and saw this bright light in the sky - It went south then turned east and went out of sight. It returned from a north east direction following same flight pattern. I watched this object follow the same pattern for 45 min. It took minimum of 15 sec. to make this pattern. Then at 2245 it went in a south east course and out of sight. I was sure that it was not a searchlight - it was some kind of air ship - it flew like a airplane and it had speed.
