The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, containing only text describing a sighting of mysterious lights by witnesses in Ipswich, Massachusetts on August 7, 9, and 10, 1956.

The lights reappeared on five occasions, and were observed by two more neighbors. Green who watched till 2:45 a.m. Sunday said that it changed shape from round to oblong. He said that it moved rapidly away to the north. Following is an interview with binoculars Green said that it appeared to be a solid, brilliantly lighted object coming up and down and jumping around, and that the results were being scrutinized by the Eastern Air Defense Command. A more complete explanation was not furnished.
