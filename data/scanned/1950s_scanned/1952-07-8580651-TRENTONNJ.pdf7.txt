The object appeared to be of a yellow color and a little larger than a basketball. It was seen for about 15 seconds. The object started to move very fast and finally disappeared. 

This object was observed by three persons - a Mrs. Lashbrook, her son Dale, and a girl friend of Dale's. Mrs. Lashbrook told me that she and the others were outside and saw the object in the sky. At first, she thought it was an airplane, but as it started to move very fast she realized it was not an airplane. All three watched the object until it disappeared.

Mrs. Lashbrook stated that to the best of her knowledge the object was hovering and then started to move very fast. It was not making any noise and disappeared suddenly. Mrs. Lashbrook stated that she would be willing to sign an affidavit about what she saw.

I would think they were traveling almost the same speed as an airplane, but without any motor noise. They did not see any trail or exhaust from the object.

This is the best I can account for it - I just thought I would send you the information in a case you might be interested in it.
