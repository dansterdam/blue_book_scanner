MATADOR, TEXAS - 31 August 1951

On 31 August 1951 at approximately 12:46 CST two ladies were driving in an automobile several miles north of Matador, Texas. The object was described as a circular-shaped object, about the size of a basketball, which suddenly appeared in the sky. The object was a definite metallic color and was moving at a speed estimated to be about 1000 miles per hour. The object was seen for about 15 seconds and no noise was heard.

As the two ladies were driving north from Matador, they suddenly noticed the object coming toward them at a high rate of speed. It appeared to be about 3 miles away. The object then stopped abruptly and began moving slowly in an eastward direction. It was observed for about 10 seconds. Seconds later the object began to ascend and in a few seconds disappeared. (Information at this point is based on the affidavit of the witnesses.)

A background investigation of the witnesses was made and their character was found to be of excellent reputation.

Weather:
a. 12:00 CST - Winds NW 5-7 miles per hour, temperature 90 degrees.
b. 12:23 CST - Winds NW 5-7 miles per hour, temperature 90 degrees.
c. 12:50 CST - Drifting SSE 3-5 miles per hour, partly cloudy, visibility 8 miles.

Status of Investigation:
It has been reported that a small animal was the object later observed, the report will be declassified due to insufficient evidence to confirm the sighting as being classified as a genuine unidentified flying object. There were also reports of "crop dusting" activity in the locality at the time, which may have contributed to the incident.
