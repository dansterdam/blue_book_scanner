AIR PRIORITY
FOREIGN SERVICE DESPATCH
FROM: AmConsul, CHIENGMAI
TO: THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON
REF: SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object Sighted Over Chiengmai
On Sunday, February 9, 1958, at approximately 6:10 p.m., various people in Chiengmai sighted a low flying object moving at high speed. Eyewitnesses, including several Chiengmai officials, were of the opinion that the object was moving from west to east at an altitude variously reported as from 600 to 800 feet. As one official put it, "You could turn your head, like the rush of a jet plane," as it passed. The object was described as being phosphorescent, oval-shaped, emitting light like a ball, about the size of a basketball, with a tail or tail section trailing it. One eyewitness reported seeing a rocket-shaped object and described the various colors of the object (viz., white, blue, green and red). Some claimed to have heard a rushing or swooshing noise as the object passed, but most said they heard nothing.
A single report was received at the Consulate by a French Catholic Priest who stated that at about 6:15 p.m. he saw the object at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. He said the object was moving with tremendous speed and appeared to him only as a streak. Intermittent puffs of green vapor or smoke were observed. His impression of a shape was that it resembled a big bird.
About mid-morning of the next day (Monday, February 10, 1958) reports were received that the town of Sankhampeng, about 25 miles southeast of Chiengmai, had an object land in the mountains east of the town and that rumors were long as a big tree. One report stated an object had been sighted in the forest.
Action Taken
Upon receipt of the above reports, the Consular Officer immediately conferred with the Political Analyst and several Chiengmai newspaper reporters. Persons claiming to have witnessed the object were interviewed and their statements are substantially the same as detailed above. The group, augmented by a police guard and several officials, attempted to locate the object, but their search was fruitless. They said they felt earth tremors as the object left the area.
