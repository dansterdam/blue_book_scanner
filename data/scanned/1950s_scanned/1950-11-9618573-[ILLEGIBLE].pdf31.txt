There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text extracted from the document:

"Because the cove he refers to is on the extreme northern tip of Oklahoma. He photocommunication here, which claims he is very familiar with Oklahoma and cove he refers to is not on a chart. He says he is sure that cove was two to three miles wide. Depth was four fathom. Citing [ILLEGIBLE] is confined on the location or the cove is much smaller than he judges.

He offered to go back and point out spot. Says map must be wrong about so house in area to mention. I doubt it, however."
