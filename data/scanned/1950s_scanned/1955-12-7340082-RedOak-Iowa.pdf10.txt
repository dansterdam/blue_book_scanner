AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO.: D-2-UFO-3-55 PAGE 4 OF 6 PAGES

I. SOURCE: Captain
Address: Kansas City, Missouri 
Age: Adult
Occupation: Captain with Braniff International Airlines
Education: College graduate. Taught physics at the University of Iowa for a period of time.

II. RELIABILITY: The investigators were able to reach the Captain himself as he was out of the state on business. However, his co-pilot, who was flying with the Captain, related the incidents to the investigators. The co-pilot had taken informed notes of the events.

III. SOURCE DESCRIPTION: While flying at about 3,000 feet two miles south of the Kansas City Municipal Airport, a large "greenish-colored" object appeared according to the Captain. The object remained in sight for about 5 minutes. The Captain quickly realized that the sighting was not some distant inbound aircraft. 

The source watched the object for about 10 seconds and told the co-pilot that it was a "nickle-sized" light, rapidly changing colors, and it seemed to be revolving. The object appeared to be slightly smaller than a basketball.

Upon landing the two flyers talked about the unusual sighting to their friends who had seen it from the ground.
