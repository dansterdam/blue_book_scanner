SUMMARY: 1. Object illustrated in flight and appeared luminous, moving at times slowly, then very rapidly and silently. Four civilian and Air Force observers watched object for approximately two hours on 12 August 1953.
2. Object illuminated in flight and appeared to have different times to four civilian and Air Force observers, California and Air Force Base, Oxnard, California.
3. Color of object was white in three dimensions and red in another. In the latter instance, the possible change in color was noticed.
4. Altitude of object was not determined. Sound, trail or exhaust not detected. Propulsion system not determined.
5. Observers considered reliable. There was no engine sound, and no vapor trail or exhaust was detected. Air Force Observers estimated that the altitude was below 10,000 feet, but it was not determined accurately.
6. No jet aircraft were in vicinity or observation area, but neither aircraft nor other objects were reported nearby.
7. Reliability that "these" objects have been lights of some kind is based on the observation that colors and shapes have changed in a manner characteristic of luminous objects in the sky, and there were no very definite sounds of place in the area. Observed for approximately two hours.
