The image does not contain any photographs, but rather a hand-drawn diagram. The diagram appears to depict a UFO sighting event, showing the trajectory of the object and the timestamps of its movement. The diagram labels two locations as "WBEM" and "WGN", and indicates that the sighting lasted for 4-5 minutes. There is also a small circle labeled "Sun" in the diagram.
