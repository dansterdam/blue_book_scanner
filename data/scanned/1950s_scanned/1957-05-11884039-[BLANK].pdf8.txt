C/S, Subj: New AFCIN-4 Plan on UFOs, Comment No. 4 (Cont)

a. SAFIS has reported that the press is completely satisfied with the periodic UFO "flap sheets" issued to them and the Air Force responses to specific UFO sightings.

The Investigation program, "UFO, Enigmas of the Skies," Circle Theater, 22 January 1958, has been beyond expectation. On 22 March a bulletin certifying the program were received by the Air Force. All were from so-called "cranks". Mr. Donald Keyhoe, President of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), aligned himself with the press by going beyond the T.V. script in an attempt to criticize the Air Force.

d. Several meetings between representatives of SAFRD, SAFIS, SAFLC, and SAFMO concerning public information as air force response to a request by the Senate's Government Operations Sub-Committee on Investigations to conduct open hearings on the Air Force conduct of its UFO program under AFCIN. The Sub-Committee requested the public be informed through the Congress-man who maintained that the public approach was favorably looked upon by all but the AFCIN member who manifested that the unstructured publicity could result in more difficulties than could be considered.

5. It is recommended that the foregoing be used as a basis for briefing of General Lewis.
