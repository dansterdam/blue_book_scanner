Text from the document:

IGY EVIDENCE...
(Continuing from pages 6)
POSITIVE POINTS:
1. The report of the CC Bacellor, who saw in the film immediately after it was developed, said that the picture appears to be a moving object identified as a saucer, and also that the pictures preceding the sequence were taken aboard a few minutes before the incident...
2. Concerning the negatives, they were submitted to examination by the Hydrography and Navigation Department from the Crueiro do Sul Aerophotogrammetric Service, with the following results:
a) The technician from the Navy's HPD, after examination of the negatives, affirms that they are natural;
b) The technician from the Crueiro do Sul Aerophotographic Service, after microscopic examinations to verify the granulation, analysis of signals, verification of impurities and details of outlines, affirmed that there was not any sign of photomontage in the negatives so all the evidence indicating they are in fact negatives of an object really photographed;
c) The hypothesis of a photomontage can definitely be excluded. 
d) It is impossible to prove either the existence or the nonexistence of a previous photomontage, which requires however a high-precision technic and favourable circumstances to its execution.
CONCLUSIONS:
Considering the presentation of the facts and the summary analysis made, it can be concluded:
a) That there are a number of witnesses who stated they have sighted UAOs over the Trindade Island. Such witnesses have different qualifications and their statements were made in different days;
b) That most reports presented are insufficient, mostly due to the lack of technical skill of many observers and to the brief duration of the phenomena observed, so that no conclusion can be reached concerning positive data about the UAOs;
