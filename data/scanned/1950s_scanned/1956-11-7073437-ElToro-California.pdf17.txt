STATEMENT

Upon arriving at work at 2330, the evening watch informed us that there had been a "flying saucer" sighting earlier that night. There was a little discussion as to what they looked like etc. and I informed the individuals concerned that I had had some experience with investigations of this type (about 1220) GCA and the helicopter were working together on 26.8. The choppers used a searchlight to illuminate the field and GCA worked all night running intercepts on the blips. There were about 0630 all blips disappeared and the search was discontinued. Although I exposed the sky with the aid of the searchlight, search with GCA and the helicopter, I was unable to see any of these unknown objects.
