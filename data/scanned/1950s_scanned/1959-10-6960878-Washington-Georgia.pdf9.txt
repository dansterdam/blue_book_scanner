DESCRIPTION: Material Residue Allegedly Seen Falling From Air In Vicinity of Sparta, Georgia
PURPOSE: To identify microresidues that may be found on ground and equipment surfaces in cited area.

FACTUAL DATA:
As a result of an investigation, the following has been claimed to have been seen in the air by people at a home between Sparta, Georgia, and Crawfordville, Georgia, shortly after noon on 12 Oct 59. Alleged sightings will result in ground observations.

Samples were taken from various locations in the area in which the material was supposed to have fallen, and these as follows:

Sample #1 - dust from a table top located outside the house. This table top was only partially exposed during the time of the sightings.

Sample #2 - small pieces of weathered insulation taken from exterior electrical wiring between the house and an area covered very heavily with the vegetation during the time and shortly after the sightings, but that had gradually disappeared.

Sample #3 - a small amount of material taken from the bottom of an elevated iron wash tub. This water supposedly had been there during the sightings.

Sample #4 - when the Georgia Highway Patrol, located in Sparta, Georgia, inspected the area shortly after the sightings, they found several areas discolored on the ground. The material was described as a "gray-white powder" (see attached statement).

Sample #5 - taken from the top surface of the discolored area. This sample included soil, grass, rocks, and tree leaves.
