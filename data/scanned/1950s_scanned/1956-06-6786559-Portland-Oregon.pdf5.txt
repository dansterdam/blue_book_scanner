DATA: ON 23 JUNE, 1956 ABOUT 10:00 P.M. PACIFIC ST. TIME OBSERVER REPORTS THE FOLLOWING:
"I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK AND SAW TWO STRANGE LIGHTS IN THE SKY WHICH APPEARED TO BE APPROX. 4 MILES WEST OF PORTLAND. THEY SEEMED TO BE CIRCLING EACH OTHER AND THEN MOVED RAPIDLY EASTWARD AND DISAPPEARED. THEY WERE QUITE BRIGHT AND DID NOT BLINK OR FLASH AS AN AIRCRAFT WOULD. I DECIDED TO REPORT THIS SIGHTING TO SEE IF OTHERS HAD SEEN THE SAME THING."
