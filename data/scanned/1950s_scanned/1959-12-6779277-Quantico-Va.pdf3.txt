Transcription of the text in the document:

"The verdict: The witness had looked to the left towards the horizon, but it was merely instinctive reaction; she did not see anything unusual at that time. Today, the sighting was investigated and appeared to be a reflection from the water on the shore of Lake Erie.

As the witness talked on the sighting, the investigator was not convinced that the witness had seen anything unusual, but felt that the sighting had been exaggerated somewhat in the telling.

It was reported that the witness, Mrs. J.P. Poperkowitz, had a tendency to exaggerate stories, and the investigator felt that this sighting was another example of this tendency.

The next thing noticed, according to the witness, was a flash of light which appeared to be low on the horizon, apparently very bright, and which seemed to pass across the sky. The witness stated that this flash of light seemed to come from her left to her right and that it seemed to go very quickly, and only lasted an instant or so.

At the same time, the witness stated that she saw something dark pass in front of the light. She could not tell what this object was, but felt that it seemed to pass in front of the light flash about the same time the light flash occurred.

According to the witness, the next thing noticed was a small, glowing object that appeared to be hovering or "setting" on the water. The witness stated that this object seemed to be about 1000 yards away from her position and that she could see it clearly, as the area was well illuminated by the street lights.

The witness described the object as being round and glowing, and stated that she could not tell whether or not it had any other features, as the glow was the most noticeable characteristic. The witness stated that this object remained in the same position on the water for about 5 minutes, and then suddenly disappeared.

The witness, Mrs. J.P. Poperkowitz, and Mr. J.P. Poperkowitz, the witness' husband, were interviewed at their home at 8:30 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. respectively on the same date as the sighting. The investigators felt that the witness was telling the truth as she saw it, but that she tended to exaggerate stories and that the sighting was not as unusual as she described it.

It is the opinion of the investigators that this sighting was merely a reflection from the water on the shore of Lake Erie, and that the witness, in the excitement of the moment, exaggerated what she saw."
