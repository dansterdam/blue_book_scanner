SECRET SECURITY INFORMATION

A preliminary analysis of the existing report file has been completed. Information derived from this analysis has been applied in improving the present interrogation form. A Tentative Observer's Data Sheet has been prepared and studied by the consultants' panel. Pertinent suggestions were incorporated in the tentative form, which is enclosed for review in Section I. The revised data sheet now includes all technical details thought to be essential. It is to be evaluated next by an astronomer, a psychologist, and a CAA investigator. Arrangements for their evaluations are now being made. 

The facts reported in present files or on new sightings are to be entered on the observer's data sheet. This information will not be coded for direct entry on punched cards. Instead, the facts will be classified and analyzed before entries are made on the punched cards. To facilitate this process, a coding scheme has been prepared to serve as an intermediate step between the data sheet and the punched card.

A copy is enclosed in Section I.

The final element in the data record is the punched card on which the results of coded calculations and analyses are entered. A copy of a typical card is also enclosed in Section I.

Newspaper accounts of sightings furnished by the clipping service are being received at approximately a constant rate; however, the Life article is now responsible for only about half of the clippings. Originally, the clippings were copied at Battelle, and then transmitted to the Sponsor. In the future, the clippings will be sent directly to the Sponsor by Battelle.
