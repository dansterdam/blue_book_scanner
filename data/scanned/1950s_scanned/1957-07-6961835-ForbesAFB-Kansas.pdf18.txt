The image contains an electrical schematic diagram with various components labeled, including an ALA-6 detection finder, an ASA-656 antenna assembly, and other related parts and connections. There is no photograph present in this image.

McClure decided that there must be a malfunction in his ALA-6, but he did not report it to the aircraft commander at the time. (It was not until later, following the installation of the electronic counter-measure devices on the RB-47 at greater than the RB-47's 500 mph speed.)

Analysis of circuite diagram from the ALA-6 instruction books suggests several possible malfunctions that could cause an anomalous up-down movement, one of which is considered more probable, i.e. the ALA-6 antenna is moved from the optimum signal when the signal is horizontally polarized, while the other is used when the signal is vertically polarized.

The ALA-6 operator selects the proper antenna dish by means of a toggle switch on the ALA-6 control panel. If the incorrect one is selected, the signals received will not be properly processed and the optimum signal may not be obtained.

When selecting the appropriate antenna dish, care must be exercised to insure that the relay KPOL will be operated to obtain correct polarization to the APR-9 receiver. The spring-loaded relay then connects the horizontally polarized dish to the APR-9.
