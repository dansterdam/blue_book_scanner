Similar star like objects appeared throughout a five second period at interval of three to four seconds duration. The objects varied from north to south direction from horizon to horizon and then disappeared on the southern horizon. No sound was detected. The object could not be sighted with binoculars due to the great speed of travel and very short duration of visibility.

The GOC observation platform is located so as to permit unobstructed vision to the north, east and south. Vision to the west is obstructed by a wall.
The first object was sighted in the north. The weather was clear and dry with a slight breeze blowing. The temperature was in the low seventies (70's).
The sighting was reported to Mr. XXXX, GOC Supervisor, and GOC Director.
