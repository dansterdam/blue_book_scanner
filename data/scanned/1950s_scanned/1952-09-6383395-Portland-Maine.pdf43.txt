Question and Answer Sheet. (Confd)

8. (Q) What was the altitude of the P2V as compared to the
      altitude of the unidentified objects?

     (A) The altitude of the P2V was 4000 feet plus or minus
400 feet. The altitude of the P2V was varied within these
limits in the attempt to see the objects better against
the remaining light of the sun. As far as could be de-
termined the unidentified objects were at 4000 feet and
did not deviate from that altitude.

9. (Q) What was the cloud cover in the area at the time of the
     sighting?

    (A) According to the pilot and co-pilot of the P2V it was a
clear nite with no moon and with a few clouds on the hori-
zon. This is borne out by weather report and the under-
signed personal observation.
