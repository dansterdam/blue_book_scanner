Here is the text from the document:

On 19 December 1952 about 2030 hours while carrying out a routine call, I saw a round object, approximately 3'4" in diameter, hovering some 12' to 15' above the ground. At first I thought it was a light, but as I watched, the object moved laterally some 40' to 50' behind a bush and then returned to its original position. This occurred several times. The object appeared to be metallic in color and was emitting a glow. After observing the object for about 5 minutes, I turned to look at the Sergeant who was with me, and when I looked back, the object had disappeared. I only saw the object for about 1 second, but I don't think it was a star or a planet. It was definitely something unusual that is hard to explain. I have observed many strange things in the sky, and this was one of the most puzzling. It was certainly not an aircraft or anything I'm familiar with.
