IT WAS ABOUT 12:30 O'CLOCK LEVIT AND I WERE SITTING OUT ON THE PORCH
STAR, HOWEVER, AFTER A CLOSER LOOK I FELT IT WAS NOT A STAR BUT IT MOVED A LITTLE I THEN CALLED LEVIT'S ATTENTION TO IT ANDWE BOTH WATCHED IT - IT WAS VERY BRIGHT AND MOVING IN AN ERRATIC PATH - IT LITERALLY TOOK TO A HEADING OF 240 DEGREES AND GOT OUT OF SIGHT IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS - WE WERE COMPLETELY BAFFLED AS WE KNOW OF NO AIRCRAFT KNOWN TO US THAT CAN MOVE AND DISAPPEAR AT SUCH SPEED. WE STOOD THERE FOR SOME TIME WONDERING WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN.

THE COMMENTS ON THE REPORT BLANK STATES THAT VISUAL SIGHTING WERE MADE IN MIDDIEBHRE WITH THE TIME.

NOTE: I SAY LEVIT BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO BE ON THE HORIZON OF A GREAT DISTANCE, WHICH MIGHT BE TAKEN AS A MEASURE OF SPEED. THE OBJECT SEEMED SO FAR AWAY AND YET MOVED SO FAST IT WAS ASTOUNDING."
