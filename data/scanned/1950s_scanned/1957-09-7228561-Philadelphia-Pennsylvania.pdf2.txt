Nutley, Now Jersey

Dear Mr. I

Your letter of 10 September to Mr. Edgar Soyert, Federal Bureau of Investigation, regarding some sighting of an object from the sky, has been referred to the Air Force for review.

We agree that the matter appears to deserve investigation. The object you described as seeming to be under intelligent control by remote directions, and referred to as a "fighter", is of interest.

Nutley is located adjacent to some of the heaviest air traffic and is only 8 miles from Philadelphia. This may be confirmed by inspection of aero charts nr. 310, which can be obtained for the sum of 30 cents from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington 25, D.C.

With regard to the discoveries, opinions and allegations advanced by you, we have established a rule not to become involved in, or comment on, speculative discussions.

Your interest in this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,
