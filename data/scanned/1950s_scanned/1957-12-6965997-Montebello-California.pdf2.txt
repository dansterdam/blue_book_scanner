REPORT OF INTERVIEW WITH WITNESS

On 21 January 1953 I—— and I—— called at my home to pick up the film which they had loaned this office. We had finished duplications of the film at a local color film lab and the original film was returned to them on that date.

I examined his camera, an RB Graflex camera 5x7.

The film used was Kodachrome Indoor Type A, color outdoors with a skylight filter. The distance setting was on infinity and that at 15 frames per second.

Q. What is your estimate of the altitude of the objects which you photographed?

A. About the same height as the light airplanes which I frequently see over the house, between 6000 and 9000 feet.

Q. Were they at any time as high as jet aircraft?

A. No, definitely not.

Q. Did you see any smoke trail or any kind of trail from the objects?

A. No, there was no visible trail of any sort.
