The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. There is no photograph present on this page.

The text in the document is as follows:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. 350 feet.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand (Circle One): a. Head of a pin b. Pen c. Dime d. Nickel e. Quarter f. Half dollar g. Silver dollar h. Basketball i. Grapefruit j. Baseball k. Other

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22): a. Certain b. Pretty certain c. Not very sure d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Gradually disappeared - went into distance - could not be seen - was either forgotten or flown away.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you say it was made, and what shape would it be, and what sizes? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

A SAUCERAN QUERY. I HAVEN'T THE IMMAGINATION FOR THIS. GOD KNOWS I'M NOT MUCH GOOD AT CREATING "SCIENCE FICTION" TYPES (A GUESS). I DO HOPE IN ALL SINCERITY THE USAF TAKES THESE MATTERS SERIOUSLY. I WOULD, HOWEVER, MAKE A GUESS THAT POSSIBLY THIS OBJECT WAS OF METALLIC CONSTRUCTION.
