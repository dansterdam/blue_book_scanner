The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old document, likely related to Project Blue Book, that discusses various aspects of UFO sightings and related phenomena.

Text from the document:

Firing is conducted out to see and over controlled test ranges. Since all unauthorized persons are chased out of the area, there would be no one likely to turn in a UAO report.

After eliminating UAO sightings attributable to the astronomical and the non-astronomical phenomena considered in this article, together with the hoaxes, discussed on page _______, plus those reports lacking sufficient evidence for investigation -- after all this, approximately 15% of UAO sightings remain bona fide UAOs. That is, the evidence suggests no ready explanation.

Trick of temperature - Inversion and refraction:
One possible explanation has been advanced by the Harvard astrophysicist, Dr. Donald H. Menzel. (See Look, June 17, 1952, pp. 35-39.) As summarized by TIME, June 9, 1952, pp. 54-56, the kernel of Dr. Menzel's hypothesis follows:
"Generally, the atmosphere grows cooler as altitude increases, but under some conditions it may contain layers of warm air with cold air below them. These are called 'inversions.' They occur in all climates but are commonest in deserts, where both the ground and the air get very hot in daytime. As soon as the sun sets, the ground cools off, radiating its warmth into the sky. The air for a few feet up grows cool by contact with the cool earth, but above this layer the air is a little hotter."
