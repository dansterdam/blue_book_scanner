The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line and a person's silhouette, with text explaining that the curved line represents the horizon and the position of the object above the horizon. The second sketch shows a landscape view, with a small sketch insert illustrating how to complete the larger sketch.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
