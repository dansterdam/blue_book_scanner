Analyst's Comments:
1. Claims (the saucer case was about 4:25 like the other Cans), George F. Quinn, indicates that the report is about a UFO sighting witnessed by a Mr. Pighetti, a lightbeam was observed in the Dry Tortugas.
2. It has been some time since this report now, that the sighting would need to be investigated soon, otherwise information may be lost or difficult to recover.
3. However, as a matter of courtesy, please ensure that the investigator in charge of this case is notified and that the required steps of investigation are carried out.
4. Request for information - is any investigation to be done, and if so, when is the intent investigation to begin?
