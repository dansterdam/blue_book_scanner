FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
JUNE 25, 1952

This report is submitted in accordance with instructions contained in letter dated April 28, 1952, from Colonel F. R. Skeen, Chief, Intelligence Division, USAF. The object was reported to have appeared over Labrador on June 8, 1952. The object was described as a silvery, disc-shaped object, approximately 25 feet in diameter, which hovered over a remote area of Labrador for approximately 10 minutes. The object then accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and disappeared from sight. The ground observer, a U.S. Air Force enlisted man, was in a position to observe the object clearly. 

I do not believe it was any known type of aircraft. The performance characteristics of the object, as described, are beyond the capabilities of any known type of aircraft. The object exhibited a high degree of maneuverability and speed which cannot be duplicated by any aircraft under development at the present time.
