25 January, 1957

SUBJECT: Statement made by 4/30 

Well around 2230 hrs, 24 January, 1957, we went down Charleston Blvd to Warlis Plaza and on some ground we found on soutnain about 1/2 mile after the second turn-off we turned around and parked at the right side of the road. We could see some lights rising and slowing down and eventually at the size of the planet about two miles away. One of the lights might have just to the right of the car, about two miles away. The other light seemed to be suspended, stationary, and then started to get brighter and move slowly upwards, disappearing into the distance. It was all later than previous sightings we have had in this area. The slow movement and changes in size and clarity is noticed. This was about 15-20 minutes that we saw these objects. There were no sound that we could hear from them.

This is all the text that appears on the page.
