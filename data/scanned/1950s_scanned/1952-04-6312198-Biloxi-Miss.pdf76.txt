The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document, likely related to Project Blue Book, a US Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The image does not contain a photograph, but rather what seems to be a technical diagram or graph with various lines and measurements.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can output the following text found in the document:

3 km. 3 km. 3 km. 3 km. 3 km.
