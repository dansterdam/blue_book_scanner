Memo to ACS/I, Attn: GHI-R SUBI: R & G UFO R, A, T 12 Mar 53

1. As you know, on very dark nights, it is possible to observe aircraft mostly from their jet or afterburner flames, with no sound. This also holds true with aircraft condensation trails during the day.

2. On the basis of the data given, there is no reason to believe that the "unknown light" observed was other than a high-altitude jet aircraft, with the observer at such a distance as to be unable to identify it as such, and, of course, that all friendly aircraft flights were accounted for.
