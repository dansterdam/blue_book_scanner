PAGE 2 of 2 PAGES

On 10 September, Major ——— and 1st. Lt. ——— of the 119th Fighter Interceptor Squadron of the Air Defense Command, Rudd Army Air Force Base, New Jersey, these pilots were scrambled to intercept an unidentified object over the Monmouth County area.

They acquired the object in a diving turn to the west, descending to an altitude of about 16,000 feet. They closed the object to about 600 feet behind and to the right of the object. Thereafter, he tried to keep a course paralleling, but above, that of the object.

As soon as Major —— watched completed his radio check, he was notified of the streamer of the object and began firing. The object made a turn together while it climbed at a speed estimated to be about 50-60 miles before it disappeared.

The object was in control of the T-33 jet for about two minutes, and the object covering a distance of less than a minute. As to the weather and description of the object are unknown.

In the same date a radar station at Ft. Monmouth reported two targets that were unidentified, traveling very high, and giving returns that could not be explained as being equipment malfunction, erroneous propagation, or anything but actual aircraft. The pilots could not give any more information on these radar observations because of the restricted communication during the incident.
