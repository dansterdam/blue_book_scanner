Opheim, Montana
4 December 1952
SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Objects

TO: Chief, Air Technical Intelligence Center
ATTN: AFOIN-4A, Headquarters Air Force Base, Ohio
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

1. In reference to your letter of 13 November 1952, file ATIN-3, subject as above, AF Form 112 is not available at this station. ATIN-3 records to contain same form our support base have met with only partial success, in that only a part of the form is available. Therefore the information requested is set forth in the following paragraphs:

2. The objects were sighted by Mr. Glasgow, Montana, who is an observer with the U.S. Weather Bureau office there. This observation was made on 13 November 1952 at 0243 hours (MST) while he was taking scheduled wind-aloft observations. He first noticed a faint blue-white light in the southwest. This light was the only northwestward movement observed. He then noticed four or five objects trailing each other in a "V" formation. They seemed to be about 30 to 50 feet in diameter, and traveling in a level flight. No noise whatever. He estimated their speed as "that of jet" and the altitude as between two and three thousand feet. The objects appeared to change course or maneuver slightly, and continued in a southwest direction. The two outside objects seemed to bank and move out of formation a little. Estimated distance from observer to objects at the closest point was one mile.

3. There was a thin overcast at the time, and while Mr. Glasgow said it could possibly be light reflecting off the clouds, he would swear that it was something different.

4. Inquiry was made around Glasgow as to the integrity of Mr. Glasgow, and as a result it is believed that he would not be the type to just "dream up" a story of this nature.
