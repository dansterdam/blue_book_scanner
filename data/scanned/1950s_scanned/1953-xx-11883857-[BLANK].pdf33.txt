FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATIONS

GENERAL

An UFOB report is worthy of follow-up investigation when it con-

clarity of the data, that there is something of identification value and/or

In general, reports which should be given consideration are those
which involve several reliable observers, together or separately, and which
concern sightings of greater duration than one quarter minute. Exception
should be made to this when circumstances attending the reports are con-
sidered to be extraordinary.

Special attention should be given to reports which give promise of a
"fix" on the position and to those reports involving unusual trajectories.

RULES OF THUMB

Every UFOB case should be judged individually but there are a number
of "rules of thumb," under each of the following headings, which should
prove helpful in determining the necessity for follow-up investigation.

1. Duration of Sighting
When the duration of a sighting is less than 15 seconds, the
probabilities are great that it is not worthy of follow-up. As a word
of caution, however, should a large number of individual observers concur
