POST SCRIPT TO THE CAPTURED UFO REPORT.
Less finally, mentioned on page 5 is now being pointed out as more strange thing fallen from the sky in Los Barios, Brazil, reported on paper No.31 (headquarters file No. 9). A strange metal "some-thing" which appeared to be nearly coneless, of a peculiar design, struck the ground near Los Banos. It was pried up and secured by the local militarla forces. A closer examination is promised to determine, if possible, whether it does not represent a Geiger-Miller counter with some of the natural radioactivity, or might be a 'thing' of some other manufactured origin. Thus far the metallurgical and chemical analysis shows it to be a fragment of metal, but not of any regular manufacture. The details are yet to be studied.
U.S. CAPTURED UFO MATERIAL ANALYSIS.
The Institute in Sao Paulo has completed the analysis of the object captured in Lima, that is now known as the "shining things". 
1.) The analysis was made by the chemist Paul Philip, who wrote the following: 
"The sample presents a cluster of 'black' filaments. Submitted to calculation the analysis revealed 40% carbon and a mineral residue of the same sort, essentially constituted by 65% silicon - an amount much above the mineral found in the meteorites. The silicon was not destroyed. These analysis and some complementary others allow us to conclude that the filaments consist of some carbonic matter originated by incomplete combustion of an organic substance.
2.) It is therefore found that the 'filaments' that originate it (are submitted to in-complete combustion. Therefore nothing can be said about what was it"
In just this text we can see that there are no photographs or visual elements, only a detailed text analysis of some captured UFO material.
