There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a form with questions related to the motion and size of a UFO or unidentified object.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand?
(Circle One): A. Head of a pin B. Silver dollar C. Baseball D. Orange E. Nickel F. Grapefruit G. Doorknob H. Basketball I. Other

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22): 
A. Certain B. Fairly certain C. Not very sure D. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would it be made, of what shape and size, and what other characteristics would it have which would be similar to the same appearance as the object which you saw?
