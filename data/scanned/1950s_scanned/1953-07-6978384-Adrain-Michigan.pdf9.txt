The image does not contain a photograph, but rather two sketches. 

The first sketch shows a curved line with the letter "A" marked on it. This sketch is intended to illustrate how high the observed object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it.

The second sketch shows a larger landscape scene with a person standing on a road. It also includes a smaller inset sketch showing a more distant landscape with a curved sky.
