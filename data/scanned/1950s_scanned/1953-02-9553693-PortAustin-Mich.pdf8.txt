SUBJECT: (Anal) Radar Sighting of Unknown Aerial Object

Commanding Officer
742nd Aircraft and Warning Squadron
Fort's Handing Michigan

1. Your AC&W Squadron made electronic contact with unidentified aerial object on 17 February 1953 at 2200 hours EST and notified the Air Defense Command via circumstantial intelligence center by wire of this circumstance.

2. ATIC review specialists have found the subject questionnaires as now completed to contain the known radar tracks taken of this object of observation. These are stated but accurately by the radar personnel involved.

3. Since the sighting at your site seems more significant than usual to necessitate this follow-up, and since the object's characteristics were ATID interest, I am requested to advise that you:

a. Forward the Radar Track Data Sheet at your earliest convenience.
b. Be prepared to provide any supplementary information, on request, which may be deemed appropriate.
