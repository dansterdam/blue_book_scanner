The image appears to contain a photograph of an unidentified object in the sky. The object seems to be a circular shape with some markings or details within it. The text below the image reads "OUT OF FOCUS", indicating that the photograph may not have captured the object clearly. At the bottom of the image, the text "PRINT 15" is written, suggesting this is the 15th print of the image.

As an OCR system, I will now output the text found in the document:
