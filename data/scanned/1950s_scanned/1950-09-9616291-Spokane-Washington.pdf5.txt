Both Mrs. Gardinier and a neighbor, Mrs. Lowell Allen, observed the third object as it climbed and disappeared toward FAF. Major Gardinier described the object as "bright as another star." It appeared to be pulsing and descended, 2 to 3 times in depth, when first sighted. Still the monotonous appearance was initially terrifying. Conversation was difficult in the air. They were capable of abrupt changes of direction and speed. No sounds were heard. The weather was CAVU. Neither Mrs. Gardinier nor the neighbor could identify the object. No trail, smoke, or flame could be seen. They appeared to rise and then followed the course of the speaker viewer until for approximately five minutes and then proceeding almost directly toward FAF. All three objects appeared to have a high rate of speed, difficult to estimate because of lack of reference as to size and distance. No further observations were reported.
