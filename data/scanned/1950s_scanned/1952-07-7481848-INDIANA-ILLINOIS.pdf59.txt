1. Mr. has requested an evaluation of his sighting 
of 11 July 1952. Initial screening of the files failed to reveal 
any observational reports from British Columbia for that date.

2. Mr. has returned a completed FTD Form 164. Information 
contained therein indicates the closest passed aircraft at least 600 
feet seconds with a description characteristic of a meteor. His 
case is now on file for further study, with that evaluation (number).
