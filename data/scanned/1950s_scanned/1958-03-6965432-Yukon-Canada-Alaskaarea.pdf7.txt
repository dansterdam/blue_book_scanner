Ref your report of unusual meteor-like object observed by numerous A/C and ground observers between Yakutat, Alaska, and Whitehorse between 2312Z and 2330Z on 30 Mar 58. Taking into consideration the known tendency and inability of many observers to give precise azimuths, elevations, directions and other angular measurements, particularly if startled or due to suddenness of phenomena, the following are considered: (a) Objects were seen precisely at 2322Z simultaneously at 2 or 3 sites. (b) All observers located within a 250 mile area.
