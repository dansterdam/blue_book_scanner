A REPORT ON THE SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT

Location: 9 miles west of benson, Arizona
Date: 18 October 1957
Time: 1927-1939 MST
Observers: [redacted]

Observations:
On the evening of 18 October, our group was attempting to sight the Russian earth satellite, Sputnik I, or the third-stage rocket which accompanied the satellite in orbit. The satellite was scheduled to appear at 1939, and on that day some rockets were reported to be landing the satellite by remote-control minutes. Thus, we expected that the rocket, if seen at all, would appear about 1939. A camera was set up to record what we saw.
The object was not seen at 1939, but was continued to watch the sky, and around 1927 a bright object appeared over the southeast horizon and traveled rapidly across the sky, disappearing over the north-northwest horizon at about 1932. The object was brighter than any star in the sky, but less bright than the planet Venus was on that night. The first exhibited a yellowish hue, and it was our opinion that it was reflected sunlight.
