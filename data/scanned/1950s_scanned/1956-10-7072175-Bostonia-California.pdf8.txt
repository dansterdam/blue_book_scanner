Dear Miss

We are in receipt of a series of photographs to the Air Force 
by the Federal Bureau of Investigations, showing what is purported 
to be an unidentified flying object. A detailed analysis, which 
included both microscopic examinations and large-size projections, 
indicates the following:

    a. The camera was moved sometime between the period the
shutter was opened and closed. This is borne out by a study of the 
moon track, which would normally be a straight, unbroken-line image. 
The track in the photographs is broken both in direction and time.
    
    b. The "missing period" can be determined by taking the 
moon's approximate diameter of 1/2 degrees, and its known time-movement 
across the sky. A plot indicates that there was a lapse of time be- 
tween exposures of 2 to 3 minutes. This would be sufficient time for 
the removal of the camera from its fixed position, after which a second 
superimposed image made, and the camera returned to its original 
position. As indicated by the broken track of the moon, the attempt 
to set the camera in its exact previous position was difficult to do.
    
    c. Your attention is invited to the line slightly above
the object. This appears to be part of a room ceiling, and is par- 
ticularly suggestive of this assumption if the line is extended outward 
to form a corner. The object, in our opinion, is a conventional light 
fixture.
