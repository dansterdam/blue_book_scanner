AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Det 1, 6004th AISS, APO 970 52-276 PAGE 2 OF 4 PAGES

On 16 and 17 October 1952, lst Lt. William H. Hooper and 1st Lt. Donald I. O'Neil, Instructor Pilot and Instructor Navigator of the 6127th Training Group at K-47 were on a routine training mission in an F-84 type aircraft.

On the morning of 16 October 1952, Lt. Hooper, instructor Pilot and Lt. O'Neil, Instructor Navigator, were flying a routine training mission. At 0955L, Lt. Hooper was flying - the aircraft at approximately 34,000 feet altitude. As he was checking the ball for activity, he observed the object suddenly appear heading west approximately 8-10 miles west of his position. The object was traveling on a magnetic heading of 100 degrees.

Lt. Hooper drew the attention of Lt. O'Neil who did not observe it until the aircraft and the object were parallel. As soon as Lt. O'Neil observed it, the object appeared to be decelerating. Lt. Hooper continued to observe the object as it appeared to be maneuvering. The object appeared to be an extremely bright white light similar to an arc welding light, approximately 15,000 meters from the aircraft's position, traveling on a magnetic heading of 280 degrees.

Lt. Hooper estimates the time of the hovering operation to be approximately 1 second. Lt. O'Neil estimated the time to be about 1 or 2 seconds while it appeared.

Lt. Hooper observed the right wing of the aircraft for a better observation of the object. The object suddenly disappeared from sight in the same manner as its initial appearance and disappeared from sight in the same manner as its initial appearance, approximately 15,000 meters away.

The physical description of the object is as follows: It appeared to be a jet or similar type aircraft, but upon further observation it did not appear to have any structural or aerodynamical characteristics consistent in the present-day aircraft. The object appeared circular in shape and metallic in color with no protrusions of any kind. No exhaust or other propulsive evidence was observed. The estimated size of the object was 20 feet in diameter, by comparison with the 37 foot wing span of the F-84 aircraft. The object appeared to be under observation for approximately three minutes from 0955L.

The object was seen against three back ground, clftnwly at the first sighting.
