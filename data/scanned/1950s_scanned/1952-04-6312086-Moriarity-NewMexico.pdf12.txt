APPENDIX V
Moriarity, New Mexico - 13 April 1952

I. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT
On 13 April 1952 at 16:45 MST, four airmen observed a silver, disc-shaped object east of Moriarity, New Mexico. The object appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed and the airmen were unable to ascertain its altitude. The object was observed for several minutes and they all agreed that its speed and manueverability eliminated that possibility.
The time of observation was judged to be from four to ten minutes.

II. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
Both Moriarity, New Mexico, and Albuquerque have radar but no unusual returns were noted on 13 April.
A piball balloon was released from Albuquerque at 1400 MST. The winds, however, were about 4 knots out of the northeast in the Moriarity area, and the balloon soared easterly, away from Moriarity. It is possible the balloon looked and leveled off at a low altitude, however, it would have been south of the observation point. The speed and maneuvers do not correlate with a normal balloon's drift except for the possibility that there might have been some strong winds at the time. This cannot be ascertained and the object must remain unidentified.

III. CONCLUSIONS
None.
