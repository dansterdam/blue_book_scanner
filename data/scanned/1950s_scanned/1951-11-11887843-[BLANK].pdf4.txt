The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects.

It was learned from Major LOTY, that Col. Barnes, O. C. at HAFB, no longer felt there was any justification for the allocation of funds for maintaining systematic investigation. Rather, he provided that the project be maintained on a standby basis and without official Air Force status. This entails assignment of an officer (Major LOTY) to collect incoming reports, maintain liaison with OSI, Provost Marshall's Office and any other agencies whose activities may serve to provide information concerning future aerial phenomena developments. Land-Air has agreed to report and if possible photograph any abnormal sightings made during their scheduled periods of operation (about eight hours). The weather station will function similarly. Also, all pilots have been briefed to report any unusual observations. If necessary, the project can be activated very quickly, even to the extent where funds will be made available for the purchase of equipment.

Major LOTY also arranged a conference with Mr. Warren Kott, who is in charge of Land-Air operations. Mr. Kott pointed out that a formal report covering the year's vigilance period had not been issued since the contract contained no such provision. Actually, a time correlation study should be made covering the film and visual recordings at both Ascension stations. This would assure that these records did not contain significant material. However, such a study is quite laborious, and would require about thirty man-days to complete. Again, no provisions are contained in the contract for this study, but Mr. Kott felt that DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS DOD DIR 5200.10
