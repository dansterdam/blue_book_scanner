WASHBURN OBSERVATORY

MADISON 6, WISCONSIN

June 6, 1953

Dear Miss Cluck:

We have no eye-witness reports of the phenomenon observed in southwestern Wisconsin on the morning of the 31st of May, 1953. It would seem to be a duplication of effort for us to attempt an investigation of this sort, since the fighter squadron based at Truax Field, Madison, does not wish us to handle any cases of this type.

Captain John K. Fox informs me that he has made a report through Air Force channels of his investigation. He believes that it was moonlight on some scattered low-lying clouds against a background of high overcast. This does not constitute a report about which I see about attention is needed.

Very truly yours,

A.E. Whitford
Director
