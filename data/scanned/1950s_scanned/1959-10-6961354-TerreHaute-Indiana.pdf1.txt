10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: This case was investigated by Major Harold E. Taplin, USAF and presented at a conference at Wright-Patterson AFB. He investigated a possible UFO sighting by a civilian radar operator who tracked several unidentified targets at 5:10 PM on 9/29/59. The targets were observed on his radar at about 25,000 feet, traveling at high speed, estimated to be around 2,000 knots. The targets were observed on radar for about 4 minutes, then went off the screen. No visual sightings were made. The witness was a competent and experienced radar operator.
11. COMMENTS: This incident is listed in the USAF's SAFOI-34 (Project BLUE BOOK) file as a case of "possible equipment malfunction". The radar operator's observations indicated high-speed, maneuverable targets which could not be identified as known aircraft, satellites, etc. His competence and experience as a radar operator lend significance to this report. However, no visual sightings were made, so the possibility of equipment malfunction cannot be ruled out.
