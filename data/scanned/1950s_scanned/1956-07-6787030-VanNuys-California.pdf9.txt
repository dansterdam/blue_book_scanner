The text reads as follows:

"He took a short flight into space at high speeds.
Part Three: Background information. Col Mitchell made telephone contact with (redacted) merely to effect an informal interview and obtain some impression or source. He was found to be extremely uncooperative and hostile. Press reporters and TV be present. Obviously a planned publicity stunt. Consequently, Col Mitchell called ATIC explaining situation. Was advised not to pursue matter further. However, opinion of this Center is that (redacted) will undoubtedly give story to newspapers that Air Force is a nuisance and contacted him on sighting. Recommend Col Mitchell or unit be contacted by your nearest ATIS unit for disposition of witnesses if possible and that they be submitted to ATIC as soon as possible in order that they be passed on to AFOIS and OCAE PIO as material to counter any adverse publicity that may arise regarding this matter.
