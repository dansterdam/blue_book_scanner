AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
DOC NO. 6004th AISS 52-269

STATEMENT OF T/SGT L. D. YOUNG, USHER:

On 1 October, approximately 2200 hours we had been on heading of approximately 030 at 8000 feet. As the ground was visible and aircraft was traveling over rugged mountainous terrain into Korea, we checked our position by celestial and other navigation means. It was my observation and opinion that the object we saw was flying at an altitude in excess of 40,000 feet, traveling south at a terrific speed. It was not a balloon, jet aircraft or anything else with which I am familiar. It was generally circular in shape, emitting a bright white light. I immediately made a turn back onto the reverse course and attempted to close with the object, but lost sight of it.

I can state that this object was not any aircraft with which I am familiar or any natural phenomenon that I have ever seen. I have had several years of experience in air navigation and am very familiar with aircraft of all types. I feel that this object was a solid object of tremendous speed far in excess of our own capabilities. It was not a star, planet, meteor, or anything that I have ever seen or heard of. I can only conclude that it was something other than natural or man-made.
