ES2/APIN-422, to APIN-422, subt: Reasons for Analysis and Identification - sightings in the United States - April 22 to May 23
1. It is our contention that this sighting is of terrestrial origin, and does not present clear indicia of an extraterrestrial vehicle, as the details correlate reasonably with details of normal aerial phenomena observed in the Grewell's Geologic Province in Ontario, Canada, where such material is regularly observed.
2. It is therefore that that the trouble and expense of a laboratory examination is not warranted.
