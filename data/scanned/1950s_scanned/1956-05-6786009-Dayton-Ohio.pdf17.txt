Case #59, Ottawa, Canada, May 15, 1956 - We are advised this incident is number 59. It possibly involves a "UFO", but because it may typify certain cases we are omitting the time, duration, and other details except as they may pertain to the Canadian government's interest (or the cover-up, but feel that CIRKO readers should be provided with sufficient data to evaluate all reports) for the record from the Cincinnati Enquirer as follows: "The U.S. Air Force ministry said a false alarm for sending up jet planes was created when a sighting was reported by radar but not immediately identified. Before the interception was carried through, the "unknown" objects as an Air Force transport returning from the Arctic." The jets met the transport at very high altitudes, said the RCAF, and after further identification, were called off. There were other bases and some damage, and to use up excess fuel that might have endangered the landing, Canmore said the planes just fell. There has been no indication of trouble. All evidence points to the likelihood of satisfactory explanation in a major five from a very high altitude," he said. "It looks like just a routine mission to the Arctic."
