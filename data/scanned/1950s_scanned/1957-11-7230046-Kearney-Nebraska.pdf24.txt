THE DAYTON DAILY NEW

INTER-PLANETARY?

Saucers Real,
Researcher Says

ALAMOGORDO, N. M., July 29-- (IP)-- Dr. Carl
Jung, Swiss psychologist, says in a report that Unidenti-
fied Flying Objects are real and “shown signs of intelli-
gent guidance by quasi-human pilots.”

“I can only say for certain
that things are not a mere
rumor, something has been
seen,” Jung said in the re-
port released yesterday. “A
purely psychological explana-
tion is ruled out." 

Jung, who started his research
on UFO's in 1944, released his
report through the UFO filter
center of the aerial phenomena
research organization here. It
was released by J. L. Lorenzen,
Holloman Air Force base.

“I have gathered a mass of
observations on unidentified fly-
ing objects since 1944,” Jung said. 

“THE DISCS do not behave
in accordance with physical
laws, but as thought without
weight ... 

“If the extra-terrestrial origin
of this phenomenon should be
confirmed this would prove the
existence oi an intelligent
inter-planetary relationship.
What such a fact might mean
for humanity cannot be pre-
dicted.

“But it would put us without
doubt in the extremely pre-
carious position of primitive
communities in conflict with
the superior culture of the
whites ... 

“That the construction of
these machines proves a scien-
title technique immensely su-
perior to ours cannot be
argued."
