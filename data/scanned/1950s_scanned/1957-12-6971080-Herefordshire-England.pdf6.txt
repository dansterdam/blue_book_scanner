1. Attached letter and report transmitted to this Center via AIR.
2. Our understanding that all letters addressed to U.S. Embassies and Attaches
result in copies being forwarded to this Center. Noted.
3. A few items from our findings upon which to base a reply:
a. Object not conclusively identified as yet, from the characteristics
and other descriptions given was probably a Balloon of "rehash" -- a large number which have been observed during the last 12 months.
b. We are struck by the fact that (apparently) he just finished Keyhoe's
book, and sent in a UFO report on the back cover, after seeing that
the Keyhoe book and UFO's in the area coincided.
