Dear Sir:

I had read of a meteorite in Alabama so I have decided to write you about a sighting that occurred in our yard and back yard on the night of Nov. 23, 1954. We were asleep in bed when a bright light awakened us. We jumped up and went to the window to see what it was. We saw a round, glowing object hovering over the trees which I thought indicated great heat. There was no noise and no vapor trails as it hovered there. It remained there for about 5-10 minutes and then shot straight up and disappeared. It did not fall or descend but just shot up and was gone instantly. Rather these things deteriorate. I have them.

I have given many pieces away in an attempt to find out what they are and I succeed. However, I am standing firm to everyone over the fact that I still keep them and show them. I am a standup joke to everyone concerned.

I would dearly love to know if they really are meteorites and I think you would know. 

Thanking you kindly,
Mrs. -----
