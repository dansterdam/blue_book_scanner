AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. 2D-UFOB-3-56 PART FOUR
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
1. In the opinion of the preparing officer the sighting as observed by the witnesses was caused by an optical phenomenon. A temperature inversion reported in the area of the sighting may have been a contributing factor to the occurrence.
2. Supplementary investigative efforts and the descriptions of sighting provided by police officers and other eyewitnesses indicate that the object was caused by a balloon, possibly a meteor or some other aerial object rather than a type of optical phenomenon as indicated. 
COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
1. This headquarters does not concur with the opinion of the preparing officer that this sighting was caused by an optical phenomenon. Inasmuch as the object appeared to be a solid object and approached and receded in relation to the balloon, a type of optical phenomenon is indicated.
2. In the opinion of this headquarters that this sighting was caused by the 22/200 carbon radiosonde balloon released from the U.S. Weather Bureau at Shreveport, La. On Aug 25th, 1956. The investigation unit placed a 500 gram radiosonde balloon in the area of the sighting at the time of the sighting. 
3. The motion and the manner of flight of the object observed is consistent with the performance characteristics known to be generated by the passing aircraft coupled with the jet exhaust which would create the illusion of the passage of a large object. A falling child's balloon with an open hand would stimulate this action.
