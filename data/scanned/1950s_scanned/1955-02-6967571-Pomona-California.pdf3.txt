The image does not appear to contain a photograph. Instead, the image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, with handwritten text. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now proceed to extract and output all the text found in the document:

The Air Force investigator was unable to identify the lights observed by the witness. The case was classified as "Unidentified" due to lack of sufficient information.
