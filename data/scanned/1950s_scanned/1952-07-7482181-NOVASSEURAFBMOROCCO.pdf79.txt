Capt. February 2, 1952

Book, incidentally, I should have indicated that it is this book that prompts my writing time to a debate with you and Dr. Hansey. I know though I may not express with any success what I am driving at, I certainly cannot believe and have fairly certain the position of the defences as a result of such contacts. This is something which I certainly cannot do.

I am not going over this question of burden of proof again, but the facts records show examples where one of the prime tests for a U.F.O. and points has been eliminated. This were supported pilots. The record of the matter was admittedly not thorough, and nothing was final and conclusive proof, that I have claimed.

As for the "solecism" when someone produces a text as a actual case of a possible sighting, however the point that I know cannot make with either you or Dr. Hansey, and certainly not with out particular pattern. We have definite answers for most of these, including even the "will to believe" that some of the cases where factual data is clearly missing, such as the possible the lack of of a Sighting or the lack of anything to match those cases where the data are available and where by consequences the identity of an extraterrestrial source was identified.

With reference to the reflection to the reflection on television. I do not recall ever having been consulted by television or I.V.H. Most of these I have to turn down because of the pressure of other business. Despite a number of times when I have written I prefer to refer in travel. Certainly, if I did turn that one down, it was not unkind to do with. I would have to compare dates to say, but I do not think I was out of the country. We would have to compare dates to see. But I do a tremendous amount of work through my office with nervous and yet I am not entirely certain through my office whether I should have accepted since it such an investigation from Capt. Hall other. I do not even know who he is.

Charles Manasy, who has also written me, and to whom I intend to send a copy of this letter, where I am of the chance "non-terrestrial "U.F.O.'s." This I expect to use this term "non-terrestrial".

Perhaps the reason why I am taking the time to correspond with you is due to the fact that your sighting is unique. I have not seen official records of each your claim that sightings like yours were seen in many areas.
