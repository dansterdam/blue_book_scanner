Dear Dr. Haines:

Here are two more unusual sightings from the ATIC file. These incidents, while not established as being of an extraterrestrial nature, are nevertheless of significant interest and will be forwarded for your information. 

1. The ATIC file does not contain any information on the sighting reported to us by Mrs. Mildred H. Glover of 523 East Boulevard, Duluth, Minnesota. 

2. Sorry to have taken so long, but we are in limited operation and are just now getting to these reports.

I am glad to hear of the progress which you and your staff are making in the study of these cases. It continues to amaze me that so little has been done publicly regarding the factual data that has been collected. However, I realize the complexities and difficulties involved in handling these sightings.

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

Sincerely,

EDWARD J. RUPPELT
Chairman, USAF Scientific - Technical
Liaison Office, Universal Phenomena Group
