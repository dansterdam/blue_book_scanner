REPORT A-18-33 
At approximately 9:28 PM, November 7, 1955, Mrs. Z___ telephoned the Ocala, Florida Air Force Base (ADC Direction Center) and reported the sighting of a bright object in the sky traveling at a high rate of speed. Mrs. Z____ stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape and was emitting sparks or fire tails. At the same time, Mr. Z____ also telephoned the air base and reported the sighting of the same object. The object was observed by the Z____ family for approximately 15-20 minutes. 
The object reportedly traveled in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed, then suddenly changed course to a southwesterly direction and disappeared from sight. No aircraft were reported in the area at the time of the sighting.
The Ocala Air Force Base immediately notified the 20th Air Division, MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida, of the sighting.
