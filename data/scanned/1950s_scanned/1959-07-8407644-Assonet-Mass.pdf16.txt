The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document with handwritten text.

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Yes I could not complete your questionnaire because the UFO sighting lasted only a few seconds. The UFO was startling on the hil1s1de above us. It was a fast moving object with a long tail, like a shooting star in slow motion. White or bright red and seemed to hesitate and then move off rapidly. It moved toward the west and then at an angle, and finally disappeared. It was moving so fast that I could not get a camera in time to photograph it. What has been printed about color change and hovering is not correct. This moving aerial object was observed by several others who were with me at the time.

I drew a hasty sketch of the object just as I saw it. The sketch shows the relative path of the object to the hills and its apparent motion. The color change and hovering which I have read about in other UFO reports was not characteristic of this one. It just appeared, moved rapidly and disappeared. There was no sound and no trail except a faint one. This whole thing was over in a few seconds and it was necessary to act quickly, so I did not get a photograph or detailed drawing. I regret this but the object was gone so fast I could not react in time. I am sure this UFO was something not explainable from any natural or manmade source.
