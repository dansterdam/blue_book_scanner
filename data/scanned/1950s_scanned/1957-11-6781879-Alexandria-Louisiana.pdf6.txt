No Case (Information Only)
7 November 1957
Meridian, Mississippi

The following morning, November 7th, a truck driver named Melvin Stevens said he encountered an egg-shaped object on the highway near Ridgeland, Mississippi. From it emerged three "queer-looking people" with "pasty-white faces and dark hair." They "hesitated" unintelligibly, and then with "pasty-white hands," a companion corroborated his story.
