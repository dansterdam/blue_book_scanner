1. The 35mm color transparency received for examination is inconclusive rather than diagnostic.

2. The so-called "spot" could have been caused by the following:
a. Specular reflection or refraction
b. Reflection from a glass window
c. Double exposure
d. Developing flaws.

3. The sun striking the lens, possibly with water droplets on the lens, is the most reasonable explanation for the "spot". The fact that the image is an additional reason to suspect sun "flare".
