RE: 52-239

Gentlemen:

We have been trying to learn the conclusions by the Air Force of two alleged sightings in the Udine, Italy area.

Correspondence with Lt. Col. J.L. Jordan, Chief, Information Services Division, USAF, indicates that they were unable to identify or confirm the descriptions of unidentified flying objects that have been made by these officials in the area, and the fact that they were not reported officially at the time of the sightings.

If, however, they were not identified and not reported, this would constitute a violation of Project BLUE BOOK procedures as prescribed in
Information regarding these sightings follows:

(a) In September 1957 and a fireman in a patrol car saw and attempted to follow a luminous object in the sky that was seen to descend behind some trees.

(b) In July 1958, two civilians reported seeing a bright red object pass overhead at a very high speed. This object was witnessed by several people and the sighting was officially reported. (Record Bureau Number 51335.)

It would like to be sure that the official conclusions in these cases were in accordance with AFR 200-2, Section 9.

Respectfully yours,
Director
