The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document describing a radar sighting event that occurred on August 6 at approximately 0230 hours. The document discusses the targets detected by the radar, their speed and altitude, and the nature of the radar returns. The document concludes that the radar returns were likely caused by some phenomenon other than interference.

On the morning of August 6, at approximately 0230 hours, the radar scope observed what seemed to be targets traveling at very high speed, estimated to be well above eight hundred knots an hour.

These targets were painting on a slight angle, not perpendicular to the scope when it appeared. According to the report, this suggested that the targets were tracked by interference from another radar site. If it was interference, it was not like any that I have ever seen on this radar site.

The returns looked very much like ordinary targets except for the slight angle when they appeared. It was reported that if these targets occurred between this station and another, they could be definitely classified as interference.

However, since the returns were seen traveling in two different directions at times, it is very likely that there are two more radar sets within our range transmitting on the same frequency. I would say that these returns were caused by some other phenomenon other than interference.
