The image provided does not contain any photographs; it shows a page with handwritten text which is upside down. I'll attempt to provide the text as it appears (rotating it mentally to read), but please be aware that handwriting can be difficult to interpret accurately:

-----
[Handwritten text starts, but is cut off at the top]

...גיע וקרן וקרן
ובאור עז כי אז
המלאכים נראים

[Handwritten text is unclear and difficult to read]

...הטפים
זי[???]והי ש[????]וק
...ות עבודה

--- End of text snippet ---

The above representation might not be accurate due to the difficulty in deciphering the handwriting. The text appears to be in Hebrew, but without clear visibility and context, providing a precise transcription is challenging.
