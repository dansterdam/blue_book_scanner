Performing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the text in the document:

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "X" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension. 

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand (Circle One):
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Nickel
e. Quarter
f. Half dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22.)
a. Certain
b. Fairly certain 
c. Not very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Slowly, gradually, suddenly, straight, or did it no longer visible?

24. In order that you may give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, would you please imagine that you could recreate a model of what you observed? Describe in your own words what that model would be like, and what characteristics it would have of the object or objects which when viewed up in the sky would give the same appearance that you observed.

The best I can do is to say that it would be a real bright, highly polished brass, somewhat in the shape of a bullet but tapered at both ends. As for the size I'd have no idea - it did not appear to be as large as the average airliner. More perhaps like a jet- or DC-4.
