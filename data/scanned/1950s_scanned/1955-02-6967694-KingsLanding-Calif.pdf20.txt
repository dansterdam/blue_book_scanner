COMMENTS (for further distribution if necessary)
1. Mr. report was received in early August 1955, through representatives. This report was analyzed as an experimental (aircraft) in spite of the apparent it was claimed that it was 15,000 feet long and 100 feet wide - all answers to representative facts. 
2. The tone of Mr. Wabba' latest letter seems to indicate that this man is a frustrated ex-BA, and will be satisfied only by having this frustration satisfied.
The ATIC has no intention of sending anyone to talk with Mr. concerning a case under four years old. It is felt that the first answer to this man through representative Wabba was more than adequate.
