Dear Sir,

We are investigating the enclosed photograph which was taken in nearby Denville, N.J. on the night of 18 April 1959.

Although we have many avenues to obtain some kind of conclusions connected with this sighting, we would appreciate it very much if you could look into the matter and, if possible, give us the results of your study.

Any help you can give us in reaching a conclusion to this puzzle would be appreciated. If it can be of any further assistance to call on me, please feel free to call on me either by mail or telephone at Jefferson 3-2993.

I look forward with great interest to your reply.

Sincerely yours,

[Signature redacted]

Encls.
