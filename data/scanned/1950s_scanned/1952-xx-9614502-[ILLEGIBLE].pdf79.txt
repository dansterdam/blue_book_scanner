Statement ( Col John A.F. Miller (conta) ( UNCLASSIFIED
The attached letter came to this office Indicating about this subject. He stated that he had not and was as sceptic as most people of the existence of flying saucers. Our investigation was completed about 4:30 A.M. At that time we did have his sign a single statement that Lt. Although had signed, to the effect that the noise taken were true and accurate.
I took him to my hotel room after we had joined up at the service station at Williston. He admitted to me at that time that he was in the hotel until 7:00 A.M. and then returned to the Trailer Center.
I had him describe the object and give me dimensions as I attempted to measure it. Again, I was impressed with the details that he remembered and wondered if he was a fabrication of his own mind. It is felt, however, that individuals combined on certain aspects except for the dimensions, do not have characteristics generally reported. The propelled platform that might have the characteristics reported by
this witness appears onoother.

Mr. ---------- was quite concerned in getting off the monthly payment on his car and to a question asked, he was backing or paying on the car in question here at Williston. When I arrived he stated that he might be getting a job at Williston, N. Dak. which is approximately 200 miles from home. He did state he did not do. He wanted to get him to read and sign the initial statement which I have counselled for him from the note and his discussion of the subject.

In the interest of this I am forwarding them with out my signature that appears only on one page of the notes.

John A.F. Miller
