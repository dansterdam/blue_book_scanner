The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document discussing the first eclipse of 1958 and providing a celestial time table for April.

First Eclipse of 1958
April also brings the first eclipse of 1958, but it will not be visible in most of North America. This happens on April 19, when the new moon will come directly between the earth and sun. There will be a total eclipse of the sun, but only those in the Pacific Ocean southwest of South America and the southern tip of Africa will be able to see it.

Celestial Time Table for April
The image provides a detailed celestial time table for various celestial events in April, including the times for sunrise, sunset, moon phases, and other astronomical occurrences.
