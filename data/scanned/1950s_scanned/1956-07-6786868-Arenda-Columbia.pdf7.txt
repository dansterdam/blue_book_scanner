The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document that contains a newspaper article translation about a strange flying object sighting. The text describes an object that was observed over a cemetery in Arenda, whose resident, named Luna, collected metal pieces from the object after a series of explosions. The object is described as resembling a blue cloud that was so bright that the person had to protect their eyes. The recovered pieces were handed over to the SIC (presumably some investigative agency).
