     No exhaust could be seen.
General remarks: I was astonished when it first appeared and
couldn't imagine what it could have been. It was nothing like anything I
had seen before. It doesn't seem possible that it could have been a plane
as no sound could be heard and no object could be seen other than the fire
and sparks.
