The image contains two sketches. The first one shows a curved line with the instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to indicate how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it, and a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

The second sketch shows two landscapes - one on the left depicting a road and buildings in the distance, and one on the right that resembles a half-circle or dome shape.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. (This sketch is an example of how to complete the larger sketch.)
