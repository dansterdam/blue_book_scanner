WITNESS: Mr & Mrs. Richard T. Plummer 
ADDRESS: Shiloh, Ohio

DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT:

On the evening of June 30, 1957, at approximately 9:30 p.m., Mr. and Mrs. Richard T. Plummer observed an unidentified flying object while driving along Route 224 near Shiloh, Ohio. The object was described as a dull reddish-orange color, round in shape, and approximately 25-30 feet in diameter. It was observed for approximately 3 minutes before disappearing from view.

INVESTIGATOR'S REPORT:

The Plummers were interviewed on 15 July 1957. They stated that the object was at an altitude of approximately 600 feet and moved in a horizontal direction at a constant speed. No sound was heard, and no trail or exhaust was visible. The object appeared to be self-luminous.

The Plummers claim to have taken a photograph of the object, but the quality of the print is poor and does not clearly show the object. A copy of the photograph is attached.
