This document appears to contain a detailed map or chart with various geographical features, coordinates, and other textual information. The text on the image is too small and blurry for me to accurately transcribe, as an OCR system would struggle to reliably extract the text from this low-resolution scan. Without a higher quality source image, I cannot provide a full text output.
