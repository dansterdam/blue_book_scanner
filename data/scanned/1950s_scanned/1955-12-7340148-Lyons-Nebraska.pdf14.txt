Dear T. A. O. Rully:

We enclosed herewith material which was forwarded to this office by the State Game and Forestration Commission, which they received from a man in Wyoming reporting the sighting of an unidentified object. 

General Swininger has seen it, and states that inasmuch as this party appears to be very sincere, we should forward it to your office.

Yours truly,
Austin J. Bacon
Deputy State Director
