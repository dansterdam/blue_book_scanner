The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document. It contains a graph or diagram with various lines, angles, and measurements, but no photograph is visible in this particular image.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now produce the text found in the document:

POWER STATION - TENN.
LAKE CITY. TENNESSEE

OBJECT OBSERVED:
At approximately 1900 hours on 6 February 1958, a highly luminous egg-shaped object was observed hovering about 200 feet above the ground near a 300 IV. 66.000 volt AC power transmission line about one mile southeast of the TVA Powder River Steam Plant near Lane City. Tennessee.

The object was about 30 feet in diameter and appeared to be illuminated from within. It hovered silently for approximately 5 minutes, then accelerated at terrific speed and disappeared from sight in a northeasterly direction.

Witnesses to the sighting included the shift supervisor at the power plant and three other plant employees. All observers agreed that the object was not an airplane, balloon, helicopter, or any other conventional aircraft. The local Civil Air Patrol and FAA office were notified of the sighting.

THE SHIFT SUPERVISOR STATED THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO CAUSE INTERMITTENT POWER FLUCTUATIONS ON THE 66,000 VOLT LINE DURING THE PERIOD IT WAS UNDER OBSERVATION.
