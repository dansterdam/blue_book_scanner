Great, red, glowing blur. It was immense and shapeless in the fuzzy, hazy smog. It was resting in the sky, perfectly still, immobile. For a time I wondered if it could be a red searchlight. But then, no searchlight could be that large. It did not move and there was no red of light beaming up to the glowing blur. It just stood there, something awfully and sinister, watching and studying us silently and furtively. It was not making a sound. When suddenly it moved itself and flashed off in a red streak. It made no sound at all. This one was not outside of our atmosphere and that is for sure. It was hovering in the air over Hollywood, high enough to be catching and reflecting the light of the sun, which was already far below the western horizon.

Strangely enough, the ones I saw in September 1951 did not make me shudder with an eerie dread as did the one in 1946. Perhaps it seemed so similar so sinister because it was no silent, sneaky looking being shrouded in the mist.

I am attaching herewith an exact map of the heavens for the day, date, hour and place when I saw those strange space ships in 1951. Your guess as to good as mine from whence they came, but there is a logical conclusion to be drawn from the positions of the planets of our system as shown in the chart herewith.

They appeared from away up in the sky, far to the west, so it is obvious they did not come from Jupiter. As you may see on the chart Jupiter was conjointing the eastern horizon.

They could not have come from Uranus, for Uranus was at the point of the horizon exactly opposite to where the strange objects appeared.
