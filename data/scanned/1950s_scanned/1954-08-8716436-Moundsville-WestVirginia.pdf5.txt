LAMES FOIL "CLUMSY" ESPIONAGE ATTEMPT
Stockholm, in English to Eastern North America, Aug. 24, 1954, 1200 GMT--E
A thoroughly clumsy attempt at espionage was described in yesterday's issue of the Danish newspaper POLITIKEN-BLADET. It took place on Aug. 24 at a military camp where a Polish guard on duty tried to coax military information out of a young Danish soldier. The guard, however, refused to be drawn in. He drove away in haste and sent in a report of the incident, giving away its license number. The completed investigation showed that the car belonged to the Polish legation in Copenhagen.
