1. Case 162. Cincinnati, 17 June 1956 - The following is the report to CRIFOR by a member of the Cincinnati Astronomical Society, who watched the strange object with several other observers. According to the report, he was awakened, watched the strange object through an open window. At first it was a stationary, silent brilliant spot in the northwest sky, about 15 degrees above the horizon. Then it seemed to move closer, and without declining in brilliance, it became almost twice the size of the moon, was fiery red and shaped like a bowl facing downwards. Dangling from the bottom were bright red streamers. In view for about 10 minutes, the object then returned rapidly, becoming a pinpoint of light, then disappeared. On request of the observer, the witnesses watched the same area the next night, but saw nothing.

2. Next is the dangling red streamers which bears similarity to "streams of light streaming downward" described by in Case 162. Another point, no other person reported the dangling streamers as an indication of tremendous size. Such would indicate that the object was armed and was a test of some device, perhaps for new weapons or Satellites being developed. Written per field survey.
CRIFOR would have heard.
