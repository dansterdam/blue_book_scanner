Transcribed text:
"Because of seeming inaction, there is some surprise that no action has been taken on this report of February 15, 1952. I do not feel that this report necessarily requires any investigation, chiefly because the sighting appears to be a natural phenomenon. The right hand side of the object sighted was illuminated, indicating the sunlight was strong enough to cause this effect. With the distance of the object and the illumination, I believe this can be satisfactorily explained as the moon rising with one side illuminated by the sun.

Any comments or further details on this report are not necessary, since it has been thoroughly discussed in the North Prussia Field Office and the analysis I have given appears to be correct. Ild."
