STATEMENT

As approximately 2315 hours, 25 March 1953, I was standing in the yard of my residence at 214 Vanderbilt, San Antonio, Texas, looking to the north sky. At this time, I noticed a bright light which I thought at first was a shooting star. However, when I noticed that it was traveling in a circular course, I called Mr. and Mrs. to come out observe it also. The lights appeared to be in the north and were traveling on a southerly course at a very high speed. They disappeared by traveling over the south sky, another appeared in the north, and flew approximately the same course. At no time were there more than three lights visible at one time. Occasionally one would change course and circle the city on approximately a fifteen mile radius in a clockwise direction. The speed appeared to be faster than any aircraft known to be stationed at this base or used by commercial airlines. At one time, one of the objects passed through the halo light of the moon and a trail, similar to a vapor trail, appeared, but this did not remain visible. The most unusual thing about what was seen was the tremendous speed and complete lack of sound. About fifteen minutes after noticing the first light, Mr. telephoned the Project BLUE BOOK control tower. He checked later and learned that they had been looking at the objects also. I feel that this type of phenomena control center was not contacted sooner.
