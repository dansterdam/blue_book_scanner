COMMENTS (To narrative refer, expand on your findings and recommendations and conclusions with full guidance and helpful criticisms re-garding the report. Comment on the significance or significance if the report reflects adverse conditions):
As a result of the observations of a colored light streaming across the sky over Tokyo, there were of little value, although admittedly the UFO could be a meteorite, if the sightings Cine-in-sight reported were over estimated. However, this Center cannot conduct on-the-spot investigations and detailed checks, it must rely on the overseas tracking the sightings.
