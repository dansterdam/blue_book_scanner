SUMMARY: Object was sighted at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on 20 September 1950. Sighted by Major S. A. Slaw, Mr. Group Intelligence Officer.

THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS MADE BY S/SGT.
assigned to the 509th Bomb Squadron of the 509th Bomb Group, Medium, Walker Air Force Base, Roswell, New Mexico:

"At approximately 2100 hours on 20 September 1950 while on Guard Duty on the east side of the 509th Bomb Group Area, I observed a bright white light appear about 500 feet south east of the base perimeter. It seemed to be at an altitude of approximately (100) feet, and covered a distance of approximately (300) yards in about 2 to 3 seconds. I called the attention of Corporal and Private First Class to the object, and they also observed the same. The object then disappeared from view. At approximately two (2) miles northwest of the base the object seemed merely to disappear. The following morning Corporal and Private First Class listed airman also saw the same object at the same time."

A check with Base Operations revealed that there were no aircraft in the local area at this time.

A check with the Base Weather Station revealed that the ceiling was twenty-three thousand (23,000) feet and that visibility was fifteen (15) miles.

The early warning radar Station, this Base, was inoperative at the time of this observation.
