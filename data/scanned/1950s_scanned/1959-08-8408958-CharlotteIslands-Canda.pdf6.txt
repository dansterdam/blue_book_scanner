STATEMENT
"At about 0545 Z the pilot called me to take a look out at 6 o'clock to see if I saw an aircraft. I did and saw it and it was not part of our formation. It had a rotating beacon but no nose lights nor tail lights. After I sighted it, it descended and then descended to the right of our formation out of sight. I also picked the return up on my radar at about 4 o'clock in Az. and at 3000 to 4000 yards. At 0600 Z Blue Lead tail gunner picked the target up at 12,000 yards in long range, then I switched to long range and pick it up at 5,000 yards. at 6 o'clock Az.
