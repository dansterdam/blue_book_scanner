The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with the letter "A" placed on it, and an object above the horizon. The second sketch contains two larger sketches. The one on the left shows a road with buildings and trees on either side, and a person walking on the road. The one on the right shows a silhouette of a mountain or hill against the sky.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object appeared to be in the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
