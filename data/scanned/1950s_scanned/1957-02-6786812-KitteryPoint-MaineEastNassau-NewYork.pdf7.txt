13. Statements of Observers:
Mrs. related she was out in the yard on the south side of her house looking down her washing line over to the southeast. The object appeared in the northeast and rapidly came toward her, glowed with a very bright colored light and about the size of a softball surrounded by a very bright glowing white light which illuminated the yard around. The object seemed to almost stop in its course and then dropped quickly and did not rise or leave any small light or residue. It appeared brighter than moonlight. The object was described as a large round dark colored body with a brighter light around the center and no noise or exhaust was observed. It appeared to angle down after passing overhead of the observers. It appeared to be the same color and shape as it came in and went out of view. It was a cold, dark night with no wind blowing.
