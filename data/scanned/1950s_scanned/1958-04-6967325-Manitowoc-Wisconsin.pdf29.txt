The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document or transcript that seems to be part of a UFO investigation or report. I will now proceed to extract all the textual information from the document and provide the output:

Commander Basset: I'm very interested in what's going on.
Sister: How what is your name?
Sister: Oh, last night did you call the Traffic Bureau, the sheriff's office?
I called the operator first and she called the other office.
You were dispatched investigators immediately to this sight?
That is right.
How many would you say there were? There was one. I don't know how large, but quite large and it would flare up.
One was near the ground and quite large.
What were the shape of these lights?
Circular would you say like a disc? 
Like your hand outstretched, how big would it appear to be? Would it be like the size of a pail?
Size of a pear? 
Bigger? 
How about a dime?
A nickel?
Bigger than a dollar?
Lemon? 
Dollar? 
Grapefruit?
Basketball?
More like a basketball.
Size of a basketball. What color did it have?
Fruit of the line it was a clear light and it reflected light. The image was one and then it looked like a star. We're checking about the big one now.
A white light?
Some white and it turned different colors.
Any other colors?
It flared and turned different colors after it flared.
From white to orange and blue and red?
That is right.
Did you both see them at the same time?
Were they in any particular formation, were they side by side, one above the other?
One was above the other.
How big would you say that was?
About the size of a basketball.
When it was higher up?
