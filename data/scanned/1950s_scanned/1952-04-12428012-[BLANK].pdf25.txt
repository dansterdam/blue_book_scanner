The preliminary report will give some point from which to
start the investigation. First we attempt to eliminate the factor
of mis-identification of known objects. We check the time and
place of all weather-balloon launching or of any research balloons.
And we use the Air Almanac to check the current locations of any
exceptionally bright and easily visible planets. You must under-
stand that this work is not at all an attempt to prove that
sightings are misinterpretations of known objects - we're simply
checking to see whether we should eliminate certain of the most
obvious possibilities.

If a field trip is necessary, we take off as soon as we can
and conduct a personal interview with the witness or witnesses.
In this connection, a very important thing is getting to witnesses
quickly, while their experience is still fresh in their minds.
We also ask the local intelligence officer to make out a
standard Intelligence Form 112 on the incident and forward it through
channels. This gives us a pretty complete picture, as a rule.
