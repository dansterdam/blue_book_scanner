AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FROM: AATS 30073 AlAS, IIAAP3 
SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
REFERENCE NO. 29-R-4a
We reached a point on the highway near the Aroostook Union Grange Hall where we observed a strange object for approximately 1 minute. At this time the object appeared to be moving away, considering the fact that it seemed to be farther away. The light seemed to be about the size of the North Star, smaller than a 1-inch ball. It emitted a steady light with no variation in intensity. It was moving in a Northerly direction.
We continued our journey toward Presque Isle, still observing the light through the windshield. The light seemed to disappear at a point near Presque Isle, having maintained a steady course the entire time. it turned sharply toward the east, then as it faded gradually away.
We are very familiar with the area described above and the location of Presque Isle. The weather conditions were very good during the entire observation with the brightness of the star in the west being the only object of comparison. The light was much brighter than the brightest star in the west and found it to be two (2) to three (3) times the size. The above described actions during the entire sighting (15) minutes at various speeds and altitudes with excellent visibility, clear sky, no wind, moon out and all stars clearly distinguished.
