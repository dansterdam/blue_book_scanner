Dear Dr. Hynek:

I have been asked to examine certain photographs taken of a purported "flying saucer" near Guatemala City on December 9, 1952.

The photographs in question were taken by a citizen of Guatemala who wishes to remain anonymous. In view of the confidential nature of this case, I shall refrain from revealing his name.

My examination of the photographs leads me to conclude that they are not the result of a photographic trick or hoax. The images depicted are clearly not man-made aircraft of any kind known to me. However, I cannot state with certainty that they represent an extraterrestrial vehicle. More information would be needed to make a definitive judgment.

I hope this preliminary analysis is of some use to you in your investigations of this intriguing case. Please let me know if you require any further information from me.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]
James A. Creighton
Entomologist
