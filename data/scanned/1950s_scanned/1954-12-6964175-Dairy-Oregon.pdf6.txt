The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a document, possibly a Project Blue Book report, with some handwritten text at the bottom that says "Ni".

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I can extract the following text from the document:

23/ 331/2 DEC JPDV
