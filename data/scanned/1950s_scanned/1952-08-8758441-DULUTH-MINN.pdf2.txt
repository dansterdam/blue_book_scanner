Since I have taken pilot balloon observations for 20 years
I know that the phenomenon was not one usually
observed. The position did not change in the theodolite
for a full minute. With respect to movement this
leaves three possibilities for that minute: 1- The object
did not move; 2- The object climbed at 2200 above the horizontal
in the direction at 227.3' 3 - The object descended at 2200 above
the horizontal in the direction at 227.3'

Since moving the theodolite caused the object to move
across the field of vision it probably could not have
been caused by any defect in the instrument
