II. RANGER OBSERVATION

A. Discussion
The report indicates that on the night of September 10, 1951, a ranger at Sandy Hook, New Jersey observed an unidentified flying object. The object was described as having a bright light that seemed to be shifting between white, green, and orange colors. The object moved silently and erratically, making rapid changes in direction and speed. The ranger observed the object for several minutes before it disappeared from view.

B. Conclusion
Based on the details provided, the ranger's observation appears to be of a genuine unidentified flying object. The report states that the object exhibited characteristics not consistent with known aircraft or other explainable phenomena. Further investigation may be warranted to try to determine the nature and origin of the observed object.
