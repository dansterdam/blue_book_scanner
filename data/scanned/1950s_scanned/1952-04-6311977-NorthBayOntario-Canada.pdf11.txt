In the sky were passed on to the board from the observers, and when they appeared reasonably scientific, they were looked into carefully.

There has been nothing yet to convince us that the reports we have are not possible and of real validity, Dr. Mackenzie said. At times we have had the subjects so close that we should have been able to see them and draw a conclusion. But we have not been able to do so. The new reports from the United States or elsewhere have not given us any more confidence. 

We are keeping our minds open and studying the situation as it develops, Dr. Mackenzie said. There are many things that become available that give us cause for concern.

The theory has been advanced already that saucers could come from outside the earth. Others say it is just a psychological trick of the mind. We have to check on nuclear fission developments. The physicists infer the space men may be anxious over the possibilities of disturbing the cosmic balance. A German scientist now in the United States who was chief scientist at a wartime atomic energy plant in Germany has kept records of persons from all over the world who have claimed to have seen such things.
