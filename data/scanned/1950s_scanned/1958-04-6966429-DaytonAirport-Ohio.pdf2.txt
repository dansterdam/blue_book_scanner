The image provided does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text. I will now proceed to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the text and provide the output:

6. Observer states that a "car" was observed (station at 2:21) and that it seemed to be a cloud.
7. Observed a "mass" some 20 feet in diameter. This appeared to be some object with a "mist" or "cloud" surrounding it.
8. Appeared to be traveling approx. 50 "miles" per hour and very low - only a "few feet" from the ground. No noise and no exhaust were observed.
Middletown identity of some unidentified object (perhaps a cloud, or a weather or other natural phenomenon) as seen at The Dayton Airport near Ohio on April 6, 1958.
