Hours later - we have changed our opinion somewhat to last night's report. I hope it makes no difference. It is now no doubt what we saw last night was a pure cloud of smoke, there is no doubt about it whatever. This is one of my own beliefs and I would dislike have one or two others sharing this view. Taking. Here is the report. Please pass it around, but great care must be taken as I have no other, and this, if the contents be such, will be seen by several to Nor: - I would appreciate if you could send the lot back as soon as possible.
P.S. Do you think what should know about this? is at present in the Papua country and will not be returning home until 10th July at earliest. If people (him) it worth while to stand cost of a radio communication my behalf it It's interesting Territory news if nothing else.
