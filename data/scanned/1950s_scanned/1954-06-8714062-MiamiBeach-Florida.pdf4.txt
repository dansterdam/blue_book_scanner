SUBJECT: Unidentified object, statement on

1. At approximately 2100 on the evening of 22 June 1954, I was sitting on the balcony of my residence facing the Atlantic Ocean. I observed what appeared to be a "falling star" on a true bearing of approximately 090 degrees. This light suspended in angle of descent and intensity for a period of three to four seconds, approximately, this length of time I thought it was though it might be an aircraft in a steep dive (estimating altitude at 10,000 feet) and observed this light to increase in brilliance, angle of descent, and speed until it appeared to expend itself shortly up to an angle of 30 degrees above the horizontal (just above the horizon) then slow down and hover with a brilliance slightly greater than that of a first magnitude star. At this time it was on a true bearing of approximately 010 degrees. It called for major Swart and him so it could be seen as a small light in the distance which I was watching at this time. The light was somewhat larger than that of an aircraft. The light gradually faded in intensity and disappeared from view.

2. The light was visible for at least seven (7) minutes.

3. In my estimation of speed and altitude are imprecise.

4. I have never seen anything before that could be comparable to this observation.
