The handwritten text on the form states the following:

The object observed was rather strange in appearance and maneuver. It appeared quite large as seen in the sky and the way it moved was most unusual. I did observe it for a considerable period of time but never was able to get a clear, detailed view as it seemed to be rather high up. It would seem to hover and then dart off in a different direction at a rapid rate of speed. Then it would stop and hover again. The color seemed to be a bright reddish orange when it was visible. The sky was quite clear and there was plenty of daylight at the time. I do not know what it was, but it was most unusual and certainly not any type of known aircraft.
