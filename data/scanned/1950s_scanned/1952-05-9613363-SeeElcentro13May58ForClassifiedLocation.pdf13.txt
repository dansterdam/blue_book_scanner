AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT 

DISSEMINATION OF INTELLIGENCE
DISSEMINATION COPY
1-52
PAGE 3 OF 3 PAGES

COMMENT OF D/I:
It is quite possible that an aircraft of the USAF, a B-47, may have been observed, following or sighting the air target in various maneuvers. The close tight formation observed could have been an actual USAF air operation. However, the interrogation is designed to evidence that a definite weakness exists in the civil defense system and there is an immediate need for improved intelligence activities during peacetime when unidentified aircraft are sighted.
