11 February 1953

Lt Glen D. Parrish 
Director of Intelligence
5301 Air Dvision (Defense)
Kirtland AFB, New Mexico

Dear Glen:

I received your letter of 3 February 1953 and the enclosed clipping. Thanks for letting us know about this as we will probably get in on the sane somewhere anyway. His various clippings and data is rather interesting and inasmuch as the publicity has died down so that I doubt this particular investigation will get us much use, I am not sure just what we can do about this fellow, except to keep in touch with him and find out what happens and see that they have something are very willing to cooperate with the Air Force and Intelligence work.

When Lt Olsson and I were down at Kirtland, he may have mentioned the finding of the disc which they reported for a gliding at AFSZ. I checked and all I could find out was it was in the mill. I could not find out what has become of this incident since. As this present case they have quite a few applications they are receiving, and his problem is probably in that line.

In regard to the meeting we had with the Lee Olsson people, we checked and ascertained the details of their publication intentions and could find no correlation with rightness of unidentified flying objects, so we also eliminated their continued assistance on this matter. I hope they understand, though, as I do not wish to offend them as they were under the opinion that it was just one of those "freaks of nature" that they were aiming their attention to, the same thing, that they had not paid any attention to them. We are prejudiced to go on a bit more than they are, so will probably be seeing you in the near future.

Dont of luck and thanks for all the cooperation you have given us.

Yours very truly,

EDWARD J. RUPPELT
Captain, USAF
