1. A check was made with the Army Aviation Section and it was found they have six helicopters, H-37's, stationed in San Francisco area. These aircraft fit the description given by Mr.___ driving one large rotor. They have an engine on each side of the fuselage.
2. The conclusion of this Center is that Mr. H-37's flying in the area. These aircraft have been in production for approximately three years and probably are not based at very many locations.
