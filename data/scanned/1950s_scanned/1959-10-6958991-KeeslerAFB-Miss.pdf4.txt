At about 4:30 A.M. CST, airman [Redacted] and [Redacted] observed a bright round object with a brilliant light, pale blue in color, traveling in a southwesterly direction. It appeared to be about 60 feet in diameter and about 1000 feet in altitude. It was traveling at an estimated speed of 600 to 700 mph. The object made no sound and left no vapor trail. After traveling about 20 miles, it made an abrupt turn to the north and accelerated to an estimated speed of 3000 mph. It then made another abrupt turn to the northwest and disappeared from sight. The entire observation lasted about 2 to 3 minutes.
