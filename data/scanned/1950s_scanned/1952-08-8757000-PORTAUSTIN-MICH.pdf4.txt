THE FOLLOWING UNUSUAL RADAR TARGETS WERE OBSERVED BY PERSONNEL OF THE 754TH ACW STATION. PORT AUSTIN, MICH.
a. The radar images appeared to be one aircraft. The size of the images displayed varies in excess of 1200 knots. The radar tracks, as plotted by this station, are erratic and irregular.
b. The first object was observed at 0719Z, 6 August 1952. The last observation was at 0755Z, 6 August 1952 (approximately 3 minutes).
c. The electronic equipment employed at the time of observation was L-M14R-M3. The location of the observation was 44-05'N and 83.05'W. Altitude is approximately 575.66 feet Mean Sea Level. Frequency is 1275 megacycles.
d. The object's radar image was initially detected at 092° and 40 nautical miles from the site. The object traveled at an average speed of 2000 knots and reached a maximum speed of 4505 knots. The first contact was at 0946I, the last at 0957I, or 11 miles from the station - Georges Grid JA 0833, at 0742Z on a 280° bearing.
e. The weather and wind conditions at the time of observation are extracted and attached as Inclosure #6.
f. No intercept action was attempted.
