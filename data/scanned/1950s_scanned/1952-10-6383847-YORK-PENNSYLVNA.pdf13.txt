Gentlemen:

After completion of the copy of the enclosed report I find another from a clipping from an amateur report in Bronx, N.Y. which indicates that the object in question was a brilliant meteor or fireball. 

According to Fitts, F.M.F.E.S., "this indicates that it was undoubtedly a meteor and could not have been the object described by you. He gives colors as red, white, green, duration 2 to 5 seconds, no explosions or sound."

He saw it over Massachusetts. I could confirm this observation. Said it covered most of the sky.

Under Zodiacal light and meteor observations, said it followed.

He further drew the picture.

In view of these two good reports, there is absolutely no doubt that the object in question was not artificial, but was simply a brilliant meteor or bolide. If you wish the technical term for an exploding fireball.

Very truly,
