As requested, I will act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

Mr. **** had nothing but praise for him. He stated that he is a very good employee and he would hate to lose him. He also stated that in many ways **** seemed to be conscientious in his work. Up until 2 yrs ago he (Mr. ***) was complaining the **** was not conducting himself properly in his background. The police were called but no action was taken. On the morning of the storm he (Mr. ***) was notified by the telephone that the storm was approaching and he immediately called up **** and told him to come in. It was a very violent windstorm and did quite a bit of damage to his home. Mr. **** stated that his home was not damaged as severely as some of the others in the area. The most outstanding features was the tarp had been over a portion of his house with the tarpaulin and stated that he had crawled upon the roof and placed the tarp over the house since it was raining so much. He stated that the roof had been damaged and he was necessary to have this tarp placed. He further stated that the tarp had been brushing up against a 220 volt high tension line. The fact that the tarp had been grounded and removed caused him to believe that it was very likely to have caught on the roof in his storm and removed the tarp. At this time Mr. **** was not employed by the ********** and was from what he could ascertain about the whole thing there is a possibility that this tarp had been blown on the ground (where it appeared to be). All in all, Mr. **** had nothing but praise for him.

9. Dr. **** a physician in West Palm Beach, was contacted by Capt Garney and Capt. Kuppel. Dr. **** has been retained by the Police Department as a consultant. He stated that he is somewhat familiar with this aspect of medicine. He stated that he had had several contacts with this doctor and that he had been working at a City Service Gas Station in the city of West Palm Beach. This was approximately two years ago. He had done some other things. One of the instances was when they were having a meeting of many dealers in the southern part of Florida. He did not elaborate on these statements and since it was obvious that he appeared interested in psychiatry and psychology and the treatment of mental conditions, it appeared that this Dr. **** had some difficulty along that line.
