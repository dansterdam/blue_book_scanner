The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document discussing the publication of "flying saucers" books and the production of motion pictures related to the topic. The text in the document has been provided as follows:

17. In early 1955, five books written on "Flying Saucers" were published. To date, over 30 have been published and have received wide circulation here and abroad.

18. Up to now, six motion pictures dealing with "flying saucers" as their theme have been produced. One such picture was released in May 1956 and is still receiving some publicity. The plot of this movie is centered around two colored balls in a story of so-called "flying saucers." These film strips were previously submitted to the Air Force for examination, and considered to be seriously of moving spots of light against a blue sky. Our conclusions were that the objects in the film were reflections and in the main, stars of high standing, as well as by the CIA scientific panel which I previously mentioned.

19. With very few exceptions, both these self-appointed organizations and the books published, have been highly critical of the Air Force's handling of the UFO matter. They believe that many observations involving flying objects have not been properly explained or evaluated.
