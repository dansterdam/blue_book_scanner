Transcribing the text:

to ascertain if we could identify and possibly obtain a specimen of the object seen by the witness. I was advised by the witness that he had no such specimen to offer and that he did not have any photographs. I personally examined the site where the object was reported to have landed, but found no physical evidence to substantiate the report. The witness was unable to furnish any additional details regarding the object or its movements other than that reported earlier. I have therefore concluded that this report lacks sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation and recommend that it be classified as an INSUFFICIENT DATA case.
