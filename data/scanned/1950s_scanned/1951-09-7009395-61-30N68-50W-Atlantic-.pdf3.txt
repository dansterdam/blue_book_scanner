1. On 18 - 20 September 1951 three (3) B-36 type aircraft flew a training mission from Carswell AFB, Lakeview, Texas. Greenland, and return.

2. The following aircraft took part in the exercise:

a. 44-92568 - Major Paul E. Garhart, radar operator.
b. 44-92566 - 2/Sgt Donald E. Jenkins, ECM operator.
c. 44-92561 - 2/Sgt Doyt T. Larimore, ECM operator.

3. Individual reports are as follows:

a. At 1930/21Z, radar interference was noticed on the radar scope, which was initially determined to be an unidentified aircraft. This interference was observed continuously until the aircraft were 180 miles from the Texas coast, at which time the interference disappeared. The anti-jam device was in use. The interference appeared as a definite track on the radar scope.
b. Upon landing at Carswell AFB, the operators discussed the radar interference. Their conclusions were: (1) the interference was not ground clutter, (2) it was not jamming, and (3) it was not other aircraft participating in the mission. The radar interference was strong and definite and appeared to be airborne. The nearest known aircraft was at 150 miles, which should not have caused the strong interference noted.
c. Major Charles E. Brewster, the air executive officer, who was responsible for the exercise, was notified of the radar interference. He stated that he was aware of similar incidents in the past involving B-36 aircraft, but he could offer no explanation for the phenomenon.
