RESEMBLING A MAGNESIUM FLARE, CONTINUED IN AN DOWNWARD ARC
FROM NORTH TO SOUTH, AFTER ABOUT TEN SECONDS THIS ABJECT
INCREASED NOTICEABLE IN BRIGHTNESS AND THEN COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED
ABOUT FIFTEEN DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON. A WHITISH VAPOROUS
TRAIL LASTING ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE POINTS
OF THE INITIAL AND SECOND FLASH. THIS TRAIL WAS SAID TO RESEMBLE THAT
LEFT BY A JET AIRCRAFT BUT TO BE CONSIDERABLE LESS DENSE.
ALTHOUGH INITIALLY A SOLID TRAIL 10 BROKE UP INTO THREE SECTIONS IN
A FEW MINUTES AND THEN SLOWLY DISSIPATED.
TWO MORE OBSERVERS AT HALL LAKE AND ONE MORE AT WEST MELVILLE
WITNESSED THE PHENOMENON SHORTLY AFTER THE INITIAL FLASH BUT
DID NOT NOT ACTUALLY SEE THE INITIAL FLASH. THIERE ATTENTION WAS
PROBABLY ATTRACTED TO THE OBJECT BY THEISECOND FLASH. THEIR
REPORTS WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL THE OTHER OBSERVERS.
ALTHOUGH, THESE VAR OUS OBSERVERS WERE WIDELY SEPARATED THERE IS A
REMARKABLE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE OBSERVATIONS WITH ONLY MINOR
VARIATIONS HEIGHT AND DISTANCE ESTIMATES. I AM OF THE OPINION
THAT THIS WAS A GENUINE SIGHTING OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING
OBEJCT, WITH A VERY STRONG POSSIBILITY OF IT BEING THE ENTRY OF A
MET1 ORITY INTO THE EARTHS ATMOSPHERE.
