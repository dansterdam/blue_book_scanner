REPORT NO. 3-A-UFOB-2-56

COMMENTS OF FIELD OFFICERS:

1. A study of written accounts and apparent fabrication on the part of the source, and the facts that on several other occasions sources has claimed to have observed similar happenings, indicates the possibility of falsification. However, the report does not contain a detailed account of the incident to be analyzed by the intelligence personnel.

2. The value of the physical evidence is not pertinent to this case, as the witnesses did not obtain or have physical evidence that could further confirm the validity of their observation.
