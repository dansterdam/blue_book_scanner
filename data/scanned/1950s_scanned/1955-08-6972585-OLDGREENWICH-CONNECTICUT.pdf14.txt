Text from the document:

"Hopkinsville Case: This case, which has not yet been brought to the attention of the press, may cause some confusion. If understandable, it should receive the same careful investigation as any other case of this type. 

On the night of August 21, 1955, a possible identification is being considered. If authentic, it is claimed that strange figures - half human and half animal in appearance - were observed near the residence of a witness visiting from Kentucky. TV and radio broadcasters made every effort to verify the accuracy of this information, as it was reported that the witness visiting from Kentucky was an individual in whose home some strange activities had been previously described, but had not been officially without directly involving the Air Force. See attached copies of newspaper clippings (1956-1959), and the list of numerous principal persons interviewed.

The report also states that the Sheriff of the county stated that he has been reported that a native in the area stated that some creature, half human and half animal in appearance, was observed, and in the opinion of Dr. ___ Hank and the undersigned, it is possible that some members of a species ereciously unknown to science might occasionally be encountered in remote areas. The undersigned resents reading a few years ago in the New York Herald that circus owners seldom report sighting animals, until all efforts by circus crews to recapture them had failed. In many instances, the animals return on their own."
