1. The attached letter was sent to ATIC by Mr. [redacted], Hempstead Road South, Garden City South, N.Y.

2. Suggest that this letter be turned over to those persons who feel it is their duty to make certain suggestions to the Air Force.

3. Suggest that [redacted] be informed that the Air Force has no material evidence to indicate that he saw the object he reported. If there were some advanced race from another planet signaling into space to further our knowledge, if there were some advanced race from another planet signaling into space to further our knowledge, it would seem those signals would have been intercepted and some attempts made to contact them.

4. It should be pointed out to [redacted] that our investigators are obligated to collect as much scientific information as possible when investigating reports of unidentified aerial phenomena. No data would be withheld from investigation that would reveal any evidence of an increase of radiation or any unusual electrical or magnetic disturbance.
