STATEMENT:
A radio observer at the Lockheed Aircraft plant in Cathedral City, California listened to radio conversations on the USAF aircraft radio-telephone channels at approximately 5:45 am on the morning of 6 November 1957. The observer stated that the pilots of an aircraft flying over the area were discussing the fact that they were observing an unidentified aerial object. The object was described as being larger than the aircraft the pilots were flying, and it was maneuvering at a high rate of speed near their plane. The pilots discussed trying to get closer to the object to investigate it, but the object then accelerated and disappeared from view at a high rate of speed. The observer stated that the pilots appeared to be quite excited over the incident. This statement is being forwarded for information purposes.
