Mr. Lee H. Strehl
Deputy Chief
Air Intelligence Office
Detachment 122, 4709th Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

Dear Sir:

Since writing you, concerning the pot of gold, I have found that one needs a license to prospect for profit. Therefore the pot of gold will have to remain in its hiding place so far as I am concerned.
Stop in and see my legal stone collection if you are ever over this way.

Sincerely,
