First time we saw this thing was on Memorial Day at a Drive-In Theater (Sherwood) My husband and some friends that we were visiting from Cleveland was a couple of cars over from us. Apparently one straight down like a round object. It was flat and round. She said she screamed so loud that it attracted some attention at the theater.
She didn't report it because people would think she was crazy. We bothtrihg out then the Air Force was most
There weren't know thatthe thing remained inyirible. There was no end to what some friends said that they think the end time is coming. Which I assured her it wasn't.
Dayton, Ohio.
