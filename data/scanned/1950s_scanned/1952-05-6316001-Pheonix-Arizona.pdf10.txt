Subject: FLYOB?

In accordance with APL 200-2, dated 29 April 1952, subject visual flying objects observed by visual observers near Phoenix, Arizona were intervisually observed by the Airman Institute for Foreign Trends, Intelligence ARIZONA, who state the following:

On 25 May 1952, approximately 1830, various personnel stationed at the Phoenix, Arizona airport observed a number of small disc-shaped objects maneuvering silently with their discs visible near the horizon for over 12 to 15 minutes. These objects were observed by competent observers, to include tower operators at the airport, many of whom were familiar with various conventional aircraft but stated that they could not identify the objects as any known type of aircraft. Their movements were described as extremely fast and maneuverable, far exceeding the performance capabilities of any known type of aircraft. The objects were estimated to be approximately 200 miles per hour. Neither the size nor the altitude of the objects could be accurately determined. However, their general size was estimated to be between that of a piper cub and that of a C-47 aircraft. Their probable altitude was estimated at 5,000 to 10,000 feet.

The reliability of the observers is not questioned and they are considered to be competent and reliable. The object of the report observed in the Phoenix, Arizona, area, 25 May 1952, that was described and recorded as unidentified, the truth cannot be judged.
