The image contains a photograph of a delta-wing jet bomber that the text describes as having an "unusual configuration". The text provides details about the satellite developed by United States scientists, including that it is a highly-polished, 20-inch sphere to be propelled aloft by a three-stage rocket. The text also mentions that many new types of delta-wing aircraft are under development and that the unusual configuration of this aircraft lends itself to possible confusion with unidentified flying objects.

New USAF delta-wing jet bomber shows unusual configuration.
The satellite developed by United States scientists is a highly-polished, 20-inch sphere to be propelled aloft by a three-stage rocket. As planned originally it is at a height of about 300 miles and is in an elliptical orbit that will permit its sighting from positions in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Although the satellite's size will appear very minute at such an extreme altitude, its reflection will be visible to the naked eye under certain weather conditions. Its terrific speed will carry it from one horizon to the other, within the view of an observer, in less than 20 minutes.
Many new types of delta-wing aircraft are under development and some are in production at this time. Certain types are capable of vertical take-off. The unusual configuration of this aircraft lends itself to possible confusion with unidentified flying objects, and a vertical take-off might add to the observer's failure to identify it as a known object.
Analysis thus far has failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for a number of unidentified flying objects. An understanding of some of the phenomena which may cause familiar objects to assume unfamiliar characteristics, together with an awareness of the many new developments in aircraft configurations, will result in fewer sightings of this nature. Rational reporting will facilitate analysis of those sightings reported as unidentifiable.
