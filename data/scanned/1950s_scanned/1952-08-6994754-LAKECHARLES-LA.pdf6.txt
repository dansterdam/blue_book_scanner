STATEMENT OF FACT

About 2950 hours, 12 August 1952, I returned home from town with my wife. As I approached the house, I spotted a round shaped object from the front seat of my convertible with the town behind it. It was traveling from north to south at a speed twice as fast as any observable jet at about 8,000 feet. It was about 45 seconds. 15 minutes later I saw white in color, with a small cone shape behind it. The weather was very clear and the object disappeared due to the distance in the eastern maneuver, traveling straight horizontal motion.
