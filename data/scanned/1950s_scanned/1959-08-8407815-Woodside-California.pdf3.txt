Dear Major Tacker:

This letter is written in request of further information concerning an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) incident which was discussed with Capt. C. J. Ryan and Lt. Raynore of your staff at the Air Force Intelligence Command, Washington, D.C.

The caption to the UFP telephoto reads as follows:
"IDENTIFIED - An Air Force captain today said this mysterious object was not unconventional in any way. CAPT. A. BOUDWIN stated that this airship was identified as a balloon and sent aloft to measure winds. The balloon collapsed and measurements terminated abruptly."

On September 16, 1959 and again on September 30th we wrote to the PIO of the Air Technical Intelligence Center request-ing the identification data (title, model, etc.) the name of the manufacturer and one data on the instruments' capabilities. 

Since, according to the press release, the object had been positively identified and the public was assured that in seeking further details of the device the proper source to query would be the Air Force through its Public Information Channels, we assumed that the required data would be forthcoming promptly.

A privately-supported fact-finding body serving the national public interest.
