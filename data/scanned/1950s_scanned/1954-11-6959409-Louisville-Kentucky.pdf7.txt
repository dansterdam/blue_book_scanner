Mr.
Oak Ridge National Laboratories
MOMAAA, Post Office Box
Oak Ridge, Tennessee  

Dear Mr.

In reference to your personal request made to me during your recent visit, may I say that our original suspicions regarding the unidentified flying object in question have now been confirmed.

The object which you observed over Knoxville was one of two high altitude plastic experimental balloons released on the 12th and 13th of November 1954 from the University of Minnesota.

The U. S. Office of Naval Research and the University of Minnesota are presently engaged in an atmospheric experimentation research program and as a result, launch special types of balloons which are considerably larger than the average weather balloon.

Thank you for your interest in the unidentified flying object program and please feel free to contact us for any assistance you may require in the future.

Sincerely,

ALBERT W. DREPPERD
T/Sgt USAF
ATIAA-5
