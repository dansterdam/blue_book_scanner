AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: McGuire AFB, NEW JERSEY
THROUGH: MAIN AIR INTELLIGENCE SECTION, EAST DISTRICT, AIR INTELLIGENCE DIVISION 
TO: COMMANDING GENERAL, AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE CENTER, ATT: OPERATIONS ANALYSIS DIVISION
SUBJECT: Unidentified Aerial Object Seen on a Training Flight
1. On 6 December 1952, while on a training flight at approximately 13,000 feet over the Pine Barrens area of New Jersey, a flight of 4 aircraft observed a bright highly maneuverable object which appeared to be intensely luminous and was viewed by the entire flight during the time it was under observation.

2. The object, which was first observed by the pilot lead aircraft when it suddenly appeared approximately 20 degrees above the horizon at a bearing of approximately 320 degrees from the aircraft, remained in view for approximately 20 to 30 seconds. Initially it was sighted as a bright spot of light, then it changed shape and displayed considerable maneuverability, appearing to be at times elongated, circular and pulsating. At one point it appeared to be approximately three times the size of a B-36 bomber. Although the observer's initial impression was that the object was well beyond their aircraft, the rapid maneuvers and changes in apparent size suggested that the object was in fact comparatively close. No vapor trail or exhaust emission was observed at any time.

3. All observing was done visually and with radar contact was lost at the termination of the sighting. 

4. The pilot was at approximately 13,000 feet and 10 miles west of a heading of 330 degrees from the McGuire Air Force Base when the sighting occurred. The object was observed to be flying at a heading of approximately 220 degrees at a speed estimated to be in excess of 600 knots. The object was apparently level with the aircraft and this altitude was maintained for 20 to 30 seconds. It then climbed rapidly to an altitude estimated to be 35,000 feet and headed in a southeasterly direction, disappearing from view in approximately 60 seconds.

5. There were no activities meteorological or otherwise that could have accounted for the sighting and there was no physical evidence to substantiate the claim that an unidentified object was present, other than the reports by the pilots involved.
