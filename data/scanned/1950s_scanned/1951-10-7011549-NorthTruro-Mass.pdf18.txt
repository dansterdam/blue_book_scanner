1.  In compliance with AMC Letter 200-1, dated 11 April 1951, Subject: Reporting of Information on Unconventional Aircraft, the following report is submitted.

a. Manner of observation: Radar pickup on Plan Position Indicator of CPS-6B radar at North Truro, Massachusetts.

b. Time and place of sighting: 1200Z to 1222Z, 22 October 1951, from 6805N - 45*05'W to 70*05'W - 42*01'N.

c. Location of observer (CPS-6B radar): 70*03'W - 42*01'N.

d. Length of time object was observed: Two (2) minutes.

e. Number of objects: One; course: West, then South; altitude unknown; speed: 2400 knots.

f. Weather conditions at time of sighting: Clouds - 11/00; scattered; visibility - 15 miles; temperature - 42Â°.

g. Radar frequency: 2992 and 5014 megacycles.

2. The individual echo returns and the appearance of the track substantiated the probability of these radar pickings actually being of a flying object rather than some kind of radar interference or malfunction.

The amplitude of the return varied from pickup to pickup and was never appreciably strong, both of which are characteristic of any aircraft radar return. When the tracks turned
