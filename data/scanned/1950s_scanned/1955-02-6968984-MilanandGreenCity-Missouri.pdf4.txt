TEXT OUTPUT:

SUBJECT: Sighting of Unidentified Object and Report on Investigation

On the 14 of February, 1956 at 1715 GMT (23.15Z) William Springett, a civilian, was driving north on State Highway 5, 9 miles north of Milan, Missouri, when he sighted an object which appeared to be hovering in the air at a very high altitude. His attention was attracted to the object by a brilliant flash of light coming from the direction of it. A better view was obtained as the object approached nearer. The witness stated that the object was round in shape, appeared to be silvery in color, and was much larger than a conventional aircraft at that distance. No noise was heard. After observing the object for several minutes, it suddenly accelerated at a tremendous speed and disappeared from sight within a matter of seconds.

The distance between the two sightings was approximately 3-5 miles. It is the opinion of the investigating team that the object seen was not one of the balloons (weather) normally used.
