AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Major Gray's report on 12 December 1952 while flying straight and level at 30,000 ft. as number two man in a two ship formation (C-45) sighted an unidentified object at 11 o'clock position about 5 miles away. The object appeared to be a silver, disc-shaped object and was observed for approximately 1.5 to 2 minutes. It appeared to be closing on the aircraft and suddenly made a sharp climbing turn and disappeared from sight. The sighting was reported to be similar to a previous formation on 10 December 1952 when a similar object was observed.
It was determined that the object was not a meteorological phenomenon and it did not observe it. The sighting was witnessed by the two pilots and it was brought to the attention of the flight leader, but he did not observe it. It was about that time that winds aloft at this time were reported at 3500 at 75 knots.
