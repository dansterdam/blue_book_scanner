Garreston, S.D.
Oct 6, 1959
SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Objects
1. On 5 October 1959, this office received a report from Mr. H.L. Garreston, a farmer residing 5 miles southwest of Garreston, S.D. that he had observed an unidentified flying object in the sky on the evening of 4 October 1959.
2. Mr. Garreston stated that at approximately 7:00 PM on 4 October 1959, while feeding livestock, he observed a bright light in the sky, appearing at first to be approximately 20 feet in diameter and 30 feet above the ground. As he watched the object, it began to increase in size, finally reaching an estimated 40 feet in diameter and hovering at an estimated 50 feet above the ground. He stated that the object appeared to be a round, solid, metallic object, with no visible means of propulsion. He further stated that the object was illuminated from the inside, giving off a bright glow.
3. Mr. Garreston stated that he observed the object for approximately 5 minutes, during which time it did not move from its hovering position. He then stated that the object suddenly shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed and disappeared from view.
4. No other witnesses were located who could confirm Mr. Garreston's report. No evidence of the object was found at the site.
