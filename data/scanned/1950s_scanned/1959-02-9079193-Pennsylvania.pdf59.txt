DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY 

24 June 1959

Dear Mr. _____,

This is to acknowledge your letter of 15 June 1959 concerning your inquiry about newspaper articles on this sighting. 

The 1957 York Herald Tribune articles of 1 March 1959 concerning this sighting were factual and this office considered it accurate and authentic. Your interpretation of the information or your theories as to their significance are matters for your own evaluation.

However, the flying object seen remains unidentified, and basic observations and findings in the case have been corrected or supplemented from time to time. Any additional clarification will be a matter for future consideration or investigation in accordance with the progress of aerial observation developments.

Answering your other questions, the following information is provided:

The Air Force received a large number of reports from the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development. This case was one of many which was investigated and evaluated. Case files, interviews, and other information were assembled and conclusions drawn as to the nature of the sighting, although no positive identification could be made.

The statement you received was compiled during May 1959. The conclusions in your case were reviewed at that time and no further evidence was obtained for the specific items you mentioned.
