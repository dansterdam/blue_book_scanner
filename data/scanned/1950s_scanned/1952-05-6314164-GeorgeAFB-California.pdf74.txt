I. REPORT OF OCCURRENCE:
On 3 May 1952 at about 2300 hours, local time, a Capt. L. Hoover, navigator at George AFB, Victorville, California, observed an unidentified flying object on that date.

2. I was at the time in my car on the flight line of the base airport, looking at the stars, when I noticed an object moving rapidly across the sky from southwest to northeast. It appeared to be about 40 feet long and approximately 8 feet wide, and to be traveling at a very high rate of speed, estimated at 500 to 700 mph.

3. I watched the object for about 15 seconds as it crossed the entire sky, and then it disappeared from view. It made no sound and left no trail. I could not estimate the altitude, but it appeared to be at a high altitude.

4. I do not know what the object was, but it was definitely not an aircraft, balloon, or any other identifiable object that I have ever seen. I am certain that it was an unidentified flying object.

5. I am the only witness of this occurrence.

6. None.

7. None.

8. None.

9. None.
