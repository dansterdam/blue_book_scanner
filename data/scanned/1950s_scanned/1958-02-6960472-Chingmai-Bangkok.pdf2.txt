Due to the circumstances which were reported, the woodsmen were given a sum of money to hunt for the object. A group of reporters and intelligence officials later went to the scene. They were unable to find any trace of the object, and some of the search party were negative in their accounts. Several others did not all say the same thing, however, and the object was very low and bright.

Summary Comment:
From the several reliable eyewitnesses interviewed, apparently some object was sighted in the sky. Indications pointed by both French Priest and the American Airmen in Chiang Mai are questionable, since the object is supposed to have remained stationary for a period of at least 2 to 4 minutes and only later was observed to have moved very rapidly. The Americans reportedly observed a reddish object at 9:15 P.M., February 17, 1958. The details of their search and the results of it are not known. A limited search of the area was made by Thai police helicopter. No further action is being taken by the Consulate.
