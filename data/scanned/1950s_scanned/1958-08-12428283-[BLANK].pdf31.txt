There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. This appears to be a typed text document from Project Blue Book, likely an excerpt or summary of the project's activities and findings.

Text Extracted:

First, misinterpretation of conventional objects such as aircraft, balloons, astronomical bodies, also atmospheric phenomena, radar malfunctions and anomalies, etc.

4. In December 1949, these findings were released to the public by the Department of Defense and were given wide publicity by the press. 

5. From February 1949 to mid-1951 the project was carried on a low priority basis due to the economy policy of that time. However, in late 1951 renewed public interest and an increase in the number of sightings were reported. This increase in activity was due to the emphasis placed on UFO's by the press and publicity, and possibly due to the Ground Observer Corps program. In the summer of 1951 the project was again reviewed and "Project BLUE BOOK" established to handle UFO reports.
