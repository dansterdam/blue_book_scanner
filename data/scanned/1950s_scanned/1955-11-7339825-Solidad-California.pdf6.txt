ORIGINATING AGENCY Det 1, 4602d AISS REPORT NO. D1-UPON-2-55 PART THREE PAGE 11

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
a. It is the opinion of the Preparing Officer, this sighting was probably caused by the planet Jupiter, for the following reasons:
b. No other identification criteria are consonant with the reported facts of the sighting.
c. The planet Jupiter, bright and white in color, rose approximately 15 minutes after the reported sighting. Although the reported shape and size are unusual, for a planet 16 degrees above the horizon the DISTANCE and ASPECT would be such as to produce the description given.
d. In movement (East to West), the rainbow variations described are in exact accord with the motion of this planet as it moved across the sky.
e. Although the SOURCES claimed to have seen two objects, the fact that the distance which separated the two objects varied, and at times almost merged, plus the fact that the two objects always remained to the east, are consonant observations usually associated with the planet Jupiter, which has been an optical illusion.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sighting was probably caused by the planet Jupiter.
