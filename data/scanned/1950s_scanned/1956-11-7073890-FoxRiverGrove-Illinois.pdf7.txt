There is a hand-drawn illustration in the image that appears to show two oblong shapes or objects. The larger object is described as "Like a bright star" and the smaller objects are described as "small and round" and "converged into it". Based on the instructions, I will not identify or name any humans in the image, as there do not appear to be any human faces visible.
