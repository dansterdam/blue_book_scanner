Los Angeles 25, Calif.
March 11, 1958

Captain Wallace G. Hartny, USAF
Assistant Chief, Armament Division
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense
Washington 25, D.C.

Dear Captain Hartny:

THANK YOU FOR YOUR CORDIAL AND INFORMATIVE COMMUNICATION OF 28 FEBRUARY, 1958. YOUR CONTINUED COOPERATION - AND PATIENCE - IS APPRECIATED.

TO MY PROJECT DOESSANTARY PROBLEMS, HOWEVER, THE POSITION REMAINS THAT OF THE LAST REPORT, NAMELY: THE LACK OF TIME AND SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON WHICH TO ACT. AS REPEATED BEFORE, CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SEEM TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THIS MATTER. AS FORMULATED IN DETAIL BY CAPTAIN EDWARNS - AS RETURNED TO YOU WITHOUT REQUEST - THIS WILL DEPEND PRECISELY ON WHAT IS ULTIMATELY SUBMITTED.

SO YOU CAN SEE THAT I AM IN A RATHER NERVOUS POSITION AT THE MOMENT, AND I WONDER IF YOU WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO TELL ME JUST WHAT TO DO.

THERE IS ANOTHER POINT THAT I WISH YOU WOULD CLARIFY - WITH RESPECT TO THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT MENTIONED. WHAT IS THE SPECIFIC FOOTAGE THAT YOU HAVE REQUESTED. I HOPE YOU WILL RESPOND. THE SPECIFIC FOOTAGE THAT I HAVE WILL DEPEND UPON SOME DEFINITE INFORMATION FROM YOU.

THIS REPLY HAS BEEN A BIT HURRIED. ONE OF THE FILMS ABOUT WHICH I WROTE TO CAPTAIN EDWARDS HAS, CALIF., ON MAY 6, 1957 AND I HAVE A LETTER FROM HIM REGARDING SAME IN SOME DETAIL.

I BELIEVE THE GUN-CAMERA ACTION THAT MAJOR WRIGHT-PATTERSON ARE ON 30 AUGUST 1957 TO BE CONCLUSIVE FOR A PERIOD OF 3 TO 5 MINUTES. AND I HAVE CONSIDERABLE DETAIL ON THIS, CONFIRMED BY SEVERAL SOURCES - OBSERVATIONS BY GROUND WATCHERS IN THE AREA, RADAR TRACK, VISUAL CONTACT, ETC. YOUR LETTER OF FEBRUARY 28 DOES NOT MENTION THIS POINT AND I WONDER IF YOU ARE AWARE OF IT.

AND THE WHITE SANDS CINEMATOGRAPHIC FILMS REFERRED TO BY GENERAL RAMSEY IN THEIR O.S.I. COMMAND LIAISON LETTER OF DECEMBER 5, 1956, WILL VERIFY WHAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED.

AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION IN THIS MATTER.

Sincerely,
