Transcription of the text:

What she thought it seemed to dip about 3 yds. up at times. It was drifting, or moving very slowly, and went from east to west, approximately a distance of 3/4 mile. It stayed in the sky for about 15 min and moved forward, did not cross path, but kept same direction at a slow speed. It was a weird shape, rather oval in form, and grey in color. The distance of the object was estimated to be from 1 to 2 miles. At about 3:50 p.m., where we had been informed a certain star was, nothing was visible. The sky was clear, visible for a great distance, and the temperature was mild. It seemed to have a slight haze around it, as the moon when rising, and stayed about the same area, did not drift up or down, but seemed to go straight forward, slanting slightly from east to west. Could this be the planet Venus, or some other celestial body, or was it a genuine unidentified flying object? On the Western horizon, there were a few scattered, high cirro stratus clouds, but they were thin and filmy, and the sky was otherwise clear.
