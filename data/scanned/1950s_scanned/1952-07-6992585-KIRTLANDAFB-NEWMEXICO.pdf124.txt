2. The witnesses were seated on a porch in Sunland, California, watching planes arriving at Burbank, California, when they saw an intense white-blue light in a cloud to the north northwest. The light burned for about seven seconds. Both witnesses then saw a saucer shaped object approach southeast overhead at the same time and almost the same in altitude but at a speed which appeared faster than that of a commercial DC-6 still in the vicinity of the airport. The object had a wobbly sort of motion and a saucer like shape. It turned to the right, following the path of approaching aircraft and disappeared behind the hills. The witness is a Douglas engineer and states the object appeared at least as large if not larger than a DC-6.
