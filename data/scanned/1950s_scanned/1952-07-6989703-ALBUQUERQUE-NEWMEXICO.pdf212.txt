SUBJECT: (UNCL) FLYOBX

Albuquerque, New Mexico

In reference to your flyobject of 7 July 52, the following data is recorded to establish velocity:

For what duration did the unidentified flying object appear on the GCI scope? Could GCI operators determine blip size or target altitude?

The GCI scope operators who originally estimated the fly-ing object's velocity stated the object appeared to move extremely fast and traveled in a straight line and that they pressed the speed as the object was tracked onto the target.

If so, were the operators able to measure the acceleration? What was the apparent acceleration of the object?

Since the object was visually observed, what was the apparent size and apparent luminosity of the object? How did it compare with known objects in the sky at the time, such as stars or planets?

Were there any releases of any balloons in the Roswell area around the time of this incident? If so, can exact time and tracks of such releases be established as well as the initial size and trail of the balloon-carried object?
