2. Under paragraph (b), the following is submitted:
a. Same as remarks a, b, c and d above.
b. Clear with good visibility at 15,000 feet where contact was obtained.
c. Momentary contact was made, but not enough of a trace or pattern observed to be able to determine its character.
d. No OCT was attempted due to the limitations explained in 1 above.
3. Evaluation of the appearance of the radar pip plus the visual sighting involved a jet type aircraft of the appearance indicated and carrying lights. This was confirmed by subsequent OCT to find the identity of the flight. The altitude of the flight was well within the 12,000 to 14,000 feet range, the lights on an aircraft, passing through the airspace warning area.
