June 27, 1958

Dr. Francis Arcier
ATIC
Wright Patterson Airforce Base
Ohio

Dear Dr. Arcier:

Perhaps you will remember me as being the only woman who was present at the briefing in which you participated on June 20, in the office of Congressman John E. Henderson of Ohio. I was there representing Congressman Tollefson who was out of town.

You will find enclosed photostatic copies of two articles which appeared in the Washington News & Sunday Radar. These give the details regarding the incident to which the briefing session pertained.

The Article which appeared August 20, 1950, was printed the day following the one was - when I wrote the article which you appended a letter.

You very kindly offered to look back in the files and try to determine for me what it is you recall and/or explanation the Airforce has on this incident. I shall be looking forward to hearing from you on this matter.

Sincerely yours,
