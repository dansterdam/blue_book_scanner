"STATEMENT

I, Mrs. Marcelle L. Adair, residing at King Salmon, Alaska make the following statement:

During the evening of 6 February 1953 at approximately 10:30 p.m. Alaska Standard Time, I observed a strange object in the sky west of my home. The light was a reddish-orange when I first observed it, and it changed to a whitish-orange, then to a bluish-white as it moved slowly overhead. The light appeared to be about 10-12 feet in diameter and about 25 feet above the ground. There was no sound and it did not appear to rotate or vibrate. The light was visible for about 10 minutes and then it disappeared. This is a true and correct statement to the best of my knowledge.

/s/ Mrs. Marcelle L. Adair
King Salmon"
