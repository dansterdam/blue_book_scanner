Consideration of figure 7 and application of the law of cosines together with trigonometric manipulation yields:
tan h = tan ho / (1 + 2t sin bo + t^2)^1/2  (1)
cos β = (1 + t sin bo) / (1 + 2t sin bo + t^2)^1/2  (2)
ωo = (1 + 2t sin bo + t^2) / (1 + t sin bo)  (3)
In the example at hand, the total elapsed time of observation is on the order of 15 seconds and the angular sweep of the objects across the sky (β) is about 20°. Thus
0 < t < 0.3
Using equations (1), (2) and (3) the dashed lines depicting theoretical azimuth headings (figure 5a and 5b) are computed.
There does exist a random error (attributed to errors in measurement or slight variations of the UFO's motion) about the theoretical line that makes it impossible to determine a precise plot and establish plot and establish a detailed pattern. Furthermore, since the angular sweep and the visual observations are over a relatively short interval, the normal points could at most mask a variation in distance, altitude or separation of the two. In particular, there is a slight variation in both plots (figures 1:25 to 175) towards the 169° azimuth heading. However, the general accuracy of the pointing to maintain the same angular direction on the plot indicates that this slight variation doesn't represent a variation in direction, but rather represents a variation in distance, possibly a variation in the targets to the curve's would lie somewhere between 169° and 173° azimuth heading.
