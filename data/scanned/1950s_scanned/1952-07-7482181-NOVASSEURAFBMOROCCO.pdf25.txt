2300 hours while sitting in his automobile at an outdoor theater north of Mouasseur, Morocco, the witness observed several objects in the sky. The objects appeared to be on a fixed course moving from south to north and appeared to be about 500 feet and moving at a very rapid rate. Three objects took several minutes to pass overhead. The witness stated that the objects seemed to be controlled by some external means and that their paths were erratic with sudden stops and changes in direction. The witness could not determine the exact nature or size of the objects, but he said that the flame and light end trailing behind the objects were several smaller solid or flame objects that appeared to be under the control of the main objects. The witness estimated that the objects were about 500 feet in diameter and were varying greatly in speed, some objects or direction of flight. The witness considered the experience unusual but was unable to draw any conclusions as to the exact nature of the objects.
