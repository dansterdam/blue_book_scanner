New Sky Mystery Seen As Guessing Continues
Coast Guard Says Brilliant Light Flying Over Gulf of Mexico At High Speed

WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 - (AP) - A brilliant mystery object was reported hurtling across the sky over the Gulf of Mexico at high speed and higher altitude Wednesday night.

The Coast Guard said the object was seen by four men aboard the Coast Guard cutter Blackthorn. It was reported as a brilliant light traveling at a high rate of speed at an estimated altitude of about 20,000 feet.

The Coast Guard said the object was seen for about 25 seconds.

Sightings of strange objects in that area have been reported to the Air Force and other military officials, but the Air Force said it had no additional information on this latest sighting.

The Air Force said the radar station at Chase Field, Beeville, Tex., reported no unusual activity during the time the object was seen.

The message said the object was observed by qualified investigators and was very bright, it was a brilliant white light that was smaller than a star, and traveled at a high rate of speed, the Air Force said.

The Air Force said it had checked all reports of unidentified flying objects and "found nothing to indicate that this was anything other than an astronomical phenomena."

It said astronomers and experts in the Air Force will evaluate the current sightings to determine if they are significant enough to warrant further investigation.

The Coast Guard said the four men aboard the Blackthorn, which was on routine patrol, were confident the object was not an airplane or other familiar craft.
