The image does not contain any photograph, but rather a page from a UFO report document. The page is filled with text and diagrams, but no actual photograph is present.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand?
(Circle One:)
a. Pea
b. Shot
c. Dime
d. Nickel
e. Half dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22): 
a. Not very sure
b. Fairly certain
c. Very sure
d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that we can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could interview the object that you saw. Of what type material would you say it was made? How large would it be, and what shape? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.

The shape from the diagram in question 20 appears to be a sketch of a curved path with an "A" at the beginning and a "B" at the end, indicating changes in direction during the object's movement.

The text answers the various questions about the size, comparison to known objects, certainty of the witness, the disappearance of the object, and a description of what the witness imagines the object to be made of and its size and shape.
