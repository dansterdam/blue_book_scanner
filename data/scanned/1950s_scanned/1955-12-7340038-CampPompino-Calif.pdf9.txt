GIST of Preparing Officer:
1. In the opinion of the preparing officer, this sighting was probably caused by an unknown planet shining through a thin layer of clouds, giving it a distorted effect. (Some clouds were reported by Dr. Officer of the USAF Observatory.)
2. The star Ceres also fits the circumstances of this case; however, since its movement is in the wrong direction, from the southeast diagonally toward the northeast, the direction becomes reversed from that of Ceres' sighting.
3. Inasmuch as no astronomical reason existed for this sighting, and no balloon or aircraft control devices could be located, the conclusion drawn is that it was probably caused by a natural atmospheric phenomenon, possibly a mirage, causing the view to become distorted.

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that the sighting was astronomical in nature and was probably caused by the star Betelgeuse rather than an unknown planet.
