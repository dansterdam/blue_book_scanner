The image contains a photograph of what appears to be a UFO report document from Project Blue Book. However, since the image contains a human face, I will not identify or name any individuals in the image, but instead describe it as I would if I could not identify the humans.

The document appears to be a "SUMMARY OF INFORMATION" report dated January 9, 1951. It describes an "unidentified object" observed in the sky, characterized as a "bright sliver of light, one half size of a flattened new moon sighted at 1923:10z November by Major Object." The report provides details about the object's movements and disappearance, as well as observations made by a pilot from the 153rd Fighter Squadron, Mississippi Air National Guard.

Turning to the text in the document, the OCR output is as follows:
