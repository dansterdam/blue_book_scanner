The image on the page contains three sketches or illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved line representing the path of an object that was above the horizon when first observed, and the viewer's perspective of how high the object was above the horizon. The second and third sketches appear to be different views or perspectives of a similar object or scene, with one sketch showing a larger, more detailed view and the other showing a smaller, more simplified view.

32. In the following sketch show how the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
