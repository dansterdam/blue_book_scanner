3 June 1954

Mr. [Redacted]
[Redacted], Pennsylvania

Dear Mr. [Redacted],

In reply to your letter of May 19, 1954, I wish to commend you for your interest concerning the alleged unidentified object you and your wife observed in the sky.

I have no doubts of your being sound of mind, and I shall answer your questions concerning the above-mentioned sighting. As to whether or not such "so-called aircraft" do not make violent movements such as the object you saw, I must say that aircraft do not make violent movements as the object would suggest was a rather weather balloon or some other weather device used in recording wind aloft and other data that is necessary prior to undertaking the global all-weather forecast that we have in being today.

Your home location on the ridges surrounding Reading, Pennsylvania, also would preclude any military aircraft operating in the area. Also, I might add that weather balloons have been known to travel in excess of 200 miles per hour. Due to the tremendous ground-speed resulting, Pennsylvania.

I would like to say in closing that I do not believe you saw a flying saucer; however, I again wish to commend you for your alertness. I hope I have given you a reasonable answer to your questions.

Very truly yours,

s/ CLARK E. VAN EPPS
Major, USAF
Operations Staff Officer
