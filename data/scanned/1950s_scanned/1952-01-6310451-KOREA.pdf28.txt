SUMMARY
1. Observed one globe shaped object with a slight tear drop effect noted on lower side, estimated size to be three feet across when at its nearest point to B-29. The size was not definitely established as the distance from the observer was not known. The color of the object resembled the sun, a light orange, and it occasionally changed to a bluish tint. The outer edge of the object appeared to be fuzzy and it seemed to have an internal churning movement like flames or fiery gases when it was at its nearest point to B-29. The object was first observed parallel on course at eight o'clock level, where it seemed to be about the size of a saucer, gradually becoming larger as it approached the B-29. It came in on the same level as the B-29 and remained in the same relative position to the B-29 for approximately one minute and then proceeded on the same path, fading away in the distance.

2. Sighted on January 29, 1952 for a period of approximately one minute. The left Gunner and Tail Gunner observed the object without the use of any optical or electronic equipment. The B-29 was at 22,250 feet, and ground speed 125 knots.

3. The two observers were airborne in the B-29 in the crew positions of Left Gunner and Tail Gunner. Object was observed at 3926N 12555E and level with the B-29.
