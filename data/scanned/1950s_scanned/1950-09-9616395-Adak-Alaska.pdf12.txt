Subject: Four Photographic Negatives, showing images of the Sun in partial eclipse and in addition, unidentified images.

1. The enclosed subject negatives were exposed under the following conditions:
    a) Camera; 4 x 5 Speed Graphic
    b) Lens: Kodak Ektar, COATED, f. 4.7 127mm
    c) Film: Kodak Super-XX, film pack
    d) Filter: Wratten “A”
    e) Exposure; 1/100 sec. at f. 22
    f) Place; from the weather deck of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter NORTHWIND in the Bering Sea about 40 miles north of Adak in the Aleutian Islands
    g) Time: About 1600 hours in zone "plus eleven"
    h) Date: Total Eclipse of the Sun in the summer of 1950, whose path of totality crossed the Aleutian Islands near Adak Alaska
    i) Developed: 6 July, 1952 in Kodak Microdol, 15 mins at 76°

2. These negatives bear the pack sequence numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 and when viewed with the clipped corner held to the lower left, the eclipse images were exposed from left to right and from top to bottom, at fairly uniform intervals of approximately 50 seconds each.

3. It is apparent that the unidentified images to the right of the eclipse images are all of the same object, but vary in size, shape, attitude, altitude and distance from the eclipse image in each case. The possibility that they have some simple explanation in optics or meteorology has been considered carefully and in view of the inconsistencies mentioned were deemed worthy of being forwarded for expert scrutiny.
