10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
   Seven objects, round white, size of 
   dime at arms length, seen seperately
   at regular intervals for two minutes
   Lights observed. The objects were
   very high.

11. COMMENTS
   Scattered high clouds. Five B-47's
   in area on photo mission. This
   sighiting was undoubtedly genera-
   ted by the aforementioned B-47's
   The scattered clouds would give
   the impression of more than five
   aircraft.
