2. The following was reported by Los Alamos, New Mexico:
"Approximately 1100 hours (MST), 29 July 1952, I sighted an object in the sky travelling in a westerly direction. The object was estimated was altitude 7,000 above the horizon. The distance of the object could not be determined. The object appeared egg-shaped and dark in color. Considered the size of a large commercial aircraft. The object moved rapidly and disappeared from view in an easterly direction behind Bald Mountain. The time sighted behind Bald Mountain was uncertain because of the determined location due to the distance. The size of the object could not be determined because of the distance."

3. The following was reported by telephone installer at Los Alamos, New Mexico:
"At 1057 hours (MST), 29 July 1952, at the Security Station G-10, I observed an object appearing egg-shaped in structure, directly overhead. The distance I was unable to determine, but when first sighted and appeared to have wings. The object continued this oscillating or gyrating motion to descending motion as it began to move, then the wings disappeared. The object had no color and appeared light brown in color as it began to move. The object then disappeared from view. I was unable to determine whether the object disappeared behind the horizon, or simply blinked out."
