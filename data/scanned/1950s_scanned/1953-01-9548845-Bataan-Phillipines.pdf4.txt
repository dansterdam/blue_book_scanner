AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
35-93
STATEMENT OF M. COLONEL . . .
CUSTOMS SOURCE AND HARBOR POLICE, MANILA, PHILIPPINE ISLANDS

On the evening of 27 December, 1952 while the U.S.S. General A. W. Brewster was lying in Bataan Province waters near Olongapo, Philippine Islands, several persons observed four (4) unknown lights in the sky. These lights were sighted by the Commanding Officer, the Customs Guard, and the Harbor Police and appeared to be hovering and maneuvering over the vessel. After approximately 30 to 40 minutes the lights disappeared. This incident was reported to my headquarters and to the local authorities.

The night was clear with a full moon. There was no wind and the sea was calm. According to the Customs Guard and Harbor Police, the lights were about thirty thousand (30,000) to thirty-five thousand (35,000) feet in altitude.

I have not divulged this information to any unauthorized individuals and have instructed those concerned to avoid public discussions of the incident. However, I decided to relate what facts I have to your investigation upon the request of your representative.

I have read the foregoing statement consisting of one page and have initialed all corrections. This statement is the truth to the best of my knowledge and belief.

/s/ Paul A. Harkins 
Colonel, GSC

Subscribed and sworn to before me this 10th day of February 1953.
