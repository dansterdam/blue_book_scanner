I SAW A FLYING SAUCER

The following is in answer to your request for any information concerning any UFO sightings in your area. I would like to report that on November 26, 1957, at approximately 6:15 p.m. (CST) near the Allison Engineering plant in Indianapolis, Indiana, I and two other employees of the Allison Engineering plant were driving home from work when we observed what appeared to be a flying saucer.

The object was first sighted slightly to the south of us and appeared to be stationary. It was clear but a few minutes elapsed when we observed it moving in a northerly direction, gaining speed as it went. The object was a silver-gray color and appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet. It moved in a straight line and seemed to wobble slightly as it gained speed. The entire episode lasted less than a minute. 

As the object gained speed, it seemed to move away from us. When it was approximately a mile away, it seemed to accelerate in speed tremendously and faded from view. The entire sighting lasted approximately 45 seconds to a minute.

I would appreciate any information your office can provide on this incident as I am very interested in this type of phenomenon. All are other personnel who witnessed this sighting concur with my description of the object. I realize you probably receive many reports of this nature, but I felt it was my duty to report this incident to your office.
