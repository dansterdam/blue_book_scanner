The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from a document related to a report of a strange object sighting in the sky.

Report of a strange object rising in the sky at 1:05 A.M. on. Sunday, September 13, 1959 between Bay and Giles Streets, southeast of Gila Rock, Wisconsin.

I had planned on going fishing in the morning, and at this early hour I was picking night-crawlers. Suddenly there was a loud noise that immediately made me think of a jet plane in flight, quite low to the ground. One difference in the noise was that this noise was pulsating, and seemed like it was rather close to the field. After 2 or 3 minutes, I noticed the strange object in the sky, rising at a terrific speed, straight up, rising higher and higher until it looked like a star. However, when I first noticed the object, the base seemed round with yellowish light, with eight blue lights on the outside, and five red lights located in the center. There and all the while it was making a low humming sound like the blue lights. No exhaust or jet stream could be seen. It took approximately ten minutes time for all this to happen. Neither my wife nor myself heard the noise while in the house. Neither noticed out of the window to see what caused the noise. However, she was on the wrong side of the house and consequently could not see anything. The sky was clear. When I outside the house, I was amazed at what I saw and heard something strange that I wish someone would explain.

August 14, 1959.
