First noticed object because of its shape and our inability to
figure what it could be. Suddenly realized there were four or
five (possibly round) objects, and while coming, they were
on the face they were evenly spaced saw them; they were
watching movement of them was rapid and erratic, keeping
their shape, that is, no turning, tumbling or anything; we
had over seen them. The two planes were in the sky at the time,
but were too distant for us to discern whether they were
watching the objects or not.  Nothing plane gave any indication of anything unusual occurring at the time.

20. Do not feel at all qualified to estimate distance or speed.
However, the objects appeared to be below the horizon, in front of
the mountains - perhaps 10-12 miles distant. 

22 -- These objects remained at about the same height, and from
our position appeared to be below the horizon, in front of
the mountains. When the objects first came into view we
were no longer able to see them through the back window.
At the same time they disappeared from our view.

27. At the time they were observed, it appeared unusual, resembling
something never seen before, having a speed, anything like it, though we
estimated they moved faster than sight. As we returned the same spot on
July 10th on our way home we remembered having seen a U.F.0. in an
El Paso paper, having seen the photographs at Alamagordo and
seen a so-called flying saucer the same day we had visited
Holloman Air Force Base and were on our way home, we assumed
what we saw was not unusual in that locality and it was not
until we returned home that we thought it sufficiently important to report.
