The image contains three sketches or illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved line and a silhouetted landscape, with the instructions to mark "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when first seen, and "B" to show how high the object was above the horizon when you last saw it.

The second and third sketches appear to be examples of how to complete the larger sketch, showing a road with trees and mountains in the background, and a road going off into the distance with a curved horizon line above.
