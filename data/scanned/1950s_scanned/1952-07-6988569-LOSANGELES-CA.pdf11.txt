REPORT OF SIGHTING

Date - July 29th, 1952
Time - First seen about 11:01 p.m. EST. Last seen about 11:15 p.m. EST. when it moved out of sight.
Place - First seen over Mt. Hope, just behind town on the horizon.
Observers - M.S. and D.D. reporting.
Description of Object - They consisted of two (2) very compact, round, luminous objects, high up. They were a pale blue-green in color and seemed to be about the size of a dime at arm's length. There was a slight haze around the object. Their path was in a generally straight course.
Estimated Altitude - Between one and two thousand feet.
Estimated Speed - Apparently they gave the appearance of traveling at about 500 to 700 mph.
Estimated Distance - Three to four miles.
Estimated Duration - About 14 minutes.
Remarks - No smoke trail or light rays were otherwise visible as the lights. Their path was a straight course up-drafts and down-drafts. My oldest son made this observation which corroborated my own visual perception.
There were no red port lights visible which should have been the case if they were piloted craft.
The intensity of these two lights did not change which they would definitely have done had they been regular navigation lights on two aircraft traveling through the air.
Atmospheric Conditions - Slight hazy at the ceiling estimated at 1,000 feet. Sky - clear, with no moon.
