The image contains a handwritten document with text and a small sketch-like drawing in the lower portion of the frame. The drawing appears to depict some kind of aerial or celestial object.

Here is the text contained in the document:

WHEREAS this writing contains year-old data, certain important details and conclusions I have formed from it may be as valid and pertinent today as when first written. This writing has lain dormant too long unnoticed. So at this late date, I finally can no longer contain it to myself but feel it is 11 the time to place it in the hands of proper authority for consideration. This incident first came to my attention through a former employee of mine who was directly involved in its early stages. I am convinced of the sincerity and integrity of this individual, and consider the facts herein to be essentially reliable and worthy of investigation.

The essence of the matter is this: On the evening of (date), while on a routine boat run from North Bend, Oregon to Coos Bay, Oregon, my former employee and several others observed a strange aerial phenomenon which defied all natural explanation. What they saw was a brilliantly lighted, disc-shaped object which hovered briefly over the boat, maneuvered at incredible speeds, and then disappeared from sight. For this reason, I feel this incident should be made a matter of official record with the proper authorities. I am convinced that the facts presented herein warrant further investigation.
