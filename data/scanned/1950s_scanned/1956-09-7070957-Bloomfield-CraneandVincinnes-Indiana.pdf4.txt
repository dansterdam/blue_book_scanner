The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official United States Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

OC 17 September 1956 at 1900 Central Standard Time. They reported seeing two objects approximately three miles high over the northeast section of the town. They could have been objects of bright light which turned red and appeared to have changed course frequently and at times stood still, that to the witnesses appeared larger than jets at that altitude. They reported hearing no sound and concluded after viewing the objects for approximately twenty minutes that they were unidentified.

2. Enclosure (1) was prepared from a description of aircraft in the area at the time of the incident. The description was given by the witness. The description indicates that the objects were seen at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet.

3. This report was prepared by the Legal Officer attached to the case, whose comments and preliminary analysis of possible causes is as follows:

The red lights reported over the target by the witness since the witnesses had no reports of any transports passing through the area, nor was there any jet activity in the vicinity of the target. If it is just as they say the transports, the contrast between the speed and turning characteristics of the objects must have been exceptional. This makes interpretation difficult.
