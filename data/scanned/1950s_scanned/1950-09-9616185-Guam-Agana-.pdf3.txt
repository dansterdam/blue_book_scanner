RE: UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT OVER GUAM SEPTEMBER 12, 1950:
DAVID HUGH S. BENNETT - USAF INFORMANT

Dear Colonel Farrell:

My letter dated January 21, 1950, advised you I had some information to report. This information is now being forwarded. I advised an agent of this office that in September, 1950 near Agana, Guam, he observed an unidentified object flying over the shore of this island. He stated it appeared to be a disc, and about 600 feet in the air, and no sound was heard. The object was luminous and about a mile from the observer. He stated that a white cloud covered part of the object and he watched it disappear in the cloud. He stated he does not know whether the cloud formed from the flying object or whether the cloud was already there.

Furnished herewith is a sketch drawn up on March 13, 1950, while awaiting an interview with the FBI representative."
