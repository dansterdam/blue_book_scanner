PROJECT 10073 RECORD CARD
1. DATE: 23 August 1956
2. LOCATION: Dallas, Texas
3. DASS-TIME GROUP: 2350
5. PHOTOS: D, yes, several
7. LENGTH OF OBSERVATION: 3-5 min
10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Two apparent-ly real sky objects appeared to be moving slowly at a considerable distance, with some changes in brightness and position. The objects appeared to be round in shape and did not blink or flash. They moved in straight lines, slowly and apparently level. No sound was heard.
11. COMMENTS: The astro charts b and 1 indicate the 'objects' were probably star(s). However, the observed movements and variation(s) in brightness do not correspond to normal stellar activity. The objects were at a considerable distance and moved slowly but erratically and with no blinking or flashing. It may be that an aircraft caused reflections or silhouette-like effects that gave the appearance of 'two objects' moving slowly across the sky.
