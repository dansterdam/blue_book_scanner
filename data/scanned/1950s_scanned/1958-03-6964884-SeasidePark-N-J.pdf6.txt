(period of morning twilight had already begun), "was a 37 mph s w wind, sometimes higher than 60". There was a dense fog which apparently had continued since the previous evening, and the pre-sunrise sky and sea were described as being "very dark". It was still pitch black when the object was first seen at about 5:18 AM EST. This, together with the fact that the pre-sunrise sky was very dark, suggests the stated position and to considering the possibility that it was WAR. COUNCIL.

The case of the "daylight meteor" is greatly ambiguous. Although it appeared as though we were dealing with some type of meteor or celestial object, I would myself favor the accidental daylight meteor explanation. While this seems to be one of the rarer daylight objects, how such a light could hold so steady and slowly cross the sky as this apparently did, I really don't know. It looks as though we progress it but it may not be possible to resolve the case with full certainty. However, in either case, I believe the witnesses saw something quite remarkable in the sky, and their report is worthy of careful consideration.

I am looking forward to visiting you in your new quartersâ€”
