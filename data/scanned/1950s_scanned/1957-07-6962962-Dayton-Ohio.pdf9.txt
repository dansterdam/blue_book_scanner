CSI OFFICER SEES UFO

July 21, 1957: On this day a UFO was observed by CSI's Organizational Vice President. The witness, a CSI officer, was sitting in his car on the deck of a boathouse about half a mile above Diamond Point, on the west shore of Lake George in northern New York. He had been taking some friends from the boathouse to their homes. The witness, who now saw it, replied: "My God, could that be it?" as he saw a luminous whirlpool-like object in the sky. The object had a brilliant golden color and three tails or streamers emanating from its rear. It moved slowly in the east-northeast, just above the treetops, and was very emphatic about the luminosity; the glow reflecting off the surface of the water below had been noticed by a passing motorist (a plane, reflecting a brilliant golden glow, had passed in the eastern sky a few minutes before).

A whirling, pulsing luminous object, apparently about the size of a basketball, was moving slowly southward (toward the observed) and did not seem to have any definite shape, since he could not see it himself, since he rushed indoors (which, when found, was not located anyway). He did, however, enough to feel sure that the object was a definite shape that had the appearance of a figure or some kind of apparatus. Its outline was not fuzzy, and its contours were well-defined. Moving deliberately southward, it appeared in all directions and then disappeared, which would seem to indicate that it was a possible target for a passing aircraft. It had been in view for four minutes by the observers; it could not have been a balloon, an airplane, or a star. It was lost in the "afterglow". It had been in view for four minutes by the observers; it could not have been a balloon, an airplane, or a star. It was lost in the "afterglow". It would seem to have been seen in the movie "U.F.O."
