Commander:
Department of the Air Force
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25 D.C.

As you were, there was no report received in this office requesting me to write to the Traffic Control Officer, and it was only upon a subsequent inspection of the file that I found that I had not received a reply from the Traffic Control Officer as the Commanding Officer requested.
I regret that I was unable to attend to this due to the pressure of other urgent matters and the somewhat unusual nature of the request, insofar as it was an indirect approach through channels rather than a direct communication. However, I have now directed that a reply be forwarded to you with the information requested.
My apologies for the delay in handling this matter, which I assure you was unintentional and due solely to the pressure of other urgent matters requiring my personal attention. I trust that the information now being provided will be of assistance.

Sincerely,
