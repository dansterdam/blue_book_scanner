AFCIN-3D:
Transfer of USAP Aerial Phenomena Program

AFCIN-3C (V/Gen Doughty):
1. In keeping with a policy of producing the maximum of aerospace intelligence production, a data analysis organization on a continuing basis. Establishment of an Air Force aerial phenomena program to Air Research and Development Command. It was pointed out at that time that this program was but part of the overall experience and it has yet to be coordinated with the air intelligence requirements of the national security. It was further pointed out that the UFO program's relative and continuing value established the Air Force was due to its ability to collect, evaluate and utilize the data available. It is my opinion that the transfer indicating that the data available was not qualified, relative and insignificant, is incorrect. This is in my opinion that any degradation of UFO traffic required to be handled by this organization. In an effort to improve the organization's responsibility this program, when closed, the data and information of the "Aerial Phenomena Program" to be transferred to SAFOI. The attached draft of a letter to General O'Donnell indicates the benefits which might be derived.

Sir, if you concur with these suggestions, it is recommended that the draft of the attached letter be authenticated and forwarded to AFCIN.
