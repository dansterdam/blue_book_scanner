There is no photograph present in the image. The image appears to be a page from a declassified Project Blue Book report on an unidentified object sighting that occurred on Okinawa on February 7, 1953.

Okinawa
I. Description of Incident
At 2122 local time radar tracked an unidentified object for 15 minutes and alerted a local interceptor squadron. An F-94 scrambled at 2123 hours, climbed to 30,000 feet, and made visual contact with a bright orange colored object which seemed to change in size and shape. The F-94 closed in to within 3000 yards and the object then seemed to disappear into a cloud for approximately 15 minutes after which it disappeared behind a cloud at an azimuth of 280 degrees. The incident was then reported.

II. Discussion of Incident
The weather consisted of scattered stratus clouds. No information is available on any meteorological phenomena or incidents related to clouds which could have given a spurious radar return. It was determined at the base that the F-94 had latched onto the time Venus which is sometimes referred to as the "evening star". The F-94 had climbed to an altitude of 30,000 feet, or 106 degrees above the horizon. It is probable that meteors by chance ground radar received a spurious plot on it, as the planet Venus was very bright. No strict correlation between the electronics sighting and visual contact can be made.

III. Conclusion
Probably Venus.
