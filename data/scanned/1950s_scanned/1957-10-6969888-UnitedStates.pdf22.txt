COMET'S HEAD AND TAIL

A COMET's head and tail is when her photographed, the tail was more now reaming nearly skies. By Dr. Willem J. Luyten, astronomer of the Observatory at Harvard College: 

A comet's head and tail are of extreme interest. After the comet's center and part of its head, which generally brighten into the form of a double envelope, the tail streams out into space. This comet, which appears near the sun every six or seven years, and is now one of the brightest comets in recent memory, attracts a great deal of attention from those who study it in the Northern Hemisphere. 

This comet appears much smaller than many comets of the past, but it has an extremely interesting feature seldom seen in comets, and said to result from the new acceleration observed in some recent comets. Dr. Whipple, director of the Harvard Observatory at Cambridge, Mass., has proposed that the comet's acceleration is due to a strange expulsion of material from its nucleus, rather like a flare of gas from the sun. Whether this theory is correct, however, remains to be seen.

Cometary experts at present seem to know very little about the process or mechanism of this extraordinary acceleration, and whether it is connected with the strange doubleness of the comet's envelopes mentioned above. But as more knowledge of the acceleration becomes available, the astronomy world may learn much from this remarkable celestial visitor.
