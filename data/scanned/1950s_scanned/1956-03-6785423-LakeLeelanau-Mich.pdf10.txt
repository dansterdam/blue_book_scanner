III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: Upon arrival in Traverse City, the source was interviewed about a sighting made by two local residents. According to the information given, on 3/30/56 at approximately 0245 hours, two local citizens observed an object in the sky over Lake Leelanau, Michigan. The object was described as being approximately 70 feet in diameter, elliptical in shape, and luminous in appearance. It was reported to have hovered for several minutes and then to have moved rapidly in a northerly direction before disappearing from view. No sound was heard. Both witnesses were reported to be sober, reliable citizens of good standing in the community. They were interviewed separately and their stories were consistent. Both stated that they had never seen anything like this before and were at a loss to explain what they had observed. The source felt that the witnesses were telling the truth and that they had actually observed something unusual in the sky. However, the source was unable to arrive at any conclusion as to the nature of the object sighted.
