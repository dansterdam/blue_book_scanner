Text extracted from the document:

again that these agreed closely with the diurnal positions of Venus.
As we left, Guess admitted that the object seen had most probably been Venus.

Finally, we interrogated the city and county police officers who had been alerted by radio call from witnesses. We were particularly anxious to discover whether anyone had seen the object approach from the west â€” the direction of the town of Darlington. No one had. Without exception all observers, questioned independently, pointed out sky positions which agreed closely with those of Venus, although they were totally unaware of this fact. Although several stated the object moved rapidly, not one placed the object in any other position in the sky than that occupied by Venus at the various times of observation.

The interrogations satisfied the investigators beyond all reasonable doubt that the positions of the object sighted over the total eight hour period were also those of the planet Venus, unless therefore, one should be willing to strain credulity and state that the mysterious object should have by coincidence occupied the sky positions of Venus over this relatively long period. One must conclude that the object observed was Venus.

One striking thing, however, is revealed by this interrogation, and that is the ease with which Venus could be seen in broad daylight. This in itself is unusual since ordinarily Venus even when at its brightest is difficult to pick out in the sky and is not at all easily pointed out to a casual observer. We must conclude that the meteorological conditions on the morning of 31 May must have been exceptional, particularly with respect to freedom from haze, to which the majority of observers attested.
