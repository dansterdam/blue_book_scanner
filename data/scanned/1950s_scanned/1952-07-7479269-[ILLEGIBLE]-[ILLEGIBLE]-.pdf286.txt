STATEMENT OF: Electo Nadain

At approximately 1907 I saw a white or silver object in the air which appeared to be a round ball which soon disappeared. Then about 30 seconds later I saw the same object. This time it kept its direction and it seemed to gain a little altitude and then it began to travel at a terrifically high speed in the direction of south. It traveled faster than anything I ever saw. It's approximate height or speed I cannot determine because I did not know the size of it. All I know is that it was definitely round and shiny. At whatever height it was, it disappeared faster than any jet that I have seen fly at low altitudes.
