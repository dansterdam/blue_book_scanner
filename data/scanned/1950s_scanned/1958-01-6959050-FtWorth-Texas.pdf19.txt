believe this object could have been a meteorite. I have observed the characteristics of the object and in my experience they have quickly through the heavens, ordinarily leaving a trail or disintegrating before disappearing. This object was any usual type of manned commercial or military aircraft, due to the color, shape and non-blinding of its light. While I have observed some aircraft with a reddish cloud with a flame-like light, the suddenness with which this object came into view while I was observing that part of the skies, the regularity of its brilliance, the lack of "trailing" and the nature of the disappearance lead me to discount the possibility of aircraft. I have rejected the possibility of weather balloon for similar reasons. The object did not erratically and the controlled and unidentified flight of the object is in news journals and on TV, with parentheses, strange colors, erratic motions, after-glow and the like. Conclusively, the object may have been a "traveling" phenomenon. I can account for the "flowing" pausing and surging with the nearby stars" only as an optical illusion based on the proximity of the stars. On Page 4 of this morning's Star-Telegram I observed an article detailed San Antonio, Texas, reporting that a Texas state highway patrolman driving 9 miles east of Hondo, Texas, had made an observation Thursday night of a flying object which traveled at a amazing speed. The description of his observation is consistent with my sighting and although I do not know, I feel confident his sighting was at approximately 7:35 p.m. 1959. The object appeared to be of no usual nature, therefore negating the possibility of aircraft. I believe the sightings were the same from points of observation over 300 miles apart, therefore negating the possibility of aircraft, weather balloons or optical illusions.
