No Case (Information Only)

4 November 1957
Chicago (Elmwood Park), Ill.

About 3:15 a.m. on November 4th came a report from suburban Chicago: three Elmwood Park police officers and a fireman saw a low-hovering 200-foot cylindrical object, red-orange in color, above a nearby cemetery; they said it appeared to be "folding into itself" until they threw their prowl car searchlight on it, at which time it began "puffing out." At this point, the searchlight dimmed and almost went out. The object began moving off in a westerly direction and although the men tried to follow it in their car, it quickly disappeared from view--by "folding into itself."
