Re: Unidentified Flying Objects

Dear Sir:

The following information was furnished to Special Agent Clement W. Parkhurst, resident agent, Richland, Washington, on June 1, 1956:

Sergeant Gordon Richardson, Kennewick, Washington Police Department, advised that about a year ago while on duty he observed a bright light moving across the sky over Kennewick, Washington. Richardson estimated that the light moved at a speed of approximately 2000 to 3000 feet per second or more. Richardson stated that the light had at least two different kinds of motors to propel it and it was emitting a "white glow" of the engine sounding like a tractor engine and apparently an internal combustion engine. 

Richardson stated that about a year ago he was on night shift when he observed a large, shining, metallic ball about 30 feet in diameter moving across the sky at a very high rate of speed and when it got about three blocks east of Richardson's location it seemed to pause or stop and then moved on at a complete breakaway speed easterly at an estimated 2000 to 3000 feet per second or more. 

Richardson stated that the ball had lost a trail of light until it dropped slowly down and made a very slight and gradual turn to the north and then on out of sight. Richardson advised that this was definitely not a jet or other aircraft, and he has no other explanation as to what this object could have been. Richardson pressed his remarks but assures the writer that this is not so.

The information furnished seems to have been weighing very heavily on his mind and he believes the information should be passed on to the Air Station or other interested Defense Agency.
