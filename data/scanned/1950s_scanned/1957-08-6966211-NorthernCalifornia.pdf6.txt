There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a "DISPOSITION FORM" document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

DISPOSITION FORM
FILE NO.  
TO:  SUBJECT:  Evaluation of UFOB Report  (IR-822-57)
FROM:   AFOTN-HLS-2   DATE:  16 Aug 1957
COMMENT NO.1
From the information given and previous reports, this does not fit any kind of hostile propagation; therefore, this action is unable to give a definite answer. It does appear that this is possibly another case of anomolous propagation.

G. F. HOFFMAN
Colonel, USAF
