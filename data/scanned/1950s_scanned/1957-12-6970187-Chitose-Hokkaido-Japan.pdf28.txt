STATEMENT
16 December 1959

My first impression of the UFO was that it was from the southwest. It appeared to be in a straight line, moving West and then to the East. It was a whitish color and quite bright. When I first saw it, it appeared quite close. After 7 or 8 minutes it began to diminish for a return to turn vertical, and it had a second visual I found the object to be dimming and moving in a Westerly direction.
