One of the witnesses alleged that the flying saucer was surrounded by
irridescent reflections and emitted around itself a slight fog. He added that when he tried to approach, he was held back at a distance of approximately 20 meters by a paralyzing force, and was violently thrown to the ground when the craft had risen into the sky.
