There does not appear to be a photograph in this image. The image shows a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The text in the document is as follows:

Dear
This is to acknowledge receipt of Air Force Questionnaire on your UFO sighting of 12 April 1959.

In order to complete the evaluation for this sighting, clarification of some of your answers is desirable. An additional questionnaire is included for your convenience.

1. #10 - Since you checked "other" as to brightness of the object, would you give more specific and detailed description?

2. #19 - Were all three objects seen at the same time? If not, please indicate approximate interval between observation of each object.

3. #20 - Please give more details of the colored lights on the object.

4. #23 - You stated the object disappeared in the distance. Could you estimate the time it took to disappear? Please give estimated total time object was visible.

5. #35 - Please give the names of other witnesses if any.

6. #39 - You indicated the speed in excess of 1,000 miles per hour. Could you give more accurate velocity indication?

You also stated that the object was in sight from five to ten seconds, but indicated at the same time that you were able to get your binoculars for a closer look. Please submit the revised questionnaire direct to the ATIC for evaluation.

Sincerely,
LAWRENCE J. TACKER
