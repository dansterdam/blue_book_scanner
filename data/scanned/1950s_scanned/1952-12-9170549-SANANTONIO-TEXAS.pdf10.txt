After the observable facts of the sighting of this phenomenon were included in my original statement, I believe that I can as fairly, fairly and accurately give a very accurate account and record of my experiences as an observer of this sight.

I believe that I can fairly accurately describe the object under concern here, its methods and actions. I can describe my observations as an observer, there is no possibility of exaggeration or second that they are unbalanced with my experiences in this case.

It has further occurred to me that this object is a hitherto unknown type of atmospheric aviation that came under the observation of the observers. Without seeing any markings or structural details, I should describe it as a low-level, remote-controlled, unmanned atmospheric device, possibly being tested or observed in the field. Where the question of my experience and qualification to make such an assessment arises, I should state that I served as an officer and pilot in the U.S. Army Air Force from May 1943 to Oct. 1945 and have an excellent working knowledge of airborne physical phenomena and their observation and study from a technical standpoint.

The object in question showed a number of characteristics and capabilities that have not been demonstrated in any known terrestrial or airborne device. The object appeared to be under intelligent control, responding in a controlled manner to changes in position and orientation. It showed no visible means of propulsion, having no observed wings, propellers, jets or other conventional propulsive devices. Its movements were rapid and erratic, capable of high-speed instantaneous changes in direction, sometimes appearing to hover motionless, then accelerating to many times the speed of sound. Its altitude varied from less than 500 feet to many thousands of feet. Its shape and size were unusual, being a luminous or semi-luminous disk, generally estimated as 30-40 feet in diameter, with occasional pulsations of brightness. No sound was audible from the object at any time.

The object in question was sighted and observed by four reliable, mature, intelligent adult observers, each of whom had an excellent record and reputation for veracity, and each of whom made separate, individual statements and reports to the authorities concerned. Two of the observers were public officials, one a county sheriff, the other a city police officer. The other two were private citizens, one a professional man, the other a businessman. Each observer, when interviewed separately, gave a substantially similar account of the object, its appearance, actions and characteristics. The observers were impressed with the object's unusual appearance and capabilities, but felt no sense of fear or apprehension. They were unanimous in their conviction that they had observed an unusual aerial phenomenon which they could not identify or explain in terms of any known or conventional aerial device.

It is my further opinion that the object warrants very serious consideration and study by the appropriate technical, scientific and military authorities, as it appears to represent a device or phenomenon of a nature and characteristics heretofore unknown, which may well have great military or scientific significance. The observations of the four reliable adult observers, the consistent nature of their individual reports, and the inherent unusual nature of the object itself, in my opinion, justify the gravest attention and investigation by the authorities concerned. No reliable evidence or data has come to light which would in any way cast doubt upon the veracity of the observers or the factual occurrence of the sighting as reported. The incident appears to be of considerable importance and interest.
