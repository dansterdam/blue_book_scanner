(Project Officer)

To tell you how we actually operate, suppose we take a hypothetical case. We'll get a telephone call, or perhaps a wire, say from an airbase in the Middle West where a pilot or some other military personnel has seen an unidentified object in the air. If it's a telephone call, we will try to get as much information as we possibly can right then, using for that purpose a check-list of questions we have developed. If it's a wire, of course we take what we get. Or perhaps we'll put in a telephone call ourselves for more information. In any event, the first thing we try to establish is who witnessed the sighting. This determines whether or not we make a field trip. Since we cannot personally contact every observer, we attempt to evaluate the preliminary information to determine whether or not a field trip will be practical.
