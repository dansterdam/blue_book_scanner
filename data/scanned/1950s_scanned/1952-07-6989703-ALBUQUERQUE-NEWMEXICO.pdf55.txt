There is no photograph or image present in this document. It appears to be a scanned page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report.

I will now proceed to act as an OCR system and produce the full text found in the document:

STATE :-   
1701's Air Traffic Rpt 
that a little background of this incident will clarify the statements 
made to be later. The question was asked: "Did they 
see any "flying discs"? The statement was made that
they did not see any "flying discs" on this occasion.
I will state that the flying objects which they did see were 
nothing like the common conception of the "flying discs" 
we hear so much about. The appearance of these objects
was quite different from the circular or disc shaped objects
which we are accustomed to think of as "flying discs". 
At 1835 Ms I was outside the hangar looking in the direction 
of so degree elevation and approximately 40 degrees to the right
of the main hangar (approx azimuth 280 degrees). The objects appeared 
to be at an altitude of about 2000 feet and were traveling in a 
generally southerly direction at an estimated speed of 200-300 mph. 
The appearance of the objects did not resemble the size or shape 
of conventional aircraft. They were a very bright, silvery color and 
apparently saucer or disc shaped. At times they appeared to be 
bright and circular, and at other times elongated or elliptical 
in shape. I watched them for approximately 2-3 minutes as they 
disappeared into the distance to the south.
Besides the date I was relating there, objects I regularly
sighted during the past two months. This time they came as 
a complete surprise. All of a sudden they were there and
then in a matter of seconds they had disappeared into 
the distance. The Air Intelligence was asked to come
and I was informed there was no one checking.
