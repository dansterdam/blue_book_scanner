Weatherman Spots a Saucer High Over Iowa

SIOUX CITY, Iowa, March 31 - Fourteen Iowans today joked the sighting of a rain-racing, mysterious "object" here Friday. 

A C. Jesse, employee of the U.S. Weather Bureau, said he saw the strange saucer-shaped object as he was leaving the Weather Bureau office. He first thought it was a weather balloon, but when I decided it wasn't, he said.

Mr. Jesse said the object appeared to be about 1,000 feet up and was moving at a tremendous speed, perhaps 10,000 to 12,000 miles per hour. It flashed out of sight in a second and a half. Mr. Jesse said it was shaped like a "flying saucer" and was shiny, pencil-shaped.

Other witnesses who were interviewed said they saw the object as well, but have denied any knowledge of the saucer.
