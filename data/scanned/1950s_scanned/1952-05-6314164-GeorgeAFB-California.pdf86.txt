STATEMENT OF WITNESS

1. The two (2) objects that I observed were of a silvery, metal color with a dark spot at the center, and, at certain angles to the sun, they gave off a bright, glistening effect which appeared much as a kite in the air. They were moving with the air currents or shown at fixed positions as they appeared to hover.

2. The objects were observed by me at 1230 hours on the date given. I kept them in my sight for 4 minutes.

3. I sighted these objects from the surface with the naked eye. I am the Intelligence Officer of the 146th Fighter-Bomber Wing.

4. At the time that I saw the objects, the weather was clear and hot, with good visibility prevailing.

5. I am the Intelligence Officer of the 146th Fighter-Bomber Wing.

6. There was no activity, meteorological or otherwise, which might have accounted for the sightings.

7. There was no physical evidence of the sightings.

8. There was no interruption of aircraft radio communication or identification.
