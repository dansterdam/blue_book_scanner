REPORTING CASE NO. DY-U-3032-L-59 PART 1 (CASE REPORT)
The report states that the contact radar of the Radar scope gradually changed its position rather than move across as expected. It did not recall the heading. No interruption was made.
While the object was visually observed at approximately 1100 o'clock position at low elevation, it would disappear at times, then reappear in approximately the same position. There were no sound or lights. It was moving, but not at constant speed. The object was observed from 1935 to 2025 hours.
