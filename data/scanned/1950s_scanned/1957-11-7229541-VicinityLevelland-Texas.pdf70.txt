III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At 0/2010Z on 3 November 1957, SOURCE was returning from Whiteface, Texas in his pick-up truck to Whitharrel, Texas. As he was driving along the highway, he observed a large, brightly lighted, elliptical object hovering near the ground about a quarter of a mile from the highway. The object appeared to be about 40-50 feet in diameter and about 10-15 feet high. It had a bluish color and a strong pulsating light was emanating from the object. After observing the object for about two or three minutes, it shot straight up and disappeared from view. The stationary object appeared to be silent and no noise was heard. SOURCE had no opinion as to the object's identification.
