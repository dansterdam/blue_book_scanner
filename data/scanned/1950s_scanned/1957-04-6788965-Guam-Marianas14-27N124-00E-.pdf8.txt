Statement of LCdr Roach (cont'd)
increase of light until the last fragments went out. I could see no other objects on either side of the aircraft or in any area which I could see.
I called for the Aircraft Commander, LCdr Harrell, who was back in the passenger cabin at the time; however, there was some delay in his being notified and it was about 15 or 20 minutes before he came forward and said that the CIRVIS report which was sent to Guam as we were not in contact with Clark when the report was ready. LCdr Harrell also passed the information on to Pan American Flight 25 Victor which was enroute to Manila and asked him to pass it to Clark by phone as soon as he got in.
