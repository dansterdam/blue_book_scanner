FOUR PLANETS NOW VISIBLE
Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn will be visible to the naked eye in June. In addition, nine bright stars, ranging from Aquarius to Vega, will be visible during the month.

BY JAMES STOKLEY

It comes as the joy planets over visible to the naked eye can be seen in June evenings, mid those bright stars will appear in the southern sky.

Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn will all be visible during the month. Venus will be the brightest object in the western sky after sunset, and can be seen for several hours each evening.

Mars, which showed up in the east about midnight in May, is now well up in the south early in the evening and will be a conspicuous object all night long. It appears much brighter than Jupiter and Saturn, which also grace the southern sky.

Jupiter and Saturn, on the other hand, are visible in the south and southwest during the evening. Jupiter is fading in brilliance, but Saturn is still fairly bright. To the west, in Aquarius, several bright stars dot the sky, including Altair, Vega and Denebola. In the northeast, the brilliant star Arcturus is visible.

VENUS AND MARS IN WEST

Venus remains the brightest star-like object in the western sky, rivaling or even exceeding the brilliance of the largest planet, Jupiter, at this time. For the month of June, Venus will be in the west, gradually sinking lower in the sky.

Mars, on the other hand, is shifting to the northwest in the evening. It has been a brilliant object, outshining even Jupiter in recent months. But now the planet is waning in brilliance.

The position of Mars is indicated on the accompanying map.  It is now much farther to the west, still quite high in the evening sky, but sinking lower as the nights go on.

JUPITER AND SATURN IN SOUTH

The two other bright planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are now in the southern sky in the evening. Jupiter is the brighter of the two, but Saturn is still conspicuous.

This makes it about 37 degrees as bright as it was last summer, when it was at its peak. The ringed planet's elevation in the sky is not as high as it was then, but it can still be seen prominently in the south.

Though not as bright as earlier, Saturn is still a majestic object, with its famous ring system well displayed to observers. This is one of the best times of year to observe Saturn, with its rings tilted favorably toward the earth.

BRIGHT STARS VISIBLE

In addition to the planets, there are also nine bright stars in the sky this month, ranging from Aquarius to Vega. These include Altair, Vega, Denebola, Arcturus and others. They make a striking pattern across the southern and western sky, adding to the beauty of the June evening scene.
