FROM CLUTTER, SPACE AGENCY-CHURCH COUNTY'S ELECTRIC BLUE MAN OBJECT-COUNTRY'S SIGHTING-

NO PICTURES WERE TAKEN AS THE OBJECT WAS ALLEGEDLY ONLY IN SIGHT FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES. IT WAS FIRST SIGHTED COMING FROM LAKE SUPERIOR DIRECTION AND WAS MOVING AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED. IT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND WAS COLORED A BLUISH-GREEN LIGHT. IT HAD NO APPARENT WINDOWS OR PROJECTIONS OF ANY KIND. ABOUT THE SIZE OF A HOUSE TRAILER, IT WAS SEEN BY AT LEAST FOUR PERSONS WHO WERE DRIVING DOWN A COUNTY ROAD NEAR CLUTTER'S RESIDENCE.

THIS OBJECT LEFT NO TRACE OF LANDING OR TAKE-OFF AND DISAPPEARED OUT OF SIGHT IN THE DIRECTION IT WAS FIRST SEEN. IT MADE NO SOUND THAT COULD BE HEARD DURING THE SHORT TIME IT WAS VISIBLE.

DAVIS, A SCHOOL TEACHER WHO LIVES IN THE AREA, REPORTED SEEING THE SAME OR A SIMILAR OBJECT THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WHILE DRIVING HOME. HE STATED THAT AT THAT TIME, TOO, IT WAS IN SIGHT ONLY BRIEFLY. ACCORDING TO HIM, IT APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL AUTOMOBILE, AND COLORED A BRIGHT BLUISH-WHITE LIGHT. IT MOVED AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND MADE NO SOUND. WHEN DAVIS TOLD SOME OF HIS NEIGHBORS, THEY REFUSED TO BELIEVE HIM, CLAIMING IT WAS ONLY HIS IMAGINATION.

THIS OFFICE CONTACTED THE COUNTY SHERIFF, WHO STATED THAT HIS DEPUTIES CHECKED THE AREA IMMEDIATELY AND FOUND NO TRACE OF ANY KIND OF LANDING OR TAKE-OFF. HE ALSO SAID THAT CLUTTER AND THE OTHERS WHO REPORTED SEEING THE OBJECT WERE SOBER AND TRUSTWORTHY INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD HAVE NO REASON TO REPORT SOMETHING THEY DID NOT ACTUALLY SEE. ALL AGREED THAT THE OBJECT CAUSED A BRIGHT ELECTRIC BLUE "GLOW" IN THE AIR AROUND IT WHICH COULD BE SEEN FOR SOME DISTANCE. THIS GLOW WAS THE ONLY ILLUMINATION IT DISPLAYED AND IT WAS NOT BEAMING OR FLASHING IN ANY WAY.

CAPT. GROUSE, WHO INTERVIEWED THE WITNESSES, STATED THAT THEY SEEMED GENUINELY DISTURBED BY WHAT THEY SAW AND NONE OF THEM TRIED TO EMBELLISH THEIR STORIES IN ANY WAY. HE SAID THEIR DESCRIPTIONS WERE CONSISTENT AND THAT THEY APPEARED SOBER AND INTELLIGENT. CLUTTER SAID HIS YOUNGEST SON, AGE 11, WAS WITH HIM AT THE TIME BUT WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT HE RAN INTO THE HOUSE AS SOON AS HE SAW THE OBJECT.
