The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a letter regarding an unidentified object sighting during a visit to Washington D.C. in February 1959. The letter requests the original negative of the photograph for evaluation by the Air Force.

Dear Mr. ______,

Your photograph taken during your visit to Washington, D. C. in February 1959 shows an unidentified object over the Capitol area.

Air Force interpreters have examined this image and believe that the image of the object is probably real. However, the original negative is needed to complete a full analysis.

In this regard, will you please forward the original negative to the air technical intelligence center (ATIC), Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for evaluation.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
