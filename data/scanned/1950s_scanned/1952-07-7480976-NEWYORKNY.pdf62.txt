The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch. The sketch depicts a horizon with an overhead view, with instructions to the observer to draw a picture that will show the motion of the object and its shape.

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position where you last saw it.
See attached note
Overhead
Horizon You Horizon

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.
At such distance could not see any motion except that these objects (?) moved from north to south.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
At such distance could distinguish nothing except shape.
