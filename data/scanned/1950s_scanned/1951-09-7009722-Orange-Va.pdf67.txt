The image appears to contain a newspaper article with the headline "Flying 'Whatsits' Seen Again". There is a photograph in the top left corner, which seems to depict a cluster of unidentified flying objects. The article discusses multiple sightings of strange objects in the Lubbock, Texas area on September 5, 1951.

MYSTERIOUS OBJECTS IN LUBBOCK SKY
- AS PHOTOGRAPHED BY CARL HART JR. OF LUBBOCK 
- THOUSANDS OF LUBBOCK RESIDENTS HAVE SEEN STRANGE OBJECTS FLOATING ACROSS SKY ON CERTAIN NIGHTS
FLYING 'WHATSITS' SEEN AGAIN
BY KENNETH RAY
THE STRANGE PHENOMENA in the skies over Lubbock, Texas, which have been the talk of that area for weeks, have appeared again, bringing further mystery to the strange situation.
Dozens of Lubbock residents reported seeing the objects again on Monday night shortly after dark. Some of the observers said they were the same type of strange formations as seen previously, while others declared the objects appeared to be entirely different and much more brilliant.
The latest sightings came just a week after the Texas Tech student photographer, Carl Hart Jr., had taken a number of photographs of the strange objects.
The objects, whatever they are, have been variously described as "flying saucers," "flying discs," "whatsits," and "flying eggs." They appear to be some form of luminous or fluorescent objects which float across the sky in formation.
The objects were first reported to public attention on Sept. 5 after being seen by Texas Tech students and verified by local citizens. Since that date, thousands of persons have witnessed the strange phenomena on recurring occasions each Monday and Thursday nights.
The latest sightings on Monday night were reported to police and sheriff's officers by scores of citizens. Several persons said they watched the objects through binoculars and telescopes and were convinced the formations were not airplanes, balloons or other known objects.

Strange Objects
LUBBOCK, TEXAS. Morning Avalanche Sept. 5, 1951.
"Objects appearing in the sky above Lubbock at intervals throughout the night of Sept. 5 were described by dozens of witnesses as 'flying saucers' or 'flying eggs,' according to reports received at The Avalanche offices.
The objects, which were visible for periods of 10 to 15 minutes, were sighted first about 9:15 p.m. and again during the early hours of the morning, the last observation being made around 5 a.m.
Witnesses stated the objects appeared to be luminous or fluorescent in nature, with a glowing, reddish-orange color, and moved in an easterly direction across the sky in formation, changing positions relative to one another.
All reports indicated the objects were at an estimated altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet and moved silently, with no visible means of propulsion. Observers also agreed the objects were circular or egg-shaped in form, and appeared to be approximately the size of a dinner plate or slightly larger when viewed from the ground.
Citizens who viewed the objects through binoculars and telescopes declared they were convinced the objects were not airplanes, balloons, or other known types of aerial phenomena. Several persons attempted to photograph the objects, but were unsuccessful owing to the poor lighting conditions and the high speed at which the objects moved. 
The objects were seen by dozens of residents, including Texas Tech students, who expressed bewilderment at the strange sightings. No satisfactory explanation for the phenomena has yet been given by military or scientific authorities."
