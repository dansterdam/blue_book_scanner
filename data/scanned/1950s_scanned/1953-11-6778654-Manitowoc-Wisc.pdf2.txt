The image does not contain a photograph. The page appears to be a typed document with text describing an observation of an unidentified flying object near Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

Manitowoc where I borrowed a pair of binoculars from a neighbor. As I looked around the sky I noticed what seemed to be the lake where I could get a clear view. As the binoculars were of poor quality I could not see anything clearly. I then returned home and waited until dark for another observation, but when I went back to the lake the object was no longer visible. The next day there was a solid overcast and the object was not observed again. However, the following day the sky was clear and I searched for the object but it was no longer visible.
