This is to acknowledge your letter of 12 January 1957 in which you requested the testing and disposition of certain negatives and photographs. 
Please be advised that this material has been re-evaluated by this office on 12 November 1956 for purposes of document evaluation and analysis.
You are advised that we have made our analysis of the objects shown in the photographs in this case, and we have concluded that no further action is merited to be taken by this office. Therefore, we are unable to consider any further questions or assistance on such matters.
However, due to the post-Christmas mass of business, and the fact that the material as this time considered handled, we were unable to notify you at this time.
We have been informed that the material will be returned to you upon their return to the United States.
We are enclosing a copy of this correspondence which you may submit if you so desire.

Sincerely,
REDACTED
