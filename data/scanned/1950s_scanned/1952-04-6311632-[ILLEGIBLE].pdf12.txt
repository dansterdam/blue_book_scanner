Dear Sir:

The following is an account received on the night of April 22, 1952 between the hours of 22:35 and 22:40 from an investigator one mile north of the city limits of Washington, D.C. by Capt. Miegel.

I observed at least twenty-five bright objects in the sky moving in a formation. They were moving at an extremely fast rate and appeared to be very high in the atmosphere. They appeared to be flying in a straight line and then would suddenly make a sharp turn. There were no lights showing on the objects, although it was quite dark. The objects were traveling from south to north.

The approximate time of the observation was from 10 to 15 seconds, and I estimate their speed to be approximately 670 miles per hour. The said indication of these objects, which appeared to be very high in the atmosphere, resembled more of a metallic appearance rather than an illuminated or lighted condition. They seemed to disappear very suddenly without any gradual fading away.

The weather was clear and there was no wind. The witnesses claim to be officers of long experience and expressed the definite opinion that the objects observed were not ordinary aircraft.
