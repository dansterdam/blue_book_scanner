Saucer photographed over Norway
"One day in July, 1957, Mrs. William Reton, Borton, of Great Barrington, Mass., U.S.A., was taking a picture of Norway's landscape when she noticed a strange object in the sky. The object, she said, moved rapidly and more or less silently as it passed across the Norway sky, and then seemed to disappear. Mrs. Reton said she had no idea what the object was, but she did manage to take a picture of it. The picture, she said, showed an oddly-shaped, disc-like object which she had never seen before."

GLOWING OBJECT OVER GERMAN TOWN
"This photograph shows an odd glowing object photographed over a German town at twilight. The object appeared for only a few moments, then disappeared. The incident was reported but no explanation for the sighting was ever given."
