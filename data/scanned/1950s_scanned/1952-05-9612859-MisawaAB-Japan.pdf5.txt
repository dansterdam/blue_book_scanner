AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
15 May 1952

STATEMENT

At 2200 hours on 8 May 1952 while steering due north to Misawa Air Base, I observed a flash of light at overhead. The flash lasted for approximately 2-3 seconds starting with a broad greenish-blue streak and ending in a puff of orange-red flame. The light first appeared at approximately 030Â° to my starboard and moved downward slightly from my port to starboard.

Previous to this flash of light I had been observing (for approx 2 min.) a flashing white light which appeared to be on the horizon and in the same direction as the light I saw overhead. After observing this light I flew north of Misawa Air Base on the coastline to a point approx. 30 miles north of the base looking for any remains of the flashing light previously seen. While doing this I was in contact with the GCI controller and upon pancaking I made a verbal report to him of what I had observed.
