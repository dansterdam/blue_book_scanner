+on finder) scope," according to the Pivett account. For the calculated RB-47 posi-
tion and speed "the bearing indication should have been moving up southwardly,"
as became apparent from the second plot. This was because of the direction of the ground
speed and the fact, bearing indication should have been "moving up southwardly."

At 10:52z, the Pivett account says that the RB-47 crew notified Duncanville that
the aircraft was "running low on fuel and would have to head back to its Topeka
base." [Chase now believes that this was done several minutes later than 10:52z, but
the discrepancy is not of consequence.]

At 10:57z, the ALA-6 showed a signal with a bearing of 300*̂ based on the RB-47
position, the bearing to this point of light would produce an indication on the bearing
meter that would be 270 .̂ This would make it possible for McClure to obtain a very
accurate measurement.

Also at 10:57z, the Pivett account says that the Duncanville radar "had no scope
contact" with the unidentified target. There is no further mention of ground radar
contacts for 10:57z. The RB-47 report indicates"RADAR CONTACT MADE BY DUNCANVILLE 
RADAR WAS LOST AT THIS TIME BETWEEN 10:44Z AND 10:50Z, AND AGAIN BETWEEN 10:54Z AND 
10:57Z" FOR NO MORE THAN SEVEN MINUTES -- between 10:44Z and 10:50Z, and again
between 10:54Z and 10:57Z.

At 10:58z, according to the Pivett account, the aircraft commander "regained
visual contact" of the light approximately 3 minutes earlier than the crew had
lost ground radar contact. The crew continues with a variety of verbal and visual
attempts to close with the object, but they are unsuccessful. Captain McClure, using
"strange and ambiguous language," explaining that it was the RB-47 that was "northwest of Ft. worth
land sight" and had made the visual contact, although no such sighting was reported with
Radar assistance. Actually Places the RB-47 west of Ft. worth, not northwest.]

At 11:00z, according to the RB-47 pilot, Chase recalls that he obtained permission to dive toward 
the visual object, and that the aircraft maneuvered to within 20,000 ft. of the
object. However, almost continuously during this maneuver the crew would lose
sight of the object. Apparently, this was probably due to the object's irregular
movement, and just after this maneuver, the aircraft gave up its chase and headed north toward Topeka.

At 11:15z, according to the Pivett account, the aircraft commander reports the flight to the Duncanville/Ft. Worth Area. Accordingly the World Almanac, official sunrise at Dallas on July 17, 1957 was 11:16. This suggests that the sky was bright enough that the crew should not find any unusual craft or object when they reached the area where the visual contact was sighted. [Duncanville] was unable to regain contact although they thought it could have landed or was maneuvering at a nearby Air Force base.

According to the Pivett account, the RB-47 finally took up a heading for home at 
11:21, and by 11:40z, the aircraft was "roughly 60 miles west of Oklahoma City."  The 11:32z
time indicates the time to cover the 60 miles, indicating an average speed of approximately
520 mph which was characteristic of the RB-47.  The aircraft's position at 10:50z when it is known
to have been near Dallas/Ft. Worth.
