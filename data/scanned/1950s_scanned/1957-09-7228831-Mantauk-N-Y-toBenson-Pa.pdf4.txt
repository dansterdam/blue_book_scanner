Range 190 n.m., altitude between 36,000 and 48,000 knots. The scope operator immediately called this track to the attention of the duty controller and the floor supervisor. The three operations personnel observed this track throughout its course until it faded at approximately 90 n.m. southeast of the station. This fade occurred within the M. Tau's area. The average speed of the track over its entire length was 5,400 knots. At the time of the incident, there were 3 UIA-32's, 4 GPA-23 consoles and one height scope in operation.  

The basis for the altitude estimation on track BB-6 was so unreliable the NCRAD team was forced to disregard it. Derivation of height associated with part of track BB-6 is discussed later in this report.

The target was detected and tracked on a UPA-35 scope but it was not observed on the height finder nor on any other scope in the operations room; however, due to the short time that this target was carried, it was impossible for the operations personnel to evaluate or assess the conditions of the other scopes in the operations room. No jamming or intense interference were present at this time and weather is fair, with no overcast with slight rain.

Further weather analysis is included later in this report.

Upon receipt of the initial target information, the 26th AD alerted other related sites within the 26th AD area to be on the lookout for this high speed track. The stations initially alerted were Highlands and North Truro. Subsequently, Clayesburg, Pa., Benton, Pa., and Lockport, N.Y. were alerted as a result of this incident.
