Conducting the program for ATIC is available for transfer along with the project. This officer is capable of performing the function spelled out in Par. 2a of this document.

It is suggested that Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Astrophysicist and Director of the Observatory at Northwestern University, be retained as the scientific consultant to the program. Dr. Hynek has performed in this capacity for ATIC since 1947, and his experience and "know how" would be invaluable to Air Force efforts in conducting the aerial phenomena program.

With your concurrence, I propose to initiate the action to transfer the aerial phenomena program to SAFOI.
