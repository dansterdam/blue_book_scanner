AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

For complete details:

1. At 2120 (EST), radar operators at GATP picked up an unknown target
at an altitude of approximately 51,000 feet. The object was tracked at an average speed of 500 knots for a distance of approximately 20 miles. The object traveled from 215 degrees to 150 degrees in azimuth. The object was tracked on two different radar scopes, confirmed by visual sighting from the control tower. The motion of the object was smooth and continuous, without any abrupt changes in course or speed. 

2. At 2135, the senior alert operator on the flight line, CATP, observed a bright light moving across the sky at a high rate of speed. The light was observed for approximately 30 seconds and then disappeared from sight. CATP states that the light was of an unusual shape and did not blink or change in intensity like normal aircraft lights.
