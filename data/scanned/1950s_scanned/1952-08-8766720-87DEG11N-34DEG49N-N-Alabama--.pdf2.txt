1. REPORT: At approximately 1305 hours 29 April 1952, while on a civil air patrol flight, a USAF Pilot, Captain Landers, observed a white object while flying at an altitude of approximately 11,000 feet. The object was first observed at a point approximately 30 miles northeast of Birmingham, Alabama, and was in sight for a period of approximately 30 minutes. The object appeared to be stationary. Captain Landers was flying in a northeasterly direction when he first observed the object.

The object did not exhibit any characteristics which would indicate that it was an aircraft controlled by any means known to the observer. The object did not reflect any light and appeared to be white in color. The object remained stationary during the entire time it was observed.
3. CONCLUSION: The object observed has not been identified. Its nature and origin remain unknown.
