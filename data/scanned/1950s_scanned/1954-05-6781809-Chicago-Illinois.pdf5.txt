As the sighting continued, it seems the objects increased in size and showed more distinct form as they approached and seemed to pass over. The witness stated that he watched them for several minutes and was puzzled as to what they could be. He felt they were definitely not airplanes, nor anything he had ever seen before. The objects appeared to be circular in shape, with a dull metallic color, and as they passed overhead, they seemed to reflect some light. He noted that they made no sound and moved in a rather erratic fashion, changing direction and speed. After passing directly overhead, they continued on out of sight to the west. The witness stated that there seemed to be about 5-6 objects, although the exact number was difficult to determine as they appeared to merge and separate at times. The sighting lasted for about 3-4 minutes. The witness, who was an electronics technician, felt that the objects were not any type of conventional aircraft and left him puzzled as to their identity. He was convinced, however, that what he observed was definitely not of this world. South, Illinois, this sighting.
