"TO: DATO (INFORMATION ONLY)

SOURCE: FLYING SAUCER MAGAZINE, 4/47, 4/55, 1415

LINCOLN, NEBRASKA

A LARGE WHITE OBJECT, ESTIMATED TO BE A JET, MOVING FAST BEHIND A ROW OF TREES. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A SILVERY WHITE, ABOUT 1600 FEET AND TRAILING SMOKE. IT MOVED ACROSS THE SKY IN A STRAIGHT PATH ABOUT HALF THE TIME BEHIND THE TREES. THEN SUDDENLY IT REVERSED COURSE AND SHOT UPWARD VERY FAST, DISAPPEARING IN ABOUT 4 OR 5 SECONDS.

IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS LIGHT HAD APPEARED, A SECOND LIGHT APPEARED, SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN THE FIRST LIGHT. THIS LIGHT HOVERED FOR A MOMENT OR TWO, THEN DISAPPEARED DOWN TO HALF ITS INITIAL ALTITUDE. AT THIS POINT IT SEEMED TO DIVE IT AND DISAPPEAR IN A SHALLOW CLIMB. THEN ANGLING UPWARD AGAIN, REPEATING THIS SEVERAL TIMES WITHIN ANOTHER 4 OR 5 SECONDS. I HEARD NO NOISE FROM IT.

ASSUMING THERE MIGHT BE A SPECIES OF FLYING SAUCERS OR TROUBLEMAKER, THE FIRST LIGHT I OBSERVED WAS PROBABLY THAT. I PERSONALLY NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF ONE, THE SECOND LIGHT I SAW COULD BE MERELY SOME SORT OF PRIVATE PLANE ABOUT 20 FEET LONG, FLYING DOWN TO ABOUT 10 FEET INTO THE CENTER OF THE BACK YARD, THEN GOING DOWN AGAIN, THEN RAISING AWAY - MAKING TO 200 FEET (OR MORE) AND APPEARING TO KEEP THE DISTANCE OF A CITY BLOCK, WITHIN THE SPACE OF SECONDS. BEFORE FINALLY DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW."
