SUMMARY: (Cover explanation of report. Give opinions in general on these particular people. List references or lead-ins. Brief analysis of report as of 27 Sept 52. - N.T.)

1. At approximately 2335 hours CST, 30 July 1952, Captain Eugene P. Daspid and Technical Sergeant James B. Hansen sighted an unusual object on the PPI scope of an AN/CPS-5 radar set located at Keesler AFB, Mass.

2. The target, which appeared on the PPI scope in a teardrop shape, was first sighted at an azimuth of 330Â° approximately forty-three (43) miles distant. The size of the target was estimated to be approximately that of a B-36 aircraft.

3. During the period of observation, the target was seen to travel in a general southerly direction for a distance of one (1) mile; a maneuver which involved two (2) minutes. It remained in a near stationary position for four (4) minutes. The object then began a very slow movement north for an approximate period of three (3) minutes where it again assumed a stationary position for two (2) almost, then disappeared completely. The target reappeared approximately three (3) minutes later and began a more rapid movement in a northerly direction for approximately FIFTY (50) miles (from the CPS-5 set) at which point it disappeared from the PPI scope. The nearest estimate as to rate of speed was forty-five (45) to fifty (50) miles per hour.

4. The unusual maneuvers and the slow speed of the sighted object, in addition to a prevailing temperature inversion, has led the observer to advance the opinion that the target was a non-flying object. Acting upon this assumption a General Agent for the Illinois Central Railroad, Emmet...
