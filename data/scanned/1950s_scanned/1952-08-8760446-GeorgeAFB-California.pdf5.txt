STATEMENT OF OBSERVER

Lieutenant William T. Van Schoonhoven, 1st Lieutenant USAF AC 28185, made the following statement:

"My attention was called to this incident at 1945 hours PST on the date in question. I was driving north on Highway 99 between George Air Force Base and Victorville, California.

The bright object appeared almost directly in my line of travel at an elevation of approximately 60 degrees. It was circular in shape, bright, and appeared to be glowing. After watching it for approximately 2 minutes, I noticed it begin to fade and then disappear completely.

If I had turned off my lights I believe I could have gotten a better view, but I felt that I should not take my eyes off the road. The object was round and the brightness could have given it the appearance of size, but the distance could not be accurately estimated. It is possible that the object was round, but the brightness could have given it the appearance of size."
