It is the opinion of this individual that the above described object could have been a great deal higher than I have expressed in this report. My judgment as to height is naturally based upon some known size of objects I am familiar with. I know what an aircraft looks like.

This object could have been any height from the earth's surface, all depending on its size. Therefore, my guess as to altitude would be incorrect.
