SONALLY
I HAVE NO POSITION TO DEMAND A DARN THING
OKAY GUSS, YOUR POINTS ARE WELL TAKEN. HOWEVER, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS WILL NOT GO OUT TO ANYBODY UNLESS IT IS SEEN AND APPROVED BY ME FIRST. I WOULD NOT EVEN THINK OF SENDING IT ANYWHERE UNTIL YOU HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK IT OVER AGAIN. I WILL HOLD IT BACK FOR THREE WEEKS OR SO JUST TO BE SURE. A GIRL FRIEND OF MINE SUGGESTED THAT I SEND IT BACK TO YOU FOR A LOOK SEE. SHE SAID IT WOULD BE ONLY FAIR TO GET YOUR O.K. BEFORE SENDING IT TO ANYONE. SO HERE IT IS-AND IF I READ YOUR VIEW POINT CORRECTLY, I WILL GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY. DON'T LET ON I KNOW YOU HAVE CALLED ANYMORE THAN I WILL TELL HIM I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD MAKE ANOTHER 'HOLLER'. I WILL MAKE A ROUTINE FOLLOW UP CALL ABOUT A WEEK OR SO FROM NOW AND PERHAPS THEN WE CAN WORK OUT SOMETHING. PLEASE DO NOT CONSIDER ME AS A CRANK OR A SPUTNICK OR A SAUCER CHASER ON TELECH AND THANKS FOR YOUR COMPLETE SYMPATHY

OUR SINCEREST THANKS IN BEHALF OF MYSELF AND THE CENTER HERE WOULD NOT HAVE NEEDED YOUR JOB FOR ALL THAT THE MONEY IN THE WORLD APPRECIATE ANYTHING IN OUR BEHALF THAT YOU CAN DO OUT OR GA WITH TRAFFIC
