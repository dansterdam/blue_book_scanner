Those reports which reach SAFOI which give indication of having possible intelligence value or scientific and technical possibilities will be forwarded to AFCIN and/or ARDC for further evaluation and/or exploitation.
The conduct of the program in the field (investigations) will still be the responsibility of the Air Force bases. At the bases it will still be preferable the intelligence function which will be responsible for these investigations.
The advantages of this transfer are: 
a. SAFOI is familiar with the Aerial Phenomena Program.
b. Reports will be evaluated immediately at the office responsible for public relations.
c. The number of reports which show promise of additional value either as intelligence and/or scientific viewpoint will be cut to a minimum, thereby allowing specializing agencies to devote more man hours per report.
d. The program will lose some of the aura of mystery which surrounds it due to the association with intelligence.
e. ATIC will be free to apply more hours, previously applied to the program, to other programs more beneficial to the Air Force.
f. ATIC realise will still get the demands which can be attributed to its association with a program so much in the public eye.
g. There are certain disadvantages associated with this change, the magnitude of which will decrease as the demands concerned become familiar with the new method of operations.
h. The requirement for the office handling this program to establish the necessary security measures for handling classified intelligence reports. It will be the responsibility of one individual not directly concerned with intelligence to determine which reports are of possible intelligence value.
