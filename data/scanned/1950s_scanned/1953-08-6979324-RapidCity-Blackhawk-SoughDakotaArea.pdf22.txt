that a very sizable temperature inversion was present, and this was
ample to magnify some of the radar and optical effects. The radar,
especially, could have been deflected back to the ground and the
moving object might have been some secondary reflection from the
plane itself. Is there any additional information about the man who
claimed to have checked the UFO against the triangle of stars, and
deciding that it moved with reference to those stars? Sounds that
it might have been autokinesis, unless this motion was really very
sizable.

                    One further question that we have. A study of the      case indicates that the UFO was merely a meteor. Appar-
ently this was a considered solution in the early days. We wonder
why it was abandoned.

                    Thank you for the additional sightings, all of which are useful
and lend freshness to the book. Also, I think you were going to send
me one from the South, where airline pilots reported not only seeing
a saucer but certain roughness of the air which, according to your own
observation, was due to forest fire or oil well fire, or something of
the sort.

                     Again, with our many thanks and best wishes, I am

                                                  Cordially yours,


                                                  (redacted)

P.S.   I'm scheduled to be in Washington on July 26. If time permits,
I may run over to the Pentagon and talk with you some at that time.
