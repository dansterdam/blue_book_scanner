The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report regarding a UFO incident in Cincinnati, Ohio on December 5-10, 1957.

AFTR 0-86 dated 29 May 58, Subj: "UFO" Motion Picture Film - Cincinnati, Ohio Incident, Dec 5 - 10, 1957 (Continued)

We were puzzled by the fact that although directions, locations or official identifications were specifically asked for in both the questionnaire (questions 27, 30 and 31) or the UFO Questionnaire submitted, no answer was given.

A check with radar units and GCI posts that scan this area 24 hours of the day indicates military and civil flights; in well as other persons show no unusual for that locality within a three-week period of the general data given.

We cannot comment on any probable motives on the part of the observer other than what appears to be a picture of the moon, over four months after the incident took place. 

The original film for return to Mr. [redacted] is attached.
