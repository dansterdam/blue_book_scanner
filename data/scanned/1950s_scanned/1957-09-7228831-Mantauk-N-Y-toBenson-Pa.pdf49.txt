MEMORANDUM TO: Mr. Areier, 4X1
THRU: Colonel Gilbert, AR
SUBJECT: Evaluation of Air Defense Radar UFO Incident - Montauk, N.Y.

Reference is made to Gen Walsh's request to Gen Watson, regarding certain particulars on a long-duration, possibly hostile, high-speed targets over Montauk, N.Y. As reported(ly) originating near Martha's Vineyard, these targets were detected by radar and recognized from their established orbits and flight characteristics.

On 20 September 1957, the radar unit at Montauk, N.Y. picked up originally by the radar unit at Highlands, N.J. a series of high-speed targets. The radar units at Highlands, N.Y. and Otis AFB, Mass. locked on to these units, but could not make contact with the supposed targets.

The radar units detected signals from KINROSS AFB (ARC) (Michigan) as well as two additional F-102s* from Truax AFB (Wisconsin) on the targets towards a ground-controlled intercept in that direction. No definite identification of the targets was made, but it was significant to point out that the last observed track was in the vicinity of Benson, Pa. (northeast of Montauk) and not in the vicinity as reported to ATIC).

Weather conditions: overcast and calm.

It is recommended that up a radar team study this incident, including similar targets if they should appear.

On 25 September, a radar team noted a series of blips on the radarscope of the Montauk, N.Y. station, the unit originally reporting the targets. These targets, lasting over 20 minutes, exhibited continuous high-speed movement and disappeared. They reappeared when the previous channel was tuned in.
