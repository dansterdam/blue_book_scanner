Roame Co. Airpt:

I was contacted this A.M. on Sept. 29, 1958 by Mrs. (name redacted) of Milan, Indiana, who reported an incident she and her husband observed on the night of Sept. 30, 1958 at 4:30 A.M.

Mrs. (name redacted) stated that she and her husband were awakened at 4:30 A.M. on Sept. 30, 1958 by a bright light in the sky. She said the object was stationary for about 10 times as bright as the brightest star they had ever seen. She stated the object seemed to be hovering and appeared to be about the size of a half-dollar held at arm's length.

She said the object remained stationary for a few moments and then rapidly accelerated in a straight line until it disappeared from view in about 2 or 3 seconds.

Mrs. (name redacted) said she and her husband were quite disturbed by the incident and wanted to report it. She stated she had never seen anything like it before and did not know what it could have been.
