REPORT INVESTIGATION -- AVIS TWO-ENGINE JET PLUME IN VICINITY OF ROME, NEW YORK

THIS REPORT TELLS THE EXPLANATION IN DETAIL OF THE INCIDENT OF OBJECED SEEN IN VICINITY OF ROME, NEW YORK. IT APPEARS THAT THIS INCIDENT REPRESENTS WHAT WE CALL. PROPERLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY AS A NATURAL PHENOMENON OF NATURE.

IT WAS AT FIRST THOUGHT TO BE AN UNUSUAL OBJECT AND UPON FIRST SIGHT, AND FROM APPEARANCE, IT COULD HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR A STRANGE FLYING OBJECT. HOWEVER, ON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, IT WAS FOUND TO BE CAUSED BY THE EXHAUSTED PLUME OR TAIL PIPE EMISSIONS FROM A COMMERCIAL TWIN-ENGINE JET AIRCRAFT PASSING THROUGH THE AREA. THE AIRCRAFT WAS IDENTIFIED AND FURTHER CHECK UP REVEALED THAT THE EMISSIONS FROM THE TAIL PIPE OR ENGINES CREATED THE UNUSUAL APPEARANCE WHICH CAUSED THE REPORT TO BE MADE.

THIS REPORT APPROVES THE NATURAL EXPLANATION AND CLEARS UP THE QUESTION OF THE STRANGE OBJECT SEEN BY SEVERAL OBSERVERS IN THE AREA.
