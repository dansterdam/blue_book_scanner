Should the files of Blue Book ever be thoroughly examined by competent scientists, this incorrect statistical procedure will stand out as being most unsatisfactory. Though more cumbersome, the proper thing to do is, of course, to carry in the statistical records the number of, let us say, aircraft, private airplanes, and possible aircraft cases as separate entries.

The past evaluation, "probably balloon" has a low priority since there is only a partial report. It was launched 10 minutes earlier in that general area, and there were two witnesses who have stated that the object entered the southeasst at a fast rate of speed. It was stated that the object remained almost motionless for 10 minutes, whereupon it stopped, made several maneuvers, reversed its field until it reached its original position, stopped and took off directly east at an estimated speed of 400 miles per hour. Observers stated that the object changed from globular form to elongated form as it was moving faster than sound.
