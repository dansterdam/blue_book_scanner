Mrs . Coburn's story of a u.f.o. she observed on 2-9-59 is as follows:
At approximately 6:45 a.m. on February 9, 1959, Mrs. Coburn was looking out her bedroom window and observed a round, shiny object hovering above the hills to the east of her home. The object appeared to be approximately 40 feet in diameter and was a metallic gray color. It hovered silently for about a minute and a half, then suddenly shot straight up out of sight at a tremendous speed. Mrs. Coburn stated that the object appeared to be rotating or revolving as it hovered. She also stated that she had a good view of the object as the sky was clear at the time. The case was investigated by project Blue Book personnel.
