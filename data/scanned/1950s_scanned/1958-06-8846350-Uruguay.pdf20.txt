Here is the text from the document:

---
We checked the sky for airplanes that
there were none.

I have no explanation for this incident,
but I do know I saw this object and
my mother is sure, too. The reason we didn't
report it was because we didn't believe in
UFO's then and it wasn't very popular then.
The reason I am writing now is because I am
beginning to believe in them more and more now.

I am not writing this as a prank and I
hope this report can bring us to some
understanding.
Sincerely,
[Signature redacted]
