The image appears to contain a photograph or some kind of visual representation, but it does not depict any human faces. The photograph shows what looks like a circular or spherical object with a grid or graph-like pattern inside it, set against a dark background.

1945 RADAR RETURN AT MONTGOMERY FIELD. ON 29 OCT 1954 WHILE MAKING CALIBRATION FLIGHTS OVER MONTGOMERY FIELD, RADAR OPERATORS PICKED UP AN UNEXPLAINED RETURN ON THEIR SCREENS. THE RETURN WAS DESCRIBED AS A ROUND METALLIC OBJECT ABOUT 50 YARDS IN DIAMETER WHICH MADE SEVERAL PASSES OVER THE FIELD AT AN ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 1000 FEET. THE OBJECT APPROACHED FROM THE WEST, PASSED DIRECTLY OVER THE FIELD, AND THEN TURNED AND DEPARTED IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION. AIR CONTROLLERS CALLED THE PILOT OF ONE OF THE AIRCRAFT FLYING IN THE AREA AND ASKED HIM TO TRY AND INTERCEPT THE OBJECT, BUT BEFORE HE COULD DO SO IT HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE RADAR SCREENS.
