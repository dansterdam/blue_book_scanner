34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 20 Feb 1959

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting:

The object appeared to be about 150-200 feet in diameter, and was approximately 2000-3000 feet in altitude, moving from north to south, over the area southeast of Louisville, Kentucky. The object appeared to be disc-shaped and had a bright, shiny metallic surface. It moved at a very rapid rate of speed, and was observed for about 30 seconds. The object seemed to slow down, hover, and then accelerate and disappear from sight. This is my best estimate from visual observation. The night was clear, and I saw the object quite plainly. I have observed many aircraft in flight, and this was definitely not any conventional aircraft. I am an airline pilot and have had considerable experience in identifying aircraft in flight. I am convinced that this was an unidentified flying object of some kind.
