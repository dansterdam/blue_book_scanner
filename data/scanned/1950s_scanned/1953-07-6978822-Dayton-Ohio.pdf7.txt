TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Speaks: I might add, no paper trails were seen.

I realize because of the laws of physics, the impossibility of travel as known, and also that humans are able to study and know at most only a small fraction of the total of all that has been developed to the present in science and such types of knowledge as are known, we must conclude that there are other "higher-evolved" beings than we ourselves, perhaps, who may have developed in the last 100,000 years, perhaps, we still now realizing the problems and working out the details on a scale which is completely remote for our own imagination, not to speak of actual scientific knowledge.

I am the one before believing in outer space people.

If "saucers" are space experimentation of our own government, I am convinced something is going on.
