FAIRMONT, W. VA.
O. 10/6/57
This letter has been written in response to a phone call received this morning requesting information regarding my sighting of unidentified flying objects on the evening of October 22, 1957 in the vicinity of Fairmont, West Virginia.
On the above mentioned date I was returning home from my place of employment in Morgantown, West Virginia. As I was driving along route 19, in the vicinity of Fairmont, I observed three bright, unconventional objects in the sky traveling in a westerly direction at a very high rate of speed. These objects were completely silent and were much brighter than the surrounding stars or planets. They appeared to be at a very high altitude, possibly in the vicinity of 30,000 to 40,000 feet. They were not blinking or flashing in any manner, but emitted a steady, brilliant glow. As I watched, the objects suddenly made a turn towards the south and disappeared from sight almost immediately.
After reaching my home in Fairmont, I called the police and notified them of what I had observed. They stated that they had already received several similar reports from other citizens in the Fairmont area. I have no idea what these objects were, but the sight was most unusual and not at all comparable to any aircraft that I am familiar with. If any further information is required, please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely yours,
Walter Giesler
