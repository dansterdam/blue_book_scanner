The object which came out of the sky appeared bright, at 500 yards was about 50 feet in diameter, was oval in shape, and was larger in the center than on the ends. It was higher in the center than on the ends and flat on the bottom. According to reports, it illuminated the countryside and the men's faces. It passed over the vehicle and the men said that when the object passed over them the engine and headlights of their vehicle went dead. They said that when the object passed, it made no noise. The object took off at a terrific speed, straight up, and disappeared. One of the men said the patrol was about 100 miles an hour heading east when the object appeared and stopped the car.

Bill Ledman said the patrol was about 1 1/2 miles east of Levelland when the incident occurred. He said a heavy rainstorm was in progress at the time with strong winds. He said when the object appeared, the patrol car radio went dead and the engine and lights went out. He said the object was only about 20 to 30 feet off the ground when it passed over them.

Corky Carnes said the patrol was about half a mile east of Levelland when the incident occurred. He said the object appeared to be about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and was traveling at about 500 mph. He said it illuminated the countryside and the men's faces, and when it passed over, the engine and lights went dead. He said the object took off straight up at a terrific speed and disappeared.

Chief Deputy Sheriff Weir Clem said he had interviewed the two men and that they seemed quite sincere. He said they appeared to be sober and not under the influence of anything. He said the men seemed to be telling the truth about what happened. Clem said the men were part of the Levelland Police Department and were traveling east on Highway 116 at the time of the incident.

According to the newspaper report, Oct. 25, the men said they were enroute to Levelland when the incident occurred. They said the object resembled a flaming red goblet, hovering motionless for a few seconds, then taking off at a tremendous speed. They said the object appeared to be about 200 to 300 feet in diameter. This report appeared in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal.

Dr. J. Robert Mosely said that on the night of the object, glowing with a reddish-orange color, the engine and lights of his car went dead as it passed over him. He said the object appeared larger than a car, and it shot up into the sky at a terrific speed. Mosely is head of the West Texas Museum at Texas Technological College in Lubbock.

Weems E. Bowers, said he had investigated the incident and that the two men appeared to be telling the truth. He said it seemed they were unaware of the existence of such a large object in the sky. Bowers said the men reported the object illuminated the countryside and their faces when it passed over them.

Mrs. David L. Patrice, wife of a Levelland resident, said she was driving on the highway at the same time as the two men, and that her engine and lights also went dead as a similar object passed over her car. She said she was about 1 1/2 miles east of Levelland when it happened.
