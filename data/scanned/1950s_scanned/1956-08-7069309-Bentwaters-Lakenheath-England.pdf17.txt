TEXT FROM THE DOCUMENT:

19 August 1956

1. At approximately 2200 hours on 13 August 1956, radar operators at Bentwaters and Lakenheath Radar Stations, England, observed several unidentified targets on their radar scopes. The targets were tracked for two and one-half hours, and their speeds were estimated to be between 600 and 700 mph.

2. The targets were observed to make abrupt changes in course and speed, far beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. The targets were tracked at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,000 feet. No visual sightings were made from either radar site.

3. Fighter aircraft from RAF Bentwaters were scrambled to intercept the targets but were unable to gain contact.

4. This incident was reported through regular intelligence channels to higher headquarters.
