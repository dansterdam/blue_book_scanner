Transcription of the text in the document:

PART OF
PROJECT BLUE BOOK

APPEARED HORIZONTAL PROJECTION, OBSERVERS BACK TOWARDS FRONT. DISAPPEARED.

21. IF POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand?
(Circle One):
a. Head of a pin
b. Pea
c. Dime
d. Nickel
e. Quarter
f. Half dollar

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22):
1. Very sure
2. Moderately sure
3. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? BRIGHTNESS FELL OFF AS A FUNCTION OF DISTANCE, UNTIL THE OBJECT BECAME TOO FAINT TO OBSERVE.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it have? (Do not mention the name of the constructor or where it would give the same appearance as the object that you saw).

IT CANNOT EXTRAPOLATE MUCH MORE, THAN THAT IT WAS A SOURCE OF LIGHT. TO AVOID CONFUSION IT COULD POINT OUT, THAT IT MOST DEFINITELY WAS NOT A METEOR, AND I MUST REFUSE TO GUESS.
