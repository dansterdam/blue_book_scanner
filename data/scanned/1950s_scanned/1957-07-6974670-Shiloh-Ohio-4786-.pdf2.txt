SUMMARY OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT REPORT

Date of Sighting: 9 July 1957
Time of Sighting: 8:30 P.M.
Location of Sighting: Shiloh, Ohio
Duration of Sighting: 5 minutes
Number of Witnesses: 3

Observation:
Three witnesses reported seeing two bright objects in the sky for about 5 minutes. The objects were described as circular in shape, reddish-orange in color, and approximately 50 feet in diameter. The objects were observed to make a sharp 90 degree turn and then accelerate out of sight at a high rate of speed.

Evaluation:
The investigating officer concluded that the sighting was probably caused by two aircraft engaged in night training maneuvers. The sharp turn and high speed acceleration was consistent with typical aircraft movements.
