The image contains a photograph of a document. The document appears to be an official report from the Soviet Astronomer Kozyrev, who recently photographed an eruption on the moon. The report describes the eruption as a reddish glow that grew in intensity over two hours, and Kozyrev believed it was a normal development of a volcanic process on the surface of the moon. The report also suggests that the processes responsible for the formation of the surface features on the moon may also apply to the earth and other planets.

MOSCOW, NOV. 13--(UPI)--SOVIET ASTRONOMER NIKOLAI KOZYREV RECENTLY PHOTOGRAPHED A VOLCANIC ERUPTION ON THE MOON, THE OFFICIAL SOVIET TASS NEWS AGENCY SAID LAST NIGHT.

KOZYREV TOOK THE PHOTOGRAPH AT ABOUT 4 A.M. MOSCOW TIME NOV. 3 WITH THE 50-INCH REFLECTOR OF THE CRIMEA ASTROPHYSICAL LABORATORY, TASS SAID.

KOZYREV DESCRIBED THE ERUPTION AS A REDDISH GLOW THAT GREW IN INTENSITY AFTER TWO HOURS. "THERE WAS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF A VOLCANIC PROCESS ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON," HE SAID.

CHAIRMAN OF THE ASTRONOMICAL COUNCIL OF THE SOVIET ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, SAID SPECTROGRAMS LEFT NO DOUBT THAT KOZYREV HAD SEEN A VOLCANO.

"WE CAN NOW REGARD AS ENTIRELY WRONG THE VIEW ON THE ORIGIN OF THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE LUNAR LANDSCAPE AS BEING DUE TO THE IMPACT OF METEORITES," HE SAID.

"THIS VOLCANIC ERUPTION SHOWS THAT THE PROCESSES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FORMATION OF THE SURFACE RELIEF APPLY BOTH TO THE EARTH AND THE MOON."
