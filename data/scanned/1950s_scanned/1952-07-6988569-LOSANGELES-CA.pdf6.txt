This page from the Project Blue Book document does not contain any photographs. The text is handwritten and appears to describe a sighting of a "strange aircraft" or unidentified flying object.

The text reads:

"A strange aircraft in a speed 3-4 times that of our jet plane. The object was extraordinary and was flying 8 to 10 times as high as the world star."

The observer seems to have provided further comments and details about the sighting, which are recorded on this page.
