WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

1. Reference is made to the attached report concerning the sighting of an unidentified aerial object in the vicinity of Scranton, Pennsylvania, on 15 November 1952.

2. DETAILS: On 15 November 1952, at approximately 0645 hours, an unidentified flying object was observed by a trained observer at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet in the vicinity of Scranton, Pennsylvania. The object was observed for a period of approximately 3 to 5 minutes as it traveled in a northeasterly direction at an estimated speed of 400 to 500 miles per hour. The object was described as being cylindrical in shape, approximately 40 to 50 feet in length, and giving off a bright steady light. No trail or exhaust was observed. The object was not picked up on radar.

3. COMMENTS: The identity of the unidentified flying object observed in this instance has not been established. However, detailed investigation and evaluation of the data obtained indicates that the possibility of the object being an aircraft or other conventional aerial device is considered remote. The object was reported to have been traveling at a speed far in excess of any known powered aircraft and at an altitude well within the operating ceiling of conventional aircraft.
