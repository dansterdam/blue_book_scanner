Dear Allen:

Here is the flying saucer story I referred to in my last letter. Since you have been on an evaluation board, you may be amused.

It is an interesting example of pretty objective observation by the people who thought they saw a "flying saucer". They later even described the ringlike structure of telescope dish, which is covered only with a wire mesh, of course. All they described was the turning off of the lights underneath and those small movements of telescope from the roadside for motion!

Sincerely,
