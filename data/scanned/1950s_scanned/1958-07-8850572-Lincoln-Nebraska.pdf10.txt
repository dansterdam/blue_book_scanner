Text from the document:

Memo, AFCIN-4E2, 23 Mar 60, "UFO Film" (Let Ind (AFCIN-4D4))
28 March 1960
TO: AFCIN-4E2

1. The attached motion picture was carefully reviewed, but was unable to disclose any undisplayed flying objects. Throughout the film, however, there are bright spots or reflections and intermittent white lines which are undoubtedly caused by reflections of and on various objects on and within the atmosphere in which the photography was riding. Information inside the lens system when a camera is used on a bright sun-shining day, as the photographer has mistaken these defects in the photography caused by excessive reflected light for a UFO.

2. A copy of the film was not made. It is suggested that the original be returned to the sender.
