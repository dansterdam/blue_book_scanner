RESEARCH ROCKET FIRED
WASHINGTON, AUG. 27 (AP)
The United States launched the first in a series of new Nike research rockets today. It left a white-orange cloud that was visible over much of the eastern seaboard.
The rocket was fired from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Wallops Island on Virginia's Eastern Shore.
ONE--To determine wind direction and velocity over the range covered by the trail.
TWO--To measure diffusion or dispersion of the rocket's vapor trail in the upper atmosphere.
The yellow color of the vapor trail is characteristic of burning sodium. It was set off by a thermite device when the rocket reached an altitude of about 50 miles.
