1. During the dates 7 February to 9 February 1956, sightings of unidentified flying objects occurred which were tracked by radar installations operated by the USASA and in three instances by radar controlled searchlights operated by the AAACS.

2. On 8 February 1956 between the hours 1300 - 1600, Pfc Richard E. Bolten, USASA, observed several light-emitting objects in the sky moving at extremely high speeds, estimated at over 2,000 miles per hour and at an altitude of over 25,000 feet.

3. On 9 February 1956 between the hours 1200 - 1400, Pfc Richard D. Warfe, and Pfc Sicard, both from Co. "A" 325th Tank Battalion, observed an unidentified object which appeared to be several miles distant and at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet. The object emitted a tremendous burst of speed from grid square 6114 to grid square 5314, a distance of approximately 7 miles, in 3 to 5 seconds.

4. The sightings were reported to the George Air Force Base Intelligence Officer. Air Force Intelligence personnel made a visit to this installation and confirmed the details of these sightings. The reliability of the witnesses is considered to be good.
