1. Reference the attached letter from Steff Millard requesting information on unidentified flying objects. The following information is provided to assist you in answering his letter:

2. There have been no reports of Venusian's living in the Pentagon nor reports of flying saucers on the surface of the moon. We do not deny the possibility that there may be life on other planets. We simply state that to date the Air Force has no evidence to substantiate this fact and we have no evidence of intelligent beings from other planets visiting our atmosphere in space ships.

3. The summary of the Washington D.C. sighting of 1952 and the summary of the Mantell case should answer the remainder of Mr. Millard's questions.

4. We are attaching an FTD Form 164 for his use.
