The following is extracted from an original report written by an Airman observer in the vicinity of and contains observations of an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of Caja de Marca, Peru, on 10/26/57: 

First I saw an object white-steel-gleaming on October 26th, '57, at approximately 2200-2230G at Caja Marca, Peru. The object was visible for more than 30 minutes, at times appearing to move at a fast rate of speed. 

As I watched, the object seemed to be slowly climbing or descending, and it appeared to be elongated in shape. The direction of the object's motion was toward the southwest. At times it appeared to be pulsating or flashing. 

Azimuth angle; 104.3 ° and Elevation angle: 30.3° 
On 10/27/57 the object was at a higher elevation angle of 119°. Azimuth angle and Elevation angle: direction not exactly eastward. Object appeared to be moving slowly to approximately 30° - 35°. On this date the gleaming object was visible from 1800 to 1939 approximately 1 hour and 39 minutes. It was observed by the automatic "Zeta" recording theodolite.
