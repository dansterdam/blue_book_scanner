The image contains a sketched diagram of a UFO sighting. It includes details such as the direction and path of the object, as well as the observer's position. The text below the image appears to be a filled-out questionnaire regarding the UFO sighting, including details about the appearance and movement of the object.

The text from the document is as follows:

14. Did the object disappear while you were watching it? If so, how?

18. We wish to know the angular size. Hold a match stick or arm's length in line with a known object and note how much of the object is covered by the head of the match. If you have determined this experiment at the time of the sighting, how much of the object would have been covered by the match head?
Covered 1/4 to 1/2

19. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
