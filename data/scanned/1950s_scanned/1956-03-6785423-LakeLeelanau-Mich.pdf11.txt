AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
F'13 3-C. 46024 AIRS  30-UFOB-2-56 Part 1, 13 Pages
SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS:
1. A check with the 752nd AC&W Sq and weather for radar and weather data associated with the sightings.
2. Sgt. K., 752nd ACAW Sq, contacted personnel of the 752nd AC&W Sqd and it was determined that there were no radar films made during the period covered by these reports.
3. Extensive informal questioning of personnel of the 752nd AC&W Sqd revealed that there was a possibility that the sightings were connected with the launching of weather balloons from Traverse City at about the time of the sightings.
4. 1/Lt Sahlin and l/Lt Reske of the radar site stated that they had observed a "bright light" at the time of the sightings.
5. In relation to the sketching by Mrs. M - (see Part five), the moon was determined to be the back door of her house faced east and that the moon would be moving in the direction she had sketched. Although this is an end, it is reasonable to assume that Mrs. Dillard was viewing the moon.
Possible explanations for the color-changing of the object: 
(1) Ordinary illumination have no chromatic correction - 
(2) There is a slight varying of refraction due to unequal heating.
In relation to the sketch by Mr. F - (see Part six), the planet Venus at this time was a brilliant object high in the western sky and it would appear as a crescent-shaped object. There is an unaccountable explanation for the phenomenon he observed.
1/Lt Sahlin, who had been mentioned as possible source by Sgt. Dillard, was on leave at the time of the investigation and could not be contacted.
