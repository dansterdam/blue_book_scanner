AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

2/7/52 Airman Meilock Mick
on this date whe first witnessed two objects in the sky. The first object was first observed at about 9:30 p.m. as a small bright light near the horizon to the west. This light seemed to grow larger and brighter and was moving in a northeasterly direction. The second object was observed about 15 minutes later at about 9:45 p.m. This was larger than the first and appeared to be a disc-shaped object with a dark center and a bright orange glow around the edges. This object was traveling in a Northerly direction and was observed for about 1 minute, during which time it appeared to change position.

10. ANALYSIS: This report appears to be a valid one and the observations made seem to be of interest. The only weakness appears to be the lack of definite time reference on the first observation and the brevity of the observation of the second object. In general, the report gives a reasonably accurate account of the sightings and the descriptions of the objects seem to be consistent with other reports. There is no reason to disbelieve this report.
