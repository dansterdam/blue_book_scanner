1. Due to the non-availability at this organization of AF Form 112 "Air Intelligence Information Report", the expanded written report on this initial telephonic message 20 May 1953 is being submitted in letter form.

2. As reported by five (5) airmen observed the unidentified object:

(1) Was round and orange colored, relative size - much smaller than the size of the full moon at full, and appeared to be approaching the base in an automobile from the west, and about 5 miles from the hill around which the object seemed to hover. The object approached the hill from the north slowly, a wing seemed to move slightly, and it was thought to be some kind of a machine. It was being observed through binoculars installed on hill and an AF-type-6 that is being used as a listening post, was not operational due to repairs.

(3) The five airmen drove their car towards the hill and the object appeared to remain stationary, hovering on the hill. The object was about fifty (50) miles and only into a climb observed. It did not appear to make any noise and seemed to hover on the hill. It did not appear to be controlled by any of the airmen on duty on the hill. It had a definite shape to it and did not appear to be fuzzy.
