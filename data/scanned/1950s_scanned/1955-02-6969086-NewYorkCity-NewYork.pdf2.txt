COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO

SUBJECT: UFOB Report
TO: Commander 
Air Technical Intelligence Center
ATTN: Captain Charles Hardin (AFCIN-4B)
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio

1. Enclosed is a UFOB Report transmitted to this Squadron by Hq. 26th AD (Defense).

2. This Squadron concurs in the hypothesis of the Resorting Officer that the sighting was possibly caused by research light activity. There have already been other reports from this same vicinity caused by similar phenomena (see refer 8'ngth, of dated 5 March 1953, Incl 1). However, because of inability at this time of gaining much more information, there will be no further investigation in this matter.
