I was part of a group beach near Bridgman, Michigan around 21.00 hours Saturday. Eight of us saw a bright light move rapidly from East to West in the southern sky. This spot of light looked rather like the spot made by a search light such as used by carnivals when the light hits low clouds. The path of this spot was nearly perfectly parallel to the horizon. After traveling roughly half way across the southern sky the light simply disappeared. There was no haze over the lake so there was no definite outline to the spot and it probably appeared much larger than it actually was. I cannot say what the elevation above the horizon was but I would estimate this at about 20 degrees.
