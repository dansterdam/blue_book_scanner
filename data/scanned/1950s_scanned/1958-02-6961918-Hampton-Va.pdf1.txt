10. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING
A series of lights in V formation. The lights were blinking 2 blocks of 3 at a time, giving the appearance of 6 lights blinking alternately. The lights then remained steady for about 2 hrs. and then went out. The lights were low on the horizon and appeared to remain at about the same position during the sighting.
11. COMMENTS
The lights had the appearance of being very high up and appeared to be a solid formation. His first impression was that the lights were a formation of aircraft which had their landing lights on. However, the duration of the sighting and the fact that the lights remained in the same relative position seemed to indicate that this was unlikely. His impression was that the formation was a rather high altitude and that the lights were probably not aircraft.
