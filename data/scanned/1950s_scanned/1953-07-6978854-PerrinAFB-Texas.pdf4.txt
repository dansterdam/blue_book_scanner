Statement by 1/Lt Thomas M. Davis Jr.

Data Operation advised me of the sighting of the lights last night at the field. 
The lights were seen moving in erratic and oscillating manner, appearing and disappearing at various intervals. They were of a bluish-white color and seemed to be at a high altitude, possibly several thousand feet. They were sighted for approximately 25 to 30 minutes. The lights appeared to be coming from the southeast, moving in a northwesterly direction and then reversing their course, repeating this maneuver several times.

The total number of lights observed was difficult to determine, as they appeared to wink out at times and then reappear at other times. The individual lights also varied in size, some appearing quite large and others smaller. The speed of the lights was estimated to be in excess of 1,000 mph. No sound was associated with the lights.

The lights were observed by several pilots and crew members who were on the line at the time. I directed that the information be forwarded to higher headquarters, through channels, for any further action deemed necessary.
