Dear Sirs:
This is to inform you of a UFO sighting I had on September 21, 1958. I would appreciate it very much if you would send an investigator or someone to explain this happening to me. It was a terribly frightening experience.
I assure you that I will contact my congressman about this matter if some action is not taken soon to explain it.
No private citizen should be placed in the path of government devices, if that is what it was. If it was a space craft, steps must be taken to warn the public.
The summary included here was prepared by a private UFO investigator who interviewed me and the other people who reported strange objects that morning.
Sincerely,
[Signature Redacted]
