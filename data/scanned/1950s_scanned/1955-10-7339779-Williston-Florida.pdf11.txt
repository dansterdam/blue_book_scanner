Occupation: City Policeman
Education: 5th grade - elementary
Qualifications: Unknown

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE GAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO EACH QUESTION ASKED AND APPEARED TO BE HONESTLY AND SINCERELY DESCRIBING WHAT WAS OBSERVED. SOURCE WAS FAIRLY WELL KNOWN TO THE INVESTIGATOR, WHO CONSIDERS HIM RELIABLE.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING:
SOURCE'S STATEMENT: "I FIRST SIGHTED THE OBJECTS WHILE MAKING A ROUTINE PATROL CHECK AT APPROXIMATELY 1:25 A.M. ON 28 OCTOBER 1955. THE OBJECTS, EIGHT IN NUMBER, WERE FIRST NOTICED ABOUT 10 DEGREES ABOVE THE SOUTHERN HORIZON AND SLIGHTLY WEST OF SOUTH. THEY APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND ABOUT THE SIZE OF A QUARTER HELD AT ARM'S LENGTH. THEY MOVED IN A HORIZONTAL DIRECTION AT A STEADY RATE OF SPEED, MAINTAINING THEIR RELATIVE POSITIONS TO EACH OTHER. THERE WAS NO SOUND OR VAPOR TRAIL OBSERVED. AFTER WATCHING THEM FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES, THEY GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED BELOW THE SOUTHERN HORIZON."
SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO ESTABLISH A MORE PRECISE DESCRIPTION AND OBTAIN ADDITIONAL DETAILS, BUT THE SOURCE COULD ADD NOTHING FURTHER TO HIS ORIGINAL STATEMENT. HE STATED THAT HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT WHAT HE SAW WERE NOT AIRCRAFT, SINCE HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE APPEARANCE OF ALL TYPES OF AIRCRAFT OPERATING IN THE AREA. AT NO TIME WAS ANY SOUND OR VAPOR TRAIL OBSERVED.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: ABOUT 10 MINUTES AFTER 22/0300Z, THE OBJECTS WERE AGAIN OBSERVED BY THE SOURCE, THIS TIME MOVING IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THEY APPEARED MUCH SMALLER THAN BEFORE AND WERE ONLY VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS. THE SOURCE STATED THAT ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT BE CERTAIN, HE BELIEVED THE OBJECTS WERE SEEN TO MAKE A SHARP, RIGHT-ANGLE TURN WHILE MOVING AT THIS HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE SOURCE STATED THAT AT NO TIME DID HE OBSERVE ANYTHING RESEMBLING CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
