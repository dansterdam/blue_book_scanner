Other Mysterious Fragments

In the spring of 1950 Mrs. Coral Lorenzen, director of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, publicly challenged the Air Force statement that "physically concrete evidence" of flying saucers has never even a minute fragment of so-called "flying saucer" has ever been found.  [sic] Mrs. Lorenzen announced that she had in her possession the remains of a disc-shaped object that had met with disaster in the earth's atmosphere.  Without specifying the date and location of the event, the identity of the witnesses, or any corroborative details of the alleged disaster, she merely said that several persons had witnessed the catastrophe.  She went on to assert, somewhat astonishingly, that "the gratifying aspect of this case, however, is that we do not have to depend on the testimony of witnesses to establish the reality of the incident for the most startling physical evidence has been produced through the application of any known forensic techniques."
