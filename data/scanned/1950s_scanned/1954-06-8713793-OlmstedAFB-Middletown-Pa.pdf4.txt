The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows the trajectory of an observed object, with instructions to mark points "A" and "B" on the curved line. The second sketch shows two larger views, one depicting a road with surrounding landscape, and another showing a silhouetted person on a horizon.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show where you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
