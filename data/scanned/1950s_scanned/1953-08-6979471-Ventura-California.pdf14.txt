The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a typed document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The document describes an observation of a light in the sky that was seen in Ventura, California on August 6, 1953.

The text in the document is as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED

The light was last seen at 9:17 pm when it appeared to the left and very rapidly moving away. The light was observed which may be attributable to a rocket flight. The light was observed in the sky for some time and the length of time the light was observed.

During all of the above, no sound whatever was heard that might have been associated with the light. The individuals who observed the light attempted to locate the source of the light but were unable to do so. The light was observed to be a bright light and their navigation lights were noted to be as bright as the main light. The angular velocity was observed to be so much slower than that of conventional jet aircraft.

No outline of any object was seen in connection with the light. The light appeared to be self-luminous. The individuals believe that the above is an accurate summary of their observation.
