"THE INDIVIDUAL REPORTED IS A SERIOUS, INTELLIGENT INDIVIDUAL WHO HOLDS
A RESPONSIBLE POSITION WITH A LARGE CORPORATION. HIS STATEMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS
ARE AS FOLLOWS:

ON 7 MAY 53 BETWEEN 2135 AND 2145 HOURS WITNESS WAS HAVING A NORMAL CONVERSATION
WITH SEVERAL OTHER INDIVIDUALS AS DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH 1. WITNESS NOTICED
IN THE NORTHWEST SKY A STRANGE OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE METAL AND HAD DEFINITE
SHAPE. OBJECT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING AT APPROXIMATELY 2000 FEET ALTITUDE.
OBJECT WAS MOVING IN A SEMI-CIRCULAR PATTERN AND PRODUCED WHAT APPEARED TO BE
A VERY INTENSE BLUE-WHITE LIGHT. OBJECT MADE NO SOUND AND LEFT NO TRAIL. ALTHOUGH
HE COULD NOT SEE THE AIRCRAFT, WITNESS BELIEVED IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME TYPE OF
JET AIRCRAFT. OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES. OBJECT WAS
SHAPED LIKE A SMALL BALLOON AND WAS APPROXIMATELY 3 3/4 POUNDS. WEIGHED APPROXIMATELY
2 POUNDS, APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 2 1/2 FEET IN DIAMETER, SPHERICAL IN

SHAPE, MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE WITH AN EVEN VELOCITY SIMILAR TO THAT OF WHEELS
ROLLING ON THE GROUND. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE ENTIRE OBJECT IF FOUND WOULD
POSSIBLY FIT INTO A SHOE BOX.
