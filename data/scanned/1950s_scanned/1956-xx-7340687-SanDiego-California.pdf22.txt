COMING OVER ATLANTIC OCEAN A TRANSPORT PLANE OF THE NAVY, CROSSING AT 19,0OO FEET, FLY

SOMETHING WAS SIGHTED. COMMANDER GEORGE BENTON WAS CHECKING THE INSTRU-

MENTS IN THE CABIN. HIS SIGHT SUDDENLY BECAME FIXED ON STRANGE LIGHTS OUTSIDE THE

CRAFT. THEY WERE COMING DIRECTLY AT HIS PLANE, ABOUT 1,OOO FEET AHEAD AND LEVEL.

"THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE SHIPS," SAID BENTON. HE CALLED RADIOMAN JOHN ERDMAN. "WIG-

GLEFIELD, GO CHECK THOSE LIGHTS." ERDMAN HURRIED TO THE COCKPIT. BENTON GAVE ORDERS

TO RADIO SILENCE. "WAKE UP THOSE OTHER CREWS," BENTON TOLD ERDMAN. "MAYBE SOMEBODY

CAN COPE IT OUT.**

IN A FEW MOMENTS, TWO OR THREE AIRMEN CROWDED INTO THE COCKPIT. BENTON FELT

LIKE HIS PILOT, BENTON AND THE MEN IN THE CABIN A GETTING A CLOSE-UP VIEW.

THE TRANSPORT BEGAN TO CIRCLE. THE STRANGE LIGHTS ABRUPTLY DIMMED. THEN SEVERAL COLORED

RINGS APPEARED AND BEGAN TO SPREAD OUT...ONE, BENTON NOTICED, SEEMED TO BE GROWING LARGER.

A LUMINOUS RING, HANGING ON THE SURFACE, IT WAS SOMETHING RUSHING UP TOWARD THE TRANS-

PORT.**WHAT THE DEVIL IS IT?" SAID MOONEY. "*COULD IT BE WRECKING BENTON'S CONSEL-

LATION OUT OF ITS TURN?* * ROLLED THE CONSTELLATION OUT OF ITS TURNING ORBIT* THE

GIANT DISC TILTED. IT SEEMED THEY COULD CATCH THEM IN SECONDS.

SUDDENLY THE GIANT DISC TILTED. ITS SPEED SHARPLY REDUCED. IT ANGLED ON PAST.

THE COMMANDER LET OUT HIS BREATH. HE LOOKED AT MOONEY'S WHITE FACE. HE SAW THE DISC

STOP AND HOVER, THEN DART AWAY IN A STRAIGHT LINE AT TREMENDOUS SPEED.
