1. The following is summarized from the Cleveland, Ohio, Detachment of this District Office, as forwarded for your information:

On 24 June 1954, a Cleveland, Ohio, citizen personally contacted the Cleveland Field Office, reporting the sighting of an unknown airborne object at approximately 2230 hours, 22 June 1954. He claimed to have observed the object for a period of approximately 10-15 minutes, and advised that at approximately 2220 hours, as he was standing on the corner of West 25th Street and Bridge Avenue, facing north, he saw an object come into his field of vision from the northwest.

He described the object as follows:
- Silvered, disc-shaped or elliptical in appearance, pointed at both ends.
- Gray in color (possibly bluish due to early dawn).
- The size of two C-47 houses combined.
- No protruding fins, wings or other appendages visible.
- The object hovered, or remained stationary, then suddenly moved out rapidly, and went out of sight in a matter of seconds.

Further investigative action is contemplated by your Cleveland Field Office.
