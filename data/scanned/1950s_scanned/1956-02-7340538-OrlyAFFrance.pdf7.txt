PARIS 23- (UP) - THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SOUGHT TODAY TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF A FLYING OBJECT WHICH CROSSED THE AIRFIELD AT ORLY AIRPORT AT SUCH A TREMENDOUS SPEED THAT THE CONTROL TOWER RADAR SCREENS COULD NOT TRACK IT. FRENCH ARMY OFFICIALS SAID THE OBJECT PASSED AT AN ESTIMATED 1,000 MILES AN HOUR, FASTER THAN SOUND, IN FULL VIEW OF THE INTERNATIIONAL AIRPORT'S RADAR EQUIPMENT. THEY SAID THE OBJECT WAS PICKED UP ON RADAR SCOPES AS IT ENTERED THE BUSY INTERNATIONAL AIRFIELD OUTSIDE PARIS AND THAT ITS SPEED WAS CALCULATED TO BE OVER 1,000 MILES AN HOUR. THE PHANTOM HAS NEVER BEEN EXPLAINED, THEY SAID. IT WAS SIGHTED BY TOWER AND FIELD CONTROL AND WAS CAUGHT BY RADAR FOR ABOUT TWO SECONDS. REPORTS SAID IT WAS SEEN AGAIN LATER IN THE EVENING OVER ANOTHER PART OF FRANCE. THE SPEED OF THE OBJECT WAS SO TREMENDOUS THAT THE RADAR EQUIPMENT WAS IN EXCELLENT WORKING CONDITION AND COULD NOT FOLLOW THE OBJECT WHICH FLASHED BY THEM IN LESS THAN TWO SECONDS. THE AREA IN WHICH THE RADAR PLACED THE "PHANTOM" AFTER TAKING OFF FROM THE AIRPORT CONTAINED LIGHTS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN PART OF THE OBJECT.
