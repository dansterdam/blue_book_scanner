The attached photographs were taken in June 1947 and represent a strange phenomena. One photograph was taken as it was travelling in the sky, and the other photograph was taken a few minutes before the second photograph, when the trail is visible. 

On 19 October 1950, the observer stated that this object was travelling in the same line of flight as the first object, and its distance appeared to be approximately over the hills in the background.

NOTE: Only one set of photographs is available.
