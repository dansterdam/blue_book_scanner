No Case (Information Only)
January 1957
Florida

January 1957-Florida- Donald Freestone, master mechanic, at C.O.S., reports that while testing weather radar equipment, he picked up a mysterious flying object that played a long "tag" with ships off Florida for several minutes before disappearing in space at 4,000 miles per hour. Freestone said the object has four or five times larger than any aircraft he had ever seen on radar at an altitude of 7,000 or 8,000 feet. Lt. Christ emphasized about 65 miles S E of Miami at an altitude of 7,000 or 8,000 feet. Because the object had a definite shape and moved on a definite course. Freestone doesn't think it was a freak return on the radarscope.

Sincerely,
