10. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING: Pilot of F-89 jet going into a turn saw what he described as a "ball of light" which streaked on the inside of his turn, and about 1/2 to 3/4 m.i. away. Object appeared to stay with him for awhile, then suddenly disappeared to another heading. He then lost it.
11. COMMENTS: Pilot's UFO report followed at almost same level when he went into turn. By heavy haze, object shaped (chick) contrail was lost. Conclusion: Probable weather phenomenon intersecting with a shadow (black dart) thrown on the contrail slightly behind him & to the left as he moved, which would appear at times with him. (Air work).
