The image contains three sketches, but no photographs. The first sketch shows a curved line with a point marked "A" and a curved line marked "B" to demonstrate how high an object was above the horizon (skyline) when it was first seen and last seen. The larger sketch below shows a landscape with a person standing on a road, and a smaller sketch in the bottom right corner shows a similar landscape but with a curved horizon line.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
