REPORT NR 6559-57 PAGE 1 OF 5 PAGES
SOME MATERIAL IS LIKE CLEAR FILM FALLING FROM THE SKY - WHEN A SPECIAL USAF OFFICER RELATED THESE OCCURRENCES HE COULD NOT BE ACCURATELY IDENTIFIED EXCEPT AS A RELIABLE WITNESS. IN FRANCE IT HAS BEEN CALLED "ANGEL'S HAIR" OR "GOSSAMER ANGELS" AND IN THIS CASE IT IS ALSO REPORTED IN FRANCE AND ITALY THAT SOME WAS FOUND FROZEN ON THE GROUND. THE SAKURASAMBA MIDDLE SCHOOL AT YOSHINAKAI IS MENTIONED AS THE LONGER STRANDS RANGED FROM 1/8 TO 5 INCHES AND WERE WHITE WITH A SILKY LUSTER LIKE SPUN GLASS. ACCORDING TO YOSHINAKAI LOCAL AND NATIONAL NEWSPAPER REPRESENTATIVES, MR. KINICHI ARAI, IT IS SAID THAT VERY FINE STRANDS OF THIS MATERIAL WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO BURN OR BREAK WERE COLLECTED BY SCHOOL CHILDREN AND TEACHERS. THE "ANGELS HAIR" WHICH IS SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE TO DECORATIVE THREAD FOR CHRISTMAS IS MENTIONED AS HAVING BEEN FOUND IN VARIOUS PLACES IN JAPAN BY TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. THE HAIR IS BURNED, IT LEAVES NO ASH.
THE MOST RECENT CASE IN JAPAN IS THAT OF MR. TATSUYA MATSUDA OF 14-2 MINAMI-SANJI, ASAKAWA-CHO, TOKYO, WHO NOTIFIED THE BRILLIANT WHITE MATERIAL FOUND ON HIS HOUSE TOP ON 1 NOV 57. HIS HOME IS LOCATED NEAR THE SHIROFUJI ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH NEITHER WINGS NOR TAIL. IT PROCEEDED FROM THE NORTHEAST AND SOME DISINTEGRATED OR DISAPPEARED WHEN IT CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE ATMOSPHERE. HIS REPORT TO MR. MATSUDA'S HOME WAS INVESTIGATED BY MEMBERS OF THE JAPAN ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY AND THE TOKYO ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY.
K. AT AROUND 1820 HOURS 1 NOV 57, A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT, HIROMI YOSHINAKAI OF OSAKA, OBSERVED A SMALL ROUNDED OBJECT 50-100 FT IN DIAMETER FLYING IN A DIRECTION FROM EAST TO WEST AT AN APPARENT DISCREPANCY IN SPEED AND MANEUVERABILITY. THE OBJECT EMITTED A BRILLIANT BLUISH-WHITE LIGHT AND MADE SEVERAL REVERSALS IN DIRECTION PER SECOND AT ESTIMATED SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 2,000 MPH. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE OBJECT DISAPPEARED TO THE NORTHEAST. CHIEF OF THE TOKYO ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY IS QUOTED AS SAYING: "THE FACT THAT YOSHINAKAI'S OBSERVATION IS CORROBORATED BY OTHER RELIABLE WITNESSES, CAREFUL OBSERVATION IS NEEDED SINCE AIRCRAFT BALLOONS AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS CANNOT BE EXCLUDED."
COMMENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICERS

S. All information pertaining to meteors is forwarded to the Meteor Section of the Geophysical Research Division (GRD) at Cambridge, Mass. Data on aerial phenomena and unidentified objects are sent to the UFOB SECTION (GRA) via Air Intelligence (AFOACI) at Wright-Patterson AFB. This society publishes monthly on matters concerning the members. Conclusions and data on such reports include physical measurements, as much detail as possible, including any effects on personnel or damage to property. The UGIB Research Group (USAF WAYU GROUP HONJB) maintains its files on reports of inexplicable aerial phenomena and makes a quarterly report on their studies and conclusions. This is always a first-class source in any investigation of this type.
