There is no photograph present in the provided image. The image appears to be a scanned document containing a written report of a sighting of an unidentified aerial object on April 29, 1952 near Coldwater, Ohio.

Report of sighting:
At 0915 on 30 April 1952, a Mr. F. of Coldwater, Ohio, called ATIC. He reported that at 1930 LHE on 29 April he and three other people observed an unidentified aerial object.

The object was first seen directly overhead. It drifted NJ and disappeared in the distance. It was at an angle of elevation of about 30Â° when it disappeared.

The object appeared to be disc shaped "tending on edge". It was the color of "cherry red hot iron". It appeared to be about 1/3 the size of a full moon. The source thought that it was drifting faster than a balloon could drift.

Dayton winds were:
NE 20,000
NE 27,000 
NE 35,000
NE 45,000
N 55,000

Selfridge winds were:
NE 40,000 47
N 45,000 27
NW 50,000 17

Layton balloon drifted S - 2100'. Winds shifting to S. Could have been drifting North. They were not sure of definite burst.

Selfridge last report was 67,000' but no record at HQ ATS of a definite burst. Could have been 'piballs' which are very difficult to track.
