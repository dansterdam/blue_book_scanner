The image does not contain any photographs, only handwritten text on what appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document.

Text from the document:

THE OBJECT AS OBSERVED WAS SHAPED LIKE A BROAD TRIANGLE AND WAS OF A FLAMING OR INCANDESCENT COLOR. IT WAS OBSERVED FOR 10 TO 15 SECONDS AND THEN APPEARED TO SPLIT INTO 3 SEPARATE OBJECTS WHICH FLEW AWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED IN AN ARC-STATIC ABOUT. OVER THE NOISE BOOM AND EXTREME VELOCITY OF THE OBJECTS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT ANY SOUND COMING FROM THEM. ON SOME OCCASIONS IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE OBJECTS WERE TRAVELING IN EXCESS OF 1000 MILES PER HOUR AND THAT THEY WERE HIGHLY MANEUVERABLE. THEIR COURSE AND SPEED WERE ERRATIC AND GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL.
