The image appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. It does not contain any photographs, but rather includes text describing various codes and data fields used in the document.

Code 1. GENERAL 
a. These cards (and the corresponding WORK SHEETS) contain data from several sources. Columns referenced to the U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet Form 44 must have at least one entry. If no data are available for any column, the Y (or 12 punch) should be used.
b. Ranges 22, 23, 25, 26, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, and 51 are calculated from data appearing in the U.S. Air Force Technical Information Sheet (Form A). If the basic data for these calculations are not available, the appropriate columns should be left blank.
c. If a number in any column is used to enter data, then X (or 11 punch) qualifies the data as indicated in the Code for the specific column.
