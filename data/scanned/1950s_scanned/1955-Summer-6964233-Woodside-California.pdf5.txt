The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a typed document with handwritten text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I have extracted the following text from the document:

34. Date you completed this questionnaire: 7 / 11 / 55
35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of the questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting. The object was bigger than my car, it was silvery and round. It seemed to be hovering fairly low. I called my wife to come out and see it as it was certainly an unidentified flying object. We watched it for around three minutes till it went behind some trees. I would like to know what it was. I only wish I could have got a better look at it. It seemed very solid and quite unlike anything I have seen before. I have not spotted any such object since and I am quite certain that what I saw was not of any conventional nature.
