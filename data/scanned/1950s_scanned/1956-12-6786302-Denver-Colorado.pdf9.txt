Baltimore, Maryland 

Case 277, Baltimore, Md. Dec. 3, 1956--Quoting the Baltimore Sun, "Two men reported they saw a flying object streak away from a large transport plane while they were standing at Charles and Centre Streets. Curvin A. Ball and Robert Bryant, guards at the Walters Art Gallery, said, 'We thought at first the tail of a section of a plane had broken loose. But then the plane reversed it, and we saw the thing.' They said the object was 'flat, oval-shaped and very bright.' It appeared to be spinning counterclockwise. They said they watched it until it disappeared behind a building..."
