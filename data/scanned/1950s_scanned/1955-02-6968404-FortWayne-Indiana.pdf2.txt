About 7:30 PM EST on 2-9-55 my wife and I observed three bright lights in the sky. These lights appeared to be hovering in one spot, and then suddenly one of the lights took off at a terrific speed, made a sharp turn and disappeared from sight. The other two lights remained hovering in the same spot. They appeared to be round in shape, about the size of a dime held at arm's length, and were a very bright white light, not blinking. They would remain stationary for a few minutes and then start moving around in various directions, but would return to the same spot. They were at an estimated altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet. The weather was clear, and the lights were clearly visible to the naked eye. This observation lasted approximately 15 to 20 minutes. The moving light that took off accelerated so rapidly that it disappeared from sight instantly. My wife and I both observed this sighting."
