September 18, 1963

Dear Sir,

This letter is in reply to your letter of September 9, 1963, concerning "Flying Saucers".

We are enclosing two brochures on unidentified aerial phenomena including some sightings over the United States.

We hope they will be of interest to you.

The five lights over Port Huron which you referred to in your letter were probably related to the "Air Force as a B-47 air refueling mission which was taking place in that area at that time.

Sincerely,

MAJOR H. J. JACKS
