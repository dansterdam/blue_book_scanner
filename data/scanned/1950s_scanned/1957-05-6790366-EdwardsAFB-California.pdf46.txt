The image does not contain a photograph, but rather three sketches or drawings. The first sketch shows the path of a high object above the horizon, and instructs the viewer to place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was. The second and third sketches appear to be different perspectives or illustrations of an unidentified object in the sky.

Transcription of the text in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketches as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
