AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FTR 3-8, 46024 ATSS
I. SOURCE:
Address: Miss Lois Parks, Traverse City, Michigan
Age: 28 years
Occupation: Engineer with Continental Aircraft
Education: College Graduate
Qualifications: Pilot in WWII, still flies light aircraft.

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE is considered absolutely reliable by all persons interviewed, as well as this investigator. Probably one of the most reliable reports received to date regarding the sightings.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: "If had seen this bright object in the sky not identified, it would have normally have been disregarded as just a freak cloud formation or something of that nature. When I sighted closely, I could hear a sound like that of a jet. There was no tail, no wings, no trail, and no evidence of any method of propulsion. It was stationary, and disappeared completely after a period of 15-20 seconds."

The object was sighted over Lake Leelanau at the time which accounts for the disappearance in the distance and the relative silence of any noises which might have been evident at a closer range. The shape was circular, about 30-35 feet in diameter, and glowed with a bright yellow-white light. The witness watched it from a distance of about 1 mile, and it appeared to be about 1000 feet in altitude. It was seen by this witness and the police chief of Traverse City, Michigan.
