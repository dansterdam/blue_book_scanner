The writer mentions having a "matter which I am sure is worthy of bringing to your attention" and provides some details about the sightings, including attaching a handwritten copy of an "Intelligence Information Report" and a blank form. The writer also expresses a desire to have the information forwarded to the Air Force.

Dear Sir:
I have a matter which I am sure is worthy of bringing to your attention. However, because of the possibility of subversive activity, I am reporting it to you. 

On MAY 17th, 1956, a friend and I sighted approximately 20 flying objects which we believe were not spectacular phenomena. There was a short article about these objects in the local paper. On or about JULY 2nd, 1956, I was walking talking with a civilian flying saucer intelligence (handwritten copy enclosed)  and a blank form to be filled out. I thought about having sent the form back for several days. Then I decided that if a civilian organization would want this information, I should also send it to the Air Force.

I don't have a form to fill out but I have described the circumstances and details of the way the objects appeared in the sky and I have enclosed the handwritten copy of the Intelligence Information Report.

I hope that this information may be of use to you.

Sincerely,
[Redacted]

The letter at the bottom states "This little incident and another are known to the possibility that some one is taking upon himself the responsibility for some of these sightings as a study or hobby, this seems plausible."
