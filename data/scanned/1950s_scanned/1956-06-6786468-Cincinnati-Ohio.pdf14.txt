The image shows a hand-drawn sketch of an object in the sky above the horizon. The sketch depicts an object that appears to be some kind of aerial vehicle or unidentified flying object (UFO). The object has a curved, crescent-shaped form with protrusions or rays emanating from it. The text instructions ask the viewer to imagine that the object was first seen high above the horizon (skyline) and then place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when you first saw it, and then place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was when you last saw it.

Now, acting as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.
