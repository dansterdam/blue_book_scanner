INTERVIEWS WITH ASTRONOMERS

There follows a simple narrative of the interviews, after which the opinions and advice of the astronomers will be summarized.

Astronomer A has never made any sightings and knows of none in his immediate acquaintance who have.

Astronomer B has made sightings of things which people would call "flying saucers" but hasn't seen anything that he couldn't explain. He has seen birds at night flying in formation illuminated by city lights, but probably not bright enough to have been photographed because they were traveling "pretty fast". Astronomer B wonders if some of the sightings are not due to Navy secret weapons, since only the Navy has officially said nothing about flying saucers. Astronomer B was quite outspoken and feels that past methods of handling the subject have been "stupid". He feels pilots should not be hushed up, and that secrecy only whets the public appetite.

Astronomer C has made no sightings, and is quite reluctant to discuss the subject. It is evident that he regards it as a fairly silly proceeding and subject. Difficult to bring the conversation around to the subject.

Astronomer D has made no such sightings and does not know any associate who has. He is fairly sympathetic in the matter and appears open-minded on the subject.

Astronomer E has made no sightings, but heard the great Seattle meteorite of May 11 at 1:30 a.m. Apparently, he is not much interested in the subject.
