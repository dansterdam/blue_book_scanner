Distortions due to distance, atmospheric conditions, and various optical phenomena can make the identification of the shape reported in the past would appear to be unidentifiable in terms of familiar objects, but the many instances could have been reflections from conventional objects viewed under unusual conditions. Light and shadow, photographic tendistortions, especially when objects are viewed at great distances and in varying degrees of gathering darkness.
