In 6 seconds they covered an arc. The visibility I had was of 45 degrees.

They flew in formation, 5 together and 2 to the right, a little ahead.

Moonless night completely clear.

Silent flight with no wake. I did not notice any increase in speed, any rotation or gyration.

Color of wood, it seemed to have a front part, 2 dark spots and more to the center a strip that went across, as shown.

Seen from below, exactly vertical:

7 Flying objects -- type: flying saucer.

Second time in 10 years that I have had the opportunity of seeing flying saucers.

I firmly believe in the necessity of pooling all information on flying saucers. They have been seen in many countries and nothing has been done about it, they still think that people who have seen them are crazy. We have something that the whole world has to investigate to give a small light on all this. I swear this is the truth! My eyes have not betrayed me. I am not the kind of person that gets carried away by strange and unusual things; I am qualified to make out anything in the air that would cross my eyes. I have a flying license and I am an instructor in sailplane flying. I am 40 years of age and have 25 years of experience on aviation matters.
