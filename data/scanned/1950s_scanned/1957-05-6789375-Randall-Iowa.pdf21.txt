British Radar Sighting

BRITISH ISLES REVISITED

(More information on the British radar sightings of Apr. 6)

London, Evening News, April 6:
"It was never seen by the naked eye, but its position and speed were logged, clocked, and double-checked. Wing-Commander Walter Whitworth, CO., at the RAF weather radar station nearest to Lyme, was contacted by the Air Ministry to say what he knew of the object. He was allowed to break his silence, but said nothing. He took the position, checked and clocked again and went to the other stations. But by this time quite a number of people were in on the game.

"The radar sets began tracking the object, and constantly confirmed it was there. It was a clear object against a building return left on for comparison. A few minutes later a signal appeared on both screens. Each set had a duplicate, a third being switched on; they too, recorded the object."

London News Chronicle, April 6:
"Wing-Commander Whitworth was issued to the radar operators, James Foley and John Bloskey, both of Stranraer, who picked up the object on their screens."
