Air Intelligence Information Report
IR-52
8 August 1952

The text in the document is as follows:

LT KEARNEY, LIEUT FORT

1. In accordance with existing instructions, the following information is submitted:

SUMMARY OF SIGHTING:
On 6 August 1952, the control tower operator at CRTC Ft. Custer, Michigan, observed a "clear sky" moving in a westerly direction at a speed of "1,000 miles per hour" for 2 to 3 seconds. This was reported to be high altitude and the object was observed in the daytime. There were no sound or trail effects noted. 

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE OBSERVATION:
The observer, a pilot with several years experience, stated that the object was "disc-shaped", silver in color, and had no wings or tail. It was very small in size and appeared to be a solid object. This officer is considered reliable and his report has been checked closely. No other witnesses were available.

EVALUATION:
The presence of the object described, as reported, coincides with published information on similar flying objects. It is this agency's belief that the reported sighting represents an actual phenomena and is not an illusion or misinterpretation of a known object. However, the source of these flying objects is indeterminate at this time. Such reports merit close study and evaluation.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is recommended that this report be forwarded to the proper authorities for further study and analysis. No further action is contemplated at this station.
