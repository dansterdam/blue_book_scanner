15 August 1952

A/2c 24665 2570 hours, on the evening of 14 August 1952, I and a friend observed a light that seemed to be moving in the sky. The light was quite bright and seemed to us to be much larger than a star. We watched it for approximately 10 minutes and it seemed to move about in the sky. It would move up, down, and sideways in a jerky motion. At times it seemed to hover and then move rapidly across the sky. To the best of my recollection, it was observed in a northwest direction from my position. The light seemed to have a halo or glow around it. After calling to someone else to observe it, it suddenly disappeared from sight. I reported the incident to the duty officer and was instructed to report it to the intelligence officer the following day.

At the time of the sighting the sky was clear and the object could easily be seen. It did not seem to be a star, planet, or an aircraft. I had the (1) scope of less at approximately 1530.
