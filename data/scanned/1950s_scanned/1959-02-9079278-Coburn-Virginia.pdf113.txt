DRAFT  30 NOVEMBER 1959

1. Background.
a. On Wednesday, 27 May 1959, Major Tacker of SAFIS-3 called ARGIN-4E16
and informed Major Friend that Congressman Jennings had contacted SAFIS and
requested information concerning an UFO sighting in Wise-Coeburg, Virginia
area. A check was made of the UFO files and it was found that no reports
had been received from the Wise-Coeburg area. Hqs., 1006th AISS was contacted
and was requested to investigate these sightings. The only available infor-
mation was that received via telephone and newspaper articles received from
Major Tacker. The information in the newspaper articles indicated a large
number of residents in the Wise-Coeburg, Va. area sighted several strange
lights and found strips of aluminum foil on the mountains in the area. (See T.D.)
b. Detachment 8, 1006th AISS was directed to investigate the subject
UFO sightings and contacted ARGIN-4E16. Due to the fact the detachment was
short of personnel, T/Sgt Bolieu of ARGIN-4E16 was directed to assist in
the investigation. Friday, 5 June 1959, T/Sgt Bolieu and A/1c Primacombe 
of Det 8, 1006th AISS departed Wright-Patterson AFB for Wise-Coeburg, Va
area and arrived at Wise, Va. at 2400 on same day.

(1) Made an appointment with the Wise County Sheriff for 1315.
The county sheriff, Mrs. __, who is also a waitress, had
very little information concerning the sightings as she had not seen the
objects herself. She stated that she had never heard of a mountain until 
reports of subject sightings reached her.
