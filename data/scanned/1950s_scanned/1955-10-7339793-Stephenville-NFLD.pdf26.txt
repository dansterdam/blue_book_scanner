Space Experts Predict Men Will Land on Moon by 2000
COPENHAGEN, Aug. 3 (/P) - Space experts said today that medical obstacles to sustained absolutely necessary for men to travel to the moon and return safely have been overcome.
Dr. Hoyle, professor of astronomy at Cambridge University, told newsmen that rocket-propelled vehicles could land men on the moon by the year 2000 A.D.
"We have the technical know-how to do it," he said, "and the only real obstacle is the heavy cost."
Mr. Durant of Lexington, Mass., a space scientist, said that the next step appears to be a manned artificial satellite, which could serve as stepping stones to the moon.
"One way to travel yet, and one of the most obvious, is to put up a space platform, a space station, as a stepstone from which we can launch to the moon and return, with the greatest chance of success," he said.
Moon Plans For Air Force
The space experts expressed belief that the United States Air Force is working on plans for a possible moon landing. The Air Force declined to comment on the statement.
