CRAIG W. HEWARD LETTER

In the first instance the object appeared to be headed in a horizontal flight before the investigator could observe. It then made a vertical ascent at such a tremendous rate of speed that the observer was unable to keep it in sight very long as it passed out of his vision behind clouds. The sighting was at approximately 6:15 PM CST on 28 July 1953 in the vicinity of Satsuma, Alabama. The object itself appeared to be round and silvery in color, and the observer stated that a momentary flash of light was observed from the object which gave the appearance of a 'mirror-like' reflection just prior to its vertical ascent and disappearance. No engine or exhaust was observed, and the object made no sound. The observer, although startled by the unexpected appearance and rapid disappearance of the object, remained calm and collected his thoughts during the brief observation period. He is a mature and intelligent person, and his report is considered credible.
