STATEMENT

On the morning of 4 December 1952, I AIC Clarence C. I, was on duty as USAF interceptor controller on the 727th AC&W Squadron. I was controlling a jet interceptor aircraft which was attempting to intercept a high speed object. I only saw it for one long pass, when it stopped for approximately one minute, then came directly back in the path it was moving, and faded. This track was first picked up at 0340 by out station Thomas who was at the scope. It was around seventy miles from our station.
