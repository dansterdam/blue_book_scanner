COMMENTS OF APPROVING OFFICER:
The preceding draw is a graphic rendition of a possible T-47 target. As such, the apparent color and altitude are consistent with the visual sighting described. No contrails or other visible indications of aircraft characteristics were observed. However, the possibility of a very high altitude aircraft or satellite cannot be eliminated.
