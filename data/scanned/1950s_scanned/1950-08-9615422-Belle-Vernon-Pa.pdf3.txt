Dear Sir:

On August 22nd I filmed a strangely moving aircraft. It is now in the possession on August 23rd. I visited the hangar about the flying saucer, and you wanted information about it. What I have told you is the truth, I cannot tell anymore than that. If you want any more information about it you will have to contact me.

Sincerely,
