DESCRIPTION OF T-6 PILOT
ON 8 DECEMBER 1952 AT 2302Z WHILE FLYING A T-6 AIRCRAFT AT 2,800 FEET IN THE VICINITY OF CAR-BOUN, MAINE, I OBSERVED A BRIGHT LIGHT TO THE WEST THAT SHORTLY AFTER REMAINED STATIONARY AND THEN APPARENTLY ACCELERATED TO AN EXTREMELY HIGH SPEED IN THE DIRECTION OF CARIBOU, MAINE. THE LIGHT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 1 TO 2 MILES HIGH AND I DID CONTACT IT. THEN CONTACTED THE CONTROL TOWER AND THEY STATED THAT THEY ALSO OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT MOVING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED FROM THE CITY OF CARIBOU. I FLEW ABOUT FORTY (40) MILES IN THE DIRECTION OF THE LIGHT AND THEN LOST CONTACT WITH IT.
I HAVE NO IDEA OF THE SIZE, SHAPE, OR ALTITUDE OF THE OBJECT EXCEPT THAT IT APPEARED ON THE HORIZON AND MOVED RAPIDLY. I CANNOT ATTRIBUTE ANY POWERED CONTROLLED MOVEMENT TO IT AS IT WAS MOVING TOO FAST FOR A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT.
