The image contains three sketches. The top sketch shows a curved line with a shape resembling an explosion or fireworks emerging from the horizon. The instructions ask the viewer to imagine that this is an object and to indicate how high it was above the horizon.

The middle sketch shows a road or path with buildings or structures on the sides, as if viewed from the perspective of someone standing on the path.

The bottom sketch shows a more distant view, with a curved horizon and a silhouetted figure in the foreground.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place on "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you lost sight of it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
