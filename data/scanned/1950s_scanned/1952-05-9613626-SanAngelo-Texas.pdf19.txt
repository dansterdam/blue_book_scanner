On may 19, 1952 at 2005 C.S.T. while flying southwest of San Angelo, Texas
at an altitude of 18,000 feet, seven bright objects were observed in the west
in a vertical formation. There appeared to be no apparent movement for the first
15 minutes, then they appeared to be sending off vapor trails in a swirling
motion, different from any vapor trails I've observed from high flying aircraft.
After the vapor trails drifted off no objects were in sight. I took six
pictures of this with my personal camera (35mm). The film is now being developed.
