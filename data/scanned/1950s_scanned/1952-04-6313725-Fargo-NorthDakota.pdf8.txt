1. In compliance with ADCI 200-1, dated 11 April 1952, the following information on report of unconventional airborne objects dated 27 April 1952, is respectfully submitted:

2. The information below was gathered by the undersigned and observed first hand, rather than as was submitted in report 27 April 1952.

a. The airborne objects referred to as discs by several citizens of Moorhead, Minnesota and Fargo, North Dakota, traveling high, very fast, bright red and orange color, seen on or about 25 April 1952, have turned out to be normal lights.

b. To satisfy his own curiosity, the undersigned proceeded to the top of the First floor at the City of Fargo, North Dakota, about 2030 hours on 28 April 1952, equipped with binoculars, high speed camera, and recorded the variations in flights.

c. On or about 2115 hours several tall tanks passed over, high fast, and bright. Faint flashing lights near the tanks was also noted. Other aircraft of various types followed, also illuminated and were positively identified by checking silhouettes with various flight manuals.

The strange illumination at first noted was picked up by the search lights used on the ground level, lending a further strange appearance to the objects. Lighting glare, the difference in both of these factors caused the subjects to show up more closely by both of these factors. The undersigned concluded the strange illumination thus causing the strange appearance.
