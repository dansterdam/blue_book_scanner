The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a typed statement describing an observation of an unidentified object in the sky on the night of February 27, 1953. The text describes the object as moving rapidly and then stopping, and then slowly moving back the way it came, with the most amazing thing being the steady, large light and its rapid movement.

STATEMENT

On the night of 27 February 1953 I saw an unidentified object in the sky. It seemed to be extremely high with a steady glow. At first it was about the size of a dime and I saw it for about two or three seconds. Then it seemed to shoot off to the left at a terrific speed and was out of sight in an instant. Then it seemed to shoot back and hang motionless for a couple of seconds and then seemed to shoot off again and was gone. This thing gave me the impression of being controlled, but the most amazing thing was the steady large light and the rapid movements.
