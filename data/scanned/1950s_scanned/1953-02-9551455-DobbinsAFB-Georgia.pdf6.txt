Marines Say Jet Pilot Chased Glowing Object
CHERRY POINT, N.C., Feb. 12 (AP). - The Marines at the Cherry Point Marine Air Station tonight reported that a Navy jet pilot chased a mysterious glowing object over the Atlantic Ocean for about 20 minutes.
A spokesman said the Norfolk Navy Air Station confirmed the report, but did not specify what the object was. A Navy spokesman said the pilot chased the object some 10 miles out over the ocean. The pilot said the object was about 10 feet in diameter and gave off a bright glowing light.
The spokesman said the pilot gave up the chase because the object "pulled away" from him at a speed he estimated at between 500 and 600 miles per hour. Several other Navy and Marine pilots also saw the object, which suddenly disappeared, the spokesman said.
A helicopter spotted the mysterious object again later and attempted to close in on it, but it disappeared before the helicopter could get close enough for a better look.
The spokesman said searchlight squadrons failed to make contact with the radar.
