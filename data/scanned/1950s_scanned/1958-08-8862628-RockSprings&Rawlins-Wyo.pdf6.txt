The balloons were not identified immediately. The weather balloons are filled with helium or hot air, which has an odor.
As for the boom, the Strategic Air Command at Omaha said it had no planes or missiles in that area at the time of the explosion. The Pentagon had no operational missile units in the Utah area.
The balloons, of clear plastic, were about four feet long and 18 inches in diameter. They carried no markings or instruments.
An Air National Guard unit in Southern California and New Mexico - said there was no missile firing during yesterday.
The balloons caused a stir. Some people thought they saw planes, but they did not resemble any known aircraft. The noise was described as a "sonic boom," a violent explosion sound caused by any object traveling faster than sound.
