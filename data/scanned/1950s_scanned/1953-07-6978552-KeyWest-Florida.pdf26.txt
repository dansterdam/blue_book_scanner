The image contains three sketches depicting different perspectives of an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The first sketch shows a curved line representing the horizon, with a shape above it to illustrate how high the object was above the horizon when the witness first saw it.

The second and third sketches provide a larger view of the object's position relative to the observer. The second sketch shows the object's position when the witness first saw it, and the third sketch is a smaller example of how the larger sketch could be completed to show the full extent of the object's position.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Rather to scale the sketch as an example of how it could complete the larger sketch.
