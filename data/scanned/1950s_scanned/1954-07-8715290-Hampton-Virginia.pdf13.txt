Dear Sir:

I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. J. Edgar Hoover in which he tells me that he has referred my letter to him to your office. This letter is regarding a man of my acquaintance by name of *********** of Mt. View, Missouri. He claims to have been taken to Washington D. C. for interrogation concerning a ride he allegedly took in a flying saucer to Venus. He claims to have letters from the Air Force verifying his story, and is selling books on the strength of this, giving his true experiences. Would you please refer to my letter to Mr. Hoover and answer any questions concerning this man. If he is lying about this, and using the Air Force or FBI to verify it, then he is using the mails to defraud it seems. He says you have the negative to a picture he took of these flying saucers.
I appreciate your consideration. This is of great interest to me.
Yours truly,
/s/
