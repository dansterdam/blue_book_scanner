There does not appear to be any photograph or image on this page of the old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The page consists entirely of text with questions and instructions.

Here is the text from the document:

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. If that type material would you make it? How large could it be, and what shape would it have? Describe in your own words a common object or objects which when placed up in the sky would give the same appearance as the object which you saw.
