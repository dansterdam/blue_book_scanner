Flight 2-B, 4502d AISS

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer (Contd):

The preparing officer feels that the object was probably a heavenly body (star or planet) and that there might have been some error in giving its exact flight path. This hypothesis is based upon the many characteristics associated with stars and planets that were possessed by the object. The fact that it was observed in the exact orbit on the second night tends to lend additional weight to this hypothesis. The third and fourth nights were overcast and no observations were possible.

COMMENTS OF Approving Officer:

1. Concur with the opinion of the Preparing Officer that this sighting was astronomical in nature. It is further submitted that this sighting was generated by the star Sirius. In addition to the data contained on the preceding pages the following is given in support of the above hypothesis:

a. At the time of the sighting Sirius was located at the same position as the UFOB.

b. Sirius has a magnitude of -1.6 and frequently appears to radiate an array of brilliant colors, notably red, blue, and green.

c. The object was reported on 5, 6, and 9 March 1956. In all three reports the object was seen at the same time and in the same relative position.

2. In view of the persisting nature of the object, the colors viewed and the fact that Sirius was located in the same relative position as the UFOB, it is the opinion of this headquarters that the sighting was a misinterpretation of the star Sirius.
