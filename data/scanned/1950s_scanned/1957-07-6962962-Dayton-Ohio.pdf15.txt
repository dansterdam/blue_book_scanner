The image contains a map of Brazil, but does not contain any photographs. I will now proceed to extract all the text from the document:

SEEN FROM THE AIR

Captain Paulo Ramos Ribeiro of Cruzeiro do Sul Airlines has sent us an account of the sighting over the South Atlantic on 13 July 1957. The object observed over the ocean was luminous and was noticed by the crew at 17:50-6 o'clock GMT) we were flying the Convair-600, 12,000 meters high, magnetic heading 239, near Rio Doc., about 100 km from the coast, when we suddenly observed a luminous object crossing our attention to a strange light.

"The light was white and its illumination was
and it appeared to be
had seen before. It flew very rapidly in almost a straight line, at an estimated 50 kilometers from us.
It made a 90 degree turn, very rapidly, and continued
towards the coast. At the moment it changed its course, we were able to clearly see that it was some sort of disc, shaped something like that which is 
shown on the map below. Although it were made of aluminum.

"There was no noise or trail and the white luminance seemed to be emanating from it. It could be compared to the water being stirred by a moving motor-boat - just a sort of luminous, hazy trail behind the body of it. What we saw was a luminous, hazy disc showing blue and green colors changing in quick succession. The speed was tremendous and no sound was audible at the time."
