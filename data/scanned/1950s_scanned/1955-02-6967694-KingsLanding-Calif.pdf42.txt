TEXT TRANSCRIPTION:

was rated and turned to duty as a radio operator battalion technician.

Subsequently, I was a Corporal and a radio Chief of Section. Radio Chief of Section ft through the Guadalcanal campaign. Spent 105 days in action there, and I do mean action. In the American! Division, particular Field Artillery Battalion was attached to the First Lave Division. Subsequently, I suffered five years of malaria.

And in 1942 I made arrangements to transfer to the Air Force, the Army Air Force it was at that time, and install the radio gear in P-38 fighters and see that all their equipment in the electrical line was ship-shape. But General Patch, who was my division commander at the time, later led the 7th army in Europe, beat the transfer down, and generally I was out maneuvered until I was on a boat, so that is about as close as I xxxx ever came to being a member of the Air Force.

My experience as a pilot has been limited. I have about 245 hours log time. Most of that time we spend at flying and not joy riding. Flying was something I always wanted to learn and I eventually learned it on my own. In handling a light aircraft, I can do pretty well. I have landed mud flaps, chopped out 3 propellers, made a number of emergency landings and a few things like this. But getting back, this is just all a little background getting back to the starting of this is just all a little background.
