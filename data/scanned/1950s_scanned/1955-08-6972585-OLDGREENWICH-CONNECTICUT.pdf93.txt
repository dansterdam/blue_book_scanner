Q - How long do you think it'll be before we find out definitely where the saucers come from?
A - I think that this year we may find out more about these things than we ever before, because its possible to judge that the frequency of saucer sightings is greatest in the years when we are closest to the planet Mars. And September 7th of this year, when we're closer to Mars than we've been in many years. The 90 days after that will be a very significant period.

You know, they might decide that we're so stupid and so far beneath them
that we're hopeless, and that we aren't worth all the trouble that we might
cause them.
Q - But would they just go away and act as if we never existed? 
A - I can give you a comparable situation. Suppose you had a big plane over the jungle, and you saw a bunch of savages down there beating each other's brains out with clubs. You might circle around and watch them do it, but you really wouldn't have any ambition to land and join in. And that may be the position we have reached in culture, as compared with some of these civilizations that send us flying saucers.
