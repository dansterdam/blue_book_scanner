AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Unidentified Aircraft Sighted Between Midway Island and Japan
3 March 1952

SUMMARY: (Censored) the unidentified aircraft was observed at an altitude of approximately 9,500 feet, heading 120°, speed approximately 200 mph. The unidentified aircraft flew from 1,000 feet to the right of the MATS aircraft and turned across its course, taking up a course of 360°.

The pilot and navigator of the MATS aircraft observed the unidentified aircraft and made an attempt to communicate with the unidentified aircraft, but no attempt to communicate with the unidentified aircraft was successful. The Intelligence Officer, Pacific Division, MATS stated that further check into the incident was unnecessary at the time of the writing as it is believed that MATS aircraft were not the targets of the unidentified aircraft.

Comments of Reporting Officer: The weather reconnaissance tracks in the Pacific area were checked at Hq. MATS. None of the reconnaissance flights were in the vicinity at the time the unidentified aircraft was being flown on a USAF weather reconnaissance mission can be discounted.
