This image contains two sketches that appear to be part of an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

The first sketch shows a curved line with the instructions to place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon when the observer first saw it, and a "B" on the same curved line to show the object's position when the observer last saw it.

The second sketch contains two larger sketches. The one on the left shows a straight road or path with buildings or structures on either side, which the instructions indicate represents the "straight up" position of the object. The smaller sketch on the right shows a more distant landscape view.

Transcribed text from the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
