Project Blue Book Text:
The clear night, calm sea. The object was a lighted round mass about twice the size of a 1 moon - had uneven, flickering light and a long tail, 10 to 15 times the diameter of the object, pointing north. Object moved in horizontal direction, dipped down, then arced back up. It was airborne for about 30 seconds. Witness was an experienced observer and has observed the planets and known aerial phenomena. This is an unusual report which deserves further investigation.
