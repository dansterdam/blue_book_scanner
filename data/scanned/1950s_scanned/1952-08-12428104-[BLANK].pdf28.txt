The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, describing the investigation of a UFO sighting.

ATIC is staffed with highly-qualified engineers and scientists. The Center also has an "on-call" contract with scientists and engineers representing such fields as nuclear physics, psychology, mathematics, and chemistry. The investigating officer in this case asked the consulting astronomer for Project Blue Book to determine whether an astronomical body could have caused the sighting. The astronomer concluded that no astronomical body which could have been seen in daylight had been in the portion of the sky where the object had been seen. Venus, a previous offender, had been too near the sun to have been seen.

While the astronomer was checking, the officer began his study of balloons, a likely possibility for any object that remains stationary for from five to 60 minutes. He knew that he would be able to check this possibility with reasonable accuracy. "Pilball" balloons that are not tracked are seldom reported as UAOs, because of their small size. Large, instrument-carrying balloons are tracked.

The officer checked his map (see page 33) of U.S. locations where such balloons are launched. He wired stations near Benson AFB asking whether they had a balloon in the air at the time, and, if so, the general path the balloon took, the bearing from the station, and the altitude at which it had burst. His replies were negative, except from Davis-Monthan AFB, at Tucson, which mentioned a balloon that had traveled southeast of Tucson, had reached an altitude, then had risen vertically until it had burst at (time).
