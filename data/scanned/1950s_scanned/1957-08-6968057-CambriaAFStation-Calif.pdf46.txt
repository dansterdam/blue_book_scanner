Dear Major Keyhoe:  

Your letter of 27 August 1957 addressed to the Senior Public Information Officer, Air Force, Denver, concerning information related to the crash of an F-89D aircraft near Cambria, California on 16 August 1957, had been referred to this office.  

Press releases, as you requested, are forwarded as attachments to this letter. Information relating to this aircraft accident has been included.  

On the night of 16 August 1957, First Lieutenant Raj H. Bhatt, U.S. Air Force, was piloting an F-89D aircraft of the 317th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Oxnard Air Force Base, California, when the aircraft crashed at Cambria, California. The pilot apparently had difficulty in maintaining complete control of the aircraft prior to the crash. The pilot was killed in the crash.
