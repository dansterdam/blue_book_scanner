PIO INFORMATION:

15 Jul 53 Project Blue Book received a phone call from Damon Runyon, Jr., reporter for the New York Journal American. He stated that he had received some information concerning some new Air Force flare equipment which has a 1 million candle power light intensity and he is attempting to determine if there may be a correlation between this type of flare and the 19 Aug 52 Sonny DeSeverger sighting.

Since Project Blue Book is not acquainted with this flare, Mr. Runyon asked for general information on Project Blue Book which was supplied by Lt R. M. Olsson. His paper carried a story in late 1952 on the DeSevergers sighting and this was a follow-up. Project Blue Book will ask to AFDC about the subject flare, where it is being tested, its visibility capabilities, and, in general, about any tests regarding guided missiles, flares, and any other equipment which might have been responsible for a "flying saucer" report.
