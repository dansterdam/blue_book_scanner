1. The Honorable Senator, in a letter written to the Denver Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, dated 5 December 1955, stated that on about 25 November 1955 he had seen an unidentified object in the vicinity of La Veta, Colorado.

2. The Senator, in his letter dated 9 December 1955, to this office, referred the matter to this office by letter, dated 5 December 1955, to obtain information.

3. On 12 January 1956, Special Agent JAMES A. ROGERS, of this office, interviewed Senator at the Senate Chambers, Colorado State Capitol Building. Senator stated that while he was driving along the highway near La Veta, Colorado, he had seen a barrel-shaped object approximately 50 to 60 feet long and about 15 to 20 feet in diameter, hovering about 500 to 1000 feet above the ground. He compared it to a dirty gallon barrel and estimated twice the length with a tapering tail. He stated the object emitted a glow and a hum, appeared luminous, seemed to maneuver in flight, and did not make any sound nor was any exhaust or trail made. He estimated that the object was approximately 1,000 feet above sea level, revealed about ten miles during his observation and suddenly disappeared from view over this location. He estimated the speed of the object as being about one-half the speed of a jet aircraft for approximately five seconds and he estimated the object's size as being about three-fourths the size of a fighter aircraft wing span.
