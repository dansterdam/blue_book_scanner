The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a document page from Project Blue Book, an official United States Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects.

The text in the document reads:

I believe that the Boulder Library probably has a copy of my book, "Flying Saucers." If so, it might be interested in reading it.

Thanking you for your kindness in sending me the picture and again please accept my apologies for a tardy communication.

Sincerely yours,

Donald H. Menzel
Director
