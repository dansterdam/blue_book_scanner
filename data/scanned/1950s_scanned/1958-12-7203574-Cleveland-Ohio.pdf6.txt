Dear Sir:

At 10:25 p.m. on December 10, 1958, saw an object. It was traveling east-north and the object was traveling east-north also. Its elevation was several hundred feet. Its diameter was estimated to be about 60 degrees in approximately a 5 second duration. It appeared to be silvery object, illuminated with a bright light on the horizon. Its length was about 50 feet. The object passed through the center was about 20 feet.

Sincerely yours,
