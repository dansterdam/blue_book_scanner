1229 TACTICAL CONTROL SQUADRON
Regular Air Force Base
Henderson, New Hampshire
19 July 1952

STATEMENT
In per verbal request of Major Cook the following report is submitted:
At approximately 2130 hours, 19 July 1952, I was flying at 6000 feet, in a T-33 jet trainer, approx. 15 miles east of Manchester, New Hampshire, on a heading of 359 degrees, when I suddenly observed near the horizon, a bright light which appeared stationary. This light was a brilliant white, about twice the size of a bright star, and in a constant position for several minutes.
As I observed this light, it suddenly began to move in a zig-zag manner, then in a sharp right-angled course, and in a few seconds, then accelerated to a speed that seemed in the neighborhood of 1000 to 2000 miles per hour. It followed by a slight pink, then blue-white trail, as it shot through the sky. As it moved, it suddenly reversed course and headed back on essentially the same path, only to repeat the same maneuver. This was done in the space of only a few seconds, with no appreciable loss of speed or altitude.
Being about 1 1/2 minutes into the incident, I decided to close on the object to take a closer look. As I did so, the object again reversed its course and accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed, moving from one to two seconds, then suddenly faded from sight. Assuming that this was a meteor or some similar astronomical phenomena, I would estimate the speed at two thousand miles per hour.
