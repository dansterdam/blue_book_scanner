The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a Joint Messageform from the Project Blue Book documentation. 

The text extracted from the document is as follows:

The object was observed at Prague Isle for five hours from 2200 ST 10 Oct. 52 until 0300 EST 11 Oct. 52 and was described as a "circular, orange object with four green lights nearby". Our analysis of the readings was accomplished by extrapolating the existence of Prague Isle to make the flying object coincidate. By so doing the object seems to have been traveling at 27 mph and flying at an altitude of + 500,000', extremely high for even an upper air research balloon.

However, the fact that your balloon was on an easterly track at Toronto and was handled in the general direction of Maine, compared to the object's description and carry with the wind, gives us the impression that the unknown probably was your balloon. The estimate discrepancy may be a mistake in reading the theodolite although it would require a large margin of error.

Project Blue Book would appreciate knowing your further opinions or comments.
