CASE FILE NO. 6310218
REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
LOCATION: NENANA, ALASKA
DATE: 29 NOVEMBER 1952
TIME: 1912 HOURS
REPORTED BY: AIR FORCE RADAR INSTALLATION (UNIDENTIFIED)
INVESTIGATOR: C. A. MALONE, CAPTAIN, USAF, ACTING DISTRICT SUPERVISOR
BACKGROUND: AT APPROXIMATELY 1912 HOURS ON 29 NOVEMBER 1952, THE RADAR INSTALLATION LOCATED AT NENANA, ALASKA, DETECTED AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT ON ITS SCOPE. THE OBJECT WAS AT AN ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 12,000 FEET AND APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING AT A SPEED OF 700 KNOTS. SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE OF THE OBJECT AS IT MOVED ACROSS THE RADAR SCOPE.
DESCRIPTION OF OBJECT: THE OBJECT APPEARED AS A STATIONARY BRIGHT SPOT ON THE RADAR SCOPE, NOT VARYING IN INTENSITY. THERE WERE NO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE RETURN INDICATION ON THE SCOPE. THE OBJECT MAINTAINED A CONSTANT ALTITUDE AND SPEED THROUGHOUT THE OBSERVATION PERIOD. NO SOUND WAS DETECTED FROM THE OBJECT.
INVESTIGATION AND CONCLUSION: AFTER CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF THE RADAR DATA AND VISUAL OBSERVATIONS, IT IS THE OPINION OF THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER THAT THE OBJECT DETECTED WAS A METEOROLOGICAL BALLOON. THE OBJECT'S CONSTANT SPEED, ALTITUDE, AND LACK OF MANEUVERABILITY ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A WEATHER BALLOON. NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED.
