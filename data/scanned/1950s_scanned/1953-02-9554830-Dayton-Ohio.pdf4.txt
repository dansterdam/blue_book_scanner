There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from a U.S. Air Force technical information sheet, which contains handwritten text describing an incident.

The text in the document states:

On February 4, 1953, at 4:30 a.m. a blinking light was observed in the sky. The light appeared slowly from the horizon and remained stationary for some time, then suddenly started to move rapidly in the sky. The light was of large size and gave off an unusually bright light. It was watched until 4:42 a.m. when it disappeared.
