Phenomena
 If the heart's got you down, 
 think of the folks in Punta 
 Arenas, Chile. They're having 
 the snowiest winter in years 
 (above). The "unidentified fly- 
 ing object" at right was photo- 
 graphed last October by a gov- 
 ernment employ e at Alamo- 
 gordo, N.M. The picture was 
 just released by the Air Tech- 
 nical Intelligence Organization, 
 copyrighted, but with no ex-
 planation.
