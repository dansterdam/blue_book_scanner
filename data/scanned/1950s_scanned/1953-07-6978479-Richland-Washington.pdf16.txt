Dear Sir:

This will acknowledge your recent letter concerning the unusual object sighted by you in the vicinity of Richland, Washington. On the day the letter was received this letter was referred to the Security Division of the Armed Forces Security Agency since it appeared that such information would be of primary interest to that organization and to the Army Air Forces.

You may be assured that your report will be treated factually. In the event any of the investigated services desire to contact you further, they will probably do so directly. 

I appreciate your interest in referring this matter to me, and hope that any inquiries from other official sources which may think might be made will be referred to me.

Very truly yours,

R. D. AUERBACH 
Special Agent in Charge
