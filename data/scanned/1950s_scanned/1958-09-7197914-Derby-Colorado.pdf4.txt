The image appears to contain a memo routing slip with information about a 35mm color slide. The slide was returned to Mr. Derby in Colorado. The ATIC photo lab determined that the red dot in the center of the slide was a perforation of one or two layers of emulsion, likely caused by a small rise with a pit at the center from a light source.

The text in the document is as follows:

1. The attached 35MM color slide is to be returned to Mr. Derby, Colorado.
2. The red dot was determined by the ATIC photo lab to be a perforation of one or two layers of emulsion. If the slide is held at an angle to a light source, a small rise with a pit at the center can then be seen.
