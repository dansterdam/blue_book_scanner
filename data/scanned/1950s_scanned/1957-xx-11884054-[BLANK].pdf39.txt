The image does not contain any visible photographs. It appears to be a page from a document discussing visual cues and methods for identifying the size and distance of objects, such as perspective, convergence of parallel lines, and overlapping objects. The text on the page provides explanations and descriptions related to these topics.

From the known size of an object and how much of our visual field it fills.
From our knowledge of perspective and the convergence of parallel lines at a great distance.
From overlapping - an object overlapped by another is known to be farther away.
