There is a hand-drawn sketch in the image that appears to depict the shape and movement of a "large object" as described in the text. The sketch shows an irregular, elongated shape with a wavy, undulating outline.

The text in the document is as follows:

16. Tell in a few words the following things about the object:
a. Sound
b. Color - Large object - Yellowish-green, Luminous

17. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object or objects. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw such as wings, protrusions, etc., and especially exhaust trails or vapor trails. Place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.

18. The edges of the object were:
(Circle One) 1. Sharp 2. Blurred 3. Hazy (Like a bright star) 4. Other - Small object- less defined

19. IF there was MORE THAN ONE object, then how many were there and put an arrow to show the direction that they were traveling.

The smaller objects seemed to go in a cluster and were not well defined, and some appeared to be moving in different directions.
