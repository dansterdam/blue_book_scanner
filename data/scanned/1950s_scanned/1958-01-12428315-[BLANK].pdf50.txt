Direct from the files of the Air Technical Intelligence Center ... another case. 
Date: March 9, 1957. A commercial airliner flying between New York and San Juan, Porto Rico had an extraordinary experience. Flying at 19,000 feet it sighted a large, bright object that appeared to be coming directly towards the liner. It was described as "a magnesium-flash" in color with a pale green tint. The pilot had to swerve his plane violently to avoid collision.
