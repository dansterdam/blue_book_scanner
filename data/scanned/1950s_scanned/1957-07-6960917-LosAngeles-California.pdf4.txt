SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT
ON 26 JULY 1957 I received a phone call in Los Angeles from an individual who was very excited. He stated that he and another individual had observed an unidentified flying object at approximately 2215 hours on 25 July 1957. I met the individual at the specified location and obtained the following information:
The individual stated that at approximately 2215 hours on 25 July 1957 he and another individual were standing on Topanga Canyon Road looking in a northerly direction when they observed an unidentified object in the sky. The object appeared to be approximately 20 to 25 feet in diameter and was circular in shape. It appeared to be at an approximate altitude of 2000 to 3000 feet and was traveling in a northerly direction at a very high speed. The object gave off a reddish-orange glow and was visible for approximately 15 seconds before disappearing below the horizon.
The individual stated that the object was definitely not an aircraft, helicopter, or any other known type of aerial vehicle. He was quite emphatic in stating that this was a genuine unidentified flying object.
