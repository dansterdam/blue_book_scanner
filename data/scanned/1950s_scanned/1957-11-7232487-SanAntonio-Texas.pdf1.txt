Oval shaped object with a fluorescent glow appeared in the sky and hovered for several minutes. It then made a right angle turn and shot out of sight.
11. COMMENTS
This sighting appears to be the result of an over active imagination. The object was reported as a lighted object that was hovering and then made a sharp turn and departed. No other substantiating data.
