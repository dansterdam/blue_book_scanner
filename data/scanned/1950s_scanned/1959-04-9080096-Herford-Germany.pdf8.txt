The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a hand-drawn sketch and some handwritten text. The sketch appears to depict a structure or building, with labels and annotations. The handwritten text describes some observations or details related to the sketch.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

Had a very unusual look about it. i saw on the night of 3/11/59 that a bright object was motionless and remained in one position for some 30 min. or so. It seemed to be hovering low over the trees. Size was about the size of a man's hand held at arm's length. It had a bright yellow-orange inner core and was surrounded by a bright white glow. I saw no engines, wings, or other visible means of propulsion. The object seemed to be self-luminous.
