The shared image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document, likely from Project Blue Book. The text on the image describes an analysis of a UFO sighting, including details about the object's appearance, movement, and duration of the sighting.

Analysis of the returned ATIC forms and the AF Form 112 indicates the following:
1. The 09/10/1952 sighting was not reported by sources in the ATIC forms. (Several copies of the 02/13/53 form were sent to complete a report for each sighting.)
2. The ATIC Form 14 description of the 11/02/31 sighting indicates that this sighting was possibly caused by a helicopter.
The brief description of the sighting from ATIC Form is as follows:
Object travelled from NE to NW at a moderate speed. Object hovered in one spot for approximately 30 minutes. Object disappeared by its light gradually going out. No sound was heard.
In light of above considerations and the wind direction, evaluation of this sighting is possibly aircraft (helicopter).
