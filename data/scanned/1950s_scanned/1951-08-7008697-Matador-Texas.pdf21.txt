The image does not contain any photograph. However, it appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official United States Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects. The text in the document is as follows:

Synopsis (Continued)
This synopsis was taken by an operations officer and former
Special Agent, Air Material Command, who investigated this incident. According to the report, on 23 June 1951, at 1620 hours, a jet pilot near Matador, Texas, in the air at 28,000 feet, visibility 3-5 miles, observed an unidentified object which appeared to be about the same size as the jet but at a considerable distance. The object was observed to be moving rapidly and erratically compared to the jet. It was lost to sight after approximately 30 seconds. It is apparently the same case reported over Lubbock on 25 June 1951.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; 
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
