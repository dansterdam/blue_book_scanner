Dear Miss

Inclosed are the two negatives you submitted to this Center for analysis. The object in question could not be satisfactorily identified, however, from the detail left by the object. It is felt the object was probably an aircraft in flight.

Your interest in this matter is sincerely appreciated.

Sincerely,

H. K. GILBERT
