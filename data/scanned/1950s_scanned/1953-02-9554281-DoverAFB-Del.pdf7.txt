There is no photograph present in this image. The image consists entirely of handwritten text on what appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text reads as follows:

"The object started descending rapidly to the right of the horizon. The witnesses stated they could tell the O.D. was real and that it steered in one direction on its own accord as if under control. At 13:30 hrs e the object did a sharp turn and headed due S. The witnesses continued to watch the object as it did maneuvers. It was first observed as a dot in the sky, then as it came closer it took on the shape of a large dirigible balloon, as I looked closer it was irregular in shape and seemed to change shape slightly. This object was sighted for over 15 minutes before it disappeared completely out of sight. I would not say it was a balloon, nor do I believe it was a normal aircraft, I cannot identify this object."
