WASHINGTON

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

Dear Mr. Ardier:
Here is a letter from Congressman Henderson of the 15th District, Ohio, concerning UFO's.
He asks many questions and we desire to have complete answers to each one in response to his letter.
He also wants ten of the best sightings in the last five years which have been classified as "unknown". Please oblige to the best of your ability.
I intend to hand-carry the reply to Mr. Henderson and brief him on the entire project as Roland did Chairman Vinson and we intend to show him the minutes of the Formal Report.
I suspect the letter was inspired by a constituent in Ohio but, since the Congressman uses first person, we must handle as a personal concern.
I need this information in my office no later than 27 May 1958.
Sorry for the time element but their suspense to me is the next day.
Sincerely,
LAWRENCE J. VAUGHT
Major, USAF
