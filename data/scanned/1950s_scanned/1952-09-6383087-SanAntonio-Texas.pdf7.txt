At 10:39 PM on the night of September Seventh, 1952, we were sitting outside our house observing the night sky. At this time, we observed a strange elongated object hovering in the northern sky. This object, or 13.5 feet, lighted on two ends, glided across the sky at a tremendous speed, and appeared to be about 20 degrees from the horizon.
We observed the object for several minutes, and it appeared to be about 2 miles away, reflecting the strange lights for several minutes. The object then abruptly disappeared, leaving no sound. To the best of our knowledge, this object could not possibly be any known aircraft, but it seems to us that it could possibly be the reflection of a heavenly body or a luminous meteorite. We are reporting this observation to the best of our knowledge.
