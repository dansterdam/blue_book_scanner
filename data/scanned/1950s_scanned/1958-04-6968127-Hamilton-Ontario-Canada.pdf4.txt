The image does not contain photographs. It is a hand-drawn sketch and annotations which seem to describe observations or characteristics of unidentified flying objects (UFOs):

The page contains several sketches of different shapes with corresponding notes. There is a sketch resembling a line of trees with another notated as "North" with a partial outline labeled as "Trees." Below these are two more sketches: one resembles an object with a flat bottom and curved top, captioned with text regarding its size and appearance like a "blast furnace." The other sketch looks like an oval or elongated shape. There are various handwritten notes surrounding the sketches.

Here is the text present on the document as requested:
