INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object

DETAIL: On 17 June 1952, at approximately 21:30 hours, Mr. and Mrs. Holmen of Holmen, Wisconsin, observed an unusual aerial object. At first, they thought it was an airplane, but upon closer observation they found it did not have the characteristics of an airplane. The object was described as being elongated in shape, brightly illuminated, and moving rapidly. It was observed for approximately two minutes.

AT 0145 hours (central time) on the 18th of April 1952, a strange object was observed hovering over Holmen, Wisconsin. This object reportedly maneuvered rapidly and silently, descended, and appeared to produce flashes of light from both ends.
