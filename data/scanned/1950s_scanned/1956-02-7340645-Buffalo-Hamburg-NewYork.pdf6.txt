AF FORM 112--PART II
APPROVED: 1 JUNE 1955
AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
FLIGHT: 3-D, 4602d AISS
INCL: Lt. MART TILLIE, Rept. 3D-UFO-1-56
STATEMENT: 
After leveling out at 4000' indicated and contacting GCI, I was vectored into what appeared to be a star or bright object over the town portion of Buffalo, N.Y. As I approached this time I started to investigate more closely. In doing so it suddenly disappeared, but a short time later I again noticed it - this time lower in altitude, and closer to the edge of the Buffalo area. It was brighter than any other object in the area at the time and seemed to be pulsating or flashing on and off. I decided to take one last look, banked the A/C around, and there it was behind me - dead astern and slightly higher. I continued to maneuver with my radar equip. - that was operating very satisfactorily.
