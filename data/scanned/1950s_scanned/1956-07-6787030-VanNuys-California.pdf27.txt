Part I - Introduction
This report covers the investigation and analysis of all unidentified aerial objects reported to the Air Force during the calendar year 1956. The data was compiled and analyzed by the Office of Special Investigations, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Part II - Analysis of Sightings
A total of 1,060 reports of unidentified aerial objects were received and investigated during 1956. Of these, 303 were classified as IDENTIFIED, 211 as INSUFFICIENT DATA, and 546 as UNIDENTIFIED.

The IDENTIFIED cases were found to be conventional aircraft, balloons, astronomical bodies, and other natural phenomena. The INSUFFICIENT DATA cases lacked enough information to permit adequate analysis and classification.

The UNIDENTIFIED cases, totaling 546, were those in which a reasonable explanation could not be determined based on the data available. These cases were subjected to the most intensive investigation and analysis.

Part III - Conclusions and Recommendations
The analysis of the 1956 sightings data has led to the following conclusions:

1. A significant number of sightings, approximately 50% of the total, remain UNIDENTIFIED after investigation.
2. The UNIDENTIFIED sightings exhibit features or exhibit characteristics which are beyond the capability of present-day aircraft and do not conform to known natural phenomena.
3. Further study of the UNIDENTIFIED sightings is warranted to attempt to determine the nature and origin of the objects observed.

Recommendations:
1. Continued collection and analysis of reports of unidentified aerial objects.
2. Expansion of investigative resources and capabilities to improve data collection and analysis.
3. Closer coordination with civilian organizations engaged in similar research.
