The image contains a page from what appears to be a Project Blue Book report. There are three sketches on the page:

1. The top sketch shows a curved line with the label "A" on it, indicating the trajectory of an object above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it.

2. The middle sketch depicts a roadway with buildings and trees along the sides, with a person standing in the middle of the road.

3. The bottom sketch shows a landscape with trees and a road or path going towards the horizon.

As an OCR system, I will now output the text found in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
