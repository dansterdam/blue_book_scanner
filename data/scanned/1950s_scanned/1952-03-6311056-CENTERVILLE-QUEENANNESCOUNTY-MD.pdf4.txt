Report of Sighting

Mr. [redacted] of [redacted], Washington, D.C., reported the sighting took place at Centerville, Queen Anne's County, Md., on 20 March 1952 at 2:42.

The object was described as a dull, orange-yellow, sugar-shaped light resembling an old-fashioned light bulb. The size of the light was twice to three times that of an ordinary 4/5 wing light.

The object was traveling very fast and seemed about five miles away from the observer halfway between the horizon and zenith.

The only maneuver performed by the object was twice jumping vertically a distance equal to what looked like a foot at that range. The jumping is similar in nature to the bounce of a basketball.
