Statement of F-94 Radar Observer  

On the morning of 29 Jan 52 I was flying as radar observer in the rear seat of an F-94B. After a few interceptions on another F-94 I turned the set off for the remainder of the mission. This was because of generator difficulties.  

We then flew down to the Millinocket, Me area to try to intercept a T-29, Callasign ALO-66. We circled Millinocket for a while and then headed toward Houlton, Me but never spotted the T-29 which was supposedly flying over Houlton at approximately 1000 EST on a magnetic heading of 070 degrees. When over the St. John River the pilot spotted an object straight ahead of us. I finally saw the object after he had pointed it out repeatedly. We turned right so as to silence objects to the left. We then resumed our 070 degree heading and chased the object for several minutes at a speed of 300 kts at 23,000 feet (approx 170 K IAS). We did not close on the object and soon broke off because of low fuel supply.  

The object was gray and its shape was thin and oval. It was at a small angle (5 degrees at most) above us. It stayed stationary in the sky during the chase. It was well-defined and multi-colored, that is, it was not shiny or luminous. There was no visible means of propulsion nor was there any exhaust smoke or contrails. The object appeared unbroken in outline and there were no portholes or windows visible.  

After we had landed and studied the problem I decided we had been about 50 miles N of the St. John River when we broke off. After comparison with a dime held at armâ€™s length I believe the object was about 1/2 to 3/4 the size of a dime.  

We landed about 10 or 15 minutes after breaking-off.
