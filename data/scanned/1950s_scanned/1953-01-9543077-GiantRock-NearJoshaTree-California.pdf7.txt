U. S. AIR FORCE TECHNICAL INFORMATION SHEET
(SUMMARY DATA)

My observation in this connection was the following:  On September 11, 1953 came personally the report that a giant rock near Joshua Tree, California, was observed. This rock appeared to be about 7 feet in height and about 5 feet in diameter. I think that the observer thought the above impression as to the size of the rock could not be precise, since he did not have any comparison object near the rock. Since I wrote the above letter, the observer has several other friends. Many of them observed this same object and under virtually the same conditions as the original observer. In addition, several other individuals observed the same object under slightly different conditions as well.
