The text on the document states:
"Mrs. 10-2-1918, ----- police reported to police that she was walking along a street in Solma, Ca. she saw a bright light in the sky, and it seemed to be getting bigger and closer. She said it appeared to be a flat, round, silver object which she estimated to be about 30-35 feet in diameter. It passed directly over her at an estimated altitude of 500-600 feet. As it passed over her head, it appeared to emit a shower of sparks. The object then gained altitude and disappeared from sight in a northerly direction."
