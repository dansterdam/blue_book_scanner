The image appears to be a pie chart showing the "Distribution of Object Sightings by Evaluation for All Years with Comparisons of Each Year for Each Evaluation Group" from Project Blue Book. The chart categorizes the sightings into different groups such as "Unknown", "Astronomical", "Aircraft", "Balloon", "Infif. Info.", and "Other", with the percentage of sightings for each category shown for various years.
