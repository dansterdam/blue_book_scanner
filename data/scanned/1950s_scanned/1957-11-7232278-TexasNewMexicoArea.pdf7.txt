The document describes sightings of unidentified flying objects reported by a member of the U.S. Border Patrol near El Paso, Texas and Midland, Texas in November 1957. The text states that the sightings were "very definitly and unidentifiable" but that no conclusions could be drawn as to the origin of the objects. The document also mentions that a correspondent had photographic equipment but failed to use it in time as the object was disappearing.
