This image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a scanned page from an old Project Blue Book document. The text on the page is handwritten and describes some type of observation or report, but there is no visible photograph or image included.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now output the text found in the document:

OBSERVERS STATED THAT THE OBJECT OR LIGHT COVERED IN DISTANCE UP TO SEVEN MILES AROUND ITS POSITION AND WAS APPROXIMATELY SEEN FOR ONE AND A HALF HOURS. VISIBILITY TO SEVERAL OBSERVERS FROM VARIOUS LOCATIONS WAS EXCELLENT. THE SIZE OR OUTLINE OF THE OBJECT OR LIGHT COULD NOT BE EASILY DETERMINED BY THESE OBSERVERS DUE TO THE RAPID MOVEMENT OF THE OBJECT AND GREAT DISTANCE FROM OBSERVER. SOME STATED THEY DETECTED FLASHING LIGHTS AND CHANGES IN COLORS DURING THE OBSERVATIONS.
