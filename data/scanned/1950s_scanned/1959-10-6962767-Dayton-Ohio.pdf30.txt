The image does not contain any photographs. The text appears to be a report from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text describes an incident on October 23, 1959 in Los Angeles, California where a bright object was seen streaking across the sky, causing police and sheriff departments to receive calls from residents. The object was reported to have a greenish-white light before disappearing over the horizons, and a federal aviation agency spokesman was quoted commenting on the event.
