SUMMARY: On 22 JULY 1952, a witness reported the sighting of several unidentified flying objects in the sky over WHITE PLAINS, NEW YORK, on 17 JULY 1952. The objects were moving from northwest to southeast, and were accompanied by a whirring sound. The objects crossed the sky in 5-6 seconds, and appeared to be flying at an altitude which would have been indistinguishable. The witness was of the opinion that the objects were flying at a very high speed and at an extremely high altitude. The weather at the time of the sighting was clear and visibility was unlimited.
