The image does not contain a photograph. The document appears to be a report from Dobbins Air Force Base in Georgia dated February 3, 1953, discussing an unidentified flying object observation.

The text of the document is as follows:

Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia
3 February 1953

I. Description of Incident
Military personnel observed a red-yellow-white stationary object from this base at approximately 22:30 EST. The object was observed for 15 minutes before slowly disappearing below the horizon. It appeared in the west and was brighter than red observation lights on the control tower at Dobbins.

II. Discussion of Incident
No triangulation from the two observing points was made which would have been extremely helpful and should be attempted in sightings such as this. The description and manner of disappearance strongly suggests astronomical sightings as described in Project Blue Book and Mitchell AFB in October and December of 1952.

III. Conclusion
Probably astronomical (bright evening star).
