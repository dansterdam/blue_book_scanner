The text in the document is as follows:

Page 2
The curved section being more pronounced in the first half of the "Trail", is due, in part, to the length of travel approximating 1500 ft. The upper and bottom lines are virtually parallel. No resemblance to exhaust from jet or combustion type engine - no appearance of flames - no discoloration. Impression of speed 200 to 300 miles per hour - impression of height, approximately 500 ft. Impression of distance approximately 1500 ft. No noise noted.

6. Observer: OBSERVER: Wichita, Kansas - Age 45 
President, Swallow Airplane Company - graduate Aeronautical Engineer - class 1935 - continious aircraft experience since graduation.

Note 1: The second appearance was noted simultaneously by Mrs. Bloomfield and myself.

Note 2: The Wichita Evening Eagle of April 16, 1952 reports as follows: "Mrs. --------, 1413 Forest Drive, saw a strangely lighted object in the heavens Tuesday night and she is wondering if any other Wichitans living in that area had seen any "flying saucers" reports. Mrs. ------- said the strange light was in the southwest, in a matter of seconds. "A vivid green in color, it had the appearance of a huge kite with a long tail, perhaps 150-200 ft. in length" The woman said her husband tried to take a picture for which she was fitted Tuesday, but she insists she didn't have then on at the time."

Note 3: In each of the two appearances I estimate the time the light was exposed at 1.5 seconds.
