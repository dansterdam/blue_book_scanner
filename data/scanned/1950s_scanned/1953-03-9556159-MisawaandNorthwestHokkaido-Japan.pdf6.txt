AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
TO: 5113a ADON GP, APO 919 IR-9-53
STATEMENT
On 1 March 1953, I was on duty in radar operations. I was notified at this time that an unusual object had been detected on previous radar scopes and confirmed on additional scopes. The object appeared on the radar scope for several minutes, then disappeared. It reappeared to the north-northwest on a different azimuth, and appeared to be bobbing up and down. The object was at 270 degrees from the radar station and at an angle of about 30 degrees from the horizon.
In 1955 hours, I called in another station, and advised them of the sighting. Their observations agreed with mine. The object appeared to be about 3 to 4 times the size of a jet aircraft.
I cannot estimate the distance or the speed of the object, therefore I cannot determine the altitude or the speed of the apparent motion.
