The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book report, specifically an "Air Intelligence Information Report" dated 27 October 1952 regarding an unidentified flying object observed over Kyushu, Japan.

The text in the document is as follows:

Narrative Report of Unidentified Flying Object on 27 October 1952, by 1st Lt. Charles A. Koyacs, Radar Observer.

The foregoing was a true and complete narrative of the flight of "Bonfire Green" from 18507 to 20321 on 27 October 1952.

Amendment to Narrative Report of Unidentified Flying Object on 27 October 1952, by 1st Lt. Charles Koyacs, Radar Observer:

Upon picking up the light visually, the Radar Observer attempted to pick up and track the object with the radar. Although no return was picked up on the radar, the Radar Observer continued in his attempts to track the object. The bright light was observed to suddenly disappear. The Radar Observer reported this to the Bomber Commander.

This rapid maneuver led the Radar Observer to take off and sighting of the light. The Radar Observer did not have time to check the operation of the equipment.

The sighting was terminated and the aircraft returned to base.
