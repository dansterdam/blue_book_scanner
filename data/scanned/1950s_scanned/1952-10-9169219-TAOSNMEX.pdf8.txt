SIORN STATEMENT

I, Charles R Coble, Maj. USAF, AO 9004755, 490th Air Base Group, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statement:

At approximately 2110 hours, on the night of 17 October 1952, while traveling into Taos, New Mexico, I observed from the car window, high in the sky, a large blue object about the size of a volley ball. This object was traveling from a north to a northeast direction at about 45 to 70 degrees angle, and was bright blue in color. It would estimate its speed as approximately 2,500 miles per hour, and was approximately 10,000 feet above the ground.

I would say that I observed the object for about 2 or 3 seconds, and it then disappeared.

Charles R. Coble
Maj. USAF
AO 9004755

Sworn to and subscribed before me on this 21st day of October 1952.
