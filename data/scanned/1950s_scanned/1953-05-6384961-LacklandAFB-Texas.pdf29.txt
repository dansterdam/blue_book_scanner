1. PERTINENT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
(Secret) ATIC has received a report from a radar site at San Antonio, Texas, concerning the visual and radar sightings of several unidentified objects over Lackland AFB, Texas, on 15 May 1953. Five or more targets appeared to be orbiting over the base for 15 to 20 minutes. They appeared on the radar scope as unnatural sights and intermittent contact was maintained for over 20,000 ft. No speed estimates was possible.

2. SPECIFIC REQUEST:
(Confidential) It is requested that a determination be made if Mexican aircraft were in the area at the time of sighting. The number and maneuvers of the targets suggest military aircraft. There are fields at 1) Monterrey, and 2) Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, which can be checked.
