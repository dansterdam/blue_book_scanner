Subject: Small Flying Torpedo-like Craft.
Date of Occurrence: October 12, 1953.
Place: Riverhead.

About 7:00 P.M. I was again on our front porch, when I noticed one of the smaller craft across visibility break from a distance. I watched it for a while, and it came over and also went away. They were for the holding.

To this date, I have not been able to describe them accurately to the city, and watch for more, and then I called my husband on the telephone, and told him about it, and I debated as to whether I should have called the police.

At about 3:00 P.M. I called the state police in Riverhead, and told them that I had previously reported on Oct. 12th, 1953.

The desk sergeant was courteous, and asked my name, address and telephone number, and said he would investigate.

He asked me "if I could possibly be seeing lights reflected from the water?" to which I answered. "I was certain that it wasn't due to reflections of to street lights."

After that he hung up, and I suppose a car was dispatched until about 8:30 P.M. and then went inside our house.
