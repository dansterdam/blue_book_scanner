The text in the document is as follows:

THIS THING HAPPENED ON 1 JULY 53 ABOUT 8 PM PST. MY FIANCEE AND I WERE PARKED IN A VACANT LOT WATCHING A MET BALLOON PASS WHEN WE SUDDENLY SIGHTED A VERY STRANGE LOOKING OBJECT APPROACHING FROM THE NORTH. IT APPEARED TO BE LONG AND TUBULAR OR CIGAR-SHAPED AND HAD A SOFT GLOW OF LIGHT OVER ITS ENTIRE SURFACE. IT WAS TRAVELING AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED WHICH I WOULD ESTIMATE AT AROUND 15 TO 20 MILES PER HOUR. IT SEEMED TO BE JUST ABOVE THE TREE TOPS AND GLIDED ALONG WITH A SMOOTH MOTION WITHOUT ANY SOUND BEING DETECTED. WHEN IT WAS ABOUT 500 YARDS FROM US AND APPEARED HEADED DIRECTLY FOR OUR LOCATION, IT SUDDENLY CHANGED DIRECTION AND CLIMBED AT A VERY SHARP ANGLE ALMOST VERTICAL. IT WENT UP FOR PERHAPS 2 OR 3 SECONDS THEN STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND HOVERED FOR SEVERAL SECONDS WITH NO ENGINE OR EXHAUST TRAILS OR ANY VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION. AFTER HOVERING FOR PERHAPS 2 OR 3 SECONDS IT TURNED ON A DIME TO AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM WHICH IT CAME AND SHOT OUT OF SIGHT IN A BLINK OF AN EYE. IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY OWN EYES. WHATEVER IT WAS, IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE SUBJECT TO GRAVITY OR ANY NORMAL FLIGHT CHARACTERISTIC. IT WAS A SLOW FLUTTERING MOTION UP AND IT SEEMED BACK AGAIN AND THEN IT WAS GONE. PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OR IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS INCIDENT.
