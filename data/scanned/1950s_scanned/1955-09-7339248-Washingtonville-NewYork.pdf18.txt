FLIGHT 14 - SEPTEMBER 6, 1955

On Flight 14 of the 6th at approximately 1925 EST, geographical position approximately 10 miles east of Washingtonville, New York, the 5700 Ft. indicated altitude, my crew and I observed an unidentified object with a blue-white exhaust flame.

The object had a half-mile or mile directly ahead in our track, climbing at an angle of approximately 1000 ft. above our position on what appeared to be about a 200-210 degree course in an accelerated flight descent.

In approximately 3 seconds the object had moved from directly in front of us to about 100 degrees off our track, shutting off completely a blinding flash within, trailing a bluish flame.

Flight 13, when I believe, was in the vicinity of ALB at about 8500 ft. reported seeing the flash although he was northbound. Southbound flight 35 who was within 600 ft. also reported seeing the flash.

I could see as the object was escape that it appeared like a rocket whip - although that is, perhaps, partially instinctive, inasmuch as all I really saw was a peak at this recall of flight and, just before it exploded, this seemed to be the picture I have in my mind's eye - a flaming, falling off of a projected object.

I feel certain that it was not a meteor as we had been looking in that direction and it just appeared. There was no trace of it until it got right in front of us. Its speed did not seem to have been decreased to have been in our cone of vision.
