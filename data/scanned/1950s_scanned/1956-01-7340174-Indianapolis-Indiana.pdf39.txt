STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
This analysis of the Air Force's investigation of Unidentified Flying Objects was prepared for the Air Force by the Battelle Memorial Institute under Project Blue Book.

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REPORTED UFO SIGHTINGS
1. The reported data on sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) from 1947 through 1952 has been analyzed statistically. The data are taken from the files of Project Blue Book, the Air Force's official investigative agency for UFO reports.
2. During this 6-year period, a total of 1,593 reports of UFO sightings were received and investigated by Project Blue Book. The 1,593 reports included in this analysis represent all known reports received and processed by the Air Force during this period.
3. The principal purposes of this statistical analysis are:
a. To determine the reliability of the reported data.
b. To determine the consistency and validity of the reported data.
c. To determine the distribution of sightings by location, time, and other factors.
d. To determine the characteristics of the reported UFOs.
e. To determine the reasons for the reported sightings.

RELIABILITY OF REPORTED DATA
4. Reliability of the reported data was studied by analyzing the degree of detail and consistency in the descriptions of the various sightings. A measure of the reliability of the reported data was obtained by examining the qualifications of the observers, the conditions under which the observations were made, and the specificity of the descriptions.

CONSISTENCY AND VALIDITY OF REPORTED DATA
5. Consistency and validity of the reported data were studied by analyzing the relationship between the various characteristics of the reported sightings. Particular emphasis was placed on determining the consistency between the descriptions of the UFOs and the stated reasons for the sightings.

DISTRIBUTION OF SIGHTINGS
6. The distribution of sightings was studied by analyzing the location, time, and other factors associated with the reported sightings.
