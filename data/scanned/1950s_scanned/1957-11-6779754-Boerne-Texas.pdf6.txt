"This happened at 2:15 p.m. on 6 Nov 57 near Boerne, Texas.
An object was observed for about 15 minutes. The object was estimated to be about 35 to 40 feet in diameter, round in shape, and silvery or white in color. It flew at an estimated speed of 600 to 800 mph. The object was observed to be approaching from the southwest and flying in a northeast direction. After reaching a point over a ranch house, it made a 90 degree turn and headed in a northerly direction. It then increased its speed and disappeared from sight in about 15 seconds.
The local Sheriff's office was notified of this incident, and the sighting was also reported to the nearest Air Force installation, although the identity of the observing witness is being withheld from this report.
