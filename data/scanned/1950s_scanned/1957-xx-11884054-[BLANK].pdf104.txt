The image contains two sketches.

The first sketch depicts a curved line with an "A" and a "B" marked on it. This sketch is meant to illustrate how high an object was above the horizon (skyline) when it was first seen and how high it was when it was last seen.

The second sketch contains three images. The larger central image shows a person standing on a road with buildings and trees in the background. The smaller image on the left shows a person on a curved line, and the smaller image on the right shows a landscape with mountains in the background.
