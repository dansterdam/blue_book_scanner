					9-M-7				Unidentified Object or Light Sighting

TO	26TH WEARON		FROM Con4ur	9 Dec 58

	26TH WEARON Ded 13,

1. Weather observer on duty at 2251C 7 Dec 58 sighted unidentified object 
or light on approximate bearing of 105 degrees, first visible 4 to 5 degrees
above horizon, falling straight down. It appeared as a bright glow, yellow
with red fringes, and appeared to resemble fire. Observer thought it was very
close to station. A check was made with Adams Field Control Tower, Little Rock,
who also saw it to the east of them. They checked with Memphis Tower, who had
seen it to their east, and it was found that Nashville Tower had seen it to their
northeast. I do not know if any checks were made further to the east or not.

2. This appears to me to be a meteorite, but the report is forwarded for 
whatever value it is.
