THERE WAS NO PICTURE TAKEN AT THE TIME OF THIS INCIDENT AND I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING RESEMBLING A FLYING SAUCER OR ANY OTHER UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT IN THE SKY THAT NIGHT. WHAT I DID SEE WAS A LIGHT IN THE SKY THAT SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANY KNOWN AIRCRAFT. IT WAS A SINGLE LIGHT, NOT FLASHING OR BLINKING, WHICH MOVED QUITE RAPIDLY FROM ONE POINT IN THE SKY TO ANOTHER. IT COVERED A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE IN A VERY SHORT TIME, MUCH FASTER THAN ANY PLANE I HAVE EVER SEEN. ALSO IT MADE NO SOUND AND GAVE OFF NO EXHAUST OR GLOW. I WOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY WHAT THIS LIGHT WAS, SINCE I HAVE NO IDEA WHATSOEVER. I SIMPLY KNOW THAT IT WAS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING I HAVE EVER OBSERVED IN THE SKY BEFORE.

I SHOULD MENTION THAT THE TIME OF THIS INCIDENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 12:10 AM ON THE MORNING OF AUGUST 6, 1955. THE LOCATION WAS AT MY HOME IN OLD GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT. THE WEATHER AT THE TIME WAS CLEAR AND THERE WAS A FULL MOON. I WAS OUTSIDE IN MY BACKYARD AT THE TIME, SIMPLY ENJOYING THE QUIET OF THE NIGHT, WHEN I HAPPENED TO GLANCE UP AND SEE THIS STRANGE LIGHT IN THE SKY. IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 40 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON AND WAS TRAVELING IN A GENERALLY SOUTHERLY DIRECTION. I WATCHED IT FOR ONLY A FEW SECONDS BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. THAT IS THE TOTAL OF MY OBSERVATIONS AND I AM UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY FURTHER DETAILS. ACTUALLY, I WAS SO SURPRISED BY WHAT I SAW THAT I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO MAKE ANY CAREFUL OBSERVATIONS. I SIMPLY KNOW THAT IT WAS SOMETHING QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY.
