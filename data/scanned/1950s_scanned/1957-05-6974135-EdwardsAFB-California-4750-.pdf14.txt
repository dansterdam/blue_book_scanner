RECORD OF INVESTIGATION
1. SUBJECT - (C) - Unidentified Flying Object Observed at Edwards AFB, California.

2. LOCATION - Edwards Air Force Base, California

3. DATE - 6 May 1957

4. TIME - 1345 hours (1:45 p.m.) Pacific Standard Time

5. WITNESSES - (C) - Lt. Col. Walter G. Winstead, USAF, Pilot, 4750th Test Squadron

6. DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING - (C) - Lt. Col. Winstead reported that while flying at an altitude of approximately 7,500 feet in an F-84F aircraft, he observed a small bright light in the sky at a position estimated to be about 3 miles northwest of his aircraft. The light was first observed at an elevation angle of approximately 40 degrees above the horizon. As the light moved rapidly in a straight line, the elevation angle increased to about 70 degrees above the horizon. The light then appeared to go out. The total duration of the sighting was approximately 10 seconds. Lt. Col. Winstead stated that the light did not blink or flicker, and that it appeared to move at a speed far in excess of any conventional aircraft. (C)

7. CONCLUSION - (C) - The identity of the object observed by Lt. Col. Winstead has not been determined. There were no other witnesses to the sighting, and no physical evidence or material was recovered. However, the rapid straight-line movement and high speed of the object as described by the witness are not characteristic of any known conventional aircraft or other identifiable aerial phenomena. (C)
