The image does not contain any photographs or images. It appears to be a handwritten document with text. I will now transcribe the text present in the document:

Phoenix, Arizona

The read quickly I get a location and a brief description of some unspecified objects. My children were observing something in the night sky at some point and were curious as to what it was. I believe some are quite good and some are haphazard. I submitted them by telepathing because under normal conditions I would have seemed to be on the edge of an abyss. Apparently must often I learn the wonder. I beg you to accept this and to continue your investigations in this matter as I sincerely believe some are good and haphazard.
