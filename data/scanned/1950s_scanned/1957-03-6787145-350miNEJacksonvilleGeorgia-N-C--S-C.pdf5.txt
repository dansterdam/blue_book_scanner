The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, the text found in the document is as follows:

I was a passenger on the plane described on the reverse side. 
I did not observe an unidentified flying object after the plane
evasive action referred to on the reverse side.
The weather was clear. I was asleep when the pilot took the
evasive action, which I was later informed consisted of zooming upwards.
I was awakened when my head struck the baggage rack above my seat.
I do not understand by the fact that the pilot leveled off too abruptly after zooming upwards. One civilian was noted out after the
accident - whether or not it was out of commission before the accident, I do not know.
I saw no flying object at any time during the flight.
