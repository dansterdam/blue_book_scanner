During the month of July on three (3) different occasions, pilots and radar observers of the 666th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, reported unusual radar returns contained in the F-94 type aircraft.
Ie Lt Conn D. Kelly (2-0), Radar Observer:

At approximately 07:32 in the Kodiak Sea area, 57째49'N, 152째13'W, while at 5,000 feet altitude, contacted an object moving at approximately 20,000 mph for a period of 4-5 minutes. The object appeared to change course and speed, and at one time seemed to be maneuvering a circling pattern and then accelerate again. After about 4-5 minutes, the radar contact was lost. At no time was visual contact established.

The weather was overcast at 6,000 feet, with tops at 7,000 feet. Visibility good, but the base of the clouds was believed too low to have given a radar return.

The radar set in use was not operating satisfactorily, and "appeared to be erratic" with the scope presentation.

21 July 1952, F-94, 99946, pilot: Capt Norr J. Anthon, Jr., (0-2), Radar Observer:
At 21:32Z in the Selby Lake area, 61째25'1"N, 151째35'W, while at 13,000 feet, a radar contact was made at 16,000 yards. The radar contact was accomplished in 3-4 seconds, and the target was "locked on". It then disappeared from the radar scope. The pilot did not make visual contact, and the radar contact could not be re-established.
