PAGE 10 OF 24 PAGES

I. SOURCE: 
Address: Dallas, Texas
Occupation: Civil Engineer
Education: One year post graduate work

II. RELIABILITY: SOURCE's description of sighting was excellent and in great detail. THE OBJECT was visible to other persons and weather conditions were clear. SOURCE was very familiar with various jet propelled aircraft and their normal flight characteristics. He states the OBJECT was completely unfamiliar to him.

III. DETAILS OF SIGHTING:
The incident occurred on 29 June 1955 at approximately 2300 hours CST. SOURCE was at his residence in Dallas, Texas. He observed the OBJECT for a period of about 5-10 minutes.
The OBJECT appeared to be round, silvery white in color, and appeared to be revolving. The light traveled at a speed vastly greater than any jet aircraft known to SOURCE. The OBJECT made no noise. The light traveled in a straight line and would occasionally blink out, then reappear farther along its course. Viewing the OBJECT through binoculars, SOURCE could discern no details of structure other than its round, revolving shape. All lights were parallel to the flight path of the OBJECT. 
On the first pass, SOURCE only observed a white light, but he was not seeing the entire OBJECT. On the second pass, he observed the revolving silvery white OBJECT. The OBJECT seemed to be about the size of a car when viewed through binoculars.
3. OBSERVER stated that there was no moon present on the night of the observation, and weather conditions were clear.
4. The OBJECT seemed to be at an altitude of 7,000-8,000 feet, going east to west. All its movement was silent.
5. It is the opinion of the OBSERVER that the OBJECT seen was a phenomenon not capable of being produced by any known type of aircraft.
7. SOURCE estimated the length of the OBJECT to be three hundred feet. 
8. OBSERVER first sighted the OBJECT in the northeast.
