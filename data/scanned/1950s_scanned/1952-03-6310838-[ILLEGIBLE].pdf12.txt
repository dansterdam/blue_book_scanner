6. BRIEF SUMMARY OF SIGHTING
The man made a bright flash in the sky accompanied by a noise. The pilot said it was a bright red light, about the size of a dime at arm's length, and appeared to be about 10 to 12 miles away at an elevation of 12,000 feet or more. He said the light pulsated twice and then went out. No physical object could be seen. This could possibly cause flame or light.
