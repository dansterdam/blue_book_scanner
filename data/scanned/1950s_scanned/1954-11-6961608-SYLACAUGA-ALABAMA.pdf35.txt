AERO PRELIMINARY EVALUATION 2 December 1954

The UFO which struck the house in Sylacauga, Alabama on 30 Nov 54 was initially a meteorite, i.e. a meteoroid striking the earth's atmosphere. It showed a bright display of itself similar in appearance to those observed in 1872 and 1855 when the great meteors shot through the sky. The internal condition of the meteoroid which had a period of about 3.3 years shows that its orbit was the same as that of the cmomet or Giacobini-Zinner, which had a perihelion in 1946 and disappeared after 1952. The great showers or 1872 and 1885 occurred when the comet head disappeared. The same condition apply now. Only the remnants of the debris of the comet are seen: and it is possible to see members of the shower almost any time of the night. Only the brighter ones, however, could register their occurrence by an explosion during the daylight hours. Some are seen every year because the debris of the comet has been strewn along the whole path of the comet and the earth in its motion around the sun crosses the path of the come on 30 Nov each year.
