Short title - Light photographed over Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, August 6, 1952.

On August 6, 1952, William P. Coyne and Stephen A. Kozaik, both of Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, reported that they had photographed a "bright light" in the sky over Willow Grove.

The two observers stated that while walking in the vicinity of the Willow Grove Naval Air Station, they noticed a "bright light" in the sky to the southwest of their position. They immediately took a photograph of the object using a camera in their possession.

The resultant photograph shows a bright streak of light oriented roughly in a north-south direction. The observers indicated that the object was visible to the naked eye for about 10 minutes during which time the photograph was taken. The photograph was secured and forwarded to the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for analysis.

At the time of the incident, Project Blue Book was the Air Force's system for collecting, evaluating, and reporting on all information relating to unidentified flying objects. The photograph, along with the observer's report, was submitted for technical analysis.

Analysis of the Photographic Evidence:

The analysis indicated that the photograph depicted a real physical phenomenon and not merely a photographic defect or anomaly. The bright streak of light was consistent with the description provided by the observers.

Possible Explanations:

The analysts at ATIC considered several possible explanations for the observed phenomenon:

1) Meteor - The orientation and appearance of the light streak was consistent with that of a meteor or similar celestial phenomenon. Meteor showers were common in the area at the time.

2) Aircraft - The possibility that the light was caused by an aircraft, such as a jet or missile, was considered. However, no known aircraft were reported in the area at the time.

3) Satellite - The possibility that the light was caused by an artificial satellite was examined, but no satellite activity was reported in the region.

Conclusion:

After careful consideration of the photographic evidence and the observer reports, the analysts at ATIC were unable to determine a definitive explanation for the observed phenomenon. The photograph was determined to be an authentic depiction of an unidentified flying object, and the case was filed in the Project Blue Book archives for further study and investigation as warranted.

The Blue Book staff requested that the observers continue to be alert for any further sightings or additional information that could aid in resolving this case.
