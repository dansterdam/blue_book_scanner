The image contains a photograph of an unidentified object or craft in the sky. The document appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, and it includes meteorological data and information about radar interference observed on November 8, 1952.

PART I. 5. Yes. Interference from other radar sets has been observed. For that reason the transmitting frequency was changed during the observation. After changing the frequency to 20 me lower, the target in question became indistinct. Interference with the effects and appearance of "noise" was present.

PART II. 2. The weather data given below was furnished by a USAF Weather Unit attached to the 543rd Air Division (Defense), Keesler AFB, N Mexico.

Time/date of sounding
02002 5 November 1952
(2000 MST 8 Nov 1952)

ALTITUDE  TEMPERATURE  WIND DIR/VELOCITY  HUMIDITY
30,000 ft MSL - 42° F 260/80 kns  very dry
35,000 ft MSL - 48° F 260/80 kns extremely dry
40,000 ft MSL - 56° F 260/80 kns extremely dry

Twelve hours after this WX report an inversion occurred between 20,000 and 40,000 ft MSL. Upper air weather is given for the above altitudes because of est. max. altitude of target. Weather below 20,000 ft MSL was clear and dry.
