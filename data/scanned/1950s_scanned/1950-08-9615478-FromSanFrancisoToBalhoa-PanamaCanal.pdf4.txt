Meteors in the Records

The American Meteorites Society, whose members specialise in the study of meteors and meteorites, for years have collected reports of such phenomena. From a large enough number of good descriptions of a given meteor, astronomers can analyze the data mathematically and determine the meteor's radiant—the point in the heavens from which it seems to come. The meteor is then identified by its radiant and given an AMS number. The data were published in Meteorites, the journal of the society, and thus made available for future research.

During the years 1950 to 1955 the records show some fine examples of fireballs, many of them green, that were somehow overlooked by saucer enthusiasts. On August 11, 1950, during the maximum of the Perseid shower, a blue-green fireball (AMS 2336) apparently oval or cigar-shaped, appeared over Washington, Oregon, and Idaho at 7:30 P.M. and was reported by more than 100 witnesses. So brilliant that it showed a noticeable glow in a horizontal path, silently broke into three pieces, and disappeared.

September 23, 1953, was a big day for meteors. At 1:35 A.M., a giant fireball (AMS 2358) roared over southeastern Illinois from north to south, leaving a luminous train visible in five states and illuminating the sky and countryside from St. Louis to Louisville. The final detonation, over western Kentucky, was heard over an area 1000 miles square and shook buildings from Paducah to Memphis. Fragments showed penetrated farms over a twenty-five mile area, struck five buildings, and showered pounds of meteorites dropped in Murray, Calloway County, Kentucky, and are now in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. That same night about 10:45 P.M. fireballs were reported by plane crews flying over a six-state area—Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico [p. 115]. Similar fireballs that vanished without trace were reported on September 28, 1953 (AMS 2351); October 4, 1953 (AMS 2339); May 15, 1954; and October 27, 1954 (AMS 2337).
