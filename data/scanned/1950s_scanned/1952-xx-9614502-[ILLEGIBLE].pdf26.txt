After watching the object for a period of time I became convinced that I was not seeing any sort of conventional aircraft, as its movements and behavior were unlike anything I had ever observed before. It gave off no distinctive sound or exhaust, and was obviously under intelligent control. I cannot explain what I saw, but am certain that it was a phenomenonborderline the spectrum of our normal existence. I have told of this experience to only a few persons, as I realize how fantastic such an occurrence might seem to others. I nonetheless remain convinced that what I saw was real and that there is much to learn yet about the nature of the universe in which we live.
