Dear Mr. Hennessey:

I refer to your inquiry concerning the sighting of Mrs. William Fitzgerald of Sheffield lake, Ohio, concerning an unidentified flying object on 21 September 1958.

Air Force investigators arrived in Sheffield, Ohio, on 3 October 1958, conducted an investigation, and took statements of the witnesses to possibly evaluate this sighting.

Investigation revealed that a peculiar event was seen in the home of Mrs. Fitzgerald. The edge of Mrs. Fitzgerald's illuminating a small square on the ground at approximately the same hour of the reported sighting. The train had a rotating headlight which, under some conditions, would produce unusual effects. However, the train was actually over 2 miles away from the location of the Lorial Case. Chief Schott reported that he was using his spotlight in an attempt to attract the attention of a another ship, and that the light was directed towards the ground.

Conclusion: Air Force investigators did not find this sighting to be of sufficient significance for further investigation.
