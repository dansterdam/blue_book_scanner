The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. 

The first sketch shows an illustration of how an object appeared above the horizon (skyline) when it was first seen, and how high the object was above the horizon when it was last seen. The sketch has a curved line drawn to illustrate this.

The second sketch shows a larger view of the scene, with two sketches. The larger one depicts a road or street leading into the distance, with mountains or hills in the background. The smaller inset sketch shows a person standing in the foreground with a semicircular horizon in the background.
