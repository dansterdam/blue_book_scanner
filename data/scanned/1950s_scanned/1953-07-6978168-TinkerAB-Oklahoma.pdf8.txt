The image appears to be a hand-drawn diagram or schematic, likely from an old Project Blue Book UFO report. There is no photograph present in this particular image.

Now I will act as an OCR system and extract all the text found in the document:

"Contrails round, shiny objects"
"27 41'"
"27 41'"
"Times shown were 2020 hrs - about this same period duration of 1050 hrs. Duration of the sighting was about 5-10 minutes."
"Suppose radar true indication."
"38 34/1/50"
