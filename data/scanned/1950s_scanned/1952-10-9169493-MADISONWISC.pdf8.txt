STATEMENT

On Thursday, 30 October 1952, I, Lewis E. Goar was standing guard on gate #1 at 1035 when I spotted an unidentified aircraft traveling in the direction of west south-west at a high speed. The object had the form of an egg and a blue cast to it. It was flying at eight (8) to ten (10) thousand feet and climbing steadily. I watched it for about 15 to 20 seconds until it disappeared in a haze. I/We Jones and I then reported the incident to the Air Police Operations Section.
