February 23, 1953

Mr. Miles E. Goll
Box 9572
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Ohio

Dear Mr. Goll:

This letter report describes progress for the period from January 11, 1952 to February 10, 1953.

Sighting reports have now been processed up to and including October 15, 1952. Evaluation of sighting reports has been completed for sightings up to and including July 31, 1952.

Preliminary analysis by IBM machines of data from sighting reports for the period before February 26, 1953 is continuing, and results of the analysis will be forwarded informally to you as available.

One two-day evaluation conference was held during this report period, on February 23 and 24, 1953, because only one USAF representative was available to participate in the conference. Less than the normal number of work-days was accomplished. (Usually 150 to 200 cases can be evaluated during a two-day evaluation conference.) On January 22 and 23, 1953, some cases were evaluated during a two-day evaluation conference.

Coding and evaluation of 1952 sighting reports is continuing. All sighting reports remaining for the year 1952 should be processed by March 15, 1953. By that same date, all sighting reports dated prior to September 1, 1952 are expected to be evaluated.

Very truly yours,

William T. Reid
Supervisor
