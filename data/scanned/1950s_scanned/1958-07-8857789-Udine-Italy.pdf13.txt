Symbols for order of brightness:
yellow, green, blue and violet, above. But because the sun projects the brightness of 
these colors as white, we are often deceived. As a matter of fact the sun is not white at all, but a very pure and brilliant yellow.
All the planets, except the earth, are self-luminous. They give off light of their own. But as they become a part of the distance, their light becomes purer, and the colors become more pronounced. As the planets are farther away from us, they are bent downwards so much that they appear to rise and set just like the sun and moon.

State University show many irregularities in the earth's surface. Dr. Weikko A. Heiskanen, head of the Geodetio Institute, estimates an underwater mountain range of the Mid-Atlantic rift valley, and the Mariana Trench.
