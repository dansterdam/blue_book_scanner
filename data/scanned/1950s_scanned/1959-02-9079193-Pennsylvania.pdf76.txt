TEXT OUTPUT:

Dear Mr. Tacker:

The reports in the newspapers that we carry on our DCA747, 707 and other aircraft were caused by a C-band radar on the aircraft. This radar was installed to detect thunder clouds and avoid them . It is entirely for that purpose and has nothing whatever to do with the detection of other aircraft.

The presence of other aircraft at this time is valueless in respect of the presence of the unidentified radar blips seen by the pilot's radar set. We have found that in most collision evasion measures it is difficult to determine the presence or absence of other aircraft in the vicinity, even during the day-time operation of the radar set.

Unfortuantely, this equipment gives indications as if it were to be man-made objects through natural radar reflections. Our operations and technical analysis indicates that this equipment has no capability to detect anything other than thunder storms. This is accepted by expert Air Force opinions. 

We trust this letter formally replies to your question. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sincerely,
FRANKLIN W. KACKER
