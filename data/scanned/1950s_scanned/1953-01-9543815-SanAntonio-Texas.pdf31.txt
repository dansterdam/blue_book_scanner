STATEMENT

On 9 January 1953 at approximately 1:15 hours, I was riding home in a car operated by Mrs. [REDACTED], Miss [REDACTED] was also a passenger in the car. We drove North on Zarzamora Street and had just stopped for a traffic light at the intersection of Monterrey and Zarzamora Streets when I noticed an unusual object in the sky off to our left. I called this to the attention of Mrs. [REDACTED] and Miss [REDACTED], and as we observed it, the object streaked across our path and continued on a course due East. The object appeared to be flying a little higher than ordinary airplanes and was somewhat faster. After the object crossed in front of us, it gradually veered off in a Northerly direction and disappeared, much as it went behind a cloud. Only there were no clouds in the sky. The object was round and was of a silverish shiny color. I would estimate the size to be comparable to that of a fifteen inch diameter ball observed from ten feet.

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
