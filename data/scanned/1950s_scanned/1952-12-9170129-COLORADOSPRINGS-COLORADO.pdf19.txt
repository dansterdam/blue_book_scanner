On Dec. 4, 1952, at approximately 11:30 p.m., my attention was called to a strange object in the sky over COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO.  A round, luminous object was observed moving slowly from west to east. It was observed for a period of approximately 45 minutes. Size: - 600 to 800 yards in diameter. Speed: 20 to 25 miles per hour. Course: 11:30 am. Weather: Clear, warm, no wind. 25 degree elevation, 330 degree azimuth. The object appeared to be oscillating or pulsating and would change in size and brilliance at irregular intervals. Without any apparent sound or trail, it finally disappeared in the east.
