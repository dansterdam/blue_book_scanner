Col. G. L. Holtman, Jr.
Chief of Staff
Fort Carson, Colorado.

Dear Colonel:-

Yours of 12 January 1956 regarding the flying machine my rear brakeman and myself saw one mile east of Sibilette on date of 13-8-55. Yes, it was a harbor shop about the size of fishing boat (one inch and a quarter for five minutes work) and we found that its picture is on form 10 as a natural color slide and negative or a silhouette of it). the picture is described to you xxxxxxxxxxxx and is much like the design of your aircraft.

Here is an exact picture of the outfit we saw getting over those quakes we saw in project blue book pictures. The way I remember it, this appears in the attached picture the same and we were close enough to see that the pipes were square instead of round.

The little description below the big picture says that this cut fit is very much alike to think they must have gotten out of the same mold to show one has the little tubes come out the side and we will inform the Air Force base in Colorado Springs that a gob and find out just what kind of outfit this outfit is related up to 70 or 75 air miles from Los Alamos.

I will let you all the luck in the world at your new station and will just forward to the day when I can see you again. Tell Von "hello" and with the very best of regards.

I remain,

Sincerely yours,

Box 5,
Alamosa, Colorado.
