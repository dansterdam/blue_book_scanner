AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

ID-UFOB-1
PAGE 10 OF 12 PAGES

COMMENTS of Preparing Officer:
None

COMMENTS of Approving Officer:
It is the opinion of this headquarters that this sighting was caused by the planet Venus, which was visible during daylight hours in the approximate area as described.

1. The object was described by all observers as being like a bright star. One observer stated that the object was stationary and caused by a celestial body.

2. Although the observers' aircraft traveled many miles during the sighting, the closing time between the object and the aircraft was great distance from the observers.

3. Mention of the timing of the sighting coupled with the distance traveled by the observers' aircraft would preclude the possibility of a balloon.

Lt. Colonel, USAF
Flight Leader of the Thunderbird, and an observer of the object in question, stated that the object was experienced this sighting and was illuminated by a diffuse light, but too far away to determine its size or shape.
