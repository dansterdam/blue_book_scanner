Dear Major Gradrom,

My best wishes for your good health. If you will recall my former conversation regarding a central point for forwarded information.

Enclosed are three sketches (rough) on the matter. I have others on hand - but forwarded only those which were observed recently for 5-6 nights. Have also inquired also that were not exhibited due to my not-realizing that others were to follow.

I hope I have not wasted your time, and that these may be of some interest to this at Hamilton Field.

Thanking you for your help & consideration,
Yours truly
