When I first saw these objects, the front one was almost in back of the other two - they moved side into a position to make a perfect triangle.
The objects had no illumination whatever, and had no sound, it moved very slowly.
I am sure that they were not any reflections, because they were too clear.
They went in front of a star and you could see the star all the way through it as while show you can in the diagram below.
