There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book, containing text and a chart or diagram.

The text reads:

. Practically, attach to this pare the reaction of a local area chart which shows the location of the sighting.
On this chart plot the flight path of your aircraft and the flight path of the object.
If a local area chart is not available, roughly sketch in the area the sighting occurred, where the object was first seen, its path of flight, and where it disappeared from view. Mark as necessary.
