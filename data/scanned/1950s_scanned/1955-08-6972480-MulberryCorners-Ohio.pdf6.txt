Case File Number Three

On September 20, 1955 I received a letter from one Mrs. ******* of Cleveland which stated that she had visited with a young man who had had an amazing experience. She went on to say that this fellow told only his mother, his priests and her about the event but that he wanted to talk with someone who knows about such things. Soon after, I accompanied two other UFO investigators to Mrs. ******* home where the interview was to take place. With the witness' okay we recorded the complete interview with a dictaphone.

A door slid open in this aircraft, some kind of platform came out, and a man, with something resembling a ski suit on, emerged from the object. This man told me not to be afraid, that 'they' had landed there to be discovered but didn't expect anyone to find them so soon. He told me to tell a high official or somebody with governmental authority in Washington that 'they' were from another planet and that there were more wars here to 'them' would have to take over.
