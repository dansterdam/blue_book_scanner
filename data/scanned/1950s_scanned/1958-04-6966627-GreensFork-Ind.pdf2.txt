Dear Mr. Strah:

This is a small part that I had forgotten about in my collection. I'm not sure that it is metal. 

Mr. Strah, I do have the possible pot of gold. It is more of a collectors item than metal. With your permission I would like to turn it in for money. This newspaper clipping explains how the gold spillout out as the star came into the atmosphere. It may be a bit radio-active as a lot of the places are.
