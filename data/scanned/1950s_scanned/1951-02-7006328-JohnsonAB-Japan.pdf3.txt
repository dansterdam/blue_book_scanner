AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

Headquarters 314th Air Division, TIR-OI-I/GC-I-SI

8. The Tactical Control Center had good contact with the F-82 but at no time did another blip appear on the scope.

9. The time of release of the weather balloon suggests that it was a "pyrothal" type balloon which is equipped with a candle or something as an electric light that can be seen in the darkness for 30,000 feet on the ground during a three-hour period.

10. The sudden change of position of the light from nine (9) o'clock level to two (2) o'clock high may be attributed to looking at an approaching bright star. The star may have disappeared behind a cloud or have caused the observation of a light which was rapidly with one of nature.

11. The Tactical Control Center, while having good contact with the aircraft, would not be able to detect the balloon on their radar screens.

12. The position of the aircraft at the time the pilot and radar observer lost sight of the light and the position of the balloon at the time the ground observers lost sight of the light are approximately the same.

13. A check by the 6152nd Air Base Wing indicated that there were no other aircraft airborne in the area other than the one mentioned.

14. This headquarters concurs in the evaluation as placed on this report by Lt. Charles Ford, Intelligence Officer, 6152nd Air Base Wing, Lt. Colonel DeLa is the originator. The intelligence officer and continuing exercises sound and ensure judgment in the handling of this matter.
