Air Force Set To Study 3 of 46 Objects
United States Air Force, at the MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, reportedly has set aside a special team to study more than 3 out of 46 'unusual flying objects' that were observed in the sky over Florida and Alabama on November 2, 1957. And, besides public reports, the Air Force said the command has received information on the objects from reliable private sources, but only three in number are to be studied at this time.
The newspaper article further states that the objects were observed and reported by persons and from reliable public sources in the Tampa area, some of the objects being described as cigar-shaped and moving at a high rate of speed. One report said the command had 'locked on' one of the objects for study by radar but it did not remain stationary long enough for detailed observation and the object disappeared from the radar screen. The article says the command has received other reports of the objects being seen in the sky but apparently is investigating only three in detail at this time, according to the report. The article says those three objects were observed over a 5-state area, including Florida, Alabama, Georgia and Louisiana. In one case a police officer near Tallahassee, Florida, said he saw a bright object cross the sky which emitted a bluish-green light. The air force command, according to the report, said the three objects would be studied under standard investigatile procedures.
