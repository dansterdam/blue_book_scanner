translation and transcription from reports to punched cards, indicated that there could be no really meaningful correlation studies. Either the original data or reports would seriously reduce the sample of a specific variable.

Preliminary tabulations of various sortings substantiated the impossibility of deriving statistical results from certain variables, such as movement of the observer during the sighting, sound, shape parameter, size, angular velocity and acceleration, appearance and disappearance, bearing, initial and final elevation, altitude, and orientation of the object. The statistically usable variables presented in this study include the date, time, location, duration, reliability, and method of observation of the sighting, and the physical attributes of luminosity, color, speed, shape, light brightness, and identification of the objects sighted.

The presentation of frequency and percentage distributions of any of the variables must be interpreted in the light of the sample of incidents represented, as the objects sighted, based on ALL SIGHTINGS, could lead to misrepresentation and distortion of the results, because of the multiplicity of reports on some of the phenomena. On the other hand, the percentage distributions reported by each observer is more likely to be correct than a distribution based on one report for each phenomenon. To assure that the results nearly correct presentation was made, and to avoid the possibility of failure to uncover any pattern or trend inherent in the data, the variables were studied on five different bases or samples. These samples, and their numerical relation to each other, were as follows:

ALL SIGHTINGS (all reports)                        - 3,201 cards
UNIT SIGHTINGS, all observers                  - 2,554 cards
UNIT SIGHTINGS, single observer                - 2,232 cards
UNIT SIGHTINGS, multiple observers            - 322 cards
OBJECT SIGHTINGS                                  - 2,199 cards

The preliminary tabulations indicated that the samples based on UNIT SIGHTINGS, single observers, and UNIT SIGHTINGS, multiple observers, would not add materially to this study. Accordingly, although the frequency distributions were recognized and are available for study, they are not presented in this report.

The bases of ALL SIGHTINGS, UNIT SIGHTINGS (referring to all observers), and OBJECT SIGHTINGS are presented in Appendix A as Tables A1 through A240. A critical study of these tabulations reveals that there is no apparent change in the distribution of any variable from one basis to another, and that no marked patterns or trends exist in any sample.
