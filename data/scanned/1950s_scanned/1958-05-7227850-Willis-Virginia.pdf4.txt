The provided image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a handwritten letter or document from Project Blue Book, a historical U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Text in the document:

"Hey, Sarge:
Air Technical Intelligence Center - Wright - Patterson AFB - Dayton - Ohio
Dear Sirs:
I am sending, under separate cover (the Continued) a few strips of film that fell near my home around the 13-14th of May. They apparently fell at night and I wonder if you could tell me what they are. Could these pieces have come from weather instruments - sent aloft or from something else?
I hope this finds you more than a little pleased - I am sending you another "printick" caller of others and tough on one side that appear to have been peeled off from another surface. Thought perhaps you would be interested in these.
Sincerely,"

The document appears to describe the sender witnessing some kind of UFO-related incident involving fallen debris near their home in May, and they are submitting samples to the Air Technical Intelligence Center for analysis and identification.
