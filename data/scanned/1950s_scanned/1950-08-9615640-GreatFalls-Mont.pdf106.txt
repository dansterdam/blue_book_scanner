DEAR MR. KENNEDY:

THIS WILL APPLY TO YOUR QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE OBSERVATION OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA BY MR. ROBERT B. WESTFORD, GREAT FALLS, MONTANA, ON 12 AUGUST 1950. I UNDERSTAND FROM THE INFORMATION PROVIDED THAT THIS CASE WAS PROCESSED AND REFERRED TO YOU FOR CONSIDERATION.

(1) THIS CASE CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE AIR FORCE BY A LETTER FROM THE GREAT FALLS LEADER, GREAT FALLS, MONTANA DATED SEPTEMBER 1950. 

(2) MR. WESTFORD WAS INTERVIEWED BY AN OFFICER FROM A NEARBY AIR FORCE ORGANIZATION. INFORMATION WAS SUBMITTED BY HIM VOLUNTARILY.

(3) ON 12 AUGUST 1950, STARTING ABOUT 2230 HOURS, MR. WESTFORD OBSERVED TWO STRANGE LIGHTS IN THE SKY. HE WATCHED THEM FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES, CONCLUDING THAT THEY WERE NOT AIRCRAFT, SINCE THEIR FLIGHT PATH AND CHARACTERISTICS DIFFERED FROM THOSE OF KNOWN AIRCRAFT. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS LAST TIME MENTIONED WAS OBTAINED FROM A NARRATIVE STATEMENT PREPARED BY MR. WESTFORD, WHICH IS NOT A DIRECT QUESTION OF STANDARD OBSERVATION FORM.

(4) NO PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE OBJECTS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN AND IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR EXAMINATION.

(5) CONCLUSION AS TO PROBABLE CAUSE OF SIGHTING IN THIS CASE IS: UNKNOWN.
