Major Quintanilla

Page 4
November 4, 1957, Elmwood Park, Ill., Sighting 

The similarity to the Loveland case is striking and if we can believe (I think we can) that they were unaware of the Loveland sighting at the time they made theirs; it becomes all the more interesting. The object definitely passed in front of objects from time to time and the object could not be seen through the light. The object, or the illumination, was not transparent. 

No sound or noise was ever associated with the object. It seemed to glow and its color was compared by both men to the color of a setting sun, but not as bright. 

It is unfortunate that the incident did not occur to witnesses better trained as observers, and more articulate ones. 

Other small items: _____ said that his "hair stood on end" when he saw the object, and the other officer said _____ wanted to shoot at it, but was cautioned by Officer _____ not to shoot until he knew more about it. 

Meteorological conditions for this night should be checked to be compared with similar data from Loveland. Likewise, comparison should be made with the Lock Raven Dam case and the Swiss equivalent of the Lock Raven Dam case which occurred just two or three days before the Lock Raven Dam case. 

I would recommend that all cases of luminous globes of light which apparently do not appear to be attached to a tangible object be collected and be examined for similarities of behavior and ambient conditions. We may have here, and I say just possibly may, have an indication of something new in atmospheric physics. Cases should be limited, however, to more than one-witness cases. 

This case should not be closed until I have a chance to talk with _____ . I have a feeling that he may provide something which will either strongly corroborate the above or throw it out of court. 

Sincerely,
