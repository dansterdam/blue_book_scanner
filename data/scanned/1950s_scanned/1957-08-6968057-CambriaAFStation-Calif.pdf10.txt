Here is the text from the document:

34. Have you completed this questionnaire?
Yes

35. Information which you feel pertinent and which is not adequately covered in the specific points of this questionnaire or a narrative explanation of your sighting.

Flight have told me to come in and give a report on what I had seen. They have told me that there were two sightings of UFO's in this area. The object I saw was approximately 70-80 feet in diameter and was hovering at about 1500 feet. It appeared to have a greenish-white color and there were no visible means of propulsion. The object remained in the same general area for about 15 minutes and then took off at a high rate of speed in a northerly direction. I am certain that what I saw was not a jet, helicopter, or any other type of aircraft I am familiar with. I have been in the Air Force for over 10 years and have never seen anything like this before. I have no explanation for what I saw.
