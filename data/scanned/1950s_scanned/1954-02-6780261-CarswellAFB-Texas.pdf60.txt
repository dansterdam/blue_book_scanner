At 2320 CST observed 8 blips on scope about
12 mi. SW. Big % of blips were normal for a
C-47 in formation flying 050º. After 1 minute
2 blips merged and flew about 1 mile, then
separated again and were about ½ to 2 mile apart,
They then turned north and after traveling north
about 1 minute one blip reversed course without
making a visible turn. the target held this
northward heading about 45 seconds, then reversed
course and flew south showing catching
up with the other Target I saw north
