MATTO T. MEARES, RESIDENT
907 SOUTH VALMONT STREET
DEL RIO, TEXAS
November 6, 1957

Dear Sirs:

I am writing to report an observation of an unidentified flying object which I and several other persons observed in the vicinity of Del Rio, Texas, on the night of November 5, 1957, at 10:30 p.m.

The object was first sighted by Mrs. Meares as she was looking out of a window in our home. She called my attention to it, and I immediately went outside to observe it. The object was hovering in the sky, about 2,000 feet in altitude, and was approximately 75 feet in diameter. It appeared to be a large, lighted, disc-shaped object. The object then made a sharp turn toward the south, then back north and remained in the same general area for several minutes. The object then proceeded to move rapidly upward and out of sight.

In addition to Mrs. Meares and myself, the following persons also observed the object: Mrs. Bertha Wisehart, and Mr. Everett Wisehart, Mr. and Mrs. C.B. Wisehart, and their three children. All five persons who observed the object are local residents and are known to me to be reliable and reputable citizens.

I am submitting this report to you as I feel that the object was definitely not an airplane, satellite, or any known conventional aircraft. I would appreciate any information you may be able to provide regarding this observation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely yours,
MATTO T. MEARES
