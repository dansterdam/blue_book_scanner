This is.. to report a sighting of a bright red object observed by myself and others in the Cincinnati, Ohio area on the night of 7 September 1956. The object was observed from approximately 9:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. EDT. The object was first observed in the northern sky, traveling in a southerly direction at a very high rate of speed. It appeared to be very bright red in color and was visible for approximately 20 to 30 seconds before disappearing from sight. It was observed by myself and at least 6 other persons.
