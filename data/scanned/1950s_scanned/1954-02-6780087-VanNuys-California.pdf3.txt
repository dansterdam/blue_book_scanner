1. On 6 FEBRUARY 1954, [REDACTED] reported an incident of having seen a "flying object" on 5 FEBRUARY 1954 near Van Nuys, California.
2. DETAILS: On 5 FEBRUARY 1954, at approximately 8:15 P.M., [REDACTED] and his wife were driving in their car on the Ventura Freeway near the intersection of the Sepulveda Boulevard off-ramp, Van Nuys, California, when they observed an object hovering in the sky. He stated that the object appeared to be circular in shape, was quite bright, and was flashing intermittently. The object hovered for some time and then sped away at a tremendous rate of speed, disappearing into the night sky.
3. There were no other witnesses besides [REDACTED] and his wife. The Investigator interviewed them on 16 FEBRUARY 1954, and their story was consistent in all details. They are considered to be reliable and credible individuals. The object was observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. It was about the size of a basketball, judging from the apparent size in the sky, and was estimated to be at an altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The weather was clear at the time of the observation.
4. From the details given, this incident appears to be another in the series of "unidentified flying objects" reported in the area. The object described is similar in appearance and behavior to those reported on previous occasions. The Investigator was unable to determine any logical explanation for the phenomenon observed.
