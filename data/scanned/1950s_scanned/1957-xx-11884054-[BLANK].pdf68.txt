REMARKS: Doctor, I hate to burden you with my trouble, but I must. However, here is one reason why I have been working Saturdays and Sundays for the last 4 months. As you know, General Lewis 30 minute brief each Wednesday, shakes the place up for 5 days in order to prepare for it. This requires almost a haif hours work, which sometimes of this order requires weeks of preparation. I was given a classified research project with a time limit, which required more work than I expected, and it had to be given Monday afternoon, which it was, practically from 1 to 5:30 every day, and the majority of Saturday and Sunday for lunch, to carry out the work. All remains to be done as theeffect it eases or to "stop worrying" (generally from people who do not know or will not take time out over) FROM NAME OR TITLE DATE
