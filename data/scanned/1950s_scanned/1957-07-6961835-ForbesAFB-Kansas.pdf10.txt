"The case of the LCVP turning: ECP 53 - 2032 was started on their call, when someone spotted from the ground what appeared to be an LCVP (Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel) turning and maneuvering over Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas, on 18 May 1957. Visual observation and radar tracking indicated that the object was at an altitude of over 20,000 feet and traveling at a speed of over 300 knots. This was an unidentified flying object. It was tracked for some twenty-five minutes before it disappeared from radar.

The major portion of the report deals with observations received from the radar station at Forbes AFB, Kansas. It indicates that the object was sighted visually and tracked on radar for approximately 25 minutes. The object was estimated to be at an altitude of over 20,000 feet and traveling at a speed in excess of 300 knots. The object disappeared from radar when it reached a point approximately 20 miles south of the base.

The radar scope photographs of the object were taken and forwarded to Air Technical Intelligence Center. The report has been reviewed and it is concluded that the object was an unidentified flying object."
