INFORMATION FROM MR DENNIS HURST, POSTMASTER OF MARIETTA, OHIO

During a telephone call from M/Sgt Bluemel to the Postmaster the following information was given:

Mr Hurst stated that approximately one year ago an official telegram came from Denver Colorado, to the post office of Marietta, Ohio. The Postmaster knowing that the Source had no telephone number took it to his house and tried to deliver the message. Upon his arriving the Postmaster heard the radio playing and knocked on the door. The radio was shut off but no-one came to the door. The Postmaster knowing that some-one was home knocked at the door again. Eventually Source came to the door and inquired who was there. The Postmaster identified himself and stated that he had an official telegram from Denver Colorado addressed to the Source and asked Source to open the door. Source refused to open the door so the Postmaster departed without delivering the message. The Postmaster then went to the neighbors' and asked what type of man lived there and why he wouldn't open the door. He was told by the neighbors that the person living there was a "Queer Character" who kept the blinds closed all day and never left the house. The Postmaster then reported this incident to the Marietta City Police.

After receiving this information the sheriff was asked to contact the City Police Dept. to see if this incident had been recorded. No entry of this incident was found the officer on duty at that time.
