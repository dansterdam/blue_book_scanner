on 27 April 1952:

Mr.                      Royal Oak, Michigan, phone               1, talked
to the undersigned concerning flying saucer he saw at approximately 1100 hours, 27
April 1952. He said he saw a small white object very high in the sky. It looked
like a paper plate. As he watched it, it turned sideways. It seemed to be stationary.
Mr.                            reported he went into the house to get his binoculars and when he came out,
it was gone. He called a neighbor as a witness, but the neighbor could not see it.
