AS DISCUSSED IN SOME DETAIL WITH AN ASTRONOMER ATTACHED TO THE AMC GRADUATE CENTER AS A RESULT OF THIS DISCUSSION IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT WHILE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF THE OBJECT SIGHTED BEING A METEOR OR DISPERSION TRAIL DESCRIBED ABOVE GIVES NO CLUE AS TO WHETHER THIS MAY BE UNUSUAL. IN ANY EVENT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT THE AIRCRAFT SAW WHAT IS DESCRIBED UNLESS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS RECEIVED WHICH WOULD TEND TO CHANGE OUR ESTIMATE OF THE SITUATION.
