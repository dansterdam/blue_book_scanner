AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: (REGION) 2  

REPORT NO. 1952 - 7 - 7481848  

PAGE 1 OF 2

1. One 24,000 ft long cylindrical object was detected by radar. The object was caught on the permanent radar and a number of times on height finding radar. The object was between 10,000 and 20,000 ft high. It was too dark to visually see any detail of the object.

2. The object was not detected by the radar of the nearest Air Force base between the hours of 1900 and 0700. The object appeared to be traveling slowly and on a level course between approximately 190° and 205°. There was no aircraft or meteorological data to substantiate this sighting.

3. This sighting was logged through the military and civilian chain of command. No attempt was made to confirm or further investigate this incident until the next day, 7 July 52, at which time no further traces of the object could be found. A study of the permanent radar record was made the following day, but no definite conclusion could be reached as to the nature of the object.

4. The report indicates that the observation was made from an FAA approach control site. Altitude and bearing were obtained from radar. The duration of the sighting was from approximately 0540 to 0600 hours, or about 20 minutes. The object was in sight during this entire period and was observed by at least 3 operators.
