future when the work load diminished. Mr. Scott requested formal

the study is completed all photographic and tape recordings would
be sent to the Air Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson. Prior to departing
RADC, the project files were reviewed. Major Landy advised that
access to the files had not been requested by any periodicals.
On 28 August 1951, the subject was discussed informally with
Dr. Lincoln La Paz, who expressed disbelief in all aerial phenomena
except for the green fire-balls. The red fire-ball occasionally reappeared as believed was the visual after-effects of the green. Their
