Aircraft control order
wanted to report priority, new mexico,"as previously wish to make"

At 0716 on 30 april 1952, I received A/C which was passed from a primary at 2752 ft. At 0716 MSgt I sighted a blip on my PPI scope at 7.8 miles NE of the field. It was moving very fast, approximately 1500 mph. I attempted to scramble a jet but the aircraft was no longer in range. The blip faded from my scope at 2752 ft. I was unable to locate the object on my radar. It appeared to be flying at an altitude of 2752 ft. To the best of my knowledge, this was not interference.

Attached hereon is the approximate path of flight, the blip was in.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 30th day of April 1952.
