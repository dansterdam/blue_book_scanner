STATEMENT
The object was first sighted on 26 Feb 53 at 2115/T. One bright star-like object, 1.5 to 2 degrees in diameter, was observed at 40 degrees above the horizon bearing 320 degrees from the observer. It was the shape of a star with a very clear and distinct outline. There was no noticeable movement during the 10 seconds of observation. Then the object disappeared instantly without any noticeable trail or exhaust. There was no sound of any aerodynamic features, although there was a very dim light source from the object. It was on a constant southwardly course and seemed to be at an altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. It was first sighted at 2130/T with the color ranging from white to blue-white. The object appeared to be the size of a small aircraft but had no visible structure or outline that would indicate a conventional aircraft. It made no sound and had no exhaust trail. During the sighting, the weather was very clear and calm.
