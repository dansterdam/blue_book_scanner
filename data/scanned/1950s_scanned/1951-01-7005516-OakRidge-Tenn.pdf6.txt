The image does not contain any photographic elements. It appears to be a page from a declassified document related to Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

HEADQUARTERS
AIR MATERIEL COMMAND
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE
DAYTON, OHIO

SUBJECT: Unconventional Aircraft, ATI Project No. 10073

TO: Director of Intelligence
Headquarters, USAF
ATTN: Evaluation Division
Technical Capabilities Branch
Washington 25, D.C.

1. It is considered highly probable that the radar target detected three times by the airborne aircraft on 21 January was a ground target in the vicinity of the Y-12 plant.

2. The peculiar phenomena of having the target first appear at an altitude above the interceptor and then below the aircraft is considered to be due to abnormal refraction or the radar shadow effect. Under these conditions, the target was lost to the radar when the temperature and/or moisture duct that was located at about the same altitude as the interceptor closed on the target.

3. A check with the local A.W.S. office indicates that the Nashville weather station reported the following temperature data for 200 EST, 21 January 1951:

Altitude     Temperature Conditions
0 to 2000 ft       No Change
2000 to 5000 ft    Six degrees increase
5000 to 8000 ft    Normal decrease in temp/increased altitude
8000 to 11000 ft   Three degree increase
Above 11000 ft     Normal decrease in temp/increased altitude

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
