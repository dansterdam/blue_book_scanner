SUBJECT: Photographs of UFO (Mrs. (redacted))

TO: ATIC/ADAA

1. The subject photography has been examined but no conclusion can be reached as to the cause of the apparent circular images. Possible causes are an instrument aberration, double exposure, or some sort of reflection if the photograph is the product of a wide-angle lens processing, or less likely, a deliberate double exposure.

2. It is suggested that the photograph be shown to an expert on photographic processing, or less re-processing.
