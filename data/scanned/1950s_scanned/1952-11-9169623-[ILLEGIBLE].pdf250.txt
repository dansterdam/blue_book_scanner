At first I thought it was a rather remarkable form of an unusual nature and description of movement, as it did appear to be a dark massive object with a perimelinical and erratic movement, somewhat of a jagged vertical and horizontal path which seemed to be of a somewhat erratic nature. I cannot determine at this time as to whether it was an aircraft or some other type of machine. But it did produce a dark and massive effect which seemed to only coincide with a small dimension of a sphere type appearance. This is all that I can say with any positive assurance at the present moment. As to the nature of the object, I cannot determine.
