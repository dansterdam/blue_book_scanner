STATEMENT OF WITNESSES

1. BPR HARVEY
Satsuma, Alabama

On 17 August 1953 at 2055 M local time, I was standing near Highway 43 approximately 100 yards south of the Satsuma Drug Store in Satsuma, Alabama. With my brother, we were looking for a little dipper which we saw in the sky. Looking to the west, I saw a strange object in the sky. The object appeared to be a bright reddish glow with a curved trailing edge. The object appeared to be at a high altitude. There was no sound associated with this object. It appeared to be traveling in a straight and level flight with the duration of the sighting being very short. I did not hear or see any aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.
