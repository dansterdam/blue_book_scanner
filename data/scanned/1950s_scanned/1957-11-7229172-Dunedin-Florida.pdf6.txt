The text in the document is as follows:

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - NOV. 4 - (UP) - THE SOUTHWEST'S LEADING METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION, THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO'S DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS, LAST NIGHT REPORTED SEVEN UNUSUAL "FLYING SAUCERS" OVER ALBUQUERQUE, ROSWELL AND NEW MEXICO LAST NIGHT.

THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY PHYSICS DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL AT 9:00 P.M. MST. THEY REPORTED THE SEVEN OBJECTS WERE EITHER "MAN-MADE" OR COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE UNIVERSITY'S BALLOON-BORNE METEOROLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS RELEASED FOR UPPER AIR OBSERVATIONS.

DR. LINCOLN LAPAZ, HEAD OF THE UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTE OF METEORITICS, SAID THE OBJECTS OBSERVED LAST NIGHT WERE NOT A RESULT OF BALLOONS OR METEORS, AND THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR BEING "FLYING SAUCERS" COULD NOT BE ELIMINATED. HE SAID THEY WERE REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN SIGHTED OVER ALBUQUERQUE, ROSWELL AND OTHER CITIES IN NEW MEXICO.

LAPAZ SAID THE OBJECTS WERE MOVING AT A SPEED ESTIMATED AT FROM 600 TO 700 MILES PER HOUR, AND THAT SOME UNUSUAL MANEUVERING CHARACTERISTICS WERE NOTED, SUCH AS SUDDEN CHANGES IN DIRECTION AND SPEED.

HE SAID A TEAM FROM THE UNIVERSITY WOULD MAKE A FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT. SUCH A SPEED WOULD BE FAR IN EXCESS OF ANY KNOWN AIR VEHICLE, HE SAID.
