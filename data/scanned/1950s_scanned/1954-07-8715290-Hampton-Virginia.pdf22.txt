Honey,

I just saw the object and perhaps that was not down out of sight below the tree out of my sight. The 6:01 is perhaps only a slip up of my sight, and what seemed to be the tree out of my sight. The 8:01 was a round ball it seemed to go up into a tree and what seemed to be drop out of sight. When I came out to the porch to get a better view it was gone. The object was a reddish glow and seemed to only stay a few minutes then it disappered. When I came out into the drive it had apparently cleared the trees and I could not locate it again. The light seemed to change appearance and perhaps this is also what I thought I saw. But I do think this is a rather strange story that I think I can confirm as an observation.

I would appreciate it if you could get in touch with those fellows with the telescopes. They may have spotted it too and perhaps can tell me more about what I saw. Otherwise, I'm left really wondering just what I saw and I would be very interested to follow up on it. Let me know if you hear anything, okay? Let me know if you learn that anyone else may have seen it from the areas.

Sincerely,
