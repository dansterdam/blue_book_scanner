AFOSR-132
Transfer of USAF Aerial Phenomena Program

AFOSR-4 (V/Gen Doughty)
1. It is becoming clear a policy of producing the maximum of aerospace intelligence with a minimum expenditure of funds and utilization of manpower. AFOSR-4 December 1959, recommends the transfer of the Aerial Phenomena program (Project Blue Book) to the Air Technical Intelligence Center. It is pointed out at that time that after 12 years of experience ATIC has so far uncovered any objective evidence that UFOs are real or of extraterrestrial origin. It is my opinion that the data available is limited only to potential value to the United States Air Force was due to its scientific and/or technical interest. AFOSR after reviewing the program, is of the opinion that it only has potential scientific value to the United States Air Force was due to its scientific and/or technical interest. AFOSR after reviewing the program, is of the opinion that it only has potential scientific value and therefore of limited scientific value. It is my opinion that this data available is limited only because of the volume of material to continue meeting the USAF obligations to this program and also to initiate any other scientific program. It is undesirable that the Aerial Phenomena program be continued to the Air Technical Intelligence Center.

2. If you concur with these suggestions, it is recommended that the Director of the attached letter be established and forwarded to AFIN.
