THIS INCIDENT
TOOX PLACE
26 OCT 3-9

"See Fell from Sky" 
to Cal-Georgia Co., Carter
This report is based on inior-
nation secured from sources
which show that on Monday 
night, October 26, at about
9:45 pm, a strange object was
observed to fall from the sky
and strike the ground near
Toccoa, Ga., a few miles north
of the Georgia-South Carolina
line. The object was described
as being a ball of fire and
streaks were seen behind it
as it fell. The object struck
the ground with an explosive
impact about two miles north
of Toccoa, Ga. and the sound
of the explosion was heard for
many miles around.
Search parties were organized
immediately and went to the
scene. They found a crater
about 40 feet in diameter and
four feet deep, in which there
was a quantity of molten metal
and what appeared to be some
pieces of glass or other material.
The crater was cordoned off
and a guard placed around it 
to prevent anyone from aproaching
it or tampering with the evidence.
A quantity of the material from 
the crater was collected and taken
away for analysis. It is said that
the material was found to be
composed of an unknown substance.
