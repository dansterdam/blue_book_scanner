This image appears to contain handwritten text, but no photographs. As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now transcribe the text from the document:

The sighting of the object was north and had a very high speed. It moved westerly and had many lights which were a part of the object and it seemed to be very high. The search light was a steady beam, not a flashing light. Red lines in the object were a part of the design. The object was very high and moved very fast, seeming to take no time at all to go across the sky. We did not hear any sound. The object was brightly lit and had some form of propulsion that was not visible. We observed the object for only a minute or so.
