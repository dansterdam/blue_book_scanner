KEARNEY, NEBRASKA "SPACE SHIP" INCIDENT
5 November 1957

b. The space ship was described as approximately 100 feet long, 15 feet high, and 30 feet wide and rested on metal supports or "pads".

c. ________ stated that the interior was about forty feet long. Instruments mounted on aluminum stands lined the sides of the interior. He was unable to describe exactly any instrumentation except to say that a variety of circular and linear dials of various sizes were noticed. Both Roman numerals and ordinary numbers were noted on the dials. ________ stated that the interior of the object was lighted from an invisible source. No noise other than the crew talking was heard. It was possible to see through the sides, bottom and floor of the object, being perfectly transparent.

d. After 25 or 30 minutes they bid ________ goodbye and asked him to leave., The ship suddenly rose above the tree tops and sped off in a Southwesterly direction, without a sound being made. 

________ was taken to the scene of the sighting by Air Force Investigators. No marks where the struts of the object had rested were visible because the area had been walked over by newsmen. While he had stated that the body of the object was about three feet from the ground, many dry weeds and some scrub trees of four or five feet high were unbroken in the location where the object rested. He was unable to provide a reason for this.
