The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book document containing a detailed description of UFO sighting reports and observations.

Text from the document:

(5) a. Many reports of pilots trying to keep small, moving objects centered while they attempt to photograph them or file a which results with the illusion or appearance that the object was moving around the aircraft - instead of VIC versa. This invariably happens at close range when the object being observed has little altitude change show that pilot stating that the object (balloon?) was closing in on the aircraft, when actually the balloon was trailing still. This could possibly account for pilot's statement object circled around him. Correlation of this with his apparent, relatively indecent or unreliable observation - this honest mistake or belief on his part is understandable.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
(6) Check with AIRWAY (AMBER) NO. 8 - Running SE 2nd NW which carries considerable traffic. Although the pilots observed closely parallel this traffic airway heading - which would indicate the object was an aircraft - the characteristics, description, motion pattern rule out aircraft, but strongly point out balloons.

On the basis of data given, analysis of the pilots information and his personal reliability check, there is no compelling reason to conclude that the object observed was not probably a balloon.

Analyst's general comments:
Check: Same old story that pilots are "inreputable observers," although better than most, pilots still subject to all the opinions, mistakes, illusions all other observers are - - - to.
