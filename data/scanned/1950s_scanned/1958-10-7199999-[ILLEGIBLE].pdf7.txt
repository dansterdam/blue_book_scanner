37. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this?
(Circle One) No Yes

37.1 IF you answered NO, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?
I had seen similar objects, circular and elliptical in shape, that moved with high speed, in a silent and erratic manner on at least two previous occasions. The first time was about a year ago when I was driving home from work one night and the second time was while I was on patrol in my police car about six months ago.

38. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it?
It is my opinion that the object was some kind of advanced aircraft, probably of extraterrestrial or unknown origin. I have never seen anything like it before or since. I have no idea what might have caused it, but I believe it was some form of highly advanced, possibly electromagnetic, propulsion system.
