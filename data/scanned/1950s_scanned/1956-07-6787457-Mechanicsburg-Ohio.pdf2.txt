On Friday morning, (4 a.m.) I got up to get a drink of water. I couldn't get back to sleep, so I got up and dressed and went outside to look at the sky. It was a clear moonlit night. I saw a bright light in the southwest, moving rapidly in a straight line towards the east. It traveled very rapidly, and then it seemed to hover for a few seconds, then it suddenly went out of sight, as if it had moved beyond the horizon. The object appeared to be round or oval in shape, and it did not have any flashing lights or sound. It appeared to be a bright glowing light, with no visible means of propulsion. I observed it for about a minute. I have never seen anything like it before. The U.F.O. was still in sight, but it moved rapidly to the east, and I could no longer see it.
