On the afternoon of 5 July 1952 approximately 1545 hours, I observed a circular object traversing the sky at a high rate of speed. This object was estimated to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter and appeared to be metallic in structure. They moved with extreme maneuverability. They appeared to travel from the west to the east and then to the southeast. They were silent and no trail or exhaust was visible. One larger object appeared, and a pulsating glow was observed to emanate from it. I have heretofore been very careful as to any findings as to the causers or anything of that nature.

At one time I saw one in a tank and saw a metallic flash. On this particular date, they would abruptly disappear, except for a few seconds, and then reappear, traveling at extremely high speeds. They seemed to come from the west and to the east and southeast. The direction of the disappearance of these objects appeared to be from the west and to the east and southeast.

The report also describes sightings of objects in the sky, their movement patterns, and the inability to provide any definitive conclusions about the nature of the objects.
