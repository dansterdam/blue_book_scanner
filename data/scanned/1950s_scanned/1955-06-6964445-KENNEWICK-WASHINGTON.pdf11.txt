Re: Unidentified Flying Objects

Dear Sir:

On June 12, 1955, a letter was directed to your office reporting information, previously given to the Kennewick, Washington Police Department, relating to an incident of an unidentified flying object sighting. This information has continued to cause interest and questioning of the Air Force concerning his original reporting of this incident and has been described that it is not conclusive to the representative of the Air Force concerning his observations of this unidentified flying object sighting as related to us.
It is desired that this letter pass on to the appropriate representatives of the Air Force. S/Sgt. Richardson has been advised that his original information was turned over to your office and that you, in turn, have submitted contents will also be discussed with Major Russell Womack of your office on October 9, 1955 and his suggested that this letter be forwarded. 

Sincerely yours,

R. D. AUERBACH 
Special Agent in Charge
