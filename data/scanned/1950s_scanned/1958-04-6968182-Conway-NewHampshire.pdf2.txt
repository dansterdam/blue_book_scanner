PART II Comments and Analysis
8. Analysis:
1. Additional factors.
The two fighter aircraft sighted by Capt. Stubbs and his crew have not been
identified.
From the information obtained from Syracuse, N.Y. (13th) fighter-interceptor
flying at 25,000' at 5:30 P.M. with another aircraft 3 miles away not in sight,
no further information was available.
As a result of the investigation, the area of the sighting reported no unidentified objects
at that time. Hence, the Capt. and Crew have been cleared.
The analysis indicates the selection of the observing stations at 8:00, 9:00,
9:30, and 19:30 hrs. at Danbury, Atlanta, N.C., Newark, Ontario,
as the sighting reports indicate the positive identification of others.
From the evidence presented, the object sighted by Capt. Stubbs' crew and
the flight of one fighter aircraft could not be positively identified. It is possible that
the known radar contact was made - The fact that this object was
described as 3 times the size of the fighter aircraft does not account for the
distance estimate at 5 miles. The object was never seen again.
