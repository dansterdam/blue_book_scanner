MATADOR, TEXAS - 31 AUGUST 1951

On 31 August 1951 at approximately 2400 CST two Indians were driving in an automobile towards the town of Matador, Texas. The object was first sighted against the northern horizon. The object gave off a bright fluorescent glow. The object had a red or some type of pressure in the center. It moved through the air at a high rate of speed and forward. They judged the size to be about that of a T-33 fuselage. There was no sign of any exhaust.

As the two Indians were driving north from Matador, towards the driver's sight, the object was observed approximately 3 miles high and about 5-7 knots distant. They stopped and both Indians got out to observe the object. It was brighter than the stars required to be observed at that time of night. The object was seen to be of a rounded, circular shape. After a period of time, the object moved rapidly out of sight at an estimated speed of over 1,000 mph.

A background investigation shows that both women were of excellent character.

This incident is of interest because it was observed during the same period as the objects over Lubbock, Texas (see Appendix D).

Status of Investigation

There were also reports of crop dusting activity in the area at about the same time, which could have been misinterpreted as this activity.
