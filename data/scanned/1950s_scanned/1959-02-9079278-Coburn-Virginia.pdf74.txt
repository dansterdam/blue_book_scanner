The image contains three separate sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line to represent the horizon (skyline) and an object above it, with instructions to mark the position of the object on the curved line. The second and third sketches depict landscapes, with the second showing a road and buildings, and the third showing a person standing on a road with mountains in the background.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
