SURVEILLANCE OF 5 MARCH, 1959 CAMPION, NEW PROBABLY CEASED OR
BECAME UNRELIABLE AT 1901i:26Z SINCE PLOTS BECOME ERRATIC AT
THAT TIME. A REPORT ON 4 MARCH 1959 SAYS THAT IS SEEMED THAT
TARGET FELL STRAIGHT TO EARTH AT OR VERY NEAR THE POINT OF
DEPARTURE AND FAILING TO DEVELOP SUFFICIENT ENVELOPE IN-LAID OR
BROKE LOOSE FROM THE BOG AND IS FLOATED EARTH-WARD AT A MORE
LEISURELY RATE. ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT TARGET TERMINAL VELOCITY
AND IMPACT SEEMED TO CONFIRM THAT TARGET CASE RATHER THAN A
NORMAL TERMINAL VELOCITY FORCE RESULTING IN RUPTURE AND BURYING
IN SNOW. DARKNESS AND POOR WEATHER HAVE PREVENTED SEARCH OF THE
IMPACT POINT TO DATE. IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO NORAD THROUGH
OPERATIONAL CHANNELS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS OBJECT IS FOUND AT THE
IMPACT POINT, THAT WE WILL FORWARD THROUGH NORMAL
