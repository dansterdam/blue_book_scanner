The image provided does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book. The image shows various text elements, including a clock-like image in the upper right corner, a stamp that says "Act, and a number "0762" at the bottom.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will now attempt to produce the text found in the document:
