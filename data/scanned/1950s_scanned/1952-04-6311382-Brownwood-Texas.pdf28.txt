This object last part of it's a "light" just a brief moment it was thought to be a plane but it was not and it wasn't clear and in the small space that it was visible for a few seconds it did not have the characteristics of a plane it was not one.

Compared to a plane it moved much faster than any plane. It flashed and went out immediately - There didn't seem to be any jet or exhaust coming from it. It was simply a bright light that appeared and disappeared very rapidly. The time it was visible was estimatedly only about 2 seconds.
