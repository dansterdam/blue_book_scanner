"My second sighting" occurred about 5:20 p.m. this date (14C) as I was looking at the sky from the parking lot of the Finance Office. I saw a flying saucer about 23,000 feet altitude—approximately 9 miles away. It appeared to be over about the town of Ashland, Nebraska. The saucer was glowing with an iridescent white light and rotating at a very high rate of speed—the light was completely blotted out as it reached the extreme edge and then reappeared as it came around. It would do this three times before disappearing to the east-southeast.

"The saucer was about 100 feet in diameter and the rate of speed was tremendous.
I watched it for about 2 minutes before it disappeared. I notified the Operations Officer and Base Commander but they didn't see it. This is the second time I have observed this type of aircraft and the observations made by me and several others at the time confirmed my first sighting. The first sighting occurred at this base about a year ago."
