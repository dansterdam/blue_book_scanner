4 August 1952

At 10 AM on 1 August 1952, as I was entering the Security Service compound with a group of airmen returning to work after a weekend, I observed in the clear upper atmosphere a moving cylindrical object, traveling at a very high speed and altitude.

It appeared to be at a high altitude and was moving at a high rate of speed, silently. My attention was drawn to it almost immediately as it seemed to be traveling at a rate of speed much higher than any conventional aircraft I have ever seen.

It appeared to have some depth, possible one to six inches in diameter, and remained in sight for several minutes, during which time I observed no appreciable change in its size, shape, or speed. It seemed to be traveling in a horizontal position, neither climbing nor descending, maintaining a constant altitude.
