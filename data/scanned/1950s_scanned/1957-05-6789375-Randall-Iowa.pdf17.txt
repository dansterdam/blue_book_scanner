We had barely gotten into the highway again I saw an orange train of sparks come horizontally with Noiselessness reversed and disappeared about 2 to 3 seconds.
In retrospect to both appearances. One would expect some kind of maneuvering or what reflexes would produce, but none. It seems what is was was gone. In view of any activity we had were it was bright. It was shiny and only vaguely colored. (not white only but differing in the color I described as "polished pewter."
My wife described it as "powder bluish gray, the centered course it was resulting in almost directly into a stiff wind. After it turned and it moved almost at right angles to compensate. (The wind was S. to W. W.) It did not seem to actually wobble but appeared still exactly as it gone into course or direction.
We do not know what we did see right or wrong of course but we say with possible balloons, birds, incidental to our viewing cars, trucks, airplanes, reflections (non of the herina) we never saw it before.
We will appreciate your comments,
