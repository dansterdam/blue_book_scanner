The image shown is a scanned page that appears to contain a hand-drawn sketch, not a photograph. The sketch seems to depict a boomerang-shaped object with numerous circles or dots along its surface. This could be interpreted as a representation of lights or features on the object. There is no accompanying text visible in this image other than two redacted lines, one above and one below the drawing. The redacted lines are covered by black bars, preventing the reading of any text which may have been there. Since there's no visible text, I cannot provide an OCR output for this specific image.
