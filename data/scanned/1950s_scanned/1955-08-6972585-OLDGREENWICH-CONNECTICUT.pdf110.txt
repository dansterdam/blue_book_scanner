There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned page from an old document, likely a UFO report from Project Blue Book.

I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and output all the text found in the document:

I'VE HEARD PEOPLE NOTE TO NOTE HOW THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER REPORTS....INSTEAD OF A TWO-EYED OBJECT THAT WAS SILVERY IN APPEARANCE, IT SEEMS TO HAVE TURNED INTO A ONE-EYED LITTLE GREEN MAN. THIS IS JUST ONE MINOR INSTANCE OF HOW THE STORY MATERIAL WAS ALTERED.

ANYONE WHO TELLS THE TALE SEEMS TO ADD HIS OWN INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THESE OBJECTS LOOKED LIKE. FOR THIS REASON, I AM EXTREMELY PLEASED THAT WE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS CASE BEING INVESTIGATED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INITIAL ONSET OF SIGHTSEERS. THE WOMEN WERE RELAXED....AND WE HAD NO DISTURBANCE FOR TWO FULL HOURS. THAT MIGHT WE GOT THE MEN IN THE SAME CONDITION. UNDOUBTEDLY...BEFORE THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE HAPPENINGS WITH THEIR WIVES AND FRIENDS. I WAS HIGHLY IMPRESSED WITH THEIR SINCERITY, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, AS ONE COULD FACTOR WAS STILL IN EVIDENCE WHEN I ARRIVED THAT MORNING......THEY WERE STILL FRIGHTENED....AND WERE NOT OVER IT WHEN I LAST SAW THEM.
