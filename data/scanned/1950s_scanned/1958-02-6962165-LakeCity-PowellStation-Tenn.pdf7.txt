Largley through the use of MOONWATCH observations, the capabilities and operations of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory has been able to derive significant data. Even though precise results are treated in Chapter III and include the orbit determination of 1958 a and are the subject of another report, there are a few general aspects related to the perigee distance to be noted. The relative positions as they say of March 1958 have essentially the same expectancy gave that in all probability it must be concluded that in 1958, which probably have a significantly shorter lifetime; but still remains a detail to be. Various computational programs have been devised, and others are in progress, for the utilization of satellite observations for prediction purposes as contrasted to those use recently for geophysical interests. The programs at Pennsylvania State University have been programmed to determine geographical points have been programmed an ambition to determine the precise relation to the program which points out actual Beker-Munn camera settings can be cabled directly to the network installations. Implicit in the prediction program is the objective to disseminate the only specific predictions but general satellite information or an astronomical character to the public through the several mass media. This we have by concine statements to the press and by the preparation of charts illustrating visible passages of satellites over the United States.
