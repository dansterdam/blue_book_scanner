Over Airport Deal
By TOM TOWERS
Aviation Editor
Reports that the city-owned Hawthorne Airport might be leased to the Northrop Aircraft Company for use as a parking lot for the firm's trucks and storage of equipment came as something of a jolt to local residents and leading space on the front pages.
Consensus went that the transfer would be a mistake because we are a good general aviation airport and should remain that way. That normally would be spent on the plane enables us to prepare for traffic much more in the future.
AIR FORCE REPORT—AIR FORCE REPORT—AIR FORCE REPORT
Hawthorne airport. According to figures compiled by Air Force flyers, there were 60 aircraft on the field on May 1, 1945, and 90 aircraft on July 1, 1946. This would seem to indicate that the field is becoming more and more utilized as time goes on. A field that at one time appeared to be a rather small and insignificant one, apparently is developing into a fairly busy spot. The development of this has not been particularly rapid, but steady and sure. This field, located adjacent to the Hawthorne municipal boundaries, is owned by the City of Los Angeles. The City Attorney's office has declared that the city has no intention of leasing the field to any commercial enterprise. According to official sources, the events reported in the press did not occur and the field will continue to be operated for general aviation purposes. The city maintains that the field is self supporting from revenues derived from rentals and other such sources, and that there is no intention of disposing of the field in any manner at the present time.
