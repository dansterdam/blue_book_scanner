EVALUATION: UNCLASSIFIED
SUMMARY: On 3 July 1952, at about 2300 hours, an unidentified flying object was sighted by this station (F-47) from the 500 Radar Center at Syracuse, New York. The object was spotted as a single sighting of 20 to 30 miles of apparent size at 15 miles range. It maneuvered in an unidentified flying pattern for a duration of 5 minutes. The object was observed to move rapidly, gaining altitude very high and disappearing from radar coverage. Ground observers were unable to locate the object visually.
After 22 37Z sightings were intermittent, object seemed to be losing altitude and an approach control was vectored to track the object. However, the object disappeared from radar coverage.
The authenticity of this report is unknown as information was very brief and given by only one source.
This object was not picked up on the radar at this site at any time.
