IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE UNIDENTIFIED TARGET SIGHTED BY 2/LT. NAYLOR, FRIDAY, 26 JANUARY 1951, WAS NOT CAUSED BY ONE OF THIS ORGANIZATION'S TRACKED AIRCRAFT. IT APPEARS THAT IT WAS OBSERVED ONLY DURING THE INITIAL CONTACT AND THAT IT APPARENTLY INCREASED IN SPEED AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW IMMEDIATELY. FROM THE REPORT IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED WHETHER IT WAS AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL OBJECT OR SOME TYPE OF METEORLOGICAL PHENOMENON. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS RECOMMENDED TO DETERMINE IF POSSIBLE CAUSES CAN BE FOUND.
