INTO OCEAN. THE FLYING OBJECT WAS WITNESSED BY PILOTS AT GROTON, CONN. AND DROP PILOTS INTO THE OCEAN VIA PARACHUTE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL IN LOCATING IT.
EASTERN AIR LINES FLIGHT 460 WAS ALSO SEEN TO PASS THROUGH THE AREA AT TIME OF INCIDENT AND MAY HAVE SEEN THE OBJECT.

Although no sighting time is given in the original PROMPT, the descriptive location and details cited in both reports are nearly coincidental as to arouse the suspicion that the several incidents observed involved the same or related phenomena.
