The saucer was observed to be approximately 25 to 30 feet in diameter, spherical in shape, and was observed to be hovering over the water at a height of approximately 30 to 40 feet. The object was observed to be metallic in appearance, and was observed to be emitting a bright light from its underside. The object was observed to be moving at a very slow speed, approximately 5 to 10 miles per hour. The object was observed to be moving in a straight line, and was observed to be moving in a northeasterly direction. The object was observed to be in view for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, and was then observed to fade from view. The object was observed to be emitting a sound that was described as a "humming" sound. The object was observed by several witnesses, and the sighting was reported to the local authorities.
