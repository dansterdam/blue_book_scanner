There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a page from an old Project Blue Book UFO report document, containing a questionnaire with various questions about an unidentified object observation.

20. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object or objects made. Place an "A" at the beginning of the path, a "B" at the end of the path, and show any changes in direction during the course.

21. If POSSIBLE, try to guess or estimate what the real size of the object was in its longest dimension.

22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand (Circle One): a. Head of a pin, b. Pea, c. Dime, d. Nickel, e. Quarter, f. Half dollar, g. Silver dollar, h. Baseball, i. Grapefruit, j. Basketball, k. Other _________________

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22): a. Certain, b. Fairly certain, c. Not very sure, d. Uncertain

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view? Moving at a fast rate of speed if disappeared from sight.

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Of what type material would you make it? How large would it be, and what shape would it take? Give some appearance as to the object which you saw.

The object was constructed out of some shiny metal, such as aircraft metal. I would estimate it to be about the size of a medium bomber, that is, larger than fighter type aircraft. It's shape would be like that of a football in the air.
