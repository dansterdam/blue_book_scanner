was at 2000'. The professors calculated that if the object were at 2000', the speed would be greater than 600/mph. (Comment: About 1000 mph) Incidents that are possibly related to the Lubbock sightings were observed on 25 August 1951 and 31 August 1951.

On 25 August at 2158 MST, Mr. and Mrs. ----- of Albuquerque, New Mexico, sighted a "flying wing" type aircraft about 1 1/2 times the size of a B-36 over Albuquerque. The wing span was approximately 15 degrees and they noticed "soft glowing lights" on the trailing edge of the wing. There was no sound. It appeared to be going generally N to S. Mr. ----- is considered by O.S.I. to be completely reliable. The possibility of aircraft in area was checked and is negative.

At 1245 CST, Mrs. ----- and her daughter, Mrs. ------, were driving their automobile a few miles north of Matador, Texas. Mrs. ----- and then Mrs. ----- observed an object drifting slowly in an easterly direction. (Comment: This is the type of incident being looked into. The object was about 150' altitude and 200' in front of the automobile. It was pear-shaped and judged to be 150' high, 40' wide and 15' long. The ladies stopped the car and got out. The object was pear-shaped, aluminum or silver in color, with a window or port. It ascended rapidly, small and up, with a circular motion. There was no smoke or sound.

Mrs. Tilson has been checked by O.S.I. and appears to be reliable.

On 26 August 1951 another incident occurred which although not being in the Texas - New Mexico area may have a bearing on the incident. At 0835 PST (0626 CST) a ground radar type AN/CPS-1 and an AN/APS-4 picked up a fast moving target. The target was observed twice for a few seconds. The object was unclassified.
