The image appears to be a page from a document related to Project Blue Book, a United States Air Force program that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The page does not contain any photographs, but rather text describing an analysis of "simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances" made by an "aircraft research firm". The text discusses the "striking similarity" of these simulated photographs to "the two white blobs in this film", and states that based on the credibility of this analysis and the supporting evidence, the Air Force has "no compelling reason to alter its original conclusion".

THE CASE
5 or 15 Aug 1950

Simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances, made by an aircraft research firm in a recent independent and unsolicited analysis of the --- films, show striking similarity to the two white blobs in this film. 

Based on the degree of credibility accorded this early ATIC evaluation and the strong corroborative evidence supplied by the recent independent analysis, the Air Force has no compelling reason to alter its original conclusion.
