II. RELIABILITY: During the interview, the source was very inconsistent in his story. He could never stay within the general line of questioning but varied from subject to subject. He was somewhat familiar with when questions on UFO's and civilian aircraft but when he would switch to the bizarre and would refer to the type of flying vehicles illustrated in Science Fiction literature.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: At 00:05 EST, 9 May 1958, the source was atop a hill just south of Marietta, Ohio, when he sighted the object just north of Parkersburg, W.Va. traveling from east to west. He described the object as having four (4) lights in color, in front and one (1) bright white-light, not flashing, in the rear. Source said that the object appeared to be traveling at a speed of approximately three miles away, and the size of a small type airborne, traveling at a speed of 50 miles per hour. Source also stated that the object did not make any sound and that the weather was clear with no wind. He said that he had observed this object twice before, once on 24 April 1958 and again on 9 April 1958. The sightings were for approximately five (5) minutes. All sightings were done with the aid of binoculars and telescope. Source said that the only difference between the three sightings was the rear light from white to a reddish-white. In Source's opinion this object was an occupied or unoccupied vehicle from outer space and from a planet other than earth.
