The shared image does not contain a photograph, but rather a handwritten document. I will now act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and produce the text found in the document:

"Apparently saucer seen Francie, etc. Location - many miles north of Peoria, Ill. Toward Galesburg. Lasted many minutes. Sometimes stationary, sometimes slowly moving. Round, shiny object, somewhat larger than a street car. No trail, no vapor trail. No sound audible.

Possibly a member of the Francie family (name redacted) 6-27-52

P.S. Frankfort child, Yvonne 17, saw a steady light for a long time."
