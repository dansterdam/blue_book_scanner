NEW SPUTNIK SIGHTS OVER ELKHART AND GAR

Indiana residents reported they saw what appeared to be Sputnik as it hurried across the sky. According to newspaper and radio reports, many residents reported receiving calls from neighbors describing the object as a point of light moving in the north.

Almost all the callers said they saw it at 6:44 a.m. today as they were going home from their night shift, according to Alex Jarrell, Michigan City. He reported he saw the object traverse the sky in a southwestern direction.

The director of Radio Station WKAM said he spotted it at 6:47 a.m. while going home from his night shift. He described it as slightly less bright than a first magnitude star.

In brilliance, he said, it appeared to be about the same as the dog star, Sirius. Parts of Gary reported seeing the object in the early morning.
