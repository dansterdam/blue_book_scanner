Case February 14, 1952

Card to Olapenga there. And you, if you are considering this a report, please disregard it. This is my delayed answer to the unusual occurrences near Nouasseur AFB, Morocco, Because it is inconsistent with "the law of physics and mechanics".

The details of the sighting. I have not had a chance to plot them on a diagram or analyze them. What confuses me is the fact is your statement that the witness horizon was considerably lower than normal. This would indicate that the object showed and distance covered in 13 minutes was 12 miles or approximately 58 miles an hour. Your stating the sighting was 43 minutes after sunset. The sky should have still had good visibility which contradicts the brightness of the object. The theoretical and of twilight is 6.11.

You have raised the question of the terrestrial explanations. It is agreed with your data with information. There are still plenty of terrestrial explanations that could be given to these occurrences. There are still plenty of terrestrial explanations that could be given to these occurrences. In my opinion, it is much further from the study these basic naturalist extraordinarily explanation. In my opinion, it is much further from the study these basic naturalist extraordinarily explanation. You refer to detection by other means. I am always a bit a few cases where reports are being heard of the Investigate. But they only came a shortly such as the Florida scout master, unrelated worse than the reported saucer.

With reference to your final question, there is nothing to support the claim to date from the Hydm 1949 probe to have been in the earth's orbit. It was certainly not a Harvard observation. 

I enclose herewith my tentative schedule on the form C-39 for us to consider and to discuss the subject at our next meeting. This would be a continuation.

Again, I want to thank you for your frank and belief to any questions. As I want to both know how these we stood.

Cordially yours,
