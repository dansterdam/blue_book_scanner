Para 15a: 2/Lt Julian H. Celenter AO1956250, Wing Air Targets Officer, 402

As a State Trooper, Officer related that he had observed an unconventional object in the sky. He said it appeared to be changing its direction and speed. He took several pictures of the object with his Polaroid Land Camera. All the pictures show the object as a bright light. According to the report, the officer stated that the object "would turn on this extremely bright light while he was looking through the view finder. As I would take a picture, the light would go out. It would then come back on again as I was waiting to take another picture." The object apparently "disappeared". Trooper described the object as making no sound and estimated its speed to be much greater than a conventional aircraft. When the object was at its closest, there was a "strange humming or electrical sound" which the Trooper could hear, and which seemed to come from the object. There was a bright glow around the object. The Trooper is a competent photographer and the negatives of these photos show nothing but the single "light" or photo number three. Otherwise, the object picture shows only a bright light, the characteristics of which seem to indicate some unconventional aerial object.

The details recorded in this report appear to indicate the presence of an unconventional aerial phenomenon. No conclusive evidence is available as to the true nature of the object observed. The circumstances and the physical evidence, however, suggest the possibility of an unknown aerial vehicle.
