AFOIN-BE
COMMENT NO: AFOIN-BE/Capt Gregory/amc/6-9216
1. Subject report has been reviewed. There appears to be three unrelated incidents involved.
2. Suggestions upon which to base a reply:
a. Air Force to deny the sighting as a erroneous report or astronomical objects or balloons or telescope misidentifications.
b. Without photographs and accurate data, elevations, bearings, etc., complete identification based on the observer's own description is difficult, if not impossible. Amateur and professional astronomers and sky observers almost invariably provide this data without request. Mr. [REDACTED] only provides general descriptions.
c. Although the object was a bolide - a number were reported during that period.
