II. REPORT OF INTERVIEWS

A. Tower Operator - Patterson AFB - 25 June 1954.
1. At 0600 hours, the unidentified airman visited the Patterson Tower and met with Sgt. Shoemaker, who was on duty at the time of the incident. Sgt. Shoemaker stated that Lt. Roe contacted the tower at 2120 hours and requested the tower personnel to search for the object he was chasing towards Columbus. Lt. Roe also stated that the object seemed to be approximately five (5) miles in front of his aircraft.
Sgt. Shoemaker and another airman both grabbed binoculars and observed Lt. Roe's aircraft. It did not see any light. Sgt. Shoemaker then asked the pilot of C-47 aircraft, serial number 265 (which had just taken off) to observe Lt. Roe's object. Pilot replied he could not see any light of that sort. When Lt. Roe last reported his position to the tower, he was 15 miles SE of Columbus. Just after Lt. Roe's report, an F-86D aircraft reported it was 15 miles NW of Columbus and requested landing instructions.
