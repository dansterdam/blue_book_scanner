The image contains no photograph. It appears to be a typed document with text describing "Three Unidentified Flying Objects Land in France" by C.I.E. and the Bureau of C.V.N.I. (U.F.O.).

The text describes how three unidentified flying objects were observed from the ground at Vins-Sur-Caramy (Var), Palaida (Pyr-Or) and Beaucourt-Sur-Ancre (Somme) in France, with eleven eye witnesses verifying the events. It states that the physical phenomena was carried by C.I.E. and the Bureau of C.V.N.I. (U.F.O.). 

The text further discusses the announcement of the continuation of the proposal that was announced in March 1957, and how the events were investigated and confirmed by the Committee of Investigation of C.I.E. Curanoe in the last two meetings.
