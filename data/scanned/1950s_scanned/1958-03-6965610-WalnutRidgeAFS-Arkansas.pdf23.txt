JUPITER MAKES APPEARANCE
March, the month that sees the official end of winter with the coming of the vernal equinox on the 20th, is also a good time for observing the planets.

BY JAMES STOKLEY

WITH THE COMING of March the planets Jupiter and Saturn are the most prominent in the evening sky, as shown by the charts. These show how the sky looks about an hour after sunset on the dates indicated.

Jupiter is low in the southwest at the beginning of the month and two hours earlier at the end.

Jupiter is low in the east in the constellation of Virgo, the virgin, to the left of the two stars known as the "Pointers." This is a good time to observe the planet, as it is then highest in the sky during the evening hours. Its light also shines with a brilliant gleam.

But Jupiter is not the only planet to be seen in March. Saturn, which is in the east at the beginning of the night, is also a conspicuous object. For several evenings around the 20th, as if it were trying to compete with Jupiter, Saturn becomes noticeably brighter, until it appears almost as brilliant as its fellow.

When it is high in the south, which it now is, with its rings tipped to the right at a rather low angle, Saturn makes a beautiful telescopic object. Through a good amateur telescope, the rings and the ball of the planet can be seen.

Following the Zodiac Path
To the left of the Centaur, the Constellation Cancer, the Crab, has other conspicuous objects which are interesting to observe. For example, the path through which the sun, moon and planets move, known as the zodiac, can be traced through this constellation.

One can see it passing from west to east, and the bright star cluster in the crab, known as Praesepe or the Beehive, is near the middle of this path. This is a conspicuous star cluster, easily seen with the unaided eye on a clear night.

Besides these, there are other interesting things to note about Cancer. On the following pages are the descriptions in order from brightest to faintest, of the various stars and star clusters in this region of the sky, which are shown on the two sky maps.
