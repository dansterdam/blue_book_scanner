Transcribed text from the document:

The object observed was apparently a large plane or airplane descending at a very steep angle. This was very puzzling, since there was no air base or airfield nearby, and a noise like a jet aircraft was heard. There was only a brief sighting, lasting only a few seconds. When the object passed behind some trees, it was lost from view and no further observations were made.

MATT, 17, JR.
Could not be identified. Could only be regarded as a more or less unusual check, and a rather unsatisfactory explanation of the incident, and a note comes out of the incident saying "This is my personal opinion - here it is."

Why would any of your reports be highly prized as they were not well to trying to secure them as mere confirmation, things all the time. Here is an extra ordinary event worth a enquiry.

Unless we greatly tighten up our system, or get might not have some out of it and talked away, very simple the situation.
