"Mystery of Paris Sky: Flying Cognac Bottle?"
By Frank Kelley

PARIS, Feb. 6 (AP) - Several experts are at work trying to find out what was seen in the sky near or at Orly Airport last Saturday that four French fighter plane pilots said they sighted and chased for four hours.
The pilots reported they saw a mysterious object that climbed to an altitude of more than 10,000 feet and at times put on bursts of speed up to 2,000 miles an hour.
Some say it may have been another one or several of these American meteorological balloons that have been found in various parts of Europe.
But the pilots, Michel Chevaye, Henri Baretta, Georges Prioux and Rene Zuber, said the object they chased had the shape of a flattened sphere or a "cognac bottle" that changed color from orange to white.
They said they fired on it and it disappeared. The French Air Ministry has the pilots' report and is investigating.
The Director of the National Aeronautics and Meteorological Research Center in Paris said the object is a mystery the center cannot explain. He said the pilots' description did not fit any known aerial device.
"It cannot be explained by any natural phenomenon," he said. "We are at a loss to know what it was."
