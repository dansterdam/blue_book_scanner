STATEMENT
Sighting of an object by USAF pilot near Greenville, Mississippi.

The object was similar to a large star, but seemed to be rotating and emitting green and red flashes, and moving slowly north and descending on the horizon. The object's speed could not be determined, as the method of propulsion could not be determined. 

The observation was made at 22:35 hours on 27 August 1953. The object was obscured by clouds and it was lost from sight at 22:38 hours. The object reappeared very slowly and up and down. The object was sighted visually from the surface, however the speed and altitude were undetermined.

The observation was taken from my home window at the distance between the object and myself could not be determined. See included memory sketch for more details. (Inclosure #2)

I have 12 years Air Force service and hold a private flying certificate. I have visibility of 20/20 and experience of night flying operations. I was flying a C-47 type aircraft over this area but at the time of sighting was on the ground and not airborne. My experience and qualifications are satisfactory for this type of observation.

The weather was high scattered clouds, wide visibility conditions for the sighting. There was no physical evidence density of the sighting. There was no physical evidence density of the sighting or trace left on the ground.
