II. Report of Interviews. (Continued)
C. Operations Officer - NG - Dayton Municipal Airport - 25 June 1954.
1. At approximately 1900 hours, 25 June 1954, the undersigned airman, accompanied by Dr. Hynek (ATIC Astro-Physicist consultant on UFOS) visited the 121st Fighter-Bomber Squadron of the Ohio National Guard based at the Dayton Municipal Airport. We were introduced to Captain Wagenhals, Operations Officer of that unit. (Note: Captain Wagenhals was the first and only Air Force official to notify the Aerial Phenomena Section of the UFO.) Captain Wagenhals was first to reach Lt. Roe when he landed. He stated to Lt. Roe "I must be going off my rocker because I saw something really strange up there." Lt. Roe proceeded to tell Captain Wagenhals the story of the sightings. The interview with the Captain practically verified everything the airman told the undersigned airman. Captain Wagenhals stated Lt. Roe would have to be awfully close to a jet aircraft to see its exhaust unless the jet was taking its afterburner. The jet theory was ruled out however by all three (3) persons at the interview when speed was taken into consideration. No jet could fly that slow (referring to Lt. Roe's stalking at approximately 100 - 100 MPH) and the object not passing him without apparent aerodynamic complications arising. Captain Wagenhals stated that the weather over the Dayton area was very clear and visibility unlimited.
