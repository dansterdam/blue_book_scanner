The image does not contain a photograph, but rather a diagram and instructions. The diagram shows a sketch of a circular object in the sky, with the observer's position marked at the bottom, and instructions for drawing the motion and shape of the object.

The text in the document reads:

23. In the following sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at the position where you last saw it.

24. Draw a picture that will show the motion that the object made. Place an "A" at the beginning of its path and a "B" at the end of its path.

25. Draw a picture that will show the shape of the object. Label and include in your sketch any details of the object that you saw and place an arrow beside the drawing to show the direction the object was moving.
