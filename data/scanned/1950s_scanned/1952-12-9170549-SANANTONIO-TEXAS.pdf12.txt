There does not appear to be any photograph present in this image. The image seems to contain a document or report from Project Blue Book, which was a United States Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The text in the document is as follows:

San Antonio, Texas 21 December 1952

I. Description of Incident
One round, unidentified object of undetermined size, that emitted an intense green light was observed and investigated by a civilian man while driving in his car. On the object's approach, it silently passed overhead and quickly disappeared in the distance.

II. Discussion of Incident
This can be written off with quite a bit of assurance as simply a common occurrence - a meteor or similar atmospheric phenomenon seen for a short time in sight and fad out just before disappearing.

III. Conclusion
Probably meteor.
