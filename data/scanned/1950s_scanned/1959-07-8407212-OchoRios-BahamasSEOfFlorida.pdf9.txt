The handwritten text on the form states:
"The formation of the object was reasonably measured in that at the first time it was seen near the horizon and then slowly moved toward the observer as it did turn east and then northwest. It moved very fast and disappeared after about 15 minutes. It was a very high speed object and made no sound that could be heard."
