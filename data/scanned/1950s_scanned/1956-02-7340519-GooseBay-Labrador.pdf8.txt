The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be an old document from Project Blue Book, which was a U.S. Air Force program to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text in the document is as follows:

HEADQUARTERS

The information in this report is too incomplete for an evaluation to be made. It is not logical for a genuine target to "fade" and disappear when the fighter gets close to it, as the normal situation is for the target to get stronger the closer the fighter gets to it.
