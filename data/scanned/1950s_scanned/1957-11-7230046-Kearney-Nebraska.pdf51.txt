THE KEARNEY INCIDENT

\my boss vouched for my sanity and stability, and my other employer from Los Angeles sent a letter in the form of an affidavit to the 
hospital vouching for my business judgment and honesty. They stated :
had bought thousands of dollars of 
grain for them and they never had 
any occasion to doubt my ability or 
character.

I was released from the hospital 
that day.

On the whole, my stay at the hos- 
pital was quite pleasant. I had a 
private room, and I got along swell 
with the doctors and nurses. Except 
for one psychiatrist.

“I’m going to ask you a series of 
questions,” he said, “and I want you 
to answer what the first thing that 
comes to your mind, whether it an- 
swers the question or not."  
The first question was, “Who was 
smarter, George Washington or 
Abraham Lincoln” 
“l don't know,” I replied “I wasn't 
even born then." 
The next question: “If you weren't 
a human being, what would you 
rather be?”
“I’d rather be a psychiatrist!”
With that he slammed his book 
shut.

I asked if that was all the ques- 
tions. 
“Yes,” he said. “In court our rec- 
ord doesn’t stand up anyway.” 

Back in Kearney, I said to my 
boss, “Well, do I still have a job?”
"You certainly do,'' he said. "I 
made a little investigation here in 
Kearney myself for three days before 
I came to the hospital and all the 
people I talked to were behind you."

So he suggested we put an ad in 
the local paper stating I was back 
in Kearney buying grain again. The 
ad ran as follows:

               **ATTENTION** 
            **MILO AND CORN GROWERS**
That crazy grain buyer from Cali
-
-
-
fornia is still around and would 
like to bid on your grain. Will pick 
it up at your farm in twenty long 
trucks 
Call me at the Fort Kearney Hotel. 
Reinhold O. Schmidt, Brawley, 
California.”

The paper came out that after- 
noon, and by evening I had a stream 
of phone calls from farmers offer 
Ing to sell their grain to me. If I 
could have managed the transporta- 
tion of it I could have bought thou 
sands of tons of grain that night.
I bought grain around Kearney for
three months after that and, on 
February 5, I was looking over a 
field about twenty miles west of 
Kearney near Elm Creek.

I was driving along a country road 
about fifty miles per hour when 
suddenly my car stopped with a 
braking effect. (I was driving the 
same car as before - a 1955 Buick 
Super). The same ship hovered down 
beside me inside the fence of a 
meadow! I thought to myself, “Well,
here it goes again!”

I got out of the car and was walk-
ing toward the fence when another 
car drove by with a man and a wom-
man and a little child in it. I waved 
at them to stop, hoping to have 
some witnesses, but they hurried by 
even though they looked right at me.

I don't know whether they saw the 
ship or not. By the time I climbed 
the fence, the door of the ship slid 
open and the same man who talked 
to me on the first contact asked
me if I would do them a favor. 

I told them I would be glad to if 
I was at all possible. Then they in-
vited me into the ship and asked me 
if I would care to take a little ride-
as it would cause too much commot-
tion for them to remain beside the
road

The ship rose straight up into the 
air, and when approximately 150 to 
200 feet up, the man turned to me
