There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a scanned document from Project Blue Book, an official U.S. Air Force program to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

The text from the document is as follows:

themselves out in the upper atmosphere, but persist into the lower levels crashing into the earth's surface. A fireball that explodes before reaching the earth's surface is usually referred to as a "bolide". An encounter with a fireball during darkness can be a frightening experience, as these bodies can suddenly illuminate the surroundings with a dazzling, daylight intensity.

Conclude with (separate paragraph): It has been repeatedly proved that attempting to observe objects later found to be stars, planets or other apparently fixed celestial bodies, through handheld binoculars or glasses will often give an illusion of unusual maneuvers, trajectories and speeds. This is particularly true when such bodies are observed under adverse sky or weather conditions.

Page 5 RADAR SIGHTINGS: Comment: The summary section (page 5) and the detailed Section III (page 21) gives the impression that unidentified objects observed on radarscopes are primarily the result of temperature inversions and other meteorological causes. The following, in substance, should be integrated, as desired, into both sections:

1. "Spurious" blips or returns may also be caused by
a. Mutual interference between radar units
b. Jamming
c. Unknown malfunctioning of equipment
d. Radar target simulators

2. Even experienced radar operators can err in interpreting radar returns. This is particularly true when operating personnel from radar units located in stable-weather areas are assigned to radar units located in unstable-weather areas.
