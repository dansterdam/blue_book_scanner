AIR ATTACHE, AUSTRALIA 
IR-20N-33 6-15-52 UNCLASSIFIED

15 minutes were yellow and flickering. I watched the object for approximately 25 seconds. It was a small light, irregularly shaped behind a large thunder-head cloud. The sky was generally clear. Just as I was watching, I thought the object was a jet aircraft approximately over 10,000 feet. It seemed to be moving rapidly for that height. However, at one stage, I noticed that it stopped moving for approximately 25 seconds. It then started to move again and disappeared behind the cloud. 

This was the second sighting I had made. The first was on 13th May when I had noticed an object standing on the horizon for a few seconds. I looked at it again, but it had disappeared. 

Sightings said to have been made on 3rd May for a duration of approximately 300 to 400 feet. It finally disappeared behind a cloud.

On 1st May, a bright object was seen travelling at a high rate of speed from south to north over the northeast corner of Australia. It was observed for approximately 15 to 20 seconds. Colour: I estimate it would be about 200 yards long and could be the size of a small airliner. It then disappeared from view behind the cloud cover. It was sighted by a number of people.
