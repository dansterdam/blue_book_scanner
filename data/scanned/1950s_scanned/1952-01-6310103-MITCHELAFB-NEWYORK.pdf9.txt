CONFIDENTIAL

TRIP REPORT

I. General

The first contact at Mitchel AFB was with Lt Col Clark, Director of
Intelligence for ConAC and his assistant, Major Walff. They reviewed what
they knew about the sighting, giving no new info, and called Major Burisher,
Operations Officer from Mitchel AFB who had written up the initial Form 112.
Major Burisher then reviewed the incident. Everyone at both ConAC hq and Mitchel
were extremely cooperative.

II. Mitchel Weather Station

These people could give no further info other than the winds aloft in more
detail. The balloon had been tracked by radar. It was hoped that the radar
crew had picked up the MBM circling the balloon but they said it was common
place to pick up a/c along with the balloon and wouldn’t have remembered the
specific incident. It will be noted that they meant that they picked up a/c
at the same azimuth, not necessarily near the balloon. Also they are so intent
on the balloon return that they probably wouldn’t have noticed an a/c return
if it had appeared close.

A balloon, like the one released on 21 January 1952 at 9055 E, was
inspected. It is about six ft. in diameter on the ground and increases in
size as it ascends. They try to adjust the hydrogen to get a rise of 300 ft
(95 m.) per minute. The balloon carried an aluminum foil radar reflector,
18 in. on a side, suspended 6 in. below the balloon. The color of the balloon
was a grayish, the color of natural rubber, with talcum powder sprinkled on
it. This talcum powder makes streaks in the balloon, due to the way it is
coated, the streaks being similar to panels in a parachute canopy.
