There is no photograph present in this image. The image appears to be a handwritten document with text that seems to be part of a UFO report or investigation. I will now proceed to act as an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system and extract all the text found in the document:

Favorable winds only and at times a mere
momenr than last for a was leaving it
was not any to hear it was going very
fast and steady and appeared to be at great
altitude it was in sight but a few seconds
and I was so startled I did not think to
get the time tho I glanced at my watch
at the time. There was no engine noise
what ever or jet stream visible it just appeared to 
be a solid object of some kind gliding at
great speed and at great altitude it did not
appear to be an aircraft of any kind that I 
have ever seen.
