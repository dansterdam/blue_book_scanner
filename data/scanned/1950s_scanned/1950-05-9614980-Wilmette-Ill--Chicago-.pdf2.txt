"On 31 May 1950, Dr. (deleted) and his wife observed an unidentified aircraft in the sky over Lake Michigan just south of Wilmette, Illinois. As they were seated in their parked car on the shore of Lake Michigan just south of Wilmette, when Mrs. (deleted) called the doctor's attention to a strange object in the sky over the lake. The object was traveling south at a tremendous rate of speed and at first Dr. (deleted) thought it was a streak of lightning while driving it by. The object was visible for about 10 seconds while passing by, and appeared to be some type of aircraft."

The object was elliptical in shape, approximately 50 to 100 diameters and appeared to be traveling on a set course 5 to 8 miles from shore. The object was at a high altitude and several hundred feet above the surface of the lake at that time. Altitude was estimated at 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon. The object was described as having a slight pinkish hue. The flight of the UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT was also witnessed by the occupants of a car bearing a 1950 Illinois license plate number (deleted).
