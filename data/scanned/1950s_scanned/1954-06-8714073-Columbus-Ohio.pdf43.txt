There is no photograph present in this image. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document containing a transcript of a conversation.

The text of the document is as follows:

2. Capt. Hardin, chief, Aerial Phenomena Section, was not present in the office when the above report was received by the undersigned airman. Immediately upon return of Capt. Hardin, he was informed of the telephone conversation. It was decided by Capt. Hardin (after short analysis of the facts available) and the undersigned airman, that the report was a reflection of some type and we would investigate the matter more thoroughly on Monday, 26 June 1954. (Capt. Hardin then departed on two (2) days leave.)

3. At approximately 10:45 hours, the plot began to thicken. Sgt Drepperd received another telephone call from "Doc" Fisher of the Dayton Daily Newspaper. Following is the exact conversation as I, (Sgt. Drepperd), remember it:

Mr. Fisher, "Did you fellows receive a UFOB report - is it true."

Sgt. Drepperd, "Yes, I received a verbal report earlier this morning."

Mr. Fisher, "What did it look like?"

Sgt. Drepperd, "I am sorry, but I am not authorized to make any statements or press releases."

Mr. Fisher, "I see." "This fellow was in the OSI, wasn't he?"  

Sgt Drepperd, "I am awfully sorry, but I can't release any information. The only agency that releases official Air Force statements is USAF PIO. I suggest you contact Hq USAF for further information."

Mr. Fisher, "Washington, can you tell Washington know of this report?"

Sgt. Drepperd, "Sorry, can't tell you. Let me call you back after I check with my superiors."

Mr. Fisher, "O.K. I've still got 25 minutes to press time. Goodbye."
