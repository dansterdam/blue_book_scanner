Saucer Visiting Balloon? 
2 Field Pilots Not Sure

Airmen Sight Object While On Mission 
In New Mexico: AWD Officials Silent

Two Wright Field officers added another chapter to the 
"Flying Saucer" mystery" the other night.

Capt. J. S. Cracker of the All-Weather Flying Division, and 
Capt. John T. Mazener of the Aerodynamical Laboratory, were 
flying in a C-47 about 50 miles southeast of Holloman Air Force 
Base, New Mexico, when they spotted an unidentified object in the 
sky.

They said they were flying at a C-47 at about 12,000 feet 
when Albuquerque, N.M., "ground control" notified them of a large 
balloon reported in that area. As they approached the area, they 
said, they saw a strange object which did not seem to be a balloon.

"It was traveling much faster than a balloon, and it was much 
smaller than a balloon," they said. "It was round and it seemed to 
be emitting a bright light.

"We tried to get closer to it to identify it, but it streaked off 
and we lost it. We don't know what it was. In a way, it looked like 
a star, but it wasn't acting like a star. It wasn't doing anything, just 
hovering."

Capt. Cocker said the object was at a much higher altitude than 
the balloon which was reported in that area. He said the object 
seemed to be traveling at a very high speed.

Officials at the All-Weather Flying Division and the 
Aerodynamical Laboratory at Wright Field declined to comment on 
the sighting.
