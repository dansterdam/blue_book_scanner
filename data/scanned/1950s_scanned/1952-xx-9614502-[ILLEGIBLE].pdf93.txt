REPORT NO: 229

1. DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTINGS:

Multiple sightings of unidentified flying objects were observed on 28 and 29 June 1952. The objects gave the appearance of being normal aircraft due to the altitude and speeds involved but the significant clues constituting the sightings were the irregular patterns of flight, maneuvers of an erratic nature, and periods of static hovering aloft. There was no trail or vapor trail as the objects executed the observed maneuvers. There was the elimination of one sighting period when apparently the objects disappeared and reappeared at another point. There was a total of 12 sightings on 28 June and 7 sightings on 29 June 1952.
