No Case (Information Only)
1 December 1959
Oakland-Fremont area, Calif.

At about 3:15 a.m. on December 1, 1959, a bright light was seen to pass over the Oakland-Fremont area of California. The light was first seen by two watchers at the Oakland Airport control tower. They reported that the object appeared to be traveling at a very high speed and that it suddenly exploded into a white light, which then extinguished. The witnesses could not determine what the object was or where it came from. They described it as a fantastic speed and exploded into a white light which then went out. The true nature of the incident has not been clearly established.
