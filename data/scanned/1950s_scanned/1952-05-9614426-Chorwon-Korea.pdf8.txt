Gentlemen:

For some time, I have personally been deeply interested in the problem of unidentified flying objects. As you know, a series of these objects were reported by a group of us interested in this problem on November 8. Our sighting and observations were of the nature of the extra-terrestrial research organization. Since that time, they have continued to grow in frequency and scope.

As a result of the limited research we have been able to undertake, we have been able to accumulate some definite reports of unidentified objects that are or may be flying scour category and not in operation Bluebook files. In addition, we have received reports from our investigators covering 70 such objects, most of which do not seem to have been covered prior to the present time.

These objects, as you are presently investigating, comprise a sightings date from September 16, 1952.

To give an example of the type of reports we regard as reliable and which would like to give the following, which may or may not be in Air Force files:

At 2:25 p.m. 'Eastern daylight time' on May 18, 1952 in Lakewood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, a woman reported that the sky was a beautiful blue without a cloud in sight. Upon looking out her picture window, she saw a white, round, solid-appearing object in our airspace. The object hovered motionless for several minutes, then shot straight up at a tremendous speed and disappeared. The entire observation lasted about 45 seconds.
