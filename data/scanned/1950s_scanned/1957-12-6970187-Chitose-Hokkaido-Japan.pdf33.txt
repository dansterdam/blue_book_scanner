REMARKS:
RCAF (RCAF) F-45 assumed control of Subway Red at 09222 and immediately vectored it toward the object. F-45 was painting the object by the height-range finder and visually. Red reportedly maneuvered the object. At 09552 the report reported a visual on a bright object off the coast which, but visual tracking was lost. Since the object and Subway Red was told to cancel the mission, it can be ascertained the object went away between 2400, 110 miles from the site. Subway Red was vectored until approximately 2350' and obtained another visual. However, the visual was broken off and it was reported they were observing a reciprocal.
