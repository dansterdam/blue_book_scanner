SOURCE:

Address: Portage, Maine, (HCGB 3146).

Age: 44

Occupation: Owner and operator of chain of Sporting Camps on lakes in the interior of Northern Maine.

Education: College.

Qualifications: Mr. was a pilot under volunteer status during World War II, with the Civil Air Patrol and the Corps of Army Engineers.

II. RELIABILITY: In view of the facts as stated by persons knowing Mr. for several years past, there can be little doubt as to his integrity and judgement.

III. SOURCE'S DESCRIPTION OF SIGHTING: While progressing southward on Xamshaua Lake (HCGB 0022) at a speed of 4 MET, Mr. attention was called to an object streaking across the sky from west to East, by another member of the party in his boat. The time was estimated to be 192102 Jul 56. By the time Mr. had located the object, he had only 2 or 3 seconds in which to follow it.

The object was seen while the sun was high in the sky, there was no wind, and no clouds were present in the sky. The temperature also was normal for the area, as seen by Mr. an It is estimated the brightness to be about the same as that of an automobile headlight several blocks away, and also resembling a headlight. It was about the size of a baseball held at arms length and resembling a bright star, around the edges.

Mr. declared that it would be impossible for him to assert positively as to the color, as It vardied in color from a faded red to an orage, and then to yellow; leaving behind a wavy trail similar to that of a jet, only dissapating much sooner, and also a lighter color, almost white. He further stated that he could not judge as to the transparency or solidity of the object, therefore he would have np way of knowing what types of materials would be needed if another object like it was to be constructed, and again, if it could be constructed. he would have no idea of the exact shape.

Mr. further stated that after watching this object cross the sky and disappear behind a ridge of hills not too far from the lake, he, as well as the the rest of the party heard and felt, a severe explosion, much like that which would come if a large cache of dinamite might blow up.

When asked if he had ever seen anything which resembled this object, Mr. very quickly answerd that he had not, and he felt that he would recall it if he ever had. He declared that his first thought was of a disabled jet, but after seeing and thinking about the speed, he felt certain that was not likely. This object was travelling at about three times the speed of any jet he had ever seen.
