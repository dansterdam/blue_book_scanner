(Unol) Unidentified Aerial Object Sighting

TO ATTCH-4
ATT:Lt P. Robinson

DATE 3 AUG 53

1. Enclosed is a sighting of an unidentified aerial object made by several experienced observers on 29 March 1953 at 2315 CST over San Antonio, Texas.

2. ATTCH-2 requests that you consider the following in determining the feasibility of its being caused by certain astronomical phenomena such as an unusual meteor shower. This description of the object seems to bear little or no resemblance with one notable exception: some of the objects apparently traveled in a circular course. A radar station made the contact, thus establishing the possibility of accurate observation.

3. We would appreciate your comments on the subject sighting.

Vessel Comment by Dr. Robertson to Lt. Olsson:
"Have studied the mmm incident; possible that a hoax or a high range of activity. A material object may have been reported, but the sighting that the activity got. Suggest to suggest that day or any imminent motion occurred to human nature when a simple and obvious explanation was obtained."
