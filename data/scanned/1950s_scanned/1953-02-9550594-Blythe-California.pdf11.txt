CAPTAIN DAVID WEBB WHO WAS PILOT SIGHTED AN OBJECT THROUGH THE NAVIGATOR'S WINDOW AT 33,000 FEET. HE CALLED MY ATTENTION TO IT AND I LOOKED OUT THE NAVIGATOR'S WINDOW AND SAW A WHITE OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE ROUND IN SHAPE. AS TO SIZE AND HOW HIGH THE OBJECT WAS, I COULD NOT SAY, BUT IT APPEARED TO BE ABOVE THE SIZE OF AN AIRCRAFT WHICH IS 30,000 FEET. THERE WAS NO SOUND. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED FOR ABOUT 20 SECONDS.
