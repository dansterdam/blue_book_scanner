Now any American with a little common horse sense, knows just about how far advanced we really are and all this sweet talk and pretty talk and what have you doesn't alter the facts of the case. Now, I did my duty as a citizen. I reported this incident. I was not even shown enough consideration to be called a liar, a fool, a crackpot, or what have you. Privately I have probably been called everything in the book. I always like to close quarters (7) with people who particularly like to smear me. I like to just verbally beat their brains out. And your haven't got a thing on General on him, you haven't got anybody with the voice, the psychic power or anything else, who can annoy me or alarm me.
