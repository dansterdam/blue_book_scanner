The text in the document reads:

The sighting of not more than one minute's duration appeared to be a flat, brilliantly lighted, metallic object of large size which moved at a very high speed over the sea leaving no trace. Its apparent size was that of a dinner plate, and it seemed to be about 15 to 20 feet above the water. The object disappeared in the direction of Utlangan before the observer had time to take a clear look and estimate its size more definitely. The brilliant light radiated was observed for perhaps 5 to 10 seconds.
CONCLUSION: The observer was unable to form a definite opinion as to the nature of the object observed, but stated that the sighting was so brief that he could not be certain as to its exact size, shape, or distance. The behavior of the object, however, appeared to be unlike any known conventional aircraft.
