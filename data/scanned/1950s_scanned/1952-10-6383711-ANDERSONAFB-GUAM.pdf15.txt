SUBJECT: SIGHTING OF STRANGE OBJECTS OR LIGHTS

TO : CHAIRMAN, INTELLIGENCE OFFICER

1. The following report is submitted as results the sighting of a strange object in the sky on the night of 7 October 1952.

On 7 October 1952, at approximately 2030 hours, I was on duty at the Anderson Control Tower at Anderson Air Force Base. While on duty, I observed a strange object in the sky. This object appeared to be approximately 7 to 9 miles to the west of the Anderson Control Tower. The object was first observed to the west, at approximately 30 to 45 degrees above the horizon. It appeared to be circular in shape, with a reddish-orange glow surrounding it. The object remained stationary for approximately 8 to 10 minutes, and then began to move in a northerly direction at a very rapid rate of speed. The object was observed to move across the sky for a distance of approximately 30 to 45 degrees, and then it appeared to stop and hover again for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The object then began to move in a southerly direction at the same rapid rate of speed, and continued this path of flight for approximately 30 to 45 degrees across the sky. The object then appeared to stop and hover again for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. This pattern of flight was repeated 3 times, with the object moving in a northerly direction, stopping and hovering, then moving in a southerly direction, stopping and hovering, and then repeating this pattern. 

The total time of the sighting was approximately 30 minutes. The object was very bright and clearly visible, and there was no noise or trail of any kind associated with the object. The sky was clear, with a few scattered clouds, and the visibility was excellent.

I immediately reported the sighting to the Anderson Control Tower, and the Air Force officials on duty were notified. They concurred with my observations, and indicated that they had also observed the strange object. They further stated that they had no explanation for the object, and that they were unable to identify it.

I have submitted this report in accordance with the instructions contained in Air Force Regulation 200-2, concerning the reporting of unidentified flying objects. I trust that this report will be of assistance in the investigation of this incident.
