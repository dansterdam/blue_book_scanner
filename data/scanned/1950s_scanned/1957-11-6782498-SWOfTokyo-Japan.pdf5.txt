COMMENTS: (Narrative style, expand on your evaluation and analyze) This report describes a visual sighting of unidentified flying objects over Tokyo, Japan on 6 November 1957. The observer (a Tokyo resident) gave the following description: "At approximately 8:25 p.m. on 6 November 1957, I observed three circular, luminous objects in the sky over Tokyo. The objects were traveling at a high rate of speed and were maneuvering in unison. They appeared to be under intelligent control. The objects were visible for approximately 30 seconds before disappearing from view." The observer reported the incident to the local police station. 
1. This case can be properly evaluated or analyzed towards some valid conclusion on the identity of the UFOs.
2. US and overseas units should measure all efforts to complete investigations and local checks, to identify UFOs or to obtain sufficient data, which, without confirmation of the reporting unit's conclusions (i.e., contents of the report), an analysis can be made. Ref: AFR 200-2.
3. Attempts made could have been obtained if operations or investigations were as outlined in par. 5, AFR 200-2, particularly checks with military and civil air operations, to include radar units if anything unusual or aircraft were seen in the air at the time reported.
4. Using minimum "time-in-sight" of 30 seconds, doubt arises if object was a jet aircraft traveling at supersonic speed. Jet objects are generally observable for 5 - 7 seconds or by. Factors, such as altitude, size and speed, are all factors which can be determined if complete instrumentation and adequate investigative checkpoints were obtained.
5. There is a considerable amount of air traffic crisscrossing Japan. Checks show close with our own military guards. Particularly in air lanes or civil air traffic areas, which could be visually confused as being unidentified until recognition.
No comment or subsequent action required here as the incident apparently seems to be a normal air operation.
