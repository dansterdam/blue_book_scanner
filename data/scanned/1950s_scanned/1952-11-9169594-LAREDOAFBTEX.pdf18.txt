STATEMENT

AACS I C. Carnahan, Laredo AFB, Tex., AP 17 342 039, a member of the 1922-8 MACS through Control Tower Operator, when checked the objekt in the Control Tower 8 Nov at 1925Z. This object was a strange objekt which travelled at a tremendous rate of speed, and disappeared. I first noticed the objekt while on duty. It travelled straight and level and then climbed at a terrific rate of speed, appeared for approximately 3 seconds. No method of propulsion, vapor trails, or light of any kind was observed. This objekt was sighted while I was watching the G-26 type aircraft on initial for landing on Runway 35R. I'm certain the objekt was not a known type of aircraft. The object was not a course from type of aircraft and I'm certain there was F-22's flying local besides the one I-23.
