The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document with text and a signature at the bottom.

Transcription of the text in the document:

"It was about this time that word got started that I had seen something strange in the sky. I was back and forth all day waiting for some evidence that anyone else had seen or noticed anything, but I never could find a single person who had. 

Seemed my sense of observance had become quite sharpened up and I had maybe seen things that weren't really there. Or could it be that I was the only one who had seen this thing?
