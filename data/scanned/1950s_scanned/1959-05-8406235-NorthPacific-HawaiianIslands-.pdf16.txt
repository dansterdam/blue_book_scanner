Text from the document:

The object was first observed at 2300 hours, 7 May 1959, by the pilot of a USAF C-130 Hercules aircraft, flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet, over the North Pacific, approximately 1200 miles West of the Hawaiian Islands. The object was observed for approximately 10-15 minutes and was described as follows:

1. The object appeared to be approximately 50-75 feet in length and approximately 15-20 feet in width. It was a long, cylindrical object with no wings or visible means of propulsion.

2. The object was observed to be traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, estimated between 1500-2000 mph. It was observed to make several abrupt changes in direction, making 90 degree turns on several occasions.

3. The object was observed to ascend rapidly from sea level to an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet in a matter of seconds.

4. The object emitted a bright, pulsating, greenish-white light which illuminated the surrounding area. No sound was heard by the observer.

5. The object disappeared from view when it reached an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet.
