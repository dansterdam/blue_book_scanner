Dear Captain:

Lots has kindly typed out my illegible scrawl and also added several marked corrections.

Case 3 - I am still working on. This is the case I called you up about on Sunday. My own feeling is that it was a plane.

Case 1 - I have queried him by letter asking for a fuller explanation.

Case 4 - Huntsville, Alabama - This was clearly a meteor. However, my report will be in Huntsville myself next month, and I will be interrogating further on this matter. It is quite rare to have such a good meteor.

I hope this has been some help to you and I hope to see you in the not too distant future.

Cordially,
J. Allen Hynek
