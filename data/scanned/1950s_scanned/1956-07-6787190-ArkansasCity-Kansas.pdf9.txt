                                            'Great Balis of Fire'
                                      Stir Saucer Rumors

                                     ARKANSAS CITY Ark
                          flying saucers made a brief bid
                          for a spot in the news this week.
                          Officials here got word from the
                          Hutchinson, Kans. Naval Air
                          station that they were using
                          radar to track an artificial light
                          traveling at a high rate of speed.

                           The Air Force got into the
                           picture, sent a B-47 from Forbes
                           AFB to investigate. They at-
                           tributed the lights to waste gas
                           torches in a nearby oilfield.

                           apparently the case is closed,
                           but some area residents are still
                           mystified by the strange balls of
                           fire that came out of nowhere
                           and were seen by many.
