To whom it may concern,

I understand it is the desire of the Air Force that persons who feel they have observed some unusual flying object make a report to your office.

On Aug. 10, 1958 my twelve (12) year old son had retired for the night and was lying in his bed looking out the window when he saw a "flying saucer". He is a very truthful and dependable sort of person and the manner in which he told us of his experience makes me feel sure that he was telling the truth. 

This sighting occurred about 9:30 P.M., the weather was fair, the wind about 5 to 10 miles m.p.h. and he saw this object for about 2 seconds. From the altitude at which he observed it, it appeared to be about the size of a smaller plane. It made no sound. It seemed round with sort of a bump on top. It traveled faster than any jet. He said it came straight down from a very high altitude, then made a 90 degree turn and flew north. It was an odd greenish white color with purple lights, possibly coming from windows.

Sincerely,
