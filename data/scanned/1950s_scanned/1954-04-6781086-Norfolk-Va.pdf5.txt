REMARKS: The object believed to be a "flying saucer" was observed near Norfolk, Va. on 4-6-54. The observers, a Mr. and Mrs. C.E. Dawley, stated they first saw a crescent-shaped object of a metallic appearance hovering over the James River. They said it took a considerable time to gain altitude and disappear. They described the object as about 25 feet in diameter and moving at a slow speed.
