A FIERY BALL THAT STREAKED THROUGH THE NIGHT PROBABLY WAS A METEOR. IT WAS SIGHTED BY SEVERAL PERSONS IN THE WASHINGTON AREA SHORTLY BEFORE MIDNIGHT TUESDAY AND OTHERS REPORTED SEEING THE LIGHT STREAK ACROSS THE SKY FROM THE WEST AT A TERRIFIC SPEED. ONE MAN WHO WAS STANDING ON HIS FRONT PORCH SAID IT APPEARED TO BE A HUGE METEOR BURSTING INTO FLAME. THE REPORT OVER LITTLE CURRENT, ONTARIO, WAS MORE DETAILED, DESCRIBING IT AS "A LARGE GLOWING OBJECT LIKE A FIRE BALL WHICH CAME STREAKING DOWN FROM THE SKY AT A TERRIFIC SPEED AND BROKE UP INTO SMALLER PIECES ABOUT 300-400 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND". OTHER REPORTS INDICATED IT BROKE UP AT A LOWER ALTITUDE AND WAS VISIBLE OVER A VERY WIDE AREA FOR SEVERAL SECONDS. THIS INCIDENT WAS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE BLUE BOOK SECTION.

BALTIMORE RECEIVED THE SAME OBJECT, WHICH LIGHT-FLARED FLYING FASTER THAN TALK AMONG PEOPLE WHO WITNESSED IT. THERE WAS APPARENTLY NO SOUND, NOR ANY AFTERTRACK. THE OBJECT WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF WASHINGTON AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. PERSONS WHO SAW IT DESCRIBED IT AS "YELLOW OR ORANGE AND COMING STRAIGHT DOWN, PICKING UP SPEED AS IT WENT." DESPITE INTENSIVE SEARCHBY THE AIR FORCE AND NAVAL OBSERVATORY, NO CRATER OR WRECKAGE HAS BEEN FOUND.

IT IS BEING BOMBED ON WASHINGTON AREA RADAR SCREENS TO RECORD THE FLIGHT PATH AND VELOCITY OF THE OBJECT.
