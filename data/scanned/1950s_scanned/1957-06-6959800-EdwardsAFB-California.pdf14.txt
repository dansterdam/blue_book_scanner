The image contains a hand-drawn sketch or diagram, but no photographic image. The diagram appears to show the trajectory and movement of some sort of object, possibly a UFO or other aerial phenomenon. The text in the image provides a caption and description of the diagram, mentioning the "B-57" aircraft and a "dropped store container" which seems to be the subject of the diagram.

The text in the document is as follows:

"The comment: As seen from the side, extending the arc of trajectory from both the B-57 and dropped store container to show the area to coincide and complete the pattern.
Note: (dropped container)
