There is no photograph present in this document. The document appears to be a textual report from Project Blue Book, providing details about the sighting of a group of luminous objects.

The text in the document is as follows:

The light spheres of this group, were in no way connected with the conventional lights. This group of lights was noticed through a telescope, as they were situated at an extremely high altitude, much higher than ordinary aircraft. The white light from rockets or aircraft would shine through the telescope, but did not seem to have connection with this group. The lower sphere gave off small flashes of light spots from time to time, and appeared much larger than the others. There was no sound or apparent motion, but seemed like a stationary group of luminous objects. This was the first opportunity for observation.

These celestial lights, appeared out of the northeast sky, and were observed through a telescope. The highest light seemed to be most luminous, and the lower ones diminished in intensity toward the bottom.

It is reported from reliable sources, that this group of lights was observed at approximately 10:45 PM, and was visible for about 25 minutes. The lower sphere at times seemed to shift from an oval to a round shape, and this lower sphere was considerably larger than the other lights of the group.

The report from the Director of Intelligence at this time, indicates, that a similar display of lights was observed in this general area on September 14, 1952. The altitude of the display on this occasion was estimated to be between 20,000 and 30,000 feet.

As this group of traveling lights appeared, slowly across the southwestern sky, the brightest light in the center was observed first, and as the group progressed, the brightness of the light seemed to diminish. Immediately after the passing of this display, it was discovered, that the sky was completely devoid of any other celestial objects.
