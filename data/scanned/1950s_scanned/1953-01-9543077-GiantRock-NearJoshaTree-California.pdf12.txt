MAN: on the stage of all manifestation, within the
light of one - oh, infinite kindred is this oc-
cult sign that Moses a medium that passes un-
seen to all who cannot see; to those who be-
lieve I know - aware of this portion of myself,
a cosmos unlimited within the boundless - it is 
not of who I am, nor of me, but as my physical
form that I may point as an entity who has said:
a voice comes through to you unseen, unjudged by
men, state - love - of the Father, putting through your being
higher consciousness life - for all my creations are
of the same from whence the unseen force that mani-
fests in everything upon the physical plane. Condi-
tions that - depend upon the instrument that you be-
come to bring these conditions that you know.
