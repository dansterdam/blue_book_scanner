Dear Sir,  
I am forwarding copies of correspondence I initiated some 13 years ago in the hope that I might be of assistance to your program. I have never had the slightest cooperation because I realize your security offices would do any more to this occurrence. At the time, photographs were returned with the remark that I was, "too technical" & not allowed to discuss it personally. I have never had the courtesy of a reply for my trouble.  

Due to the present reawakening of interest, I thought that the attached might lend more additional data or because of the time interval deserve some unless filed explanation.  

Very truly yours,
