UNCLASSIFIED
Shortly before sunset on the evening of the 19th of May 1952 we were flying at an altitude of 18,000 ft. The navigator called our attention to some objects in the air ahead of us. At first glance they looked like seven bright white lights in vertical formation. Looking at them thru 6 power binoculars they appeared to be small white clouds, as the edges could be noticed to be cloud-like in nature.
The objects continued to be visible until dark (about one hour) without changing very much in size or distance although we were flying almost directly toward them for this time. They were ahead of the ship's course, slightly to the left and higher than us by about an angle of 10 to 15 degrees.
DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS;
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 10 YEARS.
