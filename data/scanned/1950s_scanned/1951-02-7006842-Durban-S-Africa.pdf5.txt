OTHERS SAW "TORPEDO-SHAPED" OBJECT

The torpedo-shaped object reported to have been seen flying over Durban early yesterday was also seen by passengers waiting for a train at Merewbank station.

A group of people were standing on the platform watching for the 5 a.m. train when the object was seen in the sky over the sea in the direction of Reunion Rocks. 

He says: "It was exactly the same as the description given by the Daily News yesterday, but the color seems to be blue. It was a most beautiful sight and then disappeared from view. There was no noise and it appeared in the sky somewhere near Reunion Rocks. There was no notice and the cylinder seemed to be stationary."

Mr. Douglas notes: "My own observations were much the same as the previous statement. Although I could not see the details, the size and the mobility of the object was much the same as described. I am extremely interested in these reports and am endeavoring to obtain all the information possible." 

This object is apparently the same as the one reported to have been seen off the coast, and reports say that these objects are known to travel only from south to north.
