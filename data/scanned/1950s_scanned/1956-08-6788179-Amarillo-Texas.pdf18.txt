CASE NO. 53-47
JANUARY 13, 1953
AMARILLO, TEXAS

1. On August 6, 1956, Special Agent JOSEPH H. NYLES of the Office of Special Investigations, USAF, was informed by JOHN DOE, a civilian, of an alleged sighting of an unidentified flying object in the vicinity of Amarillo, Texas, on August 1, 1956.

2. DOE stated that on the evening of August 1, 1956, he and his wife were driving east on U.S. Highway 60 approximately 25 miles west of Amarillo, Texas, when they observed a bright light in the sky. According to DOE, the object appeared to be elliptical in shape, emitting a bluish-white glow, and moving at a high rate of speed in a westerly direction.

3. DOE further stated that he brought his automobile to a stop, got out, and watched the object until it disappeared from view. He estimated the object's altitude to be approximately 10,000 feet and its speed to be in excess of 1,000 miles per hour.

4. DOE stated he was unable to obtain a photograph of the object, as he did not have a camera available at the time of the sighting.

5. Special Agent NYLES interviewed DOE and obtained the above information. No further investigation was conducted, as there was no physical evidence or additional witnesses to corroborate DOE's report.
