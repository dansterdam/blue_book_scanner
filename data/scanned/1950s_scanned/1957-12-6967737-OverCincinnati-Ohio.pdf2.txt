ASTRONOMY
Venus Is Christmas Star
A crescent moon and the planet Venus will be close to-gether on December 24, making a brilliant pair that lights the Christmas sky.
By JAMES STOKLEY
This year we will have a real Christmas star. The planet Venus, which has been increasing in brilliance during the unturning nights, will reach its greatest splendor just before the holidays.
After the sky gets dark, around this date, Venus will be shining in the southwest, three and a half times brighter than Sirius, the brightest star. Three days after the new moon, Venus will be even closer to the moon, and on Christmas Eve, when the crescent moon is standing nearly, you'll see Venus through a crescent phase. 
Venus, still well up after sunset, will not be quite as much in the southwest as at first, but will have shifted a little toward the west. The reason for the lunar phases is found in the fact that, as the moon revolves around the Earth, we get different portions of its illuminated hemisphere.
At sunset, it is usually between the sun and ourselves, and we see nothing. But a few days later, as the moon's phases advance from new to first quarter, we get a crescent shape, with more and more of the bright half being visible each evening.
Venus will be highest in the southwestern sky for a while after sunset, but as the night goes on, it will shift farther toward the west, and eventually set a couple of hours before the sun.
This takes about two weeks. During the next two weeks, the changes occur in reverse order as the moon wanes from full to new again. Something similar happens to Venus.
