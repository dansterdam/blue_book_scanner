That is one conclusion to this affair. My opinion is that it was simply a case of mistaken identity, no more really than a prank played by some high school boys, who thought it would be fun to see what kind of reaction they could get by sending in a fake report. Personally, I have serious doubts that anything "UFO" in the true sense of the word occurred in this instance.
