Transcription of the text in the document:

On October 30, as a follow up, Bryant telephoned the Intelligence Office and asked to know the disposition of the case. He was told that the report was too cooperative. He expressed the opinion that the Intelligence Office was not doing all it could to find an explanation, and that the on-the-record account published by the Intelligence Office did not truly reflect what had happened as told to him through established information channels.

Bryant again called the home of the Intelligence Technical Sergeant and asked to be shown the complete file. He was told that the file was a confidential official document and that he could not be shown it. He pressed the Sergeant to provide him with copies of letters and replies, but was refused. The Sergeant explained that all inquirers had been advised that the file could not be made public.

Mr. Larry McCrubbin, Bryant's biology colleague in Nansemond County, Virginia, who had accompanied him to the scene on October 29, was the next person to be contacted. McCrubbin subsequently toured the Air Force base at Langley AFB on October 29, during which high-school students were visiting the site, and discussed the UFO sightings.

His series of letters and replies began on March 14, 1960. He was informed on March 28 that the data would be classified and referred to the Air Technical Intelligence Center for their study, and they were unable to furnish any information at that time. 

Congressman Hardy sent the complaint through channels and claimed that except for the call that set the original inquiry in motion, the Colonel was quite cooperative in the case.
