Dear Sir,

On 23 May I sent to your office a photograph of an object apparently between Denville, New Jersey and the moon on the night of 13 March 1959. 

As yet I have received neither an acknowledgment that you have received this photograph nor any evaluation of it. I would appreciate it if you could inform me of the status of this matter at your office.

Should you require further information please let me know and I shall send you all I can.

Sincerely yours,
