TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT:

Hg. 1701st Air Transport Wg. Great Falls AFB, Montana. (Subject) Project Blue Book.

OBJECTS are moving at very high speeds. I approximate the speed to have been over 400 MPH. At all times the altitude was definitely in the 50,000 ft. to 70,000 ft. above terrain bracket. The end frames of the movie reel show the objects to be in line with a high degree of precision with a minimum of deviation or wavering. The objects traversed from one side of the screen to the other in a straight line from the spot where I was standing. At the border objects hovered for two or three minutes and then flew out of sight. The clearist films or the movie were forwarded by the Air Force when I first lent them. However, no concrete identification or evaluation as to flight traffic pattern. Sketch #1 shows the point from which the objects were first sighted. Sketch #2 shows the exact spot from where the original sightings were made. The sketch indicates the speed as constant, about 2-1/2 miles of motion in about 5 minutes.

It is reported by hearsay that other individuals observed these objects at the same hour on the same day. However, due to elapsed time since these sightings, no concrete identification of other witnesses.

G.____ is the manager of the project and partially responsible. He has a well-known, courteous individual. He denounced all who claimed to have observed the same objects in the same vicinity on the same day. Particularly referring to two radio stations for Mr. X and Y, and returned sporting casters to their studios. This was undoubtedly resulted in considerable financial loss to them due to the final disavowal of witnesses. The results in the final stages of a lawsuit or criminal courts.
