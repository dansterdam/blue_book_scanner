1956,Sept.3--Whenupai,New Zealand-6:42 p.m.--A glowing UFO with a white "haze" flashed across the sky as a Squadron-Leader was landing his hastings-aircraft.Another Pilot saw it,too.
The report states that the witnesses saw an object with "about four windows in the side" traveling west across the harbor from Devonport. They said it was cigar-shaped with blue flame shooting from the rear. Observers mostly agreed the object was flying very low, maybe only 500 feet high, and made no sound. It gave off a reddish or pinkish glow. Everyone agreed that it was flying straight and level.
One of the witnesses, a farmer of Kaponga, near New Plymouth, estimated the object to be 70 feet long, 30 feet wide, and to be flying at around 500 feet. He said it passed over his farm about 1,000 ft. Mr. McIntosh, president of the Auckland Astronomical Society, said he knew the witness and found him "obviously a meteor."
