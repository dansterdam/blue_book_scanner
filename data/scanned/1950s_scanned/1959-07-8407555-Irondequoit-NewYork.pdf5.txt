The image contains two sketches, but no photographs. 

The text output from the document is as follows:

In the following sketch, imagine that you drew the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

This object did not seem to show any form of navigation lights, and remained at a distance and height unchanged throughout the observation.

In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to a smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
