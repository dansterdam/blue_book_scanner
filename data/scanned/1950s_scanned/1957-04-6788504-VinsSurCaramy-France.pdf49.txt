The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Output of the text in the document:

was recorded on a tape recorder by Engineer Mr. Pierre Ayraud and released on the same day on (April 17 at 7:05 P.M.) the Radio Monte-Carlo Chain Stations.

Note:
In contrast to what the press has announced the D.S.T. is not investigating this event. On the morning of April 17 (before my departure) the D.S.T. indicated that only the Air Police would become involved in contact with the Air Police Inspector Rochet confirmed that in relation to the Draguignan and the fact that they were on the way to the site the apparatus had been seen. This took place exactly 4 days after the event.

I tend to have to place emphasis on the diligence and the objectiveness of the policemen of Brignoles. The latter sent, without delay, detailed reports to the Air Police, the Minister of the Interior and several other official organizations. A second report that was made up from my own personal investigation and mentioned the personal remarks and tests (magnetic measurements) has been, I believement by the Brignoles police Force to the Air Police of Marseille where it should have arrived on April 19.
