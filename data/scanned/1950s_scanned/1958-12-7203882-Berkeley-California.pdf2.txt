10 February 1959

AFOTN-1-P
Richmond 3, California

Dear Dr. -----,

The information contained in your report of your sighting of 28 December 1958 has been reviewed.

I love your suggestion that what you saw was the first sign given to mankind of the flying saucer business on this planet. However, I don't believe there is enough evidence to draw such a conclusion at this time.

Contact was made with the various weather stations to determine the weather conditions at the time of the sighting. Detailed analysis indicates that the balloons released daily at 1500 hours from the University of California at Los Angeles campus would have drifted in the direction of the reported sighting. These balloons, released at this airport, so a position corresponding to the location of your sighting.

These balloons attain a height of greater than 30 feet at the time of their release. They are carried by the prevailing winds, and it has been determined that the balloons have no apparent satellite or rigid structure attached. These balloons are equipped with radar reflectors which could provide a bright image when viewed through binoculars.

Approximating the distance from the balloon track and size of the object or "seven mile through your binoculars", the object you observed was most likely one of the UCLA balloons released that day.
