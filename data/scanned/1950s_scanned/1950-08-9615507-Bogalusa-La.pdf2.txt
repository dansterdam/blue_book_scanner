UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT

Sir,

I have the honour to forward the following report of an unidentified aircraft:

1. On 20th August a pair of aircreat were observed from Borahas St. Faith at approximately 22000 feet at 12.00 hours. They appeared to be plotting aircraft at approximately 30000 feet at a great distance and above making two distinct trails on heading of 250 degrees.

2. A detailed investigation has been carried out but these aircraft have not been positively identified. It was considered possibly these having been U.S.A.A.F. aircraft from Bentwaters No.21. Group, 2nd Air Division U.S.A.A.F. Central Fighter Establishment, R.A.F. Duxford, R.A.F. Honington, Cranfield, Wattisham and Bassingbourn.

3. No further investigation is being carried out, as all authorities who might have had aircraft in this area have already been contacted.

I have the honor to be
Sir,
Your Obedient Servant
