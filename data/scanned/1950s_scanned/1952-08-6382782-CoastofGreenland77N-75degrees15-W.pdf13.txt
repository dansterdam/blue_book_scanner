UNITED STATES ATLANTIC FLEET
AIR FORCE
PATROL SQUADRON TWENTY THREE

On 29 August 1952, at about 1555Z, while on a cosmic balloon tracking
flight near the land of Greenland, we observed the following: Three brightly
lighted objects in a triangular formation. I observed them through the astro-dome at an altitude of 10,000
feet with an RCCG foot instrument and instantly unlimited above that. We were in a PBY-2 aircraft flying in a northerly direction at about 150 knots. The three objects were from the southward, coming about 25 knots. The balloon was
on our right; the wind was from the northward. As the three objects came abreast of us, they appeared to stop and hover for about 2 minutes and then moved rapidly off and disappeared in about 5 seconds. They showed no trail or exhaust nor means of propulsion. During the observation I was an communication with DUTY OFFICER and he lost the sighting in the area.
