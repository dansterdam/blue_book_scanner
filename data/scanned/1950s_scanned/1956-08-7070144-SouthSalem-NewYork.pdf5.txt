6 September 1956

Dear Mrs. [redacted],

This is in reply to your letter of August 28, 1956, concerning your sighting of an unidentified flying object. We are still interested in these sightings. Enclosed is a USAF Technical Information Sheet for you to complete regarding the phenomenon you have observed.

Any aerial objects, so long as it remains unidentified, are of great concern to the Air Defense Command which is charged with the air defense of the United States. It has, for some time now, been the joint responsibility of the Air Defense Command and the Air Technical Intelligence Center to investigate unidentified flying objects and to correlate developments outside our own scientific knowledge.

It is requested that you forward the completed form directly to:

Air Technical Intelligence Center
Attention: AFOIN-4B4
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
Dayton, Ohio 

Your interest is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

TIMOTHY R. JOHNSON
Lt Colonel, USAF
Directorate of Intelligence
