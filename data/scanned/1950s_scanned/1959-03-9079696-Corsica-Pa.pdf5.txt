Dear Sir:

An odd shaped object seemed to be anchored in the air when two men and his daughter saw it. They watched it from the point of a better - but it must have been about 200 to 250 feet away. It gave off a peculiar light, and they knew there was something unusual about it. They did know well that it did not resembled any type of plane or other air craft they had ever seen before. For about 300 to 350 feet away, it did not appear to move, the only thing it did was give off the peculiar light. These dimensions are approximately 39 to 40 feet as compared to a small tree nearby, but it was in the woods and he did say that it looked larger than that. He felt it was anchored to something in the woods, but he did not know what.  This object was seen at Corsica, Pa. on March 23, 1959.

Sincerely yours,
