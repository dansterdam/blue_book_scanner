SUBJECT: Aerial Phenomena

AF Cambridge Research Laboratory

1. Per request of DR. A. O. Mirarchi, during recent visit to this base, the following information is submitted:
2. Sightings were made on 27 April and 24 May 1950, of aerial phenomena during morning daylight hours at this station. The sightings were made by irregular personnel while engaged in tracking regular projects with Askania Photoreodolites. It has been reported that the objects are sighted many times daily.
The individuals making these sightings are professional observers. Therefore I would rate their reliability superior. In both cases photos were taken with Askania's.
3. The Holloman AF Base Data Reduction Unit analyzed the 27 April sightings and made a report, a copy of which I am enclosing with the film for your information. It was believed that triangulation could be effected from Data Reduction data to structures made on two different stations. The films were rapidly processed and examined by Data Reduction. However, it was determined that sightings were made on two different objects and triangulation could not be effected. A report from Data Reduction and the films from the sightings are enclosed.
4. There is nothing further to report at this time.
