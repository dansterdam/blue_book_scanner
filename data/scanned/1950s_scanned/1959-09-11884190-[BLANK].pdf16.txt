in the person of Dr. J. Allen Hynek. The annual average for Dr. Hynek's experiences has been 2 since 1952 (statistical study of his program) was performed by a civilian contractor. This indicates the large number of air force commitments and operations which can be directly attributed to the UFO program must be added.

1. Retain the program at ATIC and direct the major efforts. The major advantages of this solution is that the project has been associated for a long time at ATIC and the accumulated background of the original objectives. The major disadvantages are that the project is less open to public inspection, and the association of ATIC has become to some degree a handicap to the program. There would be no requirement to establish new lines of communication and/or control.

2. Transfer the UFO project to one of the sub-divisions of RAND. This solution would require the establishment of new directives, and for the sub-divisions of the Air Force becoming familiar with the problem. The responsibility for this full program would probably be accomplished by granting of this contract to RAND. The project would be assigned to a less publicized subdivision, and education on the UFO program would best be conducted by RAND. There are some disadvantages, however, since extensive coordination would be required.
