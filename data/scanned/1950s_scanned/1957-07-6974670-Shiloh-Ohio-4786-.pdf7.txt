SUMMARY OF IN"
LIGATION AND PRD NENTS OF CASE

On 6 July 1957, ET reported sighting of unidentified flying object about 0230 hours near Shiloh, Ohio, 
Witness stated he was driving along Ohio Rt. 103, about 6 miles east of Shiloh, when he noticed a bright object in the sky. He pulled off the road and stepped out of his car to observe the object. He stated that it appeared to be about 200-300 feet in diameter, round in shape, and hovering about 500-600 feet above the ground. The object was described as giving off a bright, white light that illuminated the ground below it. 
Witness stated the object remained in this position for approximately 15 minutes, then suddenly ascended at a high rate of speed, disappearing from view in the eastern sky. No sound was reported.
Investigation revealed no evidence to indicate the presence of any unusual activity or phenomenon in the area at the time of the sighting.  
ET personnel concluded that the reported sighting was probably of an astronomical nature, possibly a bright star, planet, or other celestial body. The sudden ascent of the object is attributed to the witness' imagination or misinterpretation of the object's behavior.
