There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page of handwritten text from a Project Blue Book document.

As an OCR system, the text from the document is:

"When I came home, I told my husband about it. I'm all this time, I doubt if I have ever discussed this with more than 3 other people. Author I have wanted to tell someone in the aeronautic.

No one can convince me that it was only my imagination, a balloon."
