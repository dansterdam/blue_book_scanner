The following information was obtained from W-P AFB Weather Station on 22 October 1951.

The winds aloft for the Columbus, Ohio area at about 1300 on 2 Oct 1951 were:

a. SW at 10 - 15 knots up to 5000'.
b. WSW to W at 15 - 20 knots from 5000' to 20,000'.

Weather balloons are launched at 1500, 2100, 0300 and 0700 EST all through the eastern time zone.

********* *********

CONCLUSION

Since Source states the object was traveling directly west, it could not have been a balloon as it would have to be traveling into the wind if it were above 5,000' or nearly into the wind at below 5,000'.

In addition, if a balloon were released at 1500, in the three hours from launching until sighting it would have risen too high to be seen.
