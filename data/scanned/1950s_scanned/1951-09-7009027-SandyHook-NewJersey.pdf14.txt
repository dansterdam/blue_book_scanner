Based on the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of the text in the document, the output is as follows:

BASE OPERATIONS BUILDING, WHERE HE TALKED TO LT RCCBS, ONE OF THE TWO PILOTS, WHICH HAD LANDED. THE STORY APPEARED IN NEWSPAPERS ON 11 SEPTEMBER.

TO THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION, I THEN TOOK THE FOLLOWING STEPS: 1) AT 0300 HOURS, 11 SEPTEMBER, I INITIATED A SERIES OF TELEPHONE CALLS TO APPRISE HIGHER HEADQUARTERS OF THE FACT THAT A NEWSPAPER STORY WOULD APPEAR ABOUT WHAT WAS CALLED BY THE REPORTER TO BE A "FLYING SAUCER" STORY. I CALLED THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER TO BE CURRENT ON HIS ACTIVITY UNDER PROJECTS GRUDGE AND BLUEBOOK. I THEN CALLED THE ASSISTANT PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER AND INSTRUCTED HIM CONCERNING HOW TO HANDLE FOLLOW-UP INQUIRY FROM REPORTERS ABOUT THIS "FLYING SAUCER"  

INCIDENT. COLONEL HARRIS AND COLONEL CADE USAF, COLONEL CADE SUGGESTED THAT I CALL THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER OR LT COLONEL SANBORN, AND SUGGESTED THAT I OBTAIN WHAT COULD BE OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED ON NEWS STORIES ABOUT "FLYING SAUCERS".

COLONEL PARKER, PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER, MR MATERIAL COMMAND, AND COLONEL CADE CALLED ME FROM WASHINGTON FOR FURTHER DETAILS, WHICH I GAVE HIM. ALSO, ON THE DIRECTION OF COLONEL CADE, I IMMEDIATELY CONFERRED WITH CAPTAIN HOWARD, OPERATIONS OFFICER, CONCERNING WHAT COULD BE SAID PUBLICLY ABOUT THE INCIDENT.

THROUGHOUT THE 11TH OF SEPTEMBER, I RECEIVED TELEPHONE CALLS FROM PRACTICALLY EVERY NEWSPAPER AND RADIO NEWS SOURCE IN NEW YORK CITY. THEIR QUESTION WAS, IN GENERAL, WHAT CAN BE SAID OFFICIALLY ABOUT THE INCIDENT AT SANDY HOOK, NEW JERSEY. I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT SINCE THE INCIDENT IS AS MOVING RAPIDLY AND IS DESCRIBED IN VARIOUS NEWS ITEMS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY IN VIEW OF THE AIR FORCE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE POLICY. ALSO, ON THE MORNING OF THE 11TH SEPTEMBER, I INDICATED AND WROTE CONCERNING AS TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND MY ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
