22. How large did the object or objects appear as compared with one of the following objects held in the hand or about an arm's length?

22.1 (Circle one of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22.)

23. How did the object or objects disappear from view?

24. In order that you can give as clear a picture as possible of what you saw, we would like for you to imagine that you could construct the object that you saw. Could you make a drawing of that object? Have it ready to show after you have finished writing out your answer to this question.

The text contains the handwritten response to these questions.
