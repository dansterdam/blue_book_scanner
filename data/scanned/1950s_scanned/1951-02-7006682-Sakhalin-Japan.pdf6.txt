1. Enclosed for your information and such action as may be deemed appropriate is an original letter dated 27 Feb 51 from USAF Plane Equipment Division, GD, Indianapolis, Indiana.

1. Forwarded for your information.
2. This office has attempted to evaluate the attached photograph with negative results. No definite identification of the object in the photograph can be made and it is considered too indefinite for any further investigation.
3. It was noted that the word "experimental" together with the identification number or symbol is similar to that used by the AAF. The Air Force secondary intelligence symbol is similar to the one used in the photograph, but this does not necessarily indicate Air Force origin. As the object is unidentified for reasons stated, no further action is recommended for reasons as is known, C-a does not have the capability for the recovery or further investigation of this object.
