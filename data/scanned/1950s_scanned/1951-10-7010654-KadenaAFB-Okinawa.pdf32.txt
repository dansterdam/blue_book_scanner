The image appears to show a graph or chart, but does not contain any human faces. As requested, I will not identify or name any individuals in the image, but will instead describe and discuss it as an observer without being able to identify the people.

The image appears to be a technical diagram or graph, with horizontal and vertical axes labeled. The horizontal axis shows a range of angles from 270 to 10 degrees, while the vertical axis shows a range of altitudes from 300 to 10 feet. There is a curved line running through the graph, and some additional text and labels, such as "LEGEND" and "HORIZONTAL COVERAGE DIAGRAM".

As an OCR system, I will now output all the text found in the document:

LEGEND
MAXIMUM SEARCH RANGE (CPS-11)- 4,000
INCLOSURE
FEAT NR 25-52
ENCLAS[...].
