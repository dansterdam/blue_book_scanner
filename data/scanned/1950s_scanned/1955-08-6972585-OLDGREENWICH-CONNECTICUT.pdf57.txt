The night of 13 July, 1955, about 10:00 p.m. While driving along west port avenue in old Greenwich, Connecticut, I observed what appeared to be a bright light in the sky. This light was extremely bright and changed colors from orange to white. it appeared to be some distance away and was moving rapidly from a southeastern direction toward the northeast at a fairly high altitude. The light seemed to be under some type of control as it suddenly stopped and then changed direction and started moving rapidly in a different direction. This light was observed for about 5 minutes and then seemed to disappear. I am quite certain that this was not an aircraft light or a satellite, as I am quite familiar with the appearance of such objects in the sky. This light seemed to be under some type of intelligent control and did not follow the normal path of an aircraft or satellite.
