Transcribing the text from the document:

SUBJECT: (U) Unidentified Radar Returns (C 2 May 1953)
AREA: GRANITE CITY, ILLINOIS
FROM: ATAG-2
DATE: 3 JUNE 53

1. The incident reported as happening at Granite City, Illinois, 13 Feb 53, cannot be positively evaluated. However, since the target observed by the radar installation at Granite City, Illinois was of a somewhat unusual nature, it is considered that immediate checks of the data equipment determined that this radar target did exist. An evaluation would be of value in evaluating this target unless similar happenings have been recorded before.

2. The radar data contained in the report from Carroll AFB, dated 13 FEB 53, is of interest for possible identification of the object involved. The object observed on the SCR-615 radar was moving towards the North. The weather condition could cause such ground clutter signals to be received under certain atmospheric conditions and at certain ranges of the radar. This weather condition could cause the hazy ground return signals to be received.

3. Following information is reply to paragraph 2 of Comment No. 2:
"The properties of the atmosphere which determine the refractive index (bending) and which change with height are temperature, pressure, and moisture content. Slight (transient) changes in these factors, such as temperature inversions, can cause serious radar malfunction. Low-density air may result in reduced range (column 1) and, to a lesser degree, when there is a rapid decrease of density, refraction occur when both of these conditions prevail at the same time."
