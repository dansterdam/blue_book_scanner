DETAILS (cont'd)
Mr. F advised that he had known Mr.-----, (whose name is blocked out), previously, and believed him to be a reliable, honest, trustworthy, and intelligent individual. He stated that Mr. _____ related to him that on several occasions when he would greet him, Mr. _____ would doff his cap in a special manner, which Mr. F recognized as being quite unusual. Mr. _____ advised him that he had been contacted by outer space in this way, and that the beings from outer space would greet him whenever they met, which was quite frequently. He stated that Mr. _____ was quite frequent in mentioning this to him, and that he did not know just how to express what his intent was, but that "he was honored to be so greeted."
Mr. WOOD advised that he had known Mrs. _____ (whose name is blocked out) for many years, and believed her to be completely reliable, honest, trustworthy, and that any information she related would be credible.
2. On 21 May 1952, Mrs. Gonzales, Texas, was interviewed and stated substantially the same as Mr. WOOD concerning the reliability of Mrs. _____. She stated she had known Mrs. _____ for many years, and regarded her as honest, trustworthy, and reliable, but that she had changed considerably since she had been "injured in an accident," and was somewhat altered in her outlook. Mrs. Gonzales further stated that she did not wish to imply that anyone of the three (3) persons would make up a completely false account of what they were not basically honest, truthful, dependable, and reliable.
