AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT

(1) DESCRIPTION:
Several observers reported seeing a luminous object described as a rotating disc with distinct shape and definite motion, which was observed for about 10 to 15 minutes. The object appeared to have a bright, white color, similar to the color and luster of a weld. It had a circular shape and seemed larger than a star or planet. The object was observed to make definite maneuvers and was seen to change directions several times.

(2) ADDITIONAL DETAILS:
The object was first observed at about 8:40 PM on 6 July 1957, over Hastings, Michigan. The object was observed by two independent groups of observers, and all agreed on the general description of the object. The object was seen to move in a horizontal path, then make a turn and move in a vertical path, and then turn again and move in a horizontal path. The object was seen to accelerate and decelerate during its observed movements. It was seen to fade in and out of visibility at times. The object was observed for about 10 to 15 minutes and then disappeared from view.
