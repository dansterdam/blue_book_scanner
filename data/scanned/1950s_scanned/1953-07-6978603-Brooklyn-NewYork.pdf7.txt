Dear sir:

I do not know what this should be addressed to, but may I present it to the right person.

Last night, Saturday, July 18, I went up on the roof of my apartment as very late in one apartment here in downtown Brooklyn I saw what appeared to be a colored light. It was not red, blue, green or white, but more like a pearly color. It was not at all near a small plane or anything I have ever seen before.

It seemed to get out of sight very fast and just before it disappeared I thought I saw it go a little to the right. I follow it until it was out of sight and just before it was lost to me my vision was blurred.

It came from the east, north-east and moved in a straight line very swiftly. What could that thing be? I would not report it if I was not sure of what I saw. It seemed to me to be very high up and faster than any plane I have ever seen.

Sincerely yours,
[Signature]"
