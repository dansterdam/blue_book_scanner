FLYING SAUCERS IN MOROCCO (2)
Cigars and Luminous Locomotives !
By the last few weeks, brief reports have been published in the French and American Press giving accounts of the observations made by the people of Casablanca.
The most recent reports have covered new incidents which seem to be on the increase according to local LIFE.
No. 1 - was observed from the terrace of the American Pay Club in Casablanca by Mr. and Mrs. Ed Levin. Mr. and Mrs. J.D. Breit and two other members of the Club. According to their detailed report was published in the July 12th issue of Life Magazine.
Different Versions
We note that these five American observers had a different version of what they saw. Some of them thought they had seen elongated cigars, while others thought they had seen diamond shaped objects.
We understand the population of Casablanca have also seen objects of this nature as one followed and studied closely for hours it says the report. Blue-white neon light
The lighting corresponds to that usually produced by Mr. and Mrs. Idris Pierce, who describe these mysterious luminous locomotives as being about 9 p.m. The object was moving slowly from East to West, in a perfect silence.
Forty Witnesses
Party other people saw this incident and among them were in front of the Sangier-Sour four at Casablanca, and a French journalist, Monsieur Germicl and Monsieur Benoit, who were able to observe more details. This group was able to distinguish the speed, color, and size of the objects and counted more than forty witnesses.
Though all these reports covering what was obviously various sightings of these strange incidents No. 2, it would seem reasonable to assume that it was the same object which was observed at different times and places and by persons of high standing whose testimony is worthy of consideration.
