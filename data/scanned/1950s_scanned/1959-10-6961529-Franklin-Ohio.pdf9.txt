The image appears to contain three sketches or illustrations. The first sketch shows a curved line with a labeled point "A" on the curved line, and another labeled point "B" on the same curved line, representing how an unidentified object appeared in the sky. The second and third sketches appear to be larger illustrations of the object's position in the sky, with a person standing in the foreground.

Converting the text in the document:

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
