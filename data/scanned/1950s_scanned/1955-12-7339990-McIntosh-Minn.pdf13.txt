The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a handwritten document or report. The text in the document is as follows:

"It was a reddish colored oblong or whatever you want to call it, that spent maybe four or five years out of at out of a possible eight or so. Their fastest move, but I had never seen anything move so fast as this thing. When it pulled out I little it arc but at the same elevation. As it got further away its color changed to a bright orange, but just before it went out of sight on the horizon there was a flame that shot out again and a little larger. The flame was coming back to where we were, and then it went off some, but it kept receding toward the coast and went out of sight. The sort of thought that this is written in ration has caused it to get brighter again. When it first came into the field of spect it certainly was within less than ten miles per hour."
