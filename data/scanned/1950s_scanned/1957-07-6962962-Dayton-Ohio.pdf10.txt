Lake George, New York

July 2, 1957: About 1:30 p.m. on the same day that CSI vice-president, X, sighted a UFO at Lake George, New York (see Maj. X), another interesting sighting was reported. A brilliantly shining UFO of peculiar shape - like a kettle-drum - was observed. It appeared to hover over the area for some time and was seen by several persons.

When first noticed and the boys first noticed it, the "flying kettle-drum" rose in the air and disappeared rapidly, leaving a trail or wake. It shot across Interstate Bridge (They live about three miles west of the Hudson River) and passed over to the eastern side of the river. The object is described as being about 25-30 feet in diameter, beautifully metallic in appearance, and rotating or turning on its axis as it moved smoothly and silently. It left no trails.

But as it proceeded northward, its shiny finish abruptly turned to a dull, dark grayish color, and it disappeared from view. The object was first noticed at an altitude of about 500-600 feet and was not due to the sunlight reflecting off of it. The sky was moderately overcast and the object was visible against the cloud cover. The observer aid it gave no appearance of being a plane, helicopter, balloon, or any other conventional aircraft. It passed from view in a northerly direction, without changing course or losing altitude. It was in view for less than ten seconds and no more than twenty.

The incident drew appeared in the Bergen Evening Record, July 3rd. Mrs. XXXXXXXX and requested the contents of this report from major XXXXXXX. She was very interested in receiving any information on this case.
