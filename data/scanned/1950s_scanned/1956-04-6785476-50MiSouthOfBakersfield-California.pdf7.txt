On the morning of an April 6, May Day in 1956, while travelling motorized with a friend on a highway about 10 miles Southeast of Bakersfield, California, he pulled over to the side of the road at about 10:00 A.M. to permit another motorist to pass. He and his friend, who was sitting beside him, then observed a strange object in the sky. It was circular in shape and appeared to be hovering about 2,000 feet in the air. The object gave off a brilliant white light and was about 50-75 feet in diameter. The object remained stationary for a few minutes, then suddenly shot up into the sky at a very high rate of speed, and the next time it looked, it was already disappearing from view over the horizon. The entire sighting lasted about 30 seconds. The man was astonished and could not explain what he had seen. He said it was only a part of the sighting, as the man was motioned by a sign from his friend to look up out of the car window, indicating that the object was above them. He also stated that there appeared to be five miles from one to five miles from him and that it was extremely bright and caused him and his friend to rub their eyes. The witness now believes that what he saw was some type of unusual aircraft, although he does not know what it was. He said he would be willing to help in any way he could if asked to do so before then.
