Sources of this report were contacted separately and each was convinced that she had observed an un-identified object. It was obvious that Mrs.___ was more concerned and frightened by what she had observed than was Mrs.___ (2) occasions began to turn around once or few miles WEST OF LECOMPTE and again a few miles out of FOREST HILL. Mrs.___ stated that she did not do so because she thought if the object was going to intercept with them it could do so at the option, therefore she could see no logical reason for turning around. To compensate for this Mrs.___ said she advanced her speed to approximately 70 MPH in order to get home as soon as possible. Mrs.___ stated that the interior lights of the car were off or dimmed during the entire escapade. Mrs.___ and her seven (7) year old girl in the back seat, together with Mrs.___ one and one-half (1 1/2) year old child. Both women stated they tried to with-hold their concern and fright from the children and thought they had succeeded. It was determined by the interview that neither child had seen the object. Both sources first thought that the object was a light which they would subsequently be able to identify. However, after passing several lights and radio towers along the road they realized that their thinking had been wrong. Mrs.___ said that only one car passed them during the observation, it was going the opposite direction. One other car followed them a short distance but turned off the road. No other vehicles were observed by them during the observation. Mrs.___ had traveled this road many times on the way to BATON ROUGE.
