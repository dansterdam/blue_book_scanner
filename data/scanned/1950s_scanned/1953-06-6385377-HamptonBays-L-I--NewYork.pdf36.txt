Shirley Bay Site To Pilot Objects
A report states that "Official attitude towards Dominion experiment with unidentified flying objects has seemingly changed. Down for some time while findings were studied, site at Shirley Bay, near Ottawa, Ontario, is now back in operation. One or more craft are said to be used as test vehicles, or as a platform from which observations may be made of other aerial phenomena.... This Canada-sponsored project is classed as highly secret."
