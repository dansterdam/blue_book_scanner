The image contains two sketches. The first sketch shows an illustration of how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when the observer first saw it, with a point labeled "A" on the curved line to indicate the position of the object. The second sketch shows a larger view of the object's position when the observer first saw it, and a smaller sketch showing the horizon and sky view from the observer's perspective.

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch, place an "A" at the position where the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
