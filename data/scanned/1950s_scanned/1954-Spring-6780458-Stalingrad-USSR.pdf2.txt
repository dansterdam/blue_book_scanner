UFO SIGHTING, Spring 1954, Stalingrad, USSR

In the spring of 1954 witness observed flight of an unknown object from horizon to horizon, flying from southeast to northwest. This object appeared to be climbing. Witness couldn't describe the object, but said it took approximately one minute for the object to leave the range of his vision. Object caused a great amount of vibration in the air and made a screeching, whistling noise which was different from the noise made by an artillery shell in flight. Object could not be observed, only the disturbance in the air.
