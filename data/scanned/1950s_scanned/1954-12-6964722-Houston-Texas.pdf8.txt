Here is the text extracted from the document:

"Please, describe the material. It was found near me, but soon after it solidified, it was quite hot, and I only touched it some time later. It seemed to be like some kind of silvery or metallic object and was disc-shaped and was like a record and spinning like a record on a phonograph. The three edges of the object rolled up and down and were rolling in and out. It was not hot when I touched it (the meaning has not been altered). By now, this material with the spinning object has been removed and concealed, so that there is nothing to be examined now.

It seems that the best guess is that there was a flying saucer, and it discharged some metallic object. The reports that have come in so far have shown that people in the vicinity saw a strange bright object in the sky, which moved very rapidly and was seen for only a short time. It was closing this letter when I received an information that a plane to Europe and returned only 10 days later, was dispatched on September 23rd.

We were closing this letter when we received an information that an American astronomer (a friend of mine) asking me to find out the nature of the material that was delivered to us, in the USA SAMPLE. He would like to analyze the sample spectrographically, which is the method Professor Von Braun has devised. I am therefore requesting a friend of mine, who is also an American astronomer, to write to you. Then we would have the result already obtained by Professor Von Braun's method. Please, let me know what is your decision. If it is impossible to get the material to the United States, this will be difficult but by no means impossible."
