The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a declassified Project Blue Book document containing typed text.

As an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system, I will output all the text found in the document:

"Draw on April, going home:'
"I had it but is was not going out of torch, made motion, went over to the north...."
"Seemed to be somewhat about 650 ft. from use i hear about."
"As long as I could see it, still there, though the time was low, and it can't be any speed if speed. At most I'll 5 or 10 mins.more should be gone, but it wasn't. No sound or glow or fuming, and just stood there motionless like an aircraft but without lights."
"As the car I stopped to have a good look and then it seems to be just above the tree tops and seemed to move sideways a little. I could see it but it seem to be in a slight haze."
"It is still high up and I could not make out what it was. I don't know what kind of aircraft it might be, don't know of any that stand still that way."
"We are continuing c with the object and had a good view of it." 
"The object seemed to have a pale glow around the edges but no pulsating lights or steady lights, just seemed to glow. It reminded me of a distant aircraft at night, only no lights."
"During 5 or 10 mins. of watching it, it did not seem to move but just stood there motionless."
"After that this, the C.C.S. informed that the object had disappeared and I saw nothing more."
