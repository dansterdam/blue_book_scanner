SKETCH: View from Interior of C-47 Aircraft

I, 2/Lt George W. Watson to the best of my knowledge state these facts that follow to be true:

On the morning of 26 October 1952, I was flying in a C-47 (DC3) type aircraft with Capt. JACK F. McKNIGHT and 2Lt ROY H. HALE. We were watching for aircraft and as we looked out of the rear cargo door, which was open, we noticed a large disc-like aircraft glowing with a reddish glow and moving at a very high rate of speed. This craft passed under our aircraft and disappeared into clouds to the south. We were up at an altitude of 7600 feet, speed between 2,300 and 2,500 feet per minute, and this large craft passed under us in about 5 seconds.
