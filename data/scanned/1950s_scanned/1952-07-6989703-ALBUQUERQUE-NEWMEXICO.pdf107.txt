Text transcription from the document:

I, (name redacted), do hereby make the following statement:

On the 29th of July, at approximately 1045 MST, in company with the Los Alamos Airport. I sighted an object, which I estimate was between 40,000 to 50,000 feet in the air over Los Alamos, N.M. The object was whitish in color. I observed it for 5 or 6 seconds with the naked eye. Then, I started to pick it up with binoculars, but it disappeared from sight. To compare it to something known, it would appear to be about the size of a DC-6, traveling at an estimated speed of 500 to 600 miles per hour. The sky was clear and the object appeared to be traveling in a southwesterly direction.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 30th day of July 1952.

Glen D. Farish
1st Lt., USAF
Director of Intelligence
