Office Memorandum - UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
DATE: 19 July 1950
TO: Lt Colonel Harter
FROM: Colonel Pettine
SUBJECT: Investigation of "Flying Saucer" Reports

Mr. S--- memo dated 14 Jul 50 has been reviewed. Although investigation of this matter, it appears that too much time was spent in the investigation. It is suggested that in future incidents we contact the individual concerned to get the story he or she has to tell, and unless there is some physical evidence that if a legitimate sighting is made, it would be reported by a number of people, extensive investigation should not be conducted. This matter is perhaps one which would interest higher echelons who might wish to pursue it further.
