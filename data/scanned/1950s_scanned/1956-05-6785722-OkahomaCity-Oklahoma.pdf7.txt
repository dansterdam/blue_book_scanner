FLIGHT 2-3, 46024 AFSS
PART FIVE of
COMMENTS OF PREPARING OFFICER:
In the opinion of the preparing officer the sighting was probably an
optical illusion. The celestial body that could have been mistaken for an unidentified flying object was Jupiter. The movement and apparent variation in brightness were within normal variations for this planet. The irregularity of the motion is probably due to atmospheric conditions affecting the image. The pattern of travel and the lack of acceleration, deceleration, or abrupt changes in direction is characteristic of Jupiter. Speeds will move approximately 100 per hour, according to the description furnished.
Moon   145 31' in one hour
Jupiter   150 23' in one hour
Venus    130 in one hour
Mars    150 in one hour
PERIOD: Weather balloons were not present in the area during the sighting. The conditions of light were such that they might possibly create a reflection of light on a balloon with the resultant appearance resembling that of a solid object. However, no balloon was reported.
INVESTIGATION: Research of possible aircraft in the area at the time of sighting resulted in no identification of the object. The movement, moreover, of the object as described precludes the possibility of normal aircraft movement in this area and the unidentified object.
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT AS DESCRIBED BY SOURCES PRECLUDES THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS SIGHTING WAS OF AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.
These characteristics of the object as reported by these sources are essentially within the capabilities of the celestial bodies mentioned, and the meteorological conditions prevailing during the sighting, such as the temperature inversions, may have been contributing factors to the occurrence of this sighting.
