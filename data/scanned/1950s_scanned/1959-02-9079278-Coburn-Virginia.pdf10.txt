The text in the document is as follows:

"On the night of february 8, 1959 about 8:50 P.M. while on the way home from work, I saw an unusual light pass over the ridge at tremendous speed. it looked to me like a solid object, large and elliptical, with four lighted or luminous portholes around the edge. I watched this object for around 94 minutes as it traveled on what appeared to be a straight course from northeast to southwest. it made no sound that i could hear. it seemed to be about 500 to 800 feet in altitude and approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile in extent. I kept trying to get a closer look, but it was too high and fast for me to observe in detail. I saw no trail or exhaust of any kind. the light was not blinking and seemed to remain constant throughout the observation. I had a peculiar creepy feeling about the whole thing, but was not frightened. I spoke to several of my friends and neighbors who also observed the object, but they were unable to describe it as well as I did. I have observed a good many aircraft at night, but this was definitely not like any one i have ever seen before. It seemed almost unreal."
