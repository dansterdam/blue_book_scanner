SUBJECT: Request for Colored Prints of UFO
TO: AFOIN-H2
FROM: AFOIN-H2
DATE: 6 Aug 55
COMMENT NO. 2

1. The basic request for color prints of UFO has been complied with (see Inclosure No. 2, 2 ea prints approx 3 x 5", and 2 ea prints approx 5" x 7").

2. The slide of approx 3" x 5" prints does indicate tonal variations with the type equipment utilized. The magnification for the 3 x 5" print is approximately 13 times; the reproduction for the 5" x 7" print is approximately 37 times. The grain size of the color film at 13 magnification clearly indicates that the sharpness clarification would only be enemy and devoid of any additional details.

3. The reproductions indicate that there is a slight possibility that what appears to be an object in space is a small coating defect in the emulsion/or a tiny particle contamination, unrelated and contributing to the emulsion density characteristics.

4. The slide shows numerous physical defects from handling. It is therefore suggested that, prior to further analysis, it be duplicated in order to preserve its possible value to the Center.
