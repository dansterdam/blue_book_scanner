There does not appear to be a photograph present in this image. The image shows a page from an old document, with typed text describing a report by a "cooperating observer" on January 23, 1953, of a meteor-like object observed near the North Pacific Ocean.

The text reads:

NORTH PACIFIC
A cooperating observer reports that on January 23, 1953, at 6:37 p.m. [local time] a "bright object was observed in the sky. At first it appeared to be a meteor, but as it progressed it became almost parallel to the horizon and was at first mistaken for an aircraft due to its parallel course. The object appeared to be visible for 27 seconds and then disappeared from view. Weather clear with westbound scattered clouds, small cumuli, small case: Barometer 29.94 inches, temperature 80 F., sea 82 F."
