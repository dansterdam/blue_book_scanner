"UNCLASSIFIED

On 2 February 1954, Mrs.__________________________, stated that at about 5:30 a.m. she had been lying on the sofa in her living room when she heard some jets flying over. She said they sounded like they were lower than usual and she went outside to look at them. She said she watched some more aircraft, had picked up her binoculars, and saw something that she always kept her field glasses handy because many aircraft pass her home. She said she had been hoping to see a 'flying saucer' and minutes later she did see a strange craft which she first thought was a cloud or a reflection of the moon. 

She said this object was stationary and glowing, and the nearer it came the brighter it became. She said it appeared to be silvery and about the size of a quarter held at arm's length. She said it hovered in the sky and then suddenly disappeared. She said she had called her husband to come and see it but by the time he got outside the object had already disappeared. She said she was uncertain as to what she had seen, but that it was very bright and did not resemble any aircraft she had ever seen before."
