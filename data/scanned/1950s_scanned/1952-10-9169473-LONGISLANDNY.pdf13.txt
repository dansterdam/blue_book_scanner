1. The following joint statement was made by Lieutenants William F. Hamilton and David R. Goodenough with the cooperation of Lieutenant Doyle C. Williams:
"An approximate 1010 2230Z on 29 October 1952 while on a local training flight over Long Island and at a reporting altitude of about 1000 feet above the ground, the object was first observed and tracked visually and on radar by the crew. The object was first thought to be another USAF aircraft because it was maneuverable and the normal size of a fighter plane. However, after closer observation, the object was determined to be unconventional in nature. The object possessed a luminous quality, was round in shape, and hovered momentarily, then accelerated at a very high rate of speed. The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes. After it accelerated it was immediately lost to visual observation and the object was never seen again."
2. The following statement was made by Lieutenant David R. Goodenough with the cooperation of Lieutenant Doyle C. Williams:
"It is my opinion that the object was controllable by something having extraordinary maneuverability of fighter type aircraft. It appeared to be self-luminous and was observed to make turns at very high rates of speed, far exceeding the normal limits of human endurance. If the object had been any type of conventional aircraft, it would have been clearly visible in that we were looking for it and it was in our line of sight. I believe that if it had been a conventional aircraft, it could not have executed the maneuvers we observed at the speeds indicated which I estimate to be at least 5000 mph. I do not believe that if it had been a conventional aircraft, it could have performed in the manner observed, particularly the very high rate of acceleration and deceleration. The object was observed for a total of approximately 15 minutes. After it accelerated, it was never seen or tracked again despite our continued attempts to locate it."
