The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report document describing an experiment involving "immobilization" and the effects on magnetic resistance over time.

The text in the image states:

Plate 2 - A = First immobilization.
B = Second immobilization.

Under A - Around the single pole, only the magnetic resistance. Then one month later the third pole to the left of the latter had also acquired the magnetism.
