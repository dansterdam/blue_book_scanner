The image appears to be a map or chart showing the Atlantic Ocean region, with labels for various locations such as Jacksonville, Melbourne, West Palm Beach, Miami, Nassau, Camaguey, and Kingston. There is a grid overlay with longitude and latitude markings. The image does not contain any human faces or individuals, so I will not attempt to identify or name any people. Instead, I will simply describe the contents of the image as a geographical map or chart.
