REMARKS Larry- We have copied this letter and have 
entered it as a case.
I think the following would be a good answer:
"Thank you for your letter of 4 August 1958 in which 
you reported the sighting of an aerial phenomenon. A 
check of our records does not show any other reports 
from that area for the time mentioned. We are, however,
recording your report for use in our continuing study 
of aerial phenomena, and we appreciate your interest in 
the matter."
