When I first sighted the object I could see plainly that it was round, gold colored, and apparently metallic. There were flashes of light coming from it, which seemed to indicate it was revolving or rotating. It appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter. As it approached I could see that it was definately a solid object, and not just a reflection or mirage. It seemed to be at an altitude of about 2000 feet, and was moving at a terrific speed, perhaps 600 to 800 mph. As it came nearer I could see that it was shaped like two saucers, one inverted on top of the other. There seemed to be a band or outer ring that was revolving or spinning around the center. The whole object was silent as it moved across the sky. After it had passed over I lost sight of it as it disappeared towards the southwest. It was in sight for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. I am convinced that this was no conventional aircraft, but an unidentified flying object of unusual design and performance.
