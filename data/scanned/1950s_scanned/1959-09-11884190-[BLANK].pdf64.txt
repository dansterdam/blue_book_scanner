TIME AND RESOURCE CHARGE TO PROJECT 5771 (BLUE BOOK)

1. While no changes can be made to the program, the following is a reasonable estimate caused on a day to day basis:

Military Administrative and Scientific Civilian 6,861
15.33
Total 10,397

If we assume that this rate continues, then we have 20,798 manhours directly attributed to the UFO program during a year.

2. The other additions to overhead which are directly attributable to the UFO program, other than a few telephone calls and telegrams, are:

a. IVY funds for investigators.
b. Installation of air force equipment during investigation (cars, etc).
c. Facilities used for analysis of material reported as part of a space craft.
d. Telephone calls and Teletype.
e. Military aircraft for intercept, transport of personnel, and/or equipment.

3. Scientific consultant for the program - the annual average for consultant services has been $8,500 per year for a period of 11 years, or a total of $93,500.

4. As a supplement to the program, the Air Force had a statistical study conducted by a civilian contractor in 1952. This study cost the Air Force approximately $100,000.
