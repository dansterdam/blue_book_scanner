UNCLASSIFIED
San Antonio, Texas
16 June 1953
Description
Several airmen in the control tower at Kelly Air Base observed on unidentified flying object at 3:10 p.m. for approximately 7 minutes. This object was elliptical shaped and appeared to be equal to the issues of a 2 by 3 inch envelope. No aerodynamic features, such as exhaust or propulsion system were noted. Object disappeared suddenly in much the same manner as would a light being extinguished. Observers stated that object was quite similar to a cloud or smoke through which a light was shining.
Discussion
A check with airfields in the vicinity determined that there were no aircraft in the area at the time of sighting. The local ACAW required no aircraft to be flying at that time. Due to the physical makeup of the object, this sighting could not be explained due to the reflection of the sun on a high cirrus cloud.  
Conclusion
Other - Probably light reflection on cloud.
