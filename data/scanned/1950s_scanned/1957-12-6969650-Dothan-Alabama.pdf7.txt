Like the moon, it has no light of its own but is illuminated by the sun, so that one half is bright and the opposite half dark. Last April 14 Venus was beyond the sun, with the entire bright hemisphere turned earthwards. Since then it has been moving, and is now coming between the earth and sun. Thus, most of its bright hemisphere is turned away and we have a crescent phase.

On Jan. 28 it will be, nearly, directly I between us and the sun, and this will I correspond to new moon. After that it will become a crescent again, visible in the morning sky before sunrise.

Unlike the moon, Venus is always far, far away and, only through a telescope or sharp photographs, do we see its phases.

The phases of Venus differ from those oft the moon in another respect. Because the Hen - ea is moving around the sun, its distance does not change very greatly: only from about 69,000,000 to 73,000,000 miles. Thus the center of the lit up phase is not, the same as the full crescent site, awl the dTmneter of the full moon is about the same as that in the narrowest crescent phase. But when Venus is full it is far out beyond the sun, about 160,000,000 miles away. Just before greatest brilliancy, it is “only” 40,000,000 miles away, and on Jan. 28 its distance will be about 25,000,000 miles. Thus, at its nearest, in the phase, it is much larger, seemingly in “the sky.”'

Half the night is inhabited with a crescent Venus and half of it with a full Venus. Although less than half of the bright side is visible to us, its proximity increases it. makes up for this, and the new largest area of the sky. Then it is the greatest in brilliancy.
