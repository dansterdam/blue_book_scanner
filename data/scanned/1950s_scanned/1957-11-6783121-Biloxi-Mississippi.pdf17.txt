DISPOSITION FORM
FILL NO.:               SUBJECT: UFOB Report
TO: AFOTN-4a2f          FROM: AFOTN-4a2f        DATE: 6 DEC 57   COMMENT NO.: 1
Lack of data in this report prevents any photo analysis except that prints
were made from negatives that are present and that the streak and date on negative
are lost from the exposure. Unless (indistinct) could have been made on prints
they are of no value because of the very slight exposures.
