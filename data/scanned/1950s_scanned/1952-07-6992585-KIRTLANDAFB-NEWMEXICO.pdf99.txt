The image contains a sketch of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sketch appears to depict a classic "flying saucer" shape with a dome on top. There is text adjacent to the drawing that reads "Front View," "zig zagging life," "Saucer shaped & shiny silver," and near the bottom of the saucer it says, "Moved towards us and then to right." An arrow pointing to the left indicates the direction of movement.

Here's the text as requested:
