The Air Technical Intelligence Center would like to extend its appreciation for the cooperation and assistance you have given us.

On 19 July 1955, an evaluation of your case's sighting was completed. From the reports, flight data, formations and maneuvers, it is believed that the case may be explained as reflecting the apparent circular motion and rapid accelerations indications inside the normal pattern of conventional aircraft. However, the report on the occurrence can be classified information in a relatively short manner. The length of this type of report is normally reduced, as it depends upon the volume of the incident.

The saucer-shaped objects can be attributed to refraction, or the bending of the sun's rays through the trails. 

We are returning your case's color slides as an enclosure to this letter. The slides do not reveal anything conclusive and it is our considered opinion they resemble natural phenomena (probably the one in the metal containers) of a similar nature.

We again thank you for your fine cooperation and interest.
Sincerely,
MARY L. STONE
1st Lt USAF
Assistant Adjutant
