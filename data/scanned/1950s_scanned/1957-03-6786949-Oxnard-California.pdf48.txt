There is no photograph present in this image. This appears to be a scanned page from an old UFO report document.

Detailed line-of-sight plots from the source's observing point and plans of the lights as seen are appended. These give a definite track of the object. Two of the red lights on the barn were viewed through the cross-hatching. It is possible that there may have been some distortion of light on the cross-bar insulation, from random motions. 

Directly in the line-of-sight, as pointed out by source, was a very distinct star. This was seen as very bright star, apparently in the sky. This was corroborated by a professional astronomer.

The sighting was observed through a window. The appearance of the red lights on the barn, with a bright-green star in the background, is illuminated possibly by unusual light effects.

It is interesting to note that the objects reported were observed for about two hours with apparently very little movement. Yet, no report of any unusual phenomena was received prior or subsequent to this observation reporting the UFO.

This report is typical of the many received by the Air Force, which indicates substantial evidence or accuracy of the source`s report. In a number of cases the reliability, skill, experience, and personality of the observer are satisfactory. We are dealing with persons of unquestioned trustworthiness, education, and community reputation, who are sometimes so convinced as to place their signed observations at the disposal of the project.
