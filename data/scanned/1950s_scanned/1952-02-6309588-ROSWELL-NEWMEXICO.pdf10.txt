AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
Report date: 7-2-52
Description: Pilots sighted an unidentified object flying at approximately the same altitude as their aircraft. The object could be determined as to size, shape or color. It appeared as a small, bright, round, metallic-looking object. No sound was heard and the object left no visible trail or exhaust. No further information was determined on the characteristics of the object.
Meteorological conditions: Temperature (12), visibility unlimited, broken at 18,000 feet, scattered (7/8ths) at 25,000 feet, wind 270 degrees at 25 knots. The weather conditions were such that temperature would not cause distortion.
Conclusions: The object appeared to be a reflection on the aircraft windshield, possibly a mirage effect. No firm conclusions could be drawn as to the identity of the object.
