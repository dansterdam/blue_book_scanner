Dear Sir,

Today, I have received a letter with short form from the Commanding Officer, R.T.I.D.A.F. Station
I also received a letter from the Air Traffic Control Officer at Harewood.

I will forward it to you as soon as possible.
I expect my statement that I have not released any information of to be repeated,
as I am not sure, whether the group which contacted me is a genuine one or not.

I will notify you if anything further happened.
Yours sincerely,
(Signature redacted)
