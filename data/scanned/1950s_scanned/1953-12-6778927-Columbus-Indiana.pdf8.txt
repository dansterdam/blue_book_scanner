CIVIL AIR PATROL OFFICER HAS FILED A REPORT OF HIS OBSERVATIONS OF AN UNUSUAL AERIAL LIGHT OBJECT SIGHTED NEAR COLUMBUS, INDIANA, ON THE NIGHT OF 6 DECEMBER 1953.

HIS REPORT STATES THAT HE FIRST OBSERVED THE OBJECT WHILE ENROUTE FROM PITTSBURGH TO INDIANAPOLIS. HE STATES THAT THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 2 FT IN DIAMETER AND TRAVELING AT AN ESTIMATED SPEED OF ABOUT 700 MPH. THE OBJECT WAS OBSERVED TO MAINTAIN A STEADY COURSE AND ALTITUDE UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED FROM HIS VIEW BY PASSING BEHIND A CLOUD.

UNTIL THE CLOUD OBSCURED THE OBJECT, HIS OBSERVATION LASTED ABOUT 5 MILES. TWO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES BY PILOT COPILOT NAVIGATOR CONFIRM HIS REPORT.
