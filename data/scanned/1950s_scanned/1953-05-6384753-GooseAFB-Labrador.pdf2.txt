SAGINTSUM No. 726 - Goose Bay, Labrador
At 0302Z and at 0325Z on 2 May 1953, two unidentified objects were observed from Goose Bay Control Tower. This sighting was investigated by an F-94 pilot, who was scrambled to intercept the objects. The pilot tried but could not make visual contact with the objects. The objects were first sighted by the F-94 controller, and were described as luminous and approximately 500 yards in length. According to this source, the light was probably an unidentified a/c.
The second observation was also from the air, when the pilot and copilot of a commercial airlines reported sighting two luminous objects approximately 500 yards off the right wing of their a/c. The plane was located 120 miles SE of Goose Bay at the time of sighting.

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS; DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
