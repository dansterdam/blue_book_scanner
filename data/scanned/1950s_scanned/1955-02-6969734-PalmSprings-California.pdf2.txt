WELLINGTON, February 9 - 
A mysterious explosion of terrific force had shaken the west coast of New Zealand's South Island the day before.

Eyewitnesses reported a mysterious object was observed in the sky near Greymouth. The object described as cigar-shaped and emitting a dazzling light and traveling at high speed. They said it lost altitude as it moved inland toward the Southern Alps.

The explosion was heard and felt in an area of several hundred square miles."
