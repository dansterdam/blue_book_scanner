The image appears to contain a newspaper article with a photograph. The photograph shows a man named Ralph C. Mayher, who is described as being involved in the investigation of a "flying saucer" film.

The text of the document is as follows:

Flying Saucer' Film Elusive, Too
BY WILSON HIRSCHFIELD
A news correspondent over the telephone last night from the Air Intelligence Center files has failed to elicit any information about a film showing a "flying saucer" which was purportedly sent to a naval base. It was earlier reported that, since the film was originally submitted to a naval base, it must remain with naval intelligence.
The Pentagon letter was signed by Lt. Col. King, Deputy Chief of Defense Intelligence. The picture has never then wired to the Miami Information Center, as earlier rumored.
RALPH C. MAYHER
tells in hush-hush investigation of flying saucers. Shooting 16 feet of film that summer night, Mayher said he watched the mysterious object dart across the sky, change in size and form. He said it was about 2,000 feet distant.
Later, he said, he interviewed three airline pilots who saw the mysterious object that night. Hoping for another chance to film, Mayher kept many night watches on the chance it might appear again. But he never saw it again.
He believes that the flying saucers are from another world which he believes will soon visit us.
