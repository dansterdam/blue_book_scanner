no long, visable. When I 
first reached the tower & actually 
saw this light I observed it for 
2 or 3 minutes before I called 
the 46th F.I.S. Hock Room & requested 
the airman on duty to call the 
770th AC & W. In turn the 770th 
AC & W controller called 265th
AC & W. However, He, wherever stat 
the since the object waslooked they 
would not scramble an aircraft. 
I left the tower at approximately 
2145 and at that time no trace 
of the object was visible
