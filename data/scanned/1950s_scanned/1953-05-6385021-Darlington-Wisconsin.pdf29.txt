The image contains two illustrations depicting atmospheric density and elevation levels. The first illustration shows a side-view of the atmospheric density at sea level, with labels indicating the altitude in feet. The second illustration shows a side-view of a mountainous terrain at an elevation of 5000 feet, with similar altitude labels.

LOSS OF AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE DURING HOT WEATHER

This Air Reduction Life. You see this jet engine can function in hot weather. This lowers the temperature, the thinner the air.

Do you realize that Kansas City Airport with an elevation of 744 feet above see level can have an effective elevation identical to Denver, Colorado, at 5,279 feet above sea level, under condition of extreme heat and low pressure?

Do you realize that Brees Airport at Laramie, Wyoming, at 7,273 feet above sea level, can be above the safe operational altitude of your aircraft during hot weather?

Note: The effective elevation of Brees Airport is 8,997, for example, to 10,500 feet-Caution: The aircraft may lose a higher altitude, have an efficiency of engine and propeller, and become a pilots rate of climb. A typical 5,500 feet rate of climb may be reduced to only 525 feet per minute.

This plane might be able to clear a 400 foot hill or factory stack, located a few miles from a sea level airport, but if the pilot tried to gain 2,500 feet or above the middle or the obstruction - Remember: Any increase in operating altitude due to elevation or high temperature greatly increases takeoff and landing roll.
