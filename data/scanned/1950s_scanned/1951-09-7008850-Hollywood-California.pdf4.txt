Transcription of the text:

Nadirs away down under. They did not come from the direction of either mars, or pluto for both were posted in the sign of Leo, in the fifth division of the chart, about halfway between the nadir and the western horizon.

For obvious reasons they did not come from either Mercury or Venus, because these two have orbits within the orbit of the earth, while the ships in question came from far beyond the Earth's orbit, or, I should say, outside of the Earth's orbit. Besides, Venus and Mercury were posted in Virgo, and so was the Sun and they were in the sixth division, i_ntercepted and below the horizon (western).

That leaves us with three remaining possibilities, as follows:

(a) SATURN -- in libra 2.45, only 5.50 below the western horizon.

(b) NEPTUNE -- in libra 17.55, setting. A sure possibility than saturn for the nomination.

(c) PLUTO -- in libra about 16 degrees, setting.

Of course, only those of you who have read my book "FORBIDDEN PLANET" will recognize the name of this plane, not yet known to our mighty astronomers. The first edition of the book was published in 1919; another in 1921 and another edition in 1922. The New York Public Library may still have some copies. I then mentioned that there were 2 other planets to our solar system and named the one beyond Neptune "PLANET X", They called it "PLUTO" in 1930 and named it "PLUTO" which they have not yet claimed to have discovered.
