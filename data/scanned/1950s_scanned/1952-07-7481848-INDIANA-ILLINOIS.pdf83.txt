This page of the document does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a textual description discussing various aspects of a "2-dimensional projection" or "UFO projection". The text mentions that the "minimum silhouette" of the UFO should be considered its "minimum silhouette". It also notes that if the object were truly 2-dimensional, it would show no silhouette. The text analyzes the characteristics and implications of this "projection" phenomenon.

The full text of the document is as follows:

Perhaps you may think me guilty of excessive counsel, but there is another thought that occurs to me in connection with fighting.

This U.F.O. presented many of the aspects of a 2 dimensional "projection";--we are all familiar with the manner in which a wire, which is actually a 3 dimensional object, can be made to appear as a 2 dimensional "minimum silhouette" by a point-like source of light. The U.F.O. did quite the same thing--it presented a "minimum silhouette" which may have been its actual maximum size, or it may have been only a projection of a much larger 3 dimensional object.

It is quite natural that if it were 2 dimensional, it would show no silhouette at all. Therefore, one is led to wonder whether this "minimum silhouette" was not in reality the maximum size of an object projected in 2 dimensions. In that case, the real 3 dimensional object may have been much larger.
