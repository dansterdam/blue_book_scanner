Mexican Saucers

MEXICO CITY, March 14. - Trained aircraft observers confirmed reports today of hundreds of persons who observed "flying saucers" over this city yesterday and one at Monterrey, 580 miles north. Official observers said they were "far from describing them as saucers but admitting that they were observing phenomena they could not explain."

13,000 to 40,000 Feet Up.
The observers said the objects at the Mexico City airport calculated their altitude at between 33,000 and 40,000 feet. They used weather balloons and tracking instruments to make their reckonings.

An airline weatherman said he "thought the objects he saw were an illusion." However, the chief observer of the Mexican Aviation Company said the case was unexplained.
Mr. Smith watched it through a telescope. "It was there," said Mr. Smith. "It was no illusion."  

Lt. Col. E.J. Ruppelt, a veteran employee of the airport commander's office, said he saw all four of the objects. He said they appeared to be the size of a silver peso. Other observers guessed they were about 100 feet in diameter.

At Monterrey the government inspector Francisco Martinez said he watched a flying body which moved in a zigzag line from southwest to northeast.
