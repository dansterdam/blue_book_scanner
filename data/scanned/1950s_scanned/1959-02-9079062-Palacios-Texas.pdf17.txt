The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a page from an old UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

Text extracted from the document:

BE BLUE WAS TO VIEWER WHICH A SMALL WHITE LIGHT. IT SUDDENLY SPREAD OUT IN A BRIGHT BLUE BURST OR EXPLOSION AND A SMALL WHITE LIGHT REMAINED. IT COULD NOT BE A STAR OR PLANET SINCE IT WAS TOO BRIGHT AND SUDDEN AND DURING DAYTIME. 

IT WAS TO HAVE BEEN ABOUT 3 MILES DISTANT AND 100 YARDS ABOVE THE GROUND. IT HAD PERFECT CONTROL AND ABILITY AT ALL TIMES. IMPOSSIBLE UNLESS DISTANCE IS VERY GREAT.

HOW LARGE DID THE OBJECT OR OBJECTS APPEAR AS COMPARED WITH ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OBJECTS HELD IN THE HAND:

(Circle One): ( 1 ) HEAD OF A PIN, ( 2 ) PEA, ( 3 ) NICKEL, ( 4 ) DIME, ( 5 ) HALF DOLLAR, ( 6 ) SILVER DOLLAR, ( 7 ) BASEBALL.

22.1 (Circle One of the following to indicate how certain you are of your answer to Question 22):
a. Certain, b. Fairly certain, c. Not very sure, d. Uncertain.

23. HOW DID THE OBJECT OR OBJECTS DISAPPEAR FROM VIEW? IT GRADUALLY FADED SMALLER.

24. IN ORDER THAT WE CAN GIVE AS CLEAR A PICTURE AS POSSIBLE OF WHAT YOU SAW, WE WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO IMAGINE THAT YOU COULD CONSTRUCT THE OBJECT THAT YOU SAW. OF WHAT MATERIAL WOULD YOU MAKE IT? HOW LARGE WOULD IT BE, AND WHAT SHAPE? EXPLAIN HOW IT COULD PERFORM THE MOTIONS THAT YOU SAW IT MAKE.

IT WOULD BE OF SHEET IRON NEAR PROPER SHAPES AS POSSIBLE IN A DANKNESS ROOM WITH A SPOTLIGHT ATTACHED. IT WOULD BE MUCH LARGER THAN THE OBJECT SEEN, PROBABLY 8 TO 10 FEET ACROSS. IT COULD THEN BE MOVED MECHANICALLY TO SHOW THE DESCRIBED MOTION WITH PERIODIC SHORT FLASHES WITH RED AND BLUE LIGHTS TO MATCH THE OBSERVED EFFECTS. TWO TIMES COULD CREATE THE EFFECT OBSERVED, WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFICULTY AND EXPENSE.
