On May 13, 1957, two men observed a UFO hovering over Terre Haute, Indiana. The object, which was first observed at 10:35 PM, was described as round, bright orange in color, and appearing to be about 40 feet in diameter. It was seen floating above the trees at an estimated height of 250-300 feet. The object remained stationary for several minutes, during which time the observers watched it through binoculars. It then began to move slowly, picking up speed, and disappeared from sight within a few seconds. The witnesses reported that the UFO made no sound.
