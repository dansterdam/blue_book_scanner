On the trailing edge of the wing were 6 to 8 pairs of round glowing white lights, located between the dark stripes on the underside of the wing. The lights appeared to be very brilliant, and there were 12 to 16 lights in all. The object was traveling at an estimated speed of 300 miles per hour. It was traveling in a straight and level course at an altitude of 8000 to 10,000 feet. No method of propulsion was visible, nor could any sound be heard. The object appeared to be very positive about his observation. It is familiar with all types of aircraft, and apparently this object was very positive about his observation.

Action: Attempts are being made to locate other persons who may have observed this object, and if any positive information is developed, the results will be forwarded to your Headquarters.
