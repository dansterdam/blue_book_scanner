The image does not contain a photograph. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book report, featuring handwritten text describing an unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting.

The text reads:

NORTH CAROLINA -------- COMPANY
PLYMOUTH, N.C. 1-14-1959

U.S. Air Force Operation "Moon Watch"
Washington, D.C.

On 1-10-59 at 6:10 PM near Plymouth, N.C. I saw a white object fly over coming from the north by east. When the object was directly overhead it appeared to be across the sky in many directions. It would stop and just hold perfectly still, then dart off in another direction. This same time some boys from Fort Bragg, N.C. were on 20 mile road and saw the same object. They called it a freight train car. In their fright they said it recovered and flew off, but I looked at that "Freight train car" and I think someone was mistaken. The way it performed, I think someone was frightened when seeing this.
