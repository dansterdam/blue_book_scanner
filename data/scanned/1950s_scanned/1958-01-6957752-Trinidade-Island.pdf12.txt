INFORMATION REPORT

FROM: U.S. Naval Attache, Rio

REPORT NO.: 59-59 DATE: 17 March 1958

Offended because I don't doubt the authenticity of your photos but I need to obtain information regarding them. There are no marks on the photos or anything to indicate specialized trick photography but not one would withstand close and detailed examination.

The Brazilian Navy stated immediately after the photographs were taken that the object appearing in the photos was not a real object. However, the original negatives were sent to the other armed forces "and to the committee set up by the Brazilian Government to investigate the incident." After a long period of time the committee became convinced of the veracity of the happening.

On the Trinidade incident, the press for some time was prohibited from the publication in the press. The Navy Ministry finally made an official statement, in which was said that "The object photographed cannot be the result of trick photography, nor of optical illusions. This Cabinet declares that the only information of this nature which it can release to the public is that which emanates directly from the Admiralty."

I personally visited Trinidade Island at the invitation of the Navy, and in the presence of seven high-ranking naval officers, made detailed photographs of the terrain, vegetation and so on, but I cannot make any pronouncement concerning the object seen because the photographs obtained of the object cannot be made public.

WESTWARD THE ALLIANCE AND THE BARGAINING POWER go. But why? The reasons are complex, and the evidence as yet is not complete. Not since the decline of the Roman Empire in the West, some 1500 years ago, has the West seen such a loss of power and prestige.
