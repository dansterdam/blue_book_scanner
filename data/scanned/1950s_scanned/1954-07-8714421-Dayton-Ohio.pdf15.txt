COMMENTS: Captain Charles C. Sedam of s-83, 96th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy, 11th Bombardment Wing, Heavy, devised his celestial navigation techniques of 1/400 flying hours as a radar observer. Those techniques enabled him to track objects which were as small as a quarter inch on the radar scope before. In fact I was tracking one a couple of hours before these things showed up... I'm sure it wasn't interference, and because of the old Bk-61 and certain modifications I don't think it was a cloud refraction. Send Evaluation.
INERRUGATOR COMMENT: Major Robert E. Neilson, AV575711, Staff Radar-Photo, lith Bombard Wg, GRP.
