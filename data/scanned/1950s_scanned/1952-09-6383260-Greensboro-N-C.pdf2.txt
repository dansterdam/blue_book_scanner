At about 7:00 P'clock on September the 12 in front of my Service Station in Greensboro, North Carolina, I saw a bright object pacing my car for several miles. This object gave off a light which was travilling at a very high rate of speed. It was as large or larger than my car and was solid grey in color. When it came into view it was at an altitude of about 500 to 600 feet and when it went out of sight it was at an altitude of about 300 feet. When it came into view it was travelling at about 600 miles per hour and when it went out of sight it was travelling at a much higher rate of speed.

I have never seen any falling stars and meteors, but this was larger, closer, and different from any I have seen before.  

The object appeared to be about a mile and a half away and 12 to 15 feet in diameter.

My seeing this object, was not a hallucination as I saw it as long as 60 to 90 seconds and it was so close I could see it plainly.
