Dear Sir,

I would like to obtain a copy of the new Air Force booklet "Aids to Identification of Flying Objects." The reason for this request is because of my constant observation which is still by me to this day, of the years of 1958-1959 in mid-summer. My father as doctor was making a house call. I # staying in the car waiting for him as it was getting quite bored and hot, decided to put my head out of the car and look at the heavens. I'm doing this. I noted an object which was moving at a fair pace. At first I thought it might be a private plane because it was circling quite close. It was no plane because it had no motor with lights. All that was on it was a huge florescent green mass of light. It was circling very slow for a good 45 minutes. It made no noise whatsoever. It had a green effect, thinking of it as it was circling down on me - like the "effects" of Tromas radiation a lot no off.
