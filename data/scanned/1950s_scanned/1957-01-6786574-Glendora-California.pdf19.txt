Gentlemen,

Recently our organization has undertaken an investigation of some strange material which apparently fell from the sky into a residential New Jersey community.

I have enclosed a resume' of the case. Because the material looks somewhat like melted porcelain, ceramic, or glass, with drops of melted copper-like material included in it, my mind connected it with recent information I have come upon, about government experiments with high-temperature re-entry cones on missiles.

A ceramic nose-cone, as I understand it, coated with a thin sheet of copper or cuprous alloy would withstand high temperatures during re-entry, as the copper melted and evaporated, thus cooling the ceramic, which could then withstand the temperatures at lower altitudes by itself.

I should like to know if the material described briefly herein could, in your opinion, be attributed to any such experiments, if such activities have indeed been conducted by your agency or any other department.

Please accept my apologies...I realize this is a rather vague request. But I felt if such experiments have been conducted, your office would know, and would further know if the area or results are to be connected in any way with U. S. missile activity.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely,

[Signature Redaction]
