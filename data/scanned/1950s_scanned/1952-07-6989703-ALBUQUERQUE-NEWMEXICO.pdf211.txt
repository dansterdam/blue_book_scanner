The image does not contain a photograph, but rather an official document from Project Blue Book. The document appears to be an unclassified report from a Jet Fighter-Interceptor Squadron regarding a flyobject (cont'd) sighting.

UNCLASSIFIED
51st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Subject: Flyobept (cont'd)

The pilot and the radar observer of the pursuing F-94B aircraft report that the object sighted initially for a period of approximately twenty (20) minutes, commencing at 0240 (EWT) hours. The location was approximately twenty (20) miles due west of Port Huron, Michigan.

Apparently, this is rather reports that the object was a regular weather balloon which was scheduled for release at 0220 (EWT) hours on that date. In the event of a failure in the balloon, it takes an estimated three-half hour to precare another one. It is believed that no further action is indicated.
