The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document, specifically a statement from the 1st Strategic Support Squadron regarding the development of film negatives.

STATEMENT
I developed the negatives in a steel mirror tank using Melamol fine grain developer. All developing was done in complete darkness (safelight). The exact date that the film was developed is unknown.
I take and develop pictures as a hobby. This was the second roll of film developed since 1947, the year I took up the hobby of photography. The film was developed in accordance with the instructions given for fine grain developing. The time was two (12) minutes in the developer, one minute in the rinse, and two baths of fifteen (15) percent acetic acid and fixed for fifteen (15) minutes in an Hypo Fixer. Fixing was done in the tank for approximately twenty (20) minutes. After discovering the supposed images, I brought the negatives to Biggs Air Force Base, Texas, where the negative was projected on a screen by 97th Bombardment Wing Intelligence personnel for their inspection. No one had seen anything like the supposed image before and the negative was taken to the Commanding Officer and then to the Technical Intelligence Office of the Commanding General, Fifth Air Force, Control and Warning Support Squadron who referred them to the Squadron Intelligence Officer for action.
In the April or May issue of U.S. Camera, I read an article in the "Letters to the Editor" column about someone who had a similar flaw in the negative and the explanation was quite concise. They stated the films were caused by bending the film.
