19 November 1959

Dear Mr. [REDACTED],

This is to acknowledge your letter of 15 November 1959 regarding the sighting of an unidentified flying object on 11 November.

Your letter contains insufficient information for a valid conclusion. Therefore, I am enclosing an Air Force Questionnaire for you to complete and forward direct to the ATIC Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for their analysis and evaluation.

Sincerely,

LAWRENCE J. TACKER
