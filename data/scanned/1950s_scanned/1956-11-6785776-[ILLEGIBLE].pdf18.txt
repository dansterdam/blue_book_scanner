Case 275, Petersburg, Indiana, Nov. 30, 1956 - From a man of UFO reports sent to CIRPO by Frank Edwards. with Indianapolis, we quote from one as follows:
"Elvis Charles Martin, 606 N. Illinois St., an employee at one of the local produce houses, left his place of employment shortly after 5:30 p.m. to give the truck a test after he had worked on it. He turned the top of the hill and was driving to the first stop sign when he heard a noise at the rear of his truck, likened to 'three old time threshing machines all operating at the same time.' The object soon came into his view and he discovered that the noise was emitting from something that was slowly rising to the air from behind a woods about 1,000 yards distant.
"The object soon became visible and was spherical in shape, void of wings, had a diameter of about 15 feet and a height of 6 to 7 feet. It was further accompanied by a strange object some 150 feet away. The strange object ceased to make any sound and took off in a horizontal direction, traveling at great speed. Before it disappeared from sight, it made a sharp turn out of sight. Martin is a mechanic, and has been around airplanes and helicopters. He declares that what he saw was different from anything he ever saw. The object did not appear to have any windows, nor was it equipped with a tail. It arose vertically as though being pulled upward off the ground. He saw no land-ing gears or attached devices. He was surprised when it arose 150 feet that all noise ceased."
