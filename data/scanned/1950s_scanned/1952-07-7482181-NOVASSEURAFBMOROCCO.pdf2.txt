OFFICIAL ATIC REPORT--NORFOLK, VA

A DC-4-type aircraft, piloted by 2 airline pilots, was approaching Norfolk, Va., 14 July 1952, about 20-25 miles out on NE leg of traffic at 8,000' when 6 unidentified objects were first sighted approaching a/c on heading about 60 deg at approximately 2,000'. When objects reached point under & slightly to right of a/c, one of the observers saw them roll up on edge and instantly shoot off on heading 270 deg. Along with change of direction, two more objects appeared from behind and joined formation. Speed of discs was estimated at well over 1,000 mph. When first seen, they were glowing on top side, with intense amber-red light. Diameter was approximately 100' (estimated) and they appeared perfectly circular. They approached DC-4 in narrow echelon and appeared to decelerate before changing direction. Rapid acceleration, climbing of 6 objects was noted; immediately after changing direction and flattening out, glow disappeared entirely. They reappeared at once, glowing brilliantly again, and then, remaining stationary position, diminishing on heading of 26o deg. Their glow was extinguished again, this time in sequence rather than simultaneously, and they were lost from view.

ATIC comments: Five jet a/c were in vicinity of Langley AFB at the time. After various checks, it was concluded objects were not the 5 jet a/c. Other checks for known airborne objects were made with negative results. Sighting occurred at 2012 EST for period of 15 seconds.

Conclusion: Unknown.
