No Case Information Only 7 October 1956 Brooklyn, New York

CRIFO investigation of a sighting of a disc-shaped object which was witnessed by several persons at 6:45 PM on 7 October 1956, at Brooklyn, New York. The object was observed for about 15 minutes and was described as being an oval-shaped object with a luminescent glow. It was moving in a southerly direction, at a speed estimated to be approximately 600 knots. The object was directly overhead at one point and was observed to change course and speed on several occasions. It made no sound and there was no trail or exhaust visible. The object disappeared from view in a northerly direction. Witnesses reported a definite feeling of an unusual phenomenon which they could not account for in conventional terms.
