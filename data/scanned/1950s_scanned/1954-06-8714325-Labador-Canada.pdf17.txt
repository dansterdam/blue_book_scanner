The image does not contain any photograph. It appears to be a typed document with text describing a sighting by a BOAC Airways pilot in the Labrador area on June 30, 1954. The document states that the pilot observed "One large object 3 or 6 smaller ones" and that the "main object" was "Definitely identified as planet Mars" which appeared to change shape like a "Jelly Fish" at times. It also mentions that "Strange effects" had been pronounced during the day.
