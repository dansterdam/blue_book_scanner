1 JANUARY 1954, QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

From the air base at Quantico, Virginia, on the nights of 1 and 2 February 1954, a military and civilian ground observer reported seeing an unidentified flying object pass over the area. The object was described as a flashing red light, dome shaped and appearing to be the size of a grapefruit at arms length.
The object flew a relatively straight and level course and was visible for 5 or 6 minutes.

An aircraft was scrambled in an attempt to pursue the light. The aircraft intercepted an American Air Lines' Convair. In addition to the intercept, an ATIC officer proceeded to Quantico and observed this same light from the ground.

The reported light was definitely identified as being a Grimes Beacon light. These have recently been installed on several civilian passenger aircraft.
