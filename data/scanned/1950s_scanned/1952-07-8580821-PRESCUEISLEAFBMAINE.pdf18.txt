DETAILS: According to Captain REDWUS, Air Force Base, Ohio,
on 23 July 1952, the Air Force radar at Lockbourne, Ohio, 
detected unidentified objects in flight over the Columbus, Ohio,

unidentified objects. They reported that the objects appeared to
be flying in loose formation, changed speed and direction abruptly,
and attained very high speeds estimated from 1200 to 1800 miles
per hour. The Air Force radar continued to track the objects over 
a period of about 2 1/2 hours. Other GCI and fighter-interceptor 
radar sites in the area also tracked the objects.

Captain REDWUS reported that this incident represented the third
time within the past two weeks that the Lockbourne radar had picked
up similar unidentified objects.
