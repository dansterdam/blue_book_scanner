SWORN STATEMENT

I, a pilot employed by Zin Air Service, Albuquerque, New Mexico, do hereby make the following statements:

On July 29, 1952, at approximately 1043 A.M. a group of five persons and myself out south near the Los Alamos, New Mexico. We were talking about something when I and all of us called attention to an object which appeared to be silver and disk-shaped. It was traveling in a southwesterly direction.

Personally, I observed the object for approximately four or five seconds. Its altitude was visible to pick the object up against looking back toward high tension power lines. It was at least 20,000 feet and moving at least 500 M.P.H.

The sky was clear and the wind on the ground was north at five to 10 M.P.H. The object was clearly visible and appeared to be round in shape.

Sworn to and subscribed before me this 30th day of July 1952.
