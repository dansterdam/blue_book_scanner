The image does not contain any photographs. It appears to be a page from a Project Blue Book document titled "THE MARIANA CASE" that discusses simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances, made by an aircraft research firm, and their analysis and comparison to the "two white blobs" in a film. The text indicates that based on the degree of credibility and corroborative evidence, the Air Force has no compelling reason to alter its original conclusion regarding this case.

THE MARIANA CASE
5 or 15 Aug 1950
Simulated photographs of aircraft at various distances, made by an 
aircraft research firm in a recent independent and unsolicited analysis
of the ------ films, show striking similarity to the two white blobs
in this film.
Based on the degree of credibility accorded this early ATIC evaluation
and the strong corroborative evidence supplied by the recent independent
analysis, the Air Force has no compelling reason to alter its original
conclusion.
