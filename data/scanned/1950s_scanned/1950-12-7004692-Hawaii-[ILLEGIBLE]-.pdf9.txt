MYSTERY LIGHT FLASHES ACROSS SKY; CALLS FLOOD SWITCHBOARDS

Many Honolulans Christmas Eve called the police, the
newspapers and radio stations to ask about a mysterious
light seen briefly in the sky about 10:30 P.M.

This morning, with no official confirmation of the
observers-collectors, use still receiving calls
from persons who said they saw what has been described
variously as a searchlight or possibly a low flying
airplane.

Dep't. officers called the police
department at 10:43 P.M. to report seeing the "streak of
light flashing through the clouds from Diamond Head to
Waialualua lines."

REPORTS THE SAME

Others who telephoned the police were identified as
residents of Aiea Heights and Kaimuki.

Other callers to the police did not leave their names.

But all reported seeing the same light in the sky, at
about the same time.
