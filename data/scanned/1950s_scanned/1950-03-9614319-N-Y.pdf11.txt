1. The attached report, together with photographs, are forwarded for your information. These photographs were analyzed by two photo-graphic analysts at this Command and discussed with an astronomer.

2. It was concluded that the object which can be seen in the sky on the photographs is the unusually bright twin stars being obscured by the moon, the variations in brilliance along the image are probably caused by clouds dimming the moon obscuring portions of the image.

3. A new moon came up on 18 March 1950. On 20 March 1950, at the time of the evening sighting (1720 and 1930 hours), it sharply defined the edge should be the portion of the moon illuminated. This further confirms the above conclusion.

4. In addition, a close look at the photograph (see lower right hand corner) shows a streak of light which is typical of that caused by a moving ground vehicle on a long exposure photograph.

5. No further action on this incident is contemplated by this Command.

FOR THE COMMANDING GENERAL:

DOWNGRADED AT 3 YEAR INTERVALS
DECLASSIFIED AFTER 12 YEARS.
