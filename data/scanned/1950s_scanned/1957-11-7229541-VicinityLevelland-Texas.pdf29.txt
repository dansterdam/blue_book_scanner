A. A number of witnesses have described variously an object ranging from round to oval, and predominantly bluish-white in color, moving erratically and described by the witnesses near the Levelland, Texas area from approximately 2300 hours to after 0130 hours, night of 2-3 November 1957. The object appeared to be about 200 feet in length.
B. The unusual behavior or this incident was the witnesses by the observers that their car's ignition stopped completely during encounter.
C. In a matter of hours this incident was given nation-wide publicity. The initial reports by the witnesses gained a great deal of interest and were followed by a flood of UFO reports, the majority of observers confirming the original statements. Statements from impartial witnesses also confirm the reports of the cars stopping, coasting without power, and sweeping down or ricocheting nearby. It was stated that stopped their cars' ignition and lights when the object passed overhead, and that started again shortly after the object had gone. Those insisting that the "blue lights" had stopped their cars claim
that were in the middle of some wider circuit during record day.
