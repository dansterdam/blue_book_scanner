7 July 1952

Director of Special Investigations
Headquarters United States Air Force
Washington 25, D.C.

1. EVIDENCE: Sighted by civilian in vicinity of El Paso, Texas, 7 July 1952. Believed to be an unidentified aircraft per attached eyewitness report.

2. DETAILS: This office was advised telephonically, 30 July 1952, by a witness that the following:

On 7 July 1952, while visiting her son, an El Paso, Texas, resident, she and her husband and daughter observed for a period estimated by them to be approximately 1,000 hours, a spherical object in the sky over El Paso, which moved and maneuvered in a manner she stated was definitely not characteristic of any known aircraft. This spherical object, the size of which she estimated as about 50 feet in diameter, changed color from red to orange to blue to white. It made no noise and appeared to be under intelligent control. She stated that it would dart, stop, hover, and make extremely rapid maneuvers, all the while changing color, for the period of time mentioned.

On another occasion, her husband and daughter, while driving north to Alamogordo, New Mexico, also observed several spherical objects, which they were unable to identify.
