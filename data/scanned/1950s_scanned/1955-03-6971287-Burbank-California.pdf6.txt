11. COMMENTS
 Due to the brevity of the sighting 
(Time-seconds) and the improbability 
of further investigation yielding data 
of significant value, no investigation 
authorized by the command. A 
possibility of the sighting being 
astronomical in nature seems to be 
valid in the nature of the description 
and the time of object in sight. 
Possibly a meteorite.
