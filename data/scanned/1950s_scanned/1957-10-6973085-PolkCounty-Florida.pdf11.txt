WASHINGTON
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

28 October 1957

Dear Captain Elwood:

Senator - - - - - - Deputy Director called Brigadier General C. D. Young, 5455, to a large group concerned the USAF identification flights over Polk County, Florida at approximately 80,000 feet at night on 23 October 1957.

Senator - - - - - - was concerned because local residents called the Military Air Force Satellite center and questioned the flights which they observed over Polk County, Florida at approximately 80,000 feet. Allegedly all of these individuals indicated that they had to take no effort to investigate.

The people are disturbed about this attitude on the part of the Air Force and feel that the Air Force's responsibility was not properly sustained. It is requested that quarters immediately in accordance with AFR 200-2, dated 12 August 1954.

Will you please check your records to see if this sighting was reported to your headquarters from any other source. If an identification or evaluation of this sighting is possible, please send the results to me as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
CLARENCE J. PARKER
Major, USAF
