LEVELLAND INCIDENT 2 November 1957 (UNCLASSIFIED)

a. A LEVELLAND, TEXAS, incident, whose nature was described variously as "landing," "sighting," and "disappearance," occurred approximately 23:00 hours to after 01:30 hours, night of 2-3 November 1957. Reports indicate a light of unusual nature descended on the highway, stopping cars, affecting ignition systems, and keeping several drivers helpless for a period.

b. The unusual aspect of this incident was the statement by a number of observers that their car's electrical systems were completely during the occurrence.

c. In addition to those this incident was given nation-wide publicity by the nation's press, radio and TV networks, for the following reasons:

1) Several individuals, in different locations, claimed to have encountered a dazzling light or lights, generally oval in shape, which descended to the highway and appeared to land or hover near the automobiles. 

2) The observers stated that when the light or lights approached, the ignition systems of their cars were affected, and the engines stopped.

3) The reports indicate that the cars were disabled for a period of time, ranging from a few minutes to over an hour, and in some instances, the cars could not be restarted until the object had departed the area. 

4) Intensive investigations were conducted by the Air Force, and the incidents were the subject of wide-spread publicity and conjecture. However, no definite conclusions were reached as to the nature of the phenomenon.

d. After investigations and analysis by the Air Force, and in full collaboration with outside specialists and scientists, the conclusion has been reached that the incidents were caused by natural phenomena, and were not the result of the intrusion of unconventional, unidentified aerial vehicles.
