Text extracted from the document:

VENUS IS CHRISTMAS STAR
On December 14th Venus will be close to where the Sun sets, taking on a brilliant point that looks very star-like.
JAMES HEISER

One-Star is Brightest
This time of year Venus is at its brightest, second only to the moon in brightness.
Venus rises in the east shortly after sunset and is visible for several hours after dark.

Crescent Venus
As Venus circles the Sun, it goes through phases like the Moon. Right now Venus is a crescent, with most of the disk remaining dark.
This crescent phase makes Venus appear brighter than in its more fully illuminated phase. As the planet wanes toward a thinner crescent, its brightness will become more star-like.
