STATEMENT OF 
MR. [REDACTED]

29 August 1952

I was at home on the evening of 29 August. At approximately 9:30 P.M., I was looking out a window at the sky which was clear. I first noticed what appeared to be a bright flashing light in the sky. I pointed this out to my wife, and we watched it for a few minutes. It was moving in a straight line. We then spotted two more, and a total of about six objects, all of which appeared to be traveling at a tremendous rate of speed. The objects appeared to be very bright, and looking at them appeared to be something like looking at the sun. One by one they disappeared from sight. At other times we have noticed these objects in the sky, and other times shoot clear across the horizon. While it is difficult to estimate their size, it appeared to be somewhat larger than a star, but smaller than a planet. Their speed appeared to be faster than any aircraft I have ever seen. I noticed one that seemed to be a more controlled flight, maneuvering, rather than just a straight flight across the horizon.
