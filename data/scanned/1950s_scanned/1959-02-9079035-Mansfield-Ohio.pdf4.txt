Dear Major Friend,

We have some photographs and related material that you may find interesting. As you will recall, this case generated considerable publicity and ATIC interest. I am enclosing a few pieces of paper - they may be of passing interest to you. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like additional information.

Sincerely,
Lt. Col. D.S. Haber
