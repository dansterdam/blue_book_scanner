An Air Force R-47-47, equipped with radar and electronics gear, was flying a routine observation mission over the skies of Kansas, on July 17, 1957. The pilot, Thomas H. Hanley, suddenly observed a strange object moving at high speed across his course.

The object, as observed by the crew, appeared to be approximately 50-75 feet in diameter, round in shape, with a shiny metallic surface, and was moving at an estimated speed of 600-700 miles per hour. The object was observed for a period of about 3 minutes, during which time it performed several maneuvers, such as climbing, diving, and changing directions.

The pilot, Captain Hanley, immediately reported the sighting to his headquarters and requested permission to pursue the object. However, before permission could be granted, the object accelerated to an incredible speed and disappeared from view.

Subsequent investigation and weather analysis confirmed that the sighting could not be attributed to any known aircraft, weather phenomena, or other conventional explanation. The case was thoroughly investigated by the Air Force and was classified as "Unidentified" in the Project Blue Book files.
