STATEMENT
22 October 1957

On the 15th of October 1957, an unidentified object was sighted by two United States Air Force pilots flying a T-33 jet trainer near Mildenhall, England. The pilots first noticed the object as it appeared to be crossing their flight path. They reported the object to the Air Traffic Control at Mildenhall who confirmed the sighting. The object was described as being bright silver in color, disc-shaped, and emitting no exhaust or flame. The object was observed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes as it maintained a steady course and altitude. Weather conditions were good and the sky was clear. The observer said they had no aircraft in the area. At 1904 hrs, the object disappeared from the view of the observers.

DETAILS:
During the sighting of the object, the observer attempted to take a photograph of it. However, the photograph did not turn out as the object appeared to be too far away to be properly photographed.

THIS STATEMENT IS TRUE AND CORRECT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE:
