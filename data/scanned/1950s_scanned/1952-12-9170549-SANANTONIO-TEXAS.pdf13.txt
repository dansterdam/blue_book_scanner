Gentlemen, Sir.
I am a student and I am very much interested in special questions. At the present time I am working up on a subject that is quite debatable-- do flying saucers exist or not?
I read an article in a French magazine which stated that on the 22nd of December, 1952, a technician of the United States Air Force saw in the sky a luminous object (report to his superiors, so he said).
Could you get hold of it and within the scope of your possibilities let me have some data on the subject?
Awaiting your answer I extend you my regards
(Illes)
