On the evening of October 29, at Atlanta, Ga. a strange object was seen over the city. This strange object appeared to be flying at a fairly high altitude, approx 5,000-7,000 feet. It was traveling in the general direction of west to east. The object was a strong orange color and was approximately the size of a full moon. As it moved, it appeared to waver back and forth and change color from orange to white. It was traveling at a very rapid speed, estimated to be 60-70 miles per hour. The object was sighted by several persons, the consensus being that it was not an airplane but some other aerial object. The object was observed for approximately 1 or 2 minutes and then disappeared into the distance. There was no trail of smoke or vapor, and no sound was heard. As I quickly got out of the car, the object wheeled directly overhead at an estimated 200 feet. The shape was round and disc-like in appearance, 30-33 feet in diameter, and reddish-orange in color. After a brief moment, the object abruptly accelerated and disappeared from sight.
