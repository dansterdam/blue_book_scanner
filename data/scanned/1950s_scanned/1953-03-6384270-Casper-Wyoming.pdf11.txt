3 March 1953

This is a statement from ************, Captain, USAF, currently stationed at ************.

It approximately 8:00 p.m., Friday March 23, 1951, at the Natrona County Air Base, I was sitting in a parked car facing east on the Casper side of the soda plant of the Midwest Ref. and Bulk station. It appeared to be a plane rising from the strip beyond the steady vertical lights seen at the weather stations. It appeared to fly at a low altitude over the oil base buildings. My impression was that it was a plane taking off but soon erased when a quarter of a mile (most of mile) as I realized there were no wing tip lights but only a single horizontal light, red (then orange to a vivid yellow) a myriad of stars and watched the light from a few seconds move as I cloud of cigarette smoke going to rise 1:1/2 to 2 air miles above a similar spot I had originally noted it. At this point it was low on the order of **** to *****, by about 25Â° and called my companion ***********. Hospitalman S.N., such that that time the object had directly over us and at a much higher altitude than when I first discovered it. I watched it with us for a few seconds and called to Ins. Elizabeth ***** who was out of the building and without with us while the object continued the climb at a spectacularly unusually over into the of Casper and Casper (maybe 7 miles) and finally faded into the distance. During the whole course of this flight, the object had remained narrowed to the southwest direction until only horizonta-(sic) line moved quickly and vertically to right one last. Occasionally, the single light would blink out for a split second with irregular intervals. My estimate of the total time the object was in sight was not more than five minutes and possibly less.
