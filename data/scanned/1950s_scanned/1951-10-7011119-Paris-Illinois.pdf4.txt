PARIS, ILLINOIS - 9 OCTOBER 1951

I. DISCUSSION OF THE INCIDENT
On 9 October 1951, at approximately 1245 CST, a private pilot enroute from Greencastle, Indiana, to Paris, Illinois, sighted a fiery object just east of Paris at an altitude of approximately 15,000-16,000 feet. The pilot reported that the object traveled at high speed and then stopped abruptly. He stated that the object appeared to be approximately 1/3 the size of a conventional aircraft. The subject then started to travel in a northwesterly direction at a high rate of speed.
(See Appendix V for related incidents.)

II. WEATHER
Clear, bright sun, no clouds or haze.

III. STATUS OF INVESTIGATION
Further investigation revealed no significant facts. It was impossible to determine whether or not there were any jet aircraft in the area due to the large size of the airspace.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
None.
