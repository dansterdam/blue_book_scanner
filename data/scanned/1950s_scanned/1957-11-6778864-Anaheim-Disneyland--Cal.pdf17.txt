CONTENTS OF THE PREPARING OFFICER

1. A positive conclusion as to the cause of the sighting cannot be made, however, an evaluation of possible hoise in sighting. The following observations are the basis for this conclusion:

a. The sodium amber lights of the Santa Ana Freeway, from a distance, have the same general appearance as the object in question, photo graphs during daylight stated that the lights appeared to be those of cars on the freeway.

b. SCURP's photograph has the appearance of a time exposure of night and forth in the photograph, as such, could possibly give the same appearance.

c. From the comments of several citizens of Garden Grove and from those there, including military observations of others, it would appear that the sighting was of ordinary lights on the Santa Ana Freeway, Garden Grove Daily News personnel developed the negative in the newspaper darkroom observed by the G-2.
