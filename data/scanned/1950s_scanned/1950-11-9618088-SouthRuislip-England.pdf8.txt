AT approximately 0905 the under contract observer contacted the track of the first contact. The altitude and low ground speed was considered very unusual. This disrupted the radar operator and plotter to the point that they were unable to maintain an accurate plot of the first contact. The first contact ended when the aircraft descended to an altitude so low as to make tracking impossible. A second contact occurred which lasted about six minutes. During this time there was no indication of evasive action being taken by the aircraft. The third contact occurred at 0946 and continued for a halt. Brake in contact occurred when the aircraft gained a much higher altitude. The climb increased so rapidly as to cause the operator to lose the contact. A fourth contact occurred in contact secant which indicated the aircraft's speed and rate of climb increased. A radar site was established at 1025z. Loss of contact was caused by same reason as in the third contact.
