The image contains two hand-drawn sketches. The one on the left appears to be a graph or chart with irregular lines, while the one on the right appears to be a more abstract, scribbled sketch.

"These two celestial occurrences should have been sufficient to hold us, but they did not. On the night of January 14, I was in my back yard about 10:30 p.m. when I saw the same type of thing I saw before. As that particular moment, I had stepped away from my scope and was looking into the direction of an unusual object. (As before, I was looking for oval-shaped objects, one-bending the other and in perfect rotation. Those objects were not sighted at all, but suddenly this odd light came directly toward me under 100 feet.) These objects were not lighted at all, were completely silent, and under normal atmospheric conditions they could be seen perhaps for a fraction of a second. 

My private theory is that Ellington field, about 20 miles southeast of my house, where many jets are in operation, knows something about these objects. If they belong to our government (power without sound, or light, and perfect maneuverability) we're not got the rest war with Russia."
