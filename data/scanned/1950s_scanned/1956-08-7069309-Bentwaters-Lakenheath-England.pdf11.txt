SUBJECT: Report for RAIC - Two Sightings from Bentwaters. Lakenheath, England

1. On the basis of the information contained in the report as forwarded to this office, it is considered that the incident under reference does not warrant further investigation at this stage.

2. On the basis of the available information, the time at which the sightings occurred places them outside the period of darkness when most reported sightings of unidentified objects have occurred. The speeds reported and maneuvers observed are, however, within the capabilities of some conventional jet aircraft.

3. Inasmuch as the sightings have been reported to various military agencies in the United Kingdom, it is suggested that this matter be discussed in detail with the proper authorities concerned prior to any final action. It is believed that this procedure may result in obtaining additional information which could be of value in evaluating the reports. 

4. You may desire to express to the reporting individuals our appreciation of their having brought this matter to our attention. It may be advisable, however, to advise them that no further investigation appears to be indicated at this time, pending the results of any action by the United Kingdom authorities.
