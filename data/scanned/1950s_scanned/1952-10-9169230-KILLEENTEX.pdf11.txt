AIR INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION REPORT
REPORT NO. 2 

FROM : (Location)
KILLEEN, TEXAS 

On 17 October 1952, at approximately 2215 CST on 17 October 1952, and 8 search of Killeen, Texas, and a recheck of approximately 1000 persons at that same field, it was impossible to find any trace or signs of objects being observed in the skies over that area. 

Numerous residents of the city of Killeen reported seeing groups of from 4 to 8 bright lights moving in the sky. These lights were observed to be at an altitude estimated as between 2,000 and 5,000 feet, and were moving in a generally southwest to northeast direction, at speeds estimated to be in excess of 600 mph. 

These objects, as they were described, appeared to be disc shaped and were observed by several reliable observers as they passed over the city of Killeen. No sound was heard, nor did they leave a contrail. There was no visible indication of the method of propulsion. 

A check with local authorities failed to reveal any corroborating observations. Nor did they have any knowledge of any aircraft flights or searchlights being used in the vicinity of the city at the time.
