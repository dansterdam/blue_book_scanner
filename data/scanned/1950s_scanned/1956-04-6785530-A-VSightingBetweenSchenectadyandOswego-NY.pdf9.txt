Miller: Did this at any time appear to be green?
No. At no time was it green.
Miller: Mr. Ryan, have you had any phone calls about this?
A good number of them, yes, and letters also.
Miller: Didn't someone call you and talk, that *** (garbled) in the Air Force or whatever, and say that your experience and this object that you saw corresponds very definitely to other reports?
That's right. That's what they said.
Mrs. Miller: And you don't think it can be a jet; and you don't think it can be anything else, and you don't think it's an airplane. What do you think?
Neff: I don't know.
I wish somebody would come up with the answer.
I think they ought to take an all-out effort to find out what these things are. If this is a government project, I think everybody's for 100 per cent security, but if it's not a government project or something of our own, I think that possibly they should find out what they are if it's possible.
(Mrs. & Mrs. Miller thank their guests)
