FO form continued
I know every little bit of information may prove to be valuable.
May visual contact with the object be maintained if possible. I think you handled the situation very well. That U.S. jet aircraft had something strangely wrong about it. I think it probable that the object encountered was a nonterrestrial vehicle from some other world or dimension. Can you take a quick look around the area to see if there is any evidence remaining. I gave the pilot instructions to be on the alert. Nothing seemed unusual in the area surveyed. The pilot took off at about 3:00 o'clock position.
