AFFIDAVIT

This is to certify that on the night of January 9, 1953, at approximately 7:30 p.m. I observed an object in the sky which to the best of my knowledge was a flying saucer. I was driving my car about ten miles south of Glasgow, Montana, when I first observed the object. It was five to ten miles away, and it came right at me, and when it was 100 to 200 feet over the car and directly overhead, it flashed a bright light and then seemed to climb until out of sight.  

The object that I saw was about 100 yards away, and approximately 50 to 100 feet above the trees. The object was silver in color, shaped like a saucer, and had a slight red glow on the bottom, but no visible lights.  

This object appeared from the south-east and headed towards the north-west when out of sight. I estimate that it was in sight for approximately ten seconds, therefore I estimate the speed at 5600 miles per hour.

Subscribed and sworn to before me this 25th day of June, 1953.
