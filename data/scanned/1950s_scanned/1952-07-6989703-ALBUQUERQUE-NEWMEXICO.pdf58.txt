1701st Air Transport Gp
Upon reporting for duty 1530 hours 6 July 1952 it was reported that they saw 20
flying objects. This was in the vicinity of Albuquerque, N. M. There were 
apparently multiple groups of 4 or 5 of these objects observed over a period of 20 
minutes by the control tower operators and the crew. The objects were described as 
round or cigar shaped and silent, they were also observed to move at great speed 
and make sharp turns and maneuvers. The control tower and crew have stated that 
they do not believe they were aircraft. It is reported that similar objects referred to 
as saucers were spotted.
After watching apparent aerial maneuvers for about five (5) minutes, I was able to 
pick up one of these objects. It appeared to be round or disc shaped, and was 
moving at a very high rate of speed, estimated to be in excess of 500 m.p.h. After 
viewing this object for about two (2) minutes, it suddenly turned due north and 
appeared to accelerate rapidly, going out of sight within a matter of seconds.
Due to the 50 m.p.h. wind and the apparent high rate of speed I estimate their 
speed to be between 500 and 600 m.p.h. I was unable to determine their size, shape, 
or number, however, the crew describing their description as to their shape, other 
than round, is consistent with my observation.
