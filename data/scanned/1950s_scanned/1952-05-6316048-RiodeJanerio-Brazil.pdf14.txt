PLACE: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
DATE: 6 May 1952

SUMMARY

1. On 6 May 1952, at approximately 2100 hours, local time, a light was observed in the sky over Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by several persons. The object was described as round in shape, white in color, and traveling at a high rate of speed.

2. The light was first observed at an altitude of approximately 15,000 feet, and it appeared to be moving in a northwesterly direction. As the object approached the observers, it began to decrease in altitude and speed, and eventually disappeared from view behind a mountain range.

3. Several photographs were taken of the object, and one of these photographs is included in the case file.

4. Based on the available evidence, it is concluded that the object observed was a genuine unidentified flying object, and not a conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon.
