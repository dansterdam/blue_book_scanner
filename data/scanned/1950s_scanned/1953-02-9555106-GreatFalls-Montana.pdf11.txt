The image does not contain any photograph. This appears to be a page from a UFO report document from Project Blue Book.

SPECIALLY if it develops that the unknown object appeared in one specific relative position over a period of time. Also, advise informal check into Mr. Lee's character, local reputation, etc. to be sure that the sightings are not the result of a "crackpot". 
ADVISE Mr. Lee that Air Force is taking an interest in his sightings. FOUR USAF Technical Information Sheets are being forwarded your organization, one of which should be filled out by Mr. Lee. This and are an AF Form 112 consolidating a report of the 3 individual sightings which we are now making to ATIC per AFR 200-2 as the official case file.
