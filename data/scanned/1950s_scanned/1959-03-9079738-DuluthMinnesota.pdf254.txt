Would you say it was shiny or dull in appearance? About how large would you estimate the object to be, in comparison with known objects? AS SIGHTED AT NIGHT SO IT APPEARED STATIONARY AGAINST A DARK AIR BACKGROUND. HAVING A FLUORESCENT REDDISH ORANGR LIGHT. PASSED JUST IN FRONT OF THE BEACON. 

42. Was this the first time that you had seen an object or objects like this? (Circle one) Yes No If you answered no, then when, where, and under what circumstances did you see other ones?

43. In your opinion what do you think the object was and what might have caused it? IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A PLANET. NO WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE RED GREEN LIGHTS.
