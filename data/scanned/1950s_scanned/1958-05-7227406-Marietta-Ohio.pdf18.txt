The image does not contain any photographs, only sketches. The first sketch shows a curved line with an "A" marking the point where the object was first seen above the horizon, and a "B" marking the point where the object was last seen above the horizon. The second sketch shows a larger view of the object's position when it was first seen ("A") and when it was last seen ("B").

32. In the following sketch, imagine that you are at the point shown. Place an "A" on the curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you first saw it. Place a "B" on the same curved line to show how high the object was above the horizon (skyline) when you last saw it.

33. In the following larger sketch place an "A" at the position the object was when you first saw it, and a "B" at its position when you last saw it. Refer to smaller sketch as an example of how to complete the larger sketch.
